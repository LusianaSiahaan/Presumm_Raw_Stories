Particularly as you start out as a small group of founding members, seeking and developing  talent on a regular basis simply isn’t top of mind. But for larger teams and established studios, it is  something that needs to be addressed almost daily. As the company grows, even the most loyal team  members may move on and will need replacing. Our design leaders are constantly having to ask how they  will find and keep the best people.     The reasons people leave design firms vary but, may be due to a change in personal circumstances, like  getting married, having children, health concerns, moving states or even countries. Professional reasons  for leaving a company are often characterized by the desire to move up or out. Up refers to ambition,  while out is more likely due to dissatisfaction with the company or the team.     In our conversations with design business leaders, we learned that a significant reason people left teams  was bad working relationships. What’s noticeable, is that these failing relationships were almost always  with their managers, so it is not the company they are leaving, it is the manager or a team dynamic that is  not working for them. The chemistry between team members and leaders seems to be the most often  quoted reason for frustration. It may take a long time for these frustrations to result in them leaving, but  once it reaches that point it is very difficult to persuade them to stay with the team.    In an industry that is increasingly competitive, retaining talent has become a top priority for the design  leaders we interviewed. Something that makes design leadership even more challenging is the fact that  larger, more resource-rich companies are eager to add design talent to their teams. A rash of acquisitions  and design team creations by companies such as Capital One, IBM, Accenture and Deloitte is an  indication that these larger companies intend on being part of the design landscape. Headhunting and  poaching are an unfortunate reality of the design and technology world and this, combined with design  schools and institutions struggling to keep up with demand, means design leaders face an uphill battle.     Fortunately, some design leaders have been successful in attracting and, more importantly, retaining top- notch talent. This chapter sheds some light on their best practices and inside secrets.       Small Teams and Building Out    Our interviews made it clear that for smaller companies or early stage teams an organic approach to  growth is almost inevitable. In these startup stages, these small teams are mostly focused on getting the  work done and are less concerned with a formal talent acquisition strategy, largely due to the fact that  they almost always know the people they hire. Friends, family and acquaintances are the pool from which  new talent emerges for these fledgling businesses.    20% of leaders interviewed told us they relied on friends and family referrals for new hires    As these companies grow the hiring practices become, by necessity more deliberate and structured. Very  often these small teams don’t have the luxury of support staff and rely on a more formalized approach to  help with the hiring process. In parallel with the changes of a growing team is the need to change focus  from one type of skill set to another.     “When we went from 7 to 15 people, the focus for hiring was always on billable production people;  developers and designers,” says Dominic Bortolussi, founder of The Working Group in Toronto. “I was  doing project management and Andres  Bortolussi’s partner  was doing project management. So every  single person in the company, until we were 15, or even up to 20, were pretty much production people.”  In many of the companies we spoke to, this was the norm. Early employees would wear lots of different  hats, which in essence was how they filled the gaps that would be filled by support staff further down the  path of the business. As the teams got bigger the requirement for more support staff was an organic and  natural progression. Instead of being surprised by this change in hiring focus, mature leaders prepared for  the transition.     Anthony Armendariz, who runs Funsize a small--but growing--11-person product design studio in Austin  TX, relies on existing relationships for now. “In terms of the recruiting, it's all been organic. Today we  have only hired people that we know personally or that someone we work with knows personally, or  we've had pretty good experience with. It's all referral-based recruiting, or we see someone we really want  to work with and we'll try to find a way to work with them.” Growing doesn’t mean you can’t hire your  friends and family, but unless you have a large network, it might begin to get strained.       The hire-your-friends approach was reiterated by Marty Haught, founder of Boulder-based, Haught  Codeworks. ”For many years, the people on the team were friends of mine that I've worked with over the  years. I thought, ‘I really liked working with him, and I want him to work with me on these projects.’ So,  a lot of it was that.” Haught acknowledges that as they’ve grown this strategy is giving way to an  approach that includes some formal onboarding and training, “But lately, I've brought on two more junior  members. One is actually doing a formal apprenticeship with Haught Codeworks. They've come  recommended by some friends of mine.” When it comes to talent, the importance of your network is a  constant theme for these design leaders.     From our conversations, it seems that startups and smaller design firms rely on their personal networks  for talent. This makes perfect sense until the company grows to a point where these structures need to be  formalized or unless the company is receiving outside funding and plans on growing quickly. We  encountered only a handful of independently-owned design companies that intend on quick growth with  the help of external funding. Venture-funded service design startups are extremely rare and were not part  of the scope of our interviews.     Developing Talent is Similar to Developing a Sales Pipeline    Approaching the talent pipeline in the same way that successful companies approach sales seems to be the  key to finding great people. For service and product companies alike, to achieve sustained growth without  the pains, you need a solid list of potential hires in your pipeline. If the sales pipeline is the lifeblood of a  service business, then the talent pipeline is the air it breaths. For design teams that work within larger  organizations the talent pipeline might be their core strategic effort. Acknowledging that talent  development is an ongoing effort that requires patience and planning is a trait we recognized in the  most successful design leaders.    Carl White of Think Brownstone, is emphatic about this, “We treat recruiting like we do business  development. It's about relationships and it's going to take time.  Our pipeline for candidates is as active  as our new business pipeline. We spend a lot of time, sometimes up to three months, recruiting folks. If  we find someone that stands out we have a conversation with them, likely in-person.”     Even with the knowledge that establishing a talent pipeline is critical, many leaders are still not sure  where to start. The key appears to lie in having a public conversation about the company and the work.  “Being good about sharing everything that we know,” says Brian Williams, CEO of Viget. “We've been  blogging for years. We try to go to conferences and speak at conferences as much as we can. We    encourage the staff to do that. We try to host events when we can in our space, to see what's suitable and  helpful for folks. So just being a good member of the community is an important part of that,but really  just trying to build up the reputation: do great work, share the work, be able to talk about that and do the  little things that help people understand what the culture is all about. That tends to create a lot of  connections and a lot of people come in that way.”     Throwing a wide net creates a funnel that attracts talent to you, which means there are always prospects  knocking at the door. Turning people away is a better problem to have than wondering where your next  hire is coming from.    Just like sales pipelines there will be some opportunities that take longer to close than others.  Occasionally, an ideal candidate may come along, but they already have a great job or the timing to join  you isn’t quite right yet. This is part of the process explains White, “If it's a good fit and it's a match then  we keep them moving along but there are a lot of times we don't have an opportunity for them yet. I bet a  third of the time, that's the way it’s happened: ‘I like you, you like me, but I'm in a relationship right now.  If I get out of it and when the stars align let's get together.’ That's worked really, really well for us.”    Like a sales pipeline, flexibility is required and not all hiring strategies need to be the same. “If you're  looking for a more senior hire, there's a certain point in their career when they are simply never going to  get hired via a job board or requisition again.” Jennifer Dary, head of the consultancy Plucky reminds us.  “They'll get hired over drinks or lunch where you’ll have several strategic conversations discussing your  needs and theirs. It's so important to remember that these more senior hires will arrive in your pipeline  differently than, say, a junior person fresh out of school. Your pipeline has to be flexible enough to  account for a variety of paths and introductions.”    Understanding how each team hires and grows requires an understanding of the type of culture a company  supports. In the case of NGen Works: “The team actually hired the team,” says Carl Smith. He adds,,   “One of the things I'm really happiest about is that we realized early on, if you want people to have a  sense of loyalty, you have to make sure that the people they're working with are the people who wanted  them. The core team actually seeks out people they want to work with and invites them in to work on a  project. That's the onboarding process. You actually join the team that wanted you on a project. Overtime,  if it works out, they hire you. The team hires the team.”       There is a key point to make here: Team members are not adding people to the team at random, instead,  once a project has been approved by the client, the team members invite freelancers with specific project- related skills to join them on those projects. If a freelancer consistently provides value to the team, then  they may be  invited to join the company full-time. “Now the flip side, is the team fires the team. It's very  much like Survivor. If it gets to a point where you're just not doing well, you will get voted off the  island,” cautions Smith. “They've jokingly started referring to me being voted off the island. I'm fine with  it,” he laughs.    Actively creating opportunities to meet new talent was a theme that came up again and again. With only a  few exceptions, all of the interviewed leaders had a specific strategy to add new candidates to their talent  funnel. Although hiring strategies varied widely, the consistent feature was that they weren’t left to  chance; there was always a planned approach with senior leadership involvement every step of the way.     “We've actually been talking about that over the last couple of days,” Alex King, Crowd Favorite’s  founder and CEO at the time of the interview, pointed out when we met with him in their Denver head  office. “One of the things I've done is write a document about how I've gone through the vetting process  of candidates to try to share with the people that are going to be sharing that responsibility going  forward.” At our meeting in early 2014, King’s company had recently been acquired when, because of  health concerns King had begun to shift some of the responsibilities1 from himself to other hiring  managers. “We also have talked a little bit more about tailoring our job postings, make them more  specific to the types of responsibilities and goals people will have in those roles, to try to help people self- select out if it's not a good fit for what they want. To make hiring more of an ongoing process, rather than  something that we do just whenever there's a need.”    Which Came First, The Skills or The Passion?    Recruiting, interviewing and onboarding new team members is arguably the company leader’s highest  priority responsibility. Our leaders are all in agreement that having the right people on the team has such  far-reaching effects, that knowing how to get them on your team is critical. What’s not so clear is whether  leaders should be hunting for great skills, or seeking out passionate people who can learn them. .                                                        1 Alex King has subsequently left Crowd Favorite and now operates his own small business so he can focus on managing his  health issues and spending time with his family.     “I'm a big fan of the scenario based interview”, says Dave Gray, President of Xplane. “So what you really  want to know when you're interviewing someone is how they operate in difficult situations or how they  handle interpersonal issues. I might ask them questions like: ‘Tell me about a time where you had an  interpersonal conflict at work and what you did about it. Tell me about a time when you failed at  something and learned a really important lesson that you still carry with you today. Tell me about the best  boss you ever had. Tell me about the worst boss you ever had. Worst co-worker, best project, things like  that. And what I'm looking for in a situational interview, is how does this person operate? How do they  see the social systems that they're in? How do they handle conflict? I think that's very important. Do they  avoid it? Do they address it? In what way do they interact with other people to get work done? Describe  the kind of situation that you think they’ll find themselves in at work and see if you can identify and get  from them similar situations that they've been in, in the past and how they thought about it, how they  handled it.”    Finding the right chemistry also means setting your sights on the right qualities. “You don't find good  talent, you find great people and you develop talent,” says Zurb founder and CEO, Bryan Zmijewski.“If  you think you're going to find a rock star, good luck.” This idea that talent is crafted and not something  people are born with, came up regularly in our interviews. Design leaders acknowledge that people may  come with a passion for design but that the talent for good design can be taught. “I've never been of  the mindset that there's a perfect employee, a perfect person,” continues Zmijewski. “You kind of adapt  your organization to people that are very passionate about what they're doing, that have a good work ethic  and, respect each other. When you foster an environment like that you'd be amazed at how much potential  comes out of people.”    Hire People Smarter Than You    It may be a little cliche, but it’s a mantra we heard frequently: Hire people who are smarter than you  Interestingly, these design leaders are not just hiring smart people, hey are hiring smart people that can  carry forward the vision of the company in ways the founders may not be able to. “I hire people that are  much better than I could ever be at what they do,” says Tracey Halvorsen, President and Chief Visionary  Officer at Baltimore-based FastSpot. “I have great designers, great programmers, great project managers.  I always think that what I'm best at is helping get everyone to move along, but they're much better at  doing the stuff. They make me look good.”      It’s not just finding people who are smart but also, people who are committed to their organization’s goals  and to their craft. As Bortolussi at The Working Group points out, “The objective then is to find people  who are aligned with how we work. We enjoy our work together, we ask for excellence and we have a lot  of fun doing it. So, we look for people who are aligned with that and, who are  really good at what they  do and want a career as a master craftsman--whether that's as a developer or designer.”     But hiring people that are smarter than you isn’t enough, you also have to hire people that are different to  you. Diversity isn’t just an intellectual challenge, it’s the secret sauce of successful design firms.     Diversity of Skills    Closely related to the idea of hiring people with superior soft and hard skills is the idea that not all skilled  people should be considered equal. Hard skills are generally technical skills, like programming a  language, using a design application or proposal writing. Soft skills refer to things like communication,  presentation and conflict resolution skills. These latter skills can sometimes be harder to assess but they  are the skills that successful design companies rely on to deliver real value to their clients. Some hires are  going to make terrific individual contributions while others will take on broader management roles.  Understanding whose strengths and weaknesses fit into the jigsaw puzzle of a company’s organization is  key to a team’s success.     We asked our design leaders what they are always looking for in terms of team skills and chemistry. Jeb  Banner, CEO and co-founder of Smallbox, located in Indianapolis, likes people who push him out of his  comfort zone. “I want people that are unafraid to challenge me and others, but have the skills to do it in a  loving, kind way. I want people that are better than me. In a way, the fact that I'm not a designer and  developer hurts sometimes, because I have trouble being a collaborator on those things where I'd like to  be. But I really look for people that have talents and skills that I just look at and say, ‘Wow. I can't  imagine having this skill set’ because every time I see something they do it makes me think in a wider  way about the potential. So I always want people to broaden my thinking, not narrow it.”    Building teams around the idea of ‘who’s on the bus’ and who still needs to get on the bus came up  several times during our interviews. The bus metaphor, originally developed by the business researcher  and author Jim Collins2, appeared in the business classic Good to Great. Throughout the interviews, the                                                     2  “Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...And Others Don't” by Jim Collins, October 16, 2001    idea was regularly referred to directly or in concept and appears to resonate with the approach that many  of the leaders we met with have employed. Collin’s idea suggests that each company is like a bus about to  head off for a destination, metaphorically, its mission or purpose. Putting the right people on the bus-- seated in the right seats--and getting the wrong people off the bus, is one of the lessons from Collins’  book. “I think the biggest thing I look when I'm hiring new members is what's missing from the team,”  says Skottie O'Mahony, Creative Director for BancVue. “I look for someone who has some talent or some  background or some experience that the other people on the team can learn from.”    Critical to success in the design space, is finding people with both hard and soft skills. So much of the  design process is people-orientated, that or high-performing design firms, interfacing with clients requires  excellent writing and presentation skills. “Now that we have dedicated project managers, it's an  interesting skill-set, we want detail-oriented people who enjoy the communication, people who are able to  manage clients, manage the accounts well. It's a different skill-set than what a developer needs to have.”  Building teams of people with different skill sets raises the tide for the whole group. Diversity in  skills, backgrounds and thinking appears to encourage everyone on the team to be more empathetic and  understanding - a critical part of all design disciplines.     O'Mahony, whose product design team numbered 30 when we interviewed him, has the same holistic  view of diversity that we encountered among the majority of the design leaders. “I was looking for people  that had user research experience because we didn't have that on the team. People that had different  backgrounds--like illustration or video--because it's those areas that we would like to grow in, but are still  in their infancy. I figured if I could get people on the team that had that experience, they would help the  entire team.”    Gender is the diversity elephant in the room. There is definitely a gender bias towards more male  designers in our industry. Several leaders we spoke to were concerned about this. “We've got a very  diverse team here, but we're trying to get it more gender balanced as well, which is another challenge,”  admits The Working Group’s Bortolussi. “We're sort of becoming the classic agency; where half the  designers are women and all the developers are men. We're trying to change that, and we're trying to  encourage that change.t's ongoing.” This problem isn’t just about equal opportunity, gender diversity  brings the necessary diversity of perspective so critical for good design. Lots of initiatives to balance the  gender inequity are being undertaken. This topic is important, but too broad for the parameters of this  book. We hope to see the design industry create a good example for all other industries.                                                                                                                                                                     Grow Out of Your Shoes Not Into Them    Talent growth can be structured and planned but this does not mean you have to hire ahead of your  immediate needs. Anthony Armendariz shared his anxieties about hiring with us at the Funsize office  overlooking bustling 6th Street in Austin. “We assembled the team by being scared. Natalie  Funsize co- founder  and I were really worried about payroll. We had never been put in a situation where we had to  pay payroll and so, in the early days we were kind of scared. Everyone has always started out as a  contractor, so we made sure they fit in culturally, had the contributions we needed, the right skills. Then it  usually resulted in a relationship that we didn’t want to lose, so we began growing that way. Once we  realized we had five or six people, it became pretty clear that we needed to make long-term, full-time hire  commitments.”   It’s worth reiterating that formalizing hiring is not the same as getting ahead of company growth. Talent is  a design services firm’s highest cost. Adding team members has to be done with care but not so slowly  that it hurts productivity. This balancing act isn’t easy. Our leaders repeatedly mentioned that this dance  between adding new talent and getting the best out of their existing team was a constant struggle. The  most successful leaders used their sales pipeline to dictate their staffing needs.     Letting the future growth needs of the company dictate hiring decisions might seem like the  straightforward approach. Logic suggests that you should plan ahead for hiring and stick to that plan. In  the world of design services that’s not always the best way forward. Planning too far ahead can defy the  reality of the situation. If you don’t have the client work to pay for the growth in staff then hiring based  on a plan alone can backfire.     To punctuate this lesson is a cautionary tale from Greg Hoy, the CEO of Happy Cog: “Some of the  staffing decisions that we've made were probably a bit ambitious in terms of getting a number of people  in at one time to satisfy a need that we anticipated. Staffing up to support a pipeline that looks one way  one week and another way two weeks later, is a roll of the dice. Hopefully, you have put enough thought  behind it so it's not going to be a situation where you have too many people.” In early 2014 Happy Cog  had started experimenting with a “team-based model” and had pre-emptively hired designers and  developers to fill one of their teams. When business development expectations changed and were unable  to service this team, they had to make the tough decision to let the some of those people go. Greg remains  philosophical about those lessons and reminds us that it’s always the sales pipeline that determines your  growth.      Ultimately the design leaders we spoke to agreed that they would rather have a slightly understaffed team  than carry the overhead of underutilized people. Although it can be daunting to take on work when you  don’t have the people to deliver it, it’s easier to fill in the gaps than to deal with the stressful burden  of a  negative cash flow. This is generally true of small to medium-sized service agencies, but may not be true  of well-funded startups, larger companies or internal design teams. The latter group will often have a  longer runway of cash or alternative sources of income to support team growth in anticipation of required  work.     It’s not always about hiring the right people at the wrong time and finding the company overstaffed,  without the workflow to support these new hires. There’s danger too, in hiring the wrong people for the  wrong reasons. Each hire should contribute to the needs of the overall team and fill any skill gaps within  that team.“You should never be in a massive rush to hire the wrong person” says Jeff Kushmerek,  currently head of product at Virgin Pulse, “That person who's dying for a job because he's got mouths to  feed, you should never jump into the wrong thing, because he's going to be unhappy with me, or my style,  or unhappy with the job that's put in front of him as well.” Kushmerek goes on to say that he’s looking for  complementary skills as well, “We should always fill in those holes. You don't want people who are just  going to be a replica of yourself”.     This sentiment was almost universal in our interviews. When hiring, successful design leaders look for  people with common values but who also have skills that fill the gaps in their current teams. You might  say that the ideal candidate for these design leaders will have the similar goals, values, and  communication styles but different experiences, perspectives and skills.       Hire Coachable People Willing to Learn    Many of the successful leaders we interviewed preferred hiring younger talent and then investing time  and money in teaching them the skills they need. This wasn’t a majority opinion but it certainly was the  most popular approach. Specifically they would hire younger talent who displayed good soft skills or  showed potential. In the design industries, soft skills refer to communication and people skills. Being a  good presenter or communicator or having conflict resolutions skills appealed to our leaders far more than  only the ability to push pixels or write code.       37% of leaders interviewed said that the preferred to “hire young and train them up.”    One important consideration with this approach is that youth cannot be a substitute for maturity and  experience. There are certainly mature young designers and developers out there but it's unlikely that  every young candidate will have the level of maturity or depth of experience you seek. Furthermore,  youth often comes with the requirement of training in new skills. If you’re not set up to train relatively  inexperienced staff, this approach can slow productivity down. This was something we experienced first- hand at Fresh Tilled Soil and it was reaffirmed by Jon Lax, co-founder of Teehan+Lax, “We learned very  early on that we weren't that great at hiring junior staff and coaching them up. We were just better off  when people had a little bit more maturity. As a result, we tend to hire people who are maybe in their  third or fourth year of their career before they come here.”     As we discuss in the chapter on culture, the type of organization you create will either support hiring  practices aimed at attracting highly polished expertise or developing young rough diamonds. Hiring  younger designers, developers or project managers may appear to be a cost saving strategy but comes  with the clear disadvantage that those people won’t always have the experience you need. This requires  an investment of time to develop the missing skills and may cancel out some of the benefits of cheaper  talent.     Plucky’s Jennifer Dary warns against the tendency to think of junior talent as a cost-saving strategy. “I  completely agree that home-grown talent can be some of the most loyal and culturally dynamic members  of a team. But I also want to point out that many agencies will hire junior folks to save some money  without building the infrastructure to mentor these people. It's sink or swim. The millennial generation in  particular prefers mentorship and explicit guidance. I see it time and time again; organizations hire junior  and assign them to the busiest person at the place. Mentoring takes time, effort and bandwidth. You may  be saving money on salary, but you've got to be ready to spend a senior person's hours to invest in the hire  as well.” Dary’s caution is something we heard repeated by our design leaders. Although most agreed that  despite there being  a real cost to training and mentoring, the investment is well worth it. Design leaders  thinking that young, cheap talent is a shortcut, might ultimately pay the price further down the line.     Hiring senior designers and developers brings its own set of challenges: cost being the most obvious and,  in some cases, bad habits learned elsewhere. Many of the leaders interviewed for this book expressed  concern about hiring before getting to know the candidate. This underlines the preference successful  design leaders have for soft skills and good chemistry. Just having hard skills very often is not enough in    such a collaborative industry. A good proportion of them recommend a “try before you buy” approach,  described by Carl White, CEO and founder of Philadelphia-based design studio Think Brownstone:  “Some of the brightest people we've hired haven't had a lot of experience in this field, but they're some of  our best folks. We can tell, once you meet folks and they do some ‘ride alongs’ with us, you can see them  grabbing on to it and doing it. They've been our best.” This approach is also catching on in more formal  apprenticeship based models. The successful nature of design apprenticeships has been long known in  Europe and Japan but has only recently starting to catch on in North America. More on this topic at the  end of the chapter.     Connected to hiring coachable people is hiring talent with the motivation to succeed. “I don't know if I'm  going to get in trouble for saying this, but I love hiring immigrants, first-generation people,” says  Bortolussi. “They've got all the passion--building a career in a new country and a new place--their work  ethic is amazing, attitude is amazing, there's no self-entitlement. This is, of course, not to say that  everyone who isn't a first generation or an immigrant doesn't have that. I don't go out of my way to hire  immigrants, but I find that we have a high number of people who have recently settled in Canada, or  whose parents are settled in Canada. I don't know why that is, but we all get along really well. I think  maybe it's the nature of the industry. It's STEM-focused, there's a lot of science, the technology piece of it  tends to favor a lot of people from Asia, Southeast Asia, as well as the Middle East.” As an immigrant  myself, I support Bortolussi’s insights. Coming to the US from another country means you have a lot at  stake. Your family’s expectations, proving your worth and not wanting to let your own culture down are  just a few  of the considerations an immigrant might face. These externalities can be powerful motivators.     John Torres, Digital Design Director of America's Test Kitchen agrees with the finding the right  motivations. “I’m looking for small egos. Smart people who are passionate about the outcome, rather than  putting their stamp on the thing.”    At Fresh Tilled Soil, we took the idea that the best talent is coachable and created the Apprentice in User  Experience or AUX. In an effort to stay on top of our talent needs we developed an 110-day program  which also includes a pre-program boot camp to sift out the pretenders. The goal is to turn promising  designers and developers into UX pros through structured learning, one-on-one mentorship, and client- facing experience. Apprentices that make it through boot camp are paired with a mentor to help guide  them through the challenges. All apprentices participate in lectures and several challenges meant to  develop new skills. They also get to work on client projects for valuable real-world experience. Once they  graduate they either join our team as full-time employees or are placed with partner or client teams. These    apprenticeship programs are becoming increasingly popular in the design space. Established programs are  available at industry leadership companies like Sparkbox, Thoughtbot, Upstatement, Merge, and Detroit  Labs. Given the success of these programs, more will no doubt follow.    Growing Teams    Reflecting on Jim Collin’s bus metaphor again, leaders will need to know who stays on the bus, who gets  off and what new seats need to be filled. The threat is that hiring managers don’t simply hire people who  are just like them. Scott Baldwin, Director of User Experience Design at Yellow Pencil’s Vancouver  office reminds us that hiring ‘clones’ isn’t going to satisfy the needs of the organization, “I find in a lot of  cases, that doesn't create an interesting tension within the group. If you have people of mixed cultures, if  that makes sense or mixed personality, I think you get a more interesting and dynamic team.”    As companies grow so does the complexity of the hiring process. Firms and teams that once relied on  word-of-mouth talent referrals are now faced with new problems - job diversification and pipeline  volume. “Once we hit a certain point, somewhere after the twenties, it became painfully evident that we  needed a few more types of roles built in there,” says Dominic Bortolussi. Smaller companies will require  their people to wear multiple hats. As teams expand this becomes unsustainable. With the segmentation of  jobs, comes the necessity to hire more deliberately for those specific roles. “More project management,  more product management, an office coordinator, an office admin. Now we have an HR person. There's a  number of roles that emerged over time, and so that's how the team has shifted. So now when I'm  interviewing people,” says Bortolussi, “I'm still looking for that lifestyle and cultural fit, so that we know  people will get along, but the skill set is broadened from being just an amazing designer or helper to  having a lot of other types of skills.”    Think Brownstone’s White, prefers to work with candidates as freelancers before committing to full-time  roles admits. “ As we've gotten bigger and our process is a little more fleshed out, we probably do less of  the try-before-you-buy approach. It's going to get harder too. We have somebody right now that has no  experience in this field but who we think would be great.”    Diversity of experience means diversity of opinion and an increasing need for good chemistry within the  team. As teams grow it’s naive to think that everyone you hire will have the perfect set of skills or  consistently agree on the approach to the problems you’re solving. The key is to find good chemistry  between the team members. A well bonded team can work well together even if they have differing    opinions on the work. As discussed throughout this chapter, ensuring diversity in growing teams is key to  our leader’s success. “I hired people who have opinions about everything. So even if you’re a UI designer  you should have an opinion about UX” says John Torres. “I want to work with adults with personalities  that mesh well together. It’s my job to build teams and companies, not products and things.” This last  point by John might be the best thing we’ve heard about design leadership: The leader’s job is not to  create the designs but to create the team and culture to give birth to these designs. This is the  ultimate role for leaders in the acquisition or creation of talent.    Finding personalities that gel well together while allowing for robust debate when necessary, gives teams  the variety of perspectives so crucial in great design work. This isn’t always straightforward when a team  is already established. When old habits and dominant personalities are well established there are a  different set of challenges facing leaders. In many cases, the grooves have been well worn and changing  them is extremely hard. Over time, and without even realizing it, teams can start to look too  homogeneous. “There are managers who essentially hire themselves, and there are managers who hire  different people,” observes Yellow Pencil’s Baldwin, “And I look for a mix of both. People that diversify  and play off skill sets that I don't have, or where I can learn something from them as much as they're  learning from me. Ideally we should be working collectively as a team, and growing in that way. Whereas  I think in a lot of cases, managers will hire replicas of themselves.”    When we met with Neil McPhedran, General Manager at Grey in Vancouver, he had recently taken on the  General Manager role. He was inheriting an existing team but had the opportunity to reorganize the team.  We asked him about how he approached these challenges from both a team creation and from an ongoing  cultural point of view. “When I walked in the door there had been a few moves made with some folks  who had been here for a long time,  so we had a good core that was still here. It's taken some time to  assess opinions from other folks as to who should be and who shouldn't be here and I've definitely come  at it from a different perspective--I've got a different take on things-- since I’m on  ground here and can  feel it, versus what management in Toronto thought.”     Talented people come from many walks of life. Differences in personalities and cultures breathe new  ideas into a design conversation. The path they’ve taken to becoming designers or developers is just as  varied as the personalities. Traditional design education isn’t the only way to get to the design industry. “I  think I've come across two paths”, says Greg Storey, ex-CMO of Happy Cog, “I've worked with and I've  hired students who came out of design school where they have a lot of tactical experience, you know they  kind of paraded through applications and a little bit of history, a little bit of process, more of how-to stuff.    And then, I've come across and worked with a lot of people who just taught themselves everything they  needed to know along the way and felt more street smart. There's definitely a place for both.”    Finding Balance and Letting Go    The flipside of any talent acquisition strategy is knowing when to dinvest. John Torres, Digital Design  Director at America's Test Kitchen says, “If you’re having a lot of meetings to talk about a particular  ongoing behavior or what someone is doing wrong or how they react to others, then you are spending too  much time on that person, and they need to go.” We like this perspective on letting people go and it might  be distilled into a question design leaders can ask themselves: “If I had to hire this person all over again,  would I?” The answer to that question should give leaders a clear path to the decision to either break ties  or invest more into that team member.    Part of considering whether someone should stay or go can be gleaned from taking their perspective on  the situation. Very often, someone who you might feel is questionable is feeling the same way. They  might already be thinking about moving on and they just need to have that conversation. “It might be in  recognizing that certain people on that team just really aren't meant to be part of that team, or that group,  or that job function,” says Scott Baldwin of Yellow Pencil, “I've had a few people in my career who  clearly weren't passionate about the work that they were doing, and just didn't belong there. They're kind  of along for the ride.” Part of discovering their perspective, he goes on to say, “was encouraging them to  find the kind of thing that they were passionate about. Realizing that it wasn't here, and allowing them to  figure out their own exit, versus giving them the kick out the door.” This approach benefits both sides.  It’s less about what’s wrong and more about finding what’s right. Their performance, or lack thereof,  might be the most obvious thing to talk about, but digging a bit will reveal a deeper opportunity for both  the leader and the team member.     Letting people go isn’t always about individual performance. If the company or team is struggling and  under financial pressure, layoffs need to happen, laying off good people is one of the hardest things a  leader will have to do. The lesson here is to build a team that balances the need for high productivity with  what the organization can afford. Over-investing in a team can force layoffs when the work pipeline dries  up or the funding slows down. Hire only when you absolutely have to as XPLANE’s Dave Gray learned  the hard way, “Hiring people then having to let them go, that was a very painful thing. When you've had  layoffs in your company, it makes you a lot more conscious and conservative in terms of growth and  hiring. That morning, I was coming in to work having to lay off about half the workforce and one guy that    was going to get laid off told me that he had just bought a house. He walked in the door and was like ’I  bought a house!’ And I was like, ‘oh man’. You don't want to have that feeling. You don't want to do that  to people. So, my feeling ... my lesson is: hire slowly.”    The beneficial outcome of this hard-learned lesson, is that XPLANE has since developed a policy that  supports growth but doesn’t subject the business to stress when inevitable fluctuations happen. Gray  explains, “We have a policy at XPLANE to do about 20 to 30 percent of our work with contractors and  freelancers, because we have that kind of fluctuation in our business. We don't want to be hiring people  and letting them go and creating that kind of see-saw effect.  We want to always maintain a certain  balance of the work between full-time and part-time and freelance people that gives us a lot more  consistency and slow and steady growth.”     This was a hiring strategy used at several of the companies we interviewed but be careful, this approach  can be a legal quagmire. It’s worth noting that, in most states, state and federal law prohibits companies  from keeping on freelancers when the work they are doing is stated as a core service of the firm. For  example, if your business offers web design services, you cannot employ a freelance web designer for any  extended period of time. How do you know whether you’re bumping up against the law with your  freelancers? The golden rule is:  If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it  probably is a duck.    Apprenticeships    In Western Europe, apprenticeship programs have been around for a very long time and are integrated  into the fabric of almost all industries. The apprenticeship model is new to the North American working  culture but it seems to be catching on in the design space. Several design leaders mentioned  apprenticeship programs as a high value way to get the best talent into their organizations.     It’s important to note that an apprenticeship is not an internship. The goal of most apprenticeships is to  receive a very specific hands-on design education from the organization and eventually get promoted to a  full-time designer, developer or strategist. If recruited correctly, the apprenticeship position is held by  someone who already has a formal education and some experience in the industry. Most apprentices  would be seeking roles above the entry level positions normally serviced by internships and probationary  contracts. Positions are limited and the bar is normally high for qualification into the program so only a  few applicants will make it into these programs.       The small numbers of apprentices is made up for by the high quality of the graduates. Unlike internships  where the intern is padding their resume or just exploring options for their career, the design  apprenticeships are for those that have already committed to a career in design. Whereas internships  might be unpaid and aimed at part-time employees who are still in school, the apprenticeships are almost  always full-time paid positions for school graduates. The companies we interviewed that run  apprenticeship programs have very specific full-time roles to fill. For the programs to have the deepest  impact on the company the apprentices work side-by-side with senior team members on actual client  work.     Many design leaders also see apprenticeships as a smarter alternative to using recruiters. Outsourcing the  acquisition of talent is not only expensive but risky too. On average recruiters charge 20% of the first  year’s salary of the placed employee. Unfortunately, this is not the most expensive part of recruiting this  way. The real cost will come when recruits aren’t matched technically or culturally to the company.  Poorly matched hires can result in longer term problems like retraining, team conflicts and, possibly the  worst, having to lay the hire off and start the hiring process from scratch. When hires are done on the  basis of resumes and interviews alone design leaders are essentially placing a bet on new hires.     Bad chemistry between new and existing team members is one of the most frequently mentioned reasons  why projects run into problems. Apprenticeships reduce that risk by giving leaders several weeks, or  months, to get to know the candidates and integrate them into their teams. Furthermore, these candidates  are often on client facing teams giving leaders further insight into their soft skills in dealing with tough  situations. If those weren’t enough reasons to run an apprenticeship program, the design leaders we spoke  to also considered apprenticeships to be profit centers. Unlike interns that are very junior and performing  low-value work, apprentices are almost always working on client projects and are therefore billable.     Let’s take a closer look at how these programs work to achieve these outcomes. At Fresh Tilled Soil  we’ve been running a successful apprenticeship program for the last 3-years. The program is called AUX   Apprentice in User Experience  and it works like this:      We run three semesters per year.     Three times a year we announce through our channels that a session is accepting applications and      Applicants go through a round of phone interviews, reference checks, code audits and portfolio   receive about 25-35 applicants.   reviews.       From the initial group about 10-12 are selected to participate in a 2-week 'design thinking'   bootcamp.       The bootcamp is held on two consecutive Saturdays  each about 4-5 hrs .     Participants in the boot camp work on several challenges and the best candidates are selected   from the full-time program.      Only 4 to 5 candidates are selected from the boot camp.     The program is 16-weeks of paid full-time employment.     The AUX's time is divided into 50% training and 50% client work. In other words, they are 50%      At the end of the 15-weeks we select the top AUX graduates and offer them a full-time job. On      Graduates that don’t get offers for full-time positions at the firm will get introductions to other   billable.   average two will get offers.   companies looking for designers.     The math:      The selection process requires about 15-20 hours from a senior person to manage. That's about   $3,750-$5,000 of the program manager's time in billable terms.       Additionally, training and mentoring takes about 5 hours per week. This workload is split   between the entire team of 30 designers, developers, strategists and project managers.      When combining these indirect expenses, each cohort costs about $18,000 to manage.     Over the three semesters the annualized cost is about $54,000.     Apprentices are paid $500 week, so that works out to $8,000 per apprentice for the 16 weeks.      All in, we spend about $150K per year to get 12 exceptionally well trained designers and   That's about $96,000 per year.   developers.      We bill approximately $300K-$350K for their total time over the year.     Dollars paid to recruiters: $0     Net profit: $150K-$200K year     The benefits:      We are in control of which candidates we can invest our time and money.     We can train candidates in the areas that fit best with our client work.     Observing their soft skills  communication, presentation, conflict resolution, etc.  in challenging   team and client situations is invaluable.       We can monitor for cultural fit or personality conflicts.      It's profitable!       Graduates that don't get full-time jobs at Fresh Tilled Soil are introduced to our clients, partners   and friends. There are now over 35 graduates working at various places around the US. Several of  these placements have resulted in referral work. One referral resulted in a $30K month retainer.     Apprentice programs have some shortfalls. These programs need supervision from senior team members  throughout the year. Design leaders without a senior team to rely on for this support may struggle to find  time for these activities. Apprenticeships are also not ideal for recruiting senior or executive staff  members. Our design leaders didn’t feel this was necessarily a problem because realistically those high- level positions would come from either internal promotions or their own professional network.     For detailed information on apprentiship programs in North America visit  http:  apprentice.at      Final Word    Almost none of the companies we interviewed used external recruiters to find new talent. We found this  surprising considering the high volume of calls and emails we receive from recruiters at our own firm.  However, the majority of the companies we spoke to either have a strong reputation in the community-- which by default will attract talent--or run internal programs to develop junior talent and in these ways are  consciously nurturing the talent pipeline we have discussed in this chapter. . Our experience ,  both as  practitioners of talent development and never having relied on recruiters ourselves, is that it is possible to  grow your team without the help of external recruiters. The caveat to this is that a few of the larger  companies we interviewed used an internal recruiter or human resources person to fill that void.      Jennifer Dary leaves us with questions about retaining talent, “Companies spend a lot of money hiring  people. From the job postings to the hours spent interviewing, to the referral fees, it really adds up.  Hiring, frankly, is a boring and expensive problem to solve. What is more interesting to me is retention  and the strategies we put together in this area. Why are you losing bright people? How would your culture  need to evolve to keep them? How are you tackling career paths  or not ? These are vital questions that  need to be answered in any retention strategy.”    In our chapter on Culture, we hope to provide insight into these questions.

As a would-be 30x500 bootcamp graduate — a class that teaches people  how to create and sell their first products — these were the words that  compelled me to become a student. It was a moment that would change my  life.     Less than six months after graduating from the course, I created two  products from scratch that made more money with less customers than the  venture-backed startup I was a part of for almost five years.     This is a testament to the 30x500 approach: it forces product creators to cut  directly to the heart of why a product should exist: to find a customer.    Again, these sentiments aren't new. I was paraphrasing Peter Drucker's  words from almost 50 years ago: "the purpose of the enterprise is to create a  customer."1                                                       1 "The Practice of Management"  1993 . p 317    Talk about cutting directly to what's been causing technology's all-too- frequent product failures.     That's, in fact, one of the motivations Amy and Alex had for creating the  30x500 bootcamp: railing against the phenomenon they call "ego-first  development:" thinking that a product or idea is special just because it's  yours.     It's a fallacy that sets you up for failure. It creates an endless cycle of  throwing ideas against the wall with the hopes of finding something that  works. Hoy puts it like this:    "The core problem with so many businesses is that they're based on what the  business owner wants. They're fantasizing about being the hero: 'I'm going  to ride in on my white 'software' horse, and save these poor people.'2"    The four years that the duo have run their elite training program have  produced incredible statistics. Students who have never created a product in  their lives have gone on to make tens of thousands of dollars for themselves  in the first few months after following the 30x500 framework. Other product  rookies were generating five figures in recurring revenue after only a few  months. Their students have gone on to gross over $2 million in aggregate  sales over the bootcamp's lifespan — despite the fact that the course is  offered on an extremely-limited basis.                                                       2 http:  productpeople.tv 2014 02 07 amy-hoy     One of their core teachings is this: creating a product based primarily on  what you want focuses the product in exactly the wrong direction. By doing  so, the primary benefit becomes the fact that you've created it, instead of  what your product can do for others.    Ego-first development flies in the face of everything we've explored about  how successful products are made. That's because, as we've seen, concocting  a product idea is really an act of listening. And without knowing who you're  serving and what they need, building product is simply another form of  optimistic speculation.    But wouldn't the "Build-Measure-Learn" feedback loop that's been  popularized by the Lean Startup solve this problem? Isn't the right path to  "validate" your ideas with a "minimum viable product" through customer  interviews?     The methodology behind the 30x500 class flies directly in the face of what's  become common wisdom and all-too-frequent buzzwords in technologyland.  Notions of "customer validation," "minimum viable product," and "pivoting"  are concepts that have successfully woven themselves deep into startup  culture. But startup deaths aren't letting up3, despite the influx of capital and  talent into technology startups and the occasional high-profile successes like  Facebook, LinkedIn, and Groupon in recent years.4 Despite the flood of  cheap and eager money, 70 percent of dead technology companies were in  the internet sector.                                                     3 https:  www.cbinsights.com blog startup-death-data   4 https:  www.cbinsights.com blog billion-dollar-exit-venture-capital       The core tenet of the ready-fire-aim approach found in the Lean Startup  framework is believing that one can find customers by asking what they  want. But this is an inherently flawed notion, because doing so relies upon:    * Your ability to get your ego out of the way and to ask exactly the right  questions at the right time from the right people.  * Your potential customers being rational or aware enough to identify their  own habits, wax eloquently about what bothers them, and what would make  them happy.  * A freely-accessible pool of people who aren't going to tell you just what  you want to hear, and who don't change their habits after you interview  them.    Hillman likens this belief to the dichotomy between observing lions in the  zoo and how they behave in the wild:    "Imagine going to see the lions on display in the zoo. Now imagine seeing  the same species of lion in the wild on an African safari. Technically, you're  looking at the same animal both times. But they behave differently in the  wild than they do in captivity.    "You wouldn't make a judgement call about what MOST lions do based on a  lion in a zoo, because MOST lions aren't in zoos.5"                                                       5 https:  unicornfree.com 2014 validation-is-backwards    So, what happens when you observe your customers like you'd observe lions  on a safari? What happens when creating a new product isn't an exercise in  the "extreme uncertainty" espoused by the Lean Startup model?     You'll know what your customer's problems are. You'll know what makes  them happy and how they speak with each other. You'll know exactly what  to say and how to say it to pique their interest. And, ultimately, you'll know  how to make them want to use your product.     This approach forms the basis of 30x500's modern ethnographic approach.  Fittingly called "Sales Safari," it's a system that observes what your  customers are already doing and turns those habits into the basis for product  ideas.     Let's take a look at Sales Safari now.    Find Product Ideas with Sales Safari  Going on a Sales Safari is the process of uncovering product ideas hiding in  plain sight. It places the work of coming up with these ideas on your  potential customers, and lays a foundation for repeatable success. Based on  the observation techniques used by Lillian Gilbreth and Henry Dreyfuss,  Sales Safari is what Amy Hoy — the method's inventor — calls "net  ethnography."     "Sales Safari is 'net ethnography,' combined with some close reading and  empathy," Hoy says. "[It's] step-by-step empathizing with your customer to  understand them."      In case you've forgotten, ethnography's central premise is that you can learn  what people actually do when they're not aware that you're looking. By  observing what people do and say, you'll understand how people behave on  their terms and not on yours.     Why's this important when creating products? Because this observation  enlightens us about two really important things: the contexts in which  customers might use a product, and how that affects the relative value of  your product in their daily lives.6     "The key is you start by observing what [your customers] actually already  do," Hoy continues. "You don't try to persuade a vegetarian to buy Omaha  Steaks. You look at what they actually do in real life on the Internet. What  they read. What they share with each other. The problems they discuss. What  things that they ask help for. How they help others."    What's particularly unique about Sales Safari is that it takes place entirely  online, for a number of reasons:    * Access. You can reach almost any unique community that exists on Earth  without leaving your chair.  * Speed. Online research affords tons of conveniences like search engines,  copy and paste, and more. Doing offline research is much harder to complete  — and much harder to obtain without it being tainted by your presence.                                                     6 http:  methodsofdiscovery.net ?q=node 19    * A reliable record. When people are speaking in "meatspace," you either  have to remember what they said, scribble notes, or awkwardly record your  conversation. Online observation, though, is out there for you to read and  parse at your leisure.   * Time to analyze. Online observation provides "the ability to disassociate  what someone is saying from what you interpret them saying," says 30x500  co-teacher Alex Hillman.   * Distance. You're not physically present to influence anybody's opinions,  nor are you tempted to pull the research pitch — the act of pitching your  product while asking people what they want. "People need to not know that  you're there watching," Hillman continues. "That sounds really creepy to say  it that way, but there's a reason for it. This is professional lurking if you  want to look at it that way. You're there to watch what they do and say when  they don't know that you're there."  * Perspective. You literally have access to the entire Internet to find people  in a particular audience. You're not limited to a local Meetup or user group;  instead, you can get the full picture of an audience's pains from around the  world.     Sales Safari's intentional distance is designed to avoid the pitfalls of asking  questions and influencing your subjects. In ethnographic circles, this is  known as avoiding the "Margaret Mead problem." Her story is a cautionary  tale, and a predominant example of how being too close to the people you're  studying can distort the truth.       It's 1928. Anthropologist Margaret Mead's finished writing her book,  Coming of Age in Samoa, a study of the lives of teenage girls there: how  they came of age, what their family structures were like, and so on.      The quick-and-dirty of the Mead story is that she lived with the villagers,  asked about their lives, and listened to their stories — many of which were  later revealed to have been made up by her teenage subjects. She took these  stories at face value instead of observing their behavior.7 Years later,  anthropologist Derek Freeman returned to the village, where the now-elderly  teenage girls from Mead's study admitted to making up stories just for fun.8     That's why observing people and not asking them is at the center of creating  products that find a customer. And creating products that find customers  depend on finding their pain.    Sales Safari's designed to root out people's pain. Because if you can discern  what people's problems are, then chances are you're the one who'll be able to  solve those problems.    "People walk around trying to tune out their problems, because they don't  expect that they can solve them," says Hoy. "You have to reflect back to  them. 'Hey, this is the problem that you're having. You know, it's a big deal,  but also we can fix it together.'"                                                     7 http:  www.loc.gov exhibits mead field-samoa.html  8  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki ComingofAgeinSamoaCritiqueofMead.27smet hodologyand_conclusions      Pain and problems — revealed by observation and empathy. It's not a flashy  notion, nor is it particularly groundbreaking. But it's been at the center of  how successful products get made for over a century.     But by using modern online tools, Sales Safari can help you to start  recognizing the patterns among your audience.     "In order for someone to go on the Internet and ask a question of a group of  strangers about how to solve their problem, [it's] a very strong indicator of  the level of pain they're in," Hillman says. "Even if it seems like very little  pain to you. Like, 'oh, that's so simple. Here's how to fix it.' It's awesome that  you think that, but that's clearly not where they're coming from.     "Otherwise, they would have fixed it by now."    But how does Sales Safari help you uncover people's problems? How does it  help you to create products that will be used by more than just a few people?     Sales Safari works by observing "at scale." That means spending not just a  few hours — but dozens to hundreds of hours analyzing your audience.     This, of course, implies that you've done the work beforehand to know  where your audience or your customers hang out online. What forums,  mailing lists, link-sharing sites do they frequent? What are they writing in  customer support emails or product reviews?       Then, it's onto what Hoy says requires "close reading," a study technique  that's meant to uncover layers of meaning in text. When you close read,  you're focusing on the way the person writes, how they see the world, or  how they argue a particular point.9     But we're not doing this for literary analysis. We're doing this to understand  what people want.     And close reading, when used to understand an audience, uncovers a series  of data points that will begin to form patterns.     "You start collecting jargon, some of their specific detailed language and  words they use to describe the problem," Hillman says. "Elements and  contributions to their worldview, their deep-seated beliefs that are  unshakable. Then also the things that they talk about, they recommend. The  things that they buy._"    Doing this can be overwhelming at first. It certainly was for me when I  started studying designers as an audience. But what I found through Sales  Safari led me to create both this book and two successful products.     And, to be honest, this is hard work. Hours will tick by. Probably days,  actually. Pages upon pages of the Internet will be scoured. But it's work that  the average person doesn't do. Because it's so easy to base a product idea on                                                     9 http:  writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu pages how-do-close-reading    a handful of data points — a few coffee shop interviews, or what your  friends and family think.     But Sales Safari's power is that it's a system designed to do two things:  gather tons of data and help you analyze that data.    "[People] get one data point or they get one potential client or customer,  and they think, 'All right. This is it. I'm going to do [make this product].'  That's really a recipe for failure, Hoy says.     "You need to keep doing whatever research you're doing until it all comes  together. It'll seem fruitless up until the point where it immediately, like the  clouds will part and a ray of sunshine will burst through. People like to go  on one data point, because it doesn't take any work and because it feels  right. It's bad, though. Bad idea."    Gathering tons of data points means that you'll start to notice patterns  trickling into your notes. Eventually, you'll be able to categorize them: How  does your audience see the world? What do they dwell on? How do they  speak? What products do they use?     And, eventually, you'll start noticing the most important element of all: what  your audience's problems are, written in their own words.     So, what happens when you're able to empathize with a set of people, create  something that they want, and pitch it to them in their own words?       Sounds like you have an endless source of products ideas upon which to  build.     As Hoy puts it, "The process is essentially figure out what hurts them.  Reflect that back to them in a very empathetic, understanding way. And then  offer them assistance."     And, applied over time, Sales Safari will help you track how your audience  changes over time. Tastes evolve. Worries morph. New pains are uncovered.     It's really that simple, in theory — but only by actually putting it into  practice will you and your product reap the benefits.    Plot the Pain  It can be difficult to sift through the heft of the raw data you gather during  the course of Sales Safari research. Lots of your key insights will be tied up  in text files or on sticky notes. There's a better way to visualize the data.     Enter the Pain Matrix. No, it's not a medieval torture device —  it's a tool I  invented to help me understand my own research data, and it can be a tool  you use to help your team understand your customers better. This will help  you zero in on your customer's pain, understand what makes them happy,  and focus your product ideas.        Figure 2-1  TO COME      Note these characteristics of the Pain Matrix:    * The horizontal axis, from left to right, is where you'll track your audience's  pain. What do they mention, and how intense is it?   * The vertical axis, from bottom to top, represents the frequency of pain.  How often did you find this pain mentioned in your data?     By plotting out your research in this matrix, the four quadrants will emerge:     * Upper right: frequently-occurring, intense pain. If a product can alleviate  whatever is plaguing your audience in this quadrant, this is where you want  to be to bring the most joy to your audience.   * Lower right: infrequent, yet intense pain. Products in this category might  be nice-to-haves, surprising your audience if they were properly addressed.   * Upper left: little pinpricks of pain that occur often. Products in this  category might address smaller problems like administrative challenges,  things that people label "it is what it is," and provide a customer "little  wins."   * Lower left: little pain happening infrequently. This is something that might  appear like an opportunity while steeped in the details of your data, but  reveals itself to be a low-opportunity product to build when stepping back to  look at the bigger picture.     What tends to emerge is that the four quadrants start to fill up with very  specific kinds of pain:      * Upper right: hate, fear, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, feeling stupid,  getting stuck, wasting precious time  * Lower right: procrastination, self-doubt, guilt  * Upper left: minor irritations, dislikes  * Lower left: boredom    Doing all of this work takes time, yes, but the results you get are absolutely  indispensable. You'll have confidence that you can build something that you  know people will want. You'll discover the fastest route to building the right  solution. And you'll be immune to the idea of "failing fast" — because  failing is no longer part of the product creation process.    What Does a Product Designer Do?  "[A designer] takes pride in a skill based on experience and an alertness  sometimes interpreted as vision. He approaches every problem with a  willingness to do painstaking study and research and to perform exhaustive  experimentation. He is equipped to work intelligently with the engineer, the  architect, the physicist, the interior decorator, the colorist, and the doctor.  He must know how far to go and when to stop. He must be part engineer,  part businessman, part salesman, part public-relations man, artist, and  almost, it seems at times, Indian chief. He operates on the theory that it is  better to be right than to be original; therefore, he steers a course  somewhere between daring and caution. If the merchandise doesn't sell, the  designer has not accomplished his purpose."  Henry Dreyfuss, Designing for People      Barring any potentially politically incorrect characterizations in the  preceding quotation, Dreyfuss might as well be talking about modern digital  product design.     If we accept that a digital product's purpose is to serve a customer  and I  hope that you can after all of the history we've explored together , then a  product designer's primary job is to understand the audience they've chosen  to serve.     Once that's in place, the product designer's job to craft the product that will  best serve that audience — and, in the process, taking on a slew of  intersecting roles required to get the right product across the finish line.    But it's so easy to get caught up in the echo chamber of the self- congratulatory technology community. Product design has, in some circles,  become synonymous with the glossy, the beautiful, and the stylish.     Sales Safari helps us understand that a product has to be built with a  customer in mind, and that a product has to follow through on its promise.     In other words, product designers aren't artists, nor are they solely focused  on the aesthetic.     "What am I helping them do? What am I helping them achieve or feel or  whatever it is?," Kyle Bragger, co-founder of photography site Exposure,  describes. "For me, those two things are way bigger than, 'How does it look?  What are the features? What is the aesthetic? What does the stack look like?'    Any of the other components of that don't really matter until you've figured  out who you're building for and what it is that you're actually creating."     Everything else flows from audience and what they want. Including the  visual. It's always in service to the customer.     This isn't meant to discount the value a so-called pretty experience.  Aesthetics certainly have their place: they make a product appealing, more  trustworthy, and more of a joy to use.     But we do a disservice to product design if we place too much emphasis on  what's on the surface.     While it's constantly evolving, a product designer's role is an absorption of a  number of disciplines into a single role that used to require separate  positions.     Let's examine these merging roles now, and the characteristics they bring  with them.    Entrepreneur: identifies needs in the market and finds ways to satisfy those  needs. It can be an opportunity great or small, external or internal, obvious  or nuanced. The person who's willing to take a risk and back it up with hard  work, determination, and team building. For a product designer, this is  typically demonstrated by being able to identify opportunities to better serve  one's customer and imagining tangible solutions to carry out this vision. It  includes the ability to create and share this product vision with other teams.      Product Manager: is, [in the words of technology veteran Josh  Elman] https:  medium.com @joshelman a-product-managers-job- 63c09a43d0ec , helping "your team  and company  ship the right product to  your users." While it's different in every company, a product manager builds  a process to interpret ideas and feedback from all areas of the company —  analytics, communications, trust & safety, support, operations, legal,  international, and design  a technique at Twitter named "ACT SOLID" .  This feedback also incorporates a deep understanding of the product's  audience and the necessary research to achieve this understanding. The  product manager then uses this feedback to decide the product priorities,  driving the organization to build products in a timely manner that meet these  goals.     Typically, the role of a product manager and a designer have been separate.  Designers have been responsible for the so-called solution space, inventing  solutions to solve the problem found by product managers. Product  managers, in turn, have traditionally been responsible solely for the problem  space, uncovering customers' desires and problems and making market  projections.    These roles, though, can be difficult to separate. Product designers are not  only expected to possess the skills of problem-finding product managers, but  they're also expected to be able to implement the solution. Combining these  skills in one person can dramatically decrease time-to-market, increase a  team's coordination, and improve quality.      A product designer should now be able to talk with customers, understand  their needs and goals, and understand the market enough to design  innovative solutions. Instead of creating product specifications with the  designed solution to follow, they are able to work through the actual product  designs themselves and create solutions with a firm foot in reality.    But in larger companies, a product manager might be required to manage the  sheer volume of organizational coordination and team-building. At  Facebook, for example, product teams are comprised both of product  managers and product designers. Both have overlapping skills, and if a  product manager lacks a product designer on their team, [they're expected to  pick up the slack] http:  www.quora.com What-does-a-Product-Manager-at- Facebook-do .     Interaction Designer: envisions how people will experience a product and  brings to life refined, inspired experiences with the goal of leaving a lasting  impression. Thinks in terms of user flows and creates mockups of the user  interface. This is an individual that can internalize what a user might need at  any given stage and fight for their satisfaction. For a product designer, this  means having a strong ability to solve experience problems both within an  existing visual system and with new, extensible patterns he creates. Product  designers should also be able to document these new patterns for the team.    Visual Designer: creates beautiful concoctions of color, space, typography,  iconography and illustration to help people navigate a product. Fluent in  what comprises so-called "good design" across all types of media, including  apps, websites, advertising, and more. For a product designer, this is    typically demonstrated by having strong visual design skills that are both  original and aesthetically intuitive.     Motion Designer: understands how motion influences interaction design and  uses it to reduce confusion, lend a helping hand, and make the experience  fun. Collaborates heavily with visual and interaction designers and uses  motion to create a product personality instantly recognizable and wholly  your own. For a product designer, this is typically demonstrated by being  able to identify well-constructed motion in other products or to invent their  own original animations in prototyping tools or code.    Prototyper: using whatever tools are best for the job, a prototyper brings to  life interactions or user flows to determine what's the best experience. This  person could create a prototype with a variety of tools with varying degrees  of fidelity, including HTML & CSS, JavaScript, Adobe AfterEffects, Quartz  Composer & Origami, Framer.js, or actual code. For a product designer, this  means being able to implement one's own interaction and user flows. The  benefit of this is being able to test ideas quickly, proliferate those ideas, and  zero in on the best solution for the desired experience.    Data Analyst: understands the challenges a product intends to solve, and  provides data on product usage for informed decision making. Able to create  and interpret A B tests, synthesize large volumes of data, and makes sense of  the trends. Knows how to set up tests and what user data to gather and when.  For a product designer, this skill is typically demonstrated by a working  knowledge of which data is significant to making a decision, understanding    the impact of design decisions through data, and identifying chokepoints  where tests can be set up.    User Researcher: a champion of customers and an expert at gathering both  their insights and feedback. Designs, executes and acts on ethnographic  research and user experience evaluations to affect product strategy and  product roadmaps. Helps the organization connect with the customer in a  meaningful way. For a product designer, this skill is embodied by a deep  understanding of the domain for which the product is being built. It's an  individual who's able to translate what customers say into product vision,  individual features, and marketing language.     Psychologist: knowing that we're all human and each subject to various  influences, base instincts, and emotional draws, a user psychologist brings a  larger human perspective to the task of creating enjoyable, emotionally- engaging experiences. Has a basic understanding of cognitive psychology,  heuristics, empirical research, and empathy. For a product designer, this  means being able to understand customer behaviors and the motivations  behind them. It then provides the motivations to act on certain product  features — creating habit-forming products by knowing what delights a  human being in a particular context.     Copywriter: a person who's able to craft appealing, contextual, and easily- understood copy to a specific audience. They have an excellent vocabulary  and exercise proper grammar. For a product designer, this means balancing  clarity with the personality of the product being built. It also means fighting  for properly-formed sentences.       Project Manager: has the responsibility of driving a project to meet its stated  goals. It requires balancing the four pillars of the project management  superfecta: time, cost, quality, and scope. For a product designer, this is an  essential part of the role and a constant dance between engineering and the  needs of the business. What features are essential? What are nice-to-haves?  What if everything seems essential — how do you choose what to trade to  meet a deadline? Product designers must have the skills to navigate these  muddying questions and deliver a satisfying product.     Product Marketer: is responsible for being the link between the product and  its intended audience. This can include internal groups like sales or public  relations, as well as clients, customers, and partners. They help the product  organization understand what should be built and keeps track of how  customers and the market as a whole react to new product launches. Before  the product is built, product marketers will perform market research to help  determine where new product development should head. After the product is  built, they take care of launch marketing and all relevant materials required  to sell it. A product designer embodies this role when they work with  marketing to make sure that the product's promise matches with the public  story. They'll determine what the release plan should be, and works with  engineering through the launch process to fix problems and communicate  what's happening with both the organization and the outside world.    Customer Support Representative and Community Manager: these are the  people on the front lines, who regularly take the brunt of problems when  things go wrong. And in the rare event of praise, they identify the parts of a    product that are doing its job. They're advocates for customers having  problems, and exude the product's and the brand's promise through their  interactions. A product designer knows how to identify and categorize this  messy feedback, from catastrophic to nice-to-haves. They'll be a bridge  between Support and Engineering, and might even be a fixture in the  community, serving as a nexus for their customer's candid feedback.    These have traditionally each been separate roles in an organization. Many  of them still are, and many will continue to be for some time. But they each  have a role in the toolset of a product designer.     It's obviously impossible, though, for a product designer to be an expert in  every one of these fields. The role lives at the nexus of all of them.  Implementing a product requires knowledge and practice of each of these  disciplines.     Typically, though, a person in this role tends to specialize in a set of these  skills. It happens to product designers much like it happens to characters in  role-playing games, or RPGs. RPGs typically start new games by requiring  players to build custom characters. Players are asked to choose from the start  to choose characters specializing in a particular "class" of skills, such as a  bounty hunter, a hacker, or a soldier. Each class specialization brings Over  the course of the game's storyline, the player is given the opportunity to  "level up" their skills, and can choose to either be a well-rounded character  or one that has deep experience in a few particular skills.      Just because the words "product designer" may not be in your job title  doesn't mean that it's not your role. Titles like "Product Manager & Lead  Designer," "Product Owner" or even the classic "Product Manager" might  require you to employ product design-like thinking and skills.     But it all goes back to serving the customer. That's why a product exists.     So how do you sift through the research you've gathered? How do you know  where to point your product?     Let's take a look at the Pain Matrix, a tool I invented for analyzing my own  research data.    Shareable Notes  * Product design is a process that starts and ends with completely  understanding your audience. This takes painstaking firsthand research  before you even start building a product.  * Sales Safari is a modern approach to ethnography. It's the process of  choosing an audience, seeing where they hang out online, and lurking in  these communities to analyze their wants and needs.   * You can use the Pain Matrix to make sense of your original research by  plotting your data.  * A product designer is a role that exists at the nexus of a slew of skills:  anthropologist, product manager, copywriter, interaction designer, and more.  It's a reflection of how important technology has become to our culture.    Do This Now    If you accept that product design starts and ends with an intimate  understanding of how you can serve a customer, then identify the following:    * Who is the customer for which your product exists?   * Where do these people congregate online?   * What do you understand about them? What can you learn about them by  reading their forum posts, App Store reviews, or support emails?   * Plot their pains on the Pain Matrix. Compare it to the problems your  product is currently tackling. How do they match up? What has your product  been missing?    Interview: Amy Hoy & Alex Hillman  Amy Hoy and Alex Hillman are the co-creators of the 30x500 Bootcamp, a  course that teaches students how to sell products that people want to buy. At  the core of the course is a technique Hoy invented called "Sales Safari," a  process rooted in ethnographic observation. 30x500 students have grossed  $2 million in product sales within the past two years.10    Scott: What is 30x500? And what is Sales Safari?    Amy: So 30x500 is Alex and my class for creative people. They can learn to  create and sell their first products, because working and doing creative stuff  for somebody else for hire, it's very different than selling directly. You're  insulated from the market realities. You don't understand quite what people  want, except your boss.                                                      10 http:  courses.30x500.com      It's very difficult to go from school and job and then freelance to create a  product. A lot of people fail, because they don't understand how different it  is. So our class gives them those skills that they can go and launch  something and make money.    Alex: And Sales Safari really started as just one of the components of that  class. When we first set out to create it, and the first version was actually  called "the Year of Hustle."     What was interesting when we started teaching that version of the class,  which is everything leading up to launch, a bunch of the components of that  were...we didn't think they were all that high level, but we learned over time  just through teaching that things like "take notes" and "go do research on  your audience" aren't really specific enough.     So Sales Safari's really become the heart of the 30x500 class. Arguably, the  majority of the lessons themselves, the exercises are tied directly to it, when  originally, it was just one step of many.    Amy: I don't know if it was so much one step of many as that we would say  things like "go study," "go read what your audience is writing, study it and  make notes. And use that." People don't understand how to go study, read or  make notes.    A lot of college educated people, none of that makes sense at all.      Alex: It's step-by-step. Every component is a "here's not just what to do," but  specifically how to do it. Here's the results that you get. And here's to know  whether or not you're doing it right, because you're going to use those results  in the next component. Things like that.    Amy: What is really is, Sales Safari is "net ethnography," combined with  some close reading and empathy. Like step by step empathizing with your  customer to understand them.     Alex: Also sort of a built in feedback loop. Once you start applying those  Sales Safari data, you're collecting categories of notes, things like the pain  that you notice in people. Not just the pains, like what the problem is, but  also how they describe it.     You start collecting jargon, some of their specific detailed language and  words they use to describe the problem. Elements and contributions to their  worldview, their deep-seated beliefs that are unshakable. Then also the  things that they talk about, they recommend. The things that they buy.    All these things where the individual data points can be valuable, but the  goal of Sales Safari is to have a systematic and repeatable approach, so you  can collect a ton of it. A ton of data, because without a ton of data, you can't  find the patterns. Without patterns, you can't make smart decisions about the  business.    Amy: Yeah, people who go and they, especially designers, developers,  writers, they think, "I'm going to make a product." They get one data point    or they get one potential client or customer, and they think, "All right. This  is it. I'm going to do it." That's really a recipe for failure.     You need to keep doing whatever research you're doing until it all comes  together. It'll seem fruitless up until the point where it immediately, like the  clouds will part and a ray of sunshine will burst through. Where it will  change [inaudible 00:05:07] thing and they'll go, "Of course, this is what I  should be doing."     People like to go on one data point, because it doesn't take any work and  because it feels right. It's bad, though. Bad idea.    Scott: What was the impetus behind doing this? What led you on this path to  now?    Amy: It started when I was very young. I read like every book in the library  when I was a kid. I read everything. One of the books that really made a  difference in my life was "People Watching" by Desmond Morris. And then  his related books, like "Baby Watching" and "Pack Watching." That gave  me very, very early on the idea that you can understand people and creatures  by observing them.     So, thanks, Desmond Morris!     And later on I learned about ethnography, which is, of course, what  Desmond Morris was doing. Then just later on when I started doing  freelance and business and stuff, it just made sense for me to focus on what    were people doing and how can I get in front of them? So Sales Safari, it's  something that I've been doing sort of naturally since I was a teenager. Then  I started trying to teach it to my friends, because as someone who is really  well-connected in the Ruby on Rails and Peachtree worlds, I just watched  my friends fail and fail and fail.     I'm like, "Um, you don't need to be failing."    When we launched, my husband and I launched Freckle, a software as a  service in 2008. Software as a service grows really slowly in terms of  revenue. In 2010, I decided I had to quit consulting, because it was making  me want to murder everyone. So like how can I make some money? We had  shipped JavaScript workshops, which is like 50 grand at that point.     I decided that one of the most valuable things I could teach was the business  stuff. Because we launched workshops. We'd launched e-books. We've  launched software as a service, which was growing nicely. It's just slow. I  sold so many big consulting contracts to difficult clients and got them to do  what I wanted. I clearly had a skill that people lacked and I wanted to share  it with them.    That was the very first Year of Hustle. I was like, "Hey, Alex. You want to  help me?" Because I knew Alex has a lot of the most important worldviews  in common.      Alex: My background...Amy and I had some similarities in the fact that  we've done the employment track. We've done the freelancing consultant  track.    Amy: And then we did the impossible.    [laughter]    Amy: Separately.    Alex: As it were. What's interesting is...or it's two things. One was Amy and  I were friends for a number of years before we started working together, so  this was not a business partnership forged out of necessity.    It was more of a "Hey, we do have a common interest and a common set of  skills in terms of being able to connect with an audience and help them do  something that's important to them." That's what made us successful as both  employees and freelancers, honestly. The thing that was always my angle as  a freelancer was when everyone was out there selling their code, I was  actually getting to know the business that I was trying to serve and say,  "Here's what I think will actually make the work you're about to pay me to  do pay for itself in a multiple." And wrote it. Nobody does that.    Amy: It's partially nobody does it, because they just think like a cog at all  times. But also I found one of the basic reasons I hated consulting was the  clients really don't...I mean, they say they want that, but they don't really.    They ignore you. They hire you and they pay you, but then they ignore what  you say.    Alex: The move to Amy and I working together on this came from the same  frustration of both having created successful businesses beyond our  freelance. Amy had been able to launch Freckle. It was young, growing at  the time.     I had Indy Hall. Also young and growing at the time. And saying, "How is it  that we've created these things and seemed to have dodged all of these  bullets that take so many other people out. What can we share from what we  have learned to help people avoid the failure rather than just lean into it and  accept it and say that these lessons are necessary battle scars in order to be  successful? That's ridiculous.    Amy: Yeah. We share our idea that some X can't be taught, whatever it is. X  can't be taught. It's done by people who are crappy teachers.    Alex: Amen.    Amy: Alex, you didn't explain what Indy Hall was to the [readers].    Alex: Sure. Indy Hall is a coworking community and space. We're one of the  first in the world, which puts me in a distinct position to say that there  legitimately were not people doing what we did when we started. I had to  learn a lot from outside influences and things like that to figure out how to  make Indy Hall work.      For those of you who know about coworking and maybe have visited a  coworking space, one thing that I'll urge you to do next time you set foot in a  coworking space is look for one thing in particular and that's whether or not  people in that coworking space are actually interacting with each other. Are  they talking to each other? Do they walk up and say "hello" to their  neighbors and things like that? Or do they walk in. The drop down their  computer and they put in their headphones and not talk to anybody?     One of the things that sets Indy Hall apart and the thing that I think we work  the hardest at since the very beginning is we're not so much a place to work,  although absolutely, I think one of the best places to work, we're a place to  meet people who you wouldn't otherwise meet. Really a community more  than anything else. More of a club and a clubhouse.    And eight years later, we're still growing strong and evolving and doing all  sorts of things. But the interesting thing about my experience in building  Indy Hall and community building is the practice that we both do at Indy  Hall and we teach other coworking spaces and things like that.     It's got a lot in common with Sales Safari. That's not something that I talk  about a whole lot. But its a lot of the same components of observation at  scale, pattern watching, close listening, building empathy, and then, I guess,  the part that's a little bit different from 30x500 in many ways and a lot of the  businesses that 30x500 helped people create is when you create a product  business, generally speaking your customers are not aware of each other.  They're not super aware of each other.       They may be aware of them from testimonials or they may bump into each  other. Even if you've got a mailing list or something, a discussion list or  support forum or things like that, but Indy Hall's this kind of bizarre business  where the customers are extremely aware of each other to the point where  the majority of the value that you get as a paying member of Indy Hall is  actually coming from other members.    Which means as a business owner, my senses for listening and  understanding people where they actually are needs to be very, very good.  Otherwise, we react to what we hear versus what we see and make bad  decisions that a lot of other shared work spaces do.    Amy: What Alex didn't say is that Indy Hall and there's where Alex is sort of  like the "godfather" of coworking communities, because so many of them  have made the same stupid mistakes and then had to shut down because they  didn't serve and focus on their customers first. They instead focused on the  extraneous baubles, like fancy desks and a fancy space.    Then they were like, "Well, how do I fill this space?" Which if you spend  any time in entrepreneur forums, you know people make things. They're  like, "Well, how do I get people to buy it?" It's the same thing.     The same problem people have in Indy Hall. Alex did it the opposite way,  which is why he and I are such a natural fit.      Alex: If you think about starting a business with venture capital or really any  stage of funding before there's money coming from customers, what happens  is you set a scale. You pre-dictate a scale that the business needs to be in  order to be successful. You have more venture capital, you take on at really  even a "favorable" rate or valuation, that transaction dictates a necessity for  growth. That's what people say makes a startup a startup.    But it changes the kind of decisions that you make and who you serve.  Instead of serving the customers, you serve the size of the container that you  created for that business to continue to fill and do by hook or by crook.  Unfortunately too many people lean towards crook in order to make it work  or you fail.    And so many businesses fail at a totally reasonable profitable scale, because  they never are able to hit that imaginary bounding box.    Amy: They're over-leveraged from day one.    Alex: If you look at a coworking space as a physical manifestation of the  exact same thing. If you start with a 20,000 square foot space, now having to  have memberships to support a 20,000 square foot space and then some  before you can ever consider yourself successful.    We take the inverse approach and teach the inverse approach, which is have  members before you even have the overhead of a space. Let the membership  and its growth and its needs and its way of supporting each other dictate the    size and other attributes that are far more important than the size of the space  itself.    Scott: How did you apply the rough principles of Sales Safari to building an  offline business?    Alex: For my short answer, and then I'll want to hand it over to Amy, is that  not much changes with the exception that everything slows down. You lose  a bunch of really valuable tools, like "search" and "copy paste." You rely on  your ears and your brain.     The one thing that I tuned that...I mean, this is expert level Safari in so many  ways, is the ability to disassociate what someone is saying from what you  interpret them saying. And remember what they actually said, not what you  think they said.     That's something that's much easier to do online when it's written, because  you can literally copy and paste what they said. When you're talking to  people, man is that hard.    So you're at a bunch of disadvantages to try and do this offline and it's slow.  But I'm curious what Amy has to say about this.    Amy: The other issue, we don't need to invent in person Safari, because  ethnography and whatnot have already been invented. Safari was my  invention to take those into Internet form.      When you're in person, it can be also...most people cannot observe while  they're engaging. It's very difficult. Not only difficult to disassociate, but  literally, you have to have two parallel running processes in your brain, and  they both have to be working at full speed. Very few people can do that. I  think even with training, very few people can do that.    Two, if you're in a local user group, for example, and you're like, "Oh, they  get these people that have these problems." And this user group, assuming  even that's accurate, you then think that, "Well, they all must be this way  across the entire world. All the different user groups, every "Rubyist" must  have this problem.     That could be so untrue. You have a local maximum in a lot of ways. Like  literally local and you might have just reached the peak of what's local and it  may not be anywhere else the same.    Alex: Which isn't inherently a bad thing, but it's a limitation you need to be  really, really aware of.    Amy: Right. When you're serving an actually local market, which is what  [inaudible 00:19:02] does, it works so much better, because it doesn't really  matter if people in Tucson, Arizona have the same concerns about working  alone as a freelancer, because they're not going to join Indy Hall.    If you serve a local market, then local Safari is the absolute best thing you  can do.      But on the other hand, people then take that kind of thing, if I say that kind  of thing, then they think, "Oh, I'm going to go to my salon and see what  struggles they have." But that doesn't show you the full picture.     I cannot tell you how many friends and early on students before we learned  to discourage them, went and said, "All right. Well, my local bar, restaurant,  salon has this stacked scheduling problem. I'm going to make software for  it." They think they identified a problem that they were going to solve, but  they didn't understand salons at all. They watch them misuse pieces of paper  to do this rough scheduling, but they didn't understand that these people  never buy software, ever. If they bought software, they wouldn't have this  problem to start with.    We have seen staff scheduling issue for local businesses come up four or  five times over the past few years. It's always a failure, because you can  observe someone doing a task and not understand the bigger context. And  the way that you understand a greater context is long term observation, like  many different intervals.    Alex: Then the other part to that is if you ask them to show how they use it,  you're instantly at a disadvantage, because they know you're watching over  their shoulder. That instantly creates changes, even if they're micro-changes  in how they use it, because they're trying to show you something, instead of  doing what they normally do in order for you to observe.     There's an element to Sales Safari where there's a very intentional distance  and a lack of participation. People need to not know that you're there    watching. That sounds really creepy to say it that way, but the reason for it.  This is professional lurking if you want to look at it that way. You're there to  watch what they do and say when they don't know that you're there.     Amy: It's not that they're doing it in private. It's a public forum and mailing  list and such, but they aren't performing for you.    Alex: Exactly. It's what do they say unprompted?    Amy: In ethnography, I consider this a Margaret Mead problem, right?  Margaret Mead was this famous anthropologist who screwed up big time,  because she went to these remote villages and she asked the villagers, and  especially the teenaged girls what their lives were like. And then she came  back with these insanely sensationalized tales of crazy sex lives and  everything. They were just totally putting her on.    It wasn't true. In people studying circles, Margaret Mead is a cautionary tale.  In fact, she's probably the cautionary tale, because she took the word of her  subjects instead of observing what actually went on. Very gullible. And you  don't want to become a martyr.    Scott: So why do, in your experience, why do people misrepresent or  sometimes lie or sometimes just say something to get you off their back?  Why is it that asking people isn't reliable?    Amy: I don't think it's usually...I think it's rarely on purpose. I think it's  rarely on purpose. People don't understand what they do all day. They don't    pay attention to what they do all day. As a designer, I can tell you. It's just  absolutely fact, because if I explain all these problems with enough software  people, like, "Oh, but it's not so bad! Oh, that's just email or whatever."     I'm like, "Well, what about if it looked like this?" They're like, "Oh, I never  thought of that. I never thought that maybe I should have a people view that  will show the files Bob sent me, so I don't have to search for 'Bob.' And then  click every email with that."    Alex: To Amy's point, there's a numbness to some pains. But the other side  of it is, it's people really ultimately train themselves to not think about it or  to think about it in a certain and specific way. Or they've heard a certain  thing that they think they're supposed to say.    Again, it's not an intentional act of deception. That's extremely rare. It's  more that you're relying on them to be reliable. That's statistically, that's not  going to be the case.     They're not aware. If they were so aware of their problem, there's a good  chance the problem would be solved by now.      Amy: That's why every programmer makes their own tools, and they're all  terrible. I'm a programmer. You all know what I'm talking about.    The other thing. If there's research that shows this, experts don't understand  how they do what they do. They can't verbalize it.      When you start observing it, they start trying to explain it while they do it.  Their performance worsens a lot.     Scott: I also remember the example you gave in a talk a while ago of the  Walkman focus group.    Amy: Oh, yeah.    Scott: Where they said, "We want yellow." And then they all picked up  black.    Amy: Yeah. All the kids were asked by Sony, "Which one is cooler? Which  one would you want to buy? The cool sporty yellow Walkman — I think it  was Discman — or the black one?" And then they were like, "Thanks for  doing our focus group. Here's two tables worth of Walkmen. Pick the one  you want." And they almost all picked black.    People's vision of themselves is different than how they actually are. That's  humanity for you.    Alex: And also, this is something I've learned through Indy Hall is that  people rarely -- this is bizarre -- people so rarely act in their own best  interest. It's really bizarre.       It's not that they are intentionally self-sabotaging. It's that if there are habits  at play, that they generally aren't aware of that habit. They will simply revert  to the habit.     The example I can give you is that people choose to work in a coworking  space generally because they don't want to be by themselves. Otherwise,  they could stay at home, right?    Yet so often, given the opportunity, if they come into a coworking space, the  first place that they will choose to sit is by themselves. I like to think of it,  it's like when you get into an elevator by yourself, you stand in the center.  The second another person walks in the elevator, you both go the opposite  corners.    It's a personal bubble thing or I'm used to sitting by myself, so I think I'm  going to sit by myself.     It takes an outside influence, which in the case of a coworking space is me  and my team, doing choice architecture and design to help our members, our  paying customers get what they actually came there to get. Because if they  are left to their own devices, often they won't.    Scott: That's fascinating. Do you find that peer pressure plays a role as well?  Is it like a so-called societal norm in the context of where they're at? Or is it  just, "Hey, I'm awkward being social, but yeah, I want to be. I don't want to  be by myself."      Alex: I think it depends. I'll say all this. There's not a right or a wrong way to  work in coworking space.     You work however you're most productive. But what we know is the people  who get the most value generally do a handful of certain things. That comes  from observation.    If we can help people choose those things for themselves, that's one of the  other elements that we teach in Sales Safari. One of the Sales Safari  derivatives is our copy writing techniques, which are designed to be  persuasive. It's not about getting somebody to do something they wouldn't  already do.    Amy: No, never.    Alex: It's getting them to make a choice that is in their best interest. If it's not  in their best interest, it doesn't work.    That's the beautiful thing about it. It's not persuasion for the sake of getting  people to do something detrimental. You can't plant a seed in  someone's...you can't plant an idea in someone's head and simply have them  do something that is against their best interest. If you can, it's evil. But that's  not what we're setting out to do.    Amy: But most people aren't that good.    Alex: Yes. That's just it. You have to be very, very good at it.      Amy: Really, really hard.    Alex: In order for that to be effective. And most people just aren't that good.    Amy: Thank God.    Alex: Master manipulators.    Alex: It's true. But it comes down to, when you think about sales and copy  writing, writing persuasively, even if it's not a sale in terms of money  changing hands, but getting somebody to do something. Writing an email  that people will read. Writing a blog headline that will get somebody to read  the rest of the article, you have to think about why reading the article is in  that person's best interest. And then show that to them.    Because they're not going to do it on their own.    Amy: It's this idea that people walk around looking for solutions to their  problems. No. People walk around trying to tune out their problems, because  they don't expect that they can solve them. You have to reflect back to them.  "Hey, this is the problem that you're having. You know, it's a big deal, but  also we can fix it together."    That is the heart of my copywriting technique.      Scott: That's a good segue. What's the process that helps you understand  what would make someone read that email, use this product, read that blog  post?    Amy: The key is you start by observing what they actually already do. You  don't try to persuade a vegetarian to buy Omaha Steaks. You look at what  they actually do in real life on the Internet. What they read. What they share  with each other. The problems they discuss. What things that they ask help  for. How they help others.     And then you get in there with something that already fits their behavior and  their worldview. If people don't watch videos or they exclusively watch  videos or you find they pay more for videos, then you'll want to consider  giving them videos.    The process is essentially figure out what hurts them. Reflect that back to  them in a very empathetic, understanding way. And then offer them  assistance.    So you don't say, "Hey, I can help you with that!" Say, "What if you didn't  have to restart Skype five times during your podcast?"    Scott: That would help.    Amy: Great. Yeah. Or just the little tool we started using the other day called  "Line In." So you can actually hear yourself on your own monitor while  you're recording stuff.      Scott: Oh, imagine that.    Amy: Yeah. It's like you have to start recording and then stop recording and  then reopen it and listen to it, what you just recorded, to be sure that  everything's correct. Why do you have to take all these steps?    So what if you didn't have to take all these steps? What if you could do it  simultaneously? Hey, here's the app!    Alex: By the way, it was incredibly hard to find the solution to that problem.  I was someone who was looking for it. This is a great illustration of what  Amy was talking about before. I knew the problem that I had. I knew that I  wanted to solve it.     What I didn't know was how to describe in the way that the person who had  created it was marketing the product was describing it.     Amy: They didn't do as good a job as I did just right now.    Alex: Right, exactly. If they had, I would have typed a couple things into  Google and boom! They would have popped right up. There's a natural SEO  to this as well. If I'm trying to guess what way would a product maker  describe their product in order to find it, you're making me do double the  work. That's why I'm never going to find you.       Versus let me type in the problem that I have in the way that I would already  describe it, and poof! There you are.    Scott: What I love about Sales Safari is that it takes advantage of the fact  that we're now at a time where all this stuff takes place online for the most  part. There are some communities that don't hang out in forums or link  sharing sites or Reddit or whatever, but it takes advantage of the fact that,  hey, by and large, the vocal members of some community are talking about  the problems they have.    Alex: This is the thing to put all of that in perspective. I think you're totally  right. Is that in order for someone to go on the Internet and ask a question of  a group of strangers about how to solve their problem is a very strong  indicator of the level of pain they're in. Even if it seems like very little pain  to you. Like, "Oh, that's so simple. Here's how to fix it." It's awesome that  you think that, but that's clearly not where they're coming from.     Otherwise, they would have fixed it by now.    So keep that in mind, that in order for people to post a problem they're  having for help to an Internet of strangers, that's a clue right there.    Amy: Huge clue. Yeah.    For example, my husband Thomas is like a lot of people. He just kind of  goes along. Like, "Why are you hanging socks on the drying rack this way?    If you hang them this way, they'll dry faster." He's like, "I've been hanging  socks this way for 30 years. I don't care."    So you can't really help Thomas, no matter how much he needs the help in  these areas, things he doesn't care about. But if he were on a forum asking  how to maximize his hang dry time, then you would know it was time to sell  him one of those crazy octopus hanger things that they sell in places where  they don't have dryers.    That was a weird example.    Scott: No. Sock drying is a perfectly legit example.    Amy: The struggle is real.    Interviewer: I'd love to hear what your thoughts are on the so-called Lean  Startup mentality, that's been permeating startups everywhere. It's something  that people kind of take it as blind faith these days. Any thoughts on that?    Alex: I think it's important to think about the Lean Startup, before we even  get into what it is and why it doesn't work, talk about the problem it tries to  solve. Right? The problem it tries to solve in theory is not very different  from the problem we're trying to solve, which is ship something that people  actually value.      And to avoid wasting time and effort and money and other finite resources  on getting there...It's advice being given at the level where you're just  tweaking an already broken decision. An already broken system.    Where the Lean Startup really leads with the genius idea that came from  inside of you, and says, "Here's how you will take my Lean Startup magic  fairy wand and if you tap it on the right people's shoulders in the right  direction, you'll magically make a sale."    Scott: That was beautiful.    Alex: You like that?    [laughter]    Amy: Please say "fairy wand" again!    Alex: Fairy wand.    [laughter]    Alex: But that's how I've been describing 30x500 as the antidote to that  feeling of tapping people on the shoulder with your "do you want this  wand?"    [laughter]      Alex: It's getting weirder, isn't it?    And avoiding that entirely. So Amy, do you want to pick up and run from  there? How's that for a set up, by the way?    Amy: Basically, Lean Startup is Cinderella. Cinderella is going to keep  scrubbing different stoves until someone comes and nominates her to be a  magical princess.    Alex: It's not that Lean Startup can't work. It's that it works on...it's like,  what's the term in programming? Eventual consistency. Lean Startup can  work given an infinite amount of resources and time to maybe finally make a  match.    Amy: Okay. A thousand monkeys typewriters Shakespeare.    Alex: Right.    Amy: Well, I think the key is "garbage in, garbage out." If you have  something that's already fundamentally good, then lean startup can help,  because you're just refining what's already good. But most people don't have  something that's already fundamentally sound to start with.    Alex: There is no way for them to know whether or not they do.     Amy: Correct.       Alex: Lean doesn't teach you that.    Amy: Throw stuff at the wall until something sticks, which is basically the  lean startup approach. With lean, if you actually read the book "Lean  Startup," it's really vague.    It doesn't actually tell you, "Do this, do this, do this." It's more of a pastiche,  which is fine. People act as if it's a set of instructions, which it's not, which  leads to all the confusion and difference in opinion that you find people  infighting about all the time in the Lean forums.    The think about Lean Startup is that it's inspired by the Toyota way and lean  manufacturing, which is very clear. Some of the best parts of the book are  the quotes from the Toyota way.    No one starts an assembly line like, "Well, let's see what comes out the end.  If we don't like it, we'll change it."     Which is what Lean Startup does. It's like, "We're going to make something.  If it doesn't work, we'll change it." That's not how anyone makes cars and  that's not how anyone ever made cars. By the time they get to lean  manufacturing, the what is a known quantity. An established function. Then  you just improve the manufacturing itself.    I'm not actually sure how the Lean Startup came about. It doesn't logic out to  me, if "logic" can be a verb.      Scott: It is now.    Amy: Whereas we are like, "What makes something people want to buy?"  And then what do people want to buy? Because you cannot make something  people want without understanding what people want or being very lucky.  Luck is not a business plan.    Alex: It's not that that's not how it happens. It's unlikely that you can recreate  that.    Here's the thing. There's a fundamental difference between the business  that's willing to run around with hopefulness, that Cinderella story that we're  talking about before, and predictable, repeatable results.    Predictable, repeatable results means you can work with consistency. It  means that you can work on a schedule. If you've got limited time. You're  trying to do this on the side or you've got health issues or you've got kids  and a family. And you don't want to give things up. The lean approach,  again, it will swell to fill the amount of time and resources you give it. You  can keep doing it into infinity.    Whereas with consistent repeatable results, you can do it with finite amounts  of time and know that you'll get there.    It's a beautiful thing, because it actually scales, also. Is you know that when  you do it and it works, you can keep doing it. You can do it more and get    better at it. You can put more in and get more out. It's an actual process  versus this very vague, fuzzy, open to interpretation thing that is lean.    Scott: What made you build Sales Safari on the pains and not the joys that  people mention?    Amy: Because joy is much more personal and also a lot of cultural groups,  and I don't mean like ethnic or country cultures, but industry cultures don't  talk about what's awesome. Or, if they do, it's sort of disingenuous, how  everything's awesome.    30x500 focuses on providing business value. And business value always  comes from something that is a waste to start with or a lack.    So, Freckle Time Tracking, my app, may create pockets of joy, which I think  is awesome. But the most important thing that it does is serve a business  need while not being terrible. Freckle is actually very pleasant to use, but  just saying it's actually fun to use...I mean, you could apply that to anything.  It would be meaningless.     This thing, it's time tracking that you'll actually use because it's pleasurable.  That time tracking is the key part here, if that makes sense.    There was this scene in this book called Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and  Neil Gaiman. Have you read it?    Scott: I have not, but it's on my Amazon wish list.      Amy: It's really good. You should read it now! It's fantastic.    One of the main characters is Demon Crowley. He's sort of gone native in  the world. He wants to be human, basically, and live as human. The demon's  job is to create evil, right? They have this demon meeting. Demon middle  management affair.     And these other demons are like, "I can get a priest to commit blah, blah,  blah." And "I tempted a man to kick his dog." Blah, blah, blah. And  Crowley's like, "Well, you guys are not thinking big enough. Those are  individual acts that lead to strong acts of evil, but what I did was I invented  the M-25 motorway. And people drive around it and curse it. Thousands of  them every single day."    It's especially funny, because British highways are terrible.     But the idea that looks like the low level accretion of evil, thousands of  times a day, I like to try to create the opposite. Think how many horrible  hours each day are burned using Microsoft Word.    Or enterprise contracting software. The thing is, if you just say, "I'm going  to create joy," you'd be like, "Here's a cup of ice cream!" Doesn't actually  tell you where to go. People like kitties. They like kitties. They like ice  cream. They like jazz music, but those are harder things to sell unless they're  in the need for them.      Whereas if you say, "You struggle with this problem every day. Imagine if it  was actually positive interaction instead?" Then you actually get people  listening, so that they're in the mood for ice cream, they're not going to buy  ice cream. If you can't stimulate demand for it easily, but if you work with  something that they're suffering with, then you have a conversation opener.    Scott: I love that characterization. You have to be in the mood for these  things. I've never heard it put like that before. I think that's really powerful.    Amy: Stimulating demand is difficult. It can be difficult.    Alex: This all comes back to, just to sort of round out Amy's point, it's very  easy and also ineffective to spend a lot of time trying to convince somebody  else that they want something versus meeting somebody where they are in  the moment where they want it.    Not only are you able to serve them, but they get this feeling of "magic mind  reading-ness," which is complicated concatenation of words. The idea being  not only are you able to solve their problem, but they get this feeling, in  addition to the joy of having their problem solved, think about that elation  that you feel when it's like, "Finally, somebody gets me. Gets my problem.  And by the way, found a way to solve it."     And even if it's not perfect, even if it's got shortcomings, which by the way,  it will. It always does. That doesn't matter, because they feel "felt." They feel  like you get them, which instantly instills some trust, which adds to their  willingness and likelihood of buying. People buy...that's another factor in the    30x500 process is the difference between selling to clients as a freelancer or  even selling yourself to an employer where you've only got to convince one  person is you can get to know them and figure out what you need to tell  them in order to get them to hire you or give you a raise.    When you're selling products, you're not allowed to be in the room for every  sale. So you need new mechanisms for building trust.    And meeting people where they are, helping them genuinely through e- bombs and then through a pitch that says, "I get you. I get your problem.  This is your problem, right?" "Yeah, that is my problem. You've described it  the way I described it. Are you reading my mind?"     And then you show them how things could be better. They're like, "Yeah,  that's actually what I want. That ratchets up the trust. They believe that you  get them.    Amy: Because you do.    Alex: Because you do.    Of course, this only works if you actually follow through. Amy likes to talk  about...we study infomercials and show our students infomercials. The  reason that people hate infomercials is because they sell junk.    It doesn't deliver on the promise. If they worked, we wouldn't hate them so  much.      So getting the customer's trust, that you actually know what problem they  have delivers so much. Then when you do actually fix the problem, that's  sort of like a cherry on top of the trust sundae, since today's been full of  metaphors. Then you've also got a customer who's not only happy, but wants  to talk about you and your product and how much your product is awesome.     Not because your product is awesome as your product helped make them  awesome. The product solved their problem.    A customer whose problem is solved is going to talk about the fact that  they're problem is solved and you get to go along for the ride.

Reframing competition, creating shared value  Reimagining value delivery, organizing for innovation     “You've got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology” –  Steve Jobs  A number of years ago, I facilitated a multi-day strategy workshop at the company I was  working  for.  During  dinner  the  director  of  sales  explained  his  perspective  on  the  workshop’s purpose: “We have to figure out how to get customers for all they are worth.”  He gestured as if wringing a towel. “If the towels gets dry, you have to squeeze harder. A  good leader knows how to do that, and a good strategy makes it easier.”  He was serious. I was horrified. Our markets are not people “out there” we shake down  for loose change. Customers are our most valuable assets, I thought. We should strive to  learn from them so that we can provide better products and services.  The director’s perspective was shortsighted. He believed the business of our business was  more sales. That may be fine in the short term, but ultimately this narrow perspective  leads to failure. Organizations looking for sustained success need to break this mold.   Companies  frequently  don’t  realize  that  as  the  business  grows,  it  must  also  widen  its  strategic field of vision. I call this misstep strategy myopia. It happens time and time  again: organizations ultimately don’t know what business they are really in.  Take  Kodak.  The  film  giant  dominated  film  market  for  over  a  century,  but  filed  for  bankruptcy  in  2012.  Many  people  believe  that  Kodak  failed  because  it  missed  digital  camera technology. This is not true. In fact, Kodak invented the first digital camera in  1975.   Kodak failed because it had the myopic view it was in the film business instead of the  storytelling business. Leaders feared digital technology would cannibalize profits. They  believed they could protect their existing business through marketing and sales. It was a  nearsightedness in strategy, not technology, that led to Kodak’s downfall.   Successful  organizations  continually  innovate  and  expand  their  horizons.  Incremental  improvements are not enough. Technical R&D is not enough. Instead, they must grow by  questioning the type and scope of value they create.        !  1!   Diagrams of experiences offer a type of insight is often overlooked in strategy creation: a  view from the individual’s perspective. This chapter shows how mapping experiences can  contribute missing strategic insight and ultimately serve as a corrective lens for strategy  myopia.   The  chapter  concludes  with  a  review  of  some  complementary  techniques  that  extend  experience mapping to better visualize strategy. By the end of the chapter you should get  a sense how diagrams broaden your field of vision.  A New Way of Seeing  The context of business has changed over the last few decades. Consumers are have real  power: they have access to prices, product information, and alternative providers around  the world. Traditional approaches to sales—wringing a market for what it’s worth—do  not work anymore for sustained growth.    Instead,  organizations  need  to  reverse  their  thinking.  Renowned  business  leader  Ram  Charan,  for  one,  urges  companies  invert  the  traditional  sales  perspective.  In  his  book  What The Customer Wants You To Know, he illustrates flow of value insight opposite to  traditional approaches  FIGURE 3-1 .        FIGURE 3-1: Understanding value from the consumer’s perspective   reverses the flow of insight.    Insight about users is not a nuisance, it’s a strategic opportunity. The objective is not a  push, it’s a pull.  You don’t sell products, you buy customers.   This idea runs contrary to typical strategic decision making, but it is not new. As earlier  as 1960 renowned Harvard business professor Theodore Levitt discusses the importance  of focusing on human needs first. In his influential article Marking Myopia* Levitt writes:   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  * Many of the themes and ideas in this chapter were directly derived from Levitt’s landmark article, including  the term strategy myopia. This article is still relevant and highly recommended. See: Theodore Levitt.  “Marketing Myopia,” Harvard Business Review  1960    !  2!   An industry begins with the customer and his needs, not with a patent, a raw material, or  a  selling  skill.  Given  the  customer’s  needs,  the  industry  develops  backwards,  first  concerning itself with the physical delivery of customer satisfaction. Then it moves back  further to creating the things by which these satisfactions are in part achieved. How these  materials are created is a matter of indifference to the customer, hence the particular form  of manufacturing, processing, or what-have-you cannot be considered as vital aspects of  the industry.    Consider  the  failure  of  the  railroad  industry  in  the  US,  a  favorite  example  of  Levitt.  During  their  heyday  at  the  beginning  of  the  20th  century,  railroads  were  extremely  profitable and attractive to Wall Street investors. No one in that business could imagine  its demise just a few decades later.   But railroads didn’t stop growing in the middle of the century because of competition  from the technology of cars, trucks, planes, and even telephones. They stopped growing  because they let rivals take customers. Their intense focus on their own products led to  strategy  myopia:  they  saw  themselves  in  the  railroad  business  rather  than  the  transportation business.   Though no panacea, mapping experiences provides insight that helps expand the strategic  aperture. For example, Tim Brown, CEO of IDEO, describes his company’s work with  Amtrak in his book Change by Design. His firm was brought in to redesign the seats of  the Acela trains. The goal was to make the travel experience more pleasurable.   Rather  than  diving  into  the  seat  redesign,  however,  they  first  mapped  an  end-to-end  journey  around  train  travel,  in  general.  They  identified  about  12  unique  stages  in  the  experience. This lead to different conclusions about their focus and how to improve the  travel experience. Brown writes:   The insight that proved most striking was that passengers did not take their seats on the  train until stage eight—most of the experience of train travel, in other words, did not  involve  the  train  at  all.  The  team  reasoned  that  every  one  of  the  prior  steps  was  an  opportunity  to  create  a  positive  interaction,  opportunities  that  would  have  been  overlooked if they head focused only on the design of the seats.    Alignment diagrams are a type of tool that point to such new opportunities. They visually  align a description of the individual’s experience with the offerings of an organization.  They  start  with  the  customer’s  experience  and  work  back  towards  the  technology,  as  Steve Jobs once said reflected in the quote opening this chapter.  Consider the opportunities highlighted at the bottom of the Rail Europe diagram created  by Chris Risdon in Chapter 1  see FIGURE 1-5 . These suggest tactical solutions, but go  beyond that to point to larger, strategic questions. Should they become a provider of a  travel information? Should they integrate with retailers and ecommerce partners? How  can they reinvent support or the ticketing experience? This strategic insight is directly  tied to the actual experience of train travel and shown in context in the diagram.   In this sense, diagrams offer a new way of seeing your markets, your organization, and  your strategy—from the outside-in rather from the inside-out. Logically, they are most  effective at initial stages of providing a service  FIGURE 3-2 .      !  3!      FIGURE 3-2: Alignment diagrams provide insight from the outside-in  and are best created upfront to inform strategic decision-making    I believe the process of diagraming helps correct strategy myopia. In my experience, the  resulting  diagrams  invariably  show  a  much  broader  picture  of  customer  needs  than  a  business currently addresses.  But expanding your strategic field of vision requires change. The organization as whole  must adapt to a new mindset. In particular, there are four key aspects involved:  1.  Reframing competition  2.  Creating shared value  3.  Reimagining value delivery  4.  Organizing to innovate   The next sections describe these aspects and how mapping experiences can play a role in  each.  1. Reframe Competition  Traditionally,  firms  categorize  customers  by  demographic  or  psychographic  attributes:  age, income, race, marital status, and so on. Or, they may look at purchasing behavior or  company size.   In doing so, managers create categories that don’t match their actual customer needs and  motivations. No one ever bought a product because of their age or income. The typical  one-size-fits  all  approach  their  demographic categories arbitrarily.  An alternative model sees the market from the customer’s perspective. Put simply, people  buy products to get a job done. The outcomes people seek, not the customers themselves,  are the primary dimension for meaningful segmentation  FIGURE 3-3 .     inevitably  fails,  causing  managers   to  reshuffle   !  4!      FIGURE 3-3: Typical segmentation by demographic and behavioral  dimensions  left  versus segmentation by desired outcomes  right    Recalling Levitt, Clayton Christensen and coauthors Scott Cook and Taddy Hall point to  the failure of traditional segmentation practices. In their article “Marketing Malpractice”  they write:    …The  prevailing  methods  of  segmentation  that  budding  managers  learn  in  business  schools and then practice in the marketing departments of good companies are actually a  key  reason  that  new  product  innovation  has  become  a  gamble  in  which  the  odds  of  winning are horrifyingly low.  There is a better way to think about market segmentation and new product innovation.  The structure of a market, seen from the customers’ point of view, is very simple: They  just need to get things done, as Ted Levitt said. When people find themselves needing to  get a job done, they essentially hire products to do that job for them.    Shifting  your  perspective  on  segmentation  reframes  the  competition.  The  job,  not  the  industry or category as defined by analysts determines competition in the mind of the  user. You don’t compete against products and services in your category: you compete  against anything that gets the job done from the user’s point of view.  For instance, Scott Cook, founder of the tax software giant Intuit, once said:   The greatest competitor [in tax software] … was not in the industry. It was the pencil.  The pencil is a tough and resilient substitute. Yet the entire industry had overlooked it.*   Think about it: when preparing taxes making a quick calculation on a pad of paper is  natural  and  hard  to  improve  on.  Cook  knew  his  software  needed  to  not  only  outperforming  other  tax  software  packages,  it  also  needed  to  be  more  effective  and  simple to use as a pencil. Seen this way, tax software competes with pencils and anything  else that gets the job done.  Diagrams  can  be  used  to  track  alternative  means  of  getting  a  job  done.  For  example,  FIGURE 3-4 is an excerpt from a diagram detailing the workflow of barristers in Australia.  It was part of a research effort I lead while at LexisNexis, a leading provider of legal   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  * Quoted in Scott Berkun’s book The Myths of Innovation  O’Reilly, 2007     !  5!   information.*  The  bottom  row  shows  how  we  mapped  different  ways  of  getting  work  done  in grey  to the steps in the workflow.   After visualizing competing solutions across the entire experience, I found barristers are  as likely to do legal research at libraries or with free online resources as with our flagship  database. This was eye-opening for stakeholders. The diagrams clearly illustrated how  and where they contend with different services.       FIGURE 3-4: A section of a diagram of a barrister’s workflow. The  elements at the bottom show the organization’s solutions  in orange    and competing solutions  in grey     Business leader Rita Gunther McGrath believes markets should be seen in terms of what  she  calls  arenas.  Arenas  are  characterized  by  the  experiences  people  have  and  their  connection  to  a  provider.  She  writes  in  her  bestselling  book  The  End  of  Competitive  Advantage:   The  driver  of  categorization  will  in  all  likelihood  be  the  outcomes  that  particular  customers seek  “jobs to be done”  and the alternative ways those outcomes might be  met. This is vital because the most substantial threats to a given advantage are likely to  arise from a peripheral or nonobvious location.    Diagrams of experiences challenge assumptions of who your competition really is. They  reflect the needs of individual and illustrate the broader experience in which they are   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  *!See the case study included in Chapter 11 for more details on this project.!  !  6!   relevant. This in turn enables you to see the market from the perspective of the customer,  not by synthetic segmentation and traditional industry categorization.    2. Create Shared Value  After World War II, US corporations assumed a general retain-and-reinvest approach to  strategy. They put earnings back into the company, benefiting employees and making the  firm more competitive.   This gave way to a  downsize-and-distribute posture in the 1970s. Reducing costs and  maximizing financial returns, particularly for shareholders, became a priority. The widely  held economic policy belief was that profit is good for society: the more companies can  earn, the better off we all are.  This policy does not work.* As a whole, we are not better off. Since the 70s, American  workers have been working more and making less. At the same time, shareholder value in  the form of dividends and CEO wages have experienced a massive upturn. As a result,  trust in corporations is at an all-time low. Businesses are increasingly blamed for many of  social, environmental, and economic problems in general.   The good news is that the balance is shifting. There’s a move from shareholder value to  shared value. In his landmark article, "Creating Shared Value," strategy expert Michael  Porter  recognizes  a  tipping  point  in  business:  no  longer  can  companies  operate  at  the  expense of the markets they serve. He writes:   A big part of the problem lies with companies themselves, which remain trapped in an  outdated approach to value creation that has emerged over the past few decades. They  continue to view value creation narrowly, optimizing short-term financial performance in  a  bubble  while  missing  the  most  important  customer  needs  and  ignoring  the  broader  influences that determine their longer-term success.   This position is contrary to well-articulated belief that businesses have no agenda beyond  making profit. Shared value instead links revenue to creating social benefit. This, in turn,  provides a competitive advantage back to the organization. It’s a win-win approach.   Shared value goes beyond social responsibility. It touches the heart of an organization’s  strategy. Every time a customer interacts with a company it creates value for society.  There are three ways of thinking about shared value strategically:    1.  Reconceive  your  offering.  For  example,  Skype  launched  a  program  called  “skype  in  the  classroom.”  With  this,  teachers  can  collaborate  with  other  instructors around the world and design different learning experiences for their  students. In other words, Skype is not only in the videoconferencing business,  they provide educational collaboration opportunities for customers.  Innovate  how  products  and  services  are  produced.  For  example,  Intercontinental  Hotels  Group   IHG   introduced  its  GreenEngage  program  in  2009 to address its environmental footprint. To date, they’ve achieved energy  savings  of  about  25%,  and  IHG  differentiates  itself  with  this  program  to   2.   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  * For more on the adverse effects of maximizing shareholder value on society, see William Lazonick’s critical  article “Profits Without Prosperity,” Harvard Business Review  Sep 2014    !  7!   customers. In other words, IHG is not just a provider of hotel rooms, they are in  the business of creating environmentally conscious communities.    3.  Collaborate with partners in new ways. Nestlé, for example, worked closely  with dairy farmers in India, investing in technology to build a competitive milk  supply  systems.  These  simultaneously  generated  social  benefits  through  improved health care. In other words, Nestle doesn’t just produce food products,  they are in the nutrition business.    The  notion  of  shared  value  means  that  organizations  need  to  conceive  their  value  proposition on a way that takes many perspectives into account. Chief among these is a  deep understanding human needs. For instance, in a video interview Porter advises:  Figure out what your product is and what your value chain is. Understand where those  things touch important social needs and problems. If you’re in financial services, let’s  think  about  ‘saving’  or  ‘buying  a  home’  -  but  in  a  way  that  actually  works  for  the  consumer.   Now  consider  FIGURE  3-5,  a  diagram  of  buying  a  home  created  by  Sofia  Hussain,  a  leading digital strategist in Norway. It shows the services of a fictitious home-listings  company  in  the  inner  circle,  labeled  inside  activities.  The  activities  of  the  user—the  outside  activities—are  listed  in  the  bigger  circle.  Also  included  are  touchpoint  types,  illustrated with small icons.   !  8!      FIGURE 3-5: A map of the experience of “buying a home” created by   Sofia Hussain   In her article, “Designing Digital Strategies, Part 2,” Hussain suggests a strategic scenario  for  the  company:  they  want  to  expand  their  business  with  services  that  address  more  customer needs in this domain. The intent is to move from a business for simply buying a  home and moving to one that helps people settle into a new home. This diagram can be  used to illustrate how that expansion fits into the overall experience from the customer’s  perspective.  Shared value goes one step further by increasing services or moving into a playing field.  It requires the company to ask how they might also create social benefit.   For  example  the  company  might  promote  healthier  lifestyles  by  offering  coordinating  home listings with information about neighborhood walkability. Examining the map in  FIGURE 3-x, services around selecting a neighborhood and finding a new home are points  of interaction where presenting walkability information make sense.   But potential saved costs of walking could also be included in determining what you can  afford.  Perhaps  the  system  could  show  how  much  money  is  saved  by  reducing  gas  expenses or getting rid of a car altogether.    !  9!   With  shared  value  in  mind,  the  strategic  aspiration  of  the  company  becomes  even  broader: it’s more than just about buying a home or even settling into a home: it’s about  creating a healthier, environmentally-friendly lifestyle when buying a new home.   Diagrams help us think through the interactions and customer needs in a holistic way.  They look at an offering in a way that actually works for the consumer—to recall Porter.  Finding shared business value relies on such examinations of the overall experience.    3. Reimagine Value Delivery  As  the  size  of  computer  chips  get  smaller  and  smaller,  it  becomes  increasingly  more  feasible  to  embed  processing  power  into  common  objects.  Once  fitted  with  a  microcontroller,  physical  products  can  connect  to  the  Internet. Dubbed  the  Internet  of  Things  IoT , smart, connected devices expand possibilities and how you deliver value.   The Belkin crockpot  FIGURE 3-6 , for example, takes a regular kitchen appliance and  connects it to the internet. With an accompanying app, cooks can now control the device  remotely. The crockpot can also be linked to other devices inside and outside the home.            FIGURE 3-6: The Belkin WeMo CrockPot Slow Cooker is connected to   the internet.    When everything from computers to cookware has a digital component, the design of the  overall  experience  becomes  more  challenging.  Success  determined  by  how  well  their  services fit with each other and, more importantly, how well they fit into people’s lives.  Part of the value that organizations deliver, then, is how their offerings integrate into a  larger ecosystem  FIGURE 3-7     !  10!      FIGURE 3-7: As products become smart and connected, they fit into an   ecosystem of services   Diagrams  visualize  the  components  of  the  ecosystem.  For  example,  Claro  Partners,  a  leading  European  design  consultancy  based  in  Barcelona,  developed  a  straightforward  approach for mapping the various elements in an IoT system. They created a series of  cards for different aspects typically involved  FIGURE 3-x . Teams fill out cards and then  arrange them into a diagram of the ecosystem.    FIGURE 3-8: IoT cards created by Claro Partners, used to generate an   ecosystem map of connected services   FIGURE 3-9 shows an example of a resulting map, in this case for the Nike Fuelband. It  reveals  important  interdependencies  in  the  experience,  such  as  a  relationship  between  Fuelband  users,  as  well  as  a  connection  between  physical  devices,  software,  and  data  services.         !  11!      FIGURE 3-9: A simple diagram of an ecosystem of connected services   created by Claro Partners    IoT doesn’t just make it harder to conceive and design new products. It fundamentally  changes strategy. Your service will inevitably be part of a system of services. Creating  and delivering value into that system cannot be ignored. Diagrams help you understand  the complexities and interrelationships involved.    4. Organize for Innovation  Some leaders have a Darwinistic view of innovation: they believe best new concepts will  rise to surface on their merit alone. This perspective fails to take into account corporate  antibodies  motivated  to  protect  existing  revenue  that  can  squash  fledgling  ideas  summarily.   How the organization is structured is part of the problem. The best ideas will fail if they  are  feed  into  an  organization  that  is  not  set  up  to  accept  them.  The  first  step  is  to  overcome motivations and incentives that seek to optimize short term financial returns.   Charles  O’Reilly and Michael  Tushman  recommend  establishing  an  ambidextrous  organization. To do this, set up divisions within the organization that have separate goals  and expectations  FIGURE 3-10 . This is particularly important for emerging businesses,  where new ideas need a chance to take hold.     !  12!      FIGURE 3-10: The ambidextrous organization separates effort types   structurally   Beyond  becoming  ambidextrous,  you  also  need  to  organize  around  the  customer  experience. For instance, a client at an ecommerce provider once introduced himself as a  member  of  the  Discovery  group.  He  explained  their  jobs  was  to  help  people  find  the  products  they  offered,  regardless  of  channel  or  medium.  They  also  had  teams  for  Purchasing  and  Success.  In  other  words,  their  organization  mirrored  the  customer  journey, not functional lines or technology types  FIGURE 3-11 .      FIGURE 3-11: An example of organizing around the customer   experience   Some functions spanned these experience-centric teams. But people in those roles were  compelled  to  align  to  the  customer  oriented  teams  in  conversations  and  in  decision  making. The effect was a new type of creative problem solving within the organization.  Solutions better matched customer needs.   Alignment diagrams provide the basis for this type of organization. They reveal a model  to follow that mirrors the individual’s experience. This leads to a new way of seeing your  offerings, which in turn foster innovation.   Mapping Strategy  Strategy  is  typically  created  behind  closed  doors  at  the  top  levels  of  an  organization.  Leaders then reveal the strategy to the rest of the organization—usually as a PowerPoint  presentation. Employees are then expect to “get it” and somehow be able to magically  align their work to the strategy.    !  13!   But when things go wrong later on, these same leaders blame failure on poor execution.  They overlook the fact that strategy and its execution are related: a brilliant strategy that  can’t be implemented isn’t brilliant.   Poor communication is only part of problem. How strategy gets created also matters. The  process must overcome gaps in understanding across the entire organization. Otherwise,  the realization of strategic intent has no chance.   Business consultant and author Nilofer Merchant has observed a disconnect between the  top and bottom layers in many organizations. She describes it as an Air Sandwich in her  book The New How  O’Reilly, 2009 . Merchant explains:   An Air Sandwich is, in effect, a strategy that has a clear vision and future direction on the  top layer, day-to-day action on the bottom, and virtually nothing in the middle–no meaty  key decisions that connect the two layers, no rich chewy center filling to align the new  direction with the new actions within the company.   To address the Air Sandwich, companies should view strategy creation as an inclusive  endeavor. But the traditional tools strategy creation only confound the situation. Words  are  abstract  and  open  to  interpretation.  Documents  bewilder  and  confuse.  Emails  and  communications are unintelligible by those who must implementing a strategy.   Diagrams  are  an  antidote.  They  open  up  strategy  for  broader  involvement  across  an  organization and increase general comprehension.   The next sections describe several tools that complement alignment diagrams. They all  seek to visualize strategy or parts of it. These include strategy maps, the strategy canvas,  the  strategy  blueprint,  and  the  business  model  canvas  and  value  proposition  canvas.  Diagrams of experiences plug in to these techniques, informing customer-related aspects.   Strategy Map   A strategy map represents an organization’s entire strategy on a single sheet of paper.  The  technique  was  made  popular  by  veteran  business  consultants  Robert  Kaplan  and  David Norton in their book Strategy Maps. This approach emerged from research and  years  of  experience  consulting  with  client  companies  and  is  part  of  their  earlier  framework called the balanced scorecard.   FIGURE 3-12 shows an example of a generic strategy map. Each row represents objectives  from one of four strategic perspectives:      Learning and growth of employees—This perspective outlines the knowledge,   skills, and systems that the organization needs to deliver the intended value.  Internal processes—Goals at this level reflect the capabilities and efficiencies  of organization as a whole          Customers—This perspective represents the value proposition. Here, alignment   diagrams reveal what customers actually perceive as valuable.       Financials—The  top  level  objectives  centered  on  the  value  captured  by  the   organization in terms of financial gains.   The resulting map is more than just a list of goals. The map connects the objectives to  show  causality.  From  this  standpoint,  strategy  is  a  series  of  IF-THEN  statements,  as  Kaplan and Norton point out.   !  14!       FIGURE 3-12: A generic strategy map showing the hierarchy of   relationships between objectives.   Consider  a  simple  example  strategy  map  for  Patagonia  in  FIGURE  3-13  created  by  Michael Ensley, a business consultant with PureStone Partners. Environmental goodwill  is a key strategic objective prominent in the diagram. Anchoring it here makes it visible  to everyone else in the organization.    The center of this example shows how Patagonia intends to create customer value. A key  internal process is indicated as solve their [i.e., customer] problems, which is linked to  two aspects: provide extreme gear and protect our clients. Alignment diagrams foster the  type of conversations needed to arrive at these problems to solve.    !  15!      FIGURE 3-13: An example of a strategy canvas for the sporting goods   company Patatgonia   Strategy  maps  provide  a  balanced  view  of  the  interlocking  set  of  strategic  choices  an  organization makes. They illustrate the relationships in objectives and allows others to  see how their activities fit into the strategic whole.    Strategy Canvas  The  strategy  canvas  is  a  visual  tool  to  both  diagnose  existing  strategies  and  build  alternative ones. It was developed by W. Chan Kim and Renee Maubornge around 2000  and featured in their groundbreaking book Blue Ocean Strategy. FIGURE 3-14 shows an  example strategy canvas for Southwest Airlines.   !  16!      FIGURE 3-14: An example of a strategy canvas for Southwest airlines   Across the bottom are the primary factors of competition. These are aspects that create  value for customers and the dimensions along which firms compete. The vertical axis  indicates relative performance for each factor from low to high. This arrangement reveals  a picture of how several organizations create value compared to each other.  A  strategy  canvas  reflects  the  key  dynamic  in  the  blue  ocean  strategy  approach.  Red  oceans, Kim and Maubornge explain, represent fierce competition of existing industries  in  a  given  domain.  As  the  space  gets  crowded,  market  share  for  each  organization  dwindles, and the waters become bloody.  Blue oceans represent uncontested market space. Demand is created rather than fought  over.  Their  advice  is  clear:  don’t  directly  compete  with  rivals;  instead,  make  them  irrelevant.   To do this you must make hard tradeoffs. Southwest chooses not to compete along the  traditional  factors  of  airline  service.  Instead,  they  focus  on  frequent  departures  from  smaller airports. In doing so, Southwest competes with car travel: customers who may  have driven between two cities might now consider flying with Southwest instead. The  airline trades off hub connectivity with frequent departures to do this.   The process for creating a strategy canvas takes the following steps:   1.  Determine factors of value creation. It may be easy to come up with dozens of  potential factors. The key is to focus on the most important ones. This is where  alignment diagrams come in: they help identify these factors. They show what  problems the organizations and how value is perceived from their perspective.    2.  Determine competitor types. The trick is to select a limited set of representative   competitors. Three is ideal. Including more than four competitors reduces the impact  of the resulting diagram greatly.    !  17!   3.  Rate performance for each factor. Typically this is estimated on a relative scale of   low to high. It’s also possible to get empirical evidence for each rating, such as  through a survey.    An alternative approach to determining the factors of value creation is to focus on types  of  experiences individuals have. For instance, from a customer journey map you may  have  identified  half  a  dozen  or  so  phases  of  interaction,  e.g.,  becoming  aware,  purchasing, initiating the service, using the service, extending and renewing, and getting  support. For each you can compare how competing services perform  see FIGURE 3-15 .      Figure 3-15: An example experience-based strategy canvas   This approach may not help you find a blue ocean per se, but provides valuable insight  and an experience-based view of the strategic landscape.    Strategy Blueprint  Strategy is difficult to define precisely. On the one hand, it gets confused with analysis.  This  includes  everything  from  market  size  to  technical  assessments  to  financial  prognosis. The result is often reports that fill up dozens of pages.   On  the  other  hand,  strategy  gets  conflated  with  planning.  You’ve  probably  witnessed  annual strategy retreats in your organization, where leaders spend several days forging  plans for the upcoming year. They then emerge from seclusion with detailed roadmaps  and financial plans that become quickly obsolete.   Analysis  and  planning,  while  necessary  inputs  and  outputs  in  the  strategy  creation  process, are not the core of strategy. You can’t analyze your way to strategy: the answers  don’t magically emerge from data. And detailed roadmaps don’t provide the rationale for  the activity they organize. Strategy does.  see FIGURE 3-16 .   !  18!      FIGURE 3-16: Strategy provides logic between analysis and planning   Strategy is about devising a way you believe you’ll best overcome challenges to reach a  desired  position.  It  is  a  creative  endeavor,  not  based  on  analysis  and  planning  alone.  Strategy represents the logic that connects analysis and planning. Ultimately, it’s how  your organization makes sense of its actions and decisions over time.   I developed the strategy blueprint as a tool to visualize this central strategic rationale.* It  uses a canvas format to help visualize the relationships between elements of the strategy.   FIGURE 3-17 shows an example of filled out strategy blueprint. In this case, it reflects the  strategy  of  a  fictitious  company,  Einstein  Media  Company,  a  publisher  of  scientific  journals,  books,  and  information.  The  company  has  lead  the  industry  for  nearly  100  years, and scientist around the world trust their brand name.     !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  * You can download a PDF of the strategy blueprint from my  blog:  https:  experiencinginformation.wordpress.com 2015 09 02 strategy-blueprint    19!     !      FIGURE 3-17: The strategy blueprint template for a fictitious company,   Einstein Media Company   The elements in the strategy blueprint are based on research in the field. First, it borrows  from  Henry  Mintzberg’s  five  Ps  of  strategy  from  his  book Strategy  Safari.  These  are  combined with Roger Martin and A.G. Lafley’s five questions of strategy in their recent  book Playing To Win.  Both books are highly recommended .   TABLE 3-1summarizes and aligns these two existing frameworks.

Challenges.  Strategy implies the need for change, a desire to move from point A  to point B. What are the hurdles to doing so? What opposing forces must you  overcome to be able to reach your goals?       Aspirations. What kind of organization do you aspire to be? What do you aspire  for customers and for society? Alignment diagrams offer information that can  inform creating a strategic aspiration.       Focus areas.  Setting a scope to your strategy helps you concentrate effort on the  things that matter most. Who will you serve? What regions will you play in?  Which jobs to be done will you target?       Guiding  principles.  These  are  the  pillars  of  your  strategy  you  believe  will  overcome  the  challenges  you  face.  What  mantras  will  unite  teams  and  unify  decision making?

Note that this is not about making a roadmap or plans,  rather looking at the skills and capabilities you’ll ultimately need.       Measurements.  How  will  you  know  your  strategy  is  on  track?  How  can  you   show progress and success?    Building strategy is a creative endeavor. The strategy blueprint allows you to explore  options with no initial risk. Try alternatives, cross items off, rework ideas, and start over  again.  The  blueprint  helps  you  design  strategy. Use it in briefings, workshop, or as a  reference document.  There is no prescribed order to completing the blueprint. Typically, it’s best to start with  the challenges and aspirations. After that you may find yourself moving freely between  the boxes. The blueprint helps you see all the moving parts of strategy at once, making it  tangible and inclusive to others.   Business Model Canvas  The business model canvas is strategic management tool that helps business owners and  stakeholders discover different business models. Alexander Osterwalder first introduced  it  in  his  book  Business  Model  Generation   Wiley,  2010 .  It  has  become  very  popular  since them.   The nine boxes of the canvas represent the key components of a business model  FIGURE  3-18. . There is a logic to their arrangement. The boxes on the right represent market- facing aspects, called the front stage. On the left are the back stage element of a business  model—the internal business processes.    !  21!   Back!Stage!  Front!Stage!     FIGURE 3-18: Business model canvas by Alexander Osterwalder   The visual format of a canvas promotes exploration. You can quickly try out alternative  models and evaluate them before making a commitment in any one direction. It’s allows  you to apply creativity to business decisions.   FIGURE  8-19  shows  a  visualization  of  the  business  model  for  the  silicon  provider  Xiameter’s  compared  to  its  parent  company,  Dow  Corning.  It  is  based  on  the  article  “Dow Corning’s Big Pricing Gamble” by Loren Gary. The green notes represent Dow  Corning’s  core  business.  The  orange  notes  show  the  Xiameter  model.  Interestingly,  Xiameter seems to have had an effect back on the core business model, according to the  article. These aspects are shown in blue notes.   !  22!   FIGURE 8-19: The business model of Xiameter, a provider of silicon, to   its parent Dow Corning   FIGURE 8-20 shows a photo of a canvas I completed with together stakeholders after an  ideation session. Using sticky notes, we were able to move information around as needed  and  consider  any  possible  alternatives.  This  allowed  us  to  test  assumptions  of  a  new  concept from a standpoint of business viability.       !  23!      Figure 8-20: An example business model canvas using sticky notes to   explore options   Working with the business model canvas takes some practice. You have to be able to  recognize different types of information quickly and sort them into their respective boxes.  Once you get the hang of it, use the canvas to quickly discover alternatives. There are  many resources online to learn more about the business model canvas.   Value Proposition Canvas  The basic grid structure of the business model canvas inspired the development similar  tools. Once such example is the value proposition canvas  see FIGURE 8-21 , also created  Alexander Osterwalder. It is directly related to the business model canvas and plugs into  two business model elements: the customer segments you wish to create value for and the  value proposition you believe will attract customers.    !  24!      FIGURE 8-21: The Value Proposition Canvas created by Alexander   Osterwalder and his company, Strategizer.    The value proposition canvas allows you to design and test the fit between what you offer  and what customers want.    There are two parts. On the right is the customer profile with three components:      Jobs to be done: These are the important issues people want solved and the needs  they are trying to satisfy.       Pains: These are the barriers, hurdles, and annoyances people have in trying to get a   job done. This includes negative emotions and risks they may encounter.       Gains. These are positive outcomes or benefits the individual desires.   The other half of the canvas on the left side details the features of your value proposition.  There are three elements here:       Products & services: These represent your offering, including the features and   support you provide.         Pain  relievers:  This  is  a  description  of  how  your  offering  will  alleviate  the   customer’s pains. These show which problems you’re addressing.       Gain  creators:  These  make  explicit  how  your  products  and  service  benefit   customers.    By mapping the left side to the right side, you can make explicit how you are creating  value for your customers. When the pain relievers and gain creators correlate to the pains  and gains of customers, you have a potential strong fit. Validate your assumptions with  your markets once you have a formed a clear position.     !  25!   Summary  As  organizations  mature,  they  develop  strategy  myopia—a  failure  to  see  the  broader  landscape  of  their  business  and  how  they  can  continue  to  create  meaningful  value.  Successful enterprises start with insights about customer needs and work backwards to  their  strategy.  This  reverses  many  existing  practices  in  business,  which  seek  to  push  products and service through traditional sales channels.    To change, organizations need to consider additional sources of insight often left out of  strategy creation. This includes a deep understanding of how customer perceive value.  Visualizations of various kinds broaden your field of vision and offer new way of seeing.   First, consider how to reframe competition. In the eyes of your customer, anything that  gets the job done is your rival.   Also consider how you contribute back to society and create shared value. Shared value  is  about  creating  societal  benefits  with  every  customer  interaction,  going  far  beyond  corporate social responsibility.  The internet of things forces us to reimagine value delivery. Connected, smart products  inevitably  become  part  of  a  larger  ecosystem.  The  value  you  create  is  delivered  and  experienced as part of that context.   Finally, organize to innovate. First, separate protecting existing value from creating new  value by setting up different divisions in the organization. Then, organize teams to align  with the customer experience.    Visualizations tend to open up strategy, making it not only more understandable but also  more  inclusive  across  the  organization.  Several  techniques  help  illustrate  strategy  graphically. These include strategy maps, strategy canvases, the strategy blueprint, and  the business model canvas and value proposition canvas. They complement and extend  alignment diagramming.

It  is  one  of  the  most  lucid  and  useful  approaches  to  strategy  available  today. The authors provide case studies and examples from their decades of experience.  This is essential reading for anyone looking to understand strategy.     W.  Chan  Kim  &  Renee  Mauborgne. Blue  Ocean  Strategy  Harvard  Business  Review  Press, 2005    This landmark book from the pioneers of blue ocean strategy explains the approach in  detail. The key isn’t to compete with rivals directly, the authors urge, rather to make them  irrelevant.  To  do  this,  organizations  need  to  find  new  attributes  of  value  creation.  Visualizing the landscape in a strategy canvas is a key way to identify opportunities of  this  kind.  Many  of  the  blue  ocean  strategy  tools  and  resources  are  available  on  the  internet, e.g., at www.blueoceanstrategy.com.    Rita  McGrath. The  End  of  Competitive  Advantage  Harvard  Business  Review  Press,  2013    !  26!   Strategy is stuck, declares McGrath in the compelling book. Existing frameworks view  strategy as achieving a sustainable competitive advantage. Instead, organizations need to  develop a new set of practices based on transient competitive advantage. This entails not  only  constantly  finding  new  value,  but  also  ramping  down  existing  offerings  as  they  become  exhausted.  This  is  an  eye-opening  book  that  is  accessible  to  non-business  readers.    Michael Porter “What Is Strategy,” Harvard Business Review  1996    This is one of the most cited articles on strategy. Though dense at times, strategy guru  Michael Porter lays out a clear perspective on strategy. The crux of strategy, he explains,  is making tradeoffs that differentiate one firm’s offerings from another.

Chapter 5   Culture and Communication   Introduction  As we mentioned at the beginning of the book, the strategic and programmatic capture,  management and analysis of user behavior data are typically not considered to be a part  of good design practice. Indeed, quantitative data collection and analysis to drive design  decisions  in  particular  has  been  contentious  and  has  sometimes  even  had  a  polarizing  effect on designers and product managers.   However, we believe that designers need to play a part in the design of data capture and  analysis, as we have argued in earlier chapters. We also believe that designers can play a  key  strategic  role  in  companies  by  engaging  in  the  design  of  data  communication  strategies  and  practices.  However,  to  communicate  most  effectively  you  need  to  be  willing to interrogate and get your hands into the data yourself, to be part of designing the  tests so you know where the results came from.   This chapter follows on from our description of business cultures in Chapter 2 to address  company culture and specifically group and company communication cultures. We focus  on  communicating  data  driven  and  data  informed  ideas,  showcasing  where  product  excellence is derived from systematic and programmatic engagement with data and how  to put the foundations in place for a data aware group and company culture. Creating a  culture  where  all  of  this  comes  together  well  really  depends  on  three  key  things:    the  material to be presented, the presentation format and process, and the people.    When you have a culture that supports data communication and prioritizes collaborative  learning, it is easier to create strategic, tactical and operational business alignment. More  than that, as a design practitioner, data is one of the best ways to persuade people of your  case, to support your arguments and this to more effectively advocate for your users and  create the most effective and delightful experiences. Data allows you to bring your users’  voice into the conversation, helps you know which interactions are the most important  and when. In some senses the usage data you capture is a representation of your user, of  what they care about and when, of what they need and don’t need. So you need to design  your data to help you know your user better.  Although we focus on communication here, we don’t intend this chapter to offer you the  foundations for becoming a marketer PR person, nor a data visualization expert. These      1       are both of skillsets and competencies you may want to hire for and or leverage as you  design  your  company’s  internal-  and  external-facing  communication  strategies.  Rather,  we are advocating that you work by enacting 6 principle activities:   1  aim for shared understanding of the value of user centered as a company universal,  by …   2   laying  the  foundations  for  engaged  and  transparent  conversations  about  systematic  data collection, in order to …   3   create  alignment,  and  locate  and  establish  allies  and  co-partners  across  company  functions.   Also aim to    4  hire and internally recruit the right people, and to    5  articulate the long term benefits and the ability to do effective pattern finding across  different kinds of data set and to    6  drive a culture of learning, and communicate what you’ve learned with clarity and  integrity.   On integrity, in our next chapter we will investigate more on the issues to do with ethical  data collection.  In this chapter, we’ll cover two things:   1   What a data informed culture looks like  2   Some tactics that you can use to get there    Benefits of designing your culture of communication  When  it  comes  to  user  data,  summarization  and  communication  are  key  to  having  an  impact on business.   In a recent Harvard Business Review article  April 2014  the benefits of being a design  led organization were outlined. It is clear that those design organizations that are most  successful are ones where communication is carefully crafted.  What are the benefits of carefully crafting and designing communication around data? A  culture of communication allows deeper business understanding, including understanding  of  actual  and  hoped-for  users,  and  for  better  product  experience  over  a  customer  life- time. Creating a culture of questioning, learning and data innovation, and a culture that  develops  a  common  set  of  goals,  and  agreed  on  set  of  user-focused  metrics  and  a  common vocabulary will lead to a more successful business. There are a number of ways  of achieving this that we will discuss in this chapter:     cid:120   Aim  for  shared  understanding  of  the  value  of  user  centered  as  a  company   universal… which requires you to     cid:120   Lay the foundations for engaged and transparent conversations about systematic  data collection. You need to  create a dialogue, set expectations and develop a  common vocabulary.    cid:120   Create  alignment,  and  locate  and  establish  allies  and  co-partners  across   company functions….and….      2     cid:120   Build  a  team  through  strategic  hiring  to  reflect,  amplify  and  grow  the   above…..and    cid:120   Articulate the long term benefits and the ability to do effective pattern finding  across different kinds of data set by establishing a disciplined and consistent  approach to leveraging data that is programmatic, flexible and not rigid …..by   cid:120   Creating  a  learning  organization  to  ensure  you  perennially  grow  your   knowledge base.   We’ll walk through each of these points to help you think about which things you want to  adopt  for  your  organization  and  which  may  not  make  as  much  sense  for  you  or  your  team.  At the end of the chapter, we’ll suggest some tactics that you might use as you  build up your own culture of data informed design.  Principle 1   Aim for shared understanding of the value of user centered as a company  universal   For  a  data  informed  approach  to  be  successful  in  any  organization,  it  must  be  both  universally embraced and understood.  By “universal” we mean both in terms of depth    that  is  accepted  at  all  levels,  from  senior  executives  to  individual  contributors   and  breadth   that  it  is  accepted  throughout  the  company,  beyond  the  product  development  organization as well . This means that people at all levels in the company and across a  broad set of functions within the company recognize that all kinds of data are triangulated  to inform product decisions, and that they have a part to play in designing, understanding  and interrogating data.  It also means that they have at least a basic understanding of what  this process looks like and what the pros and cons are of using data are. This means that  there is a good “support net” for data informed design to happen – having this level of  transparency in the process and common understanding can help to keep the design and  product teams accountable to good practices.     Depth:  Top to bottom  Because a data and design framework is conceptualized as being in opposition to “gut”  decision  making,  it  is  often  also  about  breaking  the  hierarchical  decision  making  structure. Traditional management-led, top-down decision-making based on hunches goes  away, and is replaced by company-wide, all-level data literacy which includes addressing  well-formulated,  carefully  investigated  questions.  While  this  is  the  norm  for  business  analytics,  this  needs  to  be  developed  for  user  behavior  analysis  for  more  effective  customer-centric learning to drive product decisions.    This data may be collected using any number of techniques  such as ethnographic field  research,  field  deployments  of  prototypes,  surveys,  lab  studies  and  usability  research,  testing at scale using AB testing, etc.  Such grounded and carefully gathered user data  can  drive  your  decisions,  and  is  a  less  risky  prospect  than  relying  on  hunches  from  individual executives working from “gut feeling”.  An early paper that focused on AB  testing published in 2007 by Ron Kohavi, Randal Henne and Dan Sommerfield entitled  “Practical Guide to Controlled Expriements on the Web:  Listen to Your Customers not  to the HIPPO”1, addressed this issue:                                                                 1       3    ”Many organizations have strong managers who have strong opinions, but lack data, so  we started to use the term HiPPO, which stands for Highest Paid Person’s Opinion, as a  way to remind everyone that success really depends on the users’ perceptions.”  If you are trying to shift into a data informed framework, it will be critical to look at the  way product and design decisions were made previously made.  If these decisions were  largely in the hands of one or two individuals then it’s worth taking the time to make sure  that they can understand and recognize the value of bringing in user customer data into  the  decision  making  process  because  in  the  end,  they  may  find  that  their  weight  is  diminished  as is the “weight” of any individual opinion .  This is a good point to check  with yourself as well – are you comfortable and willing to see how depending more on  data  will  change  the  weight  of  your  own  opinion  within  the  design  and  product  development process?    Breadth:  beyond design and product  In  addition  to  getting  all  levels  of  an  organization  on  board  with  a  data  informed  approach, it can be just as important for teams outside of product and design to have a  basic  understanding  of  a  data  informed  framework  and  how  it’s  being  employed.    Company  cultures  that  embrace  transparency  are  company  cultures  that  encourage  participation and engagement from their staff.    Sharing well-summarised data will engage parts of the organization that are not normally  part of the design & product development process and make them feel like they have a  closer affinity with how the product is shaped. If people in organizations beyond product  and  design  feel  like  they  can  empathize  with  your  users,  then  they  can  also  feel  empowered as part of this process. A carefully articulated data and design framework is  something that many people beyond product and design can understand.  By being more  transparent  with  the  rest  of  the  company  about  how  product  and  design  decisions  are  being  made   and  especially  in  product  and  design  driven  companies ,  you  can  build  broader support within the company for the decisions that are being made.  There is another positive side effect of having your data informed approach being broadly  understood.  It may initially seem like it’s superfluous to have teams like recruiting, HR,  sales, or finance fundamentally understand a data driven approach.  However, it is always  helpful to have any team that you work with in any capacity understand how you do your  work.  Having recruiting and HR understand the company’s engagement with data helps  with attracting, attaining and retaining top talent, something we will turn to later in this  chapter. When product development teams understand what questions are being posed by  different parts of the company and how those questions are prioritized and then answered  through  data  helps  staff  understand  the  various  aspects  of  the  business.  This,  in  turn  empowers them further in the idea generation stage and better aligned around product and  business success. Imagine the sales executive who feels that they know exactly what you  need to build into your product but may be overly swayed by a key vocal client. If that  sales  executive  understands  that  you  build  product  by  looking  at  the  data,  then  they  realize that they need to start to articulate their arguments into the same framework  - and  it helps to get you and them aligned with what you are building, why you are building it  and what impact you think it will have on your overall user base.   There is a difference between using data to make and inform decisions in one part of an  organization  e.g. business strategy  and having it be universally embraced by the entire  organization.  To get this level of understanding throughout the company, using data has  to  be  something  that  you  actively  share within  all  parts of  the  company  and  has  to be      4    something  that  is  talked  about  and  participated  in  broadly   e.g.  in  company  all  hands  meetings and other public forums .      Principle 2    Create  a  dialog,  set  expectations,  establish  a  shared  vocabulary  and  lay  the  foundations  for  engaged  and  transparent  conversations  about  systematic  data  collection.      It  is  important  to  make  sure  that  the  people  in  your  organization  understand  at  least  superficially what’s involved and that they are essential to the process when it comes to  leveraging user data effectively. If a process isn’t already established in a company there  will always be some level of skepticism around something new. You might find that there  are  people  who  will  say  “Yes!    We  should  definitely  start  to  take  a  data  informed  approach to design, but we shouldn’t do X, Y and Z” or that what they think it means to  be data informed, might be something very specific  like only AB testing  and that they  aren’t considering the bigger picture where different kinds of data collection and analysis  fit together to answer strategically important questions.    Establishing a knowledge baseline  Therefore, having decided you want to enroll the company around data capture, analysis  and consumption, you will need to create a dialog. Find out what people really do know  and  don’t  know  about  taking  a  data  informed  approach  to  design.  Some  people  may  understand user research, but have much less experience with AB testing  or vice versa .   Find out what the biases and assumptions are about data informed design and do this at  all  levels  of  the  organization   from  CEO  to  individual  designer  or  product  manager .   Having all of this understanding up front about what people think and know can really  save a lot of time in the long run: You’ll be able to assess where you might want to focus  initially  in  terms  of  establishing  best  practices  and  you’ll  also  become  aware  of  any  challenges you might face as you try to get a data informed design process established.   Once you’ve established what the knowledge level is, where there is deep knowledge and  where there are opportunities for teaching, learning and sharing, then explicitly talk about  what practices you want to establish and why.  Getting your team and others that you  work  with  to agree  to  try out  some  of  these  things  that might  be new to  them  will  be  important  if  they’re  not  familiar  with  some  of  these  tactics.  It’s  always  good  to  set  expectations for what you will do and what you expect to see as a result, so saying “I’d  like to take an extra few days on this to make sure we have time for user feedback on  how  usable  this  flow  is.”    Makes  it  clear  that  the  cost  will  be  a  little  more  time  to  introduce something new and what level of results you hope to get from it.  Be clear about  what method you will be using to answer which questions and why; too often A B tests  are  used  to  answer  questions  that  would  have  been  better  suited  small-N,  lab  –based  usability  research  -  or  vice  versa.    This  leads  to  inappropriate  negative  evaluations  of  good methods. As we have shown in previous chapters, literacy in data collection and  analysis  methods  of  all  kinds  means  you  can  create  a  clear  rationale,  set  appropriate  expectations  and  offset  negative  reactions  and  loss  of  trust.  Data  ignorance  fuels  data  reticence.      5    Establishing a common vocabulary  A  key  part  of  establishing  a  shared  set  of  values  is  the  language  that  you  use.    Think  about  the  words  that  you  most  often  hear  at  your  company.    What  are  the  words  and  phrases  that  are  unique  to  your  company?    Which  acronyms  have  you  created  and  embraced?  When you first joined what were the things that stood out to you as unique?   Now  think  about  how  those  words  and  phrases  help  to  set  a  tone  for  how  business  is  conducted  within  the  company  and  how  usage  of  certain  phrases  make  you  feel  like  you’re part of an “in-group” or “in the know”.  To make a data informed decision-making  framework  is  universally  embraced,  it’s  then  important  to  actually  have  a  common  vocabulary and way of speaking about it.    You’ll  find  that  a  common  vocabulary  will  help  in  a  number  of  ways,  from  making  brainstorms  more  effective  to  making  debate  over  product  and  design  decisions  even  more rich because you’ll have a shorthand for the things that are most important to the  discussion.  Seemingly simple questions that can get asked over and over again, “How do  we know X?”, “How are we going to measure Y?”, “How do you expect the majority of  users will react?”, “What is the learning curve for this?”, “What user errors or stumbling  blocks  do  we  think  are  reasonable  or  not?”,  “What  do  you  expect  to  learn  about  user  behavior from this design?”, “What does design success look like?”, “What does design  failure look like?” can quickly help to train people and set expectations about the role that  data can play in decision making and in strategic, grounded design iteration.     Remember  though,  this  should  be  as  much  about  having  common  definitions  as  it  is  about  having  a  common  vocabulary.    Since  a  data  informed  environment  requires  a  certain  amount  of  discipline  and  rigor  to  the  practice,  you  can’t  ensure  consistent  application of this framework if you don’t also have alignment on your definitions as well  as  your  vocabulary.    Don’t  get  too  caught  up  in  the  words  and  acronyms   especially  around metrics  such that you forget that the ultimate goal is to provide the best, the most  compelling experience for your users. Find ways to actively represent the user in your  definitions so that everyone recognizes that data itself does not humanize but it’s how we  interpret it and how it is applied and used to rationalize decisions about product design  and product quality that can be dehumanizing.  Key phrases and vocabulary for a data-aware approach have been defined throughout the  book, and these include terms like:    cid:120   Design Space   cid:120   Hypothesis  -  by  stating  “my  hypothesis  is...”  it  helps  to  place  your  idea  within  the  context  of  everyone  else’s  ideas.    Calling  it  a  “hypothesis”  reminds  you  that  it  hasn’t  been  proven  yet  and  that  it  needs  to  be  tested.   Hypothesis also has the added benefit of sounding more scientific, making  people less attached to their ideas and therefore more open to testing them  and being proven wrong.    cid:120   Statistically significant - a great shorthand for knowing whether or not you  should  act  on  the  results  from  your  test.    You  can  always  refer  back  to  whether or not the results were “statistically significant”.    cid:120   Variables   cid:120   Measures      6     cid:120   Metrics -  We’ve spent some time in this book pointing you to the fact that  the right user  rather than business bottom-line  metrics for your company  need  to  be  designed.  We  have  also  spent  some  time  identifying  the  difference between core, proxy and secondary metrics.  For the purpose of  this section, “metrics” is a key part of the data informed vocabulary because  the metrics that you use and measure represents how you measure success.   Clear understanding and agreement on how you are defining metrics  at the  company  level  and  at  the  project  level   will  ultimately  be  an  indicator  of  how aligned you are on any given project or discussion and can therefore  play a significant role in how effective your discussions are.   You might  find that you start to use questions like “is this change really going to move  the metrics?” to ask if you’re really investing your time into a project that  will  have  a  measurable  impact  on  your  users.      Questions  like  “which  metrics  do  you  think  this  will  affect?”  can  help  you  to  make  sure  you’re  looking to impact the right level of user behavior.    cid:120   Validity   cid:120   Reliability   cid:120   Soundness   cid:120   Replication reproduceable   cid:120   Confound   cid:120   Certainty   cid:120   Ecological validity     In reality, the vocabulary itself may not be as important, it’s really more about consistent  usage of this vocabulary that helps to reinforce a specific mindset and a way of thinking.   Like working in any company, the vocabulary can help to shape the culture. What are the  words that are already part of your company culture that you can adopt to support a data  informed approach?              Principles 3 and 4   Create  alignment,  and  locate  and  establish  allies  and  co-partners  across  company function and build a team through strategic hiring to reflect, amplify  and grow the above…   People  matter.  Look  inside  your  company,  seek  out  sympathetic  and  curious  others,   recruit  allies  through  conversation,  question  asking  and  engaging  in  their  processes.  Invite  colleagues  to  be  pilots  for  studies  and  to  comment  on  designs  and  plans.  Small   “pilot groups” are invaluable. If your company or organization has not been data aware  historically, and or has engaged in a data informed design practice before, you’re likely  to find that there are some folks who are eager to try something new and others who will  have more resistance to it or not want to be bothered with the hassle of adopting a new      7    practice.  Generally, finding a few allies who are willing to try something out with you  and who are also going to be more forgiving in the initial stages when you are likely to  make a lot of mistakes can be really helpful.  This will give you a chance to work out any  kinks  in  the  process  with  a  small  group  of  supportive  people  and  then  have  more  confidence as you try to roll it out to other designers or teams.    To  find  a  good  “pilot”  project,  there  are  a  couple  of  characteristics  to  consider.    Find  something small so that you can ideally get a “quick win” and share the positive results of  using data informed design to others.   If the first project you pick to use data informed  design takes you a few months just to establish what data you’re looking for or to do the  analysis on the results, it’s very unlikely that you’ll get a lot of enthusiasm from others to  adopt something new.  Find a project which has well defined success metrics.  This will  make it easier for you to explain what you’ve learned or not by applying a data informed  process.  A project that allows you to do a couple of quick iterations can also be good  because it can demonstrate a data informed process over a couple of cycles.   We really  try  to  encourage  using  data  to  do  more  than  “just  optimization”  but  when  you’re  establishing  the  practice  for  the  first  time  –  these  kinds  of  projects  are  perfect  for  warming up the larger organization to the concept of data informed design and to build  confidence in adopting a new framework for design.   Finally a note on “allies”.  As mentioned above, some people will be naturally drawn to a  data informed approach and others will not. The best allies exist in other teams. Having  many different voices who can advocate for a data informed process is very powerful.   Some  of  the  best  advocates  are  in  analytics  teams  and  in  marketing.    Seeking  support  from  the  broader  organization  helps  to  make  this  more  than  “just  a  design  thing”  and  helps  to  elevate  it  to  the  level  of  a  company  wide  initiative.    This  also  helps  with  the  “universally accepted” aspect of culture we discussed earlier.            In  addition  to  gaining  internal  allies  and  collaborators,  new  people  matter.  The  people  you  hire  play  a  huge  role  in  the  success  of  your  team.    Building  a  team  to  work  effectively with data informed design requires hiring a certain kind of profile.  There are  several qualities that are central to creating a strong team to drive a data aware design  team and a data informed design practice in your organization:     1.   fundamental design skills – the best designers know how to interpret a difficult  problem  and  create  a  solution  that  addresses  it.    They  can  also  articulate  and  justify the reasoning behind their design decisions.  It’s no different working in a  data aware environment.  The best designers in a data aware environment will  leverage these fundamental design skills to address and articulate user problems  and needs that will often be identified and measured using data.    2.  a passion for driving a successful business that is also consumer user-centered.  Ideally the people you hire will have a passion and curiosity about the business  you’re  in.  To  build  a  data  aware  design  environment,  it  becomes  even  more  important  for  people  to  have  a  certain  level  of  business  passion  and  desire  to  contribute  to  strategic  thinking  about  the  business.    This  is  because  it  all  ties  back  to  being  able  to  create  hypotheses  that  have  the  intent  of  moving  the  measures  metrics  you  use  to  measure  your  business  by.    If  the  designers  and      8    3.   product  managers  who  are  tasked  with  building  the  business  solutions  don’t  have  a  baseline  level  of  passion  for  the  business  bottom-line  measures  and  metrics, if they are happier being tasked and “throwing designs over the wall”,  then they will be unhappy in the environment you are creating.   an  affinity  for  understanding,  generalizing  and  being  able  to  replicate  design  success and drive consistent user centered design and product excellence.  Being  programmatic  and  systematic  through  data  is  about  understanding  and  being  able to derive general principles and being able to replicate your results and to  derive  general  principles.  Even  if  results  cannot  be  replicated  for  good  data  reasons,  it  is  important  that  general  principles  are  extracted  that  could  be  applicable to adjacent or downstream projects.   4.  a desire to engage with and learn about the scientific method and develop some  skill or affinity for mathematics. It is true that having some basic understanding  of  statistics  and  analysis  can  make  a  big  difference  in  whether  or  not  an  individual can succeed in a data-aware design environment.  You don’t need to  be great at it, but it’s important to have some basic level of math is just so that  you  can have conversations  with  the  folks  that  are  doing  the  analysis  of  your  work.  You need to be able to question how the success of your work is being  measured  and  you  need  to  have  an  appreciation  for  it.    Without  some  fundamental  understanding  of  the  theory  behind  many  of  the  techniques  in  a  data informed environment, you won’t be able to engage in the more strategic  conversations.   5.  an ability to be open-minded, iterative and engaged but not enslaved by initial  design inspirations. There are many kinds of designers that exist in companies  and all types of designers can be successful in their careers. For some designers,  a healthy ego and a deep belief in the fundamental “rightness” of their designs is  a  necessary  and  positive  characteristic  as  it  can  sometimes  give  designers  the  confidence and ability to convince others of their vision and to sell them on that.  Ego  is  a  necessary  component  for  creativity  to  survive.    In  a  data  aware,  experimental, iterative design environment, over attachment to designs that can  result from ego can get in the way of success.  This is because as part of a data  informed organization you often have to be willing to let the user and usage data  make the decisions. Just as the common phrase applied to authors – that they  have to be the “murderers of their children” – may be true, the same is true for  designers. Letting go can be hard but may be necessary.    6.  an ability to be very focused on results as well as production. Especially in the  AB  testing  part  of  data  informed  design,  it  can  be  easy  to  get  distracted  with  different options and test cells and variations.  By having a certain amount of  focus and discipline, your staff will be better equipped to resist the urge to fall  into  the  various  pitfalls  of  AB  testing  around  making  a  decision  too  early  or  building out too many test cells.   You don’t always need to hire people who have actually had experience in doing data  informed design, but you at least need to find people that seem to have an affinity for  working within that framework.  If the folks that you hire aren’t fundamentally open to  the  concept  of  data  driven  design  then  it  can  make  it  very  difficult  for  them  to  be  successful in the team.  This of course doesn’t mean that they are “bad” designers, it just  means that they would probably be more effective  and more appreciated by their peers   in a different environment.  As we mention throughout the book, there are many ways to      9    do design and to build product.  What fundamentally determines the success of design or  product  is  finding  the  right  fit  between  the  individuals,  organization  and  the  processes  that you use to get there.                   Principle 5    cid:120   Articulate the long term benefits and the ability to do effective pattern finding  across different kinds of data set by establishing a disciplined and consistent  approach to leveraging data that is programmatic, flexible and not rigid …..by  One  of  the  aspects  of  creating  a  shared  culture  around  user  centered  data  is  to  be  programmatic  about  your  data  collection  and  sharing.  What  does  this  mean?  We  have  already talked about crafting a careful and consistent. Beyond this though you need to  create  a  framework  for  sharing  results.  The  more  you  can  create  a  set  of  data  sharing  formats and practices the more people will sign up. For example, create a consistent look  and feel to your reports. Create a carefully managed repository of reports where people  can  seek  information  as  they  need  it.    Create  a  rhythm  for  data  sharing.  Use  physical  space to showcase results as they come in.  Create what social scientist Nina Wakeford  calls  “atmospheres”  around  the  presentation  of  your  data  so  that  you  can  help  others  understand  and  interpret  their  significance,  and  so  that  they  can  work  to  make  the  connection to what the data suggest are actionable next steps. By careful management of  results over time you can avoid ephemerality and you can avoid the constant redoing of  work and the constant “reinvention of the wheel”. Systematic record keeping and sharing  in  common  formats  makes  your  message  potential  stronger,  and  makes  the  business  stronger. We advocate putting considerable effort into your  “data hygeine”.   Revisiting Data  One of the main reasons people consider adopting a data informed design approach is that  it can save you a lot of time in learning something about your product before you release  it. You can learn a lot from past internal examples as well as by looking externally at  what other companies are sharing about their learnings.    As  data  informed  design  is  becoming  an  established  process,  we’ve  found  that  an  effective technique is to take past projects and then retrospectively look at the data using  a data informed framework.  Of course this may not always be possible, because you may  not have had all the proper tracking in place but many times the basic metrics will be  tracked  and  available.    You  can  look  at  old  projects  and  see  if  there  was  any  way  of  looking at the data ahead of time that might have affected the decisions you made on the  project.  Often the data is available to but the team just wasn’t considering it.    This might be especially effective on projects where the outcome wasn’t what you were  expecting.  For example, was there a project where you were hoping to see a big lift in  acquisition and it didn’t happen?   Going back to the data, was there anything you could  have looked at prior to making those changes that might have given you a hint as to the  fact that it wasn’t going to be successful?  How can you build that knowledge into future  tests?    Or perhaps your users reacted very badly to a new feature you launched but really      10    thought  was  going  to  make  them  happy…  applying  some  survey  techniques  or  user  research in these instances  even though the feature has already been launched  will give  you insight into what your users might have been able to tell you ahead of time if you had  done this work pre-launch.  When you can share these kind of insights back to the team   even  if  it  does  feel  “too  late”   it  makes  people  that  much  more  enthusiastic  to  incorporate a data informed approach earlier in the process the next time.  Another best practice which is especially effective with respect to AB testing is to keep  track of which cells you  and your team  think will “win” and then comparing it to what  actually happens.  To cast your “vote” ahead of launching a test, ask all the members of  the  team  to  write  down  what  they  think  the  results  will  be  and  why  they  think  those  results will happen.  When you get the actual results and can compare it with the votes  that were cast prior to the test being launched then it gives you a chance to see how well  you and your team were actually able to predict the impact to users.    Over time, it’s always interesting to keep track of who in the team has the “best” product  instincts.    There’s  of  course  a  danger  in  this  tactic  in  that  it  can  create  a  competitive  environment, but the trick is to make it more about learning together and keeping each  other honest.     Developing a rhythm around data sharing  Finally you might find that there are some very easy ways to set up a rhythm around data.  There may be other things that you can look to piggy back on to set up an expectation  within your team about good habits that you can make part of a recurring rhythm.      For example, rather than setting up user research as needed, you could set up a monthly  user research session which either focuses on your baseline experience or that gets filled  with whatever happens to be going on that week.  You might also consider sending out a  monthly  update  with  insights  from  the  various  projects  that  you’ve  been  doing.    By  starting to set up expectations that data will be collected on a regular basis or looking to  create dashboards that show how metrics might be changing over time given changes that  you  are  making  to  the  product,  you  can  start  to  establish  a  working  rhythm  in  your  organization around data.             As you begin applying a data informed framework, there’s no way to just turn it “on” so  you’ll start with selectively.  However, your goal should be to make data aware design a  consistent  part  of  product  development.  To  do  that,  it  will  require  discipline  and  vigilance.  This is probably true of any decision-making platform, but if you’re going to  take  a  data  informed  approach  to  product  and  design  it’s  important  to  not  apply  this  framework selectively.    Fundamentally,  taking  a  data  informed  approach  to  design  is  about  trying  to  make  decisions  about  your  product  and  for  your  customers  using  as  much  information  as  possible along the way.  It’s about trying to mitigate the  subjective aspects of product  development by incorporating data from your customers into the process.  It’s therefore  almost inherent to the nature of a data informed design process that you need to apply it      11    consistently across all projects for it to work.  We’ve seen that using data inconsistently  within an organization can often cause confusion or skepticism about the larger process.    One of the critiques that we’ve heard about using data inconsistently is that the data is  only used when it supports the opinion of the person who’s making the decision.   This  can definitely happen in organizations and as many of us might know from lab courses in  college or high school, there are often ways to “fudge” the data or read it in a way that  makes it support the outcome you’re looking for.  As you’re trying to establish the value  of data informed design, it’s even more critical that they way you leverage and interpret  data is such that it reinforces the objective value that it brings.  As a designer or product  manager  working  in  this  environment,  you  might  find  that  there  can  be  a  dose  of  skepticism around which cells are being tested and why.  Therefore, it becomes important  to treat all projects with the same amount of rigor across the board.  Crafting solutions  and making decisions in absence of data and user feedback should become the exception  and when you do make those decisions without testing or user feedback you’ll want to be  able to articulate and defend why that was the case.    Especially when you are trying to establish the methodology of data informed design, it  can  be  important  to  showing  how  you  consistently  hold  yourself  accountable  to  the  methodology  of data  informed  design,  but  ask  others  to hold  you  accountable  as  well.   This goes back to the first two points about having data informed design be universally  embraced and having a common vocabulary.  If you have those two things in place, then  your whole company will be helping to keep you and your team accountable as well.    Principle  6    cid:120   Create  a  learning  organization  to  ensure  you  perennially  grow  your   knowledge base.   Data  aware  design  environments  work  best  when  they  are  seen  as  part  of  an  overall  company  culture  that  encourages  learning.    Many  companies  are  focusing  on  creating  “learning environments” where there is a focus on building individual skills as well as  encouraging development. Data aware design lends itself to this environment because one  of the core attitudes that you need to have about using a data informed framework is to  recognize  that  you  are  constantly  trying  to  build  up  and  add  to  your  knowledge  about  your  customer’s  behavior.  Using  a  data  informed  approach  is  fundamentally  about  “honing  your  consumer  instinct”.    This  is  an  ongoing  activity  and  every  project  is  an  opportunity  to  get  better  at  developing  that  instinct  through  learning,  information  and  data.  There are some very practical habits and best practices that can really help to support this  culture.  Some things that we’ve seen be especially effective are:    cid:120   Sharing results and information broadly   cid:120   Keeping sharp on both theory and practice   cid:120   Self awareness evaluation   Share broadly  If you are actively using a data informed design framework, one of the best things that  you can do for your company is to broadly share the results and to give everyone access      12    to  the  data.    In  a  data  informed  environment  it  becomes  even  more  important  that  designers understand how their designs are being judged and performing. Designers are  often very engaged with user research  which we also classify or include as part of the  “data  informed” framework because  the design  is  still  in progress  and  user research  is  often  more  integrated  into  the  design  process . However,  there  are  many  places  where  once the design is done, the designer disengages from the product development process  and doesn’t stay as engaged with the results post launch.  Designers need to get the results from any AB tests that are conducted over their designs.  Getting  access  to  this  data  is  a  key  shift  in  their  ability  to  become  more  strategic.   Understanding  even if only at a high level  how to analyze this data and how to then use  that data to make informed decisions about what to design  and test  next is a key skill.    Habitual  sharing context  setting broad  communication,  company-wide,  of  test  results  -  reinforces  that  most  decisions  are  influenced  by  data.    It  also  helps  folks  to  build  up  shared  knowledge  about  what  works  and  what  doesn’t  work.    All  this  testing  doesn’t  really get you much further if you’re only using it to make decisions on a micro level.   What  should be  happening  is  really  taking  away  learning  from  these  smaller  instances  and then using them to hone your instincts about your users over time.  The best way to  do this is to vet it with your peers and to subject your testing to debate and discussion.   Theory and practice  It  is  useful  not  only  to  share  the  results  of  ongoing  work,  but  to  also  recognize  that  operating in a data informed environment can be new for a number of people.  Sharing  results from ongoing work means that you’re sharing knowledge and insights which helps  people  develop  a  better  understanding  when  it  comes  to  your  particular  product  or  project, but it can also be helpful to make sure that people who have less experience with  data informed design have an opportunity to build a good foundation about the practice  itself.      Discussions and debate around more general topics and “theory” of data informed design  can be very helpful to make sure that everyone has a common foundation.  Topics might  include everything from how to pick the right technique for different kinds of projects,  the pros and cons of different methodologies, or even details on how to pick a statistically  significant cell size or what a p-value is.  The number and level of discussions that you  have on these best practices will be determined by how mature the organization is with  respect to data informed design.   If everyone can have a common baseline of knowledge  on  the  theory  behind  the  practice  of  data  informed  design  you’ll  find  that  your  discussions on actual projects will be much richer and much more efficient.  You’ll also  hopefully avoid some of the pitfalls of not using the data properly  and therefore being  more likely to subjective or mis-interpretation .   You’ll find plenty of potential topics for  these “theory” discussions from some of the earlier chapters in this book.   Self awareness evaluation  As we’ve mentioned before, one of the biggest benefits of a data informed approach to  design is that it gives you a great tool to use to hone your consumer instinct over time.  If  part of the culture of data informed design is about transparency and a more objective  evaluation  of  your  work  via  the  data  then  as  we’ve  hinted  before  accountability  to  holding  everyone  to  a  similar  standard  is  important.  It’s  really  helpful  to  create  an  environment  where  you  can  encourage  self-evaluation  and  to  not  be  afraid  of  making      13    mistakes and building out ideas that don’t actually “move the needle”, that is positively  impact the business bottom line by increasing one of the established success metrics  e.g.  user retention or engagement, revenue, etc … so long as you are keeping track of them  and then learning from those experiences.     We’ve discussed keeping track of track records as a good way to see how you’re actually  doing.  Being self aware of when your instinct has differed from what has been reflected  in the data is one of the fastest ways of improving and if you’re in a culture where sharing  data and results is very common, then you should have a lot of tools available for you to  evaluate yourself.  In the next chapter we will address some of the pitfalls of being in a  data  informed  environment  if  you DON’T hold  yourself accountable  to  your decisions  and if you don’t do this constant self evaluation. For example, “over-testing” can actually  be a side effect of not having a strong enough instinct for what are the right things to test.   Developing  a  good  instinct  for  what  will  give  you  the  best  return  on  your  resources  investment  your “ROI”  will actually come from constant viligence and self-evaluation  as to how well your team is operating and how well your instincts are validated by data.   Not only should this be applied to the individual, but to the organization overall and it’s  best  if  you  can  explicitly  think  about  fine  tuning  and  improving  your  collective  understanding about your customers.     Ongoing education and establishing a rhythm around data  As  we’ve  mentioned  before,  creating  an  environment  where  it’s  clear  that  ongoing  learning  is  supported  can  be  one  of  the  most  effective  tools  to  getting  traction  for  a  framework  like  data  informed  design.  This  is  best  done  through  a  series  of  ongoing  meetings, forums and occasional talks.     Lectures – this might be more applicable to larger teams - introducing a topic to a broad  audience  say a mix of tech, product and design  can be an effective way to plant some of  the seeds of data informed design with that group.  Lectures are good for:   Introduction of company wide metrics    cid:120    cid:120   Overview of best practices and introduction to data informed design processes   cid:120   Overview of different methods and techniques and when to use them   However,  lectures  can’t  be  the  only  means  of  introducing  a  new  framework  to  an  organization.    Lectures  are  ofen  most  useful  for  offering  an  introduction  or  overview.  Follow-up  discussions  with  active  project  teams  at  the  right  time  in  their  process  are  essential. So, while it’s good to use an all-hands or team meeting to talk about the ways  that you might leverage early stage user research, it won’t really feel concrete or useful  until  you  can  find  a  team  that  is  actually  at  a  stage  in  their  project  where  they  can  leverage early stage research and speak directly to what techniques make sense for them  at that point in time.   Project review meetings  One of the most effective meetings for sharing knowledge is a recurring project review  meeting. This might be an ongoing meeting between a broad set of product managers and  designers to review a number of topics around ongoing work.  The key is when you invite  people that may not normally work day-to-day with each other. Such meetings provide an  opportunity  to  share  what  they  are  learning  in  each  of  their  areas  to  the  broader  organization and it helps generally with building up that shared knowledge base of what      14    is working and what doesn’t work when it comes to your users. You might break this  meeting into two sections:   1   Ongoing or upcoming work  2   Results from launched projects   The meeting should encourage a lot of discussion and debate about the projects that are  being shared and it should feel more like a working meeting where everyone is vetting  what is being presented.  Presenters should leave the room feeling more confident about  the approach that they are taking and perhaps have some new insights as well. To get you  started here are some of the kinds of things you might present and discuss.   On ongoing or upcoming projects your discussion might include the following:    cid:120   Hypothesis   o  What is the hypothesis?   o  Background  for  what  generated  work data research that influenced it.   the  hypothesis  and  any  prior    cid:120   Success metrics     cid:120   Methodology   o  Does  it  resonate  and  contribute  to  the  overall  product  goals?  More   specifically, is the hypothesis valid?   o  What are the success metrics? How were they derived?  o  Are  they  right  ones?  Will  these  really  measure  the  validity  of  the   hypothesis?   o  What other things might you measure or use to measure success?    o  What  techniques  are  you  using  to  collect  data  for  this  project?     e.g.   user research, AB testing, etc.     o  What do you hope to learn?    o  Are  there  other  methods  that  could  reveal  better  data?  Would  some   form of data triangulation give you deeper insights?   o  To  what  extent  were  methods  chosen  as  a  result  of  extraneous   constraints  e.g., time constraints ?   o  Given an infinite amount of time, what would the ideal method s  be?   o  How effective is the design at reflecting the hypothesis or variations of   that hypothesis?   o  How does the design support what you want to learn from this project?   cid:131   Note:    This  meeting  will  be  different  from  a  design  review  where you might be looking at consistency within your design  language, etc.  and giving more pure design feedback.  Those  meetings are still useful, but probably a separate meeting from  this one.    cid:120   Design       15    For projects that have launched and where you are reviewing results, discussion might  revolve around the following:    cid:120   Summary of methodology   o  What  methods  were  used  and  why?  What  other  methods  were   considered? Why were they not selected?    o  How effective were the methods used at getting the insights that were   sought?     cid:120   Results and analysis   o  Was the hypothesis proven?  Why or why not?  o  What did the team learn and what can be applied to other work that is   o  Did the results support any other larger trends that you might have seen   going on?   before?   o  How do these results compare to prior work?  o  What are the next steps?     By reviewing the work that is done in this manner on a regular basis, people can actively  learn about what works and doesn’t work. It also encourages people to ask questions and  discuss,  thereby  learning  together  and  actively  learning  while  doing.  When  the  organization is newer to data informed design, having a meeting like this is a good way  for the few who might be more comfortable with the concepts to teach those who are less  familiar. When the organization is more mature at using data informed methodologies,  then  the  discussion  can  stimulate  further  learning  and  perhaps  even  innovation  in  methods and analyses.  We advocate subscribing to user testing and design related blogs and services, and doing  regular  searched  for  slide-decks  and  white  papers  online.  Although  results  fro  other  companies may not always be transferrable to your company, garnering an understanding  of what other companies have learned can be a good way to stimulate creative ways to  look at your own product s  and your own practices. Looking to what may already be  written  or  shared  can  be  a  great  way  to  pre-inform  or  to  accelerate  acceptance  for  adopting a data informed design process in your company. For example, you might be  considering creating a side navigation system, but an article from Next Web suggests side  drawer navigation reduces user engagement. 2 Sharing this data back to your team should  could motivate running a test on your own navigational system.    Through these techniques you can establish your own internal process of data informed  design  and  ultimately  build  up  your  own  knowledge  base  of  things  that  work  best  for  your company and your product.                                                                 2  engagement    http:  thenextweb.com dd 2014 04 08 ux-designers-side-drawer-navigation-costing-half-user-     16    Conclusions Questions to ask yourself  As you set this up, we also advocate you think through:    cid:120   What are the things that will be challenges for you as an individual to change?    cid:120   What are some of the things that will be challenging for your organization or   team in a move to a more data aware approach to design?       cid:120   How does your organization currently communicate?   o  Who initiates user testing?  o  Who “owns” the results?    cid:120   Who do you already have in your organization that might prove helpful for you   to pair with as you try to establish these practices?    cid:120   What resources including skills do you and your team currently have in place   and what do you need to acquire, create and or develop?    cid:120   What existing habits and cultural aspects are already in place that might make a  good  foundation  upon  which  to  build  a  culture  of  data  informed  design  and  decision making?   As we mentioned when we started this chapter, culture is really something that is unique  to every organization and we would never dictate what the right solution might be for  you.  You may want to take some of the practical things we’ve suggested and put them in  place right away. You will find that some of them will work well and endure, whereas  others will not get traction or will require considerable perseverance to establish.    In  keeping  with  our  theme  of  data  aware  design,  we’ve  always  taken  an  experimental  approach to organizational processes too. We advise you to do the same. Try things out  get  feedback  from  “users”   which  may  mean  teams   as  to  which  things  are  effective,  valuable and valued and for what reasons, and which are not.  See if you can create ways  to  measure  your  success,  to  measure  what  works  and  why.  In  the  case  of  a  cultural  transformation, these measures will not be as clear cut as a simple data pull of the number  of users on your site to reflect “retention” or “acquisition”, but you can find other ways to  measure  your  success.  Ask  yourself:  How  well  has  your  “common  vocabulary”  taken  hold?  Are  people  using  the  terms  you  have  introduced  in  meetings  and  in  company  correspondence in email, messaging and announcements? Are people actively asking to  bring data into the design and product development cycle? Has your time spent “selling”  the  idea  reduced?  Are  your  outreach  activities  meeting  with  more  positive  responses?  How much does data informed design get attributed for the success of your product and  how much is it referred to by other organizations in your company?  Throughout this book we emphasise patience, persistence, resilience and tenacity. It will  take a while  to see the fruits of your labor paying off  or not .  It can take anywhere  upwards of 6 months to really see a change in the mindset of an organization take effect.  The  length  of  time  depends  on  the  organization  and  the  business  you  are  in.  It  will  depend on the size of the organization. Aim for some small successes to start and build  from  those.  Establish,  share  and  monitor  your  success  metrics.  With  time,  iteration  specification and allies, you’ll find that data informed design really does have a positive  effect not just on how you build your products, but on your culture as well.      17    Summary  If  you  really  want  to  be  effective  at  integrating  any  kind  of  framework  into  your  company,  you’ll  want  it  in  your  DNA Culture.    It’s  a  hundred  times  easier  to  adopt  something when the culture supports it … and that’s why the success of a data informed  framework is really going to depend on the culture at your company.  If  you’re  interested  enough  in  creating  a  lasting  and  deep  culture  around  using  a  data  aware  framework  for  design  in  your  organization  so  you  can  make  grounded,  user- centered product decisions, you’ll also invest some time in building up a culture which  can support it with the right processes as well as the right people. Even if your company  has the mechanics in place to embrace data as part of the decision making process, it’s  equally important that you have a culture that supports it as well. With respect to data,  there are a handful of tactics that we’ve seen work really well at different companies and  that are really important have as part of the company DNA. Some of these tactics apply  to  carving  out  or  transforming  individual  roles  and  responsibilities,  some  are  more  directed at establishing collaborations and support from recruiting groups and teams.  We advocate the following to make this possible:    cid:120   Aim  for  shared  understanding  of  the  value  of  user  centered  as  a  company   universal… which requires you to     cid:120   Lay the foundations for engaged and transparent conversations about systematic  data collection. You need to  create a dialogue, set expectations and develop a  common vocabulary ….in order to….     cid:120   Create  alignment,  and  locate  and  establish  allies  and  co-partners  across    cid:120   Build  a  team  through  strategic  hiring  to  reflect,  amplify  and  grow  the   company functions….and….   above…..and    cid:120   Articulate the long term benefits and the ability to do effective pattern finding  across different kinds of data set by establishing a disciplined and consistent  approach to leveraging data that is programmatic, flexible and not rigid …..by  Creating  a  learning  organization  to  ensure  you  perennially  grow  your  knowledge base.     In the next chapter, we will turn to some pitfalls of uncritically overinvesting your faith  in a data driven approach. Part of being data informed and data aware is knowing what  can go horribly wrong.

If the team members haven’t  already met one another, then this is the time when everyone will get acquainted.  Getting to know each other helps to develop empathy, which is a cornerstone of any  design-thinking exercise. In this chapter, we’ll give you tools and exercises to help  break the ice and inject a little fun into the process. These exercises will also help you  get inspired. Whether you need to be inspired by facts or out-of-the-box ideas, we’ve  included a collection of tools to get you there. Together you’ll answer the questions:  “Who is the customer, who is the user, and what are their problems?” You’ll all share  the relevant context so the answers to these questions can be understood clearly, but  you won’t need to come up with solutions yet.   DESIGN  SPRINT  73   What Happens During the Understand Phase?  Get the Background   Get Inspired   Deﬁne the Problem   Know the User    ~1.5 hours ~1.5 hour ~1 hour ~3 hours   As discussed in Chapter 4, a design sprint is a ﬂexible framework, and you’ll   need to adapt it to your particular situation. If the conversation requires it,  exercises can be added, reordered, skipped, shortened, or extended. Your  mileage may vary on the duration for each of the exercises; we’ve done journey maps  in 15 minutes, and some have taken up to three hours. It all depends on the level of  detail your project needs.    Whatever you do, don’t forget to take frequent breaks and get a good lunch!  Yum.   You might not ﬁnish these exercises by the end of the ﬁrst day. In that case, do the  retrospective at the end of the day, then continue the exercises on the second day. If  that happens, be sensitive to the time constraints to ﬁnish up the background work  so that you have enough time for the additional phases of the design sprint.  74 DESIGN  SPRINT   Recommended Agenda  Get the Background  Introductions  Introduce the Idea Parking Lot  Review Agenda  Rules of the Design Sprint   Pitch Practice 1  Review Research and Past Work   Get Inspired  ~15 minutes ~ 5 minutes ~ 5 minutes ~ 5 minutes ~10 minutes ~60 minutes  Goals and Anti-Goals  ~30 minutes Existing Product, Competitors, and Substitutes  ~40 minutes ~20 minutes Facts and Assumptions  Question Formulation Technique  ~15 minutes  optional   Problem Statement  Reframe the Problem with Challenge Maps   ~30 minutes ~30 minutes  optional   Deﬁne the Problem   Know the User   Who-Do  Personas   Customer Interviews   User Journey Map   Wrap-up  Daily Retrospective  Team Drinks   ~10 minutes ~45 minutes ~60 minutes ~60 minutes  ~15 minutes ~60 to 90 minutes  optional   DESIGN  SPRINT  75   Get the Background  The goal for this part of the day is to understand all the relevant data and information on hand. The team should explore  what they know and what they don’t know to gauge what knowledge gaps exist for the problem. You’ll cover existing  research done before the design sprint and review analysis of competitive or similar product offerings.  Introductions  Give the design sprint team the opportunity to intro- duce themselves. Everyone should say their name and  their role in the design sprint team and the project to  follow. The facilitator can go ﬁrst to set the stage and  provide a good example, followed by the main prod- uct sponsor or stakeholder, followed by the rest of the  team going around in a circle.   Depending on how familiar the team members are with  each other you could include an icebreaker to get the  team to open up and be comfortable working togeth- er. You’ll be spending an intense few days together— might as well get the edge off up front!  How 1.  Select  your  icebreaker  from  the  list  on  the  next  page  or  another  you  know  how  to  do   already.  2.  Describe your icebreaker to the group.  3.  Blueprint it by going ﬁrst to set the stage and give   an example for everyone.  4.  Pick an order and go around the room and make   sure that each person completes the icebreaker.  Difﬁculty: Easy Size: The whole group Materials: 5 × 7 index cards to fold   Don’t let someone talk for a long time. This is a time  for  simple  introductions,  not  for  people  to  drone  on  about their background and opinions   Approximate time: 30 to 60 seconds per participant  76 DESIGN  SPRINT   Hopes  and  Fears:  We  learned  about  this  one  from  Karen Cross at Atlassian. She uses this to help bring out  potential project issues, in addition to getting others to  know one another:   “It’s  basically  a  20-minute  brainstorm  exercise  at  the  very beginning of a sprint. Everyone sits, and has two  colored  Post-its   usually  red  and  blue .  Depending  on  the number of people involved, I usually limit them to  maybe three hopes and two fears, two hopes, or may- be  one  hope.  And  then  everyone  writes  them  down,  and they all put them face down in the middle of the  table, and then they draw from them, and then have  to read someone else’s and explain what they think it  means. By doing that, it gets them to be empathetic [to  one another].”  After  the  introductions,  acknowledge  the  others  in- volved with the project but not participating in the de- sign sprint.  A Few of Our Favorite Icebreakers  Word Ball: Bring a plush ball. Toss the ball to someone  else  in  the  room,  and  as  you  throw  it,  say  a  random  word. Each person does the same thing in turn, until  everyone’s had a chance to throw the ball.   What Neighborhood Do You Live In?: Great for peo- ple in cities who love to talk about their ’hoods. At the  end of each person’s intro, each person says the neigh- borhood they live in. One of Trace’s favorites.  Draw Your Name and Draw ______: Give each par- ticipant  an  index  card  and  ask  them  to  fold  them  in  half:  on  one  side,  they  should  write  their  names  in  a  decorative font, and something tangential and or relat- ed to the topic of the week. For example, at a recent  sprint,  C.  Todd  asked  everyone  present  to  draw  how  they’d  make  pancakes.  The  manager  present  drew  a  car  and  an  International  House  of  Pancakes  sign   he  liked their blueberry syrup .   Little-Known  Fact:  Ask  participants  to  state  their  name,  title,  and or  function,  then  add  a  fact  that  no  one in the room likely knows about them.  DESIGN  SPRINT  77   Introduce the Idea Parking Lot  Review Agenda  There’s  a  lot  to  cover  on  the  ﬁrst  day  of  the  design  sprint.  Give  the  team  a  sense  of  what’s  to  come,  so  they know what to expect.  How 1.  Review  the  printed  agenda,  or  bring  it  up  on  a   2.   large TV screen. In  about  a  sentence  each,  describe  the  exercises  you’ll be doing.  Difﬁculty: Easy Size: The whole group Materials: A printed agenda  or a large TV screen   After that, introduce the concept of the Idea Parking  Lot. During the sessions, the team may generate ideas  or have other “aha” moments that may not apply to  the main topic, or they may propose solutions on the  ﬁrst  day  that  shouldn’t  be  explored  until  the  Diverge  phase. An Idea Parking Lot is a place where such ideas  and topics can be captured, so you can come back to  them when you’re ready. Unlike a real parking lot  es- pecially during the holidays , there’s always room in the  Idea Parking Lot!  How 1.  Place a large piece of paper on the wall. A page   from a Post-it easel pad is ideal.   ture of a car. Drawing pictures of cars is fun.  3.  Throughout the sprint, when anyone has an idea  you  want  to  capture  that  doesn’t  ﬁt  the  sprint,  write  it  on  a  small  Post-it  and  stick  it  in  the  Idea  Parking Lot.  Difﬁculty: Easy Size: The whole group Materials: Post-its  you can also use a Google Doc or  Trello Board  Approximate time: 3–5 minutes  78 DESIGN  SPRINT  2.  Label it “Idea Parking Lot” at the top. Draw a pic-  Don’t go into too much detail.  Approximate time: 5 minutes   Rules of the Design Sprint  It might seem strange to start a creative thinking process by establishing rules. This  counterintuitive approach is often shunned by the uninitiated as being restrictive or  dampening the creative process. This couldn’t be further from the truth.   The guidelines we recommend are intended to level the playing ﬁeld for all partic- ipants.  Human  beings  are  complicated  enough  without  the  additional  pressure  of  having  to  solve  problems  while  stuck  in  a  room  full  of  peers  or  strangers  for  ﬁve  days, some of whom speak more forcefully than others. Put them all in a small space  together to understand a problem, generate solutions, and make prototypes, and it  can get downright chaotic. The humans involved in the design sprint phases are more  than just sources for ideas and hands to make things. They bring with them their own  experiences, biases, emotions, preferences, and politics. Guidelines reduce the risk  of those biases and focus the team on the customer’s problems. Our goal with these  guidelines is to get the team to fall in love with solving the problem and not with one  of their own subjective solutions.  By providing guidelines and rules for the team, you can empower the team. Again,  constraints increase creativity, and these guidelines can help. You reduce the oppor- tunity for mental fatigue and ensure that each person’s contributions will be given  attention and value.   DESIGN  SPRINT  79   One of the most important elements of a design sprint is that these are established on  day 1 or even before the design sprint begins. These are not guidelines to impose on  everyone in an authoritarian fashion—rather, ask the entire team to co-create them.  Our recommendation is to select a few from this list  or your own!  then place blank  bullet points and ask the team to help you ﬁll them in. If no one adds any to the list,  add some yourself. By adding it on the ﬂy, you’re more likely to get things moving.  Here’s a sampling of guidelines we use. What could you add to this list?  Everyone participates        Have one conversation at a time    Withhold judgment of others’ ideas    Get up and draw    Be comfortable    Be easy on people, tough on ideas    Be timely    Be present       One computer at a time    No jargon TPS reports    No HiPPOS    No “Yes, but…”  The phone stack  Everyone participates. We mean everyone. Design sprints are not for the faint of heart,  nor the introvert that struggles to speak up. Rather, design sprints are intended to encour- age participation by all, regardless of roles with the company or project team. There will be  mechanisms to allow the quiet voices in the room to be heard, and the facilitator’s role  see  Chapter 4  is important in identifying who isn’t participating and draw them out.   80 DESIGN  SPRINT   Have one conversation at a time. Have you ever been in a meeting and seen lots  of side conversations? We don’t want those in a design sprint because we believe  that all comments are valuable and want everyone to hear them. This will prevent   everyone  from  talking  over  one  another  and  prevent  she he-who-speaks-loudest- wins.  Withhold  judgment  of  others’  ideas.  This  is  increasingly  important  during  the   Diverge phase when participants are generating ideas. To bring forth an idea can be a  courageous act, and if there is harsh judgment, it can begin to erode conﬁdence and  diminish the quality of ideas. There will be mechanisms for judging ideas and bringing  the better ones forward; those are when judgment is necessary and even welcome.  So hold judgment until that time arrives.  Be comfortable. We don’t want people to feel like they have to stand up or sit down  all day, so if someone is sitting and feels the need to stand, or, if they need to leave  to go to the restroom, that’s OK. It seems almost too obvious to call out, but it does  make  a  difference  and  establishes  the  tone  of  the  sprint.  Take  frequent  breaks  so  everyone stays refreshed and brings their A-game.  Be easy on people, tough on ideas. Along the same lines as withholding judg- ment, we want people to feel like they can contribute. There’s no better way to do  that than to value what they contribute and go easy on them for doing so.   Be timely. Timeboxing helps force movement. Facilitators take note: this one is mostly  on you. Your job is to make sure the time doesn’t go over what was stated and agreed  on. If you said you’d have lunch at 12:30 p.m., make sure you’re breaking at 12:30 p.m.  Otherwise, everyone will be looking at their watches thinking “Weren’t we supposed to  break for lunch now?” and they will become disengaged. And hangry.  DESIGN  SPRINT  81   Be  present.  A  design  sprint  is  an  intense  exercise  and  many  participants  will  get  tired and distracted. Stay in the room, listen intently, and participate actively in the  conversations.  The phone stack. Who loves their mobile phones? Most people. Who also doesn’t  put them down in meetings? Most people. To keep the team focused and avoid the  inevitable buzzing phone distraction, we ask everyone to pile their phones up on top  of each other. This is known as the phone stack. The ﬁrst person to reach for the  phone might receive a small punishment, such as having to buy the next round of  coffees or drinks.  One computer at a time. Sometimes you’ll need a computer projecting on a screen  to review the agenda, instructions, or materials, but everyone else should keep their  computers away. Only one computer should be in use at a time. Unless necessary,  refrain from using your computer during the sprint. People will use the computers  to multitask and will stop paying attention to the conversation. To take notes, write  them  down  on  paper  instead.  Everyone  will  be  able  to  listen  better  when  they’re  looking at one another instead of their screens.  No jargon TPS reports. Do you know what a TPS report is? Neither do we! Keep  the  jargon  and  acronyms  to  a  minimum  so  everyone  in  the  room  understands.  If  necessary, start an acronym dictionary in the back of the room to keep track and let  everyone know what “BTKO” really means.  No HiPPOs. The Highest Paid Person’s Opinion can often trample on other people’s  ideas. Make this a rule so that a senior member doesn’t keep junior participants from  defending their own points of view.  82 DESIGN  SPRINT   No “Yes, but…” Any time the word “but” is said, it often invalidates what was said  earlier, so “yes, but...” is really a disagreement. Disagreeing is OK, but preceding that  disagreement with a “yes” can be subtly counterproductive. There will be times for  debate and disagreement in design sprints. Or instead of disagreeing, build on the  last idea by saying “Yes, and...” or “Yes, because...”   If you ever see anyone breaking these guidelines during the sprint, call them out on  it. If you violate these guidelines, call yourself out. If you are called out, admit it and  move on.   After reviewing the rules you’ll be following over the next few days, it’s time to get  started! Proceed with the following exercises to begin the design sprint itself.   DESIGN  SPRINT  83   Pitch Practice 1  The project sponsor should begin each day by walking  the design sprint team through the business opportuni- ty and market, and the problem you’re solving as they  see it.   How 1.  Have  the  project  sponsor  give  her  elevator  pitch.  Use a pitch deck if one is available. Cap it to a few  minutes.  Pitch  practice  makes  sure  that  everyone  is  aware  of  the  original  intent  of  the  sprint,  and  allows  the  proj- ect sponsor to practice and reﬁne the application’s el- evator pitch over the week. The pitch can be modiﬁed  as needed as new information, options, and decisions  come to light.  2.  Ensure  that  she  covers  the  business  opportunity,  market, and the problem the team wants to solve.  3.  Allow  quick  questions  at  the  end,  but  save  most  of the discussion for the rest of the day’s activities.  Difﬁculty: Easy Size: The whole group Materials:  The  project  sponsor’s  brain  and  her  pitch  deck if one is available  Don’t  let  the  project  sponsor  drone  on  and  on  and  on  there’s a 12-step program for that called On-and-  On-Anon .

Reviewing the  current  body  of  knowledge  together  will  help  to  get  everyone on the same page, and allow people to build  upon what has come before.  How 1.  Make  it  clear  that  what  was  done  previously  will  inform the activities during the design sprint, but  there will be an opportunity to take things in a dif- ferent direction if it’s better.  2.  Have a brief discussion of the background informa- tion or research that was sent out before the sprint. 3.  Go over any other materials or things people know   about the problem space but haven’t yet shared.  4.  Review  any  previous  initiatives,  including  applica- tions or prototypes the company has made to solve  a similar problem.   Difﬁculty: Easy Size: The whole group Materials:  Presentations  of  past  project  work   if   applicable ;  screenshots  or  walkthrough  of  product    if  existing ;  any  relevant  metrics,  perhaps  from  a   business intelligence report or marketing report  Don’t overload the team with information. Cognitive   over load is a thing. Also don’t judge or get into de- bates. There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss dif- ferent perspectives later in the day and throughout the  design sprint.  Approximate time: Up to 1 hour  Credit: The team at thoughtbot  With  the  guidelines  established  and  the  background  material covered for this sprint, the team can seek ways  of inspiration to create a fantastic product.   86 DESIGN  SPRINT   DESIGN  SPRINT  87   Get Inspired  When considering new possibilities, you will want to know where you’re starting from so you can later diverge in order  to  generate a multitude of options. Going into a project, it’s important to understand what constitutes success. Every- one on the team arrived with their own notions of what success is. Like the North Star for ships sailing in the 1700s,  understanding in detail what the goals are can help you as you search for inspiration and direction.   Goals and Anti-Goals   In this exercise, you’ll deﬁne the objectives of the proj- ect so all get on board and agree with it. This can also  help deﬁne the project’s guardrails.   How 1.  Draw  two  columns  on  a  whiteboard,  one  for  the  project’s  goals,  and  one  for  its  anti-goals.   Anti-goals are things that are explicitly not goals of  the project.  2.  Ask the team to brainstorm goals for the project.  These  should  be  high-level  objectives,  not  fea- tures. For example, “Save $75 million per year in  increased production efﬁciency” is a high-level ob- jective, but “Allow users to propose savings ideas”  is a feature.   3.  As each goal is suggested, allow the team to dis- cuss  it  and  agree  that  it’s  a  goal  for  the  design  sprint or following project. If it’s not, move it to the  anti-goals column.  4.  Ask the team to similarly brainstorm the anti-goals   that are not needed for the project’s success.  Identify the top three goals. Underline the 1 goal.  5.  6.  Capture and upload the list so the team can refer   to it later.  Difﬁculty: Easy Size: The whole group Materials: Whiteboard and markers   Don’t  list  features,  list  too  many  goals.

A com- petitor. An elegant solution to a different product you’d  like  to  emulate  in  some  way.  With  digital  products,  many solutions exist, so rather than reinvent the wheel,  seek out solutions from other industries that might ap- ply to your problem. They don’t have to ﬁt your prob- lem exactly  remember, you’re only seeking inspiration  at  this  point .  We  often  take  a  section  of  a  wall  and  print out apps, screenshots, drawings, or web pages of  things we ﬁnd inspiring, useful, or maybe even want to  replicate  or all this can be viewed online and projected  onto a screen .  There’s  a  risk  of  opening  Pandora’s  box  here,  in  that  sometimes a team can get too focused on replicating  what already exists, instead of solving what a user or  customer really needs. Don’t spend too much time on  a deep dive of each of these; stick to a broad overview.  How 1.  Sync your monitor or phone to a large TV screen.  Have someone bring up your existing site or app if  one already exists, and walk through it to give the  participants  context.  Discuss  what’s  working  well  and what’s not working well.  2.   Invite participants to identify competitive and sub- stitute products. Bring them up on the screen, or  put a printout up on the wall. Discuss the strengths  and  weaknesses  of  each.  Also  consider  what  “non-products” are used. For example, when a cus- tomer uses pencil and paper to track event participants.  3.  Do the same for aspects of apps or sites from oth- er industries. For example, an onboarding ﬂow or  data visualization you might want to replicate.    4.  Take notes on the areas that are inspiring. If you’ve  put screenshots up, have everyone stick Post-its or  dot stickers next to the areas they like the most.

It’s human to make assumptions and form biases. Just  get over it: we are biased. These biases can inﬂuence  our decisions, which will affect our ability to solve the  right problem. Before we can solve tough problems and  open new pathways, we need to escape the conﬁnes of  our existing biases, break out of our mental habits, and  call out the assumptions that we may have. Einstein fa- mously observed that “You can’t solve problems at the  same level of thinking that created them.” Pushing our  brains to identify all the assumptions we have about a  problem will unlock ways for us to try and solve it; facts  and assumptions help to reduce your bias by identifying  them.   Let’s take a simple example: “I went to the supermarket  yesterday and bought an apple because I was hungry.”  How many assumptions do you think are in that state- ment? More than you think. First, there’s an assump-  tion of causality: that being hungry causes the purchase  of an apple. We don’t know about you, but we often  look in our cupboard or refrigerator ﬁrst before going  to the store for an apple. Second, that the supermarket  has apples in it. Yes, in the United States this is com- mon, but depending on time of year and location, it is  not always true, and hence an assumption.  These same subltle assumptions and biases can haunt  you if not properly identiﬁed at the start of a project.   This exercise is used to identify what data is on hand,  what is still unknown, and most importantly, what as- sumptions the team is making. This helps to minimize  conﬁrmation bias  it never is eliminated  and baseline  everyone  in  the  room  to  understand  the  context  of  the problem at hand. This also helps to identify what  knowledge gaps exist.  92 DESIGN  SPRINT   How  1.  Allow  participants  3–10  minutes  to  individually  document  facts  and  assumptions   one  fact as- sumption per Post-it . Use one color Post-it for facts  and another color for assumptions. Invite each participant to share their assumptions  as they post them to a wall or display board.  2.   to   3.  Ask  participants   rewrite  any  successfully   challenged facts on the assumption colored Post-its. 4.  Document  questions  that  arise  during  the  group   discussion process.   5.  Ask  participants  to  approach  the  wall  or  board  of  facts and assumptions in pairs to work silently group- ing the facts and assumptions by commonality.  6.  Partway through the process, replace the catego- rizers with two new participants, allowing them to  undo or redo any work previously done; continue  to replace categorizers every few minutes until all  Post-its are categorized.  7.  Once half the Post-its are categorized, give the cat- egorizers  medium-sized  Post-its  to  add  category  headings.

It must be done before deter- mining insights.  Don’t let questionable facts go unchallenged, as they  may be assumptions  anyone can challenge a fact or an  assumption . Let the group jump to insights without a  full exploration of the facts and assumptions.  Example:  “9%  of  current  customers  use  feature  X”  is a fact; “current customers don’t understand how to  use feature X” is an assumption.

Is my idea as awesome as  I think it is?  How are users currently solving this prob- lem? What are the best ways for your organization to  solve this? A question-storming approach can be quite  helpful in understanding the problem you’re trying to  solve.  Phil  McKinney,  former  Hewlett-Packard  CTO,  made himself into a question specialist for the corpo- rate world, and argues that crafting good questions is  what allows people to make innovative breakthroughs:  “The challenge is that, as adults, we lose our curiosity  over time. We get into ruts, we become experts in our  ﬁelds  or  endeavors.”  Dan  Rothstein,  founder  of  The  Right Question Institute, studies the art and science of  asking questions.   “Wielded  with  purpose  and  care,  a  question  can  be- come a sophisticated and potent tool to expand minds,  inspire new ideas, and give us surprising power at mo- ments when we might not believe we have any.”   Dan and his cofounder Luz Santana created the Ques- tion  Formulation  Technique,  which  was  initially  made  for teachers to teach children the skill of asking ques- tions.  However,  we  have  found  that  this  also  helps  teams generate questions about the project and uncov- er some interesting opportunities.   This exercise is used to bring to the surface the ques- tions each participant has about a particular topic. This  can align teams so they all know what questions every- one has on a particular topic.  94 DESIGN  SPRINT   How 1.

By this point in the day, you know which direction to  go—you’re  feeling  inspired  and  you’re  ready  to  dig  deeper  into  the  problem.  If  someone  comes  to  you  with  a  problem,  most  people  start  thinking  about  a  solution. Hopefully the questions you’ve generated are  more about the problem and not leading to one solu- tion or another, because as soon as you start thinking  of a solution, you risk missing out on possibilities for a  deeper understanding of the problem.  a.  Ask as many questions as possible.  b.  Do not stop to answer, judge, or to discuss   c.  Write  down  every  question  exactly  as  it  is   the questions.   stated.   d.

Difﬁculty: Easy Size: Individual and group Materials:  Sharpies   and   Post-it   notes   Context This is a divergent exercise, so it is best used in the be- ginning of a sprint. It could precede or follow Facts and  Assumptions. A good follow-up exercise is to converge  onto  the  important  questions  to  answer  by  voting.   Don’t  allow  questions  to  be  answered—it  can  be  a   rat-hole in the making. Don’t let this go un-timeboxed.  DESIGN  SPRINT  95   Define the Problem   What’s the problem you’re attempting to solve? This is one of the most important  aspects and sadly, it is one that’s overlooked frequently by the many teams and cli- ents we have worked with. Since most designers and engineers are trained to design  and build things, the propensity to create and deliver often overpowers the desire to  understand why they are creating something. You can look at the copious amount  of digital products that were created and went nowhere. Let’s take a look at a few  examples you might have heard of.  Airtime, the face-to-face video chat web application that was launched on June 5,  2012  with  quite  a  splash.  Shawn  Fanning  and  Sean  Parker   the  famous  Facebook  investor , who created Napster, did a number of talk-show appearances and held a  launch party that any record company would envy, well, except for the glitches.2 The  result? $33M of funding with no users after 16 months of operation.3   What was the problem they were trying to solve for? Skype, Google Hangouts’ and  Apple’s Facetime already had been in the market to solve these needs and Airtime  offered little extra in the way of solving for another need. Had Airtime been more  focused on the problem of video chat, it could have worked toward a better solu- tion—instead they kept building and didn’t pay attention.  2   Erin Grifﬁth, “Big Celebs, Big Ideas: The Double-Edged Sword of a Big Flashy Launch,” June 5, 2012. http:  bit.ly celeb-ideas.   3  Milo Yiannopoulos, “There Is Literally No One Left on Sean Parker’s Airtime,” October 28th, 2013,  http:  bit.ly yiannopoulos.  96 DESIGN  SPRINT   Facebook Home is  or was  a mobile digital product you might have tried on your  Android device. We didn’t. Did it even make any sense? It seemed to solve a problem  for Facebook, which was keeping their users in their app, but it did not solve any real  problem or need for the user. We have seen many companies start design sprints to  solve their own problems rather than solve a problem for their users and or custom- ers.   To understand the problem you’re solving for, you need to understand what informa- tion you have on hand about the current user behavior. Now that you’ve dug into the  data and information you already have, and explored your facts, assumptions, and  questions, you’ll consider the problems your users have faced. Are there tangential  related problems? Are there seemingly unrelated problems? The objective is to paint  as complete a picture as possible to understand the context of the situation.   DESIGN  SPRINT  97   5.  Rewrite  the  problem  statement  in  a  large  format  on a whiteboard or big Post-it and keep it visible  throughout  the  sprint.  This  will  be  important  to  reﬂect and revisit if the conversation veers too far  from the established problem.   Difﬁculty: Medium Size: The whole group Materials: Whiteboard, markers, and large Post-its   Don’t write a compound problem statement that solves  all problems and tries to be all things to all people.

Approximate time: 20 minutes  Credit: The team at thoughtbot  Problem Statement  You can’t deﬁne a good solution until you understand the  problem you’re solving. Deﬁning that together gets the  team on the same page and sets it as the North Star for  the rest of the design sprint. This keeps ideas focused on  the problem at hand, and other great ideas that solve a  different problem can get added to the Idea Parking Lot.  How 1.  Distribute large 3 × 5 Post-its and ask participants  to individually write down potential problems the  target user might have  one problem per Post-it .  The following questions can serve as prompts:  a.  What is the job-to-be-done?4 b.  What  is  the  problem  that  this  product  or   service will solve?  c.

Taking all the information in, you may realize that your  initial hypothesis might be the wrong one. If so, that’s great! You’ll congratulate your- self as this process has worked for you. As we mentioned earlier, there are plenty of  stories about products being built that no one needs nor wants.   Why reframe? Often we see organizations thinking and speaking in terms of their  features and their products, not the customer or the user’s eyes  the paying customer  and the user may not be the same person .  For example, have you ever purchased a pair of socks? Our guess is you probably have  purchased many socks over your lifetime, and they are always sold in pairs.   In 2003, Jonah Staw, a product designer at the prestigious Frog Design was joking  with  Arielle  Eckstut  about  how  they  could  solve  the  problem  of  missing  socks  by  wearing all the surviving socks that did not match. That silly joke inspired them to  start LittleMissMatched. They reframed the problem from “I have missing socks” to “I  can combine and wear these leftover socks” to ”None of my socks match, and that’s  awesome!” They sold socks in “pairs” of three that have matching color palettes but  no matching design patterns. Your suit-wearing Wall Street businesswoman might  not wear them, but 11-year-old girls absolutely loved it. Eleven years later, the com- pany is reportedly grossing over $30M annually in sales.5   The ability to reframe a situation can lead to incredible breakthroughs, and it can also  lead to small insights that you can leverage to delight your users. It all depends on   5  http:  www.startupwin.com littlemissmatched-mismatched-socks-a-smash-hit    100 DESIGN  SPRINT   your perspective and the ability to shift perspective once you have all the context in  front of your team. If you ask a team of engineers how to improve the experience of  the Amtrak ride between Boston and New York City, they may offer all sorts of sug- gestions for improvements in the rail structures, suspensions on the train, and more  comfortable seating. However, for the amount of funding it would take to implement  that type of system and infrastructure, you might also be able to hire exceptional  waitstaff as servers to serve top-shelf liquor and gourmet hors d’oeuvres to passen- gers during the trip. Rather than a shorter trip, passengers may start requesting a  longer duration.6   This reframed the problem from a structural, smooth ride to creating an experience.  The effort to improve that experience could be a much smaller implementation. These  are the little details you’ll want to seek out as you reframe the problem you’re solving.   A technique that can help with this is to create challenge maps. A challenge map asks  the questions “Why?” and “What’s stopping you?” and forces you to consider the  relationship between the possibilities. Once you’ve created a challenge map around  a particular issue, you can start to see what might be blocking the way to a solu- tion. Many times you start out in one area and learn that’s not the area you need to  focus on! With challenge maps, you can explore the problem you’ve identiﬁed and  determine whether you need to restate it, reframe it, or solve a different problem  altogether.  6   From Rory Sutherland’s TED talk  http:  www.wbur.org npr 308752278 brand-over-brain .

With the entire group, review the Post-its that were  created  and  see  if  any  of  the  added  statements  would make a more applicable Problem Statement.

Write  the  Problem  Statement  on  a  large  Post-it  note, and place it in the center of a whiteboard or a  ﬂipchart page. Add “How Might We”  or “HMW”  for short  before the text of the Post-it.  3.  Challenge this initial statement by asking the group   “Why should we do this?”   4.  Answer  that  “why”  question  on  another  Post- it note and place it above the initial Post-it note.  Add “How Might We” to the beginning of it.  Now  challenge that new statement with the same “why  should we do this?” question, adding Post-its go- ing upward. Repeat this until a natural endpoint is  reached  such as “to make more money” .  6.   5.  You  may  ﬁnd  there  are  multiple  reasons,  so  an- swering “why else?” will lead you to put Post-its to  the left or right of each other.  In the downward direction, challenge each “How  might we…” statement with the question “What’s  stopping us from doing this?” Answer that ques- tion, then rewrite it to a “How might we...” ques- tion, and place it below that Post-it.   7.  You may also ﬁnd multiple reasons for what’s stop- ping  you.  Place  Post-it  notes  to  the  left  or  right   answering “what else is stopping us?”  102 DESIGN  SPRINT   DESIGN  SPRINT  103   Know the User  In order to be successful, it is important to understand all the stakeholders surround- ing a project, product, or service.   Regardless of what anyone else says, people are the ones to buy and use your prod- uct, so keep them at the center of your work. Personas are a good way to explore  who those people are.  Personas are composite constructs of people, representations of the different types  of people who use your product. They may be imaginary but they are not ﬁctional,  as they are based on knowledge of your customer base and or user base. Personas  are less about demographic data, and more about context, attitude, and behavior.  If  you already have personas from past work, that’s excellent. You can bring the group  up to speed and double-check that your assumptions are correct. If you don’t have  personas yet, that’s OK; this is a great time to investigate the who you’re solving for.   That said, it’s important to deﬁne the difference between a user, a customer, and a  persona. It’s probably obvious, but to be clear, the user is a person who uses your  product or service. A user might not be the person paying for or administering the  product.  A  user  may  or  may  not  be  your  customer.  For  example,  a  customer  of    104 DESIGN  SPRINT   Google’s AdWords may be the one setting up the ad  and paying for it , while another  user may be a marketing director viewing the reports. Customers pay you money. Us- ers use your product. They may be one and the same, but that’s not always the case.  Further, when you have multisided markets, as is common in marketplace apps like  Airbnb or Lyft, you have multiple user types  i.e., multiple whos! .   The Who Do exercise  from our friends who wrote Gamestorming  is a great way to  begin to explore the stakeholder ecosystem. It answers two simple questions: who are  the different stakeholders and what do you want to them to do with your product?   Once you know who the stakeholders are, you can ﬂesh out more of the informa- tion about them. You won’t have to consider all the stakeholders from the Who Do   exercise—one  or two  will sufﬁce.   DESIGN  SPRINT  105   Who Do  How 1.  Draw a two-column table with “Who” on the left   and “Do” on the right.  2.  Ask  the  group:  Who  are  the  stakeholders?  Who  might be an obstacle? Whose support is critical to  this project’s success? Generate an exhaustive list  of whos, writing each on the whiteboard or on a  Post-it.   3.  The  Do  column  is  typically  more  challenging.  For  each who, ask: What do they need to do, or do dif- ferently? What do they need to do for this project  to be successful?  If  necessary,  you  can  add  columns—for  example,  “Gives” and “Gets.”  4.   5.  You can then rank and prioritize. If the choice isn’t  obvious, you can have each participant indicate the  most important whos dos by sticking dots on them.

Research  you  may  already  have  on  hand  will  tell you the what and when of a user’s actions, but the  why  remains  elusive  and  the  best  way  is  to  converse  directly with an actual user to discover this information,  and any other relevant information that may help drive  the design of a product or service.  As  an  example,  when  Dana  Mitroff-Silvers  began  a  design  sprint  for  the  Denver  Museum  of  Nature  and   Science,  she  started  by  running  all  the  participants  through an introductory “wallet project” design-think- ing exercise from Stanford’s d.school:7   “It’s  essentially  the  wallet  exercise  from  the  Stanford  d. school, but I change it out every time with a different de- sign challenge based on where I’m going and who the  group is.  We’ve designed a morning commute. We de- signed  the  ideal  neighborhood.  We  designed  a  Sunday  night experience. It all depends on who I’m working with.”     7  The Wallet Exercise is 90-minute project through a full design  cycle. Participants gain an experiential introduction to the phases of  the design approach and some shared vocabulary.  https:  dschool. stanford.edu groups designresources wiki 4dbb2 The_Wallet_Proj- ect.html .  By completing this exercise up front, she was able to  navigate the remainder of the sprint and refer back to  it to reinforce its concepts as necessary during the rest  of  the  sprint,  ultimately  bringing  a  sense  of  empathy  to the team. After the introductory exercise, she sent ev- eryone out into the museum to observe and interact with  museum goers:  “We  get  ready  to  go  out  and  do  the  real  interviews;  we talk about what the design challenge is, and then  we  talk  about  questions  you  might  ask.  Sometimes  I  let people draft their own questions; sometimes I give  them starter questions. It depends on how much time  and the group’s comfort level and then I send them off  to do interviews. Sometimes we do some observation  of museum visitors out in the gallery: “What are they  doing? What are they using? What kind of ﬁgures are  you seeing?”  Larissa Chavarria at The Advisory Board does something  similar:  although  she  doesn’t  have  the  luxury  that  the  museum has with a location full of users to access, she  has her teams get on the phone with users. Because of  the nature of their product, sometimes users are internal  employees and there’s easier access, but for many teams,  scheduling interviews on short notice is a challenge.   110 DESIGN  SPRINT   “After each interview, the team gets together and does a  team debrief. After every interview, we have sticky notes,  and it’s two minutes to write down, ‘what do you think  the user really wanted or what was surprising?’ Having  the sticky notes helps people who are maybe more in- troverted or some people who are stronger at the table  can sort of overpower a meeting. The sticky note process  is great because everyone silently brainstorms. You put  them up on the wall and you say, ‘OK, this is a recurring  theme. You group those together. This is an outlier, we  didn’t think about it.’ Then you vote, ‘do you think this  is important? Or is this a totally random thought?’ It’s a  good process to make everyone equal.”  Once  they  have  completed  the  interviews,  her  team  creates  a  matrix  to  determine  which  observations  are  important to drive the next phase.

This will add context to your project and high- light opportunities you may have otherwise missed. We  often see teams focusing only on areas where the cus- tomer is engaged in using the product, and they miss  out on many opportunities to create delightful experi- ences based on that behavior or entry point.   Using an experience map or a user journey map is an  excellent  way  to  visualize  the  journey.  In  a  user  jour- ney map, you break down the journey of each persona  into different stages.  Once you have all of those stages   and goals for each stage , you can see the touchpoints  where  the  user  would  interact  with  your  product  or  service. “Touchpoints” are the interactions of personas  with the product or service. Keep in mind that the dif- ferent personas you created earlier may have different  needs,  attitudes,  and  behaviors—however,  their  jour- neys may remain the same. They might not, hence the  need for this journey map.    Let’s consider a search engine optimization  SEO  exam- ple. Before a user is thinking about SEO, she is writing  content for her blog, creating marketing collateral, or  perhaps responding to a review on Yelp. Maybe she’s  taking a call from a customer or writing an email in re- sponse to a support ticket. All these activities can yield  insight into how you might engage users who are un- dertaking SEO activities. Understanding the user’s situa- tion is key to deﬁning the context and the opportunities  your team has to create a solution that not only meets,  but also delights.   A  journey  map  documents  the  stakeholder  experi- ence from beginning to end, inside and outside of the  product to identify opportunities for ideation. Further,  the team will keep the waystations on the user’s jour- ney map in mind as they sketch their ideas during the   Diverge phase of the design sprint.  112 DESIGN  SPRINT   How 1.  Divide group into smaller teams according to the  number  of  key  stakeholders  or  personas  you  are  completing journey maps for.  2.  Each team deﬁnes the stages of the current stake- holder experience from beginning to end on large  Post-its in a horizontal line at the top of the wall or  display board.  3.  For  each  stage,  deﬁne  the  goal s   the  stakehold- er has for that stage; write these on small Post-its,  one goal per Post-it, and place directly beneath the  corresponding stage.  4.  Continue this process for tasks and tools. 5.  Next,  map  the  stakeholder  mental  state  by  ei- ther drawing a moving line s  across all the stages    high = happy, low = unhappy  or by noting signiﬁ- cant points of mental state with happy or sad faces,  or the corresponding emotion label  e.g., relieved .   6.  Based on low points on the mental state, list needs,  then  opportunities,  on  small  Post-its,  one  need  opportunity per Post-it, and post below the corre- sponding stage.   If necessary, perform a vote  using dot stickers  to  determine primary opportunities to move forward  with.  7.

It’s  best  that  journey  maps  focus  on  existing  workﬂows, but they can be modiﬁed to map out pro- posed goals and needs to deﬁne what should be built.  Don’t just focus on the product workﬂow; you’ll want  to include product elements that are part of the user’s  current path that does not involve interaction with the  product. Don’t leave out the user’s mental state, as this  is a signiﬁcant eye-opener.

We’ve taken the data we have  and considered those constraints. We’ve spent all the  energy and effort up to this point understanding and  identifying the problem. This is a good time to take a  step back to reﬂect on your work and appreciate what  was accomplished,  and allow everyone to propose im- provements and share concerns, and plan action items.  The end of the day is an ideal time to do a retrospec- tive, even if that falls in the middle of one of the design  sprint  phases.  It’s  a  great  way  for  the  team  to  come  together  before  everyone  leaves  for  the  night,  giving  closure to the day by reﬂecting on it and planning for  tomorrow.  There are many common retrospective formats. We rec- ommend a Plus Delta approach.  How 1.  Draw two columns on a whiteboard: one for a “+”   plus: what went well  and one for “∆”  delta: the  Greek symbol for change .  2.  Ask the group to reﬂect on what was positive and   capture those thoughts under the “+” column.  3.  Ask  the  group  then  to  candidly  brainstorm  what  they  would  change  about  the  day,  and  put  these   under the “∆” column.  4.  For  each  item  in  the  “∆”  column,  list  any  action  items  that  can  be  taken.  For  example,  “revisit  the  challenge  statement  to  include  Larissa’s  feedback  about older users.” Address these action items in the  next day’s activities, or note them for future sprints.  Difﬁculty: Easy Size: Everyone Materials: Whiteboard or Post-its  Context: Done at the end of every phase, except the  Prototype  phase,  which  requires  a  longer,  more  in- depth retrospective of the entire design sprint.  Don’t ignore or skip over this exercise; daily reﬂection  will help you continually monitor your progress. Don’t  think that every delta is an immediate action item, or  allow deltas to become just “what I didn’t like.”  Approximate time: 10–15 minutes at the end of each  day, 30 minutes at the end of the design sprint  Credit: Plus Deltas are found in the book Gamestorm- ing.

As the ﬁrst day concludes, take the opportunity to go out with the team if you can.  Getting out of the conference room will give you a fresh perspective, and the con- versations  you  have  will  forge  connections  with  your  colleagues  that  will  last  the  duration of your project and beyond. You will likely be tired toward the end of the  remaining days of your sprint, so take advantage of this.   Drinks are a low-pressure way to get together without a big time commitment. The  people who are local will then be able to get home to their families at a reasonable  hour. Make sure you leave early enough; we prefer to leave for drinks no later than  4:30 p.m.  or 5 p.m. at the latest . If people want to spend more time after, anyone  who chooses to can go out to dinner.  If there isn’t a good place to go nearby, raid the beer and soda fridge and have a chat  in your company’s lounge or café. It’s almost as good, and you can’t beat the price!  Pace yourself; the second day of a design sprint is coming up soon and will be an  intense one. Equally attractive nonalcoholic beverages  EANABs  are also always an  option!

Facilitating Workshops.   5.0 Why facilitate?    Co-creation makes great sense. In engaging a diverse group of participants in a  multidisciplinary team, we guarantee a rounded approach to a product, keep it rooted in  reality and ensure later buy-in from a wide group of stakeholders who have been  involved from the beginning. We need that precious range of viewpoints and  experience.    But put some guys from marketing, some hotline staff, a financial whizz, some techies,  some middle management, a couple of designers, a union rep and a handful of  customers in a room, and sit back to listen. It will immediately be clear that the people  speak very varied languages, sometimes literally. They might not share the same level  of education or powers of empathy, abstraction, expression and comprehension. They  certainly have different ways of working, diverse goals and varied measures of success.  How can we get the most out of these people, and keep them moving forwards together  in a context where they all feel useful, engaged and might even come again next time?  Figuring that out is the role of the facilitator.    Many people in service design come from a graphic design or product design  background. Their key skill and primary tool might be sketching or visualisation – given  a problem, they first reach for a pen. Others come from UX, and might be strong in  throwing together quick physical or digital mock-ups and testing them effectively. Yet  others are managers, and are at home persuading with Powerpoint or Excel, assigning  goals or directing and motivating groups by talking or email.     But if service design is a truly co-creative activity, then facilitation must be the  key tool of any practitioner.    A quick search online or a glance through your business library will reveal a lifetime’s  reading on the role and roles of the facilitator. Some experts distinguish between the  facilitator, and someone who is just facilitating. Others talk about a facilitator, a  facilitative individual, a facilitative leader and a facilitative group1. But most of this good  advice arises from the context of meetings, debates and similar work sessions – largely  verbal activities which are usually set up to make decisions. Service design, in contrast,  is a creative, exploratory and sometimes physical activity which has a very different  process and outcome. Are the traditional business facilitation approaches enough? In                                                    1 Michael Doyle 1996, in Facilitator’s Guide to Participatory Decision Making, Sam Kaner, Jossey-Bass  Third Edition 2014, p xx    this book, we suggest adding techniques used in other creative and exploratory  processes. In service design, in related disciplies, and in this book, you will also find  terms like director, servant-leader, Joker and Difficultator.     In reality, the task is hard to pigeonhole and the role is a fluid one. Whatever he calls  himself, a facilitator uses specialist skills and knowledge to “make easy” the journey  through an often unfamiliar process, and tries to leverage the experience and expertise  of the group while maintaining sustainable cooperation and perhaps even developing  the individual members.       5.1 Key concepts of facilitation    A facilitator works at three levels simultaneously – process, group and individual. She  will facilitate the process, offering information, selecting activities and consolidating  results to guide the work towards a successful conclusion. She will facilitate the group,  keeping them motivated, engaged and productive while handling conflicts and tensions.  And she will facilitate the individual, helping them to be more empathic, analytic,  creative or sceptical as needed, and perhaps helping them evolve in their skills and  perspectives.     5.1.1 Consent  While it’s possible to facilitate a process without the consent of the participants, it is an  uphill struggle. Most facilitators prefer to get the explicit consent before going far into the  project – but that simple nod on the first morning is never enough. At first, all the  particpiants know about an external facilitator is that she is an outsider, probably earns  more per hour than most other people in the room, and was just seen joking with the  boss in the corridor. There is no trust at all, but nobody will speak up against her at the  beginning of the project in the glare of C-suite attention. Lack of consent is more often  not explicit, but is a creeping sickness of lethargic responses, sideways glances and  insupportable objections.    To counter this, many facilitators slowly stack up implicit consent through a series of  agreements designed to build trust. They might start with consensus on the simple stuff  like timings, breaks and where to have lunch, then move on to agreements on the  process and how to make group decisions. Later, depending on their style, there might  be permission to step into disputes, to offer suggestions, even to determine the  endpoint of the process.      5.1.2 Status  The status of a facilitator is complex. It is binary: she might be master of the process,  but she is also a servant of the group and their bosses. And it is variable: localised  within a room or project, temporary, and limited even there. But as an outsider a  facilitator can also say and do things which others cannot. As discussed in the section  on styles of facilitation, Forum Theater2 practitioners call their facilitator a Joker, and the  term fits well for any facilitator. Like a medieval fool, a facilitator is disqualified from  holding real power, so she is free to state the obvious, ask the stupid question and  name the elephant in the room. And like a joker in cards, she can rapidly change her  status to suit the needs of the moment, switching from expert to innocent, from slave to  queen.    Most people in organisations “have” status – through seniority, personality and network,  or some combination of those. For facilitators, it is more useful to see status not as an  innate quality, but as a tool which can be consciously applied and changed at need  see  section XXX in this chapter .       5.1.3 Neutrality  There is a great expectation of facilitators to be fair, and one of the fastest ways to lose  a group’s consent is to behave in a way which they see as biased. But different  facilitators have different interpretations of neutrality, especially when it comes to  content.    We can think of a project as having several aspects. There is the structure, the process  and the content3. The structure is stable and includes membership and roles in the  group. The process is how a group works together – the sequence of activities they  undertake, how they communicate, make decisions and more. And the content refers to  what the group is working on, for example the problem they are trying to solve, or the  thing they are trying to create.    Many facilitators, especially external ones, have little input into the structure of a project.  They are given a team to work with, and a set amount of time to reach a successful  outcome. They might be able to suggest other group members, beg for more time, and  assign roles within the group – but little more.                                                       2 a facilitated, participatory theater form in which members of the audience explore possible strategies by  stepping into a play themselves; see later in this chapter.  3 See Roger Schwarz in The Skilled Facilitator Fieldbook, by Schwarz, Davidson, Carlson & McKinney er  al, Jossey-Bass 2005, p 3    In questions of process, the facilitator usually has far more power. Often they are invited  precisely because they master a certain set of tools or activities which the group does  not understand. At times, they will adopt certain operative habits of the host  organisation – like a certain way to do feedback, or critical KPIs4 – but they are  generally at least an equal partner in the process design.    When it comes to content the division of responsibility between facilitator and host  organisation is less clear. Some facilitators, especially external ones, choose to stay  well away from all content matters. They take care of the process, and remain firmly  agnostic to the ideas involved and the final result. Others are happy to share their own  knowledge in a carefully neutral way – “I saw it done this way at corporation X”,  “Professor Y wrote an interesting article on that” – but will not make a judgement or cast  a vote. A third group feels able to grapple fully with the content, stating firm opinions  and making suggestions while also owning the process. Whichever path they choose,  facilitators will need to pay at least enough attention to the content to make sure that the  group is on target and making progress towards the goals of the workshop.     5.2 Styles and roles of facilitation     5.2.1. Adopting a role    Effective facilitation is hugely a matter of style choices.  Different facilitators will have  very different focus and “tone”, even if they use the same methods and the same  timetable. They will have diverse approaches to consent, status and neutrality, as well  as their own prefered activities and personality quirks. But it is not always necessary or  even advisable to “be yourself” as a facilitator. Like a manager, a facilitator steps into a  role, and can choose how that role should be. This does not mean pretending to be  someone you are not  or copying another facilitator  as inauthenticity is bound to fail. It  is about deciding which aspects of your personality to emphasise, which choices to  make today.    Many related disciplines offer pre-made roles which can be adopted or adapted for  service design facilitation. A director in theater or film co-creates a new experience by  instructing and coaching her ensemble towards an outcome. The role is much like a  manager in many ways, and various styles can be seen5. Some directors have a clear                                                     4 Key Performance Indicators  5 Importantly, the director is not usually an actress herself, so she is leading a team of people who are  capable of things she cannot do This is very similar to the situation of software development managers,  who are not usually coders.    vision of the final result, others let it emerge; some are very open to input from the  ensemble, others are more autocratic. But like many  product-  design stars, and like  many managers, a director takes primary responsibility for the final result - something  that few service design facilitators would do. This can be a difficult model for design  teams, as the participants can feel instrumentalised, but some aspects of it - in  particular the coaching team members to play to their strengths - are very useful.     In Scrum, an approach to co-creation most usually seen in Agile software development,  the facilitation of the project is cleverly divided into two roles: the Product Owner and the  Scrum Master6. The Product owner is responsible for the successful output of the  project - making sure that the needs of the sponsoring organisation and the customer  are met. He does not inteact with the development team in technical matters. The  Scrum Master is responsible for the success of  the development process. She will  “protect” the development team, making sure that they stay on target, but also that they  have freedom to work. Scrum Masters are sometimes described as “servant leaders”7,  in that they serve the team by leading them to success. If adopting this model, service  design facilitators can consciously switch between these roles, perhaps in different  phases of the workshop, or can share them between co-facilitators.    Improvised theater also has some facilitation approaches and roles which can gove you  ideas. Just like design, improvisation takes a fundamentally unpredictable process and  gives it form and direction by sticking religiously to some simple structures and  principles. Among these is the idea of co-leadership, exemplified in the tradition of “Yes,  and…”, or even more strongly in Viola Spolin’s call to “follow the follower”8. The practice  of Applied Improvisation takes these attitudes from the stage and into organisations,  and is full of useful lessons for co-creative facilitators. One special variety of improvised  exploration, Forum Theater9, has a very interesting facilitator role called the Joker. In  this role, practitioners accept that co-creative groups will often try to make their lives  easier by making their task simpler than it is. Teams are naturally tempted to assume  that their idea will be accepted quickly, that people will want to use it and will  understand it, that the sun will shine and all will go to plan. A Joker is tasked with  challenging these assumptions, representing the harshness of the real world and  making things more tricky for the design team. The name “Joker” is very well chosen.  Just like the joker in a pack of cards, he is fundamentally neutral. He is also changeable                                                     6 Schwaber and Sutherland, www.scrumguides.org  7 Robert K Greenleaf, “The Servant as a Leader” 1970 and later writings.

ISBN 978-0-7453-1657-4.      or apparently capricious, often using dark humour to flip between making life easier for  the team  being a “facilitator”  and making it more difficult  being a “difficultator” .     5.2.2. Co-facilitation    Facilitators often work alone, but it can be very effective to have a facilitation team. With  large groups, there might be a lead facilitator or facilitators with responsibility for the  entire process. Junior co-facilitators might then step in for particular tasks, or each could  gve more hands-on assistance to a subset of the group. It’s also fruitful to share the  lead completely, taking turns to be in the spotlight. This gives the participants variation  in delivery and style, which will help them pay attention. The facilitator who is less in  focus can watch the group for potential musinderstandings, prepare the next task, work  on documentation of the process or simply be ready to step in as needed. It’s  enormously empowering to be facilitating in the knowledge that you can go as far as  you need to go, try new ideas - your colleague will get you out of trouble.    If you have the opportunity to work as a facilitation team, plan your roles consciously.  With two facilitators, one effective division is for one facilitator to be outcome focussed,  while the other takes care of the needs of the group in the room. This is similar to the  division of Scrum roles mentioned in the previous section, and it is not far from the TV  thriller classic of “good cop, bad cop” - at least as far as the participants are  concerned10. Sometimes, the backgrounds or organisational roles of the facilitators will  offer other useful divisions, such as “front stage, back stage”  user experience vs  process , or “digital, physical”. It can also be useful for one “low flying” person to take  charge of the tools and exercises being run in the room, and another to connect the  outputs of those into the “high flying” strategy and goals, showing the participants that  they are on target for their organisational needs.    Having multiple facilitators also gives the facilitation team one very valuable tool - it’s  possible for the facilitators to publicly  but politely  disagree. Doing this consciously can  help more passive groups understand that there is no one clear “answer” to the task  they face, and that their own input is just as valuable as the facilitators’.    TEXTBOX from Carola Verschoor, TiSDD Alumn  “When we did our first jam, Nicole and I said: okay, which will you be? Adam? Markus?  Marc? It helped to be inspired by others as we went into our roles. Facilitation involves  stepping into a role in order to help others achieve their goals. The freedom you have in  the tools is also a freedom you have in terms of how you use that role.”                                                    10 Colleagues with military experience have likened these roles to the duties of the second in command  and the senior NCO; or even to clichéd “mother and father” roles.         5.2.3 Team members as facilitators?    It’s a common question -  “can a team member be a facilitator?”. In most situations, this  seems difficult. A colleague working temporarily as a facilitator might have the consent  of the group, but it is difficult to remain neutral if you are in the project because of your  connection to the theme. It is even more tricky to be perceived as unbiased when you  represent a certain part of an organisation. More crucially, an internal facilitator does not  have access to the full range of status strategies which an external facilitator can adopt.  She has a clear place in the hierarchy, and cannot move too far from that status in  either direction.    In everyday project work, budget constraints or timing often mean that one of a team  must take on the facilitator role. While challenging, this is certainly not impossible. Take  a look at the tricks of traditional meeting processes, where the chairperson is a  temporary role given localised authority. Their unique status is suggested by some ritual  agenda tasks and a special physical position in the room.    Generally they concentrate on guiding the process but will get involved in decisions via  a casting vote when it’s unavoidable. That’s an excellent simple model for facilitating  colleagues – taking control of the agenda and timing, keeping some distance from the  issues by perhaps standing at the flipchart while others sit, and only dipping into the  content level when necessary or especially valuable.    A team leader in a facilitator role will have great difficulty ever being seen as neutral and  will find it hard to effectively adopt a lower status. This makes it especially difficult to  combine project leadership and facilitation tasks, as Scrum acknowledges with the split  into the roles of Product Owner and Scrum Master.        5.3 Building the team    The cast of people in the room may vary at different stages of the project, and may not  be the choice of the facilitator. But a good rule of thumb is to involve representatives of  “anyone affected by the project, anyone who will deliver it, and anyone who can stop it”.  Many organisations tend to restrict the invitation list to the core responsible team, but  they are usually quick to see the benefits of involving other parts of the organisation,  and these “guests” are often enthusiastic about being involved. On a longer project, this    can cause budgeting issues – who is paying for that person’s time? – so make sure to  discuss this aspect in good time.    When it comes to customers, many organisations are unwilling to show their offerings in  an incomplete state and to let customers look “behind the scenes” in co-design  sessions. It’s a pity, because this inclusive approach can be a real PR win. When airline  KLM set up a co-design lab at Schipol airport, they expected  and got  great insights.  But they were surprised by their customers’ huge positive reaction to actually being  involved in a design process11, instead of just a satisfaction survey. Usually, though,  organisations are only willing to involve end users in limited phases of the design  process, in a way familiar from the the old-fashioned “focus groups”. One way to extend  this is to involve customers in other ways, for example in more street testing and  contextual interviews, so that the team see first hand the value of including customers  and are keen to bring them into the workroom.     5.4 Planning the work    Group facilitation takes place over various timeframes, which we can think of as the  project scale  months, weeks  and the session scale  hours, days . Project-level  planning will usually follow whatever innovation or design structure the organisation and  facilitator choose, such as the typical iterative process of research, insights, ideation,  prototyping, testing and implementation  see chapter XXX .    It’s vital to remember that design is an exploratory activity, and it is both futile and  counterproductive to try to plan everything – whether on a project or session scale. The  facilitator and the group will have to adjust and pivot as they go along, changing plans to  fit the reality of the discovery process but never losing sight of the time constraints.  Smart facilitators will incorporate these adjustments in the project planning, or might  even adopt an approach like the Agile approach to software development, which has a  planned cycle of work sprints, reflection and reorientation.    Planning the facilitation will be a matter of choosing activities and allocating resources  along this process. Within a single session there might be less ground to cover – and  thus more freedom for the facilitator. On whatever scale, the facilitator will be planning  from two points of view. She will have design goals, and will need to plan methods  which achieve them. But she will also have to consider the human needs of participants,  planning a sequence of activities and goals which is not only effective but also  engaging, enabling, encouraging and enjoyable. She should take time to create a “safe                                                     11 Marcel Zwiers, 31 Volts, presentation at Service Design in Tourism Conferece, Sarasota 2013    space” for their team, helping them to be more creative, flexible and willing to both fail  and share.     5.5 Safe Space    Many service design tools and methods seem uncomfortable and strange to people in  organisations, especially because a creative process needs people to fail. This is a very  unfamiliar way of working, and people need help to accept and come to welcome it.    One way to help people be happy to fail is to create a “Safe Space”, the physical and  mental environment which accepts and embraces failure. This is very important, and  skimping on this aspect is one main reason why innovation workshops can fail or be  unpopular. The idea of Safe Space is well developed in theater, where every actor  knows that the rehearsal room is completely safe. He can try anything there without fear  of censure, will never be interrupted or mocked, and will be judged only on what he  chooses to bring out of the room.  A Safe Space cannot be set up by simply declaring it. “Today, nothing we do goes  beyond this room” is a statement which only works if there is full trust, and trust is not  usually present at the beginning of a co-creative project. Instead, Safe Space is built up  using a mix of techniques – both in the planning phase and during the session itself.  Many of these techniques are based on giving a sense of security to participants who  are going through an unfamiliar process. Others help the team members adopt different  mindsets – catalogues of behaviour and responses – which are unlike the usual work  mindset and are more conducive to cooperative, creative work.    Own the space: a good co-creative session needs its own private space where the  group are not overlooked. Close the door, un-invite guests  “no spectators today – join  in or step out” , and paper up any windows which expose you to curious passers-by.  This need not be overt – a strip of flipchart paper at eye-height gives privacy and holds  your sticky notes later. You can extend the room ownership to the group by letting them  rearrange the room themselves  see “break with routine” below .    Start in familiar territory: it’s rarely helpful to plunge people into cold water. Start  where they feel safe, for example in a corporate environment you might wear a suit and  welcome guests into a conservative room layout. Perhaps you start with a calm  Powerpoint presentation showing which critical goals or strategic campaigns the project  is part of. Orientation is important  see below , but people don’t always perform best if  they know exactly what is coming. Show an agenda which describes the coming  session in conservative terms, without being dishonest. For example, an agenda point  of “roleplay session” or “live street research” will worry some group members, but you    can describe the same session as “understanding the customer” and no-one will think  twice.    >>> textbox case story from Arne Starting with powerpoint suit-up, then getting rid of business  dress step-by-step.     Invoke authority: It’s possible to establish authority and ownership of the process with  a firm welcoming handshake, a look straight in the eye, a tone of voice and carefully  chosen words of welcome. Sometimes, you need more. If you have reference  customers who are impressive and perhaps also conservative, you might name them  when you introduce yourself to the group, and say in what context you were able to help  them.  If you have relevant qualifications which will mean something to the group  and if  can talk about them without sounding like a boaster  mention them early on.  You might also mention some very conservative and traditional organisations who are  using service design or design thinking, like the Big Four consulting companies and  their peers12, or the US Military13. For the biggest effect, get senior staff of your client  organisation to address the group by email, video message or in person and tell them  which parts of the organisation are behind the initiative, and which strategic goals it fits  into.    Break with routine: having started off in a conservative tone, it’s time to show that the  upcoming work session will be different and will have room for other kinds of idea and  behaviour. Do something unusual but clearly useful  like an extreme warm-up, complete  with neurological explanation of why it’s important; or have the group quickly rearrange  the room for group work . It’s impossible to win trust straight away, but you might  generate some curiosity. If someone resists warm-ups as kid’s stuff, talk about the  science and experience behind them14 and imply that someone who rejects them is  missing an opportunity to be more effective.    Ease in: don’t jump straight into the hard stuff, or put anyone in the spotlight yet. The  break with routine will have started to open the safe space in the minds of the group, so  now might be a good time to agree or establish some ground rules. The Rules of  Rehearsal are one example, but you might have your own. It’s useful to establish early  on how you will make decisions – the Rules of Rehearsal do this via the point “doing,  not talking”. You might play a game to demonstrate useful behaviours or attitudes, like                                                    12 “Service Design will be at the core of where we want to go.” Joydeep Bhattacharya, Managing Director, Accenture Interactive  Financial Services at SDN global conference, Stockholm 2014.    13 Art of Design, Student Text Vol. 2 by US Military “School of Advanced Military Studies” at  http:  usacac.army.mil cac2 CGSC events sams ArtofDesign_v2.pdf    14References to come    perhaps a “Yes, and…” game. Or you might quickly sketch the format of the day. Don’t  spend too long on this. After an intense warm-up, the team will want action, not  discussion.    >>> Textbox or graphic photo: Rules of Rehearsal. 3: Use what you have. 2: Play  seriously. 1: Doing, not talking”    Give orientation: people will feel more comfortable if they know where they are in the  process, so a large visual of the whole process is always reassuring. Some phases of a  design task are not comfortable, even for experienced designers, and telling the group  that it is o.k. to feel confused or out of control at these points will help them enormously.   Refer to your process visualisation often and especially to the divergent and convergent  phases.  The Squiggle is also useful here, see page XXX .  The end of a divergent phase can feel overwhelming. Participants thought they had a  handle on the project, now suddenly there are so many new ideas, so many possible  variations. This is a loss of control, which is precisely what most organisational  processes try to avoid. It’s unfamiliar – so tell them “it’s normal to feel like this”, and try  to never end a session on a divergent phase.  Being moved into convergence before you feel ready  the “crunch”  can also be  unsettling. Someone who is not used to an iterative process will be used to making  more-or-less binding decisions and will want to check all the data carefully before they  feel ready to decide. Reassure them that they are not committed until the end of the  project, and that prototyping and testing will check the ideas for them.    Sh!tty First Drafts: people who are new to creative work are usually far too careful.  They think creativity is about having great ideas, so they spend too much time on their  first ideas and run the risk of falling in love with them. Show them that in these early  iterations, low-fi is encouraged.  You could show them some of your own ratty sketches, some very flimsy prototypes, or  perhaps introduce the concept of Sh!tty First Drafts. This is based on Hemingway’s  observation15 that, “the first draft of anything is shit”. That’s a tough word to say in some  corporate concepts, but there is no better way to express the idea. Gifted director  Robert Rodríguez16 wrote that “ever director has at least 10 bad films in them”, and  urged his students to get those bad films out of the way so they could start making good  ones.                                                      15  Hemingway’s statement, and the term “Shitty First Draft” was popularised by Ann Lamott in her 1994 book, Bird by Bird: Some  Instructions on Writing and Life.    16 Robert Rodríguez, Rebel Without a Crew: Or, How a 23-year-old Film Maker with $7,000 Became a Hollywood Player,       In the Executive Schools which led to this book, the concept of the “Sh!tty First Draft”  became a real favourite with participants returning to their companies, as it freed people  from the desire to think everything through in detail and take responsibility for every  spontaneous idea.    >>> TEXTBOX - Adam on Sh!tty First Drafts  You can talk about Sh!tty First Drafts explicitly, or leave the term unsaid and instead  encourage people towards them. One way is to use seemingly “impossible deadlines”  which make the group worry about quantity instead of quality. For example, in a 10 + 10  sketching exercise  chapter XXX  where a group is supposed to produce ten sketches  in a round, just give them three or four minutes for the whole task.  The resulting sketches will be so quick and scribbled that it is clear that none of them –  or the ideas behind them – will be very good. But one or more will be a starting point,  and the rest will be easy to leave behind.  >>> Photos of some SFDs, perhaps with quotes from TiSDD participants.      Image: Sh!tty First Drafts can be made in seconds or minutes           Image: A Sh!tty First Draft of a webpage gets across the basic idea in seconds, and  starts the iteration process in minutes.       Image  A Sh!tty First Draft or “guesstimation” of the numbers can let teams rescope  early              image: A Sh!tty First Draft of a train seating system immediately reveals practical  problems                Mix activities, make a mess: different people appreciate and understand different  types of activities, so keep the energy in the room and appeal to different audiences by  including a broad mix of activities. Try to choose activities which make a clear  contribution to the task at hand, but vary the location in the room, the media, the focus,  and the physical position of participants.  You can emphasise the explorative, “throw-away” nature of ideas by creating a mess as  you go on. Consciously use different coloured pens and scraps of paper. Have candy in  wrappers  rustling, noisy ones are best  which litter the room. Have things like toys,  gadgets and old prototypes lying about – people will pick them up and fiddle with them  while they think and talk. All these will help people remain sketchy in their thinking and  presentation, until the time comes to focus down, make choices and tidy the room.    Avoid killer words: avoid words and phrases which force people to be overly analytical  or which raise the stakes on ideas too early. Don’t ask for “your best ideas”, just ask for  a heap of ideas “to get us started”. Don’t ask people to “choose the best option”, just tell  them to “grab an interesting one to kick off with”. Don’t ask for a presentation or a role- play, ask instead for a quick status report or say “show me how it might look”.    Offer safety nets: help people learn to let go of ideas by always generating so many of  them that letting go of some is easier.  There is also a close link between the number of  ideas in the early part of a project and the final success.  Increase the willingness to let  go by throwing nothing away. Ask teams to pin up “abandoned” ideas on the wall so  they can come back to them later if necessary. Help them look back at painful but useful  experiences by not asking “how should we have done this better”, but by asking “how  might we do this in future?” Let groups choose which ideas and insights to take forward,  so someone can quietly ask his group, “can we not take my suggestion, please”.     Avoid judgement: in most corporate contexts, quickly deciding what is good and what  is not is a key skill. Service design encourages us not to rank and choose ideas, but to  evolve them through prototyping and testing. So it is helpful to avoid asking “was that a  good idea?”, but instead asking “how did that feel?” or “what does that suggest?”. In a  co-creative environment, the words “good” and “bad” are rarely useful for content.    Fail first: it is no use telling participants that failure is welcome, then doing everything  you can yourself to avoid it. If you mess up a part of your facilitation, be open about it.  Laugh, and describe it as a learning opportunity  some irony is completely appropriate .  Be clear that the whole session is explorative, and that some activities might fail. Give  permission to be human by being human yourself.      >>> EXAMPLE GRAPHIC  Storyboard  of a day to show these principles in practice       On a typical one day workshop using a challenging and unfamiliar tool like Investigative  Rehearsal, we might spend 2 hours establishing safe space before subtly slipping into  the rehearsal phase.

Move straight into real investigative rehearsal  Chapter XXX  without a pause  ease  in         5.6 Work Modes in Teams  Whether “brainstorming”, discussion or prototyping, group work in teams has three  basic forms. Each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses, but only one of them  is commonly used. Look out for them in groups – consciously switching between them  can be a useful tool. We describe them as if the task was a written one like drawing up  new ideas, but the models apply equally well to working on a prototype. In chapter XXX  we give examples of using each mode consciously in various project structures and in  each method.        5.6.1 One page, one pen.  All the group members are talking and one person is writing – either taking notes on a  pad or device, or sketching on a flipchart or board for all to see. Although status within  the group plays a role, the “hands on” person has a basic choice between being a  servant or a king. If he chooses the servant option, he will write down or draw group  consensus and the task will probably keep him from taking much part in the  conversation. Instead, he tries to make a fair representation of the other guys’ work.   If he were more ambitious, he could choose to be more hesitant to write on the board,  waiting until he agrees before writing a point down, or shaping his notes to his preferred    slant on the discussion. With various degrees of subtlety and success, he could take the  crown of the king.     “One page, one pen” is the default mode for most groups. It is familiar, and has the  strong advantage that what comes out has coherence, basic consensus, and is  understood by the whole group, especially when the work has been visible to all. But  this consensus has a price – more diverse ideas and opinions have already been ironed  out. We have a narrow, “pre-digested” outcome – and it is very slow in comparison with  the other modes.     5.6.2 One page, many pens.  In this mode, the whole group sits or stands around a shared work surface. Everyone is  writing, drawing, amending the same drawing or text. There might be discussion, or they  might work in silence. They share their time between writing and drawing, and looking at  what the others are doing, what they are changing.    This mode is reasonably consensual. Afterwards there may be a need to tidy up and  explain some of the work to each other, but there is usually a basic understanding of the  shared ideas. The technique is messy, but quite fast. Conflicts and differences of  opinion are usually quite visible on the page as crossings-out or notes and might be the  start for a good discussion afterwards.    This mode also works digitally: when writing publications, we often use Google Docs to  write simultaneously in the same document. We don’t have any verbal channel open –  we simply write, or sit back and watch the other cursors before dropping in to rearrange,  rewrite or add emphasis and examples. Specific web-based software tools like  BlankCanvas or Spacedeck can make this even easier. It’s a surprisingly smooth  process and very effective. In workshop settings with smaller groups or dispersed team  members this might be a powerful tool.     5.6.3 Many pages, many pens.  The group consciously split up and work as individuals. Each one writes on their own  pages, usually writing or sketching one idea per page. Often, the group sets itself a goal  of an ambitious number of ideas in a fixed time period. This encourages them to keep  looking after the obvious ideas have been recorded, sketching even wild ideas as they  try to fulfil their goal. When the time is up, they come back together and show the group  their results.    The group can use this mode to develop many ideas in a very short time. Some ideas  will probably occur several times from different group members, but there will still be far    more diversity than with either other mode. On the whole, this method is fast – but it  does not bring a shared understanding. Some of the ideas will need to be explained to  the rest of the group, and this will take some more time after the sketching is completed.  The group will also need to decide which ideas to take forward, either by discussion or  using selection matrices or portfolios  see for example the “Idea Portfolio” in chapter  XXX .     5.7 Key facilitation tools   5.7.1 Warm-ups  Warm-ups can be enormously valuable or a colossal waste of time and good will  see  chapter XXX for some warm-ups we like to use . They can help to “break the ice” in a  group, help members get to know each other, get people comfortable in a space, make  ideation more effective, help teams let go of ideas, help people to be happy failing, and  wake people up in the natural low points of the day. Badly chosen or framed, they can  also cost you the respect and consent of the group.    If possible, pick warm-ups which have a secondary affect, and explain the thinking  behind your choice after the warm-up. Some warm-ups, for example, are great models  of communication patterns or show us valuable behaviour for group cooperation. Others  demonstrate a point. Nearly all of them are ideation boosters.    Rather than doing warm-ups automatically at the start of the day and after lunch, think  about placing them more carefully. A powerful warm-up can be a great way to start  opening a “safe space”, perhaps after the introductory talks are over and the VIPs have  left. For a better ideation result, give the challenge first, then move straight into a warm- up which demands complete concentration. This will stop them thinking about the  challenge for a few minutes, and this has a proven positive effect17 on the ideation  which follows. And people are usually pretty fresh directly after lunch, so make space  for a warm-up an hour later instead, when they are really battling their biorhythm.    Combine warm-ups with other functions to be doubly efficient; rearranging the room into  a new configuration is a great way to mark a new step in the process. Add some fun  music and a tight deadline and it becomes a great warm up too  the same goes for  tidying the space . Or instead of boring introduction rounds, have the participants map  out their organisation, skills or physical world by where they stand in the room - “Here is  the centre of the city, that way is north. Stand where you live. Did you know you were  neighbours? Where’s the best place for coffee in your neighbourhood.”,  “Map out your                                                    17 Reference here, italian restaurant test      organisation in by standing with people you cooperate with … who connects your  groups?… who is missing?”. “Stand in a line according to how long you have worked in  this field … look at the other end of the line. What could they teach you?” A game like  3518  also called Benny Hill Sorting  is a highly efficient work process that also works as  a warm-up. If you have one of these activities coming soon, a warm-up might not be  necessary.     TEXTBOX Warm-up tip from Adam – I prefer warm-ups with a physical, spacial and  mental component, and with a fun-factor. If people are concentrated, moving and  laughing, it’s going to be a good warm-up. And if we are having fun failing, we show a  shared humanity and open a door to successful failure in our work.         Image: “3 Brain, a warm-up with physical, cognitive and spacial elements.        5.7.2 Timing  One of the most powerful tools of the facilitator is time. Use deadlines throughout the  day to keep the team moving forward and to adjust the level of detail and polish in their  work. Very tight or “impossible” deadlines can help teams avoid wasting time on talking                                                    18 Thiagi's 100 Favorite Games, Sivasailam Thiagarajan, Pfeiffer & Co 2006    too much. Time pressure will encourage them to go for quantity instead of quality,  staying away from considering detail too early in the process – the Sh!tty First Drafts  mentioned earlier in this chapter.    An occasional countdown through a task will help teams use their time wisely and keep  up energy in the room, and counting out the last seconds  or playing a “time’s up” song  with a clear end  means no-one gets stopped mid-sentence. If a deadline must cut  people off in mid presentation, find a supportive way to interrupt – a vigorous round of  applause hurts least.    TEXTBOX Interruptions by Adam  At one event, the facilitators had chosen a “make a wish” metaphor for the session, and  used a tinkling fairy sound played quietly from a phone whenever they wanted attention.  If necessary, they would play it several times until the room was listening. It was gentle  and playful sound which took a few seconds to notice, meant no-one had to raise thier  voice, and also reminded us of the metaphor of the day every time we heard it.    But be careful with these “impossible deadlines”. They are very powerful up to a certain  point, but we cannot cut the amount of time for a task at will. Under a certain time, the  task becomes meaningless and the participants will know that. Instead, play around with  deadlines and see what works for your group. Give three minutes and they will gasp but  knuckle down. Give ten minutes and they will expect fifteen, but give eight minutes and  they will focus. Give twenty minutes and they will step out to fetch a coffee first; give  eighteen or twenty one and they might not.    And not everything can be done at a sprint. A project also needs slower times for  reflection, recovery and to make a satisfying dramatic arc  see chapter XX .    TEXTBOX: Timing tip from Markus – Don't have a visible clock in the room, especially  one with a second hand. If there is no clock visible, you can use “liquid” time – secretly  shorten deadlines to add pressure and increase energy; secretly lengthen deadlines if  important discoveries are made or people have trouble with a task. If you hold up a sign  saying “3 minutes to go”. Participants will not notice if you stop them 3 minutes, 2  minutes or 5 minutes after showing the sign.     5.7.3 The Room  The room itself is one of the most important tools of a facilitator. We will talk about  dedicated spaces for service design in Chapter XXX, but let’s consider temporary  spaces here.       It’s easy to consign this kind of work to expensive offsite locations with a “creative  atmosphere” that help us “think outside the box”; but ask yourself what message that  sends. It signifies that service design or indeed creativity is detached from everyday  concerns, and can only take place in a rarified and specialised environment. It’s far  more interesting, useful  and sustainable  to take a normal conference room and  transform it into a more flexible and stimulating space. It suggests that we can do this  anytime and anywhere, and means that our colleagues’ expertise and experience is just  a short walk away. In one project, we worked on shopping centre customer experience  using an empty retail unit in the centre itself as our studio. Research meant literally  stepping outside the door.    If you have a choice of rooms, think about light, privacy and flexibility. Everyone loves  light and air, and facilitation in a low-ceilinged, gloomy room is always much more  difficult as the day wears on. But no-one wants to work in a fishbowl either, and a  feeling of being “on display” can seriously inhibit creativity while vistas of glass cost you  valuable wallspace. So if the room is very glassy, encourage participants to use the  glass as a work and display surface, and perhaps hang blank paper at eye-height to  shield them until the windows fill up.    Experiments19 have found that the most effective furniture for creative groups was a  combination of high tables and bar stools – they are restful for the legs but they also  make it easier for people to get up and move around.  A flexible selection is ideal, with  light but sturdy furniture which can be moved quickly and even folded away.  Rearranging the room several times throughout the day helps punctuate the activities  and mark the process, as well as mixing up groups and breaking up hardening social  structures in the space. If they do it themselves, it also helps the participants “own” the  space  see Safe Space, earlier in this chapter .    TEXTBOX Tip Adam on The Room: If high tables and barstools are not available  often  they are not, but talk to the staff restaurant , ask yourself if you even need chairs in the  main workspace. I enjoy working in a fluid “standing” space with some tables near the  walls to perch on and perhaps a few chairs for those who really need them. Ideally,  there would be a comfortable sitting area for reflective phases nearby.     5.7.4 Tools and props  Tools and other tangible items can enrich a room. One way is to have a core toolkit   standard pens, scissors, knives, tape, notepaper, sticky notes  on each workspace,  and a central pool of shared resources like templates, cardboard, building bricks,                                                     19  Make Space: How to Set the Stage for Creative Collaboration, Doorley and Witthoft, Wiley 2012     figurines and other prototyping material. You can add to the mix by spreading some  random portable objects around the room – toys, gadgets, ornaments, puzzles, even  little bits of costume  or rubber chickens . It’s startling how often they become part of an  idea or prototype, and in themselves they can help establish safe space by prompting  other playful, curious, empathic or experimental mindsets. It’s worth remembering that  some people simply think better if they have something in their hand20.    You can never have enough wall space in a room  read more on this in chapter XXX:  making space . Participants should keep their material visible by hanging it on the wall,  letting them constantly discover new connections and trace ideas back to their origin in  research insights. This eats wall space very fast, so it can be helpful to expand it with  wheeled pinboards or simply big sheets of cardboard which can be moved around fast,  leaned against tables, and laid to one side when not needed. If the space is very high,  think about using a ladder to have another row of older work or key material hanging  high above the active area. It’s a great visual reference and stimulus, but it’s never in  the way.     5.7.6 Visualisation  With so much service design DNA coming from the world of product and graphic design,  visualisation will always have a key place in the design process. Appropriate visuals  speed up the process, allow for easy iterations, and get people on the same page very  quickly. Compare a 4-page text document with many open questions to 10 quick  sketches: only the latter will help you in a workshop setting. Visuals help enormously to  make things tangible, helping participants move away from theoretical thinking into  practical doing. Not least, you will rely on documentation after your workshops, and  visualisations of any quality will be extremely helpful and authentic in this context.    Several key tools are primarily visualisations, from customer journey maps to value  network maps. And many facilitators encourage team members to be visual – for  example sketching ideas instead of writing them. A sketch contains more information  than a short sentence, forces more concrete thinking, and can be misunderstood in very  productive ways.    If you want participants to draw, don’t show them your exquisitely drafted flip charts first.  Use scrappy visuals yourself and tell them that stick figures are welcome, or give them  a crash course in simple visualisation techniques. And encourage them over and over                                                     20  Michael Karlesky and Katherine Isbister.

You can use visualisations yourself to help teams through the project. A visual overview  of the whole project process prominently displayed on the wall can reassure participants  of their progress when everything seems confusing. And many tasks are best explained  by sketching out the steps and deliverables as a quick storyboard or mind map, and by  showing examples.       5.7.7 Post It or Lose It – The Expert’s Guide to Sticky Notes  If there is one tool which has become the epitome of service design it is surely the sticky  note. Search for service design workshop or design thinking on an image search and  you will find thousands of pictures of people pointing at yellow, green, pink and orange  squares.    Image: sticky notes     In fact, sticky notes are enormously useful – they hold a bite-sized piece of information  and let us organise and sequence it easily, then change our mind.  But they can be  even more powerful if we use them intelligently.         Encourage participants to both chose and mark their sticky note consciously, not just  grab the nearest one. Encourage them to use one colour and size of note, and one  colour and thickness of pen for the same level of information.  Make this easier for them  by only having one type of pen in the room and specifying the note colour for each  task.  This lets you use other colours and sizes for other levels of information like group  headings and themes. It also makes it easier to find connections and groupings within  the clusters of notes.    If you use many colours, shapes and pen sizes, your subconscious will furiously search  for patterns in the format, not the content. This happens even if your conscious mind  knows that the format is meaningless.    On the second day of a workshop, or after lunch, the floor will be usually be littered with  notes which have fallen off the wall. It’s annoying and it costs us data. Sure, we  photographed them the night before, but who is going to pull up the pictures and start  looking for one note? Instead, teach your class to pull sticky notes correctly so they stick  better. Holding the pad in your hand, don’t lift the note towards your face, curling the  paper. Instead, snap down towards your belly so the note comes away flat.   Alternatively, for example when the pad is thin, peel from the back of the pad . A flat  note will stay on the wall far longer.    >>> TEXTBOX Tip from Adam: I use my sticky notes one-colour-at-a-time like this, as it  seems to work best. Other colleagues use wild mixes of colours and pens to create a  colourful chaos when they think the group needs this shock treatment or craves a  release from grey thinking. That’s a great and valuable point, but the cost of the  colourful inspiration is a slower process, and irritation for some people who like  structure.     5.7.8 Space, distance and positioning  As a facilitator, one of your most powerful tools is your own body and physicality. The  entire room is a three-dimensional stage which you can use in many different ways. Do  you sit with the participants, hover near them, or have your own territory? When will you  step firmly into the centre to get attention and focus, or withdraw into a corner to let  them get on with it? You can fade into the group to observe something together, or stay  at the front to present it to them. You can stand closer to one person to help her pay  attention – even step into her personal space  directly behind her is most effective  or if  appropriate lay a hand on her shoulder to really make the point.      Be conscious of relative height as well – there are times when you should stand when  the group sits, times when you should sit or stand with them, times you should sit while  they stand. When would you stand on a chair, squat beside someone, even sit on the  floor? When do you take eye contact, when do you let it slip away? When do you  spread out your arms, or put your head in your hands?       Image: a facilitator uses height and position to interrupt and manage group     Much of positioning strategy comes down to two basic arrangements called parallel or  triangular positioning. Parallel positioning is where two people  or two groups, or a  person and a group  stand or sit directly facing each other, their shoulders forming two  parallel lines. It is the position of the interviewee to the interviewer  or the police officer ,  the two negotiation teams, the two shouting tough guys about to fight. This is an  unnatural and uncomfortable position which feels confrontational. Triangular positioning  is different. The two parties stand at two points of a triangle with facing the third point.  The third corner is the material being discussed, the challenge, the problem. It is a more  cooperative position, like two friends fishing in one ice hole, or mechanics discussing  how to fix a dent in a car.    You can understand the difference between the parallel and triangular positions with a  small thought experiment. Imagine standing parallel, face to face with someone who  thrusts a document at your chest and says, “Someone screwed up here!”. You will feel    accused, confronted, defensive. Now imagine the two of you standing side-by-side by a  table. Your partner slams the document down on the table with just the same  vehemence and says the same four words in the same tone as before. As the two of  you look at the document you know there is tension, but you feel that the two of you  have a common problem, and you will approach it together.    This is not to say that a parallel position is always bad, or a triangular one is always  good. Sometimes a parallel position can give authority, like the judge in court or the  nightclub doorman. It can be a powerful position to take charge of a group, to call a halt  to unacceptable behaviour, or to punctuate the day.     5.7.9. Feedback  Feedback  covered in detail in chapter XXX  is a very versatile facilitation tool. Team  feedback “in passing” from a facilitator or mentor can help teams stay on track, break  deadlocks or quietly suggest methods and tools which can take the process forward.  More public feedback - perhaps from the whole room or from visitors - can give a team  a broad selection of news ideas and input, and can also be used to punctuate the day,  to give teams something to work towards and to force them to make provisional  decisions.  Feedback sessions can be weighted differently to fit your needs. To keep teams on  track and to diversify their options, keep feedback low key. Perhaps simply ask for “a  one minute status report in five minutes”.  Teams will see this as a brief interruption in  their workflow and an opportunity to get some input, but will not see it as a goal in itself,  or a “gate” in the process.  To encourage the teams to filter and converge their ideas more strongly and perhaps  make some tough decisions, present the feedback opportunity as a more significant  event. Rather than asking for a spontaneous status report, warn teams well in advance  that they will be asked to pitch or present their idea more formally to the group, to  another team or to a visitor.   Feedback can be enormously time consuming, especially if open feedback methods  lead to discussion. When planning, remember that closed feedback methods are faster.  If there are several teams, decide if they get feedback in parallel  for example by pairing  teams  or in series  for example in plenum .     TEXTBOX Adam: Feedback as a gate or hurdle  To make a feedback round into a real point of convergence, hold a “Dragon’s Den” or  “Shark Tank” session with visiting experts. These are especially effective if the session  is quite formal and takes place in a separate room where the team is alone with the  experts and perhaps a facilitator. Other groups should be excluded, to strengthen the    impression that the feedback will be especially tough and honest. Teams can be quite  shell-shocked after this experience, so don’t end a session with this.     5.7.10. Status  It is not necessary or even advisable to dominate the group all the time when facilitating,  but neither is it helpful to always give the group what they want. A facilitator’s unique  role as a leader of the process and a servant of the group gives him the ability to use his  status as a tool, varying it as needed. The ability to elegantly move along a spectrum  between “high” and “low” status can be a crucial tool and form part of a facilitator’s  personal style. Our choice of words and use of artefacts can play a part, but because  we are monkeys, much of this can be done with voice and three-dimensional positioning  in the room.   At your next trip to the zoo, spend some time watching the baboons. The one sitting  still, high up on the rock and looking everyone in the eye is the boss. He’s a real power- dresser, with broad shoulders, laconic loud voice and head held high. Around him we  have all the guys looking busy, chattering and stealing sideways glances at him and at  each other. And at the edges, we have the youngsters playing and one or two smaller  individuals who sit quietly with their backs bent, eyes on the floor. That’s about all you  need to know about status in one scene. There are always exceptions, and a lot will  depend on your own physical stature, gender and personal style in the context of your  local culture. But as a rule, to raise your perceived status, go physically higher up  stand  closer or straighter to seem higher , look at people directly, keep movements purposeful  and speak in shorter, firm phrases and words. To decrease your perceived status, go  lower, look down, move aimlessly or fidget, speak quietly and don’t finish your  sentences.    It’s important to remember that taking a low status does not mean surrendering control  of the process  even if you claim you are doing exactly that . This is not about how  much you control, but about giving participants the impression of having more or less  freedom themselves, and finding ways out of a some categories of conflict. Sometimes,  it is useful to go lower status to regain control. Table XXX  needs a snappy title like  Status-Control Matrix  makes this clear, showing how we can keep a tight or loose rein  on a process from different status levels21.                                                       21 Developed by Samuel Pickands with Adam Lawrence, based on experiences as a military officer and nightclub doorman,  respectively.         TEXTBOX Using low status to keep control  In one design session, the facilitator felt he was losing control of the group and the  situation was getting critical. Raising his status would have led to confrontation in that  context, so he went low. From a standing position, he sighed and slumped suddenly into  a chair, scanned the floor with his eyes, fiddled with his pen, and then looked up at the  group with a hangdog expression. “You guys are killing me today,” he said quietly.  “What do you suggest I do? Shall I cancel the session for today, or,… well,…  shrug .”   After letting the group react – mostly by looking at each other in silence - he began to  take control of the situation again by saying, “Is there any reason we can’t move past  this today? Are there any facts we don’t have? OK, so … what can I do which will help  us crack this in the next half an hour?” In effect, he consciously crashed from peer  status down to very low status, then moved through the bottom row of the XXX table,  from left  low status, low control  to right  low status, high control .     5.7.11 Doing, not talking  At Stanford’s D-School, one of the core beliefs is a “bias towards action22”. At the Global  Service Jam23, where thousands of people in a hundred cities try to create new services  in just a few hours, the cry is a simpler one: “doing, not talking”.    As well as being a great way to keep moving forwards, this attitude can help a facilitator  in many critical situations. Often, an efective way to break past a creative or  interpersonal lock-up is to change the working method or communication channel –  leaving the verbal and switching to other ways forward.    Table XXX is from the material which the Global Service Jam gives to its volunteer  hosts. It suggests alternate, “doing” ways to keep a process moving. For example, if a  team is arguing about which of two ideas is the best, Jammers would split the team into                                                     22 See eg. https:  dschool.stanford.edu groups k12 wiki 548fb Bias_Toward_Action.html  23 See www.globalservicejam.org    two subteams and have each one build a quick and dirty prototype of the ideas. This  usually makes the discussion redundant, as the prototypes quickly show that the ideas  are mutually compatible, that one is clearly better, or often that both groups meant  basically the same thing.          In a “doing not talking” mindset, ideas are generally evolved by pragmatically iterating  on the prototype, instead of making hypothetical leaps through discussion. A “bias  towards action” in any co-creative session will usually keep things moving more  smoothly, as well as giving more opportunity to the team members who are less verbally  dominant.    Of course, group work will always be a combination of doing and talking, but facilitators  can play with the balance and with the sequence. Do you talk first, then build? Or do  you build first, then talk? Experiment and see what works for you.       5.8 Growing as a facilitator       Facilitation is a complex and challenging theme, to which some people dedicate a  lifetime. But as a practicing service designer, facilitation will always be a key factor in  your success or failure. As you work, you will invariably discover and experiment with  different facilitation styles and techniques. You can even look outside your own  discipline and consciously learn from other facilitation experts, such as Agile coaches,  therapists, sports coaches, hosts of Jams and other innovation events, practitioners of  Applied Improvisation, and many more.  It’s also valuable - and appreciated - to ask  participants for feedback on your facilitation style after each session or project.    As you spread service design thinking through your organisation or professional  context, you will find yourself teaching others to facilitate, and develop a community of  practice not just for design tools and methods, but also for facilitation. You will find that  every facilitator is different, and that what works for one will not work for others.  Embrace this diversity - we can all learn from each other as we develop our own styles  of facilitation.               Discussing Design Real critique has become a lost skill among teams today.  Critique is intended to help teams strengthen their  designs, products, and services, rather than be used  to assert authority or push agendas under the guise  of “feedback.” In this practical guide, Adam Connor  and Aaron Irizarry teach you techniques and tools for  helping members of your team give and receive critique. Using firsthand lessons from prominent figures in  the design community, this book examines the good,  the bad, and the ugly of feedback. You’ll come away  with tips, actionable insights, and activities for making  critique a part of your collaborative process.  Topics Include:  ! Best practices  and anti-patterns  for giving   and receiving critique   ! Cultural aspects that influence your ability   to critique constructively   ! When, how much, and how often to use   critique in the creative process   ! Facilitation techniques for making critiques   timely and more effective    ! Strategies for dealing with difficult people   and challenging situations  Adam Connor, VP of Organizational Design at Mad*Pow,  helps teams improve their own ability to create and   collaborate effectively. Aaron Irizarry, Director of User Experience for Nasdaq  Product Design, provides workshops to help product teams  improve the discussion around product design.  “ I have personally been   able to leverage many of  the valuable insights and  takeaways they shared  with my team at Disney  to structure formal  design critique sessions,  and it has helped to make  our design process even   more effective.”—Priyanka Kakar  User Experience Director   at The Walt Disney Company  “ Adam and Aaron are   creating a great dialogue  around the importance  of critique and how to  do it well.

Diversity is an important aspect in creative collabo- ration. These differences between teammates means that we can draw  inspiration from a wider array of possibilities; we have more material  with  which  to  build  connections,  increasing  our  chances  of  ﬁnding  new, innovative solutions to the challenges we’re trying to solve.  Yet,  bringing  people  together  in  this  way  also  means  we  need  to  be  aware of and prepared for the challenges that are bound to arise. Take  a  group  of  individuals,  put  them  together,  and  give  them  problems  to  solve,  constraints,  and  deadlines,  and  it  becomes  inevitable  that  we  will  run  into  situations  in  which  communication  becomes  a  bit  rough. Team members will disagree or people will misunderstand one  another while discussing their ideas and designs, sometimes making  things uncomfortable and slowing down the task to which you’ve been  assigned.  This is perfectly normal. In no way does the presence of these chal- lenges mean that we should cease collaborating. The fact of the matter  is  that  regardless  of  how  much  effort  we  put  into  setting  up  conver- sations and critiques the right way, there will be situations for which  things  simply  don’t  go  according  to  plan.  Occasionally,  there  will  be  people who don’t participate in a productive manner for any number  of reasons.  When these situations arise, the key is to identify where or when it is  happening, identify the source, and work to understand what the indi- vidual s  is trying to communicate.  143   Chapter 5 looks at some key techniques and best practices for facilitat- ing these discussions, whether they are with our teams or with clients,  and discusses focusing feedback on critique in order to produce anal- ysis  that’s  useful  to  moving  a  design  forward.  But  the  question  still  looms, “What do I do when others don’t follow these suggestions or  best practices?”  We might ask for critique and instead receive a list of requested changes.  Or,  we  might  get  back  a  description  or  drawing  of  the  solution  that  someone else thinks we should have come up with. We might get com- ments like, “This is horrible” or “Great work!” that leave us with very  little understanding as to whether our designs might actually meet our  objectives. And, we can expect that at some point in our careers as sure  as the sky is blue we will encounter someone with whom it is just plain  difﬁcult to converse.  It should be noted that not every person providing less-than-useful feed- back is doing so with underhanded, world-domination driven motives.  Some  individuals  are  trying  to  be  helpful  but  are  going  about  it  the  wrong way. For most situations, we’ve found that although our initial  reaction to these situations might be negative or defensive, it’s import- ant  to  recognize  that  the  feedback  we  receive  from  others  might  be  founded in something that’s worthwhile to understand. Even though  we can’t stop unclear or negative criticisms, we can change our per- spective and try to ﬁnd something of value in them.  Dealing with Difficult People Certainly, we’d all prefer not to work with “difﬁcult people,” but they  can’t always be avoided. Some might be difﬁcult because they’re quiet  and difﬁcult to extract information from. Some can be difﬁcult because  it’s not easy for them to communicate the points they’re trying to get   144     DISCUSSING DESIGN  Central Idea There  are  going  to  be  times  when  conversations  and  situations  become  challenging for a variety of reasons. Be prepared for them and don’t lose  heart. Understanding the situation you’re in is the ﬁrst step to forming a  plan to work through these challenges.   across.  Others  might  be  difﬁcult  because  they  have  attitudes,  inten- tions, or motivations that don’t align with the principles of good cri- tique or collaboration.  Whatever the reason, having tactics for working with and getting use- ful feedback from people like this is important.  SETTING THE RIGHT EXPECTATIONS Sometimes, difﬁculties arise when people have different expectations  about what they’re being asked to do or how to do it. Addressing this  is pretty straightforward. As is discussed in Chapter 5, making sure  participants are aware of the format of the critique and how you plan to  facilitate it is important in and of itself. It becomes even more import- ant for situations in which we think some participants might present  challenges.  It might seem a bit like overkill, but prefacing critiques like this can  be truly helpful when participants or exchanges become challenging.  Specifying the rules, structure, and focus for the critique at the outset  can act as a preventative measure by encouraging people to pay more  attention to how they participate and contribute to the critique.  Additionally,  by  communicating  the  rules  of  critique  and  specifying  what  we  plan  to  focus  our  conversation  on   see  Chapter  5   ahead  of  time or at the beginning of the meeting, we have something to refer  back to if during the course of the critique someone begins straying  outside the rules or focus. As a facilitator, this strengthens our ability  to address challenges as they arise and, by extension, keep critiques a  safe, comfortable environment for our teams to discuss their designs  and perspectives.  Along these lines, as we’ve mentioned before, posting the rules for cri- tique in the meeting invite and the meeting room itself so that team  members can become familiar with them and refer to them easily is  very helpful, as is posting or documenting the speciﬁc goals and focus  of the conversation.  AVOIDING PERSONAL PREFERENCES AND MOTIVATIONS As discussed in Chapter 3, many project teams and organizations that  have trouble collecting useful feedback suffer from not having a com- mon foundation, a set of decisions that frame and form the objectives  of the product.   6. CRITIQUING WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE AND CHALLENGING SITUATIONS     145   Having an agreed upon and mutually understood set of goals, princi- ples, personas, and scenarios not only provides for more useful and rel- evant critique, it also serves as a great tool for refocusing conversations  on the product and away from criticism that is rooted in personal pref- erence or misaligned motivations.  Depending on the details of the critique we receive, we can ask the indi- vidual to frame it in relation to a goal, scenario, principle, or persona.  For example, consider the following dialogue:  Critic:  There  are  too  many  things  to  click  on  this  screen!  I  think  we  should move some to other screens. It’s too confusing.  Designer:  OK.  Can  you  tell  me  a  little  more  about  your  concern?  Is  there a particular persona or scenario that this is likely to be problem- atic for?  Critic: Any of them. There’s just too much… I dunno, maybe the service  rep. If I was a service rep on a call with a customer I wouldn’t be able to  ﬁnd what I need to click on with all of these options.  Designer: Great. Let’s think more about that. We know that when a call  comes in, CSRs are trying to handle the customer’s request as quickly  as they can. And part of the issue in the current scenario is that the  options they need are buried within too many different screens.  Critic: Yes, but there’s just so much going on here. I’m concerned they  won’t know where to click.  Designer: OK, so it sounds like you want to make sure that the options  are well organized so that CSRs can ﬁnd them as quickly as possible.  Is that accurate?  In this example, by pulling in the foundational elements of the CSR  persona  and  information  from  a  scenario  involving  their  use  of  the  screen being discussed, we’re able to take what might start off seem- ing  like  personal  opinion  and  bring  it  to  a  concern  that  we  can  fur- ther discuss in the critique and, if relevant, work to address in the next  iteration.  This also highlights the importance of knowing about our product’s  users  and  their  needs,  behaviors,  and  so  on.  Having  solid,  relevant  research that we can reference is a great way to make sure your cri- tiques stay grounded.  146     DISCUSSING DESIGN   PREVENTING SURPRISES FROM QUIET PARTICIPANTS Why can quiet people be difﬁcult? Because sometimes they’re a ticking  time bomb.  OK, maybe that’s a bit alarmist, but we’ve seen quiet people be prob- lematic on more than one occasion. Sometimes, these individuals have  something valuable to share, but for any number of reasons they don’t  share  it  during  the  session  or  even  with  you  at  all.  There  are  times  when this silence is a result of someone feeling overwhelmed by the  process and subject matter. Other times it mght be because they are  afraid to provide information that might be considered “wrong.”  Instead, they share it with someone else, perhaps another teammate or  a manager, and then the comment travels person to person until ﬁnally  making its way back to you, days or even weeks later when you might  no longer be able to act upon it.  When collecting feedback in a meeting, look for people who are not say- ing much. Take steps to ensure that they have opportunities to share  their thoughts by asking them for feedback, directly if necessary, and  try to make them feel more comfortable. It can be useful to frame the  feedback request as something relevant to their speciﬁc expertise or  skillset.  Be cautious, though: you don’t want to overwhelm people by continu- ously putting pressure on them to contribute. If you get the sense that  an individual just hasn’t found something useful to say, leave it at that.  It could be that they’re just quiet or shy, and your best approach could  be to try to talk with the person one on one after the session.   6. CRITIQUING WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE AND CHALLENGING SITUATIONS     147  Central Idea Addressing difficulties that come up during the course of a conversation  entails  being  able  to  identify  issues  and  having  tools  to  address  them.  Setting up conversations with shared references such as rules, objectives,  focus, and so on provides a foundation for us to use throughout the critique.   USING LADDERING TO EXPAND ON FEEDBACK Ever hung out with a child around the age of 3 to 6? If so, then you  know  what  it’s  like  to  be  asked  the  question  “Why?”  over  and  over  again. Children often do this when trying to get adults to explain chal- lenging concepts to them.  The  repeated  asking  of  the  question  “Why?”  can  be  used  to  help  an  individual to gradually get more speciﬁc or provide more details about  a subject. Laddering, a technique commonly used in design research,  uses  the  repeated  asking  of  “Why?”  in  various  forms  to  understand  the cause or rationale behind a statement made by an interview par- ticipant.  Speciﬁcally,  with  each  answer  the  individual  provides,  we  respond with a form of the question “Why?” as a way to get him to pro- vide more information until we reach a logical stopping point. A simi- lar method, called the “5 Whys,” is often used in projects to determine  the root cause of a problem to be solved.  This same basic technique can be applied in design discussions when  we want to understand more about the feedback someone is giving and  why they’re giving it. This is especially helpful when someone provides  feedback that we sense may be related to her personal preference. By  asking her “Why?” progressively, we’re likely to get one of two potential  results:     As we continue to ask questions about the feedback she has shared,  we will uncover details about what she is trying to communicate in  a way that ties back to the objectives of the product. Or…     We may lead her to realize that her feedback is based more on her  personal preference and motivations rather than the objectives of  the product and therefore it should be left alone and the conversa- tion can move on.  For example:  Stakeholder: I think we should use less blue in the design.   Designer: What is it about the design that is leading you to think that?  Stakeholder: It’s too much. If I squint my eyes, blue is the dominant  color.  148     DISCUSSING DESIGN   Designer: Why is it important that blue not be the dominant color in  the design?  Stakeholder:  We’re  trying  to  stand  out  from  our  competitors,  and  almost all of their sites are some shade of blue.  The way you ask “Why?” is very important to the success of this tech- nique. In some situations the simple question of “Why?” can be seen as  interpreted as aggressive or accusatory, and that sense can become sig- niﬁcantly stronger with repetition. So it’s recommended that you work  toward wording your why’s in a way that is more akin to an invite for  the individual to continue sharing.   ATTEMPTING DIFFERENT DYNAMICS: ONE-ON-ONE   CONVERSATION People’s behaviors and attitudes in a conversation can change depend- ing on the size of the group conversing as well as the people who make  up the group. Sometimes, it’s these factors that are the cause for some- one to be difﬁcult to work with in a feedback discussion.  People can become uncomfortable or intimidated by large groups or a  subject matter  design  with which they are not very familiar, so they  withdraw.  Others  might  try  to  dominate  a  conversation.  Some  peo- ple will have strong or combative personalities and become disruptive  during  critiques.  As  you  work  with  your  teams  and  clients,  observe  how they communicate and interact with others and make note of any  concerns so that you are aware of them before you get into a meeting  or critique with them.  Adam and I have found that in cases for which you know or suspect  someone might have these kinds of challenges—they might have difﬁ- culty speaking up in groups, or they can be intimidating to a fair num- ber of team members, preventing them from speaking up—reaching  out to these individuals in advance to analyze the work with them alone  and  collect  their  feedback  can  prevent  tough  situations  during  the  group critique.   6. CRITIQUING WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE AND CHALLENGING SITUATIONS     149   First, by talking with them prior to the meeting, we will have already  discussed the designs, which for individuals who have a tendency to  intimidate others can lead them to not be as vocal during the meet- ing.  This  is  because  they  have  already  provided  insights,  which  can  preclude opportunities for them to be difﬁcult or disruptive during a  session. Alternatively, if they do become challenging in the critique, we  can refer back to the feedback and any agreements from your prior con- versation with them and keep them accountable to those commitments.  We  have  also  found  that  talking  to  these  types  of  participants  in  advance can often make them feel that they have received your atten- tion and have been heard. As a result, they sometimes feel that they can  then forego attending the group critique, which can be helpful if their  presence  might  have  hindered  other  participants  from  giving  useful  feedback.  Coping with Challenging Situations Difﬁcult people can show up at any time in any environment. We’ve  already talked about some strategies for working with them, but hope- fully, as you read the previous sections and thought about your own  experiences,  you’ve  realized  that  in  many  cases,  it  isn’t  the  person  themselves that is inherently difﬁcult, it’s the situation or the way in  which certain individuals deliver their feedback.  Here are some common situations that we’ve observed in the organi- zations we’ve worked with and some techniques for working through  them.  150     DISCUSSING DESIGN  Central Idea To deal with issues that can come up in a critique, you need to know what  kinds of questions to ask as well as knowing when to ask them, even if that  means doing it as part of a separate discussion.   CRITIQUING THE WORK OF SOMEONE AVERSE TO CRITICISM Sometimes, the difﬁcult situation lies not in receiving feedback, but  giving it. As we know and have discussed, receiving feedback can be  hard to do without taking it personally. Some people will take it better  than others.  If we know that the individual whose work we need to analyze has trou- ble with receiving critique because they tend to get defensive or feel  defeated, how do we go about making it easier for her? We don’t want  to hold back our comments. We need to be truthful. But we also need  to show tact to keep the momentum and collaborative spirit of the team  going.  Chapter  2  shares  advice  for  giving  critique,  but  here  are  some  more  thoughts when the person you’re giving that critique to is particularly  sensitive to feedback.  Get them talking Engage  them.  Get  them  talking  about  the  design,  about  the  objec- tives of the product and the elements or aspects of the design that are  intended to achieve those objectives. For some people, receiving feed- back can cause them to freeze up or go silent. Get them talking and  thinking  critically  about  the  work  with  you.  Ask  questions.  Keep  it  casual and conversational.  As they talk more, most people tend to relax. As you ask questions and  they work to describe the design and provide more details, they’ll likely  begin to analyze the design and participate in the critique not just as  a  recipient,  but  as  a  critic  as  well,  which  tends  to  make  them  more  receptive.   Talk about the work, not the person With people who are particularly sensitive to feedback, it’s even more  important to ensure that the conversation you have and the language  you use center on the design and not the designer  see Figure 6-1 .   6. CRITIQUING WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE AND CHALLENGING SITUATIONS     151   FIGURE 6-1 A demonstration of how to frame questions and critique on the design rather  than the designer  152     DISCUSSING DESIGN   This can be tricky. In critiques we want to make sure that the discus- sion includes the thoughts and reasoning people used when making  design decisions. However, the more our questions seem to be about  the designer, the more individuals who are sensitive to feedback can  feel like the feedback is about them and not the design.  Emphasize that the critique is about iteration When you’re sensitive to feedback, it can be easy to forget that critique  is about iteration and that the reason for critiquing work is because you  plan to continue working on a design and use the insights taken from  the critique to make it stronger.  Remind the recipient of this if you can during the feedback. Let him  know that you’re curious to see what he comes back with in the next  iteration. If you’ve critiqued this work with him in the past, talk about  how things have improved over the past iterations.  The sandwich method The sandwich method is an often-talked-about method for delivering  negative feedback in management circles. In it, you begin by present- ing a piece of positive feedback, followed by the negative feedback you  have, followed by another piece of positive feedback.  The idea is that by starting off positive you give the recipient a sense  of success and support, so that when he receives the negative feedback  you’re about to follow up with, he doesn’t feel as bad about it and his  emotions don’t fall as far. Then, another piece of positive feedback lifts  his emotions again and, because there was more positive than negative,  he feels like he’s leaving with the scales tipped in a positive direction.  For as much anecdotal support as there is for the sandwich method,  there is also a lot of criticism and skepticism as well as research that  it doesn’t work, mostly because of how it’s often carried out. In many  cases, the positive comments are superﬁcial and or vague  Figure 6-2 .  They  might  be  about  a  quality  that  has  very  little  to  do  with  what’s  being discussed, or about no strength at all really.  Most people can see right through these kinds of comments and they  do little to help the situation. The initial praise or positive comment  does little more than signal that something bad is coming. Additionally,  because cognitively we expend more energy and attention processing    6. CRITIQUING WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE AND CHALLENGING SITUATIONS     153   negative  situations  than  positive  ones,  initial  positive  comments  are  forgotten as soon as negative comments are brought in. And for some,  the whole method can feel manipulative.  FIGURE 6-2 An example of a bad feedback sandwich  We strongly believe that balancing conversation around strengths and  weaknesses of a design is important in a critique. And we agree that  starting off on a positive note can be helpful in setting tone.  Most  important  though,  is  that  the  positive  comments  be  about  real  strengths  in  the  design   Figure  6-3 ;  they  should  be  aspects  that  we  have thought about critically and feel are effective and important to the  objectives of the project, not just things we came up with at the spur of  the moment to make a weakness we want to point out easier to handle.  Don’t worry about the “sandwich”. Be honest with the recipient. Balance  the conversation. Think critically about and discuss the elements of the  design that work for and against objectives. And don’t manipulate or  make up insights and feedback just to try and make things easier.  154     DISCUSSING DESIGN   FIGURE 6-3 An example of a balancing discussion of strengths and weaknesses  RECEIVING UNSOLICITED FEEDBACK If feedback only ever happened when we ask for it, would it ever hap- pen at all? The truth is feedback happens all the time whether we ask  for it or not. Sometimes, it’s conscious feedback, someone deliberately  responding to something we’ve done by making comments or sugges- tions or asking questions. Sometimes it’s subconscious. We might cre- ate or do something and notice a subtle change in someone’s demeanor  or behavior, or maybe a facial expression.   6. CRITIQUING WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE AND CHALLENGING SITUATIONS     155   Feedback is a regularly occurring and natural part of our interactions  with  others.  Whether  we’re  solo  creators  or  part  of  a  team  creating  something,  if  we  set  a  goal  of  wanting  to  improve  our  creations,  we  need to understand that feedback is constantly happening outside the  situations in which we’ve requested it. It’s up to us to recognize when  feedback is occurring, work to understand what that feedback is telling  us, and determine if it is useful in our work and whether we should pay  attention to it.  Step 1: Be ready Understanding  that  feedback  occurs  so  frequently  and  naturally,  it’s  best that we be proactive in thinking about how we want to handle it.  Before sharing your work, even if you have no plans to ask for it, think  about how you want to handle feedback. Spending a little time think- ing about how you’ll respond to compliments, questions, and critique  can go a long way, not only toward making those exchanges much more  useful to you as you iterate on your work, but also to helping you learn  how to separate yourself from your work.  Separating yourself from your work can be difﬁcult. You’ve put time  and energy into what everyone else is now going to analyze with a crit- ical eye. It’s intimidating. One thing that has helped Adam and me to  create this separation is remembering that critique is a tool that can  help us produce better work. The focus of the critique is the product,  not the person who created the work. If there is feedback that some- thing missed the mark, it is OK, and the chances are pretty good that  I am still an upstanding person. Critique is not about judgment, it is  about reﬁnement.  Step 2: Hold on to your reaction When unsolicited feedback to something you’ve created or presented  occurs—it might be verbal  someone saying or writing something  or  physical  a physical gesture via body language or facial expression — the ﬁrst thing to do is to hold back your initial reaction. It’s inevitable  that we’ll have a reaction, and the more passionate or pronounced the  feedback is to which we’re reacting, the stronger our reaction is likely  to be.  156     DISCUSSING DESIGN   What we need to do is give ourselves time to process the feedback and  decide what we want to do with it. Do we want to learn more about why  someone feels the way they do about the design? Would knowing it be  useful to us in improving the design? Are we in a position where we  could use that information?  Keep in mind that this applies for both positive and negative feedback.  Even though feedback is positive, it might not be helpful. Someone say- ing, “I like this” might make us feel good, but the question remains,  what  does  he  like?  People  will  often  offer  positive  feedback  because  they  don’t  want  to  hurt  someone’s  feelings,  not  necessarily  because  they think the work is heading in the right direction. With all feedback,  the best approach is to thank the individual for his feedback, be sure  that you understand what he is communicating, review his feedback  in  light  of  what  your  known  objectives  are,  and  then  follow  up  with  questions.  Step 3: Consider the source and intent What kind of feedback is it? Is it reaction, direction, or critique? Is it  constructive  or  destructive?   We’ll  talk  a  bit  more  speciﬁcally  about  working with reactive and directive feedback in the next two sections.   If we can get a read on what type of feedback we’re starting with, we can  get a better sense of how to dig deeper to get something of value from  it. The key question to ask though is “Why?” Asking “Why?” engages  the  critic  and  prompts  her  to  explain  and  even  rationalize  her  state- ments. Even feedback that might seem initially destructive can have  some legitimate analysis behind it.  This doesn’t mean that you should always engage with someone who  is tearing your work apart. You should think about the source itself. If  this is someone with a history of being a problem and you can ignore  her comments, you probably should. But it might be someone who has  something  worthwhile  to  tell  you  and  is  just  having  some  difﬁculty  moving past that initial reactionary phase of feedback. Asking “Why?”  often helps us see if this is the case.   6. CRITIQUING WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE AND CHALLENGING SITUATIONS     157   You should also consider the view from which her feedback is coming.  Is she speaking as a representative of the audience for whom you’ve cre- ated the design? Does she have expertise in a particular aspect touched  upon by your creation? Or maybe she’s just insightful? Again, the ques- tion “Why?” can help us determine the lens being used to derive the  feedback we’re receiving, making it possible for us to determine if we  should pay attention to it in our next iteration or not.  Step 4: Listen, understand, and use it If you’ve determined that the feedback might have something of use to  it, you’re next job is to listen. Pay attention. Be sure you really under- stand what you’re being told. Use active listening and question for clar- ity by repeating back what you’ve heard but worded differently.  And ﬁnally, just as with any solicited critique, you can factor these new  insights  into  your  next  iteration—assuming  that  you’ve  determined  they’re applicable.  DEALING WITH REACTIVE FEEDBACK  Well… it’s better than peanut butter and salami!  No kidding, Adam actually witnessed that feedback in a meeting. After  an awkward WTF moment in everyone’s heads as they looked around  the room at each other and wondered what a comment like that could  possibly  mean,  the  team  learned  that  it  deﬁnitely  wasn’t  positive.  It  roughly translated to, “It’s not the most heinous thing I’ve ever seen,  but it’s close.”  This  kind  of  feedback  is  bound  to  happen  at  some  point  in  time.  It  might not be as extreme as a noxious combination of sandwich ﬁllings.  You might just get a “meh” or maybe something on the positive side  like, “I love it!”  Remember that reactionary feedback comes from the more impulsive  of our mental processes. It can be positive or negative, and it can come  from one of a few different causes, as described in Chapter 1.  In general, though, this type of feedback is the result of an individual  expressing a gut reaction to what they are seeing. They haven’t taken  the time to think critically, moving past that initial reaction to examine  it and uncover the cause for it.  158     DISCUSSING DESIGN   And, as we’ve described, this kind of feedback isn’t very useful to us as  we work toward iterating and improving our creation. It doesn’t tell us  what aspects of our creation will or will not work to achieve our objec- tives. Therefore, it doesn’t help us identify which aspects of our cre- ation should be changed, explored further, or expanded upon.  There is, of course, the possibility that the critic is just being difﬁcult or  their personality makes it challenging to work with them. In this case,  it is natural to want to tell someone to kick rocks. Although this can  bring some temporary gratiﬁcation, it usually only complicates matters  in the end. It’s natural to grow defensive when criticism is coming our  way; we must resist that urge and focus on the best solution.  As with unsolicited feedback, sometimes people aren’t being trolls and  might actually have valuable insights. Look to ﬁnd the balance between  not feeding the trolls and not becoming defensive, and collecting infor- mation that might be useful as you iterate on your design.  The  only  way  to  get  someone  to  move  past  the  reactionary  phase  of  feedback is to ask questions that push him to examine not only his reac- tion, but also the creation you’re asking them to analyze. Remember, at  this point he’s really only just reacted. His slower, more analytical cog- nitive processes that facilitate critical thinking haven’t taken over yet.  By asking questions, we can help ensure that they do. By asking ques- tions, we can work toward exposing and understanding what it is that  led the individual to give his reaction. As we converse and try to gather  insights, we can then begin to determine if the individual is trying to  be helpful and maybe just going about it the wrong way or if he is troll- ing or voicing an opinion with no real desire to help.  It’s also important as you move through this process to pay attention  to how you word your questions. It’s important to try to word things in  such a way that they aren’t misconstrued as defensive and adversarial.  Instead, you’re looking to invite the individual to provide you with more  of his thinking.  Step 1: Get more speciﬁc The ﬁrst question to ask is pretty straightforward:   Can you tell me a bit more about what aspects of the design aren’t  working?   6. CRITIQUING WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE AND CHALLENGING SITUATIONS     159   Of course you’ll reword this depending on the speciﬁc reaction you’ve  received. The key point is to try to get her to be more speciﬁc. Get her  to focus on speciﬁc aspects or elements of the creation to which she is  reacting. This way, you can better focus the rest of the conversation by  discussing those aspects speciﬁcally, or perhaps the part of the design  that you’re interested in gathering feedback on is different from what  she’s reacting to, and so you can now try to steer her toward only paying  attention to that part of the design.  Step 2: Talk about the “whys” and “hows” Presuming  that  you’re  digging  deeper  into  the  critic’s  reaction   as  opposed to discovering that she’s reacting to something irrelevant to  what we’re trying to collect feedback on and refocusing the conversa- tion  the next step is to understand the following:     Why is are the aspect s  she is reacting to terrible?     How does that relate to the objectives of the design itself?  This is where having a solid foundation really matters. If the team has  already  agreed  upon  things  such  as  personas,  goals,  principles,  and  scenarios, you can ask people to relate their feedback to those founda- tional elements.  By  uncovering  this  information,  you  can  begin  to  get  to  the  core  of  what the individual’s problem with the design might be. Adam and I  have found that, oftentimes, using this approach you, together with the  critic, will be able uncover whether the feedback being given is perti- nent or a matter of the critic’s personal preference or motivations. By  doing so, you help the critic understand the process of critical thinking  so that in the future she’s better able to give critique.  It  isn’t  easy  to  discern  what  someone’s  motivations  are.  How  she  responds to the questions will help in understanding if she really is try- ing to help and just having a hard time communicating, or if she has  other motivations.  One way to work through these difﬁculties is to reinforce and remind  her that you are on the same team and working together. Use phrases  such  as,  “I  need  your  help  to  better  understand”  or  “We  really  want  to make sure this product meets its goals, and your help is crucial in   160     DISCUSSING DESIGN   accomplishing that.” By doing this we can move away from a me-ver- sus-you situation and put the focus on working together as a team to  resolve differences and focus on the needs of the products.  Most, but not all, individuals will be cooperative in these situations and  in those few cases of individuals who aren’t, it is best to move on. If  someone is nonresponsive to your attempts to reach out for clariﬁcation  or he does not get any less difﬁcult as the conversation progresses, this  is probably a sign that you will not be able to make much progress with  this person, and it will not be worth the time following up with him. In  these cases, it is OK to thank the person for his insights and move on,  focusing on collecting helpful insights on another topic or from others.  Take note of how this person interacted so that you know what to expect  from him in the future. In some cases, it might mean that you go about  collecting his feedback in another way. In others, in which the individ- ual is not a part of the project, it may mean that you exclude him from  future critiques.  In the end, we should strive to see if we can get any information that  can be used to improve the design by using some of the tips and tech- niques for facilitating critique we talk about in Chapter 5, even if we  don’t fully agree with an individual’s overall assessment. Although it is  not ideal when an individual’s intent is not coming from a position of  trying to be helpful, we can make the best of the situation by objectively  analyzing the feedback he is providing, looking for anything useful.  Remember, this applies to positive feedback as well When talking about feedback and criticism, it’s easy to ﬁxate on the  negative. When we think about problems with getting feedback, that’s  where our minds instinctively go: to all the times when someone has  berated us and told us our work is awful. Or, if it hasn’t happened yet,  we are consumed by the anticipation that it will one day, and what will  we do then.  Nonetheless, we need to remember that reactionary feedback can be  positive, too, even neutral. In these cases, even though our own reac- tions  to  the  feedback  we’re  receiving  might  not  be  so  negative—it  feels great when someone exclaims, “I love it” about something you’ve  made—the feedback itself is still unhelpful in providing us with infor- mation to use in iterating on and improving our creation.   6. CRITIQUING WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE AND CHALLENGING SITUATIONS     161   Thus, we still need to do our due diligence to ask questions and push  people to think critically about our design and their reaction. What do  they love about it? Why? How does it apply to our goals, personas, sce- narios, and principles?  DEALING WITH DIRECTIVE FEEDBACK Many of us have been in situations in which instead of getting what we’d  consider to be useful feedback on our designs, we get a list of changes  to make to it or suggestions on how we might improve it. Often, this list  doesn’t include a clear indication of why the changes should be made.  Beyond that, some of the changes might be things that are detrimental  to the design and things we’d advise against.  The most challenging, and possibly most frustrating, of these kinds of  situations is when we don’t receive actionable critique; instead, we get  a sketch or mockup for a new design that the person we’ve asked for  feedback has put together on her own.  We sit and stare at the screen with a million thoughts and questions  running through our heads and often a building sense of frustration  and insult.  How dare they!!! What do I do now?!?  Step 1: Calm down and let your reaction pass Step back and force yourself to remember that most people are not dia- bolical, intentionally hurtful people. You’re having a reaction right now,  an impulse. You aren’t thinking critically just yet. Remember that most  people are just trying to do the best job they can, and the chances are  that this individual is not trying to insult you.  Creating her own design is not necessarily an evil act. In fact, in most of  the situations I’ve encountered this scenario or observed other design- ers come up against it, it’s merely due to the individual ﬁnding it dif- ﬁcult to articulate everything she wanted to say about the design and  thinking it would be easier if she tried to show you.  Hmm… “Show me. Don’t tell me.” Who does that sound like?  Correct me if I’m wrong, but hasn’t the design community en masse  used that as a kind of mantra to describe the inefﬁciencies we often  encounter when trying to verbally describe things?  162     DISCUSSING DESIGN   Similarly, getting a list of changes back as feedback might just mean  that  the  individual  has  jumped  to  identifying  solutions  to  the  chal- lenges she perceives rather than articulating those challenges back to  you as feedback.  Of course, there is the possibility that the thinking behind the changes  the individual is proposing might be personally motivated. The next  steps  in  this  process  will  work  toward  helping  you  identify  if  that  is  the case. Even if it is, it can be worth working to understand what this  person is telling you, because you never know where a valuable insight  might come from.  Step 2: Take note Although she most likely isn’t trying to play the role of your archneme- sis, this does give you some insight into what your engagement might  be like if you continue to work with this individual, and in many cases,  you’ll have to.  It isn’t a bad thing. Good collaboration is rarely a natural occurrence.  It takes deliberate action and consideration from the people involved.  Getting a sense for how people share their thoughts and ideas can help  you tailor how you work with them and increase the efﬁciency of your  communications and idea-sharing back and forth.  Moreover,  in  the  off  chance  that  you’re  working  with  Satan  himself,  this might be one of your ﬁrst signs…  Step 3: Critique the directive feedback On your own, compare the contents and elements of the person’s work  or recommended changes and ask yourself the following:     How does his design differ from yours? What speciﬁc changes is   he proposing?     Why might he be proposing these changes? What is he trying to  achieve? What problems is he trying to solve and how is he trying  to solve them?     Did you try to solve for those same problems in your design? How?   How does your solution differ from his?     If you didn’t try to solve for some of those same objectives, why   not? Was it a deliberate omission on your part? An oversight?   6. CRITIQUING WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE AND CHALLENGING SITUATIONS     163      Looking at his proposed changes, what aspects of the design and  its elements might he be indicating are of primary importance to  him?  Make notes as you ask yourself these questions. But again, keep the  notes to yourself. By doing this, you give yourself some time to step  back and think objectively about what the individual might be trying  to tell you.  Step 4: Critique together Set up some time with the person who has sent you directive feedback  to discuss the designs or list of changes. Thank her for her feedback  and let her know that in order to reﬁne the design you’d like to discuss  some questions with her regarding the thinking behind the choices he  made.  In your discussion ask about the differences you noticed between your  design and her proposed changes and ask why he made or is recom- mending the change. Again, what problems is he trying to solve? What  was it about your design that she doesn’t think is sufﬁcient to solve that  same problem? If the solutions she’s designed are problematic in some  way  to  the  design  or  product—perhaps  because  they  go  against  best  practices or research—ask her about it.  Also,  ask  speciﬁcally  about  the  things  she  isn’t  recommending  be  changed or similarities between her design and yours. Why are they  there? Did she keep them for the same reasons you made them?  Now, because you’re going to be trying to facilitate this discussion as  a critique, you want to make use of any tools you have that will help.  Earlier in the project, did you establish agreed-upon personas and sce- narios? How about goals and design principles?  Are you all sick of us  mentioning these yet?   If you did, have them at the ready. These are the perfect foundation  for your discussion. Instead of just comparing the two designs to each  other, or your design with the critic’s list of changes, you can compare  them in regard to all of the things that the team had previously agreed  were important to the success of the product.  This  helps  remove  some  of  the  my-idea-versus-your-idea  atmosphere  that  might  be  present  and  helps  focus  the  conversation  on  what  the  right decisions are for the success of the product.  164     DISCUSSING DESIGN   If you don’t have these tools, this might be your opportunity to begin  to  generate  some.  As  you  discuss  why  he  made  decisions  and  learn  about the aspects of the solution that are most important to him and  his vision, you can talk about how this compares with the ﬁndings of  any research that’s been done, and possibly, on-the-ﬂy generate some  principles and goals that you can use to help focus discussions as the  project moves forward.  Now, maybe your project does have goals and principles deﬁned, but as  you’re going through the critique you’re ﬁnding that they really aren’t  helping. This can be a sign that the goals and principles you set are  too broad. Remember, when asking whether design options adhere to  a principle, more often the answer should be “no.” If your principles  and goals are too broad, this can be your chance to reﬁne them through  your discussion.  Goals  should  be  connected  to  something  measurable.  If  during  the  conversation you ﬁnd in trying to critique against a particular goal that  you have no way to meaningfully measure something to determine if  the goal has been achieved or not, you might need to reﬁne your goal.  In the course of your conversation, your goal is to essentially construct  a critique of your original proposed design using your critic’s design or  changes as a discussion tool. You should be able to learn which design  decisions you made that don’t quite work well enough to meet desired  objectives and aspects that are important to the product and the client  as  well  as  how  they  aren’t  working.  You  also  should  have  an  under- standing of the design decisions that are working.  Beyond that, if the individual you’re working with is a teammate, stake- holder, or client, you should also be looking to come away with a bet- ter understanding of her vision and thoughts on how speciﬁc design  challenges might be solved. Using that knowledge, you can incorpo- rate elements of her solutions into a revised design where they work  and ﬁt best without compromising the integrity of the creation just so  that people have something to point to and say, “I came up with that.”  Remember, a good idea can come from anywhere.  Step 5: Move forward together Armed with a better understanding of your original proposed design  you should now be able to iterate upon it in a way that strengthens its  alignment with your research, design principles, and so on.   6. CRITIQUING WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE AND CHALLENGING SITUATIONS     165   Of  course,  you  have  the  option  of  ending  your  discussion  by  sitting  down at your desk, making your revisions, and sending your updated  design back out for feedback. But think about it for a second, and make  sure that ending the discussion is the right thing to do at this time.  In most of the situations we’ve seen where this comes up, particularly  when collecting feedback from teammates, stakeholders, or clients  as  opposed to outside individuals , this approach is repeatedly problem- atic because it’s exactly what caused the issue in the ﬁrst place. The  designer or team came up with their proposal and sent it over in an  email  with  a  few  sparse  instructions  on  how  the  client,  stakeholder,  and others should send back their thoughts.  You’ve got some opportunities here.  One possibility is for you to set up some time with the individual s  and  explore some of the changes together. Work together to generate multi- ple possibilities for a change and then reﬁne them collaboratively. This  gives you more insight into their thinking and gives you more opportu- nities to help them understand the design process.  Another thing to think about is how you’ll collect feedback throughout  the rest of the project. Not everything can be done together in real time.  There will be times when you need to put something together and then  get  other  people’s  thoughts  in  order  to  make  changes.  We’ve  always  found  it’s  best  to  collect  feedback  in  person   physically  or  remotely ,  because  then  we’re  able  to  structure  and  facilitate  the  conversation  around critique.  For the situations in which someone proposes a change, we’re imme- diately able to ask her why and get a better understanding of what it is  she’s trying to do. Yes, there are times when schedules are tight and  we can’t talk about everything we need to on our call, but by beginning  the discussion in this way, we ﬁnd that the remaining feedback that is  sent by email is often much more useful than if all we’d done to initi- ate things was send her an email with our design and a request for her  feedback.  If the individual is a member of your project, moving forward, consider  reaching out to her a little earlier in the process. Share design concepts  with her and, if appropriate, ensure that she is invited to team critiques.  Be  transparent  with  your  design  process  and  what  you  are  trying  to  accomplish with your designs. Keep an open dialogue with the person.   166     DISCUSSING DESIGN   Hopefully this will help the individual feel more comfortable commu- nicating about designs with you and lead to more productive conver- sations and less bulleted lists or designs in response to your designs.  Wrapping Up Any time that we are collaborating with others, there are bound to be  communication miscues, conﬂict, and frustration. This is the nature  of working with people.  We are all different with differing personalities, character traits, and  ideas as to how things should work. We should expect that there will be  some level of communication gaps and even conﬂict, but by no means  does this mean that we should enter working relationships looking to  be combative.  Instead, we should be aware of the possible causes for these challenges  and arm ourselves with tactics, a bit of extra patience, and a resolve to  keep things focused on the project and its objectives, even if they begin  to feel personal.  In this chapter, we covered different situations that you might encoun- ter. Here are some of the key takeaways:     Not  all  feedback  is  wanted,  relevant,  or  actionable.  This  is  to  be  expected and we should do our best to salvage what we can from  it, if possible.     When giving feedback to someone who has difﬁculty receiving it,  be considerate, focus your language on the work  not the person   and the iterative aspect of critique, be honest, and balance the con- versation around strengths and weakness.     Facilitating  reactive  or  directive  feedback  relies  heavily  on  a   methodical asking of the question “Why?”   6. CRITIQUING WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE AND CHALLENGING SITUATIONS     167  Central Idea When situations become challenging, try to steer the conversation back to  the main concerns. Engage the person or participants with whom you are  working by keeping the conversation centered on the product.      Ensuring that everyone involved in a group critique has an under- standing of what useful feedback  critique  is and what the focus  of the conversation should be on can go a long way toward keeping  conversations efﬁcient as well as providing tools to refocus them  when they go astray.     If someone has responded to proposed designs by sending her own  versions of the design, take a step back and look at what she sent,  analyze the differences between the proposed design and hers, and  then follow up to discuss it with her.      Use  preestablished  artifacts  such  as  goals,  personas,  scenarios,   and principles to center conversations.     If you know someone is going to be difﬁcult or tends to be difﬁcult   in meetings, communicate with that person ahead of time.  Communication is at the core of critique. When things start to go awry,  the best way to get things back on track is to refocus the conversations  on the objectives. Putting the focus back on the product can get to the  intent of unwanted critique or situations in which someone is being  difﬁcult.  168     DISCUSSING DESIGN
