Contact: richard.carter@peacockcarter.co.uk  Firstly, I'd like to thank David Barnes of Packt for helping to nurture  the idea for this book, and to those behind the scenes at Packt -  particularly Lata - for their help guiding me through their processes.    Michael, my business partner, is owed thanks too, for keeping the  business running during those times I needed to concentrate on the  book, as are Danni, my friends, and my family, all of whom were  supportive throughout  and probably relieved that I had something  to do with my time other than creating websites .    Additional thanks are due to Peter, the reviewer, who had plenty of  useful and interesting suggestions for the book.  [ FM-4 ]   About the Reviewer  Peter De Decker is the author of a MediaWiki extension called IpbWiki which is  an integration plugin that integrates the forum software Invision Power Board with  the Mediawiki engine with the main purpose of giving the applications a unified  look and login. During the ongoing creation of this extension he has become an  expert in understanding the MediaWiki source code and layout.  As Peter had previously reviewed the MediaWiki Administrator book it was only  logical to also use his MediaWiki expertise for this book on MediaWiki skinning.  During his day job Peter works as a Database Adminstrator for SQL Server in a  company called Financial Architects, where he is part of the Core Development  team.  His main task there is to provide a solid product base which the other teams  in the firm can use or expand up on. As a secondary profession, he sells software and  services through his company called Global Soft. When he's not working he likes to  exercise his hobbies: running, biking, collecting comics, and playing snooker.

What This Book Covers Chapter 1 takes a look at existing wikis on the web, and introduces the case study  used throughout the book.  Chapter 2 goes through setting your new skin as the wiki's default skin, and  styling the different views of the wiki's primary content that will be seen by your  wiki's visitors.   Chapter 3 describes how the interface elements such as the navigation links and  search feature can be styled, as well as how to customize the edit toolbar.  Chapter 4 takes a look at the   attributes in MediaWiki, and begins to structure  the case study wiki in to a newer, more suitable layout.  Chapter 5 covers more in-depth PHP and MediaWiki functions you can use to  enhance your new MediaWiki skin.  Chapter 6 describes how to design and create a visual hierarchy for your  wiki's content.  Chapter 7 describes useful JavaScript code and CSS that you can use to enhance your  wiki and its features.  Chapter 8 explains how to integrate your wiki with social networking sites, and how  to use services such as YouTube and Twitter on your MediaWiki.   Preface  Chapter 9 takes a look at deploying your new MediaWiki skin, and the options you  have when licensing your wiki's skin for others to use.  Chapter 10 explains how to style your wiki's content for printing.  In Appendix A, the different modes of interpretation such as Standards mode and  Quirks mode are discussed.  What You Need for This Book Access to a server, either available on your computer locally, or on the web, is useful  to test your skin. Additionally, you will need to have installed MediaWiki, and have  full permissions to edit the ﬁ les associated with it. Other than this, a simple text  editor or any HTML CSS PHP editor with syntax highlighting will be required.  Who is This Book For This book is aimed at web designers or wiki administrators who want to customize  the look of MediaWiki by using custom skins.  You will already have a MediaWiki installation that you are targeting with your skin.  This might be your own installation, or you might be a designer developing a custom  look for a client. The book does not cover setting up or using MediaWiki, except for  features speciﬁ cally related to skinning.  This book assumes that you are familiar with CSS and HTML, but no prior  knowledge of PHP is required.  Conventions In this book, you will ﬁ nd a number of styles of text that distinguish between  different kinds of information.

[ 4 ]   Introduction  For some websites, wikis along with blogs  weblogs  have become an essential  component in order to collaborate in online editing. MediaWiki is one of the most  popular wikis in use, with features such as integration of YouTube videos. It also  has plugins that allow forums such as Invision Power Board  to integrate with  MediaWiki.  By playing around with MediaWiki's PHP template ﬁ les and Cascading Style Sheets   CSS , almost any design can be recreated in MediaWiki. The more complicated the  design is, the more work will be involved in skinning MediaWiki to match it!   In this chapter, we will discuss the following:           The importance of skinning your wiki The MediaWiki skins supplied with the MediaWiki install Some examples of creative MediaWiki skins in action A  case study, which will be the focus of the techniques we discuss  throughout the book.  For the purpose of this book, you should install MediaWiki and complete the basic  conﬁ guration  refer to http:  www.installationwiki.org . Then begin restyling  your wiki. A basic working knowledge of eXtensible Hyper Text Markup Language   XHTML  and Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  is required. An understanding of PHP as  well as MediaWiki  for example, being able to edit pages  will be a bonus.  Examples of MediaWiki Skins  There is little variation in the MediaWiki skins of each wiki, when we take their  popularity into consideration. A few examples of existing wikis will give you an idea  of what can be achieved. In particular, we will look at Wikipedia, which has become  synonymous with wikis, AboutUs, and the WordPress Codex.    Introduction  Wikipedia: The Monotony of MonoBook   Wikipedia, the  "free encyclopedia that everyone can edit", is the most well-known  example of a MediaWiki implementation. Wikipedia uses a slightly modiﬁ ed  version of the "MonoBook" theme, the default MediaWiki skin that is supplied with  the installation.  [ 6 ]   Chapter 1  It is surprising that only a few webmasters redesign their wiki— the 'MonoBook'  theme supplied with MediaWiki's installation and used on Wikipedia, is a very  common sight on wikis. The logo is often the only element that is changed in the  design. The problem with MonoBook is that Wikipedia has become so popular that  the MonoBook theme is usually associated with Wikipedia rather than MediaWiki.  Although a great change in the overall layout of components can cause visitors to  the wiki to become disorientated, a reasonable amount of change can be made before  this occurs, so this should not deter us too much.  MediaWiki comes with a selection of six themes: "Chick", "Classic", "Cologne Blue",  "MonoBook", "Nostalgia", and "Simple". Another theme, "MySkin", allows you to  specify the stylesheet to be used by creating a valid CSS ﬁ le at User:YourUserName  myskin.css in your wiki's namespace. Apart from the "MonoBook" skin, the other  MediaWiki themes are not used very frequently. This is because aesthetically, they  are not very appealing.  A  s an online encyclopedia, Wikipedia's skin is under-stated. A too bright design  would hinder the visitors' focus not only from the web page content, but also the  most important aspects of the website. Let's face it: MonoBook is an ugly skin. It is  grey, dull, and unappealing to new visitors. Wikipedia's saving grace is its content;  but the supposed focus of each page's primarily monochrome content is lost to the  plethora of blue links surrounding the content.  The use of a small font allows a lot of content to be displayed on the screen, and is  ideal for an encyclopedia with long articles. But the amount of content on the screen  makes it hard to read for a long period of time.    There is too much information on the screen, such as links to that versions of the  page in different languages and log in and register links. Because of this, no single  element on the page really stands out. This means the search box is unlikely to be  used unless you are a frequent visitor to Wikipedia, and only those "in the know"  will be aware of the ability to edit pages.  [ 7 ]   Introduction  Bog Standard M ediaWiki's Standard skin is another one that is supplied with the installation.  Not surprisingly, there is nothing special about this skin. It displays the content in a  plain, featureless way, which may be suitable for Wikipedia, but will not help you to  differentiate your wiki from other wikis.  In Standard, the navigation, including the links to the page in different languages  is split between the left-hand column and the top of the screen. This unnecessarily  pushes the page's primary content even further down the page.  [ 8 ]   N ostalgia Nostalgia is similar to MediaWiki's Standard skin. It  is similar to Standard in placing  various  probably infrequently used  links above the page's primary content. Unlike  Standard, the Nostalgia skin aligns the wiki's logo to the right rather than the left,  making it less of a focus on the page.  Chapter 1  The location of the page's primary title makes it very clear as to what the content  of the page is all about  in this case, Conway's Game of Life . It is good for search  engines too, but the content related to this heading is far down the page.  [ 9 ]   Introduction  Many of MediaWiki's characteristic links, such as "Edit this page" and "Discuss this  page" are again included in this skin underneath the primary content.  MediaWiki is generally quite slow in presenting pages to the visitors, and the  duplication of content in the Nostalgia skin does not prove to be helpful.  Mod ern Mode rn is an improvement on these skins: it looks better-designed, and the  muted grays and blues used in the header and navigation help to give the content a  greater focus.  [ 10 ]   Chapter 1  Notice the absence of the Wikipedia logo in this screenshot. Modern does not allow  the space for it, which could present a problem if you want to use your wiki's logo  with this skin.  Although the links are not underlined, the "blue" does suggest that visitors can  interact with them. Also, the article's content is displayed in a clear manner.   However, but attempting to prove useful for every type of wiki you would want to  create, this skin suffers from the same problems as its siblings do. Modern leaves  very little to be desired in terms of distinguishing your wiki from other wikis on  the Internet. As with MonoBook, Modern's search box is in the left-hand column,  meaning it's not instantly recognizable as a search feature, which most users will  expect to be at the top right of their screens.  [ 11 ]   Introduction  Simp le MediaWiki's Simple skin lives up to its name. Again,  the navigation and search  features are located in the left-hand column in this skin. But unlike MonoBook and  Modern, the "View" links are displayed in this column too, rather than at the top of  the page.  This allows content in the Simple skin to be displayed at the full height of the  visitor's browser, which is useful for wikis with long pages of content, such  as Wikipedia.  Unlike MonoBook, Simple's category links are not styled so as to separate them  from the rest of the content. Instead, they are styled in a similar way to the rest of  the page's content, having the same font size but being in blue. This may not be as  beneﬁ cial for the wiki's visitors, as the centrally-aligned text in the categories box is  not as obvious after a long block of left-aligned text. See the following screenshot:  [ 12 ]   Chapter 1  Cologne Blue Cologne  Blue follows a format similar to the other MediaWiki skins but has better  features. The language links are colored green rather than blue, distinguishing them  from the more useful links.   [ 13 ]   Introduction  The skin is another dull blur of blue, gray, and blue-gray colors that are most suited  to general use.   As we will see, it's useful to skin MediaWiki to help distinguish your wiki and make  its useful features stand out.  Customi zed MediaWiki Skins A n easy option to brighten up your wiki is to change the color scheme of MonoBook.  Memory Alpha  http:  www.memory-alpha.org  is a good example of the  MonoBook skin that uses a different color scheme, but the monotony of MonoBook is  still noticeable. However, it does make skinning MediaWiki more rewarding.  Adobe Labs Wiki T   he Adobe Labs wiki  http:  labs.adobe.com wiki   provides information on  upcoming technologies at Adobe.  It allows the developers to evaluate them before  they are fully launched, with information about the application's prerequisite  requirements in both hardware and software.  [ 14 ]   Chapter 1  The article content draws focus to itself due to its white background that contrasts  with the gray color used in the background and in the column on the left. The article,  discussion, view source or edit, and the history links also draw your focus.  In order to edit the articles, visitors must register and log in, as edits by anonymous  editors are disabled. Interestingly, visitors can edit articles' discussion pages without  the need to register, thus helping to preserve the content of the article with minimal  poor quality edits.  T he bright red color of the Adobe logo pulls the focus away from the page's main  content. Also, the wide column on the left-hand side lessens the width of the article  content, thereby diminishing its ability to pull the visitor's eye towards the content.  AboutUs AboutUs  http:  www.aboutus.org  is a wiki whose goal is to maintain up-to-date  information about other websites and topics or information created by the community.  Take a look at the following screenshot:  [ 15 ]       Introduction  The conspicuous, brightly colored edit link is the focus of the page, drawing your  attention to the content on the page. Its "make constructive edits anywhere you see  ﬁ t" encourages short but constructive edits to be made to the articles. While Wikipedia's more subdued skin buries the edit link in the page, AboutUs  uses color and the positioning of the edit feature on the top left to make it incredibly  obvious that you can edit the content yourself. Wikipedia may be happy to allow  only the more seasoned wiki users to edit content, but as an emerging website,  AboutUs actively encourages its visitors to contribute to it. A more careful look at AboutUs reveals the absence of the discussion pages seen  on Wikipedia and other wikis. This lessens the number of links required on each  page that are not directly related to the page's content, thereby allowing AboutUs to  appear simpler than Wikipedia. The Find feature presents itself as an "obstacle" to the visitors, thus inviting them  to search for the content that they are looking for. The advertising in the right-hand  column does not detract from the page's content, and the complementary colors that  are used help to make the adverts appear as if they are organic content, rather than a  way to generate income for the website. A  nother innovation of the AboutUs wiki is that it creates the basis of an article  on your behalf by locating the domain name's title, and a description extracted from  the website.  The WordPress Codex Wor dPress  http:  www.wordpress.org , the blog platform, uses MediaWiki to  store its documentation in the WordPress Codex  http:  codex.wordpress.org .  [ 16 ]   Chapter 1  The Codex MediaWiki skin is a vast improvement on MonoBook. The  WordPress logo is very attractive. Using a gray header and white text, the logo  draws the visitors' attention. The  neutral blue background color for the "sectional" heading "Codex", and the  log in and register links towards the right, orientate the visitor to the Codex. These  elements help in determining the section of the WordPress website in which we  are currently working. They also determine the visitor's ability to log in and even  access some other features. The highlighted Docs tab in the navigation also helps to  orientate the user.  Although the links are not underlined, the blue color indicates that the visitors can  click on them. The headings within the page are well-spaced so as to indicate their  importance within the page.  [ 17 ]   Introduction  Why Skin Your  Media  Wiki? Ther  e are many reasons to skin your MediaWiki wiki. Some of them are as follows:              Distinguishing your wiki's look and feel through your own choice of colors,  images, and fonts. Integrating the wiki with the rest of your website. This can include adding  navigation to other areas of your website, or simply copying the design of  your main website. Usability means if your wiki exists for a particular purpose, a custom skin  can emphasize the features that are important for the users. Adding widgets such as advertisements, social media buttons, and other  external content, and removing some features of MediaWiki.  We will take a closer look at each of these before moving on to look at our case study.  Distinguishing Your Wiki Skin ning your wiki allows you to distinguish your website from the other websites  by using one of the skins supplied with the installation. If your wiki is aimed at a  niche usergroup, skinning your wiki can indicate the information in your wiki to the  visitors. For example, if your wiki is about tea bags of the nineteenth century, a design  that subtly suggests the visitors that the website is about tea bags of the 1800s would  prove to be a good idea. In contrast, if you are aiming to create the next Wikipedia,  using a skin that features scenes of the French Revolution may not be such a great  idea. The skinning of AboutUs does exactly that. It differentiates the wiki from the  MonoBook clones that populate the Internet so densely.  Integrating it With Your Website You  can skin your wiki so that it matches the rest of your website. This would prove  to be important in business websites that utilize wikis. The reason for this is that  reinforcing your brand, including your company logo, name, and color scheme  can help the customers in remembering your company. This can aid in providing a  smooth transition from where a visitor starts viewing your website to where they  obtain the information that they were looking for in your website.  The WordPress Codex is a good example of integrating a wiki into an existing  website design.  [ 18 ]   Chapter 1  Improving Your Wiki's Usability A re designed wiki can place relevant elements in better positions. When you want to  encourage a lot of people to edit your wiki, making the edit link the focus of the page  will be helpful. When you want to encourage people to discuss articles on your wiki,  a more prominent discussion link will be helpful. If your wiki articles are short, you  will need to add more content in order to make it more readable for the visitors.  Adding and Removing Widgets and Features Alte    ring your wiki's design is a good idea if you want to incorporate more features  such as social-bookmarking links so that the visitors can add pages to Digg,  Facebook, and Technorati. Skinning MediaWiki will also allow you to remove  features such as the discussion page on "AboutUs". Advertising is another feature of  'AboutUs'. It can be added to your wiki so as to help you generate revenue to pay for  hosting your wiki.  Our Case Study: JazzMeet To p rovide a consistent example throughout this book, we will be skinning  MediaWiki for JazzMeet, a wiki used to organise jazz festivals in the same way as  BarCamp  http:  www.barcamp.org  organises meetings to share knowledge.  JazzMeet helps in organizing jazz music festivals in various cities across the world,  and provides information on the bands and artists performing at each venue, as well  as the time and place of every event. Take a look at the following screenshot:  [ 19 ]   Introduction  [ 20 ]   Chapter 1    The most noticeable thing about the AboutUs MediaWiki skin is that it doesn't really  look like a wiki. The colors create a more welcoming atmosphere than MonoBook's,  and whilst there are advertisements, they're generally restricted to the outer  columns, well away from the primary content.   The advertisements underneath the page's title are more subtle than the other  adverts, adopting the color scheme of the content. The log in and registration links  are not as much of a focus, being at the right hand side of the screen, but are still  large enough to attract visitors' attention.  A more careful look at AboutUs reveals the absence of the discussion pages seen on  Wikipedia and other wikis. This lessens the number of links required on each page  that aren't directly related to the page's content, allowing AboutUs to appear simpler  than Wikipedia, in turn appearing more inviting to wiki novices.  The search feature presents itself as an 'obstacle' to visitors, inviting them to search  for the content they're looking for, and the advertising in the right-hand column  doesn't detract from the page's content, but the complementary colors used help to  make them feel as if they were organic content, rather than a way to generate income  for the website.  Another innovation of the AboutUs wiki - which sadly can't be achieved with  skinning - is that following a link to an article which does not exist creates the basis  of an article on your behalf, locating the domain name's title, and a description  extracted from the website.  The Process of Skinning MediaWiki Skinn ing MediaWiki can be a difﬁ cult task, but  having a way of changing your  wiki's appearance methodically can simplify it. The purpose of and the audience  for your wiki need to be considered when designing your wiki so as to make it  appealing to your audience and to include various desirable features.  Your Wiki's Purpose Consi der the purpose of wiki. For example, will it need a "talk-page" feature, or can  we remove this and thereby simplify the wiki's interface for the visitors? Does your  wiki really need links to other versions of that page in different languages? It is  unlikely if you are just starting your wiki that additional language versions exist. If  required, this feature can always be put back at a later date.  [ 21 ]   Introduction  If your wiki is primarily for images, a wider content area might be useful to allow  the images to be shown in a larger format. If your wiki's content is likely to be  text-based, then you need to make the wiki's text easy to read. If your wiki has less  text, then you can make the text larger so as to make it easier to read and more  prominent on the page.  Try to ﬁ gure out whether you want your wiki to share documentation, create an  encyclopedia, or organize meetings or festivals. Then add  or remove  features from  MediaWiki in order to meet the purpose.  Your Wiki's Audience Your  wiki's audience will determine its features to some extent. For example, people  in their ﬁ fties will probably be less likely to use Digg or Delicious. As a result, adding  links for these will be unnecessary in a wiki that is aimed at that age group. If your  target audience is an age group that is below ﬁ fty, they are more likely to use social  bookmarking, so these links may be worth adding.  It is simplest to start with altering the look of your wiki, rather than the layout, and  then moving on to add some extra features.  Summary Wikis are very useful for version management in documents and to share various  ideas and information. In recent years, they have grown considerably in use and  visibility on the Internet, especially Wikipedia and its sister projects. While the skins  that come with the MediaWiki installation are functional, they do not seem to be  attractive.  Skinning MediaWiki will also allow you to add and remove features, and style your  wiki to match the remainder of your website. This will make it easier to use, and  distinguish your wiki from the monotony of MonoBook.  You might have a good idea of what your wiki needs to communicate to your  visitors. You also need to consider your wiki's intended audience and purpose.  Along with it, you also need to have an idea about the appearance of your wiki.   [ 22 ]   Formatting the Body  In this chapter, we will see how to change the appearance of your wiki. This includes  the various content areas of MediaWiki such as the article pages, the edit interface,  and the preview interface.  In this chapter, we will cover the following:  Adding a new skin in MediaWiki, with guidance on setting your new  skin as:                     the wiki's default skin your default skin Styling the article content Styling the edit interface Styling the preview interface Styling the "show changes" interface Styling the "log in" and "register" interfaces  Initializing Your Skin  In order to view changes that have made to your skin's design, you need to make a  few changes to MediaWiki. We need to inform MediaWiki that we want to view the  wiki's content using a different skin from the default, that is, MonoBook.  CSS and Image Files You will need to create a new directory in the skins directory, such as skins  yourskinname , within your MediaWiki installation directory, where yourskinname  is the name of your new MediaWiki skin.   Formatting the Body   To keep things simple, we will call our new skin jazzmeet, and store it in the  skins jazzmeet  directory. The primary Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  ﬁ le for  each skin is usually in this skin directory and is known as main.css. But it can be  changed in the header of your skin's PHP template. For example, the CSS ﬁ le for  our new skin should be located at skins jazzmeet main.css within our wiki's  installation directory .   You may ﬁ nd it useful to copy an existing skin directory, such as  MonoBook  from skins monobook  , and rename it for using it as your  new skin's directory  for example, skins yourskinname  .  shared.css in skins common  contains styles that are used by all of the skins. We  can easily ignore this, as we can overwrite any unwanted style in main.css.  PHP Template   We need to carry out the following steps before we can start skinning MediaWiki:  1.  Create a PHP ﬁ le named YourSkinName.php. in the skins  directory. 2.  Open this ﬁ le and edit the line that reads- class SkinMonoBook extends  SkinTemplate to read class YourSkinName extends SkinTemplate, but  replace YourSkinName with the name of your new skin.  3.  Find the line that reads class MonoBookTemplate extends   QuickTemplate; to read class YourSkinNameTemplate extends  QuickTemplate; Again, replace YourSkinName with the name of your  new skin.  4.  Finally, you need to inform MediaWiki about your skin by inserting the   following into the ﬁ le:  $this->skinname  = 'yourskinname'; $this->stylename = 'yourskinname';  $this->template  = 'YourSkinNameTemplate';  The convention in MediaWiki is to name your skin using CamelCase, for  example, MonoBook and JazzMeet rather than Monobook and jazzmeet.  Be sure to replace your skin name with the directory's name  for example, $this- >skinname = 'jazzmeet' , and YourSkinName with the name of your new skin as it  is in the PHP ﬁ lename.  Be careful with variable and directory naming as they are case-sensitive.  [ 24 ]   Using Your Skin   There are two ways to view your skin: setting it as the default skin for the wiki, and  changing your user account preferences, which means that only you will see the skin  by default when you are logged in. The latter option means that you will be required  to register an account on your wiki after creating an '"admin" or "sysop" account  when MediaWiki is installed.  Chapter 2  Making Your Skin as Wiki's Default Skin  To make your new skin the default skin for all visitors to your wiki, set the  $wgDefaultSkin variable in LocalSettings.php ﬁ le to the name of your skin.  For example, replace $wgDefaultSkin = 'monobook' with $wgDefaultSkin =  'jazzmeet'. Save the ﬁ le and upload it in its original directory.  In some versions of MediaWiki, $wgDefaultskin may not be in your  LocalSettings.php ﬁ le. You need to add it if you are not able to  see it.  Making Your Skin as Your Default Skin  Log in to your wiki, and select the my preferences option from the user bar   positioned at the top-right of the screen in MonoBook . Select the Skins tab and you  will ﬁ nd your new skin is in the list of skins that are available on your wiki.  [ 25 ]   Formatting the Body  Select the option button that is next to your skin's name, and click the Save button at  the bottom of the page in order to set the skin as the default each time you log in.   If you do not have JavaScript enabled, the options in your user account  preferences section will be scrambled and will appear as one long page.   Styling Article Content   Now that we can see our new skin, we can start altering its look and feel. If you have  copied another skin directory, delete the CSS and image ﬁ les in the new  copied   directory, so that you are not working with the other CSS that you copied which  would undoubtedly result in a bulky and unnecessary CSS. The Content Body    By default, the content for each page is contained in a div with id content, and  then CSS rules are applied to content. content does not contain the page's  content  this is in bodyContent, which is nested in content , but it contains  .firstHeading, a   tag that holds the page's title.  If your MediaWiki skin does not follow the naming conventions that are  used in the default skins such as MonoBook, you can style your wiki's  elements with the help of their references.  There are many elements within bodyContent, each of which has a speciﬁ c purpose  in MediaWiki. Obviously, you can name the elements in your MediaWiki skin as  you like, but it would be easier to  follow the original naming conventions if you are  planning to release the skin for use by other developers. Category Links .catlinks identiﬁ es the container for the different categories in the wiki  page. This is similar to Wikipedia's page on Jazz  http:  en.wikipedia.org  wiki Jazz . Refer to the following screenshot:     editsection: page editing options .   editsection distinguishes the "edit" links that are provided against each of the  headings in the editable section of the wiki's pages. The following screenshot shows  the edit option for the section to the right of the heading:  [ 26 ]   Chapter 2  SiteSub: Your Wiki's Claim to Fame   siteSub is used in articles to indicate where the content is from  in a   tag .  By default, it reads "From YourWikiName". As with jump-to-nav, siteSub is  invisible by default in MonoBook.  toc: Table of Contents   toc contains the table of contents. By default, the table of contents appears only  when four or more headings exist within the content. toc-level1 to toclevel6  indicate the hierarchy of the table of contents. A similar example can be viewed at  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Jazz.   [ 27 ]   Formatting the Body  Removing the table of contents: You can remove the table of contents from MediaWiki pages by inserting  the wiki markup __NOTOC__ into the page's editable content.  Wikitable: Tabular Data   wikitable is the default table styling in MediaWiki.  Other elements of interest   jump-to-nav contains links to enable the visitors to skip to other areas of interest  within the current page. In MonoBook, these are hidden with display: none that  displays the links when a "user agent"  that is, the browser  does not allow styling  with CSS.    contentSub is used primarily on pages that are redirected to elsewhere on your  wiki. They should be left visible as deleting them would make it incredibly difﬁ cult  to remove a redirect.  Images    When an image is inserted into a wiki page in MediaWiki, the image automatically  links to its own uploaded image page. .image classiﬁ es the images that are linked to  the wiki's content, rather than the images themselves. Thumbnailed Images  .   thumb, .tright, and .tleft classify images that are thumbnails  created in  wiki syntax [[Image:ImagePath.pngthumbImage caption]] . This  by  default  creates an image of 180 pixels wide with the use of inline CSS  CSS  that is not in a separate ﬁ le, but is embedded in the  x  HTML code .   Making Our Case Study 'JazzMeet'  To start altering the look of the JazzMeet wiki, we will begin by altering the style  within content. To make our lives easier, the following colors  in hexadecimal  notation  from the JazzMeet concept can be used.  Dark brown, 38230C, is used to accentuate the "Meet" in "JazzMeet". Deep red, 8E1425, is used in the "register" bar. Pale beige, E6E4D8, is used as the background color for the primary content  of each page.            [ 28 ]                              Mid-tone beige, D9D5C3, is used as the background color for the right-hand  column, which contains the sponsors and advertisements. Darker beige or brown, BEB798, is used in image borders and for some    level headings.  Chapter 2  Content  Filling your wiki page with adequate content is a better way to check whether every  element is taken into account when they are being styled. In the process, it is useful  to include the following elements:   Any one of these headings  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and   is  preferable, although a   tag is used for the page's title and is assigned the  class .firstHeading. Images, both without styling and as thumbnails, can be used. A table of contents, which is automatically generated when you have four or  more headings in a page. Text: Be sure to include enough text to ﬂ ow over several lines, especially the  text that is bold and italic.  Lists: Both unordered and ordered Links:  In text,         A link to a page internal to the wiki which exists A link to a page internal to the wiki which does not exist A link to an external website  A table of data A category  or more  assigned to the wiki page  created by adding  [[Category:Category_Name]] to the page in edit mode   For JazzMeet, a wiki markup is used to create content for the page. You may be more  comfortable in creating some dummy content that goes with the theme of your wiki.     '''JazzMeet Durham''' is a community-organised jazz festival in the  city of Durham, England.

[[Category:JazzMeetEngland]]    [ 30 ]   Chapter 2  Enabling image uploads: In order to enable image uploads in your MediaWiki installation, set  the value of $wgEnableUploads to true. That is, $wgEnableUploads  = true.  The Content Block: content   We will have to apply CSS to content div in order to style the content body so  as to match our proposed design. At the same time, we will restyle the links in the  content area to match our color scheme. We will make the visited links dark beige,  links that are hovered over as brown, and the non-underlined, and any other link as  red and underlined. The paragraphs in the main content area are given larger text,  and more leading  line-height  to make the content easier to read.  content { background: E6E4D8 url "content_bg.gif"  repeat-y top left; color: 000000; font-family: georgia, "times new roman", times, serif; padding: 10px 5px 10px 35px; width: auto; } content p, content ul, content ol { font-size: 100%; line-height: 175%; } content strong, content b { color: 8C1425 !important;  } content a, content a:active, content a:link { color: 8C1425; font-weight: bold; } content a:visited { color: 857F61; } a.text { border-color: 8C1425; color: 8C1425;  } content a:hover, a:hover.text { color: 38230C !important; text-decoration: none !important; }  [ 31 ]   Formatting the Body  siteSub, the   heading, informs the visitors where the content is from  for  example, "From JazzMeet" . This is hidden and is a repetition of some other content  on the page. For the same reason, jump-to-nav is also hidden. Although this it  is useful for visitors using screen readers, it is a nuisance to those using modern  browsers.  siteSub, jump-to-nav { display: none; }    MediaWiki differentiates between links of various types by applying classes to them.  a.new classiﬁ es links that lead to another page on the wiki, but that page has not yet  been created. p-personal contains user links to their talk page, preferences, and the  register and log page, which will be discussed later.  a.new, p-personal a.new { background: transparent url "a.new.gif"  no-repeat top left; text-decoration: underline; padding-left: 20px; } a.new:visited, p-personal a.new:visited { color: 8C1425 !important; } .text, .external { color: 38230C; }  .external is used to refer to hyperlinks that go beyond the wiki's namespace  for  example, the links created by wiki markup in the following syntax:[http:  www. example.com  example.com] .  For an external text link, the XHTML generated is as follows:  <a href="http:  www.example.com" class="external text"  title="http:  www.example.com" rel="nofollow">example.com   Thus, the .text class classiﬁ es text links. Because MediaWiki does not allow external  links on images, text is used to identify only external text links.  Browser Quirks To overcome some browser quirks, you have to make use of browser- speciﬁ c stylesheets. Some of the problems are addressed in MonoBook's  CSS ﬁ xes, so you can copy the ﬁ les IE50Fixes.css, IE55Fixes.css,  IE60Fixes.css, and IEMacFixes.css from skins monobook  to  your new skin's directory.  [ 32 ]   Chapter 2  Headings: .mw-headline, .firstHeading  .firstHeading is applied to the   tag, which contains the page's main title.  Other headings within the bodyContent div are classiﬁ ed by the .mw-headline  class. The "edit" link is denoted by the .editsection class.  In the case study's design, the page title is displayed in a deep red color  8D1425   in the typeface "Georgia". We can replace any CSS in the main.css ﬁ le regarding  .firstHeading with the following:   h1, .firstHeading { background: transparent url "firstHeading.gif"  center left no-repeat; border-width: 0; color: 8D1425; font-size: 2.2em !important; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: .1em; margin-left: -35px; padding-left: 35px; }  Once you have uploaded your new CSS ﬁ le, refresh your page. The main page  heading will now appear in red and, if it is not speciﬁ ed, the font of the content area  will now be changed to your browser's default "serif" font. In the design for JazzMeet,   headings appear in brown color, while other  headings appear in dark beige along with smaller text for the headings further down  the hierarchy.  content h2, content h3, content h4, content h5, content h6 { border-width: 0; } h3 .mw-headline, h4 .mw-headline, h5 .mw-headline, h6 .mw-headline { color: 857F61; } h2 .mw-headline { color: 38230C; font-size: 120% !important; font-weight: bold; } h3 .mw-headline { font-size: 120%; } h4 .mw-headline { font-size: 115%; }  [ 33 ]   Formatting the Body  h5 .mw-headline, h6 .mw-headline { font-size: 110%; } h6 .mw-headline { text-transform: uppercase; }   Finally, we can change the color of the "edit" link that appears alongside each  sectional heading, by applying style to the .editsection class.  .editsection { color: BEB798 !important; } .editsection a, .editsection a:active, .editsection a:link,  .editsection a:visited { color: BEB798 !important; text-transform: uppercase; }  You can render the "edit" link invisible by using display: none. However, this will  not stop the visitors from editing your pages if they alter the wiki page's URL from  index.php?title= Page_Name to index.php?title=Page_Name&action=edit.  Table Of Contents: toc, .toc  The table of contents is deﬁ ned with toc. It contains an unordered list     with  links to anchors in the page. Each point in the table of contents is deﬁ ned in a list  item     tag, and the elements in the list item are separated with   tags.        Contents        1<  span>  Heading       <span  class="tocnumber">1.1   Sub-heading<  span>         <span  class="tocnumber">2   Another heading<  span>     <span  class="tocnumber">3   Another heading<  span>    [ 34 ]   Chapter 2           .toc and toc apply to the table that surrounds the table of contents. The class  applied to the list item itself, .toclevel-x, changes depending on where the  heading is placed in the table of contents. Here, 'x' is a number that represents the  level of the heading  from 1 to 6 . .tocnumber classiﬁ es the number of the headings  in the table of contents, and .toctext spans the actual text of the heading. .toctitle deﬁ nes the div that contains the heading for the table of contents   "Contents" , a   tag. We will align it to the left, so that the toggle link for  showing and hiding the table of contents can be ﬂ oated to the right by deﬁ ning a  style for .toctoggle. In order to match the new skin's color scheme, we will alter the  colors of the links, and ensure that the future styling of the table does not affect the  table of contents by resetting the border-width attribute to null.    toc, .toc { border: 1px solid BEB798 !important; background: D9D5C3 !important; font-size: 75% !important; margin: 0 10px 10px 0 !important;  padding: 5px !important; } toc h2, .toc h2 { border-width: 0; color: 8D1425; display: inline; padding: 0; font-size: 110%; font-weight: bold; }  .toc td, .toc th, toc td, toc th {  * prevents inheritance of  default content table styling *  border-width: 0 !important; } toc toctitle, .toc toctitle, toc .toctitle, .toc .toctitle { text-align: left; } toc ul, .toc ul { list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;  [ 35 ]   Formatting the Body  text-align: left; } toc ul ul, .toc ul ul { margin: 0 0 0 5px; } toc toctitle, .toc toctitle, toc .toctitle, .toc .toctitle { text-align: left; } toc .toctoggle, .toc .toctoggle { display: inline; font-size: 90% !important; float: right; text-transform: uppercase; } toc a, toc a:active, toc a:link, toc a:visited { color: 8D1425; }  Another option for the table of contents is to render it invisible through the use of  .toc, toc {display: none}.   Beware that pages containing __TOC__  to force the page to show a table  of contents , will not show a table of contents if you do this.   Categories  MediaWiki allows pages to be assigned to one or more "categories", much like  bloggers can "tag" their articles with different keywords. .catlinks classiﬁ es this  content, which only appears on a page when a page has been assigned to one or more  categories. This can be done by adding [[Category:CategoryName]] to the page. In order to match the case study's color scheme, we can restyle the category links  div to a darker beige color and using a border to make it distinct from the remainder  of the content area. The text is made slightly smaller, as it is not likely to be prime  content for most of our visitors.  catlinks { border: 1px solid BEB798; background: D9D5C3; font-size: 85%; padding: 5px; margin: 10px 5px; clear: both; }  The link colors for the "category" block will be inherited from the ones that are  speciﬁ ed for the links in content.   [ 36 ]   Chapter 2  Images  There are two methods for inserting images into a wiki page with wiki markup.  Firstly, only [[Image:ImageName.jpgImage description]] can be used. This  inserts the image in to the page and assigns it to the .image class. Secondly, the  [[Image:ImageName.jpgthumbImage description]] or [[Image:ImageName. jpgthumbleftImage description]] syntax can be used to insert the image  ImageName.jpg.  The images in the JazzMeet concept are ﬂ oated, but this is achieved by using inline  CSS in the wiki page. If you attempt to ﬂ oat images in content or bodyContent,  you will realize that it causes difﬁ culties on other pages, including the redirect pages.  However, we will still give a beige-colored border to the images..  .image img { border: 5px BEB798 solid; margin: 10px; max-width: 500px; } .thumb .image { border-width: 0; }  This gives the maximum width to an image which prevents the image from covering  other content  such as the right-hand column  if an over-sized image is uploaded  and added to a page. It also removes the border from the image thumbnail, since we  want thumbnails to appear different to normal images.  Thumbnail Images   The thumbnail XHTML is reasonably complex. It has the capacity to hold the caption  for the image, as well as an icon that links to the full-size version of the image. By default, thumbnail images ﬂ oat to the right  inherited from the .tright class ,  but the position of the image on the page can be overridden by the user with the  syntax [[Image:ImageName.jpgthumbleftImage description]]. This replaces  the .tright class with the .tleft class. Refer to the following code:  .tright { clear: right; float: right; margin: 5px 0 5px 10px;  } .tleft { clear: left; float: left; margin: 5px 10px 5px 0;  }  [ 37 ]   Formatting the Body    For the JazzMeet wiki, thumbnails need to be restyled in order to coordinate them  with the rest of the content.  .thumb { background: D9D5C3; border: 1px BEB798 solid; padding: 5px; width: auto;  } .thumb .image img { border: 1px BEB798 solid; width: 140px; } .thumbcaption { font-size: 80% !important; font-style: italic; padding: 0 5px !important; }  .magnify { float: left; width: auto; } .magnify img { float: left; width: auto; }  We can also change the styling of the "magnify" image that links to the larger image,  by altering both .magnify and .magnify img.  You can change the "magnify" image to match your skin's theme by replacing  or  creating  a ﬁ le called magnify-clip.png in the skins common images  directory.  Browsers such as Internet Explorer and Firefox need to be told that the image should  not be displayed with a border around it.  .magnify img, .magnify img a { border-width: 0 !important; }  [ 38 ]   This styles the thumbnails in a manner similar to the one in MonoBook, but in  the JazzMeet color scheme, as shown in the following screenshot. Note that the  "magnify" icon in the bottom right of the thumbnail has not been altered:     Chapter 2  Tables  At this point, the tables on your test wiki page are likely to be styled with your  browser's default styling. We can coordinate the styling of the tables in the content  area with the remainder of the page's content. Refer to the following code:  content table { background: transparent; border-width: 0;  } content th, content td { padding: 5px;  } content th { background: BEB798; border-width: 0; color: FFFFFF; font-weight: bold; } content td { border: 1px BEB798 solid; } content caption { display: none; }  This gives a very simple default style for the tables. Wiki markup allows users to  restyle tables to some extent.   [ 39 ]   Formatting the Body  Talk Pages A few changes need to be made so as to alter the talk page and message notiﬁ cations  that appear at the top of wiki pages when a user is logged in and receives a new  message on their talk page.   New Message Notification: .usermessage   .usermessage classiﬁ es the div that appears when a new message is received on a  user's talk page.  .usermessage { background: D9D5C3 url "usermessage.gif"  top left no-repeat; border: 2px 8D1425 solid; color: black; font-weight: bold; margin: 2em 0 1em; padding: 15px 5px 15px 60px; vertical-align: middle; }  After uploading the CSS and placing a suitable image, errormessage.gif in the skin  folder, a message box is produced on your talk page as seen in the following image:  Redirect Pages   Redirect pages are partially styled through the application of the CSS previously  mentioned, but you can address the content of redirect pages on MediaWiki with the  use of the .redirectText class. The only text that appears on redirect pages is the  name of the page, so we'll make the text easier to read by enlarging it.   .redirectText { font-size: 175%; }  [ 40 ]   Chapter 2  You can specify an image to display beside the name of the page. This can be done  either by creating an image or by replacing the image in the skins common images   directory named redirectltr.png.  For the sake of consistency, you could replace  redirectrtl.png too .   Image Detail Pages   An image detail page displays a full-size image in an article. Most of our work in  styling this page will be already done if content has been styled. filetoc, an  unordered list, contains the table of contents for the uploaded media pages. It can  also be altered so as to match the rest of the wiki. Refer to the following code:  ulfiletoc { border: 1px solid aaaaaa; background: D9D5C3; border: 1px BEB798 solid; font-size: 90%; margin: 10px; padding: 5px; } filetoc li { display: inline; list-style-type: none; margin: 5px; } h2filelinks { color: 857F61; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; }  h2filelinks { color: 857F61; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase;    }  [ 41 ]  Some pages in the wiki that make use of the image are listed, and this header can be  styled by applying CSS to h2filelinks.   Formatting the Body  Empty Articles   A message appears when you visit a non-existent URL within the wiki's namespace,  by typing the page's address manually into your browser's address bar. This message  does not appear if you follow a link to an article that does not exist. In that case, you  are redirected to the edit interface to begin creating the page. This message can be styled using div.noarticletext. If the message appears on  the screen, it means that not much text is on the page. We can therefore make the  message more prominent by enlarging the text.  .noarticletext { font-size: 150%;  }  Search Results   As search results are paginated, you can style the elements that appear in the  search results page  Special:Search  by addressing them directly, and by  making use of the unique class name assigned to each page's   tag in the  wiki .page-Special_Search.  Recent Changes   Similarly, the recent changes page  Special:Recentchanges  needs no alteration to  ﬁ nish skinning it, but can be styled by reference to .page-Special_Recentchanges.  Styling the Edit Interface  The edit interface appears when you select the "edit" option at the top of the page.  It allows visitors to edit the page's content in your wiki by using a mixture of wiki  markup and inline CSS. Now that the article interface has been styled, little needs to  be styled to alter the appearance of the edit interface.  The Basics  The edit interface is contained within a  , which can be styled to differentiate it  from the general content.  content form { background: D9D5C3; border: 1px solid BEB798; margin: 3px 0; padding: 10px 5px;  }  [ 42 ]   Chapter 2  There are a number of elements contained within the edit interface form. These are  as follows:                  wpSummary is the text box that is used to describe the nature of the edit  made by the wiki's visitor. wpMinorEdit is a check-box that indicates whether the associated edit to  the page was "minor"  that is, small changes . pWatchthis is another check  box that allows a user to specify whether the page is to be listed in their  "watchlist". The watchlist feature is only available to the users who are  registered and logged in. wpSave is a submit button that saves the changes the user has made to the  page, so that other users of the wiki can view your changes with immediate  effect. wpPreview is a button that allows the user to preview your page.  MediaWiki generates a version of the page as it would appear if the changes  were saved, but does not actually save the changes. Finally, wpDiff is a button that allows the user to see the difference between  the last version of the page and the changes that they have made.   It is better not to deﬁ ne the width and the height for the    wpTextbox1   used to edit the wiki, because the columns and rows are deﬁ ned in XHTML. There  are still some small changes that can be made to help style the text area in order to  match your skin, such as altering the borders and changing the background colors.  One of the most useful aspects of skinning MediaWiki is the ability to use  proportional font sizes in the text area. This would be of a great help to those with  disabilities, especially visually impaired persons, as it makes the editing of the  content easier.  wpTextbox1 { font-family: georgia, "times new roman", times, sans-serif; font-size: 100%; }   The background and borders are deﬁ ned together with the style for the other  elements in the form, so as to minimize the CSS ﬁ le size. The text boxes and check  boxes still need styling, as do the background color and border of the text area.  wpTextbox1, wpSummary, wpMinoredit, wpWatchthis { background: E6E4D8; border: 1px solid BEB798; margin: 5px 0; }  [ 43 ]   The buttons at the bottom of the form are contained within .editbuttons for ease of  movement, and they appear a little close to the other elements in the form. Now, we  will add some space above and below them.  Formatting the Body  .editbuttons { margin: 10px 0;  }  The "Save", "Preview", and "Diff"  difference  buttons contained within  .editbuttons can now be styled to match the remaining elements in the form.  wpSave, wpDiff { font-weight: normal; } wpSave, wpDiff { background: E6E4D8; border: 2px solid BEB798; color: 38230C;  * brown *  padding: 3px 5px; } wpPreview { background: 8D1425; border: 2px FFFFFF solid; color: FFFFFF; font-weight: bold; padding: 3px 5px;  }  .editHelp { display: block; font-size: 75%; margin: 5px 0;  }   The 'Preview' button appears in red in order to encourage JazzMeet's visitors to  preview their page before saving it, and thereby reduce the number of useless edits  being made to the wiki. To help accentuate the "preview" button, we can move the  "cancel" and "editing help" links beneath the .editbuttons div.  The "edit" interface will now look similar to the following image:  [ 44 ]   Chapter 2  Toolbar  You may want to limit what you change in the toolbar, as many of your visitors  will already be familiar with the toolbar-based text editor on the web. You may be  expecting something similar to be displayed on your website as well. Similar to the  rest of MediaWiki's markup, the "edit" interface's toolbar has a unique identifying  value  toolbar .  If you want to alter the toolbar's images, you can replace the images preﬁ xed with  button_ in skins common images .   Before replacing the toolbar button images, remember to create a copy of  them elsewhere, in case you want to restore them at a later stage.  Legal Notices and Warnings   editpage-copywarn contains a warning that is displayed on the edit interface's  page, thereby notifying the users that the content they submit to the wiki may  be "edited mercilessly", and a reminder not to submit the copyrighted work. For  JazzMeet, we will decrease the size of the text to help retain a friendly atmosphere  for visitors.  editpage-copywarn { color: 202020; font-size: 75%; }  Preview Page  The "Preview" page acts as an interpretation of what the page you are currently  editing would look like if you were to save it. The preview is placed above the edit  interface so that you can make changes to the article after previewing it.  As the styling has done most of the work for us, there are only two elements of  the preview page that still need to be covered. They are: previewnote, a reminder  that any changes made to the page have not been saved, and wikiPreview, the  containing div for the preview.  [ 45 ]   Formatting the Body  Knowing how forgetful people can be, we can style this section to be more  distinguished than it is in MonoBook, with a deep red border with a width of 2  pixels. We will also set the message that reminds us that we are only viewing the  preview a little larger than other text.  wikiPreview { border: 2px 8D1425 solid !important; padding: 0; } .previewnote { color: 8D1425; font-size: 150%; }  The preview page will now appear a bit different from the normal page view, which  will hopefully prevent any cases of edits being lost because the visitors thought they  had submitted their edits rather than just previewed them.    The edit page's template includes wikiPreview by default, so any  ambitious styling may affect the appearance of your edit page and  preview page.  [ 46 ]   Chapter 2  Show Differences  If you select the "Show Changes" option from the edit interface, you will see two  columns: one that contains the last version of the page's content, and one that shows  the version of the content  which has not yet been saved .  When displayed in the JazzMeet skin, the "show changes" view is displayed in two  table columns alongside each other. Areas of changed content are highlighted in  yellow cells in the left-hand column. Content that has been added is highlighted red,  with the relevant portion of content being highlighted with a green background.  [ 47 ]   Formatting the Body  .diff-otitle is used to identify the table cell that contains the heading for the  current version of the page, as saved in the wiki's database. Similarly, .diff-ntitle  identiﬁ es the table cell that contains the heading for the version of the page's content  in the edit box. To highlight these cells, we will make them bold, and change  their colors.  .diff-otitle, .diff-ntitle { background: BEB798 !important; color: FFFFFF; font-weight: bold; }  td.diff-lineno { color: BEB798; }   The cells     that indicate the lines of the content's wiki markup are identiﬁ ed by  .diff-lineno.  .diff-context classiﬁ es the cells containing the content that surrounds the changed  areas in them. .diff-marker identiﬁ es cells that give hints to the visitor about the  content, including the cells containing a "+" or "-" to indicate whether content has  been added or removed from that area. The cells containing line numbers  .diff- lineno  can also be styled by applying CSS. Because these cells are not as important  as the content being changed in this table, we will give them a beige background.   .diff-context, .diff-marker { background: D9D5C3 !important; }  .diff-deletedline classiﬁ es the table cells that contain a line that is present in the  current page, but is now being deleted by the user. .diff-addedline, originally,  classiﬁ es the content that has been inserted compared to the current version.  Lastly, .diffchange identiﬁ es the area of the text that has been added to the current  version. It looks ﬁ ne in its default red, but we will style it to become our 'JazzMeet'  beige instead.  .diffchange { color: BEB798 !important; }  [ 48 ]   Although these changes have only styled a small portion of the wiki, they will  help to integrate the skin fully across the wiki. If the elements are not styled as  consistently as they were in MonoBook, we will have a very poor skin.  Chapter 2  [ 49 ]   Formatting the Body  Logging In and Registering   The login and registration pages are mostly styled by this stage, but you may want to  tidy them up a bit. In the JazzMeet skin, the table that holds the login form inherits  the default table styling given in the content area.  The login form can be identiﬁ ed by userloginForm, so we can remove the  borders. The registration page also displays the table cell borders around elements  in our form, so the borders need to be removed from the table elements in the  userlogin2 div.  userloginForm table, userloginForm th, userloginForm td,  userlogin2 table, userlogin2 td, userlogin2 th { border-width: 0 !important; }  [ 50 ]   wpName1 and wpPassword1 are text boxes that contain the username and  password respectively, of the visitor attempting to log in. wpLoginattempt and  wpMailmypassword identify the input elements that allow a visitor to attempt to log  in with their entered username and password, and have their password emailed to  them if the have forgotten it, respectively. We have previously styled the input boxes  and submit buttons for the edit interface, so we can just add the relevant identiﬁ ers  to the original CSS.     Chapter 2  wpSave, wpDiff,  wpName1, wpPassword1 { background: E6E4D8; border: 2px solid BEB798; color: 38230C; padding: 3px 5px; } wpSave, wpDiff,  wpLoginattempt, wpMailmypassword  { background: E6E4D8; border: 2px solid BEB798; color: 38230C; padding: 3px 5px; }  The check box on the login page  classiﬁ ed by wpRemember  can also be styled, but it  is not necessary for JazzMeet.  JazzMeets So Far  So far, we have an attractive page body, with little or no styling for the surrounding  content such as the userbar, the search box, and the footer information. We will look  at these elements in subsequent chapters.  For now, our pages will appear as shown  in the example below:  [ 51 ]   Formatting the Body  [ 52 ]   Chapter 2  If you are reworking your skin from MonoBook's CSS, you may notice  that some elements such as the column navigation and search feature  hover over your page. This is due to the positioning within the CSS that  has not yet been overwritten or removed. It may be easier to work on  your skin if you comment out the CSS applied to these elements from  your stylesheet.  Summary In this chapter, we have discussed how to style the content section of the wiki. We  have covered the following:               Elements needed to style for the page's main content Styling the edit interface Styling the preview interface and the show changes interface Styling the ﬁ le details pages Styling redirect pages Styling the log in and registration interfaces  In the next few chapters, we will learn how to style the area surrounding the main  content area, and change the layout of your wiki.  [ 53 ]    Formatting Interface  Elements  Our wiki's content is now skinned, but there is still a lot of work to be done to style  and change the layout of the remaining skin. We need to work on the area around  the content block, such as the userbar, the main website navigation, and the links to  various tools for manipulating the information on the wiki page. In this chapter, we  will cover the following:                  Changing your wiki's logo Styling the wiki's navigation Styling your wiki's userbar elements, for example, the "log in" and  "register" links Styling your wiki's page option links, for example, 'edit', and 'discussion' Styling your wiki's toolbox Altering the search feature Changing the footer  The Interface Area: .portlet The area around the main content area is classiﬁ ed by the .portlet class. Beware of  excessively styling this, because by default, the class includes the page's userbar, its  navigation, and the search facility. We can either change the classes applied to these  ﬁ les in our MediaWiki skin's PHP template ﬁ le, or work with the classes and ids  used in other MediaWiki themes such as MonoBook.    Formatting Interface Elements  We have already declared our chosen fonts for the content area, but we can redeﬁ ne  the fonts for the areas surrounding the content. Refer to the following code:  .portlet { font-family: georgia, "times new roman", times, serif; }  Changing the Logo   One of the most obvious things that can be done to alter the appearance of your wiki  is to change the logo. The following ways can be used to achieve this in MediaWiki:           Changing the logo image located at skins common images wiki.png Changing the $wgLogo parameter in the LocalSettings.php ﬁ le  in the root  directory of your MediaWiki installation  Adding the relevant XHTML to your skin's PHP ﬁ le  for example,  skins  JazzMeet.php   The Logo File  In MonoBook, the logo is not inserted as an   element directly in to the XHTML.  It is set as a background image through the use of inline CSS.     text 'logopath'  ?> ;"   href=" data['nav_urls'] ['mainpage']['href'] ?>"<?php echo  $skin->tooltipAndAccesskey 'n-mainpage'  ?>>     The default size for logo images is 135 pixels by 135 pixels. This is the universal size  that is been used for all the default skins that are supplied with MediaWiki.  [ 56 ]   Chapter 3   MediaWiki assumes that the logo is in Portable Network Graphic  PNG  format,  although this can be altered.   Portable Network Graphics with a transparent background will not be  displayed as intended in Internet Explorer 6.  Of course, with JazzMeet, we will need the logo to be of a different size than the  default, as it is rectangular rather than square.   This can be achieved by specifying our own XHTML in JazzMeet's PHP skin  template ﬁ le.  Changing Your Logo in the PHP File  Your wiki's logo can be changed in the PHP template ﬁ le, stored in skins . We  called this ﬁ le JazzMeet.php. Find the p-logo div in this ﬁ le.     text 'logopath'  ?> ;"   href=" data['nav_urls']['main page']['href'] ?>"<?php          echo $skin->tooltipAndAccesskey 'n-mainpage'  ?>>      Replace the content within this div with your own logo XHTML. For JazzMeet, this  will be as follows:             Replacing the logo in the  way just mentioned means that only visitors  who are using your wiki's custom skin will be able to see it. If you allow  visitors to select other skins, they will not see your wiki's custom logo.  [ 57 ]   Formatting Interface Elements  Changing the Logo in LocalSettings.php:  $wgLogo  To change your wiki's logo using the LocalSettings.php ﬁ le, ﬁ nd the line that  begins with $wgLogo, and replace its value with the path to your logo image, relative  to the root directory of your MediaWiki install. Alternatively, you can specify an  absolute path, such as this: http:  www.example.com wiki skins jazzmeet  logo.png. For example, if your wiki has been installed in www.example.com wiki , and your  logo ﬁ le is in www.example.com wiki skins jazzmeet logo.png, the code in the  LocalSettings.php ﬁ le should be as follows:   Logo file to add  called in TemplateName.php  $wgLogo = "skins jazzmeet logo.png";  Changing the Logo File  By replacing the logo ﬁ le, wiki.png, in the skins common images  directory,  you can instantly change your wiki's logo. This directory is the default location for  the wiki's logo, which is used even if the $wgLogo parameter in the LocalSettings. php ﬁ le is not set.  Styling the Navigation: p-navigation    p-navigation identiﬁ es the div that contains the   header above the navigation  links, and .pBody, which includes an unordered list of wiki-wide navigation links.  .pBody is used elsewhere, so as to avoid unnecessary styling.  [ 58 ]   Table of Elements: p-navigation Each list item in the main navigation div has a unique id assigned to it:    Chapter 3  Element class id p-navigation  n-mainpage   n-portal   n-currentevents   n-recentchanges   n-randompage   n-help   n-sitesupport   Purpose p-navigation identiﬁ es the container for the wiki's  primary navigation. n-mainpage identiﬁ es the list item containing a link  to the wiki's main page. n-portal identiﬁ es the list item containing a link to  the wiki's portal page. n-currentevents identiﬁ es the list item containing  a link to the wiki's current events page. n-recentchanges identiﬁ es the list item containing  a link to the recent changes page, which lists the most  recent edits made to your wiki. n-randompage identiﬁ es the list item containing a  link to an existing page in your wiki, chosen at random  each time the link is clicked. n-help identiﬁ es the list item containing a link to  your wiki's help topics. n-sitesupport identiﬁ es the list item containing a  link to a page where your visitors can make a donation  to help pay the running costs of your wiki.  p-navigation contains more than an unordered list of links that acts as the wiki's  main navigation:        Navigation            <a href=" yourwiki Main_Page" title="Visit the  Main Page [z]" accesskey="z">Main Page       <a href=" yourwiki JazzMeet:Community_ Portal" title="About the project, what you can do, where to find  things">Community portal       <a href=" yourwiki Current_events"  title="Find background information on current events">Current events<  a>      <a href=" yourwiki Special: Recentchanges" title="The list of recent changes in the wiki. [r]"  accesskey="r">Recent changes    [ 59 ]   Formatting Interface Elements      <a href=" yourwiki Special:Random"  title="Load a random page [x]" accesskey="x">Random page       <a href=" yourwiki Help:Contents" title="The place  to find out.">Help       <a href=" yourwiki JazzMeet:Site_support"  title="Support us">Donations             Noticeably, the design for JazzMeet does not include the main navigation  links as MonoBook does. This is because features such as the "random  article" link and "community portal" are not needed for JazzMeet.  The Userbar: p-personal In the Western world, MediaWiki's userbar is displayed in the top right of your  screen by default in MonoBook,  and in the top left of the screen for those countries  who read from the right to the left . It is classiﬁ ed with the p-personal div.         Personal tools           <a href=" yourwiki User:Admin" title="My user  page [.]" accesskey=".">Admin       <a href=" yourwiki User_talk:Admin" title="My  talk page [n]" accesskey="n">My talk       <a href=" yourwiki Special:Preferences"  title="My preferences">My preferences       <a href=" yourwiki Special:Watchlist"  title="The list of pages you're monitoring for changes [l]"  accesskey="l">My watchlist       <a href=" yourwiki Special:Contributions  Admin" title="List of my contributions [y]" accesskey="y">My  contributions       <a href=" yourwiki index.php?title=Special:Userl ogout&amp;returnto=JazzMeetDurham" title="Log out">Log out            [ 60 ]   Table of Elements: p-personal  Chapter 3  Element class id  p-personal pt-userpage   n-mytalk   pt-preferences   pt-watchlist   pt-mycontris   pt-logout   pt-login   pt-anonuserpage   pt-anontalk   pt-anonlogin   Purpose p-personal identiﬁ es the container for the userbar. pt-userpage identiﬁ es the list item containing a link to  the user's userpage, if the user is logged in to an account. pt-mytalk identiﬁ es the list item containing a link to  the user's talk  discussion  page, if the user is logged in. pt-preferences identiﬁ es the list item containing a  link to the user's preferences and settings, if the user if  logged in. pt-watchlist identiﬁ es the list item containing a link  to the user's list of currently-watched pages, if the user is  logged in. pt-mycontris identiﬁ es the list item containing a link  to the user's contributions to the wiki. pt-logout identiﬁ es the list item containing a link to  log out of the user's account. pt-login identiﬁ es the list item of the link to the log in  interface where pt-anonlogin is not used. pt-anonuserpage identiﬁ es the list item containing a  link to an anonymous user page, if you are not logged in  to the wiki. pt-anontalk identiﬁ es the list item containing a link  to the user's IP address' discussion  talk  page, if the user  is not logged in. pt-anonlogin identiﬁ es the list item containing a link  to the log in interface.    Most websites' userbars are positioned to the top right of the visitor's screen.  Consequently, this is the ﬁ rst place where your wiki's visitors are likely to look for  this feature on your website. So, moving it to another location could make it less  obvious to your wiki's visitors that they are logged in, or even that there is an option  to register and contribute.  [ 61 ]   Formatting Interface Elements  p-personal and its contents will eventually need moving within the JazzMeet. php ﬁ le to put it in the position we want. We can style the colors to match our new  skin's color scheme, and change the background image to give it a more rounded  appearance at the top.  p-personal { background: 8D1425 url "p-personal_bg.png"  no-repeat top right; color: FFFFFF; float: right;  * To position it *  height: 165px; padding: 10px; width: 170px; } p-personal ul { list-style-type: none;  margin: 0; padding: 0; font-size: 75%; text-align: right; }    p-personal li {    display: inline;     }    p-personal a {    color: FFFFFF;    }  Because this crams all of the user's options into a small box, it is hard to distinguish  between the options. So, we can split some on to new lines in an effort to "group"  them where they will be of more use to JazzMeet's visitors.  To help differentiate these options, we can split the options in to four distinct rows:  The simplest way to split these options is to use display: block to create a new line  for the ﬁ rst listed item of the new line.           The user's homepage link  Admin  The My talk and My preferences links My contributions  Log out   pt-mytalk, pt-contris, pt-logout, pt-anontalk, pt-anonlogin { display: block; }  [ 62 ]   Chapter 3  If you log out, the log-in link is more prominently displayed than the other options,  to encourage JazzMeet's visitors to contribute to the wiki:     View Options: p-cactions    p-cactions deﬁ nes the containing div for the page's viewing options, including  the article, edit, discussion, and page history links.

This is only available if the user is logged in  to an administrator account. ca-delete identiﬁ es the list item containing a link to delete the  current page. This is only available if the user is logged in to an  administrator account. ca-move identiﬁ es the list item of the link to move the page  from its current wiki namespace to another. Again, this option is  only available if the user is logged in as an administrator.  [ 64 ]   Chapter 3  Element class id ca-watch   Purpose ca-watch identiﬁ es the list item containing a link to add the  current page to the watchlist of the user's account. This is only  available for users who are logged in to an account on your wiki.   This account does not have to be an administrator account.  ca-addsection identiﬁ es the list item containing the link to  add a new section. This is on the discussion  talk  pages. The JazzMeet design does not display the "Views" header, which indicates  the purpose of the links beneath it. So, we can hide it in a way similar to the  other headers:   ca-addsection  p-navigation h5, p-search h5, p-tb h5, p-personal h5, p-cactions h5 { display: none !important; }  JazzMeet's design requires that these links are displayed horizontally across the  screen. To overcome the character spacing between each list item, a minor change is  required to create a negative margin to the right of each list item.     The links in our JazzMeet design are deep red with a white background, and a red  border. If a visitor hovers over the link, we ensure that the underlining disappears to  support the idea that they are hovering over a hyperlink.  p-cactions ul { float: right; list-style-type: none; } p-cactions li { display: inline; margin: 0 !important; padding: 0 !important; position: relative; } p-cactions li a { margin: 0 -5px 0 0 !important; }  p-cactions a { background: FFFFFF; border: 1px 8D1425 solid;  color: 8D1425; padding: 3px; text-decoration: none; } p-cactions a:hover { background: 8D1425; color: FFFFFF;  }  [ 65 ]   Formatting Interface Elements  We do not require talk pages on the JazzMeet wiki as the events will be discussed  on the event's page. As a result, we can hide the link to the page's talk page. The  "watch" feature is also unnecessary for JazzMeet, so we will hide that as well.  Because ca-addsection appears only on talk pages, we can hide that as well for  good measure.  ca-talk, ca-watch, ca-addsection { display: none; }  .selected classiﬁ es the list item that is currently selected, to highlight the current  view of the visitor. In JazzMeet, the selected option from the page view options  needs to be white text with a deep red background.  p-cactions li.selected a { background: 8C1425 !important; color: FFFFFF !important; }  This leaves us with a menu that closely resembles the JazzMeet design's page  options.  The current view that is being displayed is highlighted with a red  background. In this example, it is the "article" view.      The Toolbox: p-tb    The toolbox, p-tb provides links to useful tools and features relevant to the current  page in MediaWiki.  As with most of the divs classiﬁ ed by .portlet, the toolbox contains a header  indicating the context of the following content, and an unordered list of links for the  page, including related changes, a link to the ﬁ le upload interface, and a link to a  printable version of the page.

A special page is  preﬁ xed by "Special".  [ 67 ]   Purpose t-print identiﬁ es the list item containing a link to a  printable version of the current page's main content. t-permalink identiﬁ es the list item containing a  link to the current version of the page.  We will start styling the toolbox by hiding the header in the   tag, as we have  with the other elements of the wiki.  Formatting Interface Elements  Element class id t-print   t-permalink   p-tb h5 { display: none; }     Next, we need the list of links to be displayed on one line, as in the JazzMeet design,  these links are located at the bottom of the page. As most of JazzMeet's visitors will  not be looking for these options, we will make the text smaller.  p-tb { font-size: 70%;  } p-tb h5 { display: none; } p-tb ul { list-style-type: none;  } p-tb li { display: inline;  }  p-tb, p-tb a { color: 857F61;  } p-tb a:hover { text-decoration: none;  }  To minimize the focus on these options, we will style the content color and the link  color to beige, and ensure that the underline formatting is removed when a visitor  hovers over a link.  JazzMeet does not require some of the options provided in the toolbox; so they can  be hidden.  t-whatlinkshere, t-permalink, t-recentchangeslinked { display: none;  }  [ 68 ]   We are left with a simpliﬁ ed list of options, which will help minimize unnecessary  content on the page for the beneﬁ t of the wiki's visitor. By removing or hiding them,  we lessen the number of options that are dead-ends for the visitor.      Chapter 3  The Search Box: p-search    The search box in MediaWiki is identiﬁ ed by p-search. The search box contains  a header, indicating the purpose of the content below, an input box to accept the  visitor's search query, and two buttons. The ﬁ rst of these buttons, Go, tries to ﬁ nd a  page in the wiki with a title that exactly matches the user's query. If it does not ﬁ nd  any, it will display the search results page. The second button, Search, displays the  search results page regardless of whether the query matches the title of an existing  page or not.      Search          <input id="searchInput" name="search" type="text" title="Search  JazzMeet [f]" accesskey="f" value=""  > <input type='submit' name="go" class="searchButton"  id="searchGoButton"  <input type='submit' name="fulltext" class="searchButton" id="mw- searchButton" value="Search"  >      value="Go"  >&nbsp;          [ 69 ]   Formatting Interface Elements  Table of Elements: p-search  Element class id  p-search searchInput   searchGoButton   mw-searchButton   Purpose p-search identiﬁ es the container for the search feature. searchInput identiﬁ es the input  text  box used to hold  the visitor's search query. searchGoButton identiﬁ es an input button of type  submit that attempts to ﬁ nd a page with a title matching  the "search" query. If an exact match for title is not  available, a list of search results for the given search term  is displayed. mw-searchButton identiﬁ es another 'submit' button.  This button presents the search results for the search term.  For JazzMeet, we will hide the Go and Search buttons, because if a visitor presses  the return key after entering a query in the search box, the query will be carried out.  We could remove the buttons from JazzMeet.php, but it would be useful to leave  the buttons in the XHTML, without any styling, for those viewing your wiki.  searchGoButton, mw-searchButton { display: none; }     We will also style the search box, searchInput, with a red border and white  background. To make it unique, we will add an icon in the background of the search  box, and alter the padding. Altering the padding is necessary because the query  string should not cover the search icon when it becomes longer than the width of the  input box.  searchInput { background: FFFFFF url "searchInput_bg.png"  no-repeat center right; border: 1px 8D1425 solid;  font-size: 80%; padding: 0; padding-right: 30px; width: 165px }  The ﬁ nal result for the search area is a more simpliﬁ ed interface that will be worked  in to the new skin's layout in due course.      [ 70 ]   The Footer: footer    footer contains the "Powered By MediaWiki" badge, and links to the wiki's privacy  policy, disclaimers, the "about" page,  information about the number of times the  page has been viewed, and the date when it was last modiﬁ ed.  Chapter 3  The footer contains an image  the 'Powered By' button  and an unordered list of  the links.       <img src=" yourwiki skins common  images poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png" alt="Powered by MediaWiki"  ><  a>      <a href=" yourwiki JazzMeet:Privacy_policy"  title="JazzMeet:Privacy policy">Privacy policy    <a href=" yourwiki JazzMeet:About" title="JazzMeet: About">About JazzMeet    <a href=" yourwiki JazzMeet:General_disclaimer"  title="JazzMeet:General disclaimer">Disclaimers         Table of Elements: footer There are a few CSS IDs and classes that need to be considered, that appear in the  footer area of the website by default.   Element class id footer  Purpose footer identiﬁ es the container for the most of your wiki's footer  content including the MediaWiki badge, links to your disclaimer,  copyright policy, and a page that describes the purpose of the wiki   for example, "About JazzMeet" .  f-poweredbyico  f-poweredbyico identiﬁ es a div containing the linked "Powered   By MediaWiki" badge.  [ 71 ]   Formatting Interface Elements  Element class id f-copyrightico  f-copyrightico identiﬁ es a div that contains an image   Purpose  privacy   about   disclaimer   denoting the content licensing type, For example, sGNU. This is not  used in MonoBook by default. privacy identiﬁ es the list item containing the link to your wiki's  privacy policy. about identiﬁ es the list item containing the link to a page about  your wiki and its purpose – the "about us" page. disclaimer identiﬁ es the list item that contains a link to your  wiki's disclaimer.  It is wise to keep these pages on your wiki as they provide information to your  visitors as to what they can do with the content. It will also make sure that you are  not liable for the edits of others.  You can change the appearance of the "Powered By" badge by applying CSS to  f-poweredbyico. To hide it, we can use the following code:  f-poweredbyico { display: none; }  This method leaves the XHTML in the page. To remove it entirely, you will need  to remove the highlighted code below in your skin's PHP template ﬁ le. Of course,  removing it completely means that the visitors do not have to wait for the hidden  content to be loaded. This is a good practice for the search engines as well.  <?php if $this->data['poweredbyico']  { ?>   html 'poweredbyico'  ?>    If you wish to change the "Powered By MediaWiki" graphic, it is stored as  poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png in the skins common images  directory.     In JazzMeet's design, the "Powered By MediaWiki" badge is replaced by a text that  reads "Powered by MediaWiki, from the cool dudes at Wikimedia". To effect this  change, we need to delve in to the JazzMeet.php ﬁ le and change the way  in which  the footer is generated.  Find the code that relates to the footer's list of links. This will be similar to the  code below.    <?php $footerlinks = array  'lastmod', 'viewcount', 'numberofwatchingusers', 'credits',  'copyright','privacy', 'about', 'disclaimer', 'tagline',  [ 72 ]   Chapter 3   ; foreach  $footerlinks as $aLink   { if  isset  $this->data[$aLink]   && $this->data[$aLink]   { ?>  "> html $aLink  ?>  <?php }    } ?>     The $footerlinks array dynamically inserts the footer links based on the values  contained in the array. You can change the URL of the linking pages by changing  the content of the pages within your wiki. For example, to change the "about" link in  the footer, you can edit the content of MediaWiki:Aboutsite to set the text that is  linked, and MediaWiki:Aboutpage to set the link to the relevant page. Similarly, you  can edit:              MediaWiki:Lastmodified to deﬁ ne and display the date on which the page  was last modiﬁ ed MediaWiki:Privacy to change the link text of the privacy policy link in the  footer, and MediaWiki:Privacypage to edit the actual page it links to MediaWiki:Viewcount to alter the way the number of page views for the  current page is displayed MediaWiki:Disclaimers to edit the link text of the link to your disclaimer  page, and MediaWiki:Disclaimerpage to edit the link itself  We can remove "credits"  which provides a link to the credits for your wiki ,  "viewcount"  which displays the number of times the page has been viewed ,  "numberofwatchingusers" and "tagline"  both of which are unused in  MonoBook  as they are not needed in JazzMeet. Now the footer will only contain a  link to a page about JazzMeet and a disclaimer.  $footerlinks = array  'about', 'disclaimer',  ;  numberofwatchingusers The numberofwatchingusers feature shows the number of  visitors watching a particular page in the wiki. It is only shown  if $wgPageShowWatchingUsers = true; appears in your  LocalSettings.php ﬁ le.  [ 73 ]   Formatting Interface Elements     Now we can add our link to MediaWiki back in to the template ﬁ le, just before the  unordered list closes. In case we want to alter the list item uniquely at a later date,  we can assign it the f-poweredby identiﬁ er.   "> html $aLink  ?>  <?php }    } ?>  Powered by <a href="http:  www.mediawiki.org " ti tle="MediaWiki">MediaWiki  from the cool dudes at <a href="http:   www.wikimedia.org " title="Wikimedia">Wikimedia       We can stylize the footer area's content by making the background beige, applying  some dark beige borders,  and providing adequate padding for the contents of the  footer. We can also hide the "Powered By" div, f-poweredbyico, and the copyright  image div, f-copyrightico.  footer { background: D9D5C3; border-color: BEB798; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px 1px 0 30px; color: 38230C; clear: both; font-family: georgia, "times new roman", times, serif; font-size: 75%; line-height: 160%; padding: 10px 0; } footer ul { list-style-type: none; } footer li { display: block;  } footer a, footer a:active, footer a:link, footer a:visited { color: 38230C; } footer a:hover { text-decoration: none;  } f-poweredbyico, f-copyrightico { display: none; }  [ 74 ]      The result looks very similar to our JazzMeet design.  Chapter 3  Summary In this chapter, we saw how to change the areas surrounding a wiki page's main  content, which is classiﬁ ed by .portlet. It includes the following:                 Changing the logo of your wiki Styling your wiki's navigational elements Styling your wiki's userbar elements Styling your wiki's page options Styling your wiki's toolbox links Changing the appearance of the search feature Changing your wiki's footer, including adding, and removing links in the  PHP template ﬁ le  The JazzMeet wiki's elements now look the way we want them to, but they are not  positioned properly on the page. So in the next chapter, we will learn how to alter  the MediaWiki skin's layout.   [ 75 ]    Changing the Layout  In the previous chapters we have seen how to change the wiki's appearance, both  within the "article" content, and the areas surrounding it. Currently, the layout is  not very attractive, as every element has a full-screen width. This means that the  elements you wish to see towards the top of the page, such as your userbar, are  displayed towards the bottom of the page.  Changing the layout of your MediaWiki  skin can overcome this, and will allow you to group the related elements.  In this chapter, we will cover the following:          Altering your wiki pages'   element, including changing the default  page title, using favicons, and altering stylesheet paths Identifying and changing the content block's elements Identifying and changing the surrounding interface's elements  Most wikis retain the two-column layout of MonoBook, and our JazzMeet case study  is no different. The two columns will allow us to show a smaller column for our  "sponsors" alongside the page's main content, without dwarﬁ ng the content itself.  However, the ordering of content within our PHP template ﬁ le, JazzMeet.php,  needs to be changed in order to reﬂ ect the use of a right-hand column  as opposed to  the left-hand column evident in the MonoBook skin .  Keep Your Head On: MediaWiki's    Tag  The   element of the wiki is generated in your skin's PHP template ﬁ le. In our  case, this is JazzMeet.php. It contains the wiki page's title, references to the page's  stylesheets and, in the case of MonoBook, stylesheets to ﬁ x discrepancies in the skin's  display in various versions of browsers. Notably, there are ﬁ xes for Internet Explorer,  Opera, and the KHTML layout engine used by Konqueror and Safari.   Changing the Layout  The Page Title:   and MediaWiki: PageTitle   There are two ways to change the page title of your wiki. The ﬁ rst option is to  alter the value contained within the MediaWiki:Pagetitle page in your wiki's  namespace, to add a slogan after the wiki's name.     $1 – JazzMeet – Jazz Festivals  Borrow the head content from MonoBook: If you did not create your PHP template ﬁ le by copying and renaming  the MonoBook.php ﬁ le, you may ﬁ nd it useful to copy this content from  another MediaWiki skin template  such as MonoBook , as this will  save time.  The second option to change your wiki's page title is to edit the PHP template ﬁ le in  your skins directory, changing the value between the   tags to read:     data['displaytitle']!=""?$this->html 'title' :$this- >text 'title'  ?> &bull; JazzMeet    The  highlighted part of the code retrieves the page article's title. For example,  if you have a page in your wiki called Content, this command retrieves that value  and inserts it in to the   tag of the page. This changes the page title only for  your new skin.   Page Styles: Importing Stylesheets  The following methods can be used to change the stylesheets that your wiki is using:          Change the skin in your user account preferences  covered in Chapter 1  Change the default skin in the LocalSettings.php ﬁ le  also covered in  Chapter 1  Alter the values in the PHP template ﬁ le  The ﬁ rst option does not change the stylesheet for all the visitors of your wiki. You  should be aware that if you allow the users to change their default skin in their  preferences, your wiki could appear "broken" to them. One way to work around  this is to force every one of your wiki's visitors to use your skin. You can do this by  deleting any ﬁ le that is not related to your skin in the skins directory. Be sure to  delete the SkinName.php ﬁ le as well as the associated CSS and image ﬁ les.  [ 78 ]   Chapter 4  Alternatively, you can specify the skins that MediaWiki is to ignore when presenting  a list of available skins to your visitors in their preferences, by adding the names  of the skins that should be skipped to $wgSkinSkins in LocalSettings.php.  For example, to remove all of the default skins, simply add the following to your  LocalSettings.php ﬁ le:   $wgSkipSkins = array "standard", "chick", "cologneblue", "myskin",  "nostalgia", "simple" ;   If you want to specify your wiki's stylesheet by hard-coding it in the template, you  can do it by deleting the following:    *<![CDATA[*     @import " text 'stylepath'  ?> common shared.css?<?php  echo $GLOBALS['wgStyleVersion'] ?>";   >text 'stylename'  ?> main.css?<?php echo $GLOBALS['wgStyleVersion']  ?>";  *]]>*    @import " text 'stylepath'  ?> <?php $this-  You can replace this with the code below, by wrapping the content of the    tags in comments. This will prevent older browsers from "seeing" the stylesheet and  attempting to apply it to the page.         We will also leave the common print stylesheet stored at common commonPrint.css>,  at the top of the page. We will deal with print stylesheets in Chapter 9.  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css" <?php if empty $this- >data['printable']    { ?>media="print"  href="<?php $this- >text 'stylepath'  ?> common commonPrint.css?<?php echo $GLOBALS['wgSt yleVersion'] ?>"  >  Content-Type Declaration  Additionally, you can leave the content-type declaration in the header, since this  helps your wiki visitor's browser:  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"  content=" text 'mimetype'  ?>; charset=<?php $this- >text 'charset'  ?>"  >   You can hard-code this by replacing the code just mentioned in your skin's PHP  template ﬁ le, with your chosen character set. However, this may be a better option  for your wiki, as presenting the wrong charset in a document could cause certain  characters to display improperly.  [ 79 ]   Changing the Layout  usercss and pagecss  It is not advisable to remove the usercss from the top of the page, because this is  used in conjunction with the user's preferences on the wiki. However, if you wish to  override them, you can remove them.  For example, if a user has the "justify paragraphs" option set, and the default wiki  skin speciﬁ es that paragraphs should be right-aligned, the usercss function in the  template will insert an inline CSS in to the head of the document to overwrite the  right-aligned styling, and present the content as fully justiﬁ ed.  }  <?php  if $this->data['usercss'   ]  { ?>    html 'usercss'     ?>     data['pagecss'   ]  { ?>    html 'pagecss'     ?>     The pagecss function inserts page-speciﬁ c styles into the page, and it can be used to  hide things such as the page's main heading, .firstHeading:   In all likelihood, commenting this out from your template ﬁ le, or even removing it  completely, will not produce any adverse effects to your skin. But it is advisable to  leave it in your wiki template's header.  JavaScript: wikibits.js The wikibits.js ﬁ le provides useful JavaScript-based enhancements to MediaWiki  that are quite probably useful for your wiki, too.  if $this->data['jsvarurl'  ]  { ?>  <?php   text 'jsmimetype'  ?>" src="<?php $this- >text 'jsvarurl'    ?>">       Leave both the wikibits.js  stored in common  and site. js ﬁ les linked in the  header. wikibits.js aids wiki-related elements such as the table of contents and  the "diff" interface.  [ 80 ]   Chapter 4  Favicon: favicon.ico  A favicon is a small graphic that appears in the left of your Internet browser's  address bar.  Favicons can help your wiki to be more easily recognized in the  bookmark lists of your visitor's browser, and in the tabs of certain browsers.  The favicon in MediaWiki can be changed in two ways. Firstly, you can upload an  icon image ﬁ le, favicon.ico, to your wiki's root directory. Secondly, you can edit  the  $wgFavicon setting in the LocalSettings.php ﬁ le to $wgScriptPath path to  your favicon.ico, as follows:  $wgFavicon = "$wgScriptPath skins jazzmeet favicon.ico"  $wgScriptPath is your wiki's "base" – the root of your wiki's installation.    Ensure that the entire name of your favicon.ico ﬁ le is in lowercase  characters. Some servers, such as those running on UNIX-based operating  systems, will not display the icon unless its name is completely written  in lowercase.  Changing the Content Area:  bodyContent    If you study the XHTML output from the MonoBook theme, you will notice that  the page's primary content is positioned above the "interface" elements such as the  userbar, page navigation, and the logo. This helps to improve the meaning of the  page's content.  Page Anchors   Towards the top of the document, you will see      as an anchor, identiﬁ ed by top. This allows you to include a "back to the top of this  page" link within your wiki's design. This is unused in MediaWiki's MonoBook skin,  but we can use it for the JazzMeet skin by inserting a link in our template just above  the   of bodyContent  the added code is highlighted :     html 'bodytext'  ?>     data['catlinks']  { ?> <?php        $this->html 'catlinks'  ?>         Top of this  page   [ 81 ]   Changing the Layout             We assigned the paragraph an identity, f-top, to make it easier to style in the  future, if needed. There are more page anchors in the jump-to section.  Headings    Inside content, the wiki page's content area,  there are two headings: the page title   .firstHeading  and your wiki's "tagline"  siteSub . The page title, .firstHeading, is contained within a   tag, as the primary title  for the content:     data['displaytitle']!=""?$this->html 'title' :$this- >text 'title'  ?>    The highlighted PHP retrieves the page's title, and inserts it in the   heading  tags. The tagline is in a level-3 heading    , and will insert "From JazzMeet" to the  page, just beneath the page title.  This will give an indication of where the content  came from. Although we have hidden it using CSS in the JazzMeet skin, we can  remove it from the page in the following manner:     msg 'tagline'  ?>    Alternatively, you can change the tagline that appears in your wiki's new skin by  hard-coding it, as follows:   Courtesy of JazzMeet   The remaining headings within the content area are already styled as desired  for JazzMeet.  Content Blocks  Despite representing the majority of the pages' content in your wiki, the content  block has perhaps the simplest code in the PHP template ﬁ le for your skin.  [ 82 ]   Chapter 4  contentSub  The contentSub divs contain messages that are not frequently needed, such as the  page title of the redirecting template:    html 'subtitle'  ?>   data['undelete']  { ?> <?php      $this->html 'undelete'  ?>    As with most elements in the wiki's main content block, these may look useless to  you, but beware of removing them. The deletion of contentSub makes it difﬁ cult  for an average wiki user to return to the page that he or she was redirected from  for  example, to remove the redirect .  "New Talk"  The new talk block in the template inserts a note in the page, if your wiki's user has  a new message on their talk page  that is, a change has been made to User_Talk: VisitorsUserName . This is displayed for both visitors who are logged in to an  account on your wiki, and anonymous visitors  whose username is their Internet  Protocol address .   data['newtalk']   { ?> <?php  $this->html 'newtalk'   ?> <?php }  Unless you want your wiki's users to be notiﬁ ed of the new messages on their talk  page, it is wise to leave this block in the PHP template ﬁ le. Removing it could just  alienate your wiki's visitors.  Jump-To Links  The jump-to links in MediaWiki's template are inserted by the following code:   data['showjumplinks']  { ?><div id="jump-to- nav"> msg 'jumpto'  ?>  <?php $this- >msg 'jumptonavigation'  ?> ,  <?php $this- >msg 'jumptosearch'  ?>     These provide links to the anchors in the page, such as the navigation and the search  feature. JazzMeet's skin hides them, but we want them to remain in the template ﬁ le  to make the navigation around the page easier, for any visitors using screenreaders.  [ 83 ]   Changing the Layout Page Content  Your wiki's primary content can be retrieved  using the following PHP call:   html 'bodytext'  ?>  It is advisable to insert your wiki page's content once per page. If there is anything  more, it would  quite rightly  be seen as "spam" by the search engines, because it is  unnecessary to repeat your wiki's content multiple times in a page.  Category Links  Category links can be inserted into the wiki's page using the [[Category:Category  Name]] syntax. Traditionally left towards the bottom of the content, they provide a  useful way for the visitors to ﬁ nd pages of a similar topic on your wiki. Assigning  categories to pages also generates lists of all of the pages contained within the  category. You can insert category links in the following way:   data['catlinks']  { ?>   html 'catlinks'  ?>    For JazzMeet, we will leave the category links at the bottom of the page. They have  already been styled to have a smaller text size using CSS to minimize their space on  each page.   Changing the Interface   As demonstrated with the interface elements in Chapter 3, you can add and remove  elements directly from the interface. You can move the content blocks and elements  around, too, to create a different layout.  The editinterface permission: The "editinterface" permission needs to be enabled by you to edit the  interface elements through MediaWiki pages. By default, users having  administrator privileges are able to edit these pages.  MediaWiki Interface Element Pages  In MediaWiki 1.5 and above, you can change your wiki's navigation, and a host of  other interface elements' content. You can do this without having to sift through  PHP, by editing the content of certain pages in your wiki's namespace.  [ 84 ]   Wiki Navigation: MediaWiki:Sidebar The MediaWiki:Sidebar page in your wiki controls the navigation links. The  wiki-syntax for editing this page is as follows:  Chapter 4  * Heading ** Wiki URL of pageLink text * Another heading ** Another wiki URLMore link text  The navigation element in the JazzMeet design was just hidden, and not removed. By  inserting some wiki markup to this page, we can create a useful menu for those who  may be using screenreaders to navigate to some speciﬁ c parts of the wiki.  Blank interface pages: You can prevent anything from being displayed in the interface by editing  the relevant MediaWiki interface pages to read  that is, a single hyphen .  So, if the MediaWiki:Sidebar page contained just a single hyphen, the  navigation links would not appear at all.  * Jazz Festivals in  ** category:JazzMeetUKUK ** category:JazzMeetEuropeEurope ** category:JazzMeetAmericaAmerica ** category:JazzMeetAsiaAsia ** category:JazzMeetAfricaAfrica   This generates a list of hyperlinks to the indicate pages, with the provided link text.  Note that each link is uniquely identiﬁ ed with an id of the linked page's name, and  "n- preﬁ x" as the snippet of XHTML. Refer to the following code:    Jazz Festivals in          <a href="index.php Category: JazzMeetUK">Category:JazzMeetUK       <a href="index.php Category: JazzMeetEurope">Category:JazzMeetEurope       <a href="index.php Category: JazzMeetAmerica">Category:JazzMeetAmerica       <a href="index.php Category: JazzMeetAsia">Category:JazzMeetAsia       <a href="index.php Category: JazzMeetAfrica">Category:JazzMeetAfrica        [ 85 ]   Changing the Layout  The unstyled list will look similar to the following screenshot  assuming there is no  CSS hiding it :  We need to style it to match JazzMeet's appearance. For this , we will give the area a  deep red background and a curved red corner in the top-left corner, as in the concept  for the design, using:  p-Jazz_Festivals_in { background: 8C1425 url "p-jazz_festivals_in_bg.png"  no-repeat top  left; color: FFFFFF; font-size: 70%; padding: 5px; }    p-Jazz_Festivals_in h5 {    color: FFFFFF;    display: inline;     font-weight: normal;    }  W e will give the links in the list a white colored text, remove the bottom border  when the links are hovered over by a visitor, and ensure that the list is displayed on  a single line. Refer to the following code:   p-Jazz_Festivals_in a { border-color: FFFFFF; color: FFFFFF; } p-Jazz_Festivals_in a:hover { border-bottom-width: 0;  } p-Jazz_Festivals_in ul { display: inline; list-style-type: none; margin: 0; } p-Jazz_Festivals_in li { display: inline; margin: 0 5px 0 0; }  [ 86 ]   The navigation now looks similar to the one in JazzMeet's concept.  Chapter 4  MediaWiki:Sitenotice Yo u can insert a site-wide notice in to your wiki's pages by editing the content of  the MediaWiki:Sitenotice page. For example, changing this page's wiki markup  to "This is a site notice – [[JazzMeetDurham]]" will result in the following  message being displayed above the page's main title:      The "Special" Page Tab You  can remove the "special" page tab  that appears on the log in page  by  editing the includes SkinTemplate.php ﬁ le, and commenting out  or removing   the code for this as follows:   *  $content_actions['article'] = array  'class' => 'selected', 'text' => wfMsg 'specialpage' , 'href' => $wgRequest->getRequestURL    ; *   This hides the "special" tab for all skins that have been enabled for your wiki.  MediaWiki: MenuNavigation Your wiki's navigation is, by default, generated in your skin's template ﬁ le. But you  can allow administrators on your wiki to change your wiki's navigation by editing  the MediaWiki:MenuNavigation page's content:   <?php $out = wfMsg  $bar  ; if  wfNoMsg $bar, $out   echo $bar;  else echo $out; ?>       [ 87 ]   Changing the Layout    $val  { ?>  ">  ">            By replacing the highlighted code in your skin's PHP template ﬁ le with <?php  $this->msgWiki  'MenuNavigation'   ?>, you can add navigation to your wiki  by editing the MediaWiki:MenuNavigation page.   The Edit Toolbar   The edit interface's toolbar allows your wiki's visitors to format a page's content with  minimal knowledge of wiki markup. It provides buttons to create links, make the  selected text bold or italic, and insert mathematical formulae and images.  Toolbar buttons Y  ou can add to or remove options from the edit toolbar with relative ease in the  EditPage.php ﬁ le that is in the includes directory of your wiki's installation path.  Find the getEditToolbar   function in this ﬁ le, and you will notice a number of  arrays, each deﬁ ning a single button in the toolbar. As an example, we will consider  the internal link button:  'image'   array   => 'button_link.png',               'id'  => 'mw-editbutton-link',               'open'  => '[[',               'close'  => ']]',               'sample'=> wfMsg 'link_sample' ,               'tip'                'key'          => wfMsg 'link_tip' , => 'L'  The ﬁ rst line deﬁ nes the image to be used for the button. This is stored in skins  common images . The second line assigns an id to the toolbar button, so it can be  uniquely identiﬁ ed. The next two lines, open and close, deﬁ ne the opening and  closing of the wiki markup for the function in question. In this case, [[' opens a  link to another wiki page, whilst ']]' closes the link. The context within  these brackets become the linked text.  [ 88 ]   The sample and tip parameters provide references to the MediaWiki interface pages  that can be edited to provide an explanatory text for your button. The page MediaWiki:link_sample, deﬁ ned by the value sample in the array,  provides an example of the wiki mark-up inserted between the open and close  parameters speciﬁ ed above it. In this case, this contains 'Link title', as this is the  content of the MediaWiki:link_sample page:  Chapter 4  Inserted between the open and close values, this would create a link in wiki  mark-up:  [[Link title]]  The value of tip provides a reference to the MediaWiki:link_tip page, where  you can create a brief description of what it is the button does. Since this button  creates an internal link  i.e., a link to another page within your wiki , its content is  'Internal link'.  Adding a new toolbar button Because JazzMeet is about people interacting and creating jazz festivals, there will  probably be a lot of links to user proﬁ les on the wiki. So, we can add a new "user  page link" button to the edit interface's toolbar as follows:  => 'button_user-link.png', => 'mw-editbutton-userlink', => '[[User:', => ']]',  array   'image'               'id'               'open'               'close'             'sample'=> wfMsg 'user-link_sample' ,            'tip' => wfMsg 'user-link_tip' ,            'key' => 'U'           The order of the arrays affects the order in which the buttons appear in the toolbar.  We will insert our new button at the end of the toolbar, beneath the arrays for other  buttons in the EditPage.php ﬁ le.  [ 89 ]   Changing the Layout  User:Richard  The button images are 23 by 22 pixels in dimension, by default. We   can upload a  new button image to the skins common  im  ages  directory. We will also need  to add the sample and tip text. The sample text should be added to MediaWiki: User-link_sample:  This text is inserted between the opening and closing markup tags of  MediaWiki that have been speciﬁ ed in the array. In this case, they are  "[[' and ']]" respectively.  MediaWiki:User-link_tip can then be edited to provide some help as to what the  button does, and whether a visitor should hover the cursor over it.  Link to a user's page.  The result should be the addition of the "user-link" button to the end of the toolbar  buttons, visible in the edit and the preview interfaces of your wiki.  Creating Your Own Template No w that we have discussed the various blocks and elements in your skin's template  ﬁ le, we can change the layout of the wiki's new skin.  You can use your own classes and ids in your template, but it is better to use  MediaWiki's default names for them, because:            If others edit your skin's template ﬁ le or CSS, it will make it easier for them to  work out what's going on, if they are familiar with MediaWiki. Some class and id names  for example, the navigation list items  are  automatically generated by MediaWiki, by default. It is more consistent, as the other skins for your wiki are presented with those  names. As a result, it is easier to make cross-skin changes.  Ordering Elements As  we have used the MonoBook template as the basis for our new skin, the ordering  of the elements within the page is not quite right for our JazzMeet skin's layout. In  MonoBook, the ordering within the body is as follows:  [ 90 ]      The page's primary content:  Chapter 4     The interface:  Page title Your wiki's tagline "New message" notiﬁ cation, if needed jump-to-nav links, to skip to either the wiki's navigation or  the search feature The content itself The category links, if any The print footer  Views  for example, edit page, view page history  Personal tools  for example, log in, log out, preferences  The logo Navigation Search Toolbox The wiki's footer  Th e following order needs to be adopted to produce the layout required  for JazzMeet:             The page's header, which contains the wiki's logo and the personal  tools element The column content, including links to JazzMeet's sponsors, and the  search feature The views and navigation elements The page's primary content  this remains the same as mentioned earlier   Page title Your wiki's tagline "New message" notiﬁ cation, if needed jump-to-nav links, to skip to either the wiki's navigation or  the search feature The content itself The category links, if any The print footer  [ 91 ]                                                  Changing the Layout       The toolbox The footer  C ontent Ordering Id eally, we want each page's primary content to be as close to the top of the page as  possible. This is not only good for the search engines, as they can instantly see what  your page is about, but is also better for those who use text-only Internet browsers.  Layouts with CSS To  create the basic two-column layout that is required for JazzMeet's design, we can  use the following:  By assigning widths to the content and the column divs and making them ﬂ oat left,  we can easily create a two-column layout that positions the primary content higher  in the page's structure than the content in the column. Thus, the CSS would be  as follows:                      globalWrapper { margin: 0 auto;  * centre the layout *  width: 950px; } content { float: left; width: 710px; } column-one { float: left; width: 215px; }   [ 92 ]   Chapter 4  More CSS-based Layouts: There are a lot of CSS resources on the Internet. Two of the best  are Bluerobot's Layout Reservoir  http:  www.bluerobot. com web layouts  , and Position is Everything  http:  www. positioniseverything.net  .  Moving Blocks Around Cu rrently, the JazzMeet wiki's content is in a single column, with the page's primary  content displayed above other elements such as the toolbox and navigation links,  and the search feature.  Back up your skin template frequently: Moving the content around in the template can become messy. So make  sure you create copies of your skin template frequently, just in case!  JazzMeet's design means that we will need two columns, with the primary content  to the left, and the other content, such as the search feature and our sponsors to the  right, as we demonstrated earlier.  The Header We  have already dealt with the   elements. First in the page's   are the  p-personal element and the wiki's logo, which we need to enclose in a new div to  style them more effectively. We can insert the following existing div inside:         msg 'personaltools'  ?>       data['personal_urls'] as $key => $item  { ?>     "<?php if  $item['active']  { ?> class="active" ><a href="<?php           echo htmlspecialchars $item['href']  ?>"<?php echo $skin- >tooltipAndAccesskey 'pt-'.$key  ?><?php if !empty $item['class']   { ?> class="<?php           echo htmlspecialchars $item['class']  ?>" ><?php           echo htmlspecialchars $item['text']  ?>        [ 93 ]   Changing the Layout              T o  correctly display the above div, we need to specify some style rules:  header { background: FFFFFF url "header_bg.png"  no-repeat top right; height: 85px;  }    header img {    float: left;  }  globalWrapper needs a little styling in order to create a ﬁ xed width design, and to  use a background color for the right-hand column in accordance with our JazzMeet  design. The height of the page content does not matter.Refer to the following code:  globalWrapper { background: D9D5C3; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0; width: 950px; }  The content area needs a deﬁ ned width, and has to ﬂ oat to the left, alongside the  column to its right:  content { background: E6E4D8 url "content_bg.gif"  repeat-y top left; color: 000000; float: left; font-family: georgia, "times new roman", times, serif; padding: 0px 5px 10px 35px; width: 710px; }  [ 94 ]   Chapter 4  As we have inserted the JazzMeet logo in the header, we can remove the PHP that  generates it further down the skin. This code is identiﬁ ed as follows:    <a style="background-image: url skins common images wiki.png ;"  href="index.php Main_Page" title="Visit the Main Page [z]"  accesskey="z">      if  window.isMSIE55  fixalpha  ;     Th e Content Column: column-one The JazzMeet design has a column along the right-hand side of the page's primary  content that displays JazzMeet's sponsors, and some advertisements. In the order of  our page for JazzMeet, this content comes before the page's primary content.  Be neath the closing tag for our new header, we can now add the necessary content  for our column that includes the search feature:          msg 'search'  ?>       text 'searchaction'  ?>"  id="searchform">   too ltipAndAccesskey 'search' ; if  isset  $this->data['search']     {   <input type='submit' name="go" class="searchButton"  id="searchGoButton" value=" msg 'searcharticle'  ?>"   >&nbsp; <input type='submit' name="fulltext" class="searchButton" id="mw- searchButton" value=" msg 'searchbutton'  ?>"  >          ?> value=" text 'search'  ?>"   >      [ 95 ]   Changing the Layout  Above the closing tag for the column-one div, we can include our sponsor's logos,  as well as a header in preparation for the advertisements that will be displayed:    Sponsors     <img src="wiki-install-path sponsor_peacock-carter.png" alt="Sponsor:  Peacock Carter"  >    Advertisements        These images need styling, because we have previously styled images in the  content area:  column-one img { border: 2px BEB798 solid; margin: 7px;  }  We also need to replace the header's text with an image of the text, because most  people will not have Hick Design's "Hill House", the font used in the JazzMeet logo:  h5.sponsors, h5.advertisements { height: 21px; border-bottom: 1px BEB798 solid; border-top: 1px BEB798 solid; width: 195px; } h5.sponsors { background: transparent url "h5_sponsor.png"  no-repeat top left;  } h5.advertisements { background: transparent url "h5_advertisement.png"  no-repeat top  left; } h5.sponsors span, h5.advertisements span { display: none !important; }  [ 96 ]   Chapter 4  The above-mentioned technique is useful for displaying headings and  small amounts of text in a font that many of your visitors may not have.  But beware that its overuse could result in search engine penalties. The  best practice is to use this technique sparingly, and replicate the exact text  within the heading in the image that is replacing it.  The Content Body We n eed to make changes to the content body's order, such as the wiki's navigation,  that appears above the content div, inside column-content. Because we have  deﬁ ned these links in MediaWiki:Sidebar, we need to have them inserted in to the  template dynamically:     <div class='portlet' id='p-<?php echo Sanitizer::escapeId $bar   ?>' tooltip 'p-'.$bar  ?>>   <?php $out = wfMsg  $bar  ; if  wfEmptyMsg $bar, $out   echo $bar;  else echo $out; ?>         $val  { ?>  "<?php if   $val['active']   { ?> class="active"  >  [ 97 ]   Changing the Layout   "<?php echo  $skin->tooltipAndAccesskey $val['id']  ?>><?php echo htmlspecialchars  $val['text']  ?>   <?php           } ?>     The toolbox in the PHP template ﬁ le  look for     should be moved to just above the closing tag for bodyContent, in order to insert  it at the bottom of the primary content area. In the next few chapters, we will learn  how to insert social-bookmarking links and a printable stylesheet for MediaWiki.  The  Footer The  footer for the JazzMeet skin is located just outside the content div. Refer to the  following code:          <?php       $footerlinks = array        'about', 'disclaimer',  ;       foreach  $footerlinks as $aLink   {          if  isset  $this->data[$aLink]   && $this->data[$aLink]   { ?>     "> html $aLink  ?>  <?php } } ?>  Powered by <a href="http:  www.mediawiki.org " ti tle="MediaWiki">MediaWiki  from the cool dudes at <a href="http:   www.wikimedia.org " title="Wikimedia">Wikimedia    <a href="top" title="Return to the top of this  page">Top of this page        [ 98 ]   Chapter 4  This dynamically inserts links to the "about" and "disclaimers" pages of our wiki, and  statically inserts a link back to MediaWiki and Wikimedia. End Of The Template File Be s ure to include the code  if  window. runOnloadHook  runOnloadHook  ;  just above the   tag in your  template ﬁ le. Some of the functions in MediaWiki rely on it. You will also need to  restore warnings  wfRestoreWarnings    in the PHP ﬁ le, once your template has  been created:   html 'bottomscripts' ;  * JS call to runBodyOnloadHook *   ?>    html 'reporttime'  ?>  if  window.runOnloadHook   runOnloadHook  ;      <?php    wfRestoreWarnings  ; }    end of execute   method }    end of class ?>   html 'reporttime'  ?> creates commented text at the bottom of  your wiki's page.  The Result The  resulting pages, and the associated style and images generated with the  template, resemble our vision for JazzMeet a lot more closely.  [ 99 ]   Changing the Layout  [ 100 ]   Chapter 4  Summary In this chapter, we discussed how to change the layout of your MediaWiki skin, as  well as the possible alterations that can be made to the   element of the wiki's  template. Thus, we have covered the following:            The elements of the wiki's   block, and their characteristics The elements of the wiki's content block, and their characteristics The elements of the wiki's interface, their characteristics, and the ways in  which we can add additional buttons to the edit interface's toolbar Creating your new skin's PHP template ﬁ le, by merging the elements from an  existing skin in to your skin's XHTML ﬁ le  [ 101 ]    Useful MediaWiki Functions   A MediaWiki skin template ﬁ le, which is similar to JazzMeet.php, is a mixture of  PHP and XHTML, with a smattering of JavaScript and inline CSS as well. There  are a signiﬁ cant number of useful PHP-based MediaWiki functions that can be used   in some cases, re-used  to modify your wiki's skin. In this chapter, we will discuss  the following:           The basics of how to use MediaWiki functions in your skin Useful functions for your wiki's   section Functions for your wiki's content area Functions for your wiki's interface area  PHP Functions and MediaWiki Functions   PHP functions are built-in functions of the PHP language. For example, the  str_replace function allows you to replace one substring with another, within  a string.  MediaWiki functions extend the PHP functions in a way that is helpful for  your MediaWiki wiki. Some of these are in the SkinTemplate.php ﬁ le in the  includes directory, and there are yet more functions in the Skins.php ﬁ le in the  same directory.  Using MediaWiki Functions  To get data from MediaWiki to your page, there are two steps:       Retrieving the data, via a function or a variable Formatting the data in a suitable format   Useful MediaWiki Functions Retrieving the Data  Before we can do anything with the information, we need to retrieve it, be it from a  variable, or from a function. Retrieving Data from a Variable  To retrieve data from a variable, you can just call it in your skin template. For  example, to retrieve the data within the variable "var" from the object "Object", all  you need to do is this:  $Object['var']  Although this retrieves the value that the variable is holding, it does not output   that is display  the variable. To do this, we use PHP's echo language constraint   a sort of function :     The variables you can access in your skin template are preﬁ xed with  "$tpl" in the SkinTemplate.php ﬁ le.  Retrieving Data from a Function  In a similar way, we can retrieve data from a function to use it in our skin template.  Using the function getData  , we will retrieve the data stored within the "var"  variable from "Object":  $Object -> getData 'var'   Again, we need to output this using echo:    getData 'var'  ?>  Now that we have the data, it is simply a matter of ensuring that it is formatted to  suit our needs.  Formatting the Data  Once you have accessed the information you need from MediaWiki functions, it may  need to be converted in to a suitable format for output. For example, if the function  or variable that used to give you data returned a URL you would probably need to  ensure that the URL was properly 'escaped'  so 'and' becomes '&amp;', and so on .  The following are some useful transformations:        html htmlentities  [ 104 ]   Chapter 5  text  urlencode  htmlspecialchars        html  html is particular to MediaWiki, and acts in a similar way to text. htmlentities  htmlentities   is used to escape all characters that have HTML equivalents. To  decode data in htmlentities format, you can use the html_entity_decode    function. htmlspecialchars  You can use htmlspecialchars   to escape just a few of the following characters,  which are most likely to cause problems in XHTML: the ampersand, double quote,  single quote, and the less than and greater than characters. text  Perhaps not surprisingly, you can use text    again, particular to MediaWiki  to  insert the retrieved information in your skin template. This function simply returns  the unaltered variable or value with no changes.  Let's suppose that we want to insert the page title elsewhere in our MediaWiki skin  template. To retrieve it, we need to retrieve the data from $this, and format its  output as a text within a paragraph:     text 'title'  ?>    We will have a look at some examples of both the retrieval and formatting  of variables.  Functions for    We covered the basics of the   element in your MediaWiki skin template  in the previous chapter, but we can still make some changes in the head of the  wiki template.  [ 105 ]   Useful MediaWiki Functions  Headlinks   html 'headlinks'  ?> retrieves links to favicons for use with  MediaWiki  as speciﬁ ed by the $wgFavicon variable in the LocalSettings.php  ﬁ le , and also provides a reference to your wiki's Open Search Description. It thus  produces XHTML code similar to the following:    <link rel="search" type="application opensearchdescription+xml"  href=" richard.carter book v1 opensearch_desc.php" title="JazzMeet   English "  >  This function also inserts related keywords in the   of the page, based on the  title of the page, and the internal links within the page's content.     Pagetitle   The wiki's current page title can be inserted in the page using the <?php $this- >text 'pagetitle'  ?> function. Notice that the formatting of this data is text, as  opposed to anything else, as it is used directly in the page as content. Most MediaWiki skins use this only once: within the   tags, and again in  the content block, in the   element. But .firstHeading may beneﬁ t your wiki's  visitors to insert the page title again. For example, you may wish to include the  page's title in a link to a social bookmarking website such as Digg:  <a href="http:  www.digg.com submit?url=http:  www.example. com&amp;title=  html 'pagetitle'  ?>" title="Add this page  to Digg!"> Add this page,  text 'pagetitle'  ?>, to Digg!    The formatting of the ﬁ rst instance is html, because the page title is being used  within a link.  ServerURL   serverurl returns the URL of the server on which MediaWiki is installed. This is  generally the domain of your website, for example http:  www.example.com. For  most uses, this should be encoded using urlencode.   urlencode 'serverurl'  ?>  [ 106 ]   Chapter 5  Skinname   skinname is the variable holding the current MediaWiki skin's name. In the case  of JazzMeet, it would return jazzmeet. For example, if you want to specify the  stylesheet on your own, you can insert the following into your skin template:    <!-- @import "skins  text 'skinname'  ?> main.css" -->    The value of this variable is set at the top of your skin's PHP template ﬁ le,  in a line similar to this: $this->skinname  = 'jazzmeet'  Stylepath    text 'stylepath'  ?> returns the directory used by your  installation of MediaWiki to refer to its skins. By default, this is  skins common  shared.css and the location of the current skin's stylesheet is  skins jazzmeet  main.css, for JazzMeet.  The Style Path: The variable returned here can be speciﬁ ed in the LocalSettings.php  ﬁ le. It is called as $wgStylePath.  Stylename   stylename holds the value of your skin's style name. It is generally similar to the  value of skinname.  StyleVersion     adds the current version of the  style  an integer  to the page, and in the MonoBook theme, it is added after the  speciﬁ ed stylesheet's path.  TrackbackHTML   The PHP if  $this->data['trackbackhtml']  print $this- >data['trackbackhtml']; ?> inserts trackback links in to the head of your  wiki's page.  [ 107 ]   Useful MediaWiki Functions  Trackback links provide a way of requesting notiﬁ cation when someone  links to a page on your wiki. For more information, refer to the  Wikipedia's article on Trackbacks at: http:  en.wikipedia.org  wiki Trackback.  UserCSS   usercss holds any additional style that has been requested by the user, and needs  to be nested within   tags, for example, formatting paragraphs' alignment to  be justiﬁ ed.     html 'usercss'     ?>    Functions For    The body of your wiki can be split in two distinct areas: First is the content area,  which contains the majority of the page's content, including that page's editable  content within MediaWiki.  Second is the interface area, which includes menu links,  your wiki's logo, and the footer.  Within    Two JavaScript events, "inserted if" and "when required"' and a unique class for  the page are inserted in to the   tag of each page in MediaWiki. A typical  page's   tag looks similar to the following code. Note the absence of the  JavaScript events:     The JavaScript events provide for double-clicking events, and the page load event.  They are required on the page being generated by the PHP template:   data['body_ondblclick']  { ?>ondblclick="<?php $this- >text 'body_ondblclick'  ?>"    data['body_onload'    ]  { ?>onload="<?php     $this- >text 'body_onload'      ?>"   The page class insertion consists of a number of functions. Within the class""  assignment, .dir returns the direction of the wiki's content  either ltr or rtl,  left-to-right and right-to-left, respectively  .pageclass inserts the remainder of the   [ 108 ]   page's class in the page, based on the current page's title, in the format  page-Page_Title, where Page_Title is the title of the current wiki page.   text 'nsclass'  ?>  text 'dir'   ?>  text 'pageclass'  ?>">  Chapter 5   Spacing between class names: Note the spacing between the functions that return the class names for  a page. Without spacing, the page will not be assigned the multiple  classes that are intended, but one class, which is a concatenation of all of  your intended classes.  Functions for page content   In MediaWiki, the page content has a number of functions associated with it,  including those for inserting:                The "sitenotice", a globally-displayed notice controlled by the wiki's  administrators. The subtitle of your wiki into the page: This is the name of your wiki,  preﬁ xed with the word "from". For example, in Wikipedia, this is  "From Wikipedia". A notiﬁ cation if a user has a new message on his her talk page The internal page navigation links, to skip to the other areas of the page, for  example, the top or the search box. The page's user-contributed content, the "bodycontent".  ArticleID   articleid holds the value of the current article's unique identiﬁ cation number,  which is used in keeping track of your articles' versions. Generally, we would want  to retrieve this data as text:   text 'articleid'  ?>  Bodytext  The wiki page's main content, the "bodytext"', is inserted with this simple command:   html 'bodytext'  ?>. This inserts the formatted XHTML that  constitutes the content of the page.  [ 109 ]   Useful MediaWiki Functions Category Links  The category links associated with each page are inserted in a conditional statement:   data['catlinks']  { ?>    html 'catlinks'  ?>      Traditionally in MediaWiki, the category links are inserted directly below the  primary content. This makes sense, because providing a way for your visitors to ﬁ nd  related information under the article or page that they just read will keep your wiki's  visitor reading the content on your wiki.  Jump to navigation links  The jump-to-nav div contains links to other areas of the page. While some of these  may be hidden, they still provide a useful guide for visitors who are not viewing  your wiki through a conventional browser.  Using a conditional PHP statement, these links are only shown if needed. <?php  $this->msg 'jumpto'  ?> retrieves the text as shown here:   data['showjumplinks']  { ?>    msg 'jumpto'  ?>    msg 'jumptonavigation'  ?>  ,     msg 'jumptosearch'  ?>        Page Anchors: The links to your wiki's search box and navigation will work only if you  have included the page anchors in the relevant place in your wiki's PHP  template ﬁ le.  [ 110 ]   Chapter 5  Message Notification  When one of your wiki's users receive a new message on their talk page  for  example, if you are logged in as "Richard", and a change is made to User_talk:  Richard , a notiﬁ cation appears on the next page they view to tell them that a new  message has been received. This notiﬁ cation appears in a div of class usermessage.  The div contains a conditional statement in PHP, which only inserts the notiﬁ cation  if a new message exists for the user:   data['newtalk']   { ?>    html 'newtalk'   ?>      So, if there is no new message for the user, no XHTML is generated. Otherwise, the  following XHTML is generated by MediaWiki:    You have <a href=" index.php?title=User_talk:Admin&amp;redirect=no"  title="User talk:Admin">new messages   <a href="index. php?title=User_talk:Admin&amp;diff=cur" title="User talk:Admin">last  change  .     Pagetitle  The page title is inserted in the wiki page, if the page title is not empty. The  following is MonoBook's lead in   tags of class. .firstHeading:     data['displaytitle']!=""?$this->html 'title' :$this- >text 'title'  ?>    Beware of over-inserting the page title as over-use could harm your wiki's  search engine rankings.  [ 111 ]   Useful MediaWiki Functions Sitenotice  Because we need to check for the existence of a sitenotice before inserting it, we can  use a conditional check, which inserts it if, and only if, the sitenotice is not empty.  This is done in the same way as the 'new message' notiﬁ cation is inserted, above.    data['sitenotice']  { ?>    html 'sitenotice'  ?>     MediaWiki: Sitenotice You can change your wiki's sitenotice content by editing the  MediaWiki:Sitenotice page. You will need to be logged in as an  administrator or sysop to edit this page.  Subtitle and Redirects  When a visitor goes to a page in your wiki that redirects to another page, a message  is included beneath the page title to inform the visitor of the page from which he or  she was redirected:     html 'subtitle'  ?>    The function highlighted above inserts this value in to the page in MediaWiki.  Tagline  The tagline function, highlighted below, inserts 'From JazzMeet'  or whatever your  wiki's name is, as speciﬁ ed when you initialized your wiki  in to the wiki's page.  In keeping with MonoBook's system of naming for the elements of wiki pages, the  tagline is included within the siteSub div:     msg 'tagline'  ?>    Undelete  The undelete function inserts a link to restore an article you have deleted from the  wiki as a user with the administrator privileges. This is inserted only if it is needed in  the page:   data['undelete']  { ?>    html 'undelete'  ?>      [ 112 ]   The default message text is "View or restore one deleted edit", as shown the  following screenshot:  Chapter 5  Footer T he footer links in your wiki are, as with the other menus and lists, inserted  dynamically as an unordered list in XHTML, with an array  a list  of the links deﬁ ned  within the PHP ﬁ le itself. The array speciﬁ es the links that should be included:    <?php $footerlinks = array     'about', 'disclaimer',  ; foreach  $footerlinks as $aLink   { if  isset  $this->data[$aLink]   && $this->data[$aLink]   { ?>  "> html $aLink  ?>  <?php } } ?>    Both isset $var  and $var will return false when var does not  contain a value. So $this->data[$alink] is probably sufﬁ cient. We  will leave isset there just in case, though.  The following code inserts the "about" and "disclaimer" links on the page:    <a href=" richard.carter book v1 index.php JazzMeet:About"  title="JazzMeet:About">About JazzMeet      <a href=" richard.carter book v1 index.php JazzMeet:General_ disclaimer" title="JazzMeet:General disclaimer">Disclaimers     [ 113 ]   Useful MediaWiki Functions  Functions for the Interface T  he interface area of MediaWiki is, as with the content area, generated through  functions and variables that dynamically insert the logo, your wiki's navigation, and  the footer links.  Logopath T he  text 'logopath'  ?> function inserts the path of your wiki's  logo, as deﬁ ned by $wgLogo in LocalSettings.php. Depending on the value you have  given this variable, it may be an absolute URL  for example, http:  www.example. com images logo.gif , or a relative URL  for example, images logo.gif . Non- Special Pages T he ﬁ rst toolbox links to be inserted in the page are those for "normal" MediaWiki  pages. So, we need a way of checking if the page is "special"  that is, preﬁ xed with  Special, for example, Special:Recentchanges :   data['notspecialpage']  { ?>  *  code to be inserted if the page is not 'special' goes here *  } ?>  Whatlinkshere T he whatlinkshere feature provides a link to the page that lists pages every page  on your wiki that links to the current page. This can also be inserted in to your  MediaWiki template as follows:   <a href=" <?php echo htmlspecialchars $this->data['nav_urls']['whatlinkshere']['href' ] ?>"  tooltipAndAccesskey 't-whatlinkshere'  ?> >  msg 'whatlinkshere'  ?>      Once the page is loaded, the XHTML in the page should look similar to the one  given here:    <a href="index.php Special:Whatlinkshere JazzMeetDurham" title="List  of all wiki pages that link here [j]" accesskey="j">What links here<  a>    [ 114 ]   Chapter 5  Recent Changes W e will add the link to the recent changes page link next, again within our  conditional statement to check if the page is special:   data['nav_urls']['recentchangeslinked']   { ?>   <a href="  data['nav_urls']['recentchangeslink ed']['href'] ?>"  tooltipAndAccesskey 't-recentchangeslinked'  ?> >  msg 'recentchangeslinked'  ?>      This PHP code results in XHTML for only one link:    <a href=" index.php Special:Recentchangeslinked JazzMeetDurham"  title="Recent changes in pages linked from this page [k]"  accesskey="k">Related changes     Printable Version  The link to the printable version of the current page is a generated link. Obviously,  this would need to be within the conditional statement to check that you are not  generating a link to a printable version of a page that is a special page.  if !empty $this->data['nav_urls']['print']['href']   { ?>    data['nav_urls']['print'] ['href'] ?>"  tooltipAndAccesskey 't-print'  ?>>  msg 'printableversion'  ?>    <?php}  With a similar result to the previous examples, this code inserts a list item containing  a link to the printable version of the page, assuming that the page is "non-special":    <a href=" index.php?title=JazzMeetDurham&amp;printable=yes"  title="Printable version of this page [p]" accesskey="p">Printable  version     [ 115 ]   Useful MediaWiki Functions Personal Tools  The personal tool links-those for your user page, talk page and your preferences-are  also inserted on each page of your wiki as generated links, based on whether you are  logged in to an account or not, and whether you have administrator privileges. The  title is called in a similar manner to the one for the "views" section:     msg 'personaltools'  ?>    Again, the links for the personal tool-bar are inserted iteratively in an unordered list:     data['personal_urls'] as $key => $item  { ?>  "<?php if  $item['active']  { ?> class="active" >  "  tooltipAndAccesskey 'pt-'.$key  ?>    class=" " >             Search  The title for the search feature in MediaWiki can be inserted in a header tag thus:     msg 'search'  ?>    The search form consists of one input ﬁ eld for the visitor's search term, and  two inputs of type submit, one of which to search for the given phrase s , we  have hidden for JazzMeet using CSS. Of particular interest to us is <?php $this- >text 'searchaction'  ?>, which inserts the needed action for the search form  to function:   text 'searchaction'  ?>" id="searchform">  too ltipAndAccesskey 'search' ; if  isset  $this->data['search']     {?> value="<?php $this- >text 'search'  ?>"   >  [ 116 ]   <input type='submit' name="go" class="searchButton" id="searchGoButton "value=" msg 'searcharticle'  ?>"  > <input type='submit' name="fulltext" class="searchButton" id="mw- searchButton" value=" msg 'searchbutton'  ?>"  >    Chapter 5  This results in a change in the form action parameter, as follows:         Views  The views section of MediaWiki lists the different views for the current page: the edit  interface, the page's edit history, and any administrator actions available, such as  delete and move. Retrieving the title for this section  in   tags, in both MonoBook and our JazzMeet  template  requires a simple function call:     msg 'views'  ?>    To generate the list of relevant links for the page, the PHP gets a little more complex,  with MediaWiki inserting them iteratively:     data['content_actions'] as $key => $tab  { ?>  "   class="<?php echo htmlspecialchars $tab[' class']  ?>" >  "<?php echo  $skin->tooltipAndAccesskey 'ca-'.$key  ?>><?php echo htmlspecialchars $tab['text']  ?>          [ 117 ]   Useful MediaWiki Functions  Logged in, and on a normal article page such as JazzMeetDurham, as used in the  example below, this would generate content similar to the following, with each link's  href, title, and accesskey parameters populated with the relevant information:   Views      <a href="index.php JazzMeetDurham" title="View the content page [c]"  accesskey="c">Article      <a href="index.php Talk:JazzMeetDurham" title="Discussion about the  content page [t]" accesskey="t">Discussion     <a href="index.php?title=JazzMeetDurham&amp;action=edit" title="You  can edit this page.

This means, there are  many "if" statements in this section.  Each list item inserted in a communal unordered list, which generates an XHTML  similar to the following:      <a href=" Special:Whatlinkshere Test" title="List of all wiki pages   [ 118 ]   Chapter 5  that link here [j]" accesskey="j">What links here      <a href="Special:Upload" title="Upload images or media files [u]"  accesskey="u">Upload file      <a href="Special:Specialpages" title="List of all special pages [q]"  accesskey="q">Special pages       Loose Ends   There are a few commands that are useful if you are attempting to debug problems  with your MediaWiki install, as well as a request to run any JavaScript associated  with the page once the page has been loaded.  Bottomscripts  The "bottomscripts" command,  html 'bottomscripts' ; ?>,  inserts a call to run any JavaScript reliant on the loading of the page. This is best  left towards the bottom of your template ﬁ le, as including it higher up in your  template ﬁ le may make the JavaScript run before the page has been fully generated  by MediaWiki.  Debugging  The debug function can be used to insert commented text in your template to help  you debug MediaWiki:   data['debug']  : ?> <!-- Debug output:  text  'debug'  ; ?> -->    Debugging MediaWiki: For more information on debugging MediaWiki, see http:  www. mediawiki.org wiki How_to_debug_MediaWiki.  [ 119 ]   Useful MediaWiki Functions Reporttime  The "reporttime" function in MediaWiki,  html 'reporttime'  ?>,  inserts commented text in the page that reports the time taken to generate the page  just before the   tag.     This is inserted in an HTML comment to prevent it being visible to your visitors, but  still allows you to check whether there are any huge delays in the page loading.  Restoring Warnings  The wfRestoreWarnings   method call enables warnings to be displayed once the  page has been generated. At the start of your skin ﬁ le, if wfSuppressWarnings   is  inserted before the HTML document type declaration, errors are disabled from being  displayed in the page. This is a wise move with regards to the security, as it helps to  prevent ﬂ aws that can be exploited to damage your wiki:  <?php wfRestoreWarnings  ;} } ?>  Advanced PHP Functions By looking through the SkinTemplate.php ﬁ le in your MediaWiki install's directory,  you can ﬁ nd lots of useful functions to extend the information you can dynamically  insert in your wiki pages.  Global Variables  The SkinTemplate.php ﬁ le contains "global variables" that you can insert in your  wiki page using this simple PHP:  <?php echo  $GLOBALS['name_of_global_variable'];  ?>  [ 120 ]   The echo command inserts the value returned from the $GLOBALS that follows it. The  following are the variables you can use:   Chapter 5                        wgTitle inserts the current page's title. wgScript inserts your MediaWiki installation's script path. The script path  is the part of the URL before your page title. For example, if your wiki was  installed in the directory wiki  on your website, the script path would be  wiki index.php. wgStylePath inserts your wiki's skins directory. wgContLanguageCode inserts the ISO language code of the content. In most  cases, it will be "en" for English. wgMimeType inserts the MIME  Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions  type  of the content being returned. This is "text" or "html", by default. wgOutputEncoding inserts the character encoding type. The most frequent  values for this are "UTF-8" and "ISO-8859-1". wgServer inserts the address of the server of your MediaWiki installation.  For example, if your wiki is installed on www.example.com, wgServer returns  http:  www.example.com. wgArticlePath inserts the relative path of your wiki articles. For example,  if your wiki is installed in the wiki directory, it would return wiki index. php $1. The $1 refers to the parameter of the article name.  Example: Dynamically Creating Linking Code   We will make use of some of the functions that were explained earlier to dynamically  create the code that can be used by our wiki's visitors in order to link to the  current page.   Link to this page!    <a href="  <?php echo $GLOBALS['wgScript'];  ?>   title=" ">"   ' ' on JazzMeet      [ 121 ]   Useful MediaWiki Functions  For the page JazzMeetNewcastle on our JazzMeet wiki, located at www.jazzmeet. com wiki JazzMeetNewcastle, this would generate something similar to the  following screenshot:  Overview: Variables at a Glance T he outputPage function in the includes SkinTemplate.php ﬁ le gives us more  options for content that we can insert in to our MediaWiki pages dynamically, some  of which are included as an easy reference to the content covered in this chapter.  $this->text $var  will print the variable as plain text, whereas $this- >html $var  will print the HTML content of the variable  where appropriate, and  where possible .  $this->data $var  is used to check whether or not the variable  contains data.  "text" Variables T he "text" template variables can be accessed with the type "text"  see the following  example . These include:                 title: This is the page's title. pagetitle: This is the page's title and your wiki's title  as set in MediaWiki: Pagetitle , concatenated. pageclass: This is the class assigned to the body of your wiki page. For the  main page, this is page-Main_Page, although the syntax  that is, preceding  page  can be removed quite easily by editing the SkinTemplate.php ﬁ le. articleid: This is the numerical identiﬁ er of the article. The main Page's  articleid is  usually  1. currevisionid: This is the version number of the current version of the page.  [ 122 ]                      Chapter 5  skinname: This is the name of the default skin for your wiki. This is  'JazzMeet' for our case study. stylename: This is the directory of the current default skin. This is  'Jazzmeet' for the JazzMeet wiki. userpage: This is the MediaWiki URL to the visitor's userpage. If you are  logged in as "Richard", this is User:Richard. Also see "userpageurl". viewcount: This is a message that tells you how many times the current  page has been accessed. The message reads, "This page has been accessed 'x'  times."  These variables can be inserted into the page in a way similar to the global variables  described earlier. To insert the page title in the page without using the global  variable, you can use the following:   text 'title'  ?>  "html" Variables T he "html" variables can be used in a way similar to the "text" variables that were  described earlier  and, indeed, can be requested as "text" variables, with varying  results . These include the following:  catlinks: This links to the page's relevant categories  if any . headlinks: These are the meta keywords and favicon link in the header. userpageurl: This is the relative URL to the vistors's userpage. It returns  something similar to: wiki index.php User:Richard.  Calling the "html" function before retrieving the values ensures that the returned  value is displayed as HTML. If we want to insert another instance of the page's  category links into the page, we can use the following:   html 'catlinks'  ?>  This inserts the relevant HTML for the page's categories in the following format,  assuming the page's only category is called "Test":    <a href="wiki index.php Special:Categories" title="Special: Categories">Category :  <a href="wiki index. php?title=Category:Test&amp;action=edit" title="Category:Test">Test<  a>     [ 123 ]   Useful MediaWiki Functions   Summary In this chapter we discussed the various functions for inserting useful information in  your wiki dynamically. This included the following:        Functions for retrieving and inserting data from both variables  and functions Inserting global variables in your MediaWiki template  In the next chapter, we will discuss adding decorative elements to your wiki, and    integrating social bookmarking websites in your wiki.  [ 124 ]   Adding Decorative Elements  The design of our JazzMeet wiki is preliminarily complete, but we can enhance it in  terms of user-friendliness, by adding decorative elements. In this chapter, we will  cover the following:       The decorative elements you can use in your wiki The techniques you can use in your wiki to draw your visitor's focus both  toward elements and away from elements  Decorative Elements   A decorative element is not essential to your wiki's skin, but adds some value to  it. This value could give your wiki a certain attitude or a distinctive element over  a competitor's wiki, or help your visitors perform some task on your wiki, such as  ﬁ nding the information they are looking for using the search box feature.  When to Use Decorative Elements  It is important to use the decorative elements in your MediaWiki skin sparingly, so  as not to detract from the wiki's content, which is why most of your visitors are on  your wiki in the ﬁ rst place.  Having said that, a white page with black text is not very welcoming for your  visitors, and decorative elements can help make your wiki more visitor-friendly.   As a general guide, it is probably OK to use decorative elements when:         Your page is a somewhat sparse Something on your page needs more focus than it currently has The wrong elements on your page have too much focus  for example,  through poor choice in layout , and you need to draw attention to other  elements on the page    Adding Decorative Elements  Whilst it is always a good idea to plan what goes where before you design your  MediaWiki skin, this is not always practical. For example, you may ﬁ nd that once  your wiki has been up and running for a while, you want to add or change the  decorative elements based on comments from your visitors, or want to make changes  based on analysis of your website's statistics.  Focus-Drawing Techniques You can draw focus to an element on your wiki by using one or more of the  following techniques:                     Suggestion of movement, including the use of arrows Color contrast Diagonal lines Indentation Padding Size Ordering Depth, and the impression of 3D  Suggestion of Movement  Our eyes are designed to respond to movement. Anything that appears to be moving   or actually is moving , will tend to draw your visitors' focus.  Movement and Advertisements: Beware of making things that look like animated banner adverts, as your  visitors may associate these with advertisements and ignore them. Refer  to: http:  www.useit.com alertbox 9709a.html.  [ 126 ]   For example, by applying a motion blur to each of the sponsors' logos, we can attract  our visitors' attention to them:  Chapter 6  On the other hand, this motion blur makes the logos less legible for our visitors. So  we should clearly exercise caution here.   Drawing Focus with Arrows A  good way to suggest movement is with the use of arrows. The tip of the arrow will  drive your visitors' attention towards whatever it is pointing at, as we can see in the  following example:  [ 127 ]   Adding Decorative Elements  Th e arrows can help to guide visitors through your wiki, and help to enforce the  hierarchy of the content. For example, let's assume that our ﬁ rst sponsor was paying  more than the second, and we wanted our visitors to view these. We could use arrows  to suggest to our visitors the order in which they view our sponsors' logos, and thus,  theoretically at least, the ﬁ rst sponsor gains the most attention from our visitors:  Alternatively, we can reverse the arrows to suggest a reversal in the hierarchy of the  sponsors' logos, such that the lower logo is given a greater focus than the ﬁ rst:     Color Contrast The   use of color and contrast in your design can also help to tell your visitors what is  more important on your wiki.  If your design is predominantly blue, an orange element will stand out more than a  different shade of orange, as orange and blue are on opposite sides of the "color wheel".  For this technique to work well, you need to have the majority of your  design in a single color, or a variation of that color.  [ 128 ]   The Color Wheel  Chapter 6  Let's  assume that the JazzMeet's sponsors  in the right-hand column of our original  design  weren't happy with the percentage of visitors who visited their websites  from our wiki. The beige border surrounding the logos  BEB798  was originally  designed to indicate to JazzMeet's visitors that the sponsors' logos on the wiki were  not very important to the page content.  We can change the contrast of the sponsors' logos by changing the border color that  surrounds them from beige  close to orange on the color wheel  to its opposite on the  color wheel, a shade of blue.     [ 129 ]   Adding Decorative Elements  Grayscale and Monotone Using g  rayscale and monotone images can be just as striking as the use  of vivid colors. This is illustrated by Khoi Vinh on his personal blog, Subtraction   http:  www.subtraction.com :      [ 130 ]   This effect is demonstrated on JazzMeet's sponsor logos in the following screenshot.  As JazzMeet's design is quite colorful, the effect is signiﬁ cantly reduced:  Chapter 6  Diagonal Lines Diagonal  lines, or an image with a diagonal edge, will draw more focus from  your visitors than the same content with straight lines. Let us say that we do not  like the blue borders on JazzMeet's sponsor logos, as they don't really ﬁ t our color  scheme well.  We can attract our visitors' attention towards the sponsor logos, by altering the  borders to contain diagonal elements:  [ 131 ]   Adding Decorative Elements  Size This is po ssibly the most obvious way to draw attention to something in your wiki's  design—by making it larger. One of the reasons why the newspaper headings grab  your attention is that they are larger than the surrounding content.  Thus, making the sponsors' logos smaller, in this case half of the original size,  reduces their ability to be noticed by visitors to the JazzMeet wiki.  Indentation You can establish a visual hierarchy between your wiki's blocks of content through  the use of indentation and padding. Generally,  indentation is used to reduce the  importance of an element within a page. For example, in the table of contents, the  more indented a section's heading is, the less important it is.  In the table of contents just shown, indentation helps to make it clear that section 1.1   'Venue'  is more important than section 1.2.1.1.1  "More Details" .  [ 132 ]   Chapter 6  Padding Padding is t  he space between elements. We can also make use of the margin attribute  in CSS to achieve the same effect.   Padding and margin both refer to the space around an object. The difference is that  padding is a part of the object whereas margin is not.  For example, if we still wanted to draw attention to JazzMeet's sponsors, we could  have more space  "padding"  between the two sponsor logos:  The whitespace is striking. So many posters and print advertising campaigns,  especially for things such as perfumes and clothing, will contain only minimal  content and a lot of empty space, because it attracts attention.  However, in a web design, as opposed to a print design, too much whitespace  could annoy your visitors by spreading the information they need over a larger  portion of "screen real estate". This means that your visitors could have to do a lot of  unnecessary scrolling.  Do not over-do it: The trick with any of the above techniques is to use them sparingly. The  overuse of any one of them, or a combination of them, will result in your  visitors not knowing where to focus their attention.  [ 133 ]   Adding Decorative Elements  Order The order of  elements on a web page or any document will also have an affect on  the amount of attention your visitors pay to them. In most Western countries, where  we read from left to right, something at the top-left of a web page is much more  likely to attract our attention than something at the bottom-right.  Thus, website footers contain information that most of the visitors wouldn't be very  interested in, such as copyright details, and information on what powers the website   in our case, MediaWiki .  In the same way, let us say that one of our sponsors suddenly donates a lot of money  towards JazzMeet's hosting costs, and we want to reward them by giving them more  precedence in the sponsor section of our wiki.  We can re-order the sponsors' logos, so the sponsor who donated the most money or  resources to JazzMeet appears at the top of the sponsors list.     Depth and the Third Dimension Much like movement, our brains are designed to perceive depth; that is, we seem  programmed with an innate ability to see in three dimensions.  This is especially effective on the Internet and in print, as a web page  or a magazine  page  is two-dimensional. Adding a perceived third dimension to a web page can  greatly enhance its power to catch your visitors' attention.  [ 134 ]   Chapter 6  A good examp l e of the human brain being able to perceive 3D is  Ames' Window, available through Professor Richard Gregory's website,  at: http:  www.richardgregory.org experiments video  ames_window.htm.  A more recent and web-related depth example is the website for Silverback   http:  www.silverbackapp.com :  Interestingly, the vines are layered  using the z-index property in CSS and  transparent PNGs  to give the viewer a notion of depth. The closer the vines are  meant to be, the more blurred they are.  Whilst the co n cept of creating depth with multiple overlaying divs is  interesting, the same effect could quite easily be achieved by using a  single, repeating background image.  [ 135 ]   Adding Decorative Elements  In a similar way, we can attract JazzMeet visitors' focus to the sponsors' logos by  creating a sense of depth by using a 3D affect on each of the logo "boxes".  Focus-Lessening Techniques Lowering the vis  ual impact of some of your wiki's elements to give more precedence  to the others can be done in two ways.  Firstly, you can simply adjust the visual impact of the elements in your design using  the focus-drawing techniques that we discussed. This will place the more important  elements at a higher level of your wiki design's visual hierarchy.  For major changes in the focus of elements on your wiki, this probably  isn't suitable. As a result, you may want to reconsider your wiki's overall  layout and design.  [ 136 ]   Chapter 6  Secondly, you can use some other ideas for getting the attention of your wiki's  visitors. These are as follows:  lower contrast, both within the element, and in relation to the other elements smaller sizes, without making the element's content unreadable; it may be  possible to reduce its size, and, thus, the impact less indentation and padding  Summary In this   chapter we covered various decorative elements in websites, and their  application to your MediaWiki wiki. This included drawing the focus of the visitors  through the use of the following:                       Size Contrast Diagonal planes of vision Indentation Movement Depth  We also learnt that it is important to assign importance to our content and other  elements, as it adds to the hierarchy of your website's content.   [ 137 ]    Dynamic CSS and JavaScript  Many websites make use of JavaScript to help their visitors. JavaScript is a client-side  scripting language, which means that it runs on your visitors' computers, and not  your server. In other words, the elements of your wiki can be manipulated without  the wiki page being reloaded.   Less is more with JavaScript JavaScript is an excellent tool, but be careful to use it to enhance your  website. Also be sure that your wiki's primary functionality, which  includes being able to add, edit, and manipulate pages, is still easily done  for those visitors who do not have JavaScript enabled or installed.  In this chapter, we will cover integrating some JavaScript into the JazzMeet. This  includes the following:        Manipulating the edit page so that you can edit your wiki's content in a  "light box" Manipulating tables in your wiki through "Tablecloth"  Inline Edit Interface Some of JazzMeet's regular contributors may ﬁ nd it easier to have the edit interface  appear inline. We can achieve this by using JavaScript.   We have quite a few choices when it comes to providing a suitable solution for this  functionality. We will assess ThickBox, Lightbox 2, and GreyBox, all of which have  slightly different features and implementations.   Dynamic CSS and JavaScript  ThickBox   ThickBox  http:  jquery.com demo thickbox   is a JavaScript "widget" that  makes use of the jQuery library:  What does ThickBox Support? W e can use ThickBox with images, content within iframes, and AJAX-based content.  ThickBox also supports inline content  that is, content within the page that you  are linking, as seen in the following screenshot , although this is not of interest to us  in this application. Unlike Lightbox, ThickBox can also be used with Flash videos  and games.  [ 140 ]   Chapter 7  ThickBox's Features Th ickBox allows for its invocation from three elements: links, inputs  for example,  submit buttons , and image maps. It  will also automatically resize images that are  too big to ﬁ t comfortably within the viewer's browser window.  To invoke Thickbox, the triggering item, for example a link to another page, needs to  have been assigned a class of .thickbox.  The triggering class can be conﬁ gured in the ThickBox JavaScript ﬁ les. For  more details, refer to the ThickBox documentation.  As with GreyBox and Lightbox, ThickBox allows the "window" to be closed when the  user clicks the "close" button, or when the Escape key is pressed.  GreyBox Gr  eyBox  http:  www.orangoo.com labs GreyBox   has similar functionality  to ThickBox.  [ 141 ]   Dynamic CSS and JavaScript What does GreyBox Support? Gre yBox can be used to display single images, webpages, and webpage galleries.  GreyBox's Features Gre yBox is invoked by adding a rel attribute to the link to be used in conjunction  with it. GreyBox is more complex to use than Lightbox or Thickbox as the type of  pop-up that needs to be displayed has to be deﬁ ned within the rel attribute, as per  the documentation on the GreyBox website.  This, however, allows for greater ﬂ exibility, with galleries of images gaining a  navigation bar at the top of the screen:  [ 142 ]   Webs ites linked to GreyBox are displayed a bit differently by default, in a  browser-like window. For instance, look at the Google UK homepage in the  following screenshot:  Chapter 7  [ 143 ]   Dynamic CSS and JavaScript  Lightbox 2 Light  box 2  http:  www.lokeshdhakar.com projects lightbox2   is the work of  Lokesh Dhakar, and similar provides functionality to GreyBox and ThickBox, as its  focus is on being easy to install and use.  What does Lightbox Support? Lightbox has built-in transitions between images, although it does not support  iframes  well, at least not yet , or Flash ﬁ les, which GreyBox does.  [ 144 ]   Light box's Features Lightb ox has the ability to display both images and web pages:  Chapter 7  [ 145 ]   Dynamic CSS and JavaScript  Lightbo x also supports images in galleries:  Invocation of Lightbox, once it is installed, is achieved by adding a rel attribute to  the linked item, but in a much simpler fashion than GreyBox.  Lightbo x 2 Wins There ar e some CSS-based options for adding the ability to have content in your wiki  pop-up over the current page. However, these have patchy support across browsers,  and involve adding additional HTML to the page, unnecessarily bloating it.  On the basis of this, and given that Lightbox is used by an existing MediaWiki  extension, we will be using Lightbox 2 to pop up the edit interface for our visitors  to use.  [ 146 ]   Chapter 7  Installing Lightbox 2 There ar  e a few steps that need to be followed to install and conﬁ gure Lightbox 2   version 2.04 . They are as follows:           Downloading and publishing the relevant JavaScript ﬁ les to your own server Linking to these ﬁ les in your wiki's head section Appending the Lightbox CSS to your current MediaWiki skin CSS Making changes to your wiki's HTML to tell Lightbox where it is used  Script Files for Header There are currently three script ﬁ les that need to be included in your wiki's    section, using the HTML below:     <script type="text javascript" src="js scriptaculous.js?load=effects,b uilder">      You will then need to ﬁ nd these ﬁ les on the Lightbox 2 website  http:  www. lokeshdhakar.com projects lightbox2  , and upload them to your wiki's  hosting account.  Be sure  to change the paths of the JavaScript ﬁ les  highlighted above  to  their location on your server.  Lightbox CSS You will  require CSS to style the way the pop-up appears. This stylesheet is available  on the Lightbox 2 website. You can do one of the three things with the Lightbox CSS:         Appen d it to your wiki's existing skin CSS ﬁ le Import it from your existing wiki's CSS ﬁ le Link to it as a separate ﬁ le in your wiki's head section  If you append it to your wiki's existing CSS ﬁ le, it can bloat your existing style,  and make it harder to read. On the other hand, importing the stylesheet from  your existing stylesheet or linking to it as a separate stylesheet  using the <style  type="text css">    means that the  browser has to make another HTTP request to the server. This could increase the  loading time for your wiki.  [ 147 ]   Dynamic CSS and JavaScript  The latter two options—of importing the style in another stylesheet, and importing  it separately within your wiki's header—are among the better options if you want  to make use of Lightbox  or any of its equivalents  in the other MediaWiki skins  available to your wiki's visitors  such as MonoBook .  Let's as sume that we will not have to work with the CSS for JazzMeet in any  signiﬁ cant way. Once we have ﬁ nished the JazzMeet skin, we will opt for appending  the Lightbox style to our existing style for JazzMeet.  rel="lightbox" The ﬁ na l step in using Lightbox is to add the attribute rel='lightbox' to the  link tag:   Example.com   After adding the relevant rel attribute, we have the following:   Example.com   Because MediaWiki dynamically inserts the page view options such as "edit",  "history", and "talk" into the page from an array, we need to insert a bit of PHP into  the JazzMeet.php skin template ﬁ le, to check if the link being inserted is the "edit  page" link.  Identifying the "edit" link Firstly,  we identify the section of the MediaWiki template that inserts the "Views"  option links in the page. This starts with  data['content_ actions'] as $key => $tab  { ?>.  The code that needs to be inserted is highlighted below, and consists of an "if"  statement to check the "key" value of the array. If this is "edit"  that is, this is the "edit  page" link , then we insert the code rel='lightbox' in the link tag.  {    " <?php if $tab['class']     ?> class=" " <?php  } ?> > "   [ 148 ]   Chapter 7  if  $key == 'edit'    <?php    { ?>  rel="lightbox" <?php }?>  tooltipAndAccesskey 'ca-'.$key  ?>><?php echo htmlspecialchars $tab['text']  ?>      You should now be able to edit a page in the JazzMeet wiki in a Lightbox window.  Because the edit page is quite a large ﬁ le, it will probably take more time to load.  This, in turn should cause the display of a "loading" animation while you  are waiting.  [ 149 ]   Dynamic CSS and JavaScript  Once the  page has been loaded, the white content container should expand to  a width suitable for the edit interface. As the full edit page is loaded, the  navigation and header areas are also loaded and displayed  but not shown in the  screenshot below :  Customizing Lightbox 2 There are  quite a few aspects of Lightbox that can be changed, including  the following:           The images, such as the loading graphic and the close button The CSS relevant to the Lightbox The level of transparency The caption text  [ 150 ]   Changing Lightbox Graphics To give th e loading graphic a more JazzMeet-themed look, we can use an animation  of musical notes:  Chapter 7  For example, instead of just the words "loading, please wait" your visitors will be  expecting some sort of animation to inform them that the requested content is still  being loaded. You can use non-animated graphics as the loading graphic too.  The other  images you can alter are the "next" and "previous" button graphics, and the  "close" button. These are easily found in the Lightbox 2 download package.  Changing Lightbox CSS The CSS for  Lightbox is quite compact. A few CSS ids and classes are deﬁ ned within  it, including the following:              overlay ﬁ lls the screen with a semi-transparent effect when the Lightbox  is activated. lightbox is the container for the image or ﬁ le in Lightbox. lightboxImage is the image or ﬁ le in Lightbox itself. imageDataContainer contains the "next", "previous" and "close" buttons. It  also contains the image or ﬁ le caption.  [ 151 ]   Dynamic CSS and JavaScript  For better compatibility of Lightbox with JazzMeet, we can change the background  color of the overlay to dark brown  rather than the default black :  overlay{  position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; z-index: 90; width: 100%; height: 500px; background-color: 38230C; }   Changing Lightbox Captions With Lightb ox 2, you can group the Lightbox contents together in the  following manner:   Item 1   Item 2   When a gallery of images is displayed using Lightbox in the way just mentioned,  Lightbox will insert a caption, for example, "Image 2 of 4", beneath the image. You  can alter the text of this caption by altering the labelImage and labelOf variables in  the lightbox.js ﬁ le. The default settings are shown here:  If we want to internationalize JazzMeet, we need to translate this to Italian. For  example, "Image 1 of 3" would read "l'immagine 1 di 3".  labelImage: "Image", labelOf: "of"  labelImage: "l'immagine", labelOf: "di"  LightboxThumbs We can also use a functionality provided by LightBox to allow thumbnail images  within our wiki to be opened within the page.  [ 152 ]   Lightbox 2 comes to our rescue here yet again, alongside the LightboxThumbs  MediaWiki extension  http:  ww w.mediawiki.org wiki Extension: LightboxThumbs .  Chapter 7     Installing LightboxThumbs Installing L ightboxThumbs is quite simple. You need to follow these steps:           Save th e LightboxThumbs.php ﬁ le in the extensions directory of your  MediaWiki installation. The ﬁ le is provided on the Extensions page on  MediaWiki.org. Inform MediaWiki that you are expecting the LightboxThumbs extension  to be present by adding the code requires_once "$IP extensions  LightboxThumbs.php"  to your LocalSettings.php ﬁ le. Install Lightbox.  [ 153 ]   Dynamic CSS and JavaScript  The Result We should no w be able to see a larger version of images and photographs uploaded  on our wiki when we click on the thumbnail version of images embedded within our  wiki's content:  Tables: Making Data easier to read As JazzMeet will be organising jazz gigs and events around the world in  MediaWiki's collaborative environment, we will have a lot of HTML tables of data.  These may include details such as who is organizing what and who is attending.  In large tables, it can be easy to lose focus of the row or column that you were  looking at, but we can use JavaScript scripts such as Tablecloth to enhance the  visitors' experiences.   [ 154 ]   Tablecloth  h  ttp:  cssglobe.com lab tablecloth   is a JavaScript-based feature  that highlight the row and column of a table that you are currently hovering over.  Chapter 7  The script also assigns a class of .odd to the odd rows in the table, and .even to the  even rows in the table.   Installing Ta  blecloth The Tablecloth  script needs to be installed in a way similar to Lightbox 2, that is, by  linking to the JavaScript ﬁ les in your wiki template's   section, and by adding  the Tablecloth CSS to your existing CSS.  To link to th e JavaScript ﬁ les, you will need to add the following lines in the    section of your wiki  assuming that the Tablecloth JavaScript ﬁ le is in the  skins tc  directory :      [ 155 ]   Dynamic CSS and JavaScript  You will also need to include the Tablecloth CSS, either by linking to it in the head of  the document, or by appending it to the existing CSS for your MediaWiki template.  For the same reasons discussed earlier, we will simply append the Tablecloth CSS to  our existing JazzMeet CSS ﬁ le, in skins jazzmeet main.css.  Customizing Tablecloth We can customi ze Tablecloth's CSS in order to match JazzMeet's color scheme  red,  beige, and brown . Tablecloth deﬁ nes a number of styles that allow you to customize  the way tables are displayed on your website. These include the following:            .selected is applied to the table cell that is currently selected  try clicking a  table cell . .empty  affects empty table cells. .over is used to identify the cells that are currently being hovered over. .odd and .even are used to distinguish between the odd and even rows in  the table.  Tablecloth was designed to work on websites that use HTML tables for  tabular data only. However, by default, MediaWiki's table of contents   toc  uses a table, so Tablecloth will affect its styling too.  We need to rem ove the styling that is provided by Tablecloth, as the JazzMeet  skin already deﬁ nes it. In particular, we need to remove the "width: 100%" that  Tablecloth applies to the table element, as this will cause the table of contents to  stretch to the full width of the content area of the JazzMeet design.  The Result: Highlighted Tables The tables will now reﬂ  ect our color scheme, and will be highlighted when the  visitors with JavaScript enabled hover over the cells. As you can see, only the  horizontal cells, and not the vertical cells, are highlighted.  [ 156 ]   In the example below, the table cell with "Danielle"  is highlighted as its content  is the one being hovered over, and the "Drink" and "User:Richard" cells are also  highlighted, but less so than the cell being hovered over. Refer to the following  screenshot:  Chapter 7  Summary In this chapter, we covered the following:          Various implementations of the popular JavaScript pop-ups such as  ThickBox and GreyBox Using Lightbox to help your wiki ﬂ ow better for your visitors Using Tablecloth for tabular data, to help highlight your visitors' focus in  large amounts of data  We also covered topics that ensure we're not needlessly adding features that rely on  JavaScript to the detriment of our wiki's visitors who do not have JavaScript enabled  or installed.  With JavaScript libraries such as jQuery and script.aculo.us, adding new features  and enhancing your wiki is quite easy.   [ 157 ]    Social Networking and  MediaWiki  The MediaWiki skin for JazzMeet seems good, but we can still add certain things to  our wiki to make it stand out. In this chapter, we will discuss the following:         Integrating Twitter feeds in to your wiki's template Embedding and styling YouTube videos in your wiki Using social bookmarking services such as Furl and Facebook  Integrating Twitter with MediaWiki   Twitter  http:  www.twitter.com  is a micro-blogging service that allows users to  convey the world  or at least the small portion of it on Twitter  what they are doing,  in messages of 140 characters or less.   Social Networking and MediaWiki  It is possible to embed these messages in external websites, which is what we will be  doing for JazzMeet. We can use the updates to inform our wiki's visitors of the latest  JazzMeet being held across the world, and they can send a response to the JazzMeet  Twitter account.     Shorter Links  Because Twitter only allows posts of up to 140 characters, many Twitter users  make use of URL-shortening services such as Tiny URL  http:  tinyurl.com ,  and notlong  http:  notlong.com  to turn long web addresses into short, more  manageable URLs. Tiny URL assigns a random URL such as http:  tinyurl. com 3ut9p4, while notlong allows you to pick a free sub-domain to redirect to your  chosen address, such as http:  asgkasdgadg.notlong.com.  Twitter automatically shortens web addresses in your posts.  [ 160 ]   Creating a Twitter Account C reating a Twitter account is quite easy. Just ﬁ ll in the username, password, and  email address ﬁ elds, and submit the registration form, once you have read and  accepted the terms and conditions. If your chosen username is free, your account is  created instantly.  Chapter 8  [ 161 ]   Social Networking and MediaWiki  Once your account has been created, you can change the settings such as your display  name and your proﬁ le's background image, to help blur the distinction between  your website and your Twitter proﬁ le. Colors can be speciﬁ ed as "hex" values  under  the Design tab of your Twitter account's settings section. The following color codes  change the link colors to our JazzMeet's palette of browns and reds:      [ 162 ]   As you can see in the screenshot, JazzMeet's Twitter proﬁ le now looks a little more  like the JazzMeet wiki. By doing this, the visitors catching up with JazzMeet's events  on Twitter will not be confused by a sudden change in color scheme:  Chapter 8     Embedding Twitter Feeds in MediaWiki Twit ter provides a few ways to embed your latest posts in to your own website s ;  simply log in and go to http:  www.twitter.com badges.        Flash: With this option you can show just your posts, or your posts and your  friends' most recent posts on Twitter. HTML and JavaScript: You can conﬁ gure the code to show between 1 and 20  of your most recent Twitter posts.  As JazzMeet isn't really the sort of wiki the visitors would expect to ﬁ nd on Flash, we  will be using the HTML and JavaScript version. You are provided with the necessary  code to embed in your website or wiki. We will add it to the JazzMeet skin template,  as we want it to be displayed on every page of our wiki, just beneath our sponsor  links. Refer to the following code:     Twitter Updates        <script type="text javascript" src="http:  twitter.com javascripts  blogger.js">  <script type="text javascript" src="http:  twitter.com statuses user_ timeline jazzmeet.json?callback=twitterCallback2&count=5">   [ 163 ]   Social Networking and MediaWiki  The JavaScript given at the bottom of the code can be moved just above the    tag of your wiki's skin template. This will help your wiki to load other important  elements of your wiki before the Twitter status.  You will need to replace "jazzmeet" in the code with your own Twitter  username, otherwise you will receive JazzMeet's Twitter updates, and not  your own.  It is important to leave the unordered list of ID twitter_update_list as it is, as this  is the element the JavaScript code looks for to insert a list item containing each of  your twitter messages in the page.   Sty ling Twitter's HTML We n eed to style the Twitter HTML by adding some CSS to change the colors and  style of the Twitter status code:  twitter_div { background: FFF; border: 3px BEB798 solid; color: BEB798; margin: 0; padding: 5px; width: 165px; } twitter_div a { color: 8D1425 !important; } ultwitter_update_list { list-style-type: none; margin: 0; padding: 0; } twitter_update_list li { color: 38230C; display: block; } h2.twitter-title { color: BEB798; font-size: 100%; }  [ 164 ]   Chapter 8  Ther e are only a few CSS IDs and classes that need to be taken care of. They are  as follows:          twitter_div is the element that contains the Twitter feeds. twitter_update_list is the ID applied to the unordered list. Styling this  affects how your Twitter feeds are displayed. .twitter-title is the class applied to the Twitter feed's   heading   which you can remove, if necessary .  Our wiki's skin for JazzMeet now has JazzMeet's Twitter feed embedded in the right- hand column, allowing visitors to keep up-to-date with the latest JazzMeet news.  Inserting Twitter as Page Content Media Wiki does not allow JavaScript to be embedded in a page via the "edit"  function, so you won't be able to insert a Twitter status feed directly in a page unless  it is in the template itself. Even if you inserted the relevant JavaScript links into your  MediaWiki skin template, they are relevant only for one Twitter proﬁ le  "jazzmeet",  in our case .  [ 165 ]   Social Networking and MediaWiki  YouTube in MediaWiki YouTu  be  http:  youtube.com  is a video sharing website that allows registered  users to upload videos, and allows visitors to watch streamed videos that are  categorized by tags. A feature useful to JazzMeet is that the videos can be embedded  in external websites, by inserting the code provided on the video's page in to your  own website. The code looks similar to the following example:   <param name="movie" value="http:   www.youtube.com v U4FAKRpUCYY&hl=en"> <param name="wmode"  value="transparent"> <embed src="http:  www.youtube. com v U4FAKRpUCYY&hl=en" type="application x-shockwave-flash"  wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355">     This isn't particularly useful for MediaWiki, though, since you don't  generally  want  videos in the template itself, but in the content area, where the HTML is presented as  text within the document:  MediaWiki Extension: VideoFlash We can  overcome this problem with the use of an extension for MediaWiki called  VideoFlash  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:VideoFlash .  VideoFlash allows videos from a number of popular video websites, including  YouTube and Google Video, to be embedded in your MediaWiki wiki with  relative ease.  [ 166 ]   Chapter 8  Insta lling VideoFlash The in structions for installing VideoFlash are included on the website, but we will  go through installing them on our JazzMeet wiki for clarity. Firstly, you will need to  create a ﬁ le called videoflash.php in the extensions directory of your MediaWiki  installation. You should copy and paste the code provided in the extension's page on  MediaWiki's website into this ﬁ le. Secondly, you will need to add a line of code at the end of your  LocalSettings.php ﬁ le, which is usually located in your MediaWiki's installation's  root directory. If MediaWiki is installed at http:  www.example.com wiki , you  should be able to ﬁ nd LocalSettings.php at http:  www.example.com wiki  LocalSettings.php. The earlier versions of MediaWiki close the ﬁ le with ?>: the  require_once statement below needs to be above this "end of ﬁ le" marker:  require_once "extensions videoflash.php" ;  This tells MediaWiki that you have installed the VideoFlash extension, and helps you  to ﬁ nd the relevant ﬁ le.  Embedding YouTube Videos in Page Content If any  visitor wants to embed the video located at http:  www.youtube.com  watch?v=U4FAKRpUCYY, they can now do so by inserting the following wiki-markup  in  a MediaWiki page on the JazzMeet wiki:   U4FAKRpUCYY   The page should now display the relevant YouTube video.  [ 167 ]   Social Networking and MediaWiki  Embedding Videos from other Video  Providers Google  videos can be embedded with a similar code once the VideoFlash MediaWiki  extension has been installed:   U4FAKRpUCYY   Telling your Visitors It is t rue that videos can be embedded into your wiki, but your visitors need to  know that they can be embedded. There are two ways of conveying this information  to your visitors. Either display the Help:Editing page, which is linked to the edit  interface, or edit the text of the edit interface to inform your wiki's visitors that the  ability to add videos from services such as YouTube is available.  The edit interface's text is similar to the one shown here:  To alter the text in the edit interface, go to MediaWiki:Copyrightwarning or  MediaWiki:Copyrightwarning2. This text is displayed directly above the edit  summary box and the submission button for the edit. We will add the following  HTML to MediaWiki:Copyrightwarning2 to tell our visitors that they can  embed videos:   Add Videos to JazzMeet!  You can now add videos to JazzMeet using the following code:    YouTube video ID    Videos from Google Video can be added with the following code:    Google video ID    For more information, see [[Help:Adding videos to JazzMeet]].  [ 168 ]   This ch anges the message in the edit interface of our JazzMeet wiki to:  Chapter 8  Social Bookmarking Social bo okmarking allows people to "bookmark", or make a note of, the websites  they like or ﬁ nd useful, and share these bookmarks with other social bookmarkers  while surﬁ ng the Internet.  Traditionally, bookmarking was done through the Internet browsing software,  such as Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, or Opera. With social bookmarking, your  bookmarks are not conﬁ ned to one browser, but are stored online.  The following two options are available for enabling social bookmarking on  your website:       Link t o each individual social bookmarking service that you wish to use Use a social bookmarking aggregator such as Socializer or AddThis  Even if you do not have links to allow visitors to bookmark your website,  many services allow their users to install toolbars in their browser, which  allows your website to be added anyway. Adding these links will help to  spread your wiki and its new skin very fast.  [ 169 ]   Social Networking and MediaWiki  Individual Social Bookmarking Services There are huge numbers of social bookmarking services on the Internet, and quite a  number of these have become reasonably popular. We will look at some of the more  popular bookmarking services such as:          Mister  Wong Furl Facebook  Your Wiki's Audience One thing  to consider before adding social bookmarking service links to your wiki  is your audience. For instance, if your wiki is technology-related, you may ﬁ nd it  better to use Digg than Facebook, as Digg is more popular than Facebook for your  wiki's intended audience. If your wiki's visitors are primarily from Germany, you  may ﬁ nd Mister Wong more useful than Furl, because Mister Wong is more popular  with the German users. There are many other social bookmarking services available, including Del.icio. us  http:  del.icio.us  and StumbleUpon  http:  stumbleupon.com , which  you can use after asking your wiki's visitors by means of a poll, or following  simple experimentation. Example of Audience durhamStu dent  http:  durhamStudent.co.uk  is a niche website aimed at  students of Durham University in the UK:  [ 170 ]   The durhamStudent website uses both the methods of social bookmarking discussed  earlier, providing links for eKstreme's Socializer and a link to an individual  bookmarking service, Facebook:  Chapter 8  Facebook wa s linked individually here because it is incredibly popular among  the students at Durham University  indeed, the Durham network is only open to  those with a university email address . Although Facebook's bookmarking service  is accessible through Socializer, it is also linked separately as the website's target  audience is more likely to use that service than any other. Mister Wong Mister Wong  , http:  www.mister-wong.com, is popular with German and other  European users  though not so much in Great Britain , and allows the users to store  their bookmarks while maintaining their privacy, with the ability to set bookmarks  as "public" or "private".  [ 171 ]   Social Networking and MediaWiki  Generally, the social bookmarking services ask for two pieces of information when  creating a link from your website to them: the URL  address  of the page or website  you want to add, and the title of that page or website, as you wish it to be posted.  Linking to Mister Wong To link to M ister Wong, create a link where you want your social bookmark to be  shown in your MediaWiki template in the following format:  http:  www.mister-wong.com index.php?action=addurl&bm_url=www.example. com &bm_description=Your+Website  Spaces are automatically escaped with a "+" sign by the majority of social  bookmarking services. You don't have to worry about properly escaping  spaces in the title of your link when linking to bookmarking services.  To use these services with MediaWiki, we will be required to use some PHP that we   covered in Chapter 5. In particular, we will need the following:        The page' s title, which we can get with   text 'pagetitle'  ?> The website's address, retrievable with   urlencode 'serverurl'  ?>  For simplicity, we will assume that our visitors will always want to bookmark  JazzMeet's homepage, http:  www.jazzmeet.com. Thus, the code in our MediaWiki  template would appear as follows:  <a href= "http:  www.mister-wong.com index.php?action=addurl&bm_ url=www.jazzmeet.com &bm_description=JazzMeet" title="Bookmark  JazzMeet with Mister Wong">Bookmark JazzMeet with Mister Wong   What Mister Wong Users See If a visitor  to your wiki decides to bookmark your wiki with Mister Wong, they will  be greeted with a screen similar to the following, with ﬁ elds for the address of the  website  URL , title, related keywords  "tags" , and a comment about the website:   [ 172 ]   Chapter 8  They are also given the option to bookmark as either "public", allowing other Mister  Wong users to see it, or "private", which restricts the bookmarked website to their  account only.  Furl Furl, h ttp:   www.furl.net, has functionality that is similar to Mister Wong.  [ 173 ]   Social Networking and MediaWiki Linking to Furl Very similar t o Mister Wong, you can create a link to bookmark a particular page  in MediaWiki by inserting the following in to your skin template:  <a href= "http:  www.furl.net storeIt.jsp?t=JazzMeet&u=www.jazzmeet. com" title="Bookmark JazzMeet with Furl">Bookmark JazzMeet with Furl<  a>  What Furl Users See Furl has the s ame features as Mister Wong. But the Furl team has added its own  twist to social bookmarking, with the added features of being able to add a rating   out of ﬁ ve stars , marking the bookmark as "read" or "unread", and creating  "groups" to better organize your bookmarked websites:  This information is provided by the user, so you don't need to specify any more  parameters in addition to the page title and your wiki's address.  [ 174 ]   Facebook Facebook  http:    facebook.com  is a very popular social networking site that  allows people to share photographs with each other. In 2006, Facebook launched its  social bookmarking feature.  Chapter 8  Linking to Facebook To link to Faceb ook's social bookmarking service, we can use the following code:  <a href= " http:  www.facebook.com sharer.php?u=http:  www.jazzmeet. com" title="Bookmark JazzMeet with Facebook">Bookmark JazzMeet with  Facebook   Note that we do not need to specify the page's title, as Facebook will automatically  insert this, along with an  optional  image and a brief description of your website.  [ 175 ]   Social Networking and MediaWiki What Facebook Users See Facebook's sharing  features are a lot more limited than other social bookmarking  services. The user is given an option to change the title or the address being  bookmarked, and write a short description of the website:  Once posted, the  link is visible in the poster's feed:  Social Bookmarking Aggregators Rather than attemp  ting to put every single social bookmarking site link in your  MediaWiki skin template, there is a simpler way. We can use a social bookmark  aggregator such as eKstreme's Socializer, or AddThis.  [ 176 ]   AddThis AddThis  http:  ad  dthis.com  is the "number one bookmarking and  sharing button".  Chapter 8  Linking to AddThis Linking to AddThis  is easy as there is a wizard-style, step-by-step guide for creating  and customizing your button. AddThis gives you a number of choices as to how it  looks and acts for your wiki's visitors. Firstly, it can be used as a single button:  [ 177 ]   Social Networking and MediaWiki  Secondly, a "drop-down" version with JavaScript can be used, which provides an  instant access to the more popular bookmarking services:  You may need to register for an "AddThis" account to gain access to the  code that will be required.  Socializer ekStreme' s Socializer    http:  ekstreme.com socializer  is another social  bookmark service aggregator.  [ 178 ]   Unlike AddThis, Social  izer does not have a drop-down "widget", so to use it you can  just link to it as you would do in any other website.  Chapter 8  New Windows You can create a new browser window by adding target="_blank"  to the relevant link attribute. You could use this to prevent your wiki's  visitors from losing their place on your wiki when they bookmark it. But  it may irritate some visitors who are accustomed to opening a new tab in  their browser by using the central mouse button.  Linking to Socializer  Linking to Socializer is similar to linking to Mister Wong or Furl's social  bookmarking services.  <a href= "http:  ekstreme.com socializer ?url=www.jazzmeet. com&title=JazzMeet" title="Bookmark JazzMeet with Socializer">Bookmark  JazzMeet with Socializer    What Socializer Users See  Socializer users are presented with a list of bookmarking services, with a more  popular group towards the top of the screen:  [ 179 ]   Social Networking and MediaWiki  Social bookmarking for JazzMeet A  s JazzMeet's visitors are likely to be from a wide range of backgrounds, we will use  eKstreme's Socializer for JazzMeet's social bookmarking.  Insert the XHTML given earlier in JazzMeet's skin template, below the article's  content, aligned to the right:      Summary We have covered embedding links to social networking sites and more interactive  elements in your website, including the following:          Videos from YouTube, Google Video, and other popular video  sharing websites Twitter feeds Social bookmarks  Although adding these more interactive features to your wiki can be a good thing,  remember that they should only be used to enhance your wiki, and not as its primary  focus. Without useful content, your wiki's visitors will leave your wiki and not add  anything to the community that you are trying to create.  [ 180 ]   Deploying Your  MediaWiki Skin  In the previous chapters, we have covered the topics that helped us in making our  MediaWiki skin ready to deploy across the wiki. You can not use use your new  skin on the wiki, but can also share your creation with members of the MediaWiki  community. In this chapter, we will cover the following:         The licensing options you could use with your skin Packaging your MediaWiki skin for use by others Deploying your skin on your own wiki  Deploying on your Own Wiki  We have brieﬂ y covered how to deploy your MediaWiki skin across your wiki  in Chapter 2. But even if you used your wiki's new skin as your user account's  preferred skin, you can still change the the wiki's settings so that all of your wiki's  visitors will be able to use it. Simply set $wgDefaultSkin variable in the LocalSettings.php ﬁ le to the name  of your skin. To make the JazzMeet skin as the default skin for your wiki, replace  $wgDefaultSkin = 'monobook' with $wgDefaultSkin = 'jazzmeet'. Remember  to upload the ﬁ le to its original location once you have replaced it.  Packaging Your MediaWiki Skin  If you want to share your MediaWiki skin with the MediaWiki community, you  can package it for a general use and post it to Wikimedia in the user styles gallery   http:  meta.wikimedia.org wiki Gallery_of_user_styles .   Deploying Your MediaWiki Skin  What Needs to be Included  You will need to include the contents of your skin's directory, including the  main.css ﬁ le and any images in it. For the JazzMeet skin, all of these will be in the  skins jazzmeet  directory of your wiki's installation directory.    Additionally, you should include the PHP template ﬁ le associated with your new skin.  For JazzMeet, this is located in the skins  directory, and is called JazzMeet.php.  Do remember to include the print stylesheet, and any changes you  have made to it. This is available in skins common , and is called  commonPrint.css.  If you made any changes to the LocalSettings.php ﬁ le, you may want to include  that in your skin's package, as well. Do not worry about doing this if you have only  made changes to the skin name, as we can get help on Wikimedia's website for  setting a new skin as the default skin.  [ 182 ]   Chapter 9  It is also better to mention any other ﬁ les that have been changed, and the elements  that have been hidden from the default MediaWiki layout, such as the toolbox or  the personal navigation bar. This helps MediaWiki users who may want to  use your  skin understand how it differs from the traditional MediaWiki skins, and to know  whether any changes need to be made to your skin for their use.    README File I t is traditional to include a README.txt ﬁ le in your wiki skin's package to provide  information about yourself, such as your contact name, or for feedback, and  bug reports. You can also mention the browsers in which you have tested your  MediaWiki skin.  It is useful if you have tested it in the most recent versions, for  example, of Internet Explorer and Firefox.   It is also useful to mention the version of  MediaWiki that you were using while designing your skin.  O ur JazzMeet skin's README ﬁ le may appear as follows:  ===========================  JazzMeet Skin, version 1.25  ===========================  September 2008.  R.W.E. Carter of Peacock Carter for Packt Publishing -- England, United Kingdom -- jazzmeet.wiki@googlemail.com  This work is released under the Creative Commons 'Attribution-Non- Commercial-No Derivative Works' License.  Please contact me with any bugs you may find, and if you manage to fix  one, I'd be grateful to know about it!  Geekery ======= Tested in Firefox 2.0, Internet Explorer 6 and 7 and Opera 9.26.  Designed using MediaWiki 1.11.0.  Using This Skin =============== To use this skin, copy all of the images and the CSS  style  files   included in the jazzmeet  directory  to the skins directory of your  MediaWiki installation. Copy the JazzMeet.php file in to the skins  directory too. All you need to do now is to change the $wgDefaultSkins parameter in  your LocalSettings.php file to jazzmeet, and upload it back to your  server, and you're good to go! Deviations  [ 183 ]   Deploying Your MediaWiki Skin  ========== The JazzMeet skin differs from MonoBook, with deviations including: The left hand column is right-aligned, and designed to hold adverts The majority of the navigation links have been hidden or removed, as  the skin uses static links in the menu Some links in the footer are hidden or removed  Known Bugs ========== - None at present  The following information is very useful and can be included in your MediaWiki  skin's README ﬁ le:                     Your name  or alias  Your contact details that are useful for others to report bugs or suggest  improvements to you The date of your skin's release The version of MediaWiki with which you used your skin can be found on  the Special:Version page of your wiki. A "changelog", which is a list of any changes that you have made to the skin  since releasing it Major deviations from the more popular MediaWiki skins The browsers with which you have tested your skins  You  don't have to provide any of this information, but doing so helps others who  may want to use your MediaWiki skin, and providing these details is in the spirit of  MediaWiki of collaborating with others.  Formats and Compression T o make the download of your MediaWiki skin faster, you could compress it using a  common format such as ZIP  .zip  and Tar  .tar . This is especially useful if your skin  uses large images such as photographic background images.  Tar Compression T he latter of these formats, the UNIX-based "Tar", is used by Wikimedia to  package the MediaWiki download, and is usually compressed again  using GZIP   http:  www.gzip.org  to form a .tar.gz ﬁ le:  [ 184 ]   Chapter 9     This is because Tar simply concatenates  joins  multiple ﬁ les together, creating what  is known as a "Tarball", which is not compressed.  You can ﬁ nd a tutorial on using Tars at http:  www.cs.duke.edu  ~ola courses programming tar.html.  ZIP Compression Th ere are many programs to deal with Windows-based ZIP compression, including  7-Zip  http:  www.7-zip.org , WinZip  http:  www.winzip.com , and  PowerArchiver  http:  www.powerarchiver.com .  ZIP in Windows More recent versions of Windows include the ability to "zip" and "unzip"  ﬁ les – just right-click and select New  Compressed  zipped  folder.   L icensing Options Yo u might have spent considerable time skinning MediaWiki. It is, therefore,  important to know your options when releasing your skin for others, and the ways  in which you can restrict your skin's use by commercial entities.  [ 185 ]   Deploying Your MediaWiki Skin  Usual Licensing and Copyright By   default, all of the graphics that you have created for your wiki will be in your  copyright; they are your intellectual property. In the United Kingdom and other  members of the European Union, this lasts until 70 years after your death, thanks  to "Directive 2006 116 EC" and the consequent legislation. 70 years holds for the  United States too, although there are some cases  for example, anonymous work   where the copyright expires after 95 years.  If your MediaWiki skin is based on the elements of others' work be aware  that, depending on the license they released it under, you may have  agreed to release your efforts under the same license.  Creative Commons Cr eative Commons  http:  creativecommons.org  has a range of licenses under  which your MediaWiki skin can be released:  [ 186 ]   Chapter 9  Cre ative Commons licenses are designed to be less restrictive than traditional  copyright. For example, Creative Commons allows for alterations to be made to your  MediaWiki skin as long as it is released under the same license.  Parts of Creative Commons License Cre ative Commons licenses have the following three parts:         The Commons deeds The legal code The digital code Commons Deeds The  Commons deeds are a summary of the license that uses plain, simple language  to describe the basic concepts of the license.  Legal Code The  legal code is the full license that legally binds any users of your MediaWiki skin,  should you choose to distribute your skin under the license.  Digital Code The  digital code is the machine-readable version of the license, intended to be used  by search engines to help identify the results that have a particular license, and  results are without certain restrictions.  Attribution License Wit h the Creative Commons Attribution license, others are free to modify and  distribute your work as long as they acknowledge the original author  s , and  provide the subject material to the same license.  [ 187 ]   Deploying Your MediaWiki Skin  The Commons deeds of the Attribution license for people in the UK  England and  Wales  will look similar to the following one:  Note the British ﬂ ag at the top right of  the screen.   Attribution-Non-Commercial License The  Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial license is similar to the  Attribution license, but requires that the work is used for non-commercial purposes  only. This license may be ideal for your MediaWiki skin if you want to release it for  use by others, as long as they do not beneﬁ t from it ﬁ nancially.  [ 188 ]   England and Wales' Commons deeds for the Creative Commons Attribution-non- Commercial license looks like this:  Chapter 9  Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivative Works  License The A ttribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivative Works license follows the  Attribution-Non-Commercial license. It allows the use of your wiki's skin, as long  as it is not for commercial use, and that the others do not create work based on your  MediaWiki skin. The author must be attributed, too.  [ 189 ]   Deploying Your MediaWiki Skin  The Commons deed for this license, applicable to those in England and Wales, shows  more restrictions on your skin's use than the previous licenses:  Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share Alike License The At tribution-Non-Commercial-Share Alike license from the Creative Commons  allows your MediaWiki skin to be used and distributed by others, although the  original author  you  gets credit for the work, and the work cannot be used for  commercial purposes.  [ 190 ]   The twist with this license is that should anyone build upon or transform your work,  they must release their work under the same license, as the Commons deeds shows:  Chapter 9  [ 191 ]   Deploying Your MediaWiki Skin Attribution-No Derivative Works License Creativ e Common's Attribution-No Derivative Works license allows others to use  your MediaWiki skin, as long as they do not create any work based upon your skin,  and credit you as the author of the work:  [ 192 ]   Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 License The Attr ibution-Share Alike license allows derivative works to be made from your  MediaWiki skin, as long as you are attributed as its original author and any material  based upon your work is released under the same license:  Chapter 9  [ 193 ]   Deploying Your MediaWiki Skin  As this E ngland and Wales version of the Commons deed shows, it is approved for  "free cultural works" by Freedom Deﬁ ned  http:  freedomdefined.org :  Freedom Deﬁ ned is working on creating deﬁ nitions of "free cultural works", and in  creating guidelines as to whether a work or a license can be considered "free".  License c omparison Freedom Deﬁ ned has a matrix of various licenses and their restrictions. It  is available at: http:  freedomdefined.org Licenses.  Understand the License Though we  have seen a summary of each of the Creative Commons licenses, you  should read the full text of the license before licensing your work under it, to prevent  misunderstandings in the future.  Waiving the Restrictions You are fr ee to waive these restrictions to anyone at any time, which is explained  towards the bottom of the Commons deeds.  [ 194 ]   GNU Licenses The GNU li  censes are based upon the licenses written by Richard Stallman for the  GNU operating system, and work around the concept of "copyleft"  http:  www. gnu.org copyleft  . Copyleft a llows everyone, including companies and other  proﬁ table organizations, to use and make changes to the materials under the license,  so long as they share what they change with the rest of the community.  Chapter 9  The GNU General Public License  GPL   http:  www.gnu.org copyleft gpl. html  was written for the use of the institutions and individuals who were not  connected with GNU. The GPL would allow others to use your MediaWiki skin so  long as any derived work is made available under the same terms.  The GNU Le  sser General Public License  LGPL     http:  www.gnu.org copyleft  lgpl.html  is similar   to the GPL, but allows the linking of other proprietary or free  software or existing work within it. This will prove useful when you have used the  work of others in your new MediaWiki skin.  [ 195 ]   Deploying Your MediaWiki Skin  Summary In this chapter, we have covered deploying your MediaWiki skin and packaging it  for the use by others. In particular, we have covered the following:       Packaging your MediaWiki skin for others to use Options for licensing your MediaWiki skin for others to use:       Creative Commons The GNU licenses, GPL and LGPL  [ 196 ]   MediaWiki Print Styles  The techniques we have encountered so far for skinning MediaWiki have only  applied to the "screen" version of your wiki. In this chapter, we will go through  the following:         The current commonPrint.css print stylesheet Creating a print stylesheet for your MediaWiki Introducing useful CSS elements for the print stylesheet  Viewing the Printable Version of  Your Page  The printable version of each page  minus "special" pages such as Special:Login   is linked to from each page using links within the "Tools" menu by default, which  is identiﬁ able in CSS with t-print. In most modern browsers  such as Internet  Explorer 7, Firefox, and Opera 9 , if a visitor selects the "print preview" option, the  print stylesheet will be used by default.  Some browsers may add page numbers and the URL of the printed page  along with the header and footer of the printed document.  URLs in MediaWiki   The way in which URLs  the addresses of pages  in MediaWiki are displayed  depends on the way in which PHP is installed on your wiki's server. If PHP runs  as an Apache module, the URLs are seen as wiki index.php Article_Title. If  PHP runs as a CGI  Common Gateway Interface  module, the URLs will be seen as  wiki index.php?title=Article_Title.   MediaWiki Print Styles Print URL  Let us assume that a normal page title in MediaWiki is wiki index.php  Article_Title, where wiki  is the directory of MediaWiki's install on your wiki's  server. The printable version of the page is accessible via the URL wiki index. php?title=Article_Title&printable=yes. The &printable=yes parameter added to the URL speciﬁ es that the printable  version of the page should be displayed. The URL for MediaWiki uses the friendly  URL structure. For example, wiki Article_Title uses the same printable URL  wiki index.php?title=Article_Title&printable=yes.  Wiki Markup  You can insert wiki markup into pages, to insert a link in the printable version of  pages on your wiki:  {{SERVER}}{{localurl:{{PAGENAME}}printable=yes}}   Escape your HTML To maintain the validity of the XHTML in your wiki, remember that  when inserting an ampersand  "&"  in to your skin's MediaWiki  template, you will need to "escape" it using the &amp; character  entity. This is particularly important in URLs, where link. html?d=content&e=more-content should be link.html?d=conte nt&amp;e=more-content.  What's Already Done for Us:  commonPrint.css The default print stylesheet for MediaWiki is linked to within the   element of  your wiki's template ﬁ le. It is called commonPrint.css, and is stored in the skins  common  directory of your MediaWiki installation.   You can add additional styling to this ﬁ le to accommodate your new skin, although  changing the CSS in this ﬁ le will cause the print styling for other MediaWiki skins to  change too.  [ 198 ]   Chapter 10  Backup commonPrint.css before you alter it. Creating a backup copy of the commonPrint.css ﬁ le is a good idea as  it could be useful for future reference. If you decide to remove your skin,  you can simply replace the previous version of the ﬁ le to keep the CSS  ﬁ le's size small.   The body of the document is styled to have a white background and black text to  make printed copies of the content easier to read:  body { background: White; color: Black; margin: 0; padding: 0; }   A Separate Print Stylesheet If you are planning to alter other skins' print styling, you can create a new print  stylesheet for your new skin. Just remember to link to it in your template's header:          Commenting out the stylesheet's import By commenting out the @import statement, you can prevent older Internet  browsers from becoming perplexed. So it is a good practice to get into.  External Links  A rather nice feature of MediaWiki's print styling is that where an external link is  given, it will append the link text with the absolute URL of the external page that is  linked to. This is shown in the following example  contrasted with an internal link   in browsers other than Internet Explorer:  [ 199 ]   MediaWiki Print Styles  This is done by the following CSS in the commonPrint.css ﬁ le:  content a.external.text:after, content a.external.autonumber:after {  * Expand URLs for printing *  content: "  " attr href  "  "; }  Page Content T he print stylesheet sets the width of the content on your wiki to "100" percent of the  page, so that there is no unnecessary white space on a visitor's printed page. It also  redeﬁ nes colors, padding, and margins of the main content areas to values suitable  for printing:  globalWrapper { width: 100% !important; min-width: 0 !important; } content { background : white; color : black; } column-content { margin: 0 !important; } column-content content { padding: 1em; margin: 0 !important; }  ul {  list-style-type: square; }  Lists are also restyled to have square bullet points when printed:  Serif or non-serif fonts Serif fonts  for example, "Times", "Times New Roman", and "Georgia"  are  supposedly easier to read on paper than sans-serif fonts more commonly  used on screen  those such as "Arial", "Verdana", and "Helvetica" . You  may want to consider redeﬁ ning your wiki's print stylesheet to use serif  fonts for its print version.  [ 200 ]   Site Notice T he siteNotice div contains the wiki-wide message as deﬁ ned on the MediaWiki: Sitenotice page:  Chapter 10  By default, MediaWiki's commonPrint.css ﬁ le hides this element from printing:  siteNotice { display: none; }  Table of Contents By  default, the table of contents in MediaWiki  toc  is shown in the print version,  and margins surrounding the various levels of the table of contents' hierarchy are  reset to sensible values:  Some more CSS is relevant to the table of contents which again resets indents:  toc {  border:1px solid aaaaaa; background-color:f9f9f9; padding:5px; } .tocindent { margin-left: 2em; } .tocline { margin-bottom: 0px; }  .tocindent p { margin: 0 0 0 0 ! important; }  [ 201 ]   MediaWiki Print Styles  Images So  me restyling of images in the page is undertaken, including re-coloring borders  and assigning margins, and also in ensuring that images ﬂ ow within the document  for the purpose of printing:  div.floatright {  float: right; clear: right; margin: 0; position:relative; border: 0.5em solid White; border-width: 0.5em 0 0.8em 1.4em; } div.floatright p { font-style: italic; }  div.floatleft {  float: left;  margin: 0.3em 0.5em 0.5em 0; position:relative; border: 0.5em solid White; border-width: 0.5em 1.4em 0.8em 0; } div.floatleft p { font-style: italic; }  div.thumb { margin-bottom: 0.5em; border-style: solid; border-color: White; width: auto; overflow: hidden; } div.thumb div { border:1px solid cccccc; padding: 3px !important; background-color:f9f9f9; font-size: 94%; text-align: center; } div.thumb div a img {  [ 202 ]  T  humbnail Images As  with full images, the thumbnail images in your wiki page are also restyled  to ensure that they are displayed properly on paper. Notably, the "magnify" icon  is hidden:   Chapter 10  border:1px solid cccccc; } div.thumb div div.thumbcaption { border: none; padding: 0.3em 0 0.1em 0; } div.magnify { display: none; } div.tright { float: right; clear: right; border-width: 0.5em 0 0.8em 1.4em; } div.tleft { float: left; margin-right:0.5em; border-width: 0.5em 1.4em 0.8em 0; } img.thumbborder { border: 1px solid dddddd; }  table.diff { background:white; } td.diff-otitle { background:ffffff; } td.diff-ntitle { background:ffffff; } td.diff-addedline { background:ccffcc; font-size: smaller; border: solid 2px black; } td.diff-deletedline { background:ffffaa; font-size: smaller; border: dotted 2px black;  [ 203 ]  D iff - document difference pages Me diaWiki's default print style also caters to the "diff" pages that display the  difference between two versions of the same page within the wiki. As with the rest of  print styling, the tables used in "diff" pages are styled with black as the text color and  white as the background color, while subtly highlighting the areas that have changed  with a light grey background  CCFFCC, FFFFAA :   MediaWiki Print Styles  } td.diff-context { background:eeeeee; font-size: smaller; } .diffchange { color: silver; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; }  Links So me links are also restyled for the printable version of your wiki pages. The internal  links in your wiki are de-styled, whereas the external links, and links to pages on  your wiki that have not yet been created:  a, a.external, a.new, a.stub { color: black ! important; text-decoration: none ! important; } a, a.external, a.new, a.stub { color: inherit ! important; text-decoration: inherit ! important; }  The second statement is for non-Internet Explorer browsers which  understand the inherit statement.  Footer and Miscellaneous Elements Th  e print stylesheet explicitly hides a number of elements in the page for printing,  including a number of links contained within list items in the footer and the  "powered by MediaWiki" badge. It also includes navigation surrounding the primary  content area, column-one:  .noprint, divjump-to-nav, div.top, divcolumn-one, colophon,  .editsection, .toctoggle, .tochidden, divf-poweredbyico, divf- copyrightico, liviewcount, liabout, lidisclaimer, liprivacy { display: none; }  What Remains to be Styled Ja zzMeet's on-line styling is also reasonable for a printable version of the wiki, but  we can still make some modiﬁ cations to it.  [ 204 ]   Chapter 10  [ 205 ]   MediaWiki Print Styles  The printable version of our wiki's pages looks good at the moment, but we can  make them a little easier to read when we print them by removing the colors in  tables and table of contents.  Co ntent Any  text surrounded with   or   tags in JazzMeet still appear red, so we  need to reset this for the printable version of our wiki:  globalWrapper strong, globalWrapper b { color: 000000 !important; }  Table of Contents Aft er styling the table of contents for JazzMeet, the print version's styling for the  table of contents is overwritten:  We can use !important statements in the existing CSS to ensure that the colors  are overwritten. Just in case, we will also set the color of the content in the table of  contents to black:  toc {  border:1px solid aaaaaa !important; background-color:f9f9f9 !important; color: 000000 !important; padding:5px; }  toc h2 { color: 000000 !important;  }  [ 206 ]  The   level heading that contains the table of contents' title still appears red, so  we need to reset this to black, too:   Cat egories The  category box still has its color from JazzMeet's main stylesheet:  Chapter 10  Because users printing the pages will not be able to click the category links on your  wiki's pages, we can hide these links.  catlinks { display: none !important; }  Tables of Data Table s of data in the printable version of the JazzMeet skin are still partially colored:  We will simply reset the colors in table header cells    . Refer to the  following code:   table th { background: DDDDDD !important; color: 000000 !important;  }  This leaves a more print-friendly table in our printable page, but the border's color  around the normal table cells     is still beige, which can be changed to gray  using the following code:  table td { border-color: DDDDDD !important;  }  [ 207 ]      MediaWiki Print Styles  Footer You can   add the class .noprint to elements in your MediaWiki template to render  them invisible in the printable version of the page. We can apply this to the two list  items in the footer that will not be required on paper. Refer to the following code:  In fact, we can hide the entire footer in the JazzMeet skin, since our "printfooter" is  contained outside the following:  Printfooter .printf ooter contains a reference to your wiki, that is, the location where your  visitor found the information he or she is printing. So it is a good idea to provide a  reference as to where the information came from:  .f-poweredby, .f-top { display: none; }  footer { display: none !important; }  .printfooter { font-size: 75%; display: block; margin-left: 10px; visibility: visible; }  New Message Notification As it s tands, the print stylesheet still shows the "new message" notiﬁ cation window:  [ 208 ]   Because there is no link on a paper that a user can click on, this will not be of any use  to your wiki's visitors to check their messages. So we can hide the .usermessage div  with some simple CSS. Refer to the following code:  Chapter 10  .usermessage { display: none !important }  Summary In this chapter, we covered the following:       The existing print stylesheet, commonPrint.css Building on the existing print stylesheet provided with MediaWiki  This chapter helps us in removing all unnecessary elements from the general wiki's  skin, and using colors with good contrast. It also explained how to minimize the  amount of ink used by your visitors to print each page.  [ 209 ]    Troubleshooting Browser  Issues with MediaWiki  Our new skin for the JazzMeet wiki appears to function correctly in the following  browsers: Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 2, and Opera 9. In this appendix, we will look  at the following:  The modes of interpretation that browsers apply to CSS: Standards mode and  Quirks mode Conditional comments for Internet Explorer Quick ﬁ xes to common quirks in Internet Explorer Fixes for bugs in other browsers, such as Opera and Firefox  Browser Modes Internet Explorer and other Internet browsers have two modes when it comes to  interpreting your CSS: Standards mode and Quirks mode.    Quirks mode helps browsers to display websites written in older HTML  as they would have been displayed when they were written. If they were  displayed within Standards mode, these  probably table-based  designs  would break.   Standards mode is used to interpret websites that provide a doctype  even if  the document itself does not actually validate to the provided doctype .                   Troubleshooting in Internet Explorer and MediaWiki  Standards Mode  The use of a doctype, such as the following one, triggers Standards mode in most   if not all  modern browsers:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:  www. w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">   Quirks Mode   Quirks mode is used by browsers for websites that do not present a doctype at the  top of the document.  For more information on Quirks mode, Wikipedia has an excellent article:  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Quirks_mode  Most errors displayed in webpages can be ﬁ xed with the application of the correct  doctype. It is often worth experimenting with the various doctypes before attempting  anything drastic to ﬁ x a problem. Conditional Comments Because the great majority of web designers use browsers that are more Standards- compliant than Internet Explorer - for example,  Firefox, Opera, and Safari—"bugs"  tend to appear in some pages when the pages are viewed in Internet Explorer, rather  than Firefox.  Conditional comments allow us to serve different stylesheets not only for Internet  Explorer, but even targeted to individual version of Internet Explorer. A conditional comment will be read as a traditional comment in browsers other  than Internet Explorer, that is, its contents will be ignored. But Internet Explorer will  recognize the syntax of the conditional comments and apply or display whatever is  shown within the comment, should the condition apply to the version of Internet  Explorer currently interpreting the webpage.  Versionless Conditional Comments in  Internet Explorer If you wish to supply a stylesheet or other content to the visitors of your wiki using  Internet Explorer, simply nest it within the following conditional comment syntax:     This will appear in Internet Explorer, but no other browsers.    [ 212 ]   Appendix A  For example, if we want to promote the Opera Internet browser  http:  www. opera.com  to JazzMeet's visitors using Internet Explorer, we could insert the  following conditional comment in a suitable place in our MediaWiki skin template:      Welcome to  JazzMeet ! Have you considered using  another browser such as <a href="http:  www.opera.com" title="Opera  browser">Opera ?       We can apply some styling to the use-opera ID in JazzMeet's CSS to lessen  its focus:  use-opera { background: E6E4D8; border-bottom: 2px 8C1425 solid; color: 38230C; font-size: 90%; padding: 10px; } use-opera a { color: 8C1425; }  Visitors to JazzMeet will now be met with a view similar to the following one for  visitors who visit the wiki in Internet Explorer:  In a browser such as Firefox or Opera, we don't see the message:  [ 213 ]   Troubleshooting in Internet Explorer and MediaWiki  Version-Based Conditional Comments in  Internet Explorer We  are able to focus on speciﬁ c versions of Internet Explorer in the following  three ways:           lt  less than : If the visitor is using a version of Internet Explorer less than  the given value, a message is displayed to your wiki's visitors, for example   This is version of IE is less than 6 . gte  greater than or equal to : If the visitor is using a version of Internet  Explorer greater than or equal to the given value, a message is displayed to  your wiki's visitors for example  This version of IE is  7 or greater  Lastly, you can specify a particular version of Internet Explorer, for example   This version of IE is 5. .  In Chapter 8, we added the ability for our users to add videos from video sharing  websites, such as Google Video and YouTube, to the editable section of JazzMeet  with the addition of the VideoFlash extension for MediaWiki.  We may want to inform visitors who are using versions of Internet Explorer of less  than ﬁ ve to upgrade their browsers to be able to view these videos that we can view  with the addition of a conditional comment:      In order to view videos and other media in the  JazzMeet<  strong> website, we suggest you <a href="http:  www.microsoft. com windows downloads ie getitnow.mspx" title="Upgrade your  browser">upgrade your version of Internet Explorer .      We can apply the same styling as our earlier conditional message:  use-opera,  upgrade-browser { background: E6E4D8; border-bottom: 2px 8C1425 solid; color: 38230C; font-size: 90%; padding: 10px; } use-opera a, upgrade-browser a { color: 8C1425; }  [ 214 ]   This presents the following message in versions 4 or less in Internet Explorer:   Appendix A     Stylesheets and Conditional Comments Ano ther use for these conditional comments is to supply additional stylesheets to  Internet Explorer in order to ﬁ x discrepancies in the design. Firstly, we will look at  some of the major problems that affect each version of Internet Explorer, and then  apply ﬁ xes for these to our new skin for the JazzMeet wiki.  Conditional Stylesheets By  adding a conditional comment to the   section of our MediaWiki skin  template, we can supply another stylesheet to make some changes to the design for  a speciﬁ c version of Internet Explorer. The following example shows how to link to a  stylesheet targeting only Internet Explorer 5:                    Some older versions of Internet Explorer may still be popular among some of your  wiki's visitors, and it may be worth making sure your design is compatible  with these.  [ 215 ]   Troubleshooting in Internet Explorer and MediaWiki  Internet Explorer 5 Bugs There are a number of bugs in Internet Explorer 5 that are easily ﬁ xed once you  know how to do so:         Background images  such as those used in external links in MediaWiki   do not show. The font size of Internet Explorer 5 and 5.5 is offset compared to  other browsers.  Background Image Bug Jaz  zMeet's CSS style links to pages on the wiki that have not been created yet,  as follows:  Because Internet Explorer 5 does not render these nicely, we will need to remove  these background images. We can create a new stylesheet, ie5fixes.css, in the  skins  directory of our MediaWiki installation, and link to it in the   of our  MediaWiki skin as demonstrated above.  We can then add CSS to overwrite previous styling associated with the "new article"  link styling: a.new { background: none; padding: 0; }  This removes the background image and the padding given for external links in the  previous CSS for JazzMeet's skin:  Font-Sizing Bug Inter net Explorer 5 and Internet Explorer 5.5 do not interpret the font-size you  set as other browsers do. You can correct this by adding the following CSS to the  ie5fixes.css ﬁ le:  body { font-size: xx-small }  [ 216 ]   Appendix A  This simply tells Internet Explorer 5 to resize the text to a smaller size than other  browsers, making the size of text appear consistent across the browsers.  Cursor Hand bug Anoth er noticeable bug in Internet Explorer 5.5 is that the "pointer" cursor does not  appear when you hover over the logo. This can be addressed by the following CSS  ﬁ x from MonoBook's skin:  p-logo a, p-logo a:hover {   }  cursor: pointer;  Internet Explorer 6 Bugs Some  of the common bugs in Internet Explorer 6 that we will ﬁ x are as follows:       The "double-margin" problem Inline list items' contents are only partially displayed  Double-Margin Bug The d  ouble-margin bug occurs in Internet Explorer when a ﬂ oated element, such as a  div, is given a margin on the side where it is ﬂ oated.  For example, assume that your MediaWiki skin contains the following HTML:  The highlighted CSS causes some problem in Internet Explorer:         Div two.         div-one { background: 222; height: 75px; } div-two {    background: 9C0; height: 50px; float: left; margin-left: 10px width: 300px; }  [ 217 ]   Troubleshooting in Internet Explorer and MediaWiki  Although the colors are just there to show where the two divs are positioned, the ﬂ oat  and margin cause problems. In Opera, Firefox, and Safari, this is displayed perfectly:  In Int  ernet Explorer 6, the margin alongside the left of the smaller  green  box  is doubled:  Luckily, the ﬁ x for this bug is simple. Just add display: inline to the inner div:  div-two { background: 9C0; height: 50px; display: inline; float: left; margin-left: 10px width: 300px; }  The inner container is now displayed as follows in Opera, Firefox, and Safari:  Inline List Items Partially Displayed Inline l ists not being displayed properly is a common problem in Internet Explorer.  To demonstrate the problem, we can create an unordered list of hyperlinks:      Link     Link     Link      We can now style these to display inline with CSS. Because such styling is usually  used to style a list of links as a menu within the webpage, we will add some padding  to the list item link:  ultest { list-style-type: none; }  [ 218 ]   Appendix A  test li { display: inline; } test li a { background: 8C1425; color: FFF padding: 10px; }  test li a { background: 8C1425; color: FFF padding: 10px; position: relative; }  In the earlier versions of Internet Explorer, this does not display as we intended:  Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Internet Explorer 7 display it as intended:  To remedy  the bug, we can apply position: relative to links within the list items:  Internet Explorer now displays the links as the other browsers do, and without  the use of a conditional comment to apply additional style to the elements in  Internet Explorer:  Bugs in Other Browsers Unlike Inte rnet Explorer, there is no standard way of determining a browser or  its version in HTML alone. To target separate stylesheets at visitors to your wiki  using these browsers, the easiest way is probably through the use of JavaScript, as  described by Quirks Mode: http:  www.quirksmode.org js detect.html  Firefox Bugs Bugs in Fir  efox are less common than in Internet Explorer, but there are some things  that may be useful to ﬁ x, including empty divs.  [ 219 ]   Troubleshooting in Internet Explorer and MediaWiki  Empty Divs Not Clearing Some versio ns of Firefox will not properly interpret an empty div that has the  clear: both CSS attribute assigned to it. To ﬁ x this , simply give some padding to  the div as follows: padding-top: .01em  Testing your Design in Multiple Browsers It is not e asy to spot ﬂ aws in your design as, even if you have many browsers  installed on your computer, you will almost certainly not have access to every  browser on every platform. You can use services such as BrowserCam  http:  www.browsercam.com  to view  your MediaWiki skin's design in multiple browsers without needing access to  different operating systems:     [ 220 ]   Appendix A  Although BrowserCam is not a free service, you can try it for a limited  period with a free trial.   BrowserCam also allows you to see the design as it would be displayed on different  devices, including Blackberry handheld devices and other PDAs  personal  digital assistants .  Cheaper Alternatives for Testing If you are r edesigning an existing wiki, a cheaper alternative could be to ask a  smaller portion of your wiki's community to test a new design before you release it  to your live website. Alternatively, you can ask friends and family to test the design  on as many different computers and browsers as possible.

Our aim at Packt is to establish publishing royalties as an essential part of the service and  support a business model that sustains Open Source.
