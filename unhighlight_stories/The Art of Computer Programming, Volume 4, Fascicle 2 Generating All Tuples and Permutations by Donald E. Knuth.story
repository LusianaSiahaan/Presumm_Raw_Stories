Zeroth printing  revision 12 , 10 Deember 2004  -2   PREFACE  I thought it worth a Dayes labour,  to write something on this Art or Siene,  that the Rules thereof might not be lost and obsured.   RICHARD DUCKWORTH, Tintinnalogia  1668   This booklet ontains draft material that I'm irulating to experts in the   cid:12 eld, in hopes that they an help remove its most egregious errors before too  many other people see it.  I am also, however, posting it on the Internet for  ourageous and or random readers who don't mind the risk of reading a few  pages that have not yet reahed a very mature state. Beware: This material has  not yet been proofread as thoroughly as the manusripts of Volumes 1, 2, and 3  were at the time of their  cid:12 rst printings. And those arefully-heked volumes,  alas, were subsequently found to ontain thousands of mistakes.  Given this aveat, I hope that my errors this time will not be so numerous  and or obtrusive that you will be disouraged from reading the material arefully.  I did try to make it both interesting and authoritative, as far as it goes. But the   cid:12 eld is so vast, I annot hope to have surrounded it enough to orral it ompletely.  Therefore I beg you to let me know about any de cid:12 ienies you disover.  To put the material in ontext, this is Setion 7.2.1.2 of a long, long hapter  on ombinatorial algorithms. Chapter 7 will eventually  cid:12 ll three volumes  namely  Volumes 4A, 4B, and 4C , assuming that I'm able to remain healthy.  It will  begin with a short review of graph theory, with emphasis on some highlights  of signi cid:12 ant graphs in The Stanford GraphBase  from whih I will be drawing  many examples . Then omes Setion 7.1, whih deals with the topi of bitwise  manipulations.  I drafted about 60 pages about that sub jet in 1977, but those  pages need extensive revision; meanwhile I've deided to work for awhile on  the material that follows it, so that I an get a better feel for how muh to  ut.  Setion 7.2 is about generating all possibilities, and it begins with Setion  7.2.1: Generating Basi Combinatorial Patterns  whih, in turn, begins with  Setion 7.2.1.1, \Generating all n-tuples."  Readers of the present booklet should  have already looked at Setion 7.2.1.1, a draft of whih is available as Pre-  Fasile 2A.  That sets the stage for the main ontents of this booklet, Setion  7.2.1.2: \Generating all permutations." Then will ome Setion 7.2.1.3  about  ombinations , et. Setion 7.2.2 will deal with baktraking in general. And  so it will go on, if all goes well; an outline of the entire Chapter 7 as urrently  envisaged appears on the taop webpage that is ited on page ii.  iii  -3   iv  PREFACE  Even the apparently lowly topi of permutation generation turns out to be  surprisingly rih, with ties to Setions 1.2.9, 1.3.3, 2.2.3, 2.3.4.2, 3.4.2, 4.1, 5.1.1,  5.1.2, 5.1.4, 5.2.1, 5.2.2, 5.3.1, and 6.1 of the  cid:12 rst three volumes. There also is  material related to the MMIX omputer, de cid:12 ned in Setion 1.3.1  of Fasile 1.  0  I strongly believe in building up a  cid:12 rm foundation, so I have disussed this topi  muh more thoroughly than I will be able to do with material that is newer or  less basi. To my surprise, I ame up with 112 exerises, even though  believe  it or not  I had to eliminate quite a bit of the interesting material that appears  in my  cid:12 les.  Some of the things presented are new, to the best of my knowledge, although  I will not be at all surprised to learn that my own little \disoveries" have been  disovered before. Please look, for example, at the exerises that I've lassed as  researh problems  rated with diÆulty level 46 or higher , namely exerises 71  and 109; I've also impliitly posed additional unsolved questions in the answers  to exerises 28, 58, 63, 67, 100, 106, and 112. Are those problems still open?  Please let me know if you know of a solution to any of these intriguing questions.  And of ourse if no solution is known today but you do make progress on any of  them in the future, I hope you'll let me know.  I urgently need your help also with respet to some exerises that I made  up as I was preparing this material. I ertainly don't like to get redit for things  that have already been published by others, and most of these results are quite  natural \fruits" that were just waiting to be \pluked." Therefore please tell  me if you know who I should have redited, with respet to the ideas found in  exerises 6, 7, 20, 25, 41, 55, 60, 65, 66, 67, 69, 70, 76, 89, 99, 104, and or 106.  I shall happily pay a  cid:12 nder's fee of $2.56 for eah error in this draft when it is   cid:12 rst reported to me, whether that error be typographial, tehnial, or historial.  The same reward holds for items that I forgot to put in the index. And valuable  suggestions for improvements to the text are worth 32  eah.  Furthermore, if  you  cid:12 nd a better solution to an exerise, I'll atually reward you with immortal  glory instead of mere money, by publishing your name in the eventual book: cid:0    Cross referenes to yet-unwritten material sometimes appear as `00'; this  impossible value is a plaeholder for the atual numbers to be supplied later.

Hene all we need to do is to produe  all 10 digit numbers and selet only those whose digits are distint.  Isn't it wonderful how high speed omputing saves us from  the drudgery of thinking! We simply program k + 1 ! k  and examine the digits of k for undesirable equalities.  This gives us the permutations in ditionary order too!  On seond sober thought : : : we do need to think of something else.   D. H. LEHMER  1957   7.2.1.2. Generating all permutations. After n-tuples, the next most im-  portant item on nearly everybody's wish list for ombinatorial generation is the  task of visiting all permutations of some given set or multiset. Many di cid:11 erent  ways have been devised to solve this problem. In fat, almost as many di cid:11 erent  algorithms have been published for unsorting as for sorting! We will study the  most important permutation generators in this setion, beginning with a lassial  method that is both simple and  cid:13 exible:  Algorithm L  Lexiographi permutation generation  . Given a sequene of n  elements a  a  : : : a  , initially sorted so that  1  2  n  a   cid:20  a   cid:20   cid:1   cid:1   cid:1   cid:20  a  ;   1   1  2  n  this algorithm generates all permutations of fa  ; a  ; : : : ; a  g, visiting them in  1  2  n  lexiographi order.  For example, the permutations of f1; 2; 2; 3g are  1223; 1232; 1322; 2123; 2132; 2213; 2231; 2312; 2321; 3122; 3212; 3221;  ordered lexiographially.

At this point j is the smallest  j  j+1  subsript suh that we have already visited all permutations beginning with  a  : : : a  .

Hindenburg's prefae to Speimen Analytium  de Lineis Curvis Seundi Ordinis by C. F. R cid:127 udiger  Leipzig: 1784 , xlvi{xlvii,  and it has been frequently redisovered ever sine. The parenthetial remarks in  steps L2 and L3 explain why it works.  In general, the lexiographi suessor of any ombinatorial pattern a  : : : a  1  n  is obtainable by a three-step proedure:  1  Find the largest j suh that a  an be inreased.  j  2  Inrease a  by the smallest feasible amount.  j  3  Find the lexiographially least way to extend the new a  : : : a  to a omplete  1  j  pattern.  Algorithm L follows this general proedure in the ase of permutation generation,  just as Algorithm 7.2.1.1M followed it in the ase of n-tuple generation; we will  see numerous further instanes later, as we onsider other kinds of ombinatorial  patterns. Notie that we have a   cid:21   cid:1   cid:1   cid:1   cid:21  a  at the beginning of step L4.  j+1  n  Therefore the  cid:12 rst permutation beginning with the urrent pre cid:12 x a  : : : a  is  1  j  a  : : : a  a  : : : a  , and step L4 produes it by doing b n  cid:0  j  =2 interhanges.  1  j  n  j+1  In pratie, step L2  cid:12 nds j = n  cid:0  1 half of the time when the elements are  distint, beause exatly n!=2 of the n! permutations have a  < a  . Therefore  n cid:0 1  n  Algorithm L an be speeded up by reognizing this speial ase, without making  it signi cid:12 antly more ompliated.  See exerise 1.  Similarly, the probability  that j  cid:20  n  cid:0  t is only 1=t! when the a's are distint; hene the loops in steps L2{  L4 usually go very fast. Exerise 6 analyzes the running time in general, showing  that Algorithm L is reasonably eÆient even when equal elements are present,  unless some values appear muh more often than others do in the multiset  fa  ; a  ; : : : ; a  g.  1  2  n  Adjaent interhanges. We saw in Setion 7.2.1.1 that Gray odes are ad-  vantageous for generating n-tuples, and similar onsiderations apply when we  want to generate permutations. The simplest possible hange to a permutation  is to interhange adjaent elements, and we know from Chapter 5 that any  2   7.2.1.2  GENERATING ALL PERMUTATIONS  3  permutation an be sorted into order if we make a suitable sequene of suh  interhanges.  For example, Algorithm 5.2.2B works in this way.  Hene we an  go bakward and obtain any desired permutation, by starting with all elements  in order and then exhanging appropriate pairs of adjaent elements.  A natural question now arises: Is it possible to run through al l permutations  of a given multiset in suh a way that only two adjaent elements hange plaes  at every step? If so, the overall program that is examining all permutations will  often be simpler and faster, beause it will only need to alulate the e cid:11 et of  an exhange instead of to reproess an entirely new array a  : : : a  eah time.  1  n  Alas, when the multiset has repeated elements, we an't always  cid:12 nd suh  a Gray-like sequene. For example, the six permutations of f1; 1; 2; 2g are on-  neted to eah other in the following way by adjaent interhanges:  1122  1212  2121  2211  ;   2   2112  1221  this graph has no Hamiltonian path.  But most appliations deal with permutations of distint elements, and for  this ase there is good news: A simple algorithm makes it possible to generate  all n! permutations by making just n!  cid:0  1 adjaent interhanges. Furthermore,  another suh interhange returns to the starting point, so we have a Hamiltonian  yle analogous to Gray binary ode.  The idea is to take suh a sequene for f1; : : : ; n  cid:0  1g and to insert the  number n into eah permutation in all ways. For example, if n = 4 the sequene   123; 132; 312; 321; 231; 213  leads to the olumns of the array  1234  1324  3124  3214  2314  2134  1243  1342  3142  3241  2341  2143   3   1423  1432  3412  3421  2431  2413  4123  4132  4312  4321  4231  4213  when 4 is inserted in all four possible positions. Now we obtain the desired  sequene by reading downwards in the  cid:12 rst olumn, upwards in the seond, down-  wards in the third, : : : , upwards in the last:  1234; 1243; 1423; 4123; 4132; 1432;  1342; 1324; 3124; 3142; : : : ; 2143; 2134 .  In Setion 5.1.1 we studied the inversions of a permutation, namely the pairs  of elements  not neessarily adjaent  that are out of order. Every interhange  of adjaent elements hanges the total number of inversions by  cid:6 1. In fat, when  we onsider the so-alled inversion table   : : :   of exerise 5.1.1{7, where   is  1  n  j  the number of elements lying to the right of j that are less than j , we  cid:12 nd that  the permutations in  3  have the following inversion tables:  0000  0010  0020  0120  0110  0100  0001  0011  0021  0121  0111  0101   4   0002  0012  0022  0122  0112  0102  0003  0013  0023  0123  0113  0103  And if we read these olumns alternately down and up as before, we obtain  preisely the re cid:13 eted Gray ode for mixed radies  1; 2; 3; 4 , as in Eqs.  46 { 51   3   4  COMBINATORIAL ALGORITHMS  F2B   7.2.1.2  of Setion 7.2.1.1. The same property holds for all n, as notied by E. W. Dijkstra  [Ata Informatia 6  1976 , 357{359℄, and it leads us to the following formulation:  Algorithm P  Plain hanges  . Given a sequene a  a  : : : a  of n distint  1  2  n  elements, this algorithm generates all of their permutations by repeatedly inter-  hanging adjaent pairs. It uses an auxiliary array     : : :   , whih represents  1  2  n  inversions as desribed above, running through all sequenes of integers suh that  0  cid:20    < j  for 1  cid:20  j  cid:20  n.   5   j  Another array o  o  : : : o  governs the diretions by whih the entries   hange.  1  2  n  j  P1.

They alled Algorithm P the method of plain  hanges. Figure 18 a  illustrates the \Cambridge Forty-Eight," an irregular  and ad ho sequene of 48 permutations on 5 bells that had been used in  the early 1600s, before the plain-hange priniple revealed how to ahieve all  5! = 120 possibilities. The venerable history of Algorithm P has been traed to  a manusript by Peter Mundy now in the Bodleian Library, written about 1653  and transribed by Ernest Morris in The History and Art of Change Ringing   1931 , 29{30. Shortly afterwards, a famous book alled Tintinnalogia, published  anonymously in 1668 but now known to have been written by Rihard Dukworth  and Fabian Stedman, devoted its  cid:12 rst 60 pages to a detailed desription of plain  hanges, working up from n = 3 to the ase of arbitrarily large n.  was the greatest Peal that was Rang or invented; but now,  Cambridge Forty-eight, for many years,  neither Forty-eight, nor a Hundred, nor Seven-hundred and twenty,  nor any Number an on cid:12 ne us; for we an Ring Changes, Ad in cid:12 nitum.  : : : On four Bells, there are Twenty four several Changes,  in Ringing of whih, there is one Bell alled the Hunt,  and the other three are Extream Bells;  the Hunt moves, and hunts up and down ontinually : : : ;  two of the Extream Bells makes a Change  every time the Hunt omes before or behind them.

For  example, they devised the pattern in Fig. 18   known as Grandsire Doubles,  \the best and most ingenious Peal that ever was omposed, to be rang on  cid:12 ve  bells" [Tintinnalogia, page 95℄. Suh fanier methods are more interesting than  Algorithm P from a musial or mathematial standpoint, but they are less useful  in omputer appliations, so we shall not dwell on them here. Interested readers  an learn more by reading W. G. Wilson's book, Change Ringing  1965 ; see  also A. T. White, AMM 103  1996 , 771{778.  H. F. Trotter published the  cid:12 rst omputer implementation of plain hanges  in CACM 5  1962 , 434{435. The algorithm is quite eÆient, espeially when it  is streamlined as in exerise 16, beause n  cid:0  1 out of every n permutations are  generated without using steps P6 and P7. By ontrast, Algorithm L enjoys its  best ase only about half of the time.  The fat that Algorithm P does exatly one interhange per visit means that  the permutations it generates are alternately even and odd  see exerise 5.1.1{  13 . Therefore we an generate all the even permutations by simply bypassing  the odd ones. In fat, the  and o tables make it easy to keep trak of the urrent  total number of inversions,   +  cid:1   cid:1   cid:1  +   , as we go.  1  n  Many programs need to generate the same permutations repeatedly, and in  suh ases we needn't run through the steps of Algorithm P eah time. We an  simply prepare a list of suitable transitions, using the following method:  Algorithm T  Plain hange transitions  . This algorithm omputes a table t[1℄,  t[2℄, : : : , t[n!  cid:0  1℄ suh that the ations of Algorithm P are equivalent to the  suessive interhanges a  $ a  for 1  cid:20  k < n!.

But  let's suppose we want to deal with a large set of ompliated alphametis, some  of whih may be unsolvable while others may have dozens of solutions. Then we  an save time by programming a omputer to try out all permutations of digits  that math a given pattern, seeing whih permutations yield a orret sum.  [A omputer program for solving alphametis was published by John Beidler in  Creative Computing 4, 6  November{Deember 1978 , 110{113.℄  We might as well raise our sights slightly and onsider additive alphametis  in general, dealing not only with simple sums like  6  but also with examples like  VIOLIN + VIOLIN + VIOLA = TRIO + SONATA:  Equivalently, we want to solve puzzles suh as  2 VIOLIN  + VIOLA  cid:0  TRIO  cid:0  SONATA = 0 ;   7   where a sum of terms with integer oeÆients is given and the goal is to obtain  zero by substituting distint deimal digits for the di cid:11 erent letters. Eah letter  in suh a problem has a \signature" obtained by substituting 1 for that letter  and 0 for the others; for example, the signature for I in  7  is  2 010010  + 01000  cid:0  0010  cid:0  000000;  namely 21010.  If we arbitrarily assign the odes  1; 2; : : : ; 10  to the letters   V; I; O; L; N; A; T; R; S; X , the respetive signatures orresponding to  7  are  s  = 210000;  s  = 21010;  s  =  cid:0 7901;  s  = 210;  s  =  cid:0 998;  1  2  3  4  5   8   s  =  cid:0 100;  s  =  cid:0 1010;  s  =  cid:0 100;  s  =  cid:0 100000;  s  = 0:  6  7  8  9  10  6   7.2.1.2  GENERATING ALL PERMUTATIONS  7   An additional letter, X, has been added beause we need ten of them.  The  problem now is to  cid:12 nd all permutations a  : : : a  of f0; 1; : : : ; 9g suh that  1  10  a  cid:1  s =  a  s  = 0:   9   j  j  10  X  j=1  There also is a side ondition, beause the numbers in alphametis should not  have zero as a leading digit. For example, the sums  7316  5731  6524  2817  + 0823  + 0647  + 0735  + 0368  and  and  and  08139  06378  07259  03185  and numerous others are not onsidered to be valid solutions of  6 . In general  there is a set F of  cid:12 rst letters suh that we must have  a  6= 0  for all j 2 F ;   10   j  the set F orresponding to  7  and  8  is f1; 7; 9g.  One way to takle a family of additive alphametis is to start by using  Algorithm T to prepare a table of 10!  cid:0  1 transitions t[k ℄. Then, for eah problem  de cid:12 ned by a signature sequene  s  ; : : : ; s    and a  cid:12 rst-letter set F , we an  1  10  exhaustively look for solutions as follows:  A1. [Initialize.℄ Set a  a  : : : a    01 : : : 9, v     j  cid:0  1 s  , k   1, and  1  2  10  j  P  10  j=1  Æ    s   cid:0  s  for 1  cid:20  j < 10.  j  j+1  j  A2. [Test.℄ If v = 0 and if  10  holds, output the solution a  : : : a  .  1  10  A3. [Swap.℄ Stop if k = 10!. Otherwise set j   t[k ℄, v   v  cid:0   a   cid:0  a    Æ  ,  j+1  j  j  a  $ a  , k   k + 1, and return to A2.  j+1  j  Step A3 is justi cid:12 ed by the fat that swapping a  with a  simply dereases a  cid:1  s  j  j+1  by  a   cid:0  a    s   cid:0  s   . Even though 10! is 3,628,800, a fairly large number,  j+1  j  j+1  j  the operations in step A3 are so simple that the whole job takes only a fration  of a seond on a modern omputer.  An alphameti is said to be pure if it has a unique solution. Unfortunately   7  is not pure; the permutations 1764802539 and 3546281970 both solve  9  and   10 , hene we have both  176478 + 176478 + 17640 = 2576 + 368020  and  354652 + 354652 + 35468 = 1954 + 742818:  Furthermore s  = s  in  8 , so we an obtain two more solutions by interhanging  6  8  the digits assigned to A and R.  On the other hand  6  is pure, yet the method we have desribed will  cid:12 nd  two di cid:11 erent permutations that solve it. The reason is that  6  involves only  eight distint letters, hene we will set it up for solution by using two dummy  signatures s  = s  = 0. In general, an alphameti with m distint letters will  9  10  have 10  cid:0  m dummy signatures s  =  cid:1   cid:1   cid:1  = s  = 0, and eah of its solutions  m+1  10  will be found  10  cid:0  m ! times unless we insist that, say, a  <  cid:1   cid:1   cid:1  < a  .  m+1  10  7   8  COMBINATORIAL ALGORITHMS  F2B   7.2.1.2  A general framework. A great many algorithms have been proposed for  generating permutations of distint ob jets, and the best way to understand  them is to apply the multipliative properties of permutations that we studied  in Setion 1.3.3. For this purpose we will hange our notation slightly, by using  0-origin indexing and writing a  a  : : : a  for permutations of f0; 1; : : : ; n  cid:0  1g  0  1  n cid:0 1  instead of writing a  a  : : : a  for permutations of f1; 2; : : : ; ng. More importantly,  1  2  n  we will onsider shemes for generating permutations in whih most of the ation  takes plae at the left, so that all permutations of f0; 1; : : : ; k  cid:0  1g will be  generated during the  cid:12 rst k ! steps, for 1  cid:20  k  cid:20  n. For example, one suh  sheme for n = 4 is  0123; 1023; 0213; 2013; 1203; 2103; 0132; 1032; 0312; 3012; 1302; 3102;  0231; 2031; 0321; 3021; 2301; 3201; 1230; 2130; 1320; 3120; 2310; 3210 ;   11   this is alled \reverse olex order," beause if we re cid:13 et the strings from right  to left we get 3210, 3201, 3120, : : : , 0123, the reverse of lexiographi order.  Another way to think of  11  is to view the entries as  n cid:0 a    : : :  n cid:0 a    n cid:0 a   ,  n  2  1  where a  a  : : : a  runs lexiographially through the permutations of f1; 2; : : : ; ng.  1  2  n  Let's reall from Setion 1.3.3 that a permutation like  cid:11  = 250143 an be  written either in the two-line form  or in the more ompat yle form   cid:16    cid:17   0 1 2 3 4 5   cid:11  =  2 5 0 1 4 3   cid:11  =  0 2   1 5 3 ;  with the meaning that  cid:11  takes 0 7! 2, 1 7! 5, 2 7! 0, 3 7! 1, 4 7! 4, and  5 7! 3; a 1-yle like ` 4 ' need not be indiated. Sine 4 is a  cid:12 xed point of this  permutation we say that \ cid:11   cid:12 xes 4." We also write 0 cid:11  = 2, 1 cid:11  = 5, and so on,  saying that j  cid:11  is \the image of j under  cid:11 ." Multipliation of permutations, like   cid:11  times  cid:12  where  cid:12  = 543210, is readily arried out either in the two-line form   cid:16    cid:17  cid:16    cid:17    cid:16    cid:17  cid:16    cid:17    cid:16    cid:17   0 1 2 3 4 5  0 1 2 3 4 5  0 1 2 3 4 5  2 5 0 1 4 3  0 1 2 3 4 5   cid:11  cid:12  =  =  =  2 5 0 1 4 3  5 4 3 2 1 0  2 5 0 1 4 3  3 0 5 4 1 2  3 0 5 4 1 2  or in the yle form   cid:11  cid:12  =  0 2   1 5 3   cid:1   0 5   1 4  2 3  =  0 3 4 1   2 5 :  Notie that the image of 1 under  cid:11  cid:12  is 1  cid:11  cid:12    =  1 cid:11   cid:12  = 5 cid:12  = 0, et. Warning:  About half of all books that deal with permutations multiply them the other way   from right to left , imagining that  cid:11  cid:12  means that  cid:12  should be applied before  cid:11 .  The reason is that traditional funtional notation, in whih one writes  cid:11  1  = 5,  makes it natural to think that  cid:11  cid:12   1  should mean  cid:11   cid:12   1   =  cid:11  4  = 4. However,  the present book subsribes to the other philosophy, and we shall always multiply  permutations from left to right.  The order of multipliation needs to be understood arefully when permu-  tations are represented by arrays of numbers. For example, if we \apply" the  re cid:13 etion  cid:12  = 543210 to the permutation  cid:11  = 250143, the result 341052 is not  cid:11  cid:12   8   7.2.1.2  GENERATING ALL PERMUTATIONS  9  but  cid:12  cid:11 . In general, the operation of replaing a permutation  cid:11  = a  a  : : : a  0  1  n cid:0 1  by some rearrangement a  a  : : : a  takes k 7! a  = k cid:12  cid:11 . Permuting  0 cid:12   1 cid:12   k cid:12    n cid:0 1  cid:12   the positions by  cid:12  orresponds to premultipliation by  cid:12  , hanging  cid:11  to  cid:12  cid:11 ;  permuting the values by  cid:12  orresponds to postmultipliation by  cid:12  , hanging  cid:11   to  cid:11  cid:12  . Thus, for example, a permutation generator that interhanges a  $ a  is  premultiplying the urrent permutation by  1 2 , postmultiplying it by  a  a   .  Following a proposal made by  Evariste Galois in 1830, a nonempty set G   cid:19   1  2  1  2  of permutations is said to form a group if it is losed under multipliation, that  is, if the produt  cid:11  cid:12  is in G whenever  cid:11  and  cid:12  are elements of G [see  Erits   cid:19   et M cid:19 emoires Math cid:19 ematiques d'  Evariste Galois  Paris: 1962 , 47℄. Consider, for   cid:19   example, the 4-ube represented as a 4  cid:2  4 torus  0 1 3 2  4 5 7 6   d f e  8 9 b a   12   as in exerise 7.2.1.1{17, and let G be the set of all permutations of the verties  f0; 1; : : : ; fg that preserve adjaeny: A permutation  cid:11  is in G if and only if  u  cid:0  cid:0  cid:0  v implies u cid:11   cid:0  cid:0  cid:0  v cid:11  in the 4-ube.   Here we are using hexadeimal  digits  0; 1; : : : ; f  to stand for the integers  0; 1; : : : ; 15 . The labels in  12   are hosen so that u  cid:0  cid:0  cid:0  v if and only if u and v di cid:11 er in only one bit position.   This set G is obviously a group, and its elements are alled the symmetries or  \automorphisms" of the 4-ube.  Groups of permutations G are onveniently represented inside a omputer by  means of a Sims table, introdued by Charles C. Sims [Computational Methods  in Abstrat Algebra  Oxford: Pergamon, 1970 , 169{183℄, whih is a family of  subsets S  , S  , : : : of G having the following property: S  ontains exatly one  1  2  k  permutation  cid:27   that takes k 7! j and  cid:12 xes the values of all elements greater  kj  than k , whenever G ontains suh a permutation. We let  cid:27   be the identity  kk  permutation, whih is always present in G; but when 0  cid:20  j < k , any suitable  permutation an be seleted to play the role of  cid:27   . The main advantage of a  kj  Sims table is that it provides a onvenient representation of the entire group:  Lemma S. Let S  , S  , : : : , S  be a Sims table for a group G of permutations  1  2  n cid:0 1  on f0; 1; : : : ; n  cid:0  1g. Then every element  cid:11  of G has a unique representation   cid:11  =  cid:27    cid:27   : : :  cid:27   ;  where  cid:27   2 S  for 1  cid:20  k < n.   13   1  2  n cid:0 1  k  k  Proof. If  cid:11  has suh a representation and if  cid:27   is the permutation  cid:27   2  n cid:0 1   n cid:0 1 j  S  , then  cid:11  takes n  cid:0  1 7! j , beause all elements of S  [  cid:1   cid:1   cid:1  [ S   cid:12 x the  n cid:0 1  1  n cid:0 2  value of n  cid:0  1. Conversely, if  cid:11  takes n  cid:0  1 7! j we have  cid:11  =  cid:11    cid:27   , where  0   cid:0    cid:11   =  cid:11   cid:27    n cid:0 1 j  0   n cid:0 1 j   cid:0   is a permutation of G that  cid:12 xes n  cid:0  1.  As in Setion 1.3.3,  cid:27   denotes the  inverse of  cid:27  .  The set G  of all suh permutations is a group, and S  , : : : , S  1  n cid:0 2  0  0  is a Sims table for G  ; therefore the result follows by indution on n.  9   10  COMBINATORIAL ALGORITHMS  F2B   7.2.1.2  For example, a bit of alulation shows that one possible Sims table for the  automorphism group of the 4-ube is  S  = f  ;  01  23  45  67  89  ab  d  ef ; : : : ;  S  = f  ;  12  56  9a  de ;  14  36  9  be ;  18  3a  5  7e g;   0f  1e  2d  3  4b  5a  69  78 g;  S  = f  ;  24  35  a  bd ;  28  39  6  7d g;   14   f  e  d    b  S  = f  g;  S  = f  ;  48  59  6a  7b g;  S  = S  =  cid:1   cid:1   cid:1  = S  = f  g;  a  9  1  here S  ontains 16 permutations  cid:27   for 0  cid:20  j  cid:20  15, whih respetively take  f  fj  i 7! i  cid:8   15  cid:0  j   for 0  cid:20  i  cid:20  15. The set S  ontains only four permutations,  e  beause an automorphism that  cid:12 xes f must take e into a neighbor of f; thus the  image of e must be either e or d or b or 7. The set S  ontains only the identity    permutation, beause an automorphism that  cid:12 xes f, e, and d must also  cid:12 x .  Most groups have S  = f  g for all small values of k , as in this example; hene a  k  Sims table usually needs to ontain only a fairly small number of permutations  although the group itself might be quite large.  The Sims representation  13  makes it easy to test if a given permutation  cid:11   lies in G: First we determine  cid:27   =  cid:27   , where  cid:11  takes n  cid:0  1 7! j , and we  n cid:0 1   n cid:0 1 j  0  0  0  let  cid:11   =  cid:11   cid:27   ; then we determine  cid:27   =  cid:27   , where  cid:11   takes n  cid:0  2 7! j  ,  0  n cid:0 2   n cid:0 2 j   cid:0   n cid:0 1  00  0   cid:0   and we let  cid:11   =  cid:11    cid:27   ; and so on. If at any stage the required  cid:27   does not  n cid:0 2  kj  exist in S  , the original permutation  cid:11  does not belong to G. In the ase of  14 ,  k  this proess must redue  cid:11  to the identity after  cid:12 nding  cid:27   ,  cid:27   ,  cid:27   ,  cid:27   , and  cid:27   .  f  e  d    b  For example, let  cid:11  be the permutation  14  28  3  69  7d  be , whih or-  responds to transposing  12  about its main diagonal f0; 5; f; ag. Sine  cid:11   cid:12 xes f,   cid:27   will be the identity permutation   , and  cid:11   =  cid:11 . Then  cid:27   is the member of S  f  e  e  0  00  that takes e 7! b, namely  14  36  9  be , and we  cid:12 nd  cid:11   =  28  39  6  7d .  This permutation belongs to S  , so  cid:11  is indeed an automorphism of the 4-ube.  d  Conversely,  13  also makes it easy to generate all elements of the orre-  sponding group. We simply run through all permutations of the form   cid:27  1;     cid:27  2;     : : :  cid:27  n  cid:0  1;    ;  1  2  n cid:0 1  where  cid:27  k ;     is the    + 1 st element of S  for 0  cid:20    < s  = jS  j and  k  k  k  k  k  k  1  cid:20  k < n, using any algorithm of Setion 7.2.1.1 that runs through all  n  cid:0  1 -  tuples    ; : : : ;     for the respetive radies  s  ; : : : ; s   .  1  n cid:0 1  1  n cid:0 1  Using the general framework. Our hief onern is the group of al l permuta-  tions on f0; 1; : : : ; n cid:0  1g, and in this ase every set S  of a Sims table will ontain  k  k + 1 elements f cid:27  k ; 0 ;  cid:27  k ; 1 ; : : : ;  cid:27  k ; k g, where  cid:27  k ; 0  is the identity and the  others take k to the values f0; : : : ; k  cid:0  1g in some order.  The permutation  cid:27  k ; j    need not be the same as  cid:27   , and it usually is di cid:11 erent.  Every suh Sims table  kj  leads to a permutation generator, aording to the following outline:  10   7.2.1.2  GENERATING ALL PERMUTATIONS  11  Algorithm G  General permutation generator  .

A heavy line onnets node   2  3  3  to node   0 and node     to node     0, beause  cid:27  2; 0  and  cid:27  1; 0  are the  3  3  2  3  2  identity permutation and these nodes are essentially equivalent. Adding 1 to the  mixed-radix number       in step G3 orresponds to moving from one node of  3  2  1  Fig. 19 to its suessor in preorder, and the transformation in step G4 hanges  the permutations aordingly. For example, when       hanges from 121 to  3  2  1  200, step G4 premultiplies the urrent permutation by   cid:28   3; 2  ! 2   =  cid:28   3; 2   cid:27  2; 2    cid:27  1; 1   ;   cid:0    cid:0    cid:0   11   12  COMBINATORIAL ALGORITHMS  F2B   7.2.1.2  premultiplying by  cid:27  1; 1   takes us from node 121 to node 12, premultiplying   cid:0   by  cid:27  2; 2   takes us from node 12 to node 1, and premultiplying by  cid:28   3; 2  =   cid:27  3; 2  cid:27  3; 1   takes us from node 1 to node 2  cid:17  200, whih is the preorder su-  essor of node 121. Stating this another way, premultipliation by  cid:28   3; 2 ! 2    cid:0   is exatly what is needed to hange  cid:27  1; 1  cid:27  2; 2  cid:27  3; 1  to  cid:27  1; 0  cid:27  2; 0  cid:27  3; 2 ,   cid:0    cid:0   preserving  17 .  Algorithm G de cid:12 nes a huge number of permutation generators  see exer-  ise 37 , so it is no wonder that many of its speial ases have appeared in the  literature. Of ourse some of its variants are muh more eÆient than others,  and we want to  cid:12 nd examples where the operations are partiularly well suited  to the omputer we are using.  We an, for instane, obtain permutations in reverse olex order as a speial  ase of Algorithm G  see  11  , by letting  cid:27  k ; j   be the  j + 1 -yle   cid:27  k ; j   =  k cid:0 j k cid:0 j+1 : : : k  :   18   The reason is that  cid:27  k ; j   should be the permutation that orresponds to   : : :   n  1  in reverse olex order when   = j and   = 0 for i 6= k , and this permutation  k  i  a  a  : : : a  is 0 1 : : :  k cid:0 j cid:0 1   k cid:0 j+1  : : :  k   k cid:0 j    k+1  : : :  n cid:0 1 . For exam-  0  1  n cid:0 1  ple, when n = 8 and   : : :   = 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 the orresponding reverse olex  n  1  permutation is 01345267, whih is  2 3 4 5  in yle form. When  cid:27  k ; j   is given  by  18 , Eqs.  15  and  16  lead to the formulas   cid:28   k ; j   =  k cid:0 j k  ;   19   ! k  =  0 1   0 1 2  : : :  0 1 : : : k  =  0 k   1 k cid:0 1   2 k cid:0 2  : : : =  cid:30  k ;   20   here  cid:30  k  is the \ k + 1 - cid:13 ip" that hanges a  : : : a  to a  : : : a  . In this ase ! k   0  k  k  0  turns out to be the same as ! k   , beause  cid:30  k   =   .   cid:0   2  Equations  19  and  20  are impliitly present behind the senes in Algo-  rithm L and in its reverse olex equivalent  exerise 2 , where step L3 essentially  applies a transposition and step L4 does a  cid:13 ip. Step G4 atually does the  cid:13 ip   cid:12 rst; but the identity   k cid:0 j k  cid:30  k  cid:0  1  =  cid:30  k  cid:0  1   j cid:0 1 k    21   shows that a  cid:13 ip followed by a transposition is the same as a  di cid:11 erent  trans-  position followed by the  cid:13 ip.  In fat, equation  21  is a speial ase of the important identity   cid:0    cid:0    cid:25    j  j  : : : j     cid:25  =  j   cid:25  j   cid:25  : : : j   cid:25  ;   22   1  2  t  1  2  t  whih is valid for any permutation  cid:25  and any t-yle  j  j  : : : j   . On the  1  2  t  left of  22  we have, for example, j   cid:25  7! j  7! j  7! j   cid:25  , in agreement with  1  1  2  2  the yle on the right. Therefore if  cid:11  and  cid:25  are any permutations whatsoever,  the permutation  cid:25    cid:11   cid:25   alled the onjugate of  cid:11  by  cid:25   has exatly the same  yle struture as  cid:11 ; we simply replae eah element j in eah yle by j  cid:25  .  Another signi cid:12 ant speial ase of Algorithm G was introdued by R. J.  Ord-Smith [CACM 10  1967 , 452; 12  1969 , 638; see also Comp. J. 14  1971 ,  12   7.2.1.2  GENERATING ALL PERMUTATIONS  13  136{139℄, whose algorithm is obtained by setting   cid:27  k ; j   =  k : : : 1 0   :   23   j  Now it is lear from  15  that  and one again we have   cid:28   k ; j   =  k : : : 1 0 ;   24   ! k  =  0 k   1 k cid:0 1   2 k cid:0 2  : : : =  cid:30  k ;   25   beause  cid:27  k ; k  =  0 1 : : : k  is the same as before. The nie thing about this  method is that the permutation needed in step G4, namely  cid:28   k ;     ! k  cid:0  1   ,  k   cid:0   does not depend on   :  k   cid:28   k ; j   ! k  cid:0  1   =  k : : : 1 0  cid:30  k  cid:0  1   =  cid:30  k :   26    cid:0    cid:0   Thus, Ord-Smith's algorithm is the speial ase of Algorithm G in whih step G4  simply interhanges a  $ a  , a  $ a  , : : : ; this operation is usually quik,  0  k  1  k cid:0 1  beause k is small, and it saves some of the work of Algorithm L.  See exerise 38  and the referene to G. S. Kl cid:127 ugel in Setion 7.2.1.7.   We an do even better by rigging things so that step G4 needs to do only a  single transposition eah time, somewhat as in Algorithm P but not neessarily  on adjaent elements. Many suh shemes are possible. The best is probably  to let   cid:28   k ; j   ! k  cid:0  1   =   27    cid:26    cid:0    k 0 ;  if k is even,   k j cid:0 1 ;  if k is odd,  as suggested by B. R. Heap [Comp. J. 6  1963 , 293{294℄. Notie that Heap's  method always transposes a  $ a  exept when k = 3, 5, : : : ; and the value of k ,  k  0  in 5 of every 6 steps, is either 1 or 2. Exerise 40 proves that Heap's method  does indeed generate all permutations.  Bypassing unwanted bloks. One noteworthy advantage of Algorithm G is  that it runs through all permutations of a  : : : a  before touhing a  ; then it  0  k cid:0 1  k  performs another k ! yles before hanging a  again, and so on. Therefore if at  k  any time we reah a setting of the  cid:12 nal elements a  : : : a  that is unimportant  k  n cid:0 1  to the problem we're working on, we an skip quikly over all permutations that  end with the undesirable suÆx. More preisely, we ould replae step G2 by the  following substeps:  step G2.2.  G2.0. [Aeptable?℄ If a  : : : a  is not an aeptable suÆx, go to G2.1.

Terminate if k = n; otherwise set  k        + 1, apply  cid:28   k ;     to a  : : : a  , and return to G2.0.  k  k  k  0  n cid:0 1  G2.2.

The algorithm has beome more ompliated, beause  13   14  COMBINATORIAL ALGORITHMS  F2B   7.2.1.2  we need to know the permutations  cid:28   k ; j   and  cid:27  k ; k  in addition to the permu-  tations  cid:28   k ; j   ! k  cid:0  1   that appear in G4. But the additional ompliations   cid:0   are often worth the e cid:11 ort, beause the resulting program might run signi cid:12 antly  faster.  0  1  2  3  00  01  02  10  11  12  30  31  32  010 011  020 021  100 101  120 121  300 301  310 311  320 321  Fig. 20. Unwanted branhes an be pruned from the  tree of Fig. 19, if Algorithm G is suitably extended.  For example, Fig. 20 shows what happens to the tree of Fig. 19 when  the suÆxes of a  a  a  a  that orrespond to nodes 00, 11, 121, and 2 are not  0  1  2  3  aeptable.  Eah suÆx a  : : : a  of the permutation a  : : : a  orresponds  k  n cid:0 1  0  n cid:0 1  to a pre cid:12 x   : : :   of the ontrol string   : : :   , beause the permutations  n  k  n  1   cid:27  1;     : : :  cid:27  k  cid:0  1;     do not a cid:11 et a  : : : a  .  Step G2.1 premultiplies by  1  k cid:0 1  k  n cid:0 1   cid:28   k ; j   to move from node   : : :   j to its right sibling   : : :    j+1 ,  n cid:0 1  k+1  n cid:0 1  k+1  and it premultiplies by  cid:27  k ; k   to move up from node   : : :   k to its  n cid:0 1  k+1   cid:0   parent   : : :   . Thus, to get from the rejeted pre cid:12 x 121 to its preorder  n cid:0 1  k+1  suessor, the algorithm premultiplies by  cid:27  1; 1   ,  cid:27  2; 2   , and  cid:28   3; 2 , thereby   cid:0    cid:0   moving from node 121 to 12 to 1 to 2.  This is a somewhat exeptional ase,  beause a pre cid:12 x with k = 1 is rejeted only if we don't want to visit the unique  permutation a  a  : : : a  that has suÆx a  : : : a  .  After node 2 is rejeted,  0  1  n cid:0 1  1  n cid:0 1   cid:28   3; 3  takes us to node 3, et.  Notie, inidentally, that bypassing a suÆx a  : : : a  in this extension  k  n cid:0 1  of Algorithm G is essentially the same as bypassing a pre cid:12 x a  : : : a  in our  1  j  original notation, if we go bak to the idea of generating permutations a  : : : a  1  n  of f1; : : : ; ng and doing most of the work at the right-hand end. Our original  notation orresponds to hoosing a   cid:12 rst, then a  , : : : , then a  ; the notation  1  2  n  in Algorithm G essentially hooses a   cid:12 rst, then a  , : : : , then a  . Algo-  n cid:0 1  n cid:0 2  0  rithm G's onventions may seem bakward, but they make the formulas for Sims  table manipulation a lot simpler. A good programmer soon learns to swith  without diÆulty from one viewpoint to another.  We an apply these ideas to alphametis, beause it is lear for example that  most hoies of the values for the letters D, E, and Y will make it impossible for  SEND plus MORE to equal MONEY: We need to have  D + E  cid:0  Y  mod 10 = 0 in that  problem. Therefore many permutations an be eliminated from onsideration.  In general, if r  is the maximum power of 10 that divides the signature  k  value s  , we an sort the letters and assign odes f0; 1; : : : ; 9g so that r   cid:21   k  0  r   cid:21   cid:1   cid:1   cid:1   cid:21  r  . For example, to solve the trio sonata problem  7 , we ould use  1  9   0; 1; : : : ; 9  respetively for  X; S; V; A; R; I; L; T; O; N , obtaining the signatures  s  = 0;  s  =  cid:0 100000;  s  = 210000;  s  =  cid:0 100;  s  =  cid:0 100;  0  1  2  3  4  s  = 21010;  s  = 210;  s  =  cid:0 1010;  s  =  cid:0 7901;  s  =  cid:0 998;  5  6  7  8  9  14   7.2.1.2  GENERATING ALL PERMUTATIONS  15  hene  r  ; : : : ; r    =  1; 5; 4; 2; 2; 1; 1; 1; 0; 0 . Now if we get to step G2.0 for a  0  9  value of k with r  6= r  , we an say that the suÆx a  : : : a  is unaeptable  k cid:0 1  k  k  9  unless a  s  +  cid:1   cid:1   cid:1  + a  s  is a multiple of 10  . Also,  10  tells us that a  : : : a  k  k  9  9  k  9  r  k cid:0 1  is unaeptable if a  = 0 and k 2 F ; the  cid:12 rst-letter set F is now f1; 2; 7g.  k  Our previous approah to alphametis with steps A1{A3 above used brute  fore to run through 10! possibilities. It operated rather fast under the irum-  stanes, sine the adjaent-transposition method allowed it to get by with only  6 memory referenes per permutation; but still, 10! is 3,628,800, so the entire  proess ost almost 22 megamems, regardless of the alphameti being solved.  By ontrast, the extended Algorithm G with Heap's method and the uto cid:11 s just  desribed will  cid:12 nd all four solutions to  7  with fewer than 128 kilomems! Thus  the suÆx-skipping tehnique runs more than 170 times faster than the previous  method, whih simply blasted away blindly.  Most of the 128 kilomems in the new approah are spent applying  cid:28   k ;      k  in step G2.1. The other memory referenes ome primarily from appliations of   cid:27  k ; k   in that step, but  cid:28  is needed 7812 times while  cid:27   is needed only 2162   cid:0    cid:0   times. The reason is easy to understand from Fig. 20, beause the \shortut  move"  cid:28   k ;     ! k  cid:0  1   in step G4 hardly ever applies; in this ase it is used  k   cid:0   only four times, one for eah solution. Thus, preorder traversal of the tree is  aomplished almost entirely by  cid:28  steps that move to the right and  cid:27   steps  that move upward. The  cid:28  steps dominate in a problem like this, where very   cid:0    cid:0   few omplete permutations are atually visited, beause eah step  cid:27  k ; k   is  preeded by k steps  cid:28   k ; 1 ,  cid:28   k ; 2 , : : : ,  cid:28   k ; k .  This analysis reveals that Heap's method  whih goes to great lengths to  optimize the permutations  cid:28   k ; j   ! k  cid:0  1   so that eah transition in step G4   cid:0   is a simple transposition  is not espeially good for the extended Algorithm G  unless omparatively few suÆxes are rejeted in step G2.0. The simpler reverse  olex order, for whih  cid:28   k ; j   itself is always a simple transposition, is now muh  more attrative  see  19  . Indeed, Algorithm G with reverse olex order solves  the alphameti  7  with only 97 kilomems.  Similar results our with respet to other alphameti problems. For ex-  ample, if we apply the extended Algorithm G to the alphametis in exerise 24,  parts  a  through  h , the omputations involve respetively   551, 110, 14, 8, 350, 84, 153, 1598  kilomems with Heap's method;   28    429, 84, 10, 5, 256, 63, 117, 1189  kilomems with reverse olex.  The speedup fator for reverse olex in these examples, ompared to brute fore  with Algorithm T, ranges from 18 in ase  h  to 4200 in ase  d , and it is about  80 on the average; Heap's method gives an average speedup of about 60.  We know from Algorithm L, however, that lexiographi order is easily han-  dled without the ompliation of the ontrol table   : : :   used by Algorithm G.  n  1  And a loser look at Algorithm L shows that we an improve its behavior when  permutations are frequently being skipped, by using a linked list instead of a  sequential array. The improved algorithm is well-suited to a wide variety of  algorithms that wish to generate restrited lasses of permutations:  15   16  COMBINATORIAL ALGORITHMS  F2B   7.2.1.2  Algorithm X  Lexiographi permutations with restrited pre cid:12 xes  .

If S  , : : : , S  is a Sims table for a permutation group G,  1  n cid:0 1  we learned in Lemma S that every element of G an be expressed uniquely as  a produt  cid:27   : : :  cid:27   , where  cid:27   2 S  ; see  13 .

If   = k , set     0, k   k  cid:0  1, and  0  1  n cid:0 1  k  k  repeat until k = 0 or   < k . Terminate the algorithm if k = 0 ; otherwise  k  set       + 1.  k  k  H4. [Permute.℄ Apply the permutation  cid:28   k ;     ! k + 1   to a  a  : : : a  , as  k  0  1  n cid:0 1   cid:0   explained below, and return to H2.  Although this algorithm looks almost idential to Algorithm G, the permutations   cid:28  and ! that it needs in step H4 are quite di cid:11 erent from those needed in step G4.  The new rules, whih replae  15  and  16 , are   cid:28   k ; j   =  cid:27  k ; j     cid:27  k ; j  cid:0  1 ;  for 1  cid:20  j  cid:20  k ;   34    cid:0   ! k  =  cid:27  n  cid:0  1; n  cid:0  1    cid:27  n  cid:0  2; n  cid:0  2   : : :  cid:27  k ; k   :   35    cid:0    cid:0    cid:0   The number of possibilities is just as vast as it was for Algorithm G, so we  will on cid:12 ne our attention to a few ases that have speial merit. One natural  ase to try is, of ourse, the Sims table that makes Algorithm G produe reverse  olex order, namely   cid:27  k ; j   =  k cid:0 j k cid:0 j+1 : : : k    36   as in  18 . The resulting permutation generator turns out to be very nearly the  same as the method of plain hanges; so we an say that Algorithms L and P  are essentially dual to eah other.  See exerise 52.   Another natural idea is to onstrut a Sims table for whih step H4 always  makes a single transposition of two elements, by analogy with the onstrution  of  27  that ahieves maximum eÆieny in step G4. But suh a mission now  turns out to be impossible: We annot ahieve it even when n = 4. For if  17   18  COMBINATORIAL ALGORITHMS  F2B   7.2.1.2  we start with the identity permutation a  a  a  a  = 0123, the transitions that  0  1  2  3  take us from ontrol table         = 0000 to 0001 to 0002 to 0003 must move  0  1  2  3  the 3; so, if they are transpositions, they must be  3 a ,  a b , and  b   for some  permutation ab of f0; 1; 2g. The permutation orresponding to         = 0003  0  1  2  3  is now  cid:27  3; 3   =  b    a b   3 a  =  3 a b  ; and the next permutation, whih   cid:0   orresponds to         = 0010, will be  cid:27  2; 1   , whih must  cid:12 x the element 3.  0  1  2  3   cid:0    cid:0   The only suitable transposition is  3  , hene  cid:27  2; 1   must be  3    3 a b   =   a b  . Similarly we  cid:12 nd that  cid:27  2; 2   must be  a  b , and the permutation   cid:0   orresponding to         = 0023 will be  3 a b    a  b  =  3  . Step H4 is now  0  1  2  3  supposed to onvert this to the permutation  cid:27  1; 1   , whih orresponds to the   cid:0   ontrol table 0100 that follows 0023. But the only transposition that will onvert   3   into a permutation that  cid:12 xes 2 and 3 is  3  ; and the resulting permutation  also  cid:12 xes 1, so it annot be  cid:27  1; 1   .   cid:0   The proof in the preeding paragraph shows that we annot use Algorithm H  to generate all permutations with the minimum number of transpositions. But it  also suggests a simple generation sheme that omes very lose to the minimum,  and the resulting algorithm is quite attrative beause it needs to do extra work  only one per n  n  cid:0  1  steps.  See exerise 53.   Finally, let's onsider the dual of Ord-Smith's method, when   cid:27  k ; j   =  k : : : 1 0    37   j  as in  23 . One again the value of  cid:28   k ; j   is independent of j ,   cid:28   k ; j   =  0 1 : : : k ;   38   and this fat is partiularly advantageous in Algorithm H beause it allows us  to dispense with the ontrol table     : : :   . The reason is that   = 0 in  0  1  n cid:0 1  n cid:0 1  step H3 if and only if a  = n  cid:0  1, beause of  32 ; and indeed, when   = 0  n cid:0 1  j  for k < j < n in step H3 we have   = 0 if and only if a  = k . Therefore we an  k  k  reformulate this variant of Algorithm H as follows.  Algorithm C  Permutation generation by yli shifts  .

This algorithm  may well be the simplest permutation generator of all, in terms of minimum  program length. It is due to G. G. Langdon, Jr. [CACM 10  1967 , 298{299;  11  1968 , 392℄; similar methods had been published previously by C. Tompkins  [Pro. Symp. Applied Math. 6  1956 , 202{205℄ and, more expliitly, by R. Seitz  [Unternehmensforshung 6  1962 , 2{15℄. The proedure is partiularly well  suited to appliations in whih yli shifting is eÆient, for example when su-  essive permutations are being kept in a mahine register instead of in an array.  The main disadvantage of dual methods is that they usually do not adapt  well to situations where large bloks of permutations need to be skipped, be-  ause the set of all permutations with a given value of the  cid:12 rst ontrol entries      : : :   is usually not of importane. The speial ase  36  is, however,  0  1  k cid:0 1  sometimes an exeption, beause the n!=k ! permutations with     : : :   =  0  1  k cid:0 1  00 : : : 0 in that ase are preisely those a  a  : : : a  in whih 0 preedes 1,  0  1  n cid:0 1  1 preedes 2, : : : , and k  cid:0  2 preedes k  cid:0  1.  *Ehrlih's swap method. Gideon Ehrlih has disovered a ompletely di cid:11 erent  approah to permutation generation, based on yet another way to use a ontrol  table   : : :   . His method obtains eah permutation from its predeessor by  1  n cid:0 1  interhanging the leftmost element with another:  Algorithm E  Ehrlih swaps  .

Notie that steps E2 and E3 are idential to steps G2 and G3 of Algorithm G.  The most amazing thing about this algorithm, whih Ehrlih ommuniated to  Martin Gardner in 1987, is that it works; exerise 55 ontains a proof. A similar  method, whih simpli cid:12 es the operations of step E5, an be validated in the same  way  see exerise 56 . The average number of interhanges performed in step E5  is less than 0.18  see exerise 57 .  As it stands, Algorithm E isn't faster than other methods we have seen. But  it has the nie property that it hanges eah permutation in a minimal way, using  only n  cid:0  1 di cid:11 erent kinds of transpositions. Whereas Algorithm P used adjaent  interhanges, a  $ a  , Algorithm E uses  cid:12 rst-element swaps, a  $ a  , also  t cid:0 1  t  0  t  alled star transpositions, for some well-hosen sequene of indies t[1℄, t[2℄, : : : ,  t[n!  cid:0  1℄. And if we are generating permutations repeatedly for the same fairly  small value of n, we an preompute this sequene, as we did in Algorithm T  19   20  COMBINATORIAL ALGORITHMS  F2B   7.2.1.2  for the index sequene of Algorithm P. Notie that star transpositions have an  advantage over adjaent interhanges, beause we always know the value of a  0  from the previous swap; we need not read it from memory.  Let E  be the sequene of n!  cid:0  1 indies t suh that Algorithm E swaps a  n  0  with a  in step E4.

After seeing Algorithms P and E, we might naturally  ask whether all permutations an be obtained by using just two basi operations,  instead of n  cid:0  1. For example, Nijenhuis and Wilf [Combinatorial Algorithms   1975 , Exerise 6℄ notied that all permutations an be generated for n = 4  if we replae a  a  a  : : : a  at eah step by either a  a  : : : a  a  or a  a  a  : : : a  ,  1  2  3  n  2  3  n  1  2  1  3  n  and they wondered whether suh a method exists for all n.  In general, if G is any group of permutations and if  cid:11   , : : : ,  cid:11   are ele-  1  k  ments of G, the Cayley graph for G with generators   cid:11   ; : : : ;  cid:11     is the direted  1  k  graph whose verties are the permutations  cid:25  of G and whose ars go from  cid:25   to  cid:11    cid:25  , : : : ,  cid:11    cid:25  .  [Arthur Cayley, Amerian J. Math. 1  1878 , 174{176.℄ The  1  k  question of Nijenhuis and Wilf is equivalent to asking whether the Cayley graph  for all permutations of f1; 2; : : : ; ng, with generators  cid:27  and  cid:28  where  cid:27  is the yli  permutation  1 2 : : : n  and  cid:28  is the transposition  1 2 , has a Hamiltonian path.  A basi theorem due to R. A. Rankin [Pro. Cambridge Philos.

Proof. See exerise 73.  In partiular, when  cid:11  =  cid:27  and  cid:12  =  cid:28  as above, we have g = n!, a = n, b = 2, and   = n  cid:0  1, beause  cid:27   cid:28   =  2 : : : n . Therefore we onlude that no Hamiltonian   cid:0   yle is possible when n  cid:21  4 is even. However, a Hamiltonian path is easy to  20   7.2.1.2  GENERATING ALL PERMUTATIONS  21  onstrut when n = 4, beause we an join up the 12-yles  1234 ! 2341 ! 3412 ! 4312 ! 3124 ! 1243 ! 2431  ! 4231 ! 2314 ! 3142 ! 1423 ! 4123 ! 1234;   41   2134 ! 1342 ! 3421 ! 4321 ! 3214 ! 2143 ! 1432  ! 4132 ! 1324 ! 3241 ! 2413 ! 4213 ! 2134;  by starting at 2341 and jumping from 1234 to 2134, ending at 4213.  Ruskey, Jiang, and Weston [Disrete Applied Math. 57  1995 , 75{83℄ un-  dertook an exhaustive searh in the  cid:27 { cid:28  graph for n = 5 and disovered that  it has  cid:12 ve essentially distint Hamiltonian yles, one of whih  the \most  beautiful"  is illustrated in Fig. 22 a . They also found a Hamiltonian path  for n = 6; this was a diÆult feat, beause it is the outome of a 720-stage  binary deision tree. Unfortunately the solution they disovered has no apparent  logial struture. A somewhat less omplex path is desribed in exerise 70, but  even that path annot be alled simple. Therefore a  cid:27 { cid:28  approah will probably  not be of pratial interest for larger values of n unless a new onstrution  is disovered. R. C. Compton and S. G. Williamson [Linear and Multilinear  Algebra 35  1993 , 237{293℄ have proved that Hamiltonian yles exist for all n  if the three generators  cid:27  ,  cid:27   , and  cid:28  are allowed instead of just  cid:27  and  cid:28  ; their   cid:0   yles have the interesting property that every nth transformation is  cid:28  , and the  intervening n  cid:0  1 transformations are either all  cid:27  or all  cid:27   . But their method is   cid:0   too ompliated to explain in a short spae.

This question  has often been raised in omputer publiations, beause people who examine n!  possibilities want to keep the running time as small as possible. But the answers  have generally been ontraditory, beause there are many di cid:11 erent ways to  formulate the question. Let's try to understand the related issues by studying  how permutations might be generated most rapidly on the MMIX omputer.  Suppose  cid:12 rst that our goal is to produe permutations in an array of n  onseutive memory words  otabytes . The fastest way to do this, of all those  we've seen in this setion, is to streamline Heap's method  27 , as suggested by  R. Sedgewik [Computing Surveys 9  1977 , 157{160℄.  21   22  COMBINATORIAL ALGORITHMS  F2B   7.2.1.2  The key idea is to optimize the ode for the most ommon ases of steps G2  and G3, namely the ases in whih all ativity ours at the beginning of the  array. If registers u, v , and w ontain the ontents of the  cid:12 rst three words, and  if the next six permutations to be generated involve permuting those words in  all six possible ways, we an learly do the job as follows:  PUSHJ 0,Visit  STO v,A0;  STO u,A1;  PUSHJ 0,Visit  STO w,A0;  STO v,A2;  PUSHJ 0,Visit  STO u,A0;  STO w,A1;  PUSHJ 0,Visit   42   STO v,A0;  STO u,A2;  PUSHJ 0,Visit  STO w,A0;  STO v,A1;  PUSHJ 0,Visit   Here A0 is the address of otabyte a  , et.  A omplete permutation program,  0  whih takes are of getting the right things into u, v , and w, appears in exer-  ise 77, but the other instrutions are less important beause they need to be  performed only  of the time. The total ost per permutation, not ounting the  1  6  4 cid:29  needed for PUSHJ and POP on eah all to Visit, omes to approximately  2:77 cid:22  + 5:69 cid:29  with this approah.  If we use four registers u, v , w, x, and if  we expand  42  to 24 alls on Visit, the running time per permutation drops  to about 2:19 cid:22  + 3:07 cid:29  . And with r registers and r ! Visits, exerise 78 shows  that the ost is  2 + O 1=r !    cid:22  +  cid:29  , whih is very nearly the ost of two STO  instrutions.  The latter is, of ourse, the minimum possible time for any method that  generates all permutations in a sequential array. : : : Or is it? We have assumed  that the visiting routine wants to see permutations in onseutive loations, but  perhaps that routine is able to read the permutations from di cid:11 erent starting  points. Then we an arrange to keep a   cid:12 xed and to keep two opies of the  n cid:0 1  other elements in its viinity:  a  a  : : : a  a  a  a  : : : a  :   43   0  1  n cid:0 2  n cid:0 1  0  1  n cid:0 2  If we now let a  a  : : : a  run through  n  cid:0  1 ! permutations, always hanging  0  1  n cid:0 2  both opies simultaneously by doing two STO ommands instead of one, we an  let every all to Visit look at the n permutations  a  a  : : : a  ;  a  : : : a  a  ;  : : : ;  a  a  : : : a  ;   44   0  1  n cid:0 1  1  n cid:0 1  0  n cid:0 1  0  n cid:0 2  whih all appear onseutively. The ost per permutation is now redued to the  ost of three simple instrutions like ADD, CMP, PBNZ, plus O 1=n .  [See Varol  and Rotem, Comp. J. 24  1981 , 173{176.℄  Furthermore, we might not want to waste time storing permutations into  memory at all. Suppose, for example, that our goal is to generate all permuta-  tions of f0; 1; : : : ; n  cid:0  1g. The value of n will probably be at most 16, beause  16! = 20;922;789;888;000 and 17! = 355;687;428;096;000. Therefore an entire  permutation will  cid:12 t in the 16 nybbles of an otabyte, and we an keep it in a  single register. This will be advantageous only if the visiting routine doesn't  need to unpak the individual nybbles; but let's suppose that it doesn't. How  fast an we generate permutations in the nybbles of a 64-bit register?  22   7.2.1.2  GENERATING ALL PERMUTATIONS  23  One idea, suggested by a tehnique due to A. J. Goldstein [U. S. Patent  3383661  14 May 1968 ℄, is to preompute the table  t[1℄; : : : ; t[5039℄  of plain-  hange transitions for seven elements, using Algorithm T. These numbers t[k ℄ lie  between 1 and 6, so we an pak 20 of them into a 64-bit word. It is onvenient  to put the number  2  t[20j + k ℄ into word j of an auxiliary table, for  P  20  3k cid:0 1  k=1  0  cid:20  j < 252, with t[5040℄ = 1; for example, the table begins with the odeword  00j001j010j011j100j101j110j100j110j101j100j011j010j001j110j001j010j011j100j101j110j00:  The following program reads suh odes eÆiently:  Perm  h Set register a to the  cid:12 rst permutation i  0H  LDA  p,T  p   address of  cid:12 rst odeword.

Therefore the  ost per permutation is just a bit more than 10 cid:29  .  The instrutions that feth  new odewords ost only   cid:22  + 5 cid:29  =20 ; and the instrutions that advane the  leading n cid:0  7 nybbles are even more negligible sine their ost is divided by 5040.   Notie that there is now no need for PUSHJ and POP as there was with  42 ; we  ignored those instrutions before, but they did ost 4 cid:29  .  We an, however, do even better by adapting Langdon's yli-shift method,  Algorithm C. Suppose we start with the lexiographially largest permutation  and operate as follows:  GREG   JMP  2F  0H  OCTA fedba9876543210& 1<< 4*N -1   Perm  LDOU a,0B  Set a    : : : 3210 .    16 cid:0 n  1H  SRU  a,a,4* 16-N   a   ba=16  .

See exerise 81 for an interesting way to extend  46  to  a omplete program, obtaining a remarkably short and fast routine.  23   24  COMBINATORIAL ALGORITHMS  F2B   7.2.1.2  Fast permutation generators are amusing, but in pratie we an usually  save more time by streamlining the visiting routine than by speeding up the  generator.  namely  Topologial sorting. Instead of working with all n! permutations of f1; : : : ; ng,  we often want to look only at permutations that obey ertain restritions. For  example, we might be interested only in permutations for whih 1 preedes 3,  2 preedes 3, and 2 preedes 4; there are  cid:12 ve suh permutations of f1; 2; 3; 4g,  1234; 1243; 2134; 2143; 2413:   47   The problem of topologial sorting, whih we studied in Setion 2.2.3 as a  cid:12 rst  example of nontrivial data strutures, is the general problem of  cid:12 nding a permu-  tation that satis cid:12 es m suh onditions x   cid:30  y  , : : : , x   cid:30  y  , where x  cid:30  y means  1  1  m  m  that x should preede y in the permutation. This problem arises frequently in  pratie, so it has several di cid:11 erent names; for example, it is often alled the linear  embedding problem, beause we want to arrange ob jets in a line while preserving  ertain order relationships. It is also the problem of extending a partial ordering  to a total ordering  see exerise 2.2.3{14 .  Our goal in Setion 2.2.3 was to  cid:12 nd a single permutation that satis cid:12 es  all the relations. But now we want rather to  cid:12 nd al l suh permutations, all  topologial sorts. Indeed, we will assume in the present setion that the elements  x and y on whih the relations are de cid:12 ned are integers between 1 and n, and  that we have x < y whenever x  cid:30  y . Consequently the permutation 12 : : : n  will always be topologially orret.  If this simplifying assumption is not met,  we an preproess the data by using Algorithm 2.2.3T to rename the ob jets  appropriately.   Many important lasses of permutations are speial ases of this topologial  ordering problem. For example, the permutations of f1; : : : ; 8g suh that  1  cid:30  2;  2  cid:30  3;  3  cid:30  4;  6  cid:30  7;  7  cid:30  8  are equivalent to permutations of the multiset f1; 1; 1; 1; 2; 3; 3; 3g, beause we  an map f1; 2; 3; 4g 7! 1, 5 7! 2, and f6; 7; 8g 7! 3. We know how to generate  permutations of a multiset using Algorithm L, but now we will learn another way.  Notie that x preedes y in a permutation a  : : : a  if and only if a  < a  in  1  n  x  y  0  0  the inverse permutation a  : : : a  . Therefore the algorithm we are about to study  0  0  1  n  will also  cid:12 nd all permutations a  : : : a  suh that a  < a  whenever j  cid:30  k . For  0  0  0  0  1  n  j  k  example, we learned in Setion 5.1.4 that a Young tableau is an arrangement of  f1; : : : ; ng in rows and olumns so that eah row is inreasing from left to right  and eah olumn is inreasing from top to bottom. The problem of generating all  3  cid:2  3 Young tableaux is therefore equivalent to generating all a  : : : a  suh that  0  0  1  9  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  a  < a  < a  ;  a  < a  < a  ;  a  < a  < a  ;  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  a  < a  < a  ;  a  < a  < a  ;  a  < a  < a  ;  1  4  7  2  5  8  3  6  9   48   and this is a speial kind of topologial sorting.  24   7.2.1.2  GENERATING ALL PERMUTATIONS  25  We might also want to  cid:12 nd all mathings of 2n elements, namely all ways to  partition f1; : : : ; 2ng into n pairs. There are  2n cid:0 1  2n cid:0 3  : : :  1  =  2n != 2  n!   n  ways to do this, and they orrespond to permutations that satisfy  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  a  < a  ;  a  < a  ;  : : : ;  a  < a  ;  a  < a  <  cid:1   cid:1   cid:1  < a  :   49   1  2  3  4  2n cid:0 1  2n  1  3  2n cid:0 1  An elegant algorithm for exhaustive topologial sorting was disovered by  Y. L. Varol and D. Rotem [Comp. J. 24  1981 , 83{84℄, who realized that a  method analogous to plain hanges  Algorithm P  an be used. Suppose we  have found a way to arrange f1; : : : ; n  cid:0  1g topologially, so that a  : : : a  1  n cid:0 1  satis cid:12 es all the onditions that do not involve n. Then we an easily write down  all the allowable ways to insert the  cid:12 nal element n without hanging the relative  order of a  : : : a  : We simply start with a  : : : a  n, then shift n left one step  1  n cid:0 1  1  n cid:0 1  at a time, until it annot move further. Applying this idea reursively yields the  following straightforward proedure.  Algorithm V  Al l topologial sorts  . Given a relation  cid:30  on f1; : : : ; ng with the  property that x  cid:30  y implies x < y , this algorithm generates all permutations  a  : : : a  and their inverses a  : : : a  with the property that a  < a  whenever  1  n  1  n  j  k  0  0  0  0  j  cid:30  k .

Equivalently, t  is the number  j  r  of topologial sorts a  : : : a  of f1; : : : ; rg, when we ignore the relations involving  1  r  elements greater than r . Then the reursive mehanism underlying Algorithm V  shows that step V2 is performed N times and step V3 is performed M times,  where  M = t  +  cid:1   cid:1   cid:1  + t  and  N = t  :   51   n  1  n  Also, step V4 and the loop operations of V5 are performed N  cid:0  1 times; the rest  of step V5 is done M  cid:0  N + 1 times. Therefore the total running time of the  algorithm is a linear ombination of M , N , and n.  If the element labels are hosen poorly, M might be muh larger than N .  For example, if the onstraints input to Algorithm V are  2  cid:30  3;  3  cid:30  4;  : : : ; n  cid:0  1  cid:30  n;   52   then t  = j for 1  cid:20  j  cid:20  n and we have M =   n  + n , N = n. But those  j  1  2  2  onstraints are also equivalent to  1  cid:30  2;  2  cid:30  3;  : : : ; n  cid:0  2  cid:30  n  cid:0  1;   53   under renaming of the elements; then M is redued to 2n  cid:0  1 = 2N  cid:0  1.  Exerise 89 shows that a simple preproessing step will  cid:12 nd element labels  so that a slight modi cid:12 ation of Algorithm V is able to generate all topologial  sorts in O N + n  steps. Thus topologial sorting an always be done eÆiently.  Think twie before you permute. We have seen several attrative algorithms  for permutation generation in this setion, but many algorithms are known by  whih permutations that are optimum for partiular purposes an be found  without running through all possibilities. For example, Theorem 6.1S showed  that we an  cid:12 nd the best way to arrange reords on a sequential storage simply  by sorting them with respet to a ertain ost riterion, and this proess takes  only O n log n  steps. In Setion 7.5.2 we will study the assignment problem,  whih asks how to permute the olumns of a square matrix so that the sum of  the diagonal elements is maximized. That problem an be solved in at most  3  O n    operations, so it would be foolish to use a method of order n! unless n  is extremely small. Even in ases like the traveling salesrep problem, when no  eÆient algorithm is known, we an usually  cid:12 nd a muh better approah than  to examine every possible solution. Permutation generation is best used when  there is good reason to look at eah permutation individually.  EXERCISES  when the value of j is near n.  x 1.

We may assume that r < n. Algorithm G will generate r-variations for any Sims  table if we simply hange `k   1' to `k   n  cid:0  r' in step G3, provided that we rede cid:12 ne  ! k  to be  cid:27  n  cid:0  r; n  cid:0  r  : : :  cid:27  k; k  instead of using  16 .  If n  cid:0  r is odd, the method of  27  is still valid, although the formulas in answer 40  need to be revised when k < n  cid:0  r + 2. The new formulas are  cid:27  k; j   =  k j cid:0 1 : : : 1 0   and ! k  =  k : : : 1 0  when k = n  cid:0  r;  cid:27  k; j   =  k : : : 1 0   when k = n  cid:0  r + 1.  If n  cid:0  r is even, we an use  27  with even and odd reversed, if r  cid:20  3. But when  r  cid:21  4 a more omplex sheme is needed, beause a  cid:12 xed transposition like  k 0  an  be used for odd k only if ! k  cid:0  1  is a k-yle, whih means that ! k  cid:0  1  must be an  even permutation; but ! k  is odd for k  cid:21  n  cid:0  r + 2.  The following sheme works when n  cid:0  r is even: Let  cid:28   k; j   ! k  cid:0  1   =  k k cid:0 j     cid:0   for 1  cid:20  j  cid:20  k = n  cid:0  r, and use  27  when k > n  cid:0  r. Then, when k = n  cid:0  r + 1, we have  ! k  cid:0  1  =  0 1 : : : k cid:0 1 , hene  cid:27  k; j   takes k 7!  2j  cid:0  1  mod k for 1  cid:20  j  cid:20  k, and   cid:27  k; k  =  k k cid:0 1 k cid:0 3 : : : 0 k cid:0 2 : : : 1 , ! k  =  k : : : 1 0 ,  cid:27  k + 1; j   =  k+1 : : : 0   .  j  42. If  cid:27  k; j   =  k j cid:0 1  we have  cid:28   k; 1  =  k 0  and  cid:28   k; j   =  k j cid:0 1   k j cid:0 2  =   k j cid:0 1 j cid:0 2  for 2  cid:20  j  cid:20  k.  43.

The permutation orresponding to ontrol table    : : :   in Algorithm H has   elements to the right of j that are less than j ,  0  n cid:0 1  j  for 0  cid:20  j < n; so it is the same as the permutation orresponding to   : : :   in  1  n  Algorithm P, exept that subsripts are shifted by 1.  The only essential di cid:11 erene between Algorithm P and this version of Algorithm H  is that Algorithm P uses a re cid:13 eted Gray ode to run through all possibilities of its  ontrol table, while Algorithm H runs through those mixed-radix numbers in asending   lexiographi  order.  Indeed, Gray ode an be used with any Sims table, by modifying either Algo-  rithm G or Algorithm H. Then all transitions are by  cid:28   k; j   or by  cid:28   k; j    , and the   cid:0   permutations ! k  are irrelevant.  53.

Brendan MKay and Frank Ruskey have found suh yles by omputer when  n = 7, 9, and 11, but no nie struture was apparent.  72. Any Hamiltonian path inludes  n  cid:0  1 ! verties that take y 7! x, eah of whih  if  not the last  is followed by a vertex that takes x 7! x. So one must be last; otherwise   n  cid:0  1 ! + 1 verties would take x 7! x.  73.  a  Assume  cid:12 rst that  cid:12  is the identity permutation   . Then every yle of  cid:11  that  ontains an element of A lies entirely within A. Hene the yles of  cid:27  are obtained by  omitting all yles of  cid:11  that ontain no element of A. All remaining yles have odd  length, so  cid:27  is an even permutation.  If  cid:12  is not the identity, we apply this argument to  cid:11   =  cid:11  cid:12   ,  cid:12   =   , and  cid:27   =  cid:27  cid:12   ,  0   cid:0   0  0   cid:0   onluding that  cid:27   is an even permutation; thus  cid:27  and  cid:12  have the same sign.  0  Similarly,  cid:27  and  cid:11  have the same sign, beause  cid:12  cid:11   =   cid:11  cid:12      has the same order   cid:0    cid:0    cid:0   as  cid:11  cid:12   .   cid:0    b  Let X be the verties of the Cayley graph in Theorem R, and let  cid:11  be the  permutation of X that takes a vertex  cid:25  into  cid:11  cid:25  ; this permutation has g=a yles of  length a. De cid:12 ne the permutation  cid:12  similarly. Then  cid:11  cid:12   has g= yles of length .   cid:0   If  is odd, any Hamiltonian yle in the graph de cid:12 nes a yle  cid:27  that ontains all the  verties and satis cid:12 es the hypotheses of  a . Therefore  cid:11  and  cid:12  have an odd number of  yles, beause the sign of a permutation on n elements with r yles is   cid:0 1    see  n cid:0 r  exerise 5.2.2{2 .  [This proof, whih shows that X annot be the union of any odd number of yles,  was presented by Rankin in Pro. Cambridge Phil. So. 62  1966 , 15{16.℄  74. The representation  cid:12    cid:13   is unique if we require 0  cid:20  j < g= and 0  cid:20  k < . For  j  k  j  k  if we had  cid:12   =  cid:13   for some j with 0 < j < g=, the group would have at most j   elements. It follows that  cid:12   =  cid:13   for some t.  g=  t  Let  cid:27  be a Hamiltonian yle, as in the previous answer. If x cid:27  = x cid:11  then x cid:13   cid:27   must be x cid:13  cid:11 , beause x cid:13   cid:12  =  cid:11 . And if x cid:27  = x cid:12  then x cid:13   cid:27  annot be x cid:13  cid:11 , beause  that would imply x cid:13    cid:27  = x cid:13    cid:11 . Thus the elements x cid:13   all have equivalent behavior      k  with respet to their suessors in  cid:27  .  Notie that if j  cid:21  0 there is a k  cid:20  j suh that x cid:27   = x cid:11    cid:12   = x cid:12    cid:13   . Therefore  j  k  j cid:0 k  j  k  g=  t+k  x cid:27   = x cid:13   is equivalent to x, and the same behavior will repeat. We return to x  for the  cid:12 rst time in g steps if and only if t + k is relatively prime to .  75. Apply the previous exerise with g = mn, a = m, b = n,  = mn=d. The number t  satis cid:12 es t  cid:17  0  modulo m , t + d  cid:17  0  modulo n ; and it follows that k + t ?  if and  only if  d  cid:0  k m=d ? kn=d.  Notes: The modular Gray ode of exerise 7.2.1.1{78 is a Hamiltonian path from   0; 0  to  m  cid:0  1;   cid:0 m  mod n , so it is a Hamiltonian yle if and only if m is a multiple  of n.  It is natural to onjeture  falsely  that at least one Hamiltonian yle exists  whenever d > 1. But P. Erd}os and W. T. Trotter have observed [J.

Some positions  like 6 cid:3  cid:3 213 for n = 6  have no predeessors, even though we  haven't turned all the ards up. It is easy to explore the tree of potential bakwards  games systematially, and one an in fat show that the number of nodes with t  cid:3 's is  exatly  n  cid:0  1 !=t!. Hene the total number of nodes onsidered is exatly b n  cid:0  1 ! e.  When n = 13 this is 1,302,061,345.  The better one is to play forwards, starting with initial position  cid:3  : : :  cid:3  and turning  over the top ard when it is fae down, running through all  n  cid:0  1 ! permutations of  f2; : : : ; ng as ards are turned.  If the bottom n  cid:0  m ards are known to be equal  to  m+1  m+2  : : : n, in that order, at most f  m  further moves are possible; thus we  need not pursue a line of play any further if it annot last long enough to be interesting.  A permutation generator like Algorithm X allows us to share the omputation for all  permutations with the same pre cid:12 x and to rejet unimportant pre cid:12 xes. The ard in posi-  tion j need not take the value j when it is turned.

Although it repeats some lines of play, the early uto cid:11 s  of unpro cid:12 table branhes make it run more than 11 times faster than the bakward  method when n = 13.

The unique longest-winded permutation for n = 16 is  9 12 6 7 2 14 8 1 11 13 5 4 15 16 10 3:  109. The forward method of answer 107 suggests that f  n  probably grows at least  as fast as n log n  by omparison with oupon olleting .  110.

Then the number of j suh that A  = v must equal the number  1  m  j  of k suh that B  = v , for all bit vetors v . And if so, the values fa  j A  = vg should  k  j  j  be assigned to permutations of fk j B  = vg in all possible ways.  k  For example, the bit vetors in the given problem are   A  ; : : : ; A    =  9; 6; 8; b; 5; 4; 0; a; 2; 0 ;   B  ; : : : ; B    =  5; 0; 8; 6; 2; a; 4; b; 9; 0 ;  0  9  0  9  in hexadeimal notation; hene a  : : : a  = 8327061549 or 8327069541.  0  9  In a larger problem we would keep the bit vetors in a hash table. It would be  better to give the answer in terms of equivalene lasses, not permutations; indeed, this  problem has omparatively little to do with permutations.  111.
