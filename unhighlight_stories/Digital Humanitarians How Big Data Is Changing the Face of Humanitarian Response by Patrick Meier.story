Patrick Meier is a passionate evangelist for the power of big data to help us respond to  natural disasters and other crises. He is also a careful scholar who thinks deeply about  the limits and potential dangers of data-centric approaches. His book oἀers both inspi- ration for those around the world who want to improve our disaster response and a set  of fertile challenges to ensure we use data wisely and ethically.  —Ethan Zuckerman, Director, MIT Center for Civic Media and author of  Rewire: Digital Cosmopolitans in the Age of Connection  I dare you to read this book and not have both your heart and mind opened. Patrick  Meier writes compellingly about his first-hand accounts of people around the world  working together to help disaster victims through advanced computing solutions.   —Leysia Palen, Associate Professor and Director of Project EPIC—Empowering  the Public with Information during Crises, University of Colorado, Boulder  Something very like the fog of war afflicts crisis response. On the ground, simply know- ing what is wrong—who is suἀering? where is the danger?—is both critical and difficult.  In Digital Humanitarians, Patrick Meier, a scholar and practitioner of crisis response,  shows us how simple digital tools, built and staἀed by a worldwide network of volun- teers, are providing faster and more comprehensive data for disaster response eἀorts.  Working from examples like the Haitian earthquake and the Arab Spring, Meier shows  how tools from artificial intelligence to aerial drones, and techniques from crowdmap- ping to distributed fact-checking, are helping to dispel some of that fog.  —Clay Shirky, Associate Professor, Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute,   New York University, and author of Here Comes Everybody: The Power  of Organizing Without Organizations  An insider’s guide to the humanitarian data revolution, seen through the eyes of a  thought leader, scholar, and expert practitioner on the front lines of a global movement  that is already transforming how we understand and respond to crises.  —Robert Kirkpatrick, Director of United Nations Global Pulse  Business, economics, and governance are transforming as traditional state-based institu- tions are supplemented and indeed eclipsed by non-state networks of civil society. New  technologies are enabling regular citizens to connect, collaborate, and save lives. In his  book, Meier shows these same trends emerging in the field of humanitarian response.  Global problem solving is rapidly evolving and Meier will help get you on board.  —Don Tapscott, Global Solutions Network and co-author of Wikinomics  This book breaks new ground as Patrick Meier charts the optimism, the possibilities,  and the dilemmas of a new Digital Humanitarianism from his own first-hand experi- ence. For anyone in the Humanitarian sector—ignore this book at your peril.  —Tarun Sarwal, Innovation Advisor, International Committee  of the Red Cross  ICRC    Meier oἀers an illuminating look at how digital humanitarian have been creating value  from big data for nearly a half-decade. He changes the narrative surrounding the “tradi- tional” humanitarian community—often thought to be intransigent and inflexible—by  presenting examples of how humanitarian organizations are actively exploring how  to incorporate big data and crowdsourcing into their decision-making processes. His  authoritative volume crackles with honest insights about the current and future state of  humanitarian response.  —Albert Gembara, Technology Integration Officer, United States Agency  for International Development  USAID   Patrick Meier has been the leading figure in creating a new type of disaster responders,  digital humanitarians, and in this groundbreaking book he takes us through the story  of how technology can truly revolutionize how we deal with some of the most chaotic  events we experience.  —Gisli Olafsson, Emergency Response Director, NetHope,   and author of The Crisis Leader  For all the technology firsts, this is first a story about volunteers. It is also a story about the  relentless application of fundamental information technology skills, collecting, process- ing, and making understandable an avalanche of data. Not only is this about the heart of  information technology professionals, it is about the application of information technol- ogy skills; and in a crisis, any professionals want to contribute what they know best.  —Ed Happ, Global Chief Information Office  CIO  of the International  Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies  IFRC   This book is deeply relevant and astonishingly up to date. No surprise—Patrick Meier  has been the heartbeat of digital humanitarianism long before the phrase was coined  and only he could have written this account. In the early days  7–8 years ago , there were  mappers and humanitarians. Patrick began writing his blog; more people from both  camps began to talk to each other. And then the Haiti earthquake struck in January  2010. From that instant the story takes oἀ. Beginning with what can be accomplished by  the dedication and talent of circles of friends and alert strangers—mapping the streets of  Port au Prince and finding trapped victims based on their tweets—this book traces the  explosion in crisis response analytics that has created the universe of digital humani- tarianism. Eminently readable and packed with details and insights, this book presents  and explains a phenomenon that is still in its early stages. It deals with the potential of  Big Data, issues of security and reliability, the role of artificial intelligence, and invites  the reader to participate in an enterprise that is already changing the ways that govern- ments, agencies, groups, and individuals understand and respond to crises of disaster  and forced migration from war. Every consumer of world news and everyone living in  a potential disaster zone must read this book to see how globalized digital sets of net- works—and the volunteers behind them—are transforming our capacities to help locate,  talk to, rescue, and sustain people trapped in the major calamities of our time.  —Jennifer Leaning, Professor at Harvard University’s School of Public Health  and Director of Harvard University’s FXB Center for Health and Human Rights   Patrick Meier’s new book is extraordinarily timely, providing practitioners and policy  makers with an accessible guide to how digital technology can help to improve humani- tarian outcomes.   —Joanna Macrae, Head of Humanitarian Innovation Programme,  Department for International Development  DFID   If you want to be enlightened about how technology is revolutionizing humanitarian  aid, then this book is for you. In Digital Humanitarians Patrick Meier depicts a humani- tarian endeavor that is being enriched by the eἀorts of a growing global network of  smart, savvy innovators. Expertly fusing front-line experience, technological expertise,  and a deeply humane worldview, Meier closes with a rousing call for change: toward a  more open, democratic humanitarian system. All of us working in international disaster  response should be paying close attention.  —Ben Ramalingam, Chair of the Humanitarian Innovation Fund  HIF   and author of Aid on the Edge of Chaos  This book shows us once again why Patrick Meier is a thought leader in leveraging emerg- ing  technologies  for  social  impact.  His  book  captures  the  enormous  possibilities  and  avoidable pitfalls of big data, social media, and artificial intelligence in crisis contexts.  Digital  humanitarians  can  be  powerful  agents  for  social  change  but  ground-truthing  what we see and hear digitally is more important than ever.  —Aleem Walji, Chief Innovation Advisor, Leadership, Learning,  and Innovation, World Bank Group  Patrick Meier is a master cartographer. He is a talented crisis mapper, sure, but he’s  mapping something even bigger in this book. He’s mapping the ecosystem of digital  humanitarianism—the hills of human motivations, the seas of human institutions, and  the urban landscape of human technology. The ideas and stories here not only plot the  path for digital humanitarians in disasters, but they illuminate a runway of opportunity  for all of philanthropy and social innovation in the digital age.  —Wendy Harman, Director of Information Management and Situational  Awareness, American Red Cross  There has been a lot of hype about the role technology can play in the humanitarian  space, with very little to show for it. Patrick Meier—in his book and in his work—is one  of the few people who has gone beyond talk to show how big ideas can translate into  very concrete initiatives that help save lives. He also shows a fascinating glimpse into the  early days of crisis mapping and the passionate group of volunteers who are transform- ing the way we work. This book is indispensable reading for anyone who is interested in  finding ways to incorporate technology into their work as humanitarians.  —Sharon Morris, Senior Advisor to the President, US Institute of Peace  USIP   Patrick provides a fascinating read for anyone interested in how technology could spur  the humanitarian community far into the 21st century. Building from his very personal    experience that propelled him into the digital humanitarian space, Patrick lays out the  amazing achievements of many who have dreamed to change the world for the better. At  the same time, and perhaps more importantly, Patrick also outlines what the humani- tarian community can do to fully embrace new technologies and approaches—many of  which are already revolutionizing other industries.  —Andrej Verity, Cofounder of Digital Humanitarian Network  Patrick Meier is not your stereotypical explorer, but in many respects he is the quin- tessential explorer. He is determined to scale and tame the peaks of Big Data that are  rising unrelentingly around us in the form of social media, satellite imagery and other  information. Constantly researching and analyzing successful problem-solving applica- tions and models in cross-disciplinary fields like digital archaeology and conservation  technology, Patrick is exploring new frontiers, applying innovative tools and method- ologies to test and refine solutions to big humanitarian problems. Any digital explorer  interested in better understanding the combined power of collective and artificial intel- ligence should read Digital Humanitarians.  —Alex Moen, Vice President, Strategic Initiative and Explorers Program,  National Geographic  Patrick Meier’s brilliant and inspiring book documents the power that everyday  citizens have when responding to humanitarian crises or political repression. Patrick  writes from the unique perspective of having played a key role in the development and  evolution of the digital humanitarian field. The book provides a wonderful combina- tion of case studies exploring many successes and challenges and also has a critical  and necessary exploration of the many ethical issues around the use of technology in  humanitarian work, such as privacy, safety, power, and agency. This book is a must read  for students, faculty, policymakers, activists, simply anyone who is engaged or seeking  to engage in technology for social change.  —Craig Zelizer, Professor at Georgetown University and Associate Director  of Conflict Resolution Program  In this definitive and often gripping account, Patrick Meier traces the rise of a new gen- eration of global humanitarians who are using social media, satellite, and aerial drone  imagery, microtasking, big data, and other digital tools to respond to natural disasters  and political humanitarian crises. A leader himself in the eἀorts to develop and network  digital tools for social good, Meier shows how technology, idealism, and global social net- working are rapidly coevolving to empower local actors and enhance the world’s ability  to respond to complex emergencies. This is a fascinating, important, and deeply hopeful  book about the way digital tools are facilitating and transforming global cooperation.  —Larry Diamond, Director, Center on Democracy, Development, and the  Rule of Law  CDDRL , Stanford University  Intelligent, well-written, and inspiring, Digital Humanitarians oἀers an agenda for how  the world can use technology to transform the lives of people in crisis. It combines a rare    understanding of the state-of-the-art in innovation and technology with sensitivity to  the most pressing global challenges. It should be read by anyone who cares about our  common future.  —Alexander Betts, Associate Professor and Director of the Humanitarian  Innovation Project, University of Oxford  Patrick Meier is the inspiring thought leader behind digital humanitarians, a grassroots  revolution with a reach and impact that in only a few years has transformed global  humanitarian response. The activation and contribution of digital humanitarians are  today an essential part of humanitarian response operations in disaster-aἀected areas  all over the world. Patrick’s book provides for an absolutely essential, practical, and  inspiring account of the origins and future of this new humanitarian realm, where  human ingenuity, new technologies, and computational power create unprecedented  opportunities for saving human lives. I consider this book as authoritative core reading  for academics, practitioners, and policy makers for years to come.   —Bartel Van de Walle, Cofounder, Information Systems for Crisis  Response and Management  ISCRAM  and Associate Professor, Department  of Information Management, Tilburg University  In clear, compelling prose, Patrick Meier oἀers readers of Digital Humanitarians a front  row seat into the start of the digital revolution that has swept the world since he and his  colleagues created—from scratch and on the fly—a digitally based response to the 2010  earthquake that devastated Haiti. He explains the strengths and potential weaknesses  of using big data and crowdsourced analytics in crisis situations. It is at once a deeply  personal and intellectually satisfying book.  —Steven Livingston, Professor of Media and Public and International Aἀairs   at the Elliott School of International Aἀairs   at George Washington University  GWU   Technological and methodological developments are rapidly changing the face of  humanitarian action. We are encountering a flurry of new tools involving cell phones  and Internet-based platforms for data aggregation, analysis, and visualization. We are  exploiting the potential of collective and artificial intelligence. We are collecting data  from satellites and drones while we are also involving thousands of people in reporting  events, locations of assets, and places of danger. In Digital Humanitarians, Patrick Meier  provides an interesting and useful overview of these developments, and oἀers examples  drawn from years of hard-earned experience. This is essential reading for both students  and practitioners of humanitarian action. Those who read it will be able to navigate this  important, exciting, and dynamic field.   —Joseph G. Bock, Teaching Professor, Eck Institute for Global Health,   University of Notre Dame, and author of The Technology of Nonviolence:  Social Media and Violence Prevention   Patrick Meier is a humanitarian in the trenches—working tirelessly to use technology  for the greater good. In his new book, he highlights the latest solutions revolutionizing  humanitarian response, ranging from social media platforms powered by artificial  intelligence to crowd computing solutions that analyze satellite and UAV imagery.  Throughout the book, however, Patrick returns to the fundamental story behind these  technologies—the human story, the digital humanitarian volunteers who mobilize  across time zones to help others in need. As Patrick says, “This is the kind of world I  want to live in.”  —Claire Diaz-Ortiz, Director of Social Innovation, Twitter   Meier’s book is essential reading on at least two counts. First, it captures key develop- ments on and around the use of web, Internet and mobile communications during and  after disasters, cutting through the hype and grappling with critical questions related to  technology and governance. Second, it is a timely publication. The preparation, response  to and recovery from disasters today is inextricably entwined with technology, at local,  regional and international levels. Meier looks at how what is already taken for granted  came about, and looks critically at what it means for humanitarianism in the future.  —Daniel Stauffacher, Former Swiss Ambassador to the United Nations and  Founder of the ICT for Peace Foundation  ICT4Peace ; Sanjana Hattotuwa,  Special Advisor at ICT4Peace & TED Fellow   Finally, someone who knows both the potential of mobile, networked technologies and  the practicalities of how to use these tools to enhance humanitarian work. Meier’s new  book, Digital Humanitarians, has the potential to relieve suἀering by showing activists,  citizens, and technologists how to use everything from satellite imagery to big data tech- niques and social media to save lives in natural disasters and other crises that require  humanitarian response. This book can save lives!  —Howard Rheingold, Lecturer at Stanford University and author of bestsellers  Smart Mobs, Net Smart and Virtual Reality  The ideas and lessons in this book could save millions of lives in the 21st century. Digital  tools—from crowdsourced mobile data to satellite imagery—promise to make the world  more transparent, more inclusive, and more locally empowered. Patrick Meier charts a  bold new course for humanitarianism that harnesses technology’s revolutionary poten- tial, while also addressing the need for safeguards. His brilliant combination of scholar- ship, real-world experience, and thoughtful perspective makes this essential reading for  anyone who wants to understand the future of humanitarian action.  —Andrew Zolli, Futurist and author of Resilience: Why Things Bounce Back  Since it became possible for nearly anyone with a cell phone or an Internet connection  to send data, photos, and other information around the world with a few key strokes,  we’ve seen a number of books attempt to catalog this incredible revolution. What makes  this book diἀerent—and exceptionally important to humanitarians and peacebuilders  alike—is that it has been written from the perspective of one who has helped to lead the    revolution. If you want to understand both the power and the pitfalls of digital human- itarianism—a movement unprecedented in human history—read Patrick’s take on it.  You’ll be richer for it.  —Sheldon Himelfarb, Director of PeaceTech Lab,  United States Institute for Peace  USIP   Patrick Meier has been at the center of the digital humanitarian movement for all of its  recent history. This thoughtful collection of case studies and analyses provides a first- hand account of how the tools, practices and community of digital humanitarians have  succeeded, stumbled, and evolved. There’s a welcome mix of accessible technical content  and, more importantly, stories about the people who’ve taken technology and shaped it  into tools that help others when they’re most in need.  —Tariq Khokhar, Data Scientist and Open Data Evangelist, World Bank  Digital Humanitarians is a MUST-READ for anyone who believes that new technologies  and big data, when used properly, can save millions of peoples lives during disasters and  times of crisis. Meier is not only a master storyteller of real world events, he is a practi- tioner and visionary who is showing governments and NGOs, and all of us how to think  and do disaster relief in the 21st century.  —Andrew Rasiej, Founder of Personal Democracy Media  and Senior Technology Advisor at Sunlight Foundation   If you’re looking for a window into the rapidly expanding world of online volunteers,  this book is for you. In this timely tome, Meier, who played a seminal role in redefining  how we think about “digital humanitarianism” after the devastating earthquake in Haiti  in 2010, deftly explores the significant opportunities for public good and serious risks to  privacy, security, and misallocated resources, at the worst of times. From data analysis  to data quality, he digs in to what’s possible with distributed intelligence and what’s still  needed, including machine learning and frameworks for verification. In a world that  brims over with potential to help one another through our newly networked devices,  Meier’s book provides a map for how to do it better.  —Alexander Howard, Writer and Founder of “E Pluribus Unum”    DIGITAL HUMANITARIANS  How BIG DATA Is Changing the Face of  Humanitarian Response    DIGITAL HUMANITARIANS  How BIG DATA Is Changing the Face of  Humanitarian Response  PATRICK MEIER  Boca Raton  London  New York  CRC Press is an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group, an informa business   CRC Press Taylor & Francis Group 6000 Broken Sound Parkway NW, Suite 300 Boca Raton, FL 33487-2742   2015 by Patrick Meier CRC Press is an imprint of Taylor & Francis Group, an Informa business No claim to original U.S. Government works Version Date: 20150105 International Standard Book Number-13: 978-1-4987-2652-8  eBook - PDF  This book contains information obtained from authentic and highly regarded sources.

There was a time when humanitarian response was the purview of an  elite, hardened set of type A personalities devoted to saving the lives of  those coping with the perils of major conflicts and disasters. These human- itarians were a class not dissimilar to the brave pioneers traveling west  in search of adventure, forging new paths in the midst of contexts where  there were few rules, many dangers, and where the rewards were great. For  humanitarians, the reward of course was not gold or land, but the chance  to make a diἀerence in the lives of countless of their fellow human beings  beset by disaster. Yet, the tangible measures of their success were difficult  to grasp. Stories of how many days these brave individuals went without  sleep, showers, adequate food, and how they coped with a variety of diἀer- ent dangers created a picture of the context, but aἀorded little information  about the eἀectiveness of the international humanitarian system, let alone  the eἀorts of local communities in dealing with disaster.  There  was  something  strangely  and  romantically  exciting  about  this  period, though the reality was that there was very little concrete empirical  evidence to demonstrate the eἀectiveness of aid: it was often slow in com- ing, and there was a dearth of information about what aἀected people’s  needs were and how well-matched the international system’s response was  to these needs. There was no sense of coordination between local disas- ter-aἀected  communities  and  international  agencies,  let  alone  amongst  humanitarian agencies themselves.   Two major things happened in the mid 2000s that would dramatically  change  how  we   the  citizens  of  the  world   would  come  to  understand  and cope with disasters. The first was a series of reforms that took place  within the international humanitarian system  the Humanitarian Reform  Process , and the second was the proliferation of mobile communications  technologies, the rise of social, digital media, and access to vast quantities  of all kinds of data  digital text, SMS, tweets, satellite, and UAV imagery ,  all in the hands of anyone with the inclination, drive, and motivation to  do something constructive with it.  xi   xii     Foreword  The latter phenomenon is the subject of this captivating new book writ- ten in highly accessible prose. It sheds light on the groundswell of citizen- led direct participation in disaster relief. Gone are the days where a dearth  of information meant that only a very few had direct knowledge of what  happened during disasters and with the ensuing response. Whereas pre- vious generations of concerned citizens were passive recipients of news  delivered by newspapers and television reports, today’s citizens are active  participants in disaster relief and response, creating millions of pieces of  information, novel information, in texts, tweets, and images made avail- able in real time.  The result is that the humanitarian field has been forever changed by the  advent of Big Data and the attendant challenges of dealing with it accu- rately and quickly.  Patrick Meier weaves together a story of human dedication, innovation,  and stick-to-itiveness that starts that fateful day in January of 2010 when  a massive earthquake devastated Haiti, killing hundreds of thousands of  people and leaving many thousands more injured and in need of massive  amounts of humanitarian assistance. This response was diἀerent, though,  in that it not only included local communities, the national government  of Haiti, and thousands of international humanitarians and agencies that  make up the international humanitarian system, but the eἀorts of large  numbers of digital volunteers who worked together to respond to massive  numbers of tweets and text messages to identify the locations of people  trapped in the rubble, but still alive and texting for help. This is novel and  this is just the beginning of the story.  Patrick narrates a human tale that is intermixed with rapid advances in  technology, computing power, proliferation of mobile smartphones, the  rapid expansion in the use of social media  especially Twitter, Facebook,  and YouTube , and the advent of a mass amount of accessible commer- cial  and  private  imagery  made  available  through  both  satellites  and  unmanned aerial vehicles  UAVs or drones . These disparate technologies  and  sources  of  information  are  brought  together  in  a nearly  disjointed  and manual manner to start  in Haiti handling tens of thousands of SMS  messages—from a dorm room! , and with each experience in responding  to natural disasters and conflict, the landscape changes. By the time we  reach the finale, four short years later, we are in a c ompletely diἀerent  world where a dedicated, global network of volunteers, whom Patrick calls  “digital humanitarians”  a network of loosely affiliated people bound by  a humanitarian calling and access to the Internet and Twitter , stand on    Foreword     xiii  call, ready to work hand-in-hand with machines that are programmed to  learn from humans how to handle, code, and interpret tens of millions of  short messages being sent through Twitter and other sources.  Digital Humanitarians tells the compelling story of how mobile tech- nologies, computer applications, and vast quantities of digital data work  in concert with a dedicated global network of new humanitarians ready  to shed light on disaster-aἀected areas in hours, not days or weeks. Just  how quickly the technology, applications, and processes are developing is  astounding. One gets the sense of being hurled from the Middle Ages to  the Enlightenment at exponentially increasing velocity.  This is a world where dedicated people work closely with and in increas- ingly elegant and synchronous ways with the technologies and applications  they have created to better the lives of those most aἀected by disasters. But  this is a rapidly changing world, one where in the moment you get your  bearings, the context has completely changed. Nor is Patrick naïve to the  dangers presented by these technologies in the hands of those with less  meritorious  intentions  than  the  digital  humanitarians  he  writes  about.  Though this community is writing the rules for the safe and appropriate  uses of these technologies as they go, Patrick is cognizant of the need to  codify ethical standards in doctrine, and to ensure that the use of tech- nology and Big Data for disaster response is even safer than older analog  technologies were just a few short years ago. What he’s not willing to do is  sit back and wait for the world to catch up. He’ll be where he’s most com- fortable, among a network of like-minded and kind-hearted people who  are two steps ahead of the rest.  Dr. Enzo Bollettino Executive Director of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative  HHI   Harvard University    Preface  This is the story of thousands of largely anonymous volunteers who stepped  forward in times of need. They worked long, sleepless hours for free and  without expectation of praise  or blame . They did this because they saw  a need. My role in this, given the accidents of interest and experience, has  often been as a catalyst. While the stories that follow are told from my  own voice and perspective, this should not be interpreted as taking away  from the hundreds and thousands of other volunteers who each have their  own stories to tell. On the contrary, I seek to amplify some of our shared  stories based on how I personally experienced them. Like others, I simply  found myself in the midst of these digital humanitarian eἀorts due to hap- penstance and the convergence of my professional interests and personal  needs. One of these needs was to do something—anything—to fill those  dreadful hours not knowing whether the woman I loved had survived the  earthquake in Haiti. I did not catalyze the digital response to the earth- quake with a grand strategy in mind. I reacted because I was anxious and  desperate. From that point on digital humanitarian eἀorts took on a life  of their own.  xv    Acknowledgments  The stories that follow would not exist were it not for the hundreds and  thousands  of  digital  volunteers  who  continue  to  support  relief  eἀorts  worldwide. So my deep gratitude goes to them first and foremost. In writ- ing these stories, I have also benefited from invaluable feedback, both in  terms of style and content. My parents, brother, and wife read every word  of every page, providing me with the kind of insightful, personal guid- ance that only a caring family can oἀer. My professional and academic  colleagues  reviewed  my  final  drafts  with  a r emarkable  level  of  detail.  I  am  thus  particularly  grateful  to  Carlos  Castillo,  Sanjana  Hattotuwa,  Muhammad Imran, Steven Livingston, Andrej Verity, and Sarah Vieweg.  I also thank my publisher Lara Zoble, who immediately understood what  I wanted to do with these stories, and I a m equally grateful to Andrea  Verity for her design of the perfect cover for this book, which includes  profile pictures of some of the remarkable digital humanitarians who I’ve  had the honor of learning from over the years. Last, but certainly not least,  I had the luxury of writing the bulk of this book during my residency fel- lowship at the Rockefeller Foundation’s center in beautiful Bellagio, Italy.  So I want to sincerely thank Rob Garris and the entire Bellagio team for  providing what was truly the perfect environment for fruitful reflections  and writing.  xvii    1  The Rise of Digital Humanitarians  Do you remember where you were at 4:52 p.m. on January 12, 2010? I will  never forget.  I was in Boston—in my dorm room to be exact—catching up on emails  while watching CNN. A minute later, a powerful earthquake devastated  the city of Port-au-Prince. I was paralyzed with shock and could barely  breathe when the news hit CNN. Over 100,000 Haitians and humanitar- ians were feared dead, a number that would double in the days that fol- lowed. My wife could easily have been part of that statistic. She was doing  research in Port-au-Prince at the time and was due back in Boston the  next day. I called and texted her cell phone; I sent her emails and looked  for her on Skype and social media. While I found dozens of Haitians and  expats describing the devastation live on Twitter and Facebook, there was  no sign of her anywhere on social media. Only after midnight did I finally  get an SMS from Haiti. She and our friends were alive; they had narrowly  escaped a c ollapsing building. Few in Haiti were as lucky as dozens of  aftershocks claimed more lives through the night.  My own story could have ended there, with that SMS. But what hap- pened between 4:53 p.m. and the following morning when the light of day  returned would ultimately change the future of humanitarian response.  That night was the genesis of an extraordinary story. In the midst of this  terrible tragedy, a powerful movement was born, aided by digital tech- nologies and driven by thousands of volunteers who cared and wanted to  help; they were the first rays of hope that signaled the rise of today’s digital  humanitarians. This book is their story. Our story. My story.  Digital humanitarians will alter the way you think about what it means  to be a humanitarian. Anyone can be a digital humanitarian, absolutely no  experience necessary; all you need is a big heart and access to the Internet.   1   2     Digital Humanitarians   So you’re welcome to join us online at Digital-Humanitarians.com and make  these stories part of your life. Consider this an open invitation.  MAPPING HAITI LIVE CNN began to recycle the same footage of the Haiti earthquake over and  over. I muted the television. Silence returned as I sat in shock. Outside,  evening spilled into night. It was the middle of winter and bitterly cold. I  felt utterly helpless, refreshing my email inbox every 5 seconds for a sign of  life from my wife. The anxiety was nearly paralyzing. I needed to focus, to  do something—anything. So I launched a digital “crisis map” for the Haiti  earthquake with a lot of help from friends, colleagues, and even complete  strangers.1  A crisis map  or help map  is simply an online digital map like Google  Maps or OpenStreetMap, but one that pinpoints areas hardest hit by a  disaster and where people who are most aἀected need help. I turned CNN  back on and began mapping some of the few news reports coming out of  Haiti. When the news became repetitive again, I turned to social media.  I had found dozens of Haitians tweeting live from the country’s capital,  describing the devastation and urgent needs they witnessed while walk- ing through the rubble-filled streets. A tweet is like a public SMS, which  everyone can read by simply going to Twitter.com. Some of these short  messages  coming  from  Port-au-Prince  provided  enough  geographical  clues  to  be  placed  on  the  crisis  map. One  tweet,  for  example,  included  the address of a pharmacy in the neighborhood of Pétionville that was  still open and stocked with first aid supplies. I used the digital mapping  website Ushahidi.com  which means “witness” in Swahili  to map what  Haitians  were  witnessing.2  Ushahidi  is  a f ree  online  mapping  platform  developed in Africa. You can think of Ushahidi as an email account con- nected to a Google Map. But Ushahidi’s inbox is not limited to receiving  emails. This inbox can also receive tweets and text messages  SMS , for  example. So I set my Ushahidi inbox to collect all tweets that contained  the words Haiti and earthquake. The resulting tweets would then appear  in my inbox—like that tweet about the drug store, for example. I’d then  copy the text of the tweet from the Ushahidi inbox and add it to the map.  This would create a dot on the digital map, which anyone could click on to  read the original text of the tweet. Taken together, these hundreds of dots    The Rise of Digital Humanitarians     3  portrayed a rough, near real-time, assessment of the earthquake’s impact  and the resulting needs on a single, interactive map.  But most tweets were impossible to map. Indeed, only a very small frac- tion of these public messages included street names. Several tweets, how- ever, did refer to hospitals, schools, churches, shops, markets, hotels, or  restaurants. So I Googled the names of these schools and shops in hopes  of finding clues on the World Wide Web as to where in Port-au-Prince  these buildings were located. But finding exact locations was difficult and  very time-consuming. So I reached out to several friends on Skype for  help. Skype allows you to make free calls straight from your computer or  smartphone and can also be used to “chat” live  in writing  with others  who have a Skype account.  My friends and I c reated a c hat group where we posted tweets that  could potentially be mapped. At times, several of us would collaborate  on  mapping  just  one  tweet  if  it  seemed  particularly  important.  With  some creative detective work, ample stubbornness, and the aid of Google  Earth, we were able to map dozens of urgent tweets. Google Earth is sim- ply a global, “zoomable” map of our planet made from high-resolution  satellite  imagery.  We  also  began  to  monitor  and  map  updates  posted  on  Facebook  groups  created  by  Haitians  in  the  United  States.  They  were in direct contact with their loved ones back home and thus able  to share very specific and up-to-date information, which they posted to  Facebook. Shortly after midnight, while mapping one of these updates,  I received the text message. My wife was alive. I closed my eyes as tears  swelled. My nightmare was over. She’d be home soon.  The sound of singing brought me back. On CNN, video footage of Port- au-Prince captured the soft sound of hopeful voices singing in the dark- ness.  Fearing  more  aftershocks,  many  Haitians  whose  homes  were  still  standing were too scared to reenter them. So they sat in the pitch black  of the night, singing and rocking gently to keep each other strong. While  my own nightmare was over, the nightmares of most Haitians were just  beginning. So my friends and I kept on mapping through the night, using  Skype to coordinate our eἀorts. We didn’t sleep that night, or much of that  week or month, for that matter.  As daylight returned to the Caribbean the following day, we were over- whelmed  by  the  amount  of  information  being  published  on  social  and  mainstream media. We had tens of thousands of unread tweets in our  Ushahidi inbox and simply couldn’t keep up with the vast volume and  velocity of news coming out of Port-au-Prince. I thus reached out to fellow    4     Digital Humanitarians   classmates at The Fletcher School and also emailed several undergraduate  students at Tufts University. Since our crisis mapping eἀorts were entirely  digital and thus online, we could even turn to friends and colleagues from  other countries to ask for their help. All they needed to do was jump on  Skype for a crash course on crisis mapping.  The fact that many of us in Boston were students at the same university  meant that we were already part of an existing social network. In other  words, our offline friendships and connections facilitated our online mobi- lization and ties to other social networks both in the U.S. and abroad. For  example, exchange students at The Fletcher School reached out to fellow  classmates at their home universities in Switzerland and elsewhere, which  led to new “situation rooms” being set up across the world—all volunteer  driven, and all geared toward supporting our digital humanitarian eἀorts  in Boston. This global reach soon meant that we could map 24 hours a day. By Saturday afternoon, about 100 hours after the earthquake struck, we  had trained well over a hundred volunteers, both in person and via Skype.  All of them were now digital humanitarians, able to help map the damage  and urgent needs being reported from Haiti across multiple media. My  dorm room had become a “nerve center” of sorts for these digital humani- tarian eἀorts. At one point, the room was so packed with digital humani- tarians that new volunteers couldn’t get past the stairwell. So that’s where  they  were  trained  and  where  many  also  volunteered.  I w as  in  awe  and  deeply moved by this human wave of goodwill. Many of these students  were pulling all-nighters in the middle of their winter holidays  and later  during classes  to help Haitians aἀected by the disaster. And most vol- unteers who showed up at my dorm were complete strangers, friends of  friends, neighbors, parents, teachers, staἀ, etc. At one point, I remember  looking up from my laptop at the faces of volunteers around me—there  were well over a dozen diἀerent nationalities represented, a mini United  Nations of digital volunteers.  The map in Figure 1.1 was like no other map that I or anyone else had  ever seen. This map did not look the same for more than 10 minutes as  volunteers kept posting new reports of damage and needs day and night.  The map was alive: a living, breathing organism. By the end of the first  week, we had collectively mapped several hundred individual reports.  But we were still lagging behind. Our Ushahidi inbox had exploded with  hundreds  of  thousands  of  unread  tweets.  We  were  unable  to  keep  up  with the huge volume of news on the Haiti earthquake and desperately  needed  more  help,  more  filters  to  find  the  most  important  tweets.  So    The Rise of Digital Humanitarians     5  FIGURE 1.1 Screenshot of the Haiti Crisis Map. we kept training as many new volunteers as possible every day—often  several times a day.  SUPPORTING SEARCH AND RESCUE EFFORTS  That Sunday night, a U.S. search and rescue  SAR  team in Haiti got in  touch with us via Skype. They had learned about our crisis mapping eἀorts  from one of the digital volunteers, John Crowley, who had joined us in my  dorm room. His contacts proved invaluable in linking our eἀorts directly  to the relief eἀorts on the ground. So on one snowy Boston night, we found  ourselves Skyping live with a SAR team stationed in Haiti—we being a  bunch of students and strangers cramped into my small dorm room more  than 1,500 miles north of Port-au-Prince. This felt highly surreal. The SAR  team had set up camp right oἀ the runway of the international airport in  Port-au-Prince and needed to know the exact GPS coordinates for seven  incomplete street addresses as soon as possible as they had received reports  from various sources that potential survivors were still buried under the    6     Digital Humanitarians   rubble at these locations.  Their search and rescue helicopters would be  heading out at 6:00 the next morning to look for these survivors.  The Google Map of Port-au-Prince at the time was very sparse; half of  the roads had not been mapped. Meanwhile, detailed road maps of Haiti  were practically impossible to find. So Anna Schulz—a digital volunteer  who had pleasantly surprised herself by how good she was at finding loca- tion information using satellite imagery—kindly oἀered to assist the SAR  team. It took Anna only an hour on Google Earth to find the GPS coor- dinates for six of the seven locations. She got on Skype to update the SAR  team in Port-au-Prince. But the seventh location remained a frustrating  mystery.  All  the  SAR  team  had  for  location  7 w as  “Un  Bon  Prix,  near  Napley Inn Hotel”  Figure 1.2 .  Anna  had  already  leafed  through  a  copy  of  Lonely  Planet  Haiti.  We  had bought the guide the day before, and it quickly proved invaluable to  find the locations of many points of interest in Port-au-Prince. That book  would become the most used Lonely Planet Haiti guide that never made it  to Haiti. But there was no mention of “Napley Inn Hotel” anywhere in the  guide. Desperate, we posted the following message on Twitter:  Urgent Please RT need address of Un Bon Prix near Napley Inn, people  trapped!3  Some  time  later,  we  received  a reply  from  a Twitter  user,  a c omplete  stranger, who said the Napley Inn was actually owned by  and called  the  Holiday Inn. With the right name in hand, Anna began her detective work   FIGURE 1.2 Skype message from Search and Rescue team.   The Rise of Digital Humanitarians     7  anew to find out where in Haiti the Holiday Inn was located. Surprisingly,  Lonely Planet did not have a listing for the Holiday Inn, so Anna started  scouring the satellite images on Google Earth again. The clue, it turned  out, was finding the hotel’s pool. There are very, very few swimming pools  in Port-au-Prince, and almost all belong to hotels. Now all we had to do  was find out which pools belonged to which hotels, and the one left over  would be the pool belonging to the Holiday Inn. Anna was now one step  closer to finding the exact location of where individuals were reportedly  buried under the rubble—or so we thought.  It was now well past 1:00 in the morning, but we still had no idea where  Un Bon Prix was located, despite Anna finding the orphaned pool. We  only had 5 hours left before the search and rescue team was going to fly out  with its choppers to those six other locations. So we posted another SOS  on Twitter. To our amazement, we received a reply from another complete  stranger who had found a curriculum vitae  CV  on the web for a Haitian  who used to work at Un Bon Prix. She tweeted the link to the CV and sug- gested we call this person for directions since he now lived in Brooklyn,  New York.  So  we  did,  and  after  a  few  minutes  of  broken  French  and  English,  I  managed to get the driving directions to Un Bon Prix. We immediately  posted this information in our Skype chat with the SAR team who were  still awake and online at the Port-au-Prince airport. Hours later, the team  flew to all seven locations. Tragically, they only found survivors at one of  the locations.  Some time later, we found out that the right spelling of “Napley Inn”  was actually “Napoli Inn.” This was a diἀerent hotel altogether, but news  reports had confirmed that a young man had been pulled out of the rubble  from what was left of the inn. This false lead may explain why we had such  a hard time finding any clues about the location of Un Bon Prix.  PREPARING FOR THE LONG HAUL At  some  point  during  our  digital  humanitarian  eἀorts,  we  received  a  call from a member of FEMA’s Task Force 3. FEMA is the U.S. Federal  Emergency Management Agency, and Task Force 3 had been dispatched to  support the relief eἀorts in Port-au-Prince. The person on the call gave us a  quick crash course on how to manage an emergency command center. He    8     Digital Humanitarians   repeated the following several times: “Take shifts and get some counseling  support.” At the end of the call, he also pleaded the following: “Whatever  anyone tells you, don’t stop mapping.”  While this validated our eἀorts and felt incredibly rewarding, the pres- sure that came with the directive was tremendous  although we didn’t real- ize it at the time . After all, I had only launched this digital humanitarian  response as a result of emotional shock—I simply wanted to find a way to  help and didn’t have a grand plan. My decision to launch the Haiti Crisis  Map was certainly not based on a calculated strategy to help inform official  relief eἀorts in Haiti. What’s more, no one had ever done anything quite  like this before. So my friends and I were basically “making it up as we went  along,” eἀectively writing  and rewriting  the how-to book every day.  We eventually relocated our nerve center to a classroom in the basement  of The Fletcher School, which we took over and occupied full-time for the  rest of the semester. This is where many Haitians from the Diaspora in  Boston joined us as digital volunteers. Sabina Carlson, one of the under- graduate volunteers from Tufts who had joined our digital humanitarian  eἀorts, had spent time in Haiti and thus spoke fluent Creole. So she kindly  oἀered to serve as liaison with local communities in Haiti and with the  Diaspora in the United States, and quickly sent word of our eἀorts to her  large network. The response was truly heartwarming. A community leader  from the Haitian Diaspora in Boston paid us a personal visit in the base- ment one night to thank us all for our eἀorts. “We have already sent money  and  medical  supplies  to  our  families  and  friends  back  home,  but  your  eἀorts are allowing us to be even more involved in the response eἀorts.  Thank you for everything you are doing for Haiti. Thank you for caring.”  We were touched by her warmth, kindness, and sincerity. We told her  that  none  of  these  eἀorts  would  be  possible  without  the  many  Haitian  volunteers who were spending countless hours every day and night sup- porting  this  digital  humanitarian  response.  There’d  be  no  Haiti  Crisis  Map were it not for Haitian volunteers. After all, we were certainly not  the experts on Haiti, nor did we know any of the streets, let alone neigh- borhoods. At one point, in fact, a former taxi driver from Port-au-Prince  showed up in our command center. He found us quietly hunched over our  laptops in the basement very late one night. We explained that we were  trying to find the location of streets and other landmarks in downtown  Port-au-Prince. He was eager to help. We couldn’t believe our luck and  thanked him repeatedly. Later on, one of the security guards who worked  the night shift at The Fletcher School would regularly swing by to oἀer    The Rise of Digital Humanitarians     9  his help. He too was Haitian, and his knowledge of Port-au-Prince was  remarkable. They were the real pros, not us. So we pulled up some extra  chairs,  showed  them  how  we  captured  GPS  coordinates  using  Google  Earth and OpenStreetMap. They did the rest, applying their local knowl- edge to aid the relief eἀorts in their home country.  LAUNCHING AN SMS LIFE LINE A week after the earthquake, the largest telecommunication company in  Haiti,  Digicel,  launched  a f ree  SMS  number—4636—that  would  allow  anyone in Haiti to text in their urgent needs directly to the inbox of our  crisis map. Days earlier, my colleague Josh Nesbit had posted a tweet say- ing he was looking for an SMS “gateway” to let Haitians text our Haiti  Crisis  Map  directly.4  One  of  Josh’s  Twitter  followers  who  was  living  in Cameroon tweeted back, oἀering to put Josh directly in touch with  his colleagues at Digicel Haiti. The SMS system was successfully set up  within days thanks to many able colleagues and committed volunteers,  including, but not limited to, Ed Jezierski and Nicolas di Tada at the NGO  InsTEDD, Rob Munro at Stanford University, and Katie Stanton at the  U.S. State Department.  In the meantime, Rob began recruiting English- and Creole-speaking  volunteers via Facebook. Why? Because none of us spoke a word of Haitian  Creole, and if Haitians were to use the SMS lifeline we were setting up, then  we’d be receiving thousands of text messages in Creole, not English. We  therefore needed some major help in translating these potentially urgent  messages. So another volunteer, Brian Herbert from Ushahidi, took the  lead in customizing an existing website so that Haitians could log in to  help translate incoming text messages one at a time.5 During the week that  followed, tens of thousands of text messages were translated by hundreds  of Creole-speaking volunteers in dozens of countries. According to Rob,  who coordinated the SMS translation eἀorts, the average turnaround time  between an SMS leaving a cell phone in Haiti and the English translation  arriving in the inbox of our crisis map was just 10 minutes.6  When the SMS service was set up, colleagues from the Thomson Reuters  Foundation  in  Haiti  announced  the  service  via  local  community  radio  stations across Port-au-Prince.7 As had been agreed by all partners, the  Reuters team invited Haitians to text their urgent needs along with their    10     Digital Humanitarians   locations to the number 4636. This presented a major challenge, however.  We had to be very careful in managing expectations since we couldn’t pos- sibly guarantee a response by official humanitarian organizations. Sabina,  the  volunteer  in  charge  of  liaising  with  the  Haitian  community  in  the  United States, reached out to the Diaspora to spread the word and manage  expectations. She and I also spent several hours on Haitian Diaspora radio  and television explaining how the service worked and being explicit that  texting in a need would not guarantee a response. The 4636 number was  simply an information service, and humanitarians were doing their best  to respond to the most urgent life-and-death messages. It was impossible  to be 100% eἀective in managing expectations, however, which was a con- stant source of worry for Sabina and I throughout the operation.  That said, and as Rob rightly notes, “All crisis response is an exercise  in failure. We cannot help everyone that needs help. . . . To the people we  helped it was everything, but in the scale of the whole crisis it was small.  However, for a short time in Haiti the ability to respond to requests for  help was much wider than at any point in Haiti’s past when even child- births reported through 4636 were being responded to.”8 In Boston, digital  volunteers identified the most urgent life-and-death SMS’s and prioritized  these for mapping. Here are two examples of the translated text messages  we received:  My name is [removed for privacy] I’m not dead. I am under the rubbles  in University Caraibes, which is in [address removed for privacy]. Please  come and get me!9  My name is [removed for privacy] my brother is working in Unicef and I  live in [address removed for privacy] I have 2 people that is still alive under  the building still! Send Help!10  While  we  prioritized  these  types  of  messages,  we  were  always  falling  behind. There were many more text messages than we could possibly triage  and map on any given day. By the end of that week, as the search and rescue  phase drew to a close, we had identified and mapped about 1,500 individual  text messages—that is, about 1% of all the SMS’s received thus far, which  was quite the feat given all the challenges. But as noted earlier, this entire  eἀort would have been completely impossible without volunteers from the  Haitian  Diaspora  and  beyond.11  Over  1,000  Creole-speaking  volunteers  based in over 40 countries translated tens of thousands of messages day and    The Rise of Digital Humanitarians     11  night for weeks on end.12 And while we volunteers in Boston didn’t realize it  right away given everything that was going on, some of the most avid users  of the SMS feed were Haitians in the United States who used the informa- tion to coordinate local response eἀorts on the ground.13 Soon enough, the  mainstream media also caught wind of our eἀorts: The Haiti Crisis Map was  broadcast live on CNN and later featured on the BBC, in The Washington  Post and The New York Times, on NPR, and other high-profile news outlets. The use of SMS changed the entire nature of our digital humanitarian  eἀorts. It was one thing to passively harvest and collect public information  from  social  and  mainstream  media,  but  actively  requesting  information  from the disaster-aἀected population raised a number of serious issues. As  mentioned above, were we inevitably raising expectations by soliciting SMS  reports despite our best eἀorts to explain that responses were not guaran- teed? Of course, any type of humanitarian intervention raises hopes, but  still. There were also serious questions with respect to data privacy and pro- tection. That is, should we be making the content of the text messages public  on the crisis map, along with personal names and phone numbers?  My wife, who had just returned from Haiti, posed this privacy question  to Louis Aucoin, a renowned professor of law at The Fletcher School who  also happened to have deep knowledge of Haiti. He had not encountered a  privacy question quite like this before, replying, “I am not sure who would  have the expertise on this, but it seems quite clear to me that if you are  able to obtain their numbers and they are sending you this information,  consent is implied.”14 To get a second opinion, we posed the same ques- tion to legal experts at Harvard University, but they replied much later and  weren’t sure either—suggesting that a panel of experts be organized to dis- cuss these issues.  A full 7 days had already passed since the earthquake. This meant that  the search and rescue phase was rapidly drawing to a close. If there were  any survivors still trapped under the rubble, we had to act fast and wouldn’t  have the luxury of setting up an academic seminar or workshop on the  topic. So I proceeded to consult several seasoned humanitarian colleagues  at the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative for additional guidance. They per- sonally felt that making these SMSs public carried minimal risks—echoing  the sentiment expressed by Professor Aucoin, who stated that the situation  was indeed “really pretty low risk.”15 Still, we decided to only publish the  most urgent messages—which constituted not more than 1–2% of the SMSs  texted to the 4636 number—a decision that remains controversial.16   12     Digital Humanitarians   SENDING IN THE CHOPPERS At one point after the launch of the SMS service, the U.S. Coast Guard  contacted us. They wanted to connect on Skype and requested that we  copy and paste all actionable and urgent messages with GPS coordinates  directly into the dedicated Skype chat. This way, they wouldn’t have to  keep refreshing the crisis map every 5 minutes for new reports. Clearly,  the digital map was not always the best way to communicate the crisis  information we were collecting.  Some time later, we received the following email from the U.S. Marine   Corps  USMC :  I  am  with  the  US  Marine  Corps.  I a m  stateside  assisting  the  22  MEU  [Marine Expeditionary Unit] coming oἀ the USS Bataan [on the Haitian  Coast]. We want to use your data to bring aid to the people Haiti right now.  The USMC is focusing on Leogane, Grand Goave, and Petit Goave. Is there  a way to import your data into Google Earth or GIS? We want to make this  work for the people of Haiti . . . please let me know ASAP.17  We  immediately  replied  and  did  everything  we  could  to  provide  the  Marine Corps with urgent and actionable content. The following week,  our same contact there sent us the following email, giving us permission  later on to share it publicly:  I can not overemphasize to you what the work of the Ushahidi Haiti [Crisis  Map] has provided. It is saving lives every day. I wish I had time to docu- ment to you every example, but there are too many and our operation is  moving too fast. Here is one from the 22 MEU [Marine Expeditionary Unit]:  “We had data on an area outside of Grand Goave needing help. Today, we  sent an assessment team out there to validate their needs and everything  checked out. While the team was out there, they found two old women and  a young girl with serious injuries from the earthquake; one of the women  had critical respiratory issues. They were evacuated.”  Your  site  saved  these  people’s  lives.  I s ay  with  confidence  that  there  are 100s of these kinds of stories. The Marine Corps is using your project  every second of the day to get aid and assistance to the people that need  it most. . . . But it is YOUR data and YOUR work that is putting aid and  assistance directly on the target and saving lives. Our big gap right now is  locating NGOs and where they are working. Your site is helping with that.    The Rise of Digital Humanitarians     13  FIGURE 1.3 Tweet by FEMA administrator Craig Fugate.  Keep up the good work!! You are making the biggest diἀerence of anything  I have seen out there in the open source world.18  More disaster responders were now aware of our crowdsourced infor- mation service. Indeed, FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate even tweeted  a  link  to  the  map  describing  the  resource  as  the  most  up-to-date  and  comprehensive information available to the humanitarian community19   see Figure 1.3 . As a result, many international humanitarian respond- ers  in  Port-au-Prince  thought  that  the  volunteers  behind  the  live  map  were actually on-site in Haiti, which would explain why the map was so  detailed and up to date. Many didn’t realize that we were digital humani- tarians, with our nerve center located some 1,500 miles north in snowy  Boston. Nor did they realize that the bulk of our volunteers were based in  dozens of countries around the world.  Groups like the U.S. military, who knew that our operation was con- ducted entirely online, sent officials to Boston to observe our eἀorts in  person.  Indeed,  Lt.  Gen.  H.  Steven  Blum,  the  second  in  command  at  NORTHCOM, paid us a personal visit and commended all volunteers for  their commitment to the relief eἀorts: “You are doing a remarkable job.  We all need to learn from you.”20  OPENSTREETMAP TO THE RESCUE But  this  entire  eἀort  would  have  been  impossible  without  hundreds  of  other  digital  volunteers  from  the  OpenStreetMap   OSM   community.    14     Digital Humanitarians   OSM is basically the Wikipedia of maps, and its online street map of Port- au-Prince also saved lives in Haiti.21 The World Bank and the National  Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration  NOAA  had teamed up with  the Rochester Institute of Technology and other partners to provide OSM  volunteers with very high-resolution satellite and aerial imagery of Port- au-Prince.22 Incredibly, the first batch of satellite imagery was made avail- able to OSM in just 26 hours, which was completely unprecedented at the  time—as was the sheer volume of imagery that was openly shared.  What did OSM volunteers do with this huge amount of very high-reso- lution imagery? They used the OSM website to carefully trace all the roads  and small alleyways they could see in the imagery. Volunteers then used old  defense agency maps from the 1990s to identify some of the street names  for the roads they had just traced. It’s worth noting that many of the digital  volunteers who mobilized in support of these eἀorts after the earthquake  had never used OSM before, nor did they know how to trace high-resolution  imagery on OSM. This led my colleague Kate Chapman to create a short  3-minute  YouTube  video  that  explained  how  to  trace  this  imagery  and  thereby support OSM’s digital humanitarian eἀorts in Haiti. That video was  viewed close to 2,000 times, and by the end of the search and rescue phase,  more than 1,000 digital volunteers had made over 1.4 million edits to the  digital map, making it the most detailed street map of Haiti ever created.23 The  OSM  Haiti  map  became  an  absolutely  invaluable  resource  given  that the Google Map of Port-au-Prince was incomplete at the time, mak- ing the mapping of tweets and text messages very difficult—and at times  simply  impossible.  Indeed,  many  of  the  tweets,  Facebook  updates,  and  mainstream  media  reports  that  were  previously  unmappable  were  now  mappable thanks to the OSM map. Moreover, OpenStreetMap volunteers  didn’t simply map Haiti’s road network. They also mapped the location of  hospitals, schools, and dozens of makeshift camps for internally displaced  persons  IDPs  as well as other important infrastructure critical to the  humanitarian relief eἀorts.  The OSM map of Haiti made a significant diἀerence to the relief eἀorts  on the ground. The digital map, for example, was uploaded to handheld  GPS units used by search and rescue teams on the ground. The map also  found its way on to a popular iPhone app, which a number of humanitar- ian professionals from Europe used extensively. In fact, as my colleague  Schuyler Erle noted when he returned from Port-au-Prince, “The entire  UN system, all of the UN agencies that were acting on the ground were  also using OpenStreetMap for all of their print maps.”24 OSM’s response to    The Rise of Digital Humanitarians     15  Haiti remains one of the most awe-inspiring examples of digital humani- tarian response to this day.  POST-DISASTER PHASE When the relief eἀorts drew to a close and shifted to the early recovery and  post-disaster phase, we were all burnt out, sleep deprived, and emotionally  spent. Reading hundreds or thousands of urgent tweets and text messages  day in and day out had become very difficult to handle psychologically.  We even had a Creole-English medical dictionary in our situation room  because we were getting so many reports of various kinds of injuries, such  as  head-related  traumas.  And  while  these  urgent  pleas  originated  from  more than a t housand miles away, our ability to communicate directly  with aἀected individuals meant that we were intimately connected to their  plight. Recall the advice we’d received from FEMA Task Force 3? Take  shifts and get a therapist. We failed miserably at the first part, but not at  the second suggestion.  I  had  invited  Maggie  Jarmolowski,  an  experienced  trauma  counselor  based in Boston, to provide pro bono counseling to any volunteers who  needed support  like myself . Not only did she join us in the basement to  talk about secondary trauma and how to recognize the signs, she also gave  us a carefully selected list of self-help guides to help us manage the difficult  emotions that some of us were experiencing. In addition, she made herself  available via email and Skype to any and all volunteers who needed to talk. As  the  relief  eἀorts  shifted  to  post-disaster  reconstruction,  the  ques- tion on many of our minds was: “Now what?” Should we “phase out our  eἀorts” and get back to the library to catch up on weeks of missed courses  and homework? Or should we apply the skills we had learned to docu- ment the reconstruction eἀorts that would follow? There were growing  concerns that the billions of dollars in aid and development money that  would inevitably flow into the country would potentially disappear into  the hands of corrupt individuals and organizations. There were also the  usual concerns around the misuse of funds due to the lack of knowledge  regarding actual needs on the ground. One way to add more transpar- ency and accountability to the process might be to map the impact  or  lack thereof  of the reconstruction development projects in and outside  of Port-au-Prince. That is, we could potentially use the same SMS service    16     Digital Humanitarians   to give Haitians the ability to report directly on the reconstruction eἀorts  and any corruption they witnessed. While the vote on what to do next was  certainly not unanimous, the majority of volunteers were keen to extend  our eἀorts to the post-disaster phase.  Since the reconstruction eἀorts were going to last for years, we needed  a way to turn our crisis map into a sustainable “accountability map” of  Haiti. We therefore decided to seek out a local partner. As it turns out, my  wife had visited a local Haitian software company the day before the earth- quake. The company, called Solutions, had been very active in response  to  the  disaster,  creating  its  own  digital  maps  and  web-based  solutions.  We reached out to the Haitian CEO, Kurt Jean-Charles, and spent sev- eral months that summer in Port-au-Prince, working entirely pro bono  to share everything we had learned about digital humanitarian response  along with our software, workflows, best practices, and contacts.  The developer team at Solutions later launched the Noula platform as a  result  of  this  collaboration.25  Today,  Solutions  continues  to  partner  with  humanitarian  and  development  organizations  on  a n umber  of  projects,  including several with the local OpenStreetMap community that flourished  following the earthquake. Members of this local Haitian OSM community  would later become the first digital humanitarian volunteers to respond to  the devastating Japanese earthquake and tsunami the following year.  THE HUMAN STORY The  digital  humanitarian  response  to  Haiti  was  unprecedented.  And  it  was  definitely  far  from  perfect.  The  findings  published  by  the  one  and  only independent, professional evaluation of these eἀorts were mixed.26  Granted, that assessment was carried out more than a year after the earth- quake,  “after  many  months  of  interviews,  sorting  through  Skype  chats  and trying to connect the dots.”27 But still, no one disputes the fact that  the Haiti response marked the start of something new. As one indepen- dent  report  later  noted,  first  responders  with  the  U.S.  military  “found  imagery, digital open source maps, and websites that hosted them  such  as Ushahidi and OpenStreetMap  to occasionally be of greater value than  their  own  assets.”28  If  anything,  our  eἀorts  demonstrated  a  potential,  especially given the fact that none of us had done anything quite like this  before and that the vast majority of us had no professional humanitarian    The Rise of Digital Humanitarians     17  experience to speak of. But our familiarity with digital maps, social media,  and Skype meant that we were able to crowdsource a live crisis map over- night; the fact that we weren’t part of a bureaucracy certainly helped as  well. In addition, we had a lot more time on our hands than our humani- tarian colleagues in Haiti, as many of us could simply skip classes  and did  in droves  or take time oἀ our day jobs to support the digital humanitar- ian eἀorts.  While many media organizations around the world covered our eἀorts,  they  typically  focused  on  the  technology  angle  of  the  story,  hyping  up  the narrative around new technologies. They completely missed the most  important part of this story: both digital maps—the OSM and Haiti Crisis  Map—would have been completely blank, completely devoid of informa- tion, were it not for the thousands of digital volunteers who cared—the  vast  majority  of  them  Haitians.29  Every  point  that  was  added  to  those  digital maps, every edit that was made, was the result of a human being  who took the time to collect and map that information. Every single need  that was mapped, every damage report, street corner, IDP camp, etc., was  manually and often laboriously added by volunteers who cared.  If people hadn’t cared, those digital maps would have been blank. But  people  cared  and  mobilized  online.  These  “digital  Samaritans”  spent  hours, some even days and weeks of their own time, to help others thou- sands of miles away, to help people they would never meet. Why? Because  it was the right thing to do, because they could, because helping others  during tragedies is what makes us human. Until recently, when disasters  struck in faraway lands, we would watch the news on television and wish  we could somehow help. That private wish, that innate human emotion,  would perhaps translate into a private financial donation, and this gesture,  more often than not, never felt like enough. But that was it. There wasn’t  much more we could do. We were simply too far away, too geographically  removed, to provide any additional, meaningful support to those aἀected  by the disaster.  Like many other friends, I felt utterly powerless and overwhelmed when  CNN broke the news on the Haiti earthquake. But today we can translate  these initial, private human emotions into action, into public collective  action  online.  Indeed,  not  only  can  we  donate  money  to  support  relief  eἀorts, but we can also donate our time to support rescue eἀorts even  while we’re on a bus commuting to work on the other side of the planet.  All we need is Internet access. So if you can click “Like” on a Facebook    18     Digital Humanitarians   status update, then you too can be a d igital humanitarian and make a  meaningful diἀerence.  So the next time you feel disillusioned about humanity and perhaps feel  like you’re losing faith in our species, have a look at those digital maps of  Haiti   and  the  dozen  other  crisis  maps  that  digital  humanitarians  have  launched  since .  Hopefully  you’ll  see  what  I s ee:  not  dots  on  a map,  but  direct, tangible evidence that people care—and when given the means, they  can translate this care into action. Global goodwill is real; we simply need to  connect the dots and channel this action toward positive social goals.  The Haiti story is, without doubt, just as much a human story as it is  a story about new technologies. Come to think of it, these technologies  actually make us more human. Technology need not be dehumanizing. As  digital humanitarians in Haiti ably demonstrated, these new connection  technologies can extend and amplify our humanity, can translate our ini- tial  private  emotions  of  sadness  and  powerlessness  into  public—indeed  global—action to help others thousands of miles away.  DOING BATTLE WITH BIG DATA We were constantly overwhelmed with the vast amount of information  that  needed  to  be  monitored  and  processed—from  Twitter,  Facebook,  and YouTube, to mainstream news, television reports, radio broadcasts,  emails, and SMS. In fact, we were always behind and were never able to  catch up, especially when the text messages from Haiti started hitting our  inbox. As it turns out, more than 2 million tweets with the word Haiti or  Red Cross were posted within 48 hours of the earthquake.30 At one point,  Digicel had kindly oἀered to send out a “blast” SMS to all its mobile phone  subscribers  over 1.4 million people  to alert them of our SMS service and  crisis mapping eἀorts. We politely declined, as we could barely keep up  with the triaging of just a few thousand text messages a day.  While we kept training new volunteers on a daily basis, there remained  a rapidly growing backlog of hundreds of thousands of unread tweets, text  messages, emails, and more in our inbox. These were never read, never tri- aged, never mapped. While we didn’t know it at the time, what we had just  experienced was our first battle with Big Data—with Big Crisis Data. The  lesson was clear: an overflow of information and data can be as paralyzing  as the absence of it when it comes to mobilizing disaster response eἀorts.   The Rise of Digital Humanitarians     19  RISE OF DIGITAL HUMANITARIANS This book charts the sudden rise of digital humanitarians from the 2010  Haiti earthquake onward, including the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.  The following chapters describe how new digital sources of information  from social media to high-resolution satellite imagery, and new platforms  powered  by  advanced  computing  are  catapulting  digital  humanitarians  forward and defining the future of disaster response. Each chapter that fol- lows draws on real-world stories of digital humanitarians in action; short  stories that are as awe-inspiring as the digital humanitarian response to the  Haiti earthquake. Chapter 2 introduces the notion of Big  Crisis  Data and  addresses concerns around the use of Big Data for humanitarian response.  These include data bias, discrimination, false data, and threats to privacy.  The chapter draws on several stories to explain why two of the main chal- lenges for the future of digital humanitarian response are Big  Size  Data  and Big  False  Data. As such, the first two chapters of the book set the stage  for the main stories that follow. The first half of the book weaves in stories  about how digital humanitarians are dealing with Big  Crisis  Data while  the second half charts their eἀorts to verify Big  False  Data.  Chapter 3 begins with the digital humanitarian response to the Russian  fires of 2010, highlighting how crowdsourcing was used to catalyze cit- izen-based disaster response eἀorts both online and offline. The chap- ter then describes the launch of one of the first-ever global networks of  digital humanitarian volunteers—a group called the Standby Volunteer  Task  Force   SBTF .  The  chapter  depicts  how  the  SBTF  partnered  with  the United Nations  UN  in response to the Libya crisis. As a result of  these eἀorts, the UN co-founded and launched the Digital Humanitarian  Network  DHN . Today, the DHN serves as the official interface between  established humanitarian organizations and the growing number of dig- ital  volunteer  networks.  Chapter 3  describes  how  digital  humanitarian  volunteers  subsequently  adopted  a s marter  crowdsourcing  approach— called  crowd  computing  or  microtasking—to  make  sense  of  Big  Data  during disasters. The chapter highlights how the Digital Humanitarian  Network  used  this  approach  to  support  the  UN’s  humanitarian  relief  eἀorts in response to Typhoons in the Philippines.  Chapter 4 considers the application of microtasking to satellite imag- ery. The chapter begins with the crowdsearching eἀorts for a Malaysian  Airlines flight that went missing in 2014. While the scale of the crowdsearch    20     Digital Humanitarians   was  certainly  unprecedented,  the  use  of  microtasking  to  analyze  satel- lite imagery is hardly new. Chapter 4 recounts how the SBTF partnered  with the UN Refugee Agency to estimate the number of Somalis who had  been displaced due to drought and violence. The chapter then turns to  Zooniverse,  a  highly  successful  citizen  science  microtasking  platform,  and describes an exciting new project that applies microtasking wizardry  to analyze satellite imagery captured—in record time—by a new genera- tion of satellites. The chapter then turns to aerial imagery captured using  civilian unmanned aerial vehicles  UAVs , i.e., small, nonlethal drones. A  number of novel UAV projects following typhoons in the Philippines are  highlighted along with new microtasking eἀorts to analyze aerial imagery. Chapter 5 returns to social media as a source of Big Data and explains  why  microtasking  alone  may  only  be  part  of  the  solution.  The  chap- ter introduces concepts from advanced computing and artificial intelli- gence—such as data mining and machine learning—to explain how these  are already being used to make sense of Big Data during disasters. The  chapter highlights how digital humanitarians have been using these new  techniques in response to the crisis in Syria since 2011. We also visit the  American Red Cross’s Digital Operations Center following the massive  tornado that tore through Oklahoma in 2013. Chapter 5 then follows the  actions  of  digital  humanitarians  just  minutes  after  a l arge  earthquake  struck  Chile  in  early  2014.  The  chapter  concludes  by  highlighting  how  methods from artificial intelligence are also being used to make sense of  vast volumes of text messages  SMS  for humanitarian, development, and  public health projects.  Chapter 6 extends the use of artificial intelligence and machine learn- ing to the world of satellite and aerial imagery. Like previous chapters,  Chapter 6 draws on real-world humanitarian eἀorts to demonstrate—in  nontechnical language—the use of automated satellite imagery analysis  for disaster response. The chapter draws on examples from Haiti and the  Philippines  to  describe  the  latest  breakthroughs  in  automated  imagery  analysis. The chapter then highlights how these automated techniques are  also being applied to rapidly analyze aerial imagery captured by UAVs.  Again, real-world examples are presented using nontechnical terms.  Chapter 7  begins  to  tackle  the  challenge  of  Big   False   Data—that  is,  misinformation  and  disinformation  generated  on  social  media  during  disasters. The chapter opens with the verification challenges that digital  humanitarians faced in Libya and during elections in Russia. Chapter 7  then  outlines  concrete  strategies  for  the  verification  of  social  media  by    The Rise of Digital Humanitarians     21  drawing on the digital detective work of a seasoned investigative journal- ist during the Arab Spring. The chapter also highlights how Skype was  used in Kyrgyzstan to crowdsource the verification of rumors in real-time  during  a p eriod  of  acute  violence.  Next,  Chapter 7  highlights  the  most  eἀective strategies used by BBC journalists to verify user-generated con- tent. The chapter then considers the use of time-critical crowdsourcing to  verify social media during disasters, highlighting a novel and promising  new project inspired by the search for red weather balloons.  Chapter 8 highlights how artificial intelligence and machine learning  can be used to verify user-generated content posted on social media during  disasters. The chapter makes a case for combining traditional investigative  journalism strategies with new technologies powered by artificial intelli- gence. To outline the role that artificial intelligence and machine learning  can play in the verification process, the chapter draws on a unique study  of noncredible tweets posted during an earthquake in Chile. Results from  this and subsequent studies demonstrate that the credibility of tweets can  be predicted. Related studies that focus on terrorist attacks and a dozen  other high-profile events confirm that both fake tweets and images can be  automatically identified with a relatively high level of accuracy. The chap- ter concludes with an overview of a new project that enables anyone to  automatically compute the credibility of tweets.  Chapter 9 considers a diἀerent take on digital humanitarians by high- lighting  how  their  eἀorts  turn  to  digital  activism  in  countries  under  repressive rule. The chapter provides an intimate view into the activities of  digital humanitarians in the run-up to the Egyptian revolution and dur- ing the Libyan crisis, demonstrating how digital activists in Egypt crowd- sourced  citizen-based  humanitarian  convoys  into  Tripoli.  The  chapter  then highlights how digital activists from China and Iran are drawing on  civil resistance strategies when responding to disasters. The chapter con- cludes by suggesting that crowdsourced humanitarian response improves  nonviolent civil resistance, and vice versa.  The final chapter of the book begins by distilling some of the lessons  that digital humanitarians ought to learn from digital activists in repres- sive countries. These lessons and best practices highlight the importance  of having innovative policies in place and not just innovative technolo- gies.  The  importance  of  developing  forward-thinking  policy  solutions  pervades the concluding chapter, from the use of cell phone data to assess  the total number of individuals aἀected by a disaster, to democratizing  humanitarian technology by using spam filters and massive multiplayer    22     Digital Humanitarians   online games. Technology alone won’t solve the myriad challenges that  digital humanitarians face. Enlightened leadership and forward-thinking  policy making are equally—if not more important than—breakthroughs  in advanced computing. The chapter concludes by highlighting key trends  that are likely to define the next generation of digital volunteers.  THIS BOOK AND YOU This  book—which  is  ultimately  about  hope,  agency,  and  positive  social  change—does not assume or require any prior technical knowledge. I sim- ply share a series of short stories about digital humanitarians in action like  the one on Haiti. But the story of digital humanitarians does not end with  the last chapter of this book. You’ll find me continuing the stories on my  iRevolution.net blog, where I welcome your comments along with your  own stories of digital humanitarians in action. I am also continuing the  story on Twitter  @patrickmeier , where I welcome your thoughts on how  we can improve our collective online eἀorts now and in the years ahead. It seems like every day brings a new slate of headlines describing how  social media and related digital technologies are being used to cause harm  or violate our privacy, be they about repressive regimes arresting social  media users for their outspoken criticisms, or reports of Western democ- racies spying outright on their own citizens’ digital communications. This  book presents an alternative narrative, another possible world that already  exists—one in which we use new technologies to help each other during  disasters. Just imagine: if a bunch of students were able to create a live cri- sis map of Haiti and help save hundreds of lives without ever setting foot  in the country, then you too can make a diἀerence. Just be sure to avoid  making the mistakes we made! Reading this book will help.  In any event, you can support digital humanitarian eἀorts while reading  this book.

What does she see? Sparkles of electricity illumi- nate our major cities and continents. Our planet did not always look like  this, of course. The first light bulb began to shine in 1879. Before this, with  nightfall, the Earth was plunged in relative darkness punctuated by the  occasional lightning storm. Today, however, a satellite image of our planet  at night captures the pulse of our modern industrial heartbeat. But what if  our planet were lit up by information instead of light bulbs? What would  that pulse look like? Not much diἀerent at all, surprisingly.  More than a half-billion tweets are published by hundreds of millions of  people every day, but only 3% of these can be automatically mapped. The  reason is simple: only a very small percentage of Twitter users add their  location when sending a tweet. It is easy to include this information when  tweeting: one simply turns on the location feature on one’s smartphone or  computer. Recall from Chapter 1 that a tweet is just a public text message   SMS . If I switch on the location feature when tweeting, anyone reading  my public SMS will know more or less where in the world I am when send- ing that message. The vast majority of Twitter users do not reveal their  location, however, which explains why so few tweets can be automatically  mapped. While this may sound like an insignificant number, a little math  may change your mind: 3% of a half-billion tweets equals 15 million geo- tagged tweets every day  Figure 2.1 .  A recent empirical study found that the location of geo-tagged tweets  on a global map is highly correlated with the presence of electricity even  though so few tweets are geo-tagged.1 In other words, tweets are not only  confined to the world’s largest cities and urban hubs. Wherever there is  electricity, the chance that someone has tweeted from that location this  week is very high—and increasing every day. And, Twitter is not the only   25   26     Digital Humanitarians   FIGURE 2.1 Map of Tweets in the United States.  From MapD.   game in town. There are around 40 distinct social media channels being  used today—none of which existed 10 years ago. This is why the media  often  call  this  surge  in  digital  information  an  information  revolution.  While still relatively young and certainly imperfect, our social media net- works are beginning to form a new nervous system for our planet, captur- ing the pulse of our societies, and yes, crises, in real time.  More than a quarter-billion people were aἀected by disasters in 2010  alone.  Since  then,  the  number  of  new  mobile  phone  subscriptions  has  increased  by  well  over  1 b illion.  In  fact,  over  100  countries  now  have  more  mobile  phone  subscriptions  than  they  have  people.  In  addition,  more than 70% of Africa’s total population already subscribes to a mobile  phone service, while one in four individuals in low- and middle-income  countries already use the Internet, a figure set to double within the next  20 months. By the end of 2013, there were more mobile devices on Earth  than people. Close to 6 billion people will be smartphone users within  just  a f ew  years.2  Already,  more  people  around  the  world  have  access  to mobile phones than clean water or working toilets. And for the first  time ever, the Internet is now primarily accessed through mobile phones  rather than through regular desktop and laptop computers.3  In terms of social media, there are more than a billion Facebook users,  and some experts are still under the impression that the volume of “social    The Rise of Big  Crisis  Data     27  sharing” on Google+ may eventually overtake Facebook’s.4 Meanwhile,  Twitter has well over 200 million active users—a figure that almost dou- bled in 2012 alone, making it the fastest-growing social network at the  time. This may explain why 87% of all tweets ever posted since Twitter was  launched in 2006 were posted in just the past 24 months. Meanwhile, the  5-year-old instant messaging service WhatsApp has around a half-billion  users who post more than 50 billion messages a day—a stunning figure  that exceeds the total of text messages  SMS  sent worldwide every day.  On the multimedia side, Instagram has over 150 million active users who  post hundreds of millions of pictures every month. As for Flickr, more  than 50 new pictures are uploaded to the platform every second of every  day. Meanwhile, YouTube has close to a half-billion unique users, with 100  hours of new video footage added to the site every minute.5  It should come as no surprise, therefore, that major events like hurri- canes and earthquakes have an unmistakable impact on our new digi- tal  nervous  system.  More  than  20  million  disaster-related  tweets  were  posted when superstorm Sandy smashed through New York. In fact, the  number of shopping-related tweets skyrocketed just before the hurricane  made landfall as New Yorkers scrambled to stock up on food, water, and  batteries.6 In the days that followed, more than 1.3 million Sandy-related  pictures were posted online. A recent study of Flickr pictures uploaded  during Sandy found that the majority of them were posted the same hour  that the hurricane made landfall.7  What does this all mean for humanitarian response? Simply this: disaster- aἀected communities are increasingly becoming “digital communities” as  well; we are the sensors that light up our new digital nervous system when  disasters strike. Moreover, not only do more and more people around the  world turn to social media to communicate during disasters, but they also  use these and other platforms to self-organize in response to crises—often  faster and more efficiently than traditional humanitarian organizations.  This surge in information during disasters—Big  Crisis  Data—does not  magically solve all humanitarian challenges, however. Far from it, in fact.  The sheer size of Big Data makes it near impossible to make sense of in  the first place. What’s more, who’s to say whether any of those tweets were  relevant or credible—perhaps the majority of tweets relayed fake or mislead- ing information. Furthermore, the vast majority of the planet’s population  does not use social media. In other words, Big Data is highly discriminatory.  Finally, just because a few sources of Big  Crisis  Data are open and publicly  available doesn’t mean that using this information is either ethical or safe.   28     Digital Humanitarians   So do all these significant challenges spell the end for digital humani- tarians? Read on and decide for yourself. If you’re convinced that these  challenges can be overcome and already know how digital humanitarians  overcome these hurdles, then feel free to jump right into the next adven- ture in Chapter 3.  BIG  SIZE  DATA In  early  2012,  Filipinos  sent  an  average  of  2 b illion  text  messages  every  day, and more than 92% of Filipinos who are online have used Facebook.8  When disaster strikes, many of these SMS and Facebook posts relay relevant  information about the crisis and resulting needs. As for Twitter, well over a  quarter-million tweets were posted during the first 72 hours after Typhoon  Yolanda devastated large areas of the Philippines in 2013. During Hurricane  Sandy, more than a million Instagram pictures and over 20 million tweets  were posted within a 5-day period.9 In Japan, Twitter users posted more  than 177 million disaster-related tweets the day after the 2011 earthquake— the equivalent of 2,000 tweets per second.10 The numbers on other social  media platforms like Facebook and Instagram are equally astounding. This  all points to the fact that entire crowds are bearing witness to events large  and small thanks to the widespread use of mobile technologies. As my col- league Anand Giridharadas from The New York Times notes, these crowds  are not only collectively witnessing our world in real time, but their digital  footprints are also creating the first draft of history.11  Welcome to the age of Big Data. Big Data is often described as data that  are too large to analyze on a regular computer with common tools like the  popular spreadsheet application Microsoft Excel. So the bigness of Big Data  is relative to the computing power at our fingertips. The more sophisticated  our computing filters, the more data we’re able to filter, and thus the smaller  big data actually looks. Put diἀerently, Big Data is simply the result of “filter  failure.”12 If we had perfect filters, then Big Data would not exist.13  More technically, Big Data is often described as high-volume, -velocity,  and -variety data. Volume refers to the amount of data  20 million tweets  posted during Sandy , while velocity refers to the speed at which those  data are generated  over 2,000 tweets per second in Japan . Variety refers  to  the  variety  of  data  generated,  such  as  numerical   GPS  coordinates ,  textual  SMS , audio  phone calls , photographic  satellite imagery  and    The Rise of Big  Crisis  Data     29  videographic  YouTube . Sources of Big Data thus include both public and  private sources, such as images posted on public social media platforms   Instagram  on the one hand, and emails or phone calls on the other. Big  Data also relates to both raw data  such as individual Facebook updates   and meta-data  the exact time those updates were posted, for example .  FINDING NEEDLES IN BIG  SIZE  DATA Figure  2.2  is  not  a w eather  map  of  the  United  States  during  Hurricane  Sandy; rather, it is a “heat map” of tweets published during the superstorm.  The darker colors denote tweets that express negative sentiment, while the  lighter colors reflect tweets that relay more positive emotions and moods.  While this map is necessarily static, it is a screenshot taken from a YouTube  video that shows how people’s emotions changed in real time as Sandy made  its way up the East Coast of the United States.14 Social media networks are  increasingly forming a new nervous system for our planet. And while this  nervous system is still imperfect and very young—only 14% of the world’s  population is on Facebook, 3% on Twitter—the system is evolving more  quickly than any other nervous system in human history.  FIGURE 2.2 Heatmap of Sandy-related Tweets.  From Tweetbeat.    30     Digital Humanitarians   Of course, this doesn’t mean that most of the 20 million tweets posted  during Hurricane Sandy were relevant for disaster response. Thousands of  school kids were probably posting tweets that happily informed everyone  that classes were canceled due to the heavy rains. So exactly how many  tweets published during a disaster are actually relevant, informative, and  helpful for humanitarian response? Maybe 1 in 10, or perhaps 1 in 20?  The answer varies quite a bit. In the case of the Joplin tornado of 2011  in Missouri, about 10% of tweets posted in the wake of the tornado were  considered relevant and informative for disaster response organizations.15  During the Australian bushfires in 2009, some 65% of tweets contained  information deemed important for emergency response.16 These percent- ages are perhaps unusually high. And yet, even if only 0.001% of the 20  million tweets posted during Hurricane Sandy were relevant for disaster  response, and only half of those were more or less reliable, this would still  mean a total of 15,000 words or 30 pages of relevant, real-time, and freely  available crisis information.  Now, these 15,000 words only represent 0.0005% of all the words posted  on Twitter during Hurricane Sandy. This means that 99% of all the tweets  generated during the hurricane could well have been totally useless for  disaster response. Yet while the vast majority of tweets, Facebook updates,  Instagram pictures, etc., may not be useful for disaster responders and  crisis-aἀected communities, a very small fraction of these often prove to  be invaluable. How invaluable? Literally life-saving, as Naoko was to find  out on March 11, 2011.17  Along with hundreds of others, Naoko had fled the incoming tsunami  by climbing to the rooftop of a community center in her small coastal  town in northern Japan. While she wasn’t able to make a call or send an  SMS  with  her  phone,  she  realized  that  her  emails  were  still  accessible.  So she quickly emailed her husband, who in turn emailed their son in  London. Upon reading the email, Naoko’s son sent the deputy governor of  Tokyo a private tweet to ask for help. The latter saw the tweet and called  the Tokyo Fire Department to arrange for helicopter rescue. Shortly there- after, Naoko and hundreds of others who were stranded with her at the  crumbling community center were rescued.  Most  were  not  as  lucky  as  Naoko,  however.  Most  people  don’t  know  the deputy governor of Tokyo well enough to send him a private tweet.  Indeed, private tweets only work if two Twitter users decide to subscribe to  each other’s tweets—and most people on Twitter are quite selective about  whose  feeds  they  subscribe  to.  So  tweets  are  not  typically  private,  but    The Rise of Big  Crisis  Data     31  rather public, and are often drowned out in the massive deluge of public  tweets generated during disasters. Over 2,000 public tweets were posted  every second after the Japan earthquake, for example.18 But which ones  were urgent calls for help? And which of these could have been used to  alert people nearby? The challenge here is akin to finding a needle in a  haystack, which is of course no easy task. But this is a challenge we must  solve, for the proverbial needle may contain life-saving information.  As  the  International  Federation  of  the  Red  Cross   IFRC   recognized  almost a decade ago, access to information is equally important as access  to food, water, and shelter. But information is the most perishable of these  commodities. To be sure, information that disaster responders receive at  any  given  time  may  no  longer  be  useful  or  accurate  just  minutes  later.  As one colleague put it, “If you have ‘accurate’ information that is hours  old, you do not have accurate information in the social media world.” The  challenge thus facing traditional humanitarian organizations and disas- ter-aἀected communities alike is how to find those “needles in a haystack”  and do so in real time. Indeed, time is a luxury that humanitarian organi- zations and disaster-aἀected communities do not have during crises.  One response to this challenge might as well be: “Forget it.” The vast  majority of social media reports are useless to humanitarians anyways.  But in that case, libraries are also useless to you—bar the few books you’re  looking for, but those rarely represent more than 1% of all the books avail- able in a major library. Does that mean libraries are useless? Of course not.  Is social media useless for disaster response? Of course not, and certainly  not to Naoko, who is still alive today thanks to social media.  POLICY, NOT SIMPLY TECHNOLOGY The challenge here is not simply a technical one, however. That is, this  needle-in-a-haystack problem is not one that can be solved with advanced  computing  alone.  There  is  an  important  policy  angle  here  that  should  not  be  overlooked.  If  governments  and  humanitarian  organizations  do  not actively or explicitly create demand for relevant, findable, and high- quality social media content during disasters, then why should supply of  high-quality data follow? If the 911 emergency telephone number in the  United States  999 in the UK  were never advertised, then would anyone  call  this  crowdsourcing  service?19  If  911  were  simply  a  voicemail  inbox    32     Digital Humanitarians   with no instructions, would callers know what type of relevant, actionable  information to relay after the beep?  A step in the right direction, in this respect, is the Filipino government’s  proactive  attitude.  Three  days  before  Typhoon  Pablo  made  landfall  in  December 2012, the government directly and publicly encouraged Filipinos  to  use  the  PabloPH  Twitter  hashtag  for  important  updates.  Twitter  hashtags simply serve as bookmarks or signposts to quickly find tweets that  relate to a particular topic, or typhoon in this case. In other words, hashtags  make  the  needles  in  our  haystack  more  findable.  The  government’s  offi- cial Twitter handle  @govph  also tweeted messages from The presidential  Communications Development and Strategic Planning Office. In one such  tweet, the office encouraged those on Twitter to use diἀerent hashtags for  diἀerent purposes, such as ReliefPH and RescuePH. The latter served to  flag tweets that relayed information about rescue needs. This directive mim- ics the use of official emergency numbers for diἀerent needs, e.g., police, fire,  ambulance, etc. In sum, if disaster responders and emergency management  professionals are not content with the quality and quantity of relevant infor- mation on social media, then they should do something about it by imple- menting appropriate policies that actually create demand for higher-quality  and more structured reporting. This explains why the United Nations used  standardized hashtags in response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa.20   This won’t solve all the challenges that come with Big  Crisis  Data, of  course. Even if we’re somehow able to quickly find life-saving information  posted on social media during disasters, not everyone is on social media. In  fact, the vast majority of the planet’s population has never used Facebook  or Twitter. For example, only 16% of Americans are on Twitter, and this  demographic is younger, more urban, and more affluent than the norm. To  this end, information found on social media during disasters is simply not  representative of who needs the most help. It is also subjective. Worse still,  the information could be false or based on rumors. So, why bother looking  for information in a giant stack of potentially fake social media reports?  BIG  FALSE  DATA Perhaps the single biggest concern that humanitarians express vis-à-vis user- generated content shared on social media during disasters is this: “Can we  really trust social media? What if the information is false?” So even if a solution    The Rise of Big  Crisis  Data     33  can be found to overcome filter failure and thus make sense of Big  Size  Data,  a second major problem is veracity. As a result of false information, urgent  humanitarian aid could be allocated to the wrong area, for example, which  could result in wasted time and resources; at worst, it could cost lives.  Remember  that  misleading  tweet  about  the  Napley  Inn  Hotel  in  Chapter 1? We were urgently looking for the location of potential survivors  following the earthquake in Haiti. An American search and rescue team  in Port-au-Prince had gotten word that survivors were still trapped under  the rubble near a hotel called the Napley Inn. Alas, we simply couldn’t find  any sign of this hotel, so we asked for help on Twitter. An hour or so later,  we received a tweet back from a complete stranger who urged us to look  for the Holiday Inn Hotel instead since Napley Inn was supposedly owned  by the Holiday Inn chain. And so we did, which sent us oἀ on a wild digi- tal goose chase across the wrong part of town.  Unfortunately, this was only the first of many such incidents that fol- lowed.  When  the  Chilean  earthquake  struck  Santiago  and  neighbor- ing areas just weeks after Haiti’s earthquake, the following message was  posted on Twitter:  chile please help, I am buried under the rubble in my home at [address  removed for privacy] Santiago, Chile. chile my phone doesn’t work about  10 hours. . . .  This  tweet  was  quickly  added  to  the  Chile  Crisis  Map,  which  I ha d  launched  just  hours  after  the  earthquake   more  on  that  in  Chapter 8 .  Someone in Chile saw the tweet and actually called the police that evening  to report that a person was trapped under the rubble at the stated address,  and the police dispatched dozens of officers to the location. Here’s what  happened next:  It was Saturday night in Santiago and even if there had been one of the  worst earthquake of the last 25 years, life was still going on. So it was for  [names removed for privacy], a couple that was celebrating that night its 39  wedding anniversary [sic]. Of course, there was not much to celebrate, so  at 11pm Pedro and Elba were preparing to go to bed. They lived in [address  removed  for  privacy],  Santiago,  Chile  [the  same  address  posted  on  the  tweet]. When the door was open by force by police, carabineros and detec- tives, with the chief of Security in person leading the operation, the couple  almost had a heart attack. No person to rescue, only an old couple which is  going to remember its 39 anniversary for the rest of its life!21   34     Digital Humanitarians   This was unfortunately not an isolated incident. The same Twitter user   a.k.a. jerk  who had posted the tweet published a second false message the  following day, which was unfortunately published on the Chile Crisis Map:  plz send help to [address removed for privacy] Santiago, Chile, i’m stuck  under building with my child. hitsunami chile we have no supplies.  Again, the police mobilized to the location. But none of the buildings in  that part of the city had collapsed, so they promptly left. This time, though,  the tweet actually ended up on hundreds of t-shirts as part of a fundrais- ing campaign for the Red Cross  Figure 2.3 . Both tweets cost the Chilean  police time and resources to coordinate the response—time and resources  that could have been used to save people who were actually in need of res- cue. What if the next time a disaster strikes Chile this police chief decides to  ignore tweets coming from people who genuinely need urgent help?  Haiti and Chile are not outliers when it comes to Big  False  Data. During  Hurricane Sandy, over 10,000 tweets posted fake photographs—often the  same dozen pictures.22 In 2013, the Syrian Electronic Army hacked into  the Associated Press’s Twitter account and tweeted that the White House  had been attacked. The news went viral and briefly wiped out over $130   FIGURE 2.3 T-shirt of false disaster tweet used in fundraising.   The Rise of Big  Crisis  Data     35  billion from the stock market. Access to information during disasters is  equally important as access to food, but no one wants rotten or poisoned  food, which is what false information is. Much of Big Crisis Data is user  generated and shared on social media. So who’s to say whether any of that  information is reliable?  UNPACKING BIG  FALSE  DATA This serious problem needs to be unpacked and placed into context. For  example, humanitarians often draw on the mainstream media to inform  their decisions during relief operations. To be sure, “Media reports can  significantly influence allocations, often more than directly transmitted  community statements of need, because they are more widely read or bet- ter trusted.”23 But professional journalists do get it wrong sometimes.  Take The New York Times, for example. This newspaper is considered  by many in the Western, English-speaking world as a gold standard, and  the perfect example of high-quality journalism—the cream of the crop,  the best of the best. And yet, The New York Times has to make some 7,000  corrections to its articles every year.24 All of a sudden, the gold standard  of journalism isn’t looking very golden. And The New York Times is defi- nitely not the only media organization that makes thousands of factual  errors  every  year.  A h igh-profile  study  found  that  “over  60  percent  of  the articles in a group of 14 newspapers contained some kind of error.”25  Those who followed the media coverage during the Boston bombings in  2013 are probably not surprised by these statistics. In their rush to be the  first to report on the tragedy, a number of mainstream media organiza- tions jumped to wrong conclusions, which had serious consequences.26  In sum, the mainstream media are hardly perfect, something we can all  observe on a daily basis.  And so it behooves us to ask the question “Compared to what?” when  discussing the unreliability of social media. What about emergency report- ing systems that we assume work well even though we can’t actually assess  how reliable they really are? Take 911 in the United States and 999 in the  UK. These formal emergency number systems are crowdsourcing systems.  They crowdsource alerts and calls for help from the crowd. Do emergency  operators always receive 100% accurate, fully verified information?   36     Digital Humanitarians   CALLING 911 AND 999 The first emergency number  999  was launched in London on June 30,  1937. That first week, a total of 1,336 emergency calls were made to 999.  Out  of  these,  1,073  were  genuine  emergencies,  171  simply  wanted  the  operator, and 91 were jokes or hoax calls.27 So about 10% of all calls to 999  during that first week of service were made to deliberately provide false  information. In contrast, only 0.5% of tweets published during Hurricane  Sandy linked to fake pictures.  Today in the UK, less than a quarter of daily calls made to the police  “turned  out  to  be  real  emergencies,  and  many  were  pranks  or  fakes.  Some were just plain stupid.”28 This amounts to well over 5 million false  or hoax calls per year; that’s more than 13,000 calls per day on average.  Meanwhile, in New York City, 911 operators received about 10,000 false  calls today.29 Assuming it takes 5 seconds to handle each of these calls, 911  operators waste 14 hours every day having to manage these inappropri- ate calls. That’s over 5,000 hours a year  or the equivalent of 200 days  of  wasted time. In Continental Europe, about half of all calls made to emer- gency numbers are false hoax calls, with the Greeks leading the pack with  a staggering 99% of all their calls being false hoax calls.30  Law enforcement agencies also face another daunting challenge: diver- sionary  calls.  Used  by  criminals,  diversionary  calls  seek  to  send  the  police to a location where no emergency has occurred, thus diverting law  enforcement away from the caller’s criminal operation. Yet another chal- lenge: exaggerated emergency calls. Callers at times intentionally exagger- ate the seriousness of an emergency to elicit a more rapid response from  the police.31 The list of problems with emergency telephone numbers goes  on and on, but these issues are rarely visible because emergency calls are  private—as they should be. In contrast, social media is completely public,  thus lending itself to greater public scrutiny. The flaws of social media are  far more apparent due to its open nature. This biases our attitudes, mak- ing us perceive social media reports as highly untrustworthy compared to  emergency calls, which we wrongly assume are far more reliable.  Point being: despite these massive data quality issues, U.S. and European  law enforcement agencies have not abandoned the use of crowdsourcing.  Why?  Because  these  emergency  services  serve  as  information  lifelines;  even if the majority of calls are false or hoaxes, the ones that are genuine  do save lives. In other words, the benefits of these emergency numbers still    The Rise of Big  Crisis  Data     37  far outweigh the costs. This calculus is unlikely to change as agencies in  the United States and elsewhere shift toward more mobile-based solutions  like the use of SMS and geo-referenced multimedia messages  MMS  for  911.32 MMSs are simply pictures or videos sent by cell phones via SMS. In  sum, instead of giving up on 911, which would be folly, law enforcement  agencies are seeking to find better ways to manage the problem of false  calls. And they’ll have to do the same with SMS.33  Of course, questioning the reliability of emergency calls and mainstream  news does not solve the challenge of Big False Data on social media. It sim- ply puts the challenge in perspective. Just as law enforcement agencies are  finding new ways to manage the false data problem, so are digital humani- tarians vis-à-vis social media. Perhaps in the future it will be illegal to  report false crisis-related information via social media just as it is today  for 911 and 999. Until then, even if advanced computing can help digital  humanitarians verify user-generated content shared on social media dur- ing disasters  Chapters 7 and 8 , this still leaves another major challenge:  bias. As noted earlier, not everyone is on social media. In fact, social media  users tend to represent a very distinct demographic, one that is younger,  more urban, and more affluent than the norm.  BIG  BIAS  DATA EXPOSED A  police  officer  sees  a ma n  searching  the  ground  for  his  keys  under  a  streetlight late at night. After helping for several minutes, the exasperated  officer asks if the man is sure that he lost his key there. The man says, “No,  I lost them in the park a few blocks down the street.” Incredulous, the  officer asks why in the world he’s searching under the streetlight. The man  replies, “Well this is where the light is.”  This parable describes the streetlight eἀect, the bias that results from  using the easiest or most convenient way to collect information. The street- light eἀect is an important criticism leveled against the use of Big Data for  humanitarian response. Although the concern is valid, like the worry over  Big False Data, it needs to be unpacked and placed into context.  Before emergency telephone numbers existed, one would simply pick up  the receiver, dial 0, and tell the operator: “Get me the police!” In fact, oper- ators were the first point of contact for emergency calls. They would keep  lists of specific numbers in their local towns  of local fire departments,    38     Digital Humanitarians   local doctors, etc. , for example. Of course, you could try and call the local  fire department yourself, but those numbers weren’t well known or adver- tised in those days. And it could take a long time to get a line through,  as happened on a tragic day in London in November 1935, when a house  fire claimed five women’s lives. While the fire raged, a neighbor across the  street tried to phone the fire brigade but was put on hold by the telephone  operator system, as all operators were busy handling other callers. Can  you imagine being placed on hold indefinitely when calling an emergency  number? The neighbor was positively outraged and wrote the following  letter to the editor of The Times:  Awakened by cries of “Fire,” I rushed to the window, saw smoke coming  from the windows of 27, Wimpole Street, almost opposite my own house  and could hear groans. In a matter of seconds, I picked up my telephone  and dialed “0.” Ringing tone was immediately audible, which continued  while someone . . . ran to the nearest alarm in the street and summoned  the fire brigade. The engines responded incredibly quickly, but by the time  they reached the house I still had had no response from the . . . telephone  exchange. It seemed entirely futile to continue holding on and listening to  ringing tone, which awakened no response, but I am still wondering how  long I would have had to wait had there been no one to run to the fire alarm  in the street.34  Another reader’s letter to the editor was more blunt: “‘In Emergencies  Dial O’ is little more than a farce.” In any event, the incident resulted in  major public outcry and prompted a full government inquiry.35 As a result,  London became the first city in the world to deploy a dedicated emergency  number  system   999   on  June  30,  1937.  The  service  was  introduced  in  Glasgow the following year, but it ultimately took four decades before the  999 service was truly available nationwide. In 1959, the city of Winnipeg,  Canada, was the first city in North America to use the 911 system, while  Alabama and Alaska were the first U.S. states to use the 911 number about  a decade later. It wasn’t until 20 years after that, however, that 911 was  adopted as the standard number across most of the country.  It thus took decades for these numbers to become truly available within  the UK and United States. This means that the vast majority of calls received  during this time were biased and not representative of all possible alerts since  only those who had access to the service could call. Does this mean that the  millions of calls made to 999 and 911 before the emergency systems were  truly available nationwide were invalid or useless? Of course not, they still    The Rise of Big  Crisis  Data     39  saved many lives. For decades, 911 and 999 emergency numbers discrimi- nated  outright  against  people  who  were  deaf  since  Telecommunications  Devices for the Deaf  TDDs  were not invented until the 1960s and 1970s.  Does  this  mean  these  emergency  services  should  have  been  phased  out?  Of course not; we should simply develop technological solutions to extend  these communication lifelines to those who are hard of hearing—like me!  One such solution in the U.S. is the ability to text 911 for help. As the Federal  Communications  Commission   FCC   notes,  “Text-to-911  can  provide  a  lifesaving alternative in a number of diἀerent situations, such as where a  person who is deaf, hard of hearing, or has a speech disability is unable to  make a voice call.”36 While the FCC has mandated that all wireless carriers  must support text-to-911, only 2% of emergency call centers are currently  equipped to receive 911 texts.37 So this new solution is highly discrimina- tory. Does this mean we should abolish this new service? Of course not.  So let’s be honest here: there has never been a moment in human history  in which everyone has had access to the same communication technology,  service, or medium at the same time.  While social media suἀers from sample bias, this is often true of official  humanitarian  data  as  well.  As  one  humanitarian  professional  candidly  noted during an interview, “When we do assessments, we drive around  and look with our eyes and we talk to people and we assess what’s on the  ground and that’s how we make our evaluations.”38 Like social media, on- the-ground assessments can be informative, but no one can possibly claim  that driving around looking for people to talk to will yield an unbiased  sample. And this is by no means a special case.  The UN, for example, typically carries out an initial 2-week “rapid sur- vey” to assess damage and needs following a disaster. They do this by car- rying out in-person interviews in the disaster-aἀected areas. The findings  from this survey are then written up in what is called the MIRA Report,  which stands for Multicluster Initial Rapid Assessment. The MIRA Report  for Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines is well worth a read, particularly  the  section  that  describes  some  of  the  data’s  limitations:  the  data  col- lected were not representative; the process of selecting interviewees for the  interviews was biased given that said selection was based on convenience;  interviewees often had to guesstimate the answer for several questions,  thus introducing additional bias in the data; and since assessment teams  were not trained on how to administer the questionnaire, this introduced  further bias, which in turn limits the ability to compare survey results.  Lastly, the report notes that the data still need to be validated.39   40     Digital Humanitarians   In other words, bias is not some strange disease that only afflicts user- generated  content  share  on  social  media,  so  the  double  standards  are  unwarranted. Despite the substantial data bias issues, the MIRA Report is  still used to inform relief eἀorts and relieve suἀering. The fact that infor- mation shared on social media may not be representative or immediately  verifiable does not invalidate or devalue this information. Moreover, much  of the data used for medical research, digital disease detection, and police  work are not representative.40 And yet they still save many lives. Every day.  Thus, despite the very real challenges of bias and subjectivity, social media  still represents “new, large, and arguably unfiltered insights into attitudes  and behaviors that were previously difficult to track in the wild.”41  In sum, “arguing that Big Data isn’t all it’s cracked up to be is a straw- man, pure and simple—because no one should think it’s magic to begin  with.”42  My  humanitarian  colleagues  certainly  don’t  think  Big  Data  is  magic. They live in the real world where the vast majority of data they have  access to are unrepresentative, messy, and imperfect—hence the impor- tance of drawing on as many diἀerent sources of information as possible,  including social media, to cross-reference and augment situational aware- ness. Today’s disaster responders are becoming “information DJs”—they  collect information from traditional and nontraditional sources and do  their  best  to  create  a r easonably  accurate  picture  of  the  situation.  This  explains why some 80 years after the London fire of 1935, the London Fire  Brigade is launching a new emergency service that allows the crowd to  report fire emergencies via Twitter.43  TO TWEET, OR NOT TO TWEET A  recent  survey  by  the  American  Red  Cross  revealed  that  over  three- fourths of Americans expect disaster response organizations to respond  to their needs when they share them on social media.44 And most of these  social media users expect relief to arrive within an hour after posting their  needs. As such, social media is simply another lifeline  not the only one   in the ecosystem of crisis information. It does not replace 911 and other  official information services.  A  related  misconception  about  Big  Crisis  Data  is  that  marginalized  communities that aren’t tweeting won’t receive help during disasters. One  popular observation, for example, is the revelation that some marginalized    The Rise of Big  Crisis  Data     41  neighborhoods in New York—like some areas in the Rockaways—posted  very few tweets during Hurricane Sandy. But 911 does not suddenly become  unavailable as a communication lifeline just because disaster responders  are  also  monitoring  Twitter.  And  yet,  some  critics—mainly  academics  with no experience in humanitarian response—mistakenly assume that  emergency responders will ignore all other traditional sources of informa- tion in favor of social media during disasters. This is factually incorrect,  and falsely implies that marginalized communities have no access to other  communication lifelines if they’re not active on social media.  In any event, the fact that very few tweets came from the Rockaways  neighborhood  in  New  York  during  Hurricane  Sandy  can  be  valuable  information for disaster responders. To be sure, monitoring social media  footprints during disasters can help humanitarians get a b etter picture  of the “negative space” and thus infer what they might be missing. Say,  for example, that there were about 1,000 daily tweets coming from the  Rockaways in the weeks leading up to the hurricane but few to no tweets  after the hurricane. This negative space in and of itself sends a signal to  humanitarians—the  area  may  not  have  any  electricity  or  it  may  have  been evacuated. Either way, this signal provides humanitarians with an  issue to investigate. Moreover, those few tweets that are posted from the  Rockaways could still provide invaluable information on how that neigh- borhood has been aἀected.  In  contrast,  if  there  were  5,000  daily  tweets  coming  from  Brooklyn  before the storm and the same number of tweets following Sandy, then  one might infer that the situation is not critical. On the other hand, if there  were 3,000 tweets coming from Queens before Sandy and now 30,000, this  may indicate that Twitter users are communicating about the disaster and  potentially resulting needs. But I am merely speculating here and would  need to investigate further using other information sources to confirm  just how hard Queens was hit. To this end, social media can serve as a  “tip line” or a springboard for follow-up damage and needs assessments.  As my colleague Andrew Zolli is fond of saying, “We share the world by  the questions we ask.” One of the most valuable aspects of Big Data for  humanitarian response is that it helps us ask important questions when  coordinating disaster relief.  Finally, the contours of a community’s social media footprint during a  disaster can shed light on how neighboring areas that are not on social  media may have been aἀected. To be sure, if I have no electricity and my  backyard looks like a lake while the street in front of my house is blocked    42     Digital Humanitarians   with  fallen  trees  and  floating  debris,  then  chances  are  that  my  elderly  neighbors across the street may also be lighting candles or looking for  batteries. And even though they’re not on social media, my tweets on the  disaster damage will shed light on the negative space across the street. So  these digital border regions are particularly important.  When I recently spoke about this with UN colleagues in Geneva, includ- ing Andrej Verity from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian  Aἀairs, they fully agreed with this line of reasoning and even added that  they already apply “good enough” methods of inference with traditional cri- sis data. Furthermore, it should be noted that a number of methods do exist  to correct for bias, in both traditional and social media datasets. These do  not always work, of course. The point is simply that humanitarians are not  powerless vis-à-vis the bias challenge, nor are they under any illusion that  the majority of data they deal with is unbiased. Perfect, representative data  are no more than a Quixotic dream, which explains why humanitarian col- leagues seek good enough datasets and methods.  HOW MANY TWEETS ARE ENOUGH? After  Typhoon  Pablo  devastated  the  Philippines  in  2012,  the  UN  used  images and videos shared on social media as a preliminary way to assess  the disaster damage  see Chapter 3 . According to one senior UN official  I spoke with, their relief eἀorts would have overlooked certain disaster- aἀected  areas  had  it  not  been  for  eyewitnesses  sharing  information  on  social media. Was this information representative? No. Were the underly- ing images and videos objective? No, they captured the perspective of those  taking the pictures. But the damage captured by this information was not  virtual; it was unfortunately very real. This explains why a high-profile and  official policy document published by the United Nations in 2013 stated  the following: “The evidence suggests that new information sources are no  less representative or reliable than more traditional sources, which are also  imperfect in crisis settings.”45 And it only takes one person to take a picture  of a washed-out bridge to reveal the infrastructure damage caused by a  typhoon, even if all other onlookers have never heard of Twitter.  So  how  many  tweets  are  enough  to  make  them  useful  for  disaster  response? Put diἀerently, how large does a community’s social media foot- print have to be to adequately inform relief operations? Recent research    The Rise of Big  Crisis  Data     43  has  shown  that  “micro-crises,”  like  car  accidents,  can  be  automatically  detected on Twitter even though these incidents elicit very few tweets.46 In  Haiti, colleagues at Harvard University found that the analysis of tweets  from the country could have detected an outbreak of cholera well before  the government.47 In contrast, however, the Pakistan earthquake of 2013  struck a remote area where there was virtually no local social media foot- print.  In  these  contexts,  social  media  is  of  no  added  value  whatsoever  since eyewitnesses are not sharing their observations using this medium.  But social media can be complemented by other digital sources, like local  news media, which is almost always available online these days.48  Recent studies also show that despite the existing bias and the possibil- ity of false information, social media can still provide strong and mean- ingful signals. Indeed, a s tudy in Indonesia showed that an analysis of  specific tweets could accurately forecast food price changes in the coun- try,49 while another study in Ireland showed that analyzing tweets that  express worry and job-related stress could correctly predict increases in  subsequent  unemployment.50  In  Egypt,  a s tudy  showed  that  increased  politicization, and indeed violence, was correlated with specific types of  content shared on Twitter.51 Furthermore, a study of tweets posted during  the major UK floods of 2012 showed that the location of Twitter users who  included the word flood in their tweets closely reflected the actual loca- tions of floods and flood alerts.52 In sum, even though social media may  be biased, unverified, and at times false—like 911 calls and humanitarian  surveys—some relevant and meaningful signals can still be gleaned from  crowdsourced information. And so, while our nervous system is still very  young, even premature in places, and certainly imperfect in representa- tion, it is still capturing the pulse of society in important ways.  THE DEMOGRAPHIC GAME Demographic trends will also influence the question of bias and represen- tation over time. While only ~12 million Filipinos  13% of the country   live in the capital Manila, it is worth noting that urban populations across  the world are booming. In about 2,000 days, more than half of the popu- lation in the world’s developing regions will be living in urban areas.53  Meanwhile, the rural population of developing countries will decline by a  half billion in coming decades. At the same time, these rural populations    44     Digital Humanitarians   will also contribute to growing a larger social media footprint since 89%  of urban communities in developing countries already have some kind  of access to mobile phones.54 With Google and Facebook making it their   for-profit  mission to connect those oἀ the digital grid by using satellites  and unmanned aerial vehicles  UAVs , among other technologies, it is just  a matter of time until very rural communities get online.55  The radical increase in population density also means that urban areas  will become even more vulnerable to major disasters  hence the Rockefeller  Foundation’s program on 100 Resilient Cities .56 To be sure, as philosopher  Jean-Jacques Rousseau noted in a letter to Voltaire after the massive 1756  Portugal earthquake, “An earthquake occurring in wilderness would not  be important to society.”57 In other words, disaster risk is a function of  population density. At the same time, however, a denser population also  means more proverbial streetlights. But just as we don’t need 100 street- lights at every road intersection to find our way at night, we hardly need  everyone to be on social media for tweets and Instagram pictures to shed  some light during disasters.  My good friend Jaroslav Valůch recently recounted a conversation he  had with an old fireman in a very small town in Eastern Europe. This  fireman had never heard of Twitter, Facebook, or crowdsourcing. But the  old man said: “During crisis, for us, the firemen, it is like having a dark  house where only some rooms are lit. What you do [with social media and  crowdsourcing] is that you are lighting up more rooms for us. So don’t  worry, it is enough.” In sum, social media helps us shed some light and at  the same time prompts us to ask important questions that may not other- wise be posed.  MANAGING BIG  RISK  DATA On  December  23,  2012,  the  suburban  New  York  newspaper  The  Journal  News  launched  a d igital  map  that  displayed  the  names  and  addresses  of  33,614 handgun permit holders in two counties of New York. Entitled “The  Gun Owner Next Door,” the interactive map sought to highlight the extent  of gun proliferation in the wake of the horrific school shooting in Newtown,  Connecticut, a few weeks earlier. The digital map, which drew on publicly  available data, was viewed well over a million times in just a few weeks. The  backlash against The Journal News was swift, loud, and intense.   The Rise of Big  Crisis  Data     45  The interactive map included the names and addresses of police officers  and other law enforcement officials such as prison guards. Inmates used the  map to find out exactly where the guards lived and subsequently threatened  them. Former crooks and thieves also confirmed that the map would be  highly valuable for planning crimes such as robberies. They also warned  that criminals could easily use the map to either target houses with no guns   to avoid getting shot  or take the risk and steal the weapons themselves  since shotguns and handguns have a street value of $300 to $400 per gun.  The  consequences  of  publishing  the  gun  map  didn’t  end  there.  Law- abiding citizens who did not own guns began to fear for their safety. A  Democratic legislator told the media, “I never owned a gun but now I have  no choice. . . . I have been exposed as someone that has no gun. And I’ll do  anything, anything to protect my family.”58 There were also consequences  for the journalists who published the map. They began to receive death  threats and had to station an armed guard outside one of their offices. One  disenchanted blogger decided to turn the tables by publishing an online  map with the names and addresses of key editorial staἀers who work at  the newspaper. Soon, the location of the editors’ children’s schools had  also  been  mapped.  Suspicious  packages  containing  white  powder  were  mailed to the newsroom  later found to be harmless .  After weeks of fierce and heated debate, the newspaper took the map down.  Incidentally, it later turned out the gun ownership data were highly inac- curate.59 But were the journalists right in publishing their interactive gun  map in the first place? There was nothing illegal about it. But should the map  have been published? In the same vein, just because some Big Data—like  social media reports shared during disasters—is publicly available doesn’t  mean that using this information is either ethical or without danger.  This  explains  why  I p ublicly  called  for  a c ode  of  conduct  less  than  2  months after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. If you recall from Chapter 1, we  had decided to make public social media reports and urgent text messages  that Haitians were sending us. This was to help inform as many responders  as possible—particularly Haitians in the Diaspora who were very active in  the relief eἀorts.60 The reason I called for a code of conduct shortly after the  Haiti earthquake was because there was no official, readily accessible docu- ment to guide the eἀorts of digital humanitarians in this respect. I actively  pursued these eἀorts over the next 3 years and co-authored GSMA’s official  code of conduct for the use of SMS in disaster response, which was pub- lished in early 2013.61 GSMA is the Global Association of Mobile Operators,  representing more than 800 mobile phone companies around the world.   46     Digital Humanitarians   This  code  of  conduct  was  consulted  extensively  during  the  response  to  Typhoon Yolanda, which devastated the Philippines later that year. Just a few  months after GSMA’s publication was launched, the International Committee  of  the  Red  Cross   ICRC   published  its  revised  data  protection  protocols,  which, for the first time ever, included a chapter written specifically for digi- tal humanitarians.62 This was not a coincidence. Several colleagues and I had  reached out to the ICRC for its guidance on data protection the year before  and provided detailed feedback on early versions of that chapter. Finally, just  weeks before Typhoon Yolanda struck the Philippines, my colleagues and I  published a set of key principles for the ethical use of Big Data.63  While the topic of Big Data and ethics could easily fill this entire book,  suffice it to say that digital humanitarians today do have official guide- lines they can draw on to ensure they “do no harm” when using Big Data  for disaster response. Of course, these are just guidelines—they are not  directly enforceable, at least not for the moment. So the best we can do is  hold ourselves accountable and learn from our mistakes.  But there is another equally important observation that needs to be made  here. The importance of privacy during crises can—and already has—been  hijacked by attention-seeking hypocrites  and trolls  who sensationalize the  issue to gain personal notoriety and paralyze action. But nonaction in no  way implies no harm. Quite to the contrary, nonaction can result in the  greatest harm during disasters. Moreover, as The New York Times rightly  noted after the gun map:  When it comes to privacy, we are all hypocrites. We howl when a newspaper  publishes public records about personal behavior. At the same time, we are  acquiescing in a much more sweeping erosion of our privacy—government  surveillance, corporate data-mining, political micro-targeting, hacker inva- sions—with no comparable outpouring of protest. As a society we have no  coherent view of what information is worth defending and how to defend  it. When our personal information is exploited this way, we may grumble,  or we may seek the largely false comfort of tweaking our privacy settings.64  TAKING BIG  DECISIONS  DATA There’s a popular argument going around that Big Data on its own will  improve and accelerate decision making during humanitarian disasters.    The Rise of Big  Crisis  Data     47  Alas, numerous studies over the years have revealed that many decisions  made  by  humanitarian  professionals  during  disasters  are  not  based  on  any kind of empirical evidence—regardless of how large or small a dataset  may be, and even when those data are fully trustworthy. As one recent  humanitarian  policy  report  confirms,  decisions  during  disasters  are  at  times “made on the basis of anecdote rather than fact.”65 Another policy  report also admits that “even when good data is available, it is not always  used to inform decisions.”66 So no, Big Data on it’s own will not magi- cally fix decision-making deficiencies in humanitarian organizations, all  of which predate the era of Big Data; more information does not magically  equal more action or better decisions.  But why is it that many humanitarians ignore their own data when making  decisions during disasters? According to a recent and insightful study, “there  are a number of reasons for this, including data not being available in the  right format, not widely dispersed, not easily accessible by users, not being  transmitted through training and poor information management. Also, data  may arrive too late to be able to influence decision making in real-time oper- ations or may not be valued by actors who are more focused on immediate  action.”67 This is where digital humanitarians come in. The following chap- ters describe exactly how these networks use humanitarian technologies to  make sense of Big  Crisis  Data, thus providing humanitarian professionals  with the right data, in the right format, and at the right time.    3  Crowd Computing Social Media  It was already a record hot summer day in 2010 when my friend Gregory  Asmolov woke up to dubious news that the fires ravaging across Russia  had been contained. He didn’t buy it. As typically happens during such  disasters, Vladimir Putin was duly preoccupied with the important job of  covering up the true scale of the disaster. Meanwhile, hundreds in Moscow  were dying due to the resulting smog.1 The Kremlin’s response was particu- larly eἀective: neither the government nor the mass media provided any  real-time information to the public. “State-controlled television revealed as  little information as possible to the public about the fires and smog.”2 And  while the government claimed to have the situation under control, the vast  majority of towns that were in the line of fire never had a fighting chance.  In some cases, word of villages being engulfed by the flames would reach  the general public in Moscow weeks after the fact.3 Decades of corruption  meant that little to no investments had been made in disaster prepared- ness or response since the Cold War. Fire trucks were either missing or had  long fallen into disrepair, and the few paid firefighters that bravely fought  the dangerous flames did so with little to no equipment, prompting many  citizens to buy them masks, fire hoses, and other supplies.4  This may in part explain why only 4% of Russians polled during that  summer  said  that  they  trusted  government  media.5  Gregory  was  defi- nitely not one of those 4%, as he was relying on social media instead for  up-to-date  reports  on  the  fires.  Citizen  reports  posted  on  social  media  revealed both the immense scale of the disaster and the ongoing grass- roots response to the fires. Gregory realized that many Russians who were  hoping to get evacuated posted their needs online. And so, thousands of  Russian  bloggers  were  self-organizing  to  coordinate  relief  eἀorts  since  the Kremlin didn’t seem particularly bothered by the fires. Soon enough,  many bloggers mobilized to evacuate those in need, while other digital   49   50     Digital Humanitarians   volunteers  donated  resources  to  support  the  crowdsourced  firefighting  eἀorts. One of these Russian bloggers, for example, turned her apartment  into the main headquarters for the collection and distribution of humani- tarian  supplies.6  Other  bloggers  even  created  volunteer firefighter  units  equipped with professional firefighting equipment that had been donated  by Internet users. Meanwhile, Gregory was doing his best to match the  urgent needs posted online by those aἀected by the fires with the many  oἀers of help that Russian bloggers were also posting.  A PAIN IN THE SIDE OF PUTIN Like the digital humanitarian response to the Haiti earthquake, however,  Gregory and company quickly ran into the Big Data problem. As Gregory  later wrote, “While the Internet provided a platform for the 24-hour coor- dination and exchange of information on the emergency, it also created  a problem of information overload. A constant flow of requests for and  oἀers of help made efficient coordination more and more difficult.”7 So  he needed to find a better way to coordinate the allocation of resources  according to need so as to make their emergency relief operation more effi- cient and sustainable. This is when he remembered the story of volunteers  responding to the Haiti earthquake just months earlier  Chapter 1 . These  volunteers had used a crisis map to support the relief eἀorts on the ground.  So he pitched the idea of a crisis map to his friend Alexey Sidorenko. But  they were both concerned that using the Ushahidi platform would result  in total information overload just like the Haiti response. At this point,  however, our Russian friends had few other options. The Ushahidi plat- form would at least be an improvement over what they currently had. So  they launched their crowdsourced map in hopes to provide more targeted  and timely assistance to the victims of the wildfires  Figure 3.1 .  Unlike the Haiti Crisis Map, Gregory wanted the Russian fires map to  serve as a self-help map, a sort of “Match.com” for people-centered disaster  response by matching hyperlocal needs with community-based volunteer  resources and oἀers of help.  Match.com is a popular online dating site.   “The main purpose of the platform is not mapping wildfires, but primar- ily building the bridge between those citizens who need help and those  who wish to help,” he explained on his blog.8 To this end, anyone using  the digital map could add either “what is needed”  such as “need home,”    Crowd Computing Social Media     51  FIGURE 3.1 Screenshot of Russian Help Map.  From Gregory Asmolov.   “need clothes,” “need food,” “need evacuation,” etc.  directly to the help  map or information on “I want to help”  such as “I have clothes,” “I have  transport,” “I have food,” etc. . As Gregory recounts,  Visitors could choose a particular region on the map and receive all avail- able information about this region. If the user was interested in provid- ing help, he or she could see the closest location where help was needed.  The website could also show those with particular needs where the closest  source of potential help was located. A volunteer who wanted to send some  help to a region, but didn’t know how to do so, would be able to find a car  owner who was willing to drive to the area of disaster. A group of citizen  pilots oἀered their planes as a volunteer squadron to fight the wildfires.  In the absence of eἀective state intervention, the digital environment was  used to coordinate the provision of relief supplies and services.9  Together with other Russian volunteers, Gregory and Alexey did their  best to vet and verify the messages arriving in their Ushahidi inbox. They  would then try to create as many matches as possible based on the numer- ous oἀers of help they received and the growing number of needs posted to  the map. Gregory and team also set up an offline situation room in one of    52     Digital Humanitarians   the volunteers’ apartments in Moscow, where they ran a phone matching  service for elderly Russians who were not on the Internet. These elderly citi- zens often needed transportation, so they were matched with Russian vol- unteers who had oἀered to provide lifts in their towns or neighboring cities. In sum, our Russian friends were managing a more focused and well- defined set of information than we were during Haiti. In addition, they  had thousands of volunteers already mobilized in response to the massive  fires.  Many  of  these  volunteers  were  quite  adept  at  using  social  media  given  their  digital  activism  eἀorts  against  the  Kremlin.  This  large  vol- unteer base, together with the decision to focus exclusively on needs and  oἀers of help, enabled the team to better manage the Big Data deluge. That  said, Gregory and Alexey still had to spend an inordinate amount of time  coordinating hundreds of volunteers.  In any event, the response to this collective, mutual aid strategy was  overwhelming. More than 600 reports detailing specific needs or oἀers of  help were mapped during the first week alone. Over 100,000 unique users  visited the help map during this time period, resulting in more than a  quarter-million page views.10 As one Russian blogger observed, “Without  any  orders,  without  encouragement  and  not  craving  fame,  people  just  started to fulfill the functions of the state. . . . It turned out that a combina- tion of active people, the newest technologies of distributed work, the lack  of formal restrictions and unlimited source of knowledge on the Internet,  leads to a situation when this relatively small ‘virtual’ working group is  able to carry out operations that make a real impact on a huge territory.”11 Needless to say, this highly visible, crowdsourced response did not make  Putin look particularly good. Bloggers, not the Russian state, were the first  line of response. And so, a loose network of digitally savvy Russians ended  up  creating  a c rowdsourced  crisis  map  that  exposed  the  government’s  incompetence; the emperor was certainly not wearing any clothes, regard- less of what Putin wanted others to believe. As another Russian blogger  pointedly asked, “Why didn’t the Ministry of Emergencies come up with  such a project?”12 The volunteer-driven Help Map laid bare the fact that  Moscow was unable to take care of its own citizens. This became down- right embarrassing for the Kremlin.  Putin tried to counter the digital humanitarians by placing webcams  in some of the worst hit areas to prove that the government was on top of  things and responding appropriately. This attempt to come across as tech- savvy resulted in outright ridicule on Russian social media. After the fires  eventually burned out, Gregory and team were awarded the prestigious    Crowd Computing Social Media     53  FIGURE 3.2 Russian Help Map team wins “Internet Oscar.”  From Gregory Asmolov.   Russian “Internet Oscar” at the Runet Awards of 2010  see Figure 3.2 .  They were also invited to meet with the Russian president.13 Their help  map was a testament to the great potential of new technologies when used  to support community-based, self-organized mutual aid—particularly in  countries where the government is unwilling or incapable of reacting as  quickly  more on that in Chapter 9 .  HERE COME THE CROWDSOURCERERS The  remarkable  digital  humanitarian  response  to  the  Russian  fires  just  months  after  the  volunteer-driven  eἀorts  in  Haiti  made  me  realize  that  something profound was happening. This surge of digital goodwill was not  a one-oἀ  but quite possibly the start of something much bigger. The vol- unteers who had helped out in Haiti and Russia were now veteran digital  humanitarians, having served on the digital frontlines of Big Crisis Data.  What if we connected these digital good Samaritans and created a global  network of online humanitarians who are on standby and ready to respond  in the event of a major disaster? Why be reactive when we can be proactive?   54     Digital Humanitarians   Those were the questions I began to ask myself while the fires were sim- mering in Russia. And then a digital light bulb went oἀ  in my head. I  immediately reached out to a few friends, and together we launched the  Standby  Volunteer  Task  Force   SBTF   in  October  2010—just  9 m onths  after the Haiti earthquake.  If SBTF sounds boring, that’s because it is. We deliberately sought to  come up with a name that would sound as boring and nonthreatening as  possible. You see, this sudden surge in digital humanitarian response from  Haiti to Russia was unfortunately perceived as a nuisance to many in the  humanitarian community  not just to Putin . To be fair, we did have a big  mouth, but more to the point: no one had ever seen this kind of digital col- lective action in the humanitarian space before. And most people imag- ined a renegade group of volunteers wreaking havoc during relief eἀorts.  Most humanitarian organizations didn’t realize that half of these volun- teers were actually humanitarian professionals and experts in geographic  information systems  GIS . Keep in mind that most senior humanitarians  still didn’t understand what social media was, let alone understand the  role it could play in disaster response. This lack of understanding, coupled  with a bit of bravado on our end, is likely why one humanitarian organiza- tion started calling me the “crowdsourcerer.” While they meant this in a  derogatory way, I wore the title as a badge of honor, and still do!  In any event, I returned the compliment by referring to those conserva- tive humanitarians as “muggles,” a term from the Harry Potter series for  humans who aren’t capable of performing magic. This was rather imma- ture on my part, I’ll grant you. But it did lead to some rather comic conse- quences. I started getting emails from humanitarian professionals  most  of whom I didn’t know  assuring me that they weren’t muggles, that they  believed  in  the  potential  of  crowdsourcing.  One  newspaper,  which  had  picked up on the growing tensions between crowdsourcerers and mug- gles, even ran a story entitled “How Harry Potter Explains Humanitarian  Crowd-Sourcing.”14  And then, all of a sudden—as if by magic—the tensions between tra- ditional  and  digital  humanitarians  disappeared  on  a c risp  November  morning in New York City. My friends and I had just launched the SBTF,  and I’d been invited to speak on a panel at a conference. The other pan- elists included a rather senior official from the United Nations. Minutes  before we were set to go on stage, Oliver, the UN official, pulled me aside.  He wanted to talk. My first thought was: “Uh oh.” He walked me over  to a quiet corner and sat me down on a wooden bench. Oliver cleared    Crowd Computing Social Media     55  his throat and in his impeccable Queen’s English accent declared: “Right,  clearly you’re not going to go away. We wish you would, but you’re obvi- ously not. So we’ve decided to try a diἀerent strategy, one of constructive  engagement.” I was speechless for a while, then reached out my hand to  shake his. This changed everything.  A few weeks later, SBTF volunteers partnered with the UN on a disaster  response simulation in Colombia, which was very instructive. We learned  a lot from our UN partners during that exercise and began formalizing the  SBTF’s standard operating procedures as a result. We created individual  teams that would focus on single tasks. Our geo-location team, for exam- ple, was tasked with finding GPS coordinates for reports that needed to be  mapped. We also drafted a code of conduct and a list of activation crite- ria, for example. The latter was a set of guidelines to help us decide when  we, the SBTF network, should be activated. This document also served  to inform our humanitarian partners that we would only activate if they  could make a compelling case that they really needed our support and that  our activation would ultimately help disaster-aἀected communities.  In addition to the code of conduct, which was largely drawn from the  Red  Cross  Code  of  Conduct,  one  of  our  core  SBTF  principles  was  the  “prime directive”  to borrow the term from the Star Trek universe . The  SBTF’s prime directive prohibits us from communicating or interacting  with disaster-aἀected populations either online or offline. Why? Because  doing so comes with a lot of responsibility, as we had discovered in Haiti  earlier that year. We simply weren’t trained for this, and we recognized  that  communicating  with  populations  in  need  was  not  our  compara- tive advantage, but rather the mandate and responsibility of established  humanitarian organizations. Our humanitarian colleagues fully agreed  with this decision and still do.  We were just starting to get our act together as a volunteer network in  early 2011 when we received an urgent email from the UN in Geneva—more  specifically  from  the  UN  Office  for  the  Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Aἀairs  OCHA   pronounced Oh-Tcha .  THE ESCALATING CRISIS IN LIBYA Opposition protests in Tripoli began in the spring of 2011 during what  came to be known as the Arab Spring. In just a matter of days, the conflict    56     Digital Humanitarians   had escalated into violent clashes between government forces and rebels.  Weeks later, Libya was engulfed in full-scale civil war. Attacks, threats,  and  other  punitive  measures  and  antagonistic  rhetoric  by  the  regime  raised concerns about a serious humanitarian crisis. This was the context  in which several colleagues and I received that urgent email from the UN  in Geneva, which was quickly followed by a conference call.  Our UN colleagues from OCHA feared that the situation in Libya was  about to get a whole lot worse very quickly. But they had very little infor- mation  on  the  escalating  situation  and  humanitarian  impact  thus  far.  There were no UN personnel in the country at the time, and they obviously  couldn’t rely on state-controlled media. But the team in Geneva had wit- nessed the role that social media played in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia;  all those timely social media reports had kept the world informed. So our  UN partners asked if we could repeat our eἀorts from Haiti and create a  live crisis map of the escalating situation in Libya. They’d need us to draw  on  whatever  information  we  could  find  on  social  media.  The  date  was  February 28, 2011. The Standby Volunteer Task Force  SBTF  launched the  Libya Crisis Map the following day  Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.4 .  More  specifically,  OCHA  requested  that  the  SBTF  monitor  and  map  social  media  traffic  related  to  topics  such  as  people  movement,  health,  logistics,  and  security threat  issues.  SBTF  volunteers,  who  started  call- ing themselves “mapsters,” manually monitored Twitter, Facebook, Flickr,  and YouTube for relevant content. For security reasons, the SBTF did not  make the real-time crisis map public. So when Geneva requested that the  map be made public a couple days later, we categorically refused, citing  what we thought were rather obvious security concerns. After some back- and-forth on the subject, we oἀered a compromise. We could conceivably   FIGURE 3.3 Official UN tweet on the Libya Crisis Map.   Crowd Computing Social Media     57  FIGURE 3.4 Screenshot of the Libya Crisis Map.  create a highly redacted version of the map set on a 24-hour time delay and  make that version public while keeping the full, detailed map private for  UN personnel only. Our UN colleagues approved the idea, so we launched  the public map the following day. Within just 72 hours of the launch, the  public crisis map received over 18,000 unique visitors and close to 50,000  page views from 65 diἀerent countries.  Like the Haiti Crisis Map, the Libya map permitted users from the UN to  filter material by category, to zoom in on specific areas, and to view the set  of reports for each location. These reports could also be accessed and down- loaded directly. In addition, users could sign up to receive geographic alerts  based on regions of Libya that they were most concerned about. This made  the site a specialized news stream on the unfolding humanitarian crisis.  Over 300 mapsters on the SBTF media monitoring team and volunteers  from a group called Humanity Road contributed to the Libya deployment,  mapping  more  than  1,400  reports  over  the  course  of  just  a  few  weeks.  Together, they identified more than 100 relevant social media sources and    58     Digital Humanitarians   monitored these around the clock using a sign-up sheet online. A mapster,  for example, would add his or her availability, say 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.,  and mark the diἀerent sources  links  that she or he would be monitor- ing during this time. Any relevant social media  and mainstream news   reports they found during their shifts would be forwarded to the geo-loca- tion team. The latter would then try to find the GPS coordinates for the  location  town, city, etc.  referred to in said news reports. Like in Haiti and  Russia, the entire geo-referencing  or geo-tagging  process was carried out  manually. An initial hurdle was the creation of a comprehensive list for the  location of villages, towns, and cities across Libya, which the geo-location  team  tackled  by  using  dozens  of  mapping  resources,  including  Google  Maps, Bing Maps, OpenStreetMap, and Lonely Planet, as well as special- ized maps shared by humanitarian organizations and information shared  in the mainstream media.  The biggest challenge with respect to the geo-referencing task related to  many place names having diἀerent spellings. For example, Tobruk also  appears in maps as Tóbruch, Tobruch, Ţubruq, Tobruck, and Tubru. In  addition, some villages and towns share the exact same names. To address  these concerns, mapsters created a series of rules to disambiguate location  names, such as replacing i with ee and u with q. They also used Wikipedia  and  Google  Translate  to  identify  similar  phonetics  for  place  names  in  Arabic. Thanks to these resources and strategies, the geo-location team  was able to compile a long list of place names  with alternative spellings   and accurate GPS coordinates.  Several  days  later,  a s enior  UN  official  commended  Mapsters  for  their  dedication and professionalism, adding: “Your eἀorts at tackling a difficult  problem have definitely reduced the information overload; sorting through  the multitude of signals on the crisis is no easy task. The Task force has given  us an output that is manageable and digestible, which in turn contributes  to better situational awareness and decision-making.”15 OCHA was not the  only UN agency making use of the map. Josette Cheeran, the head of the  World Food Program  WFP  at the time, noted that the crisis map could  support her program’s relief operations  Figure 3.5 .  While the above reveals the immediate impact and added value of the  Libya  Crisis  Map,  perhaps  the  most  substantial  long-term  impact  was  organizational. The UN’s experience in collaborating with SBTF volun- teers  went  so  far  as  changing  some  of  OCHA’s  own  information  man- agement  workflows.  Indeed,  OCHA  not  only  adapted  the  technologies  used by the SBTF  like Skype and Google Docs , but it also borrowed the    Crowd Computing Social Media     59  FIGURE 3.5 Tweet by the former head of World Food Program. information  management  workflows  developed  by  digital  volunteers.16  Likewise, the SBTF learned a lot from OCHA in the process, gaining a  better understanding of what OCHA’s information needs were and what  kinds of trends analysis were most useful to them.  The Libya Crisis Map remains the SBTF’s longest crisis mapping deploy- ment.  We  maintained  operations  around  the  clock  for  four  consecutive  weeks. Keep in mind that this was an entirely volunteer-driven eἀort and that  the vast majority of volunteers also had full-time jobs or studies to attend to.  Most of us were completely burned out—myself included. By the end of the  deployment, our Skype chats—used to coordinate our operations—had pro- duced the equivalent of more than 4,000 pages of text in font size 10. That’s  more than 10 copies of this book combined, and then some. Thankfully, the  OCHA team in Colombia took over the operation with the help of UN vol- unteers, extending the deployment for another 4 weeks. Digital humanitar- ian volunteers had once again gone way above and beyond.  Just how above and beyond? I found out halfway through the deploy- ment that one digital volunteer, Justine Mackinnon, was a full-time air- side manager at London Heathrow International Airport where she was  in charge of real-time crisis management and incident control. After the  last aircraft had taken oἀ  around midnight, she would jump on Skype  to help out with the Libya Crisis Map. Another volunteer, Melissa Elliott,  would pick up her kids from their school across the city and every day,  while on the drive home, would pull the car over to map a few more urgent  tweets. At one point, one of our Egyptian volunteers appeared on Skype  and apologized profusely for having missed her earlier shift—she felt terri- ble for being behind on her geo-location tasks. We immediately reassured  her and told her not to worry, we were all doing our best. Only later did    60     Digital Humanitarians   we find out that she had been temporarily detained by the regime while  marching in Tahrir Square, which is why she had missed her shift.  I could go on and on with these real-life stories. These 300 volunteers  were  crisis  mapping  from  dozens  of  countries,  including,  but  not  lim- ited,  to  Australia,  Brazil,  Canada,  Colombia,  Czech  Republic,  Egypt,  France, Ghana, Haiti, Holland, Italy, Samoa, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka,  Switzerland, Tajikistan, UAE, UK, and the United States. Since SBTF vol- unteers occupied virtually every time zone, this gave us the unique ability  to crisis map Libya 24 7 without rest.  The result, like Haiti, was relative success mixed with exhaustion and  burnout. The SBTF was never designed to deploy for more than a few days.  Indeed, our comparative advantage is in rapid, short-term deployments.  Needless to say, we learned a lot about our limitations during this eἀort.  While some 300 volunteers had joined the eἀorts, we had still struggled to  keep up with the wealth of social media information being posted every  day. So recruiting more volunteers alone was simply not going to solve the  Big Data challenge. We also questioned whether the SBTF should engage  in humanitarian crises that are marred by violent conflict. We were by  no means data security experts, leaving us unable to guarantee that pri- vate crisis mapping data could not be hacked. Our experience in Libya  eventually led the SBTF to discourage deployments in conflict zones and  in countries under repressive rule. Two years after the Libya Crisis Map,  an article claimed that the map requested by OCHA had helped NATO  identity military targets during the crisis. A critical review of these claims,  however, suggests that the article was more sensationalist than based on  facts and logic.17  But we were slow in finding solutions to manage the Big Data challenge  following the Libya Crisis Map. We simply kept using the same methods  and technologies in subsequent deployments. And while we refined and  improved these each time, they became increasingly ineἀective against Big  Crisis Data. They also become more tedious and complicated for digital  volunteers to use. And so, while the SBTF network eventually grew to more  than 1,000 volunteers based in over 80 countries around the world, actual  engagement during deployments kept plummeting, with only a few dozen  volunteers showing up over and over—thus burning out in the process.  New volunteers found it too complicated and extremely laborious to under- stand just how to engage in crisis mapping eἀorts during deployments. It  became abundantly clear that the manual methods we had developed to    Crowd Computing Social Media     61  make sense of Big Crisis Data were not only ineἀective and exhausting to  implement, but also turning digital humanitarian volunteers away.  TIME FOR SMART CROWDSOURCING You return from a long, much deserved vacation completely oἀ the grid and  feel more refreshed than you have in years, rejuvenated even. And then you  discover more than 5,000 unread emails in your inbox. Most of these are  irrelevant, surely, but some are bound to require immediate replies. There’s  a very easy way to deal with this modern-day curse: simply declare “email  bankruptcy.” Delete all the emails that came in during your holiday and  simply email the folks who contacted you to explain the problem, invit- ing them to resend their emails if they still required a response. And next  time you’re about to head out on vacation, simply add the following note to  your automatic out-of-office message: “Thanks for your email! I’m oἀ-grid  until [add date]. This means that any emails that come in until then will be  automatically deleted. I simply do this for peace of mind while on vacation,  and not because I don’t value what you have to say. So, if your message is  important, then please kindly resend it when I’m back. Many thanks for  your kind understanding. I promise to return the favor. Let’s all help each  other find easier ways to disconnect in our hyperconnected world.” Voilà,  problem solved! You’re welcome.  Alas,  declaring  “Big  Data  bankruptcy”  is  not  an  option  for  digital  humanitarians. As the International Committee of the Red Cross  ICRC   noted over a decade ago, access to information during disasters is equally  important as access to food, water, shelter, and medication. In short, infor- mation has a very short shelf life since its “sell by” date is measured in  minutes and hours, not days.18 So if digital humanitarians can’t declare  Big Data bankruptcy, then what are they to do?  Keeping with the analogy of your email inbox and 5,000 unread emails,  you could invite a hundred friends to skim through 50 diἀerent emails at  the same time and simply tag the ones that they consider urgent. Assuming  that an email takes 10 seconds to skim, and each of your very nice 100  friends spends the next few minutes skimming through 50 emails each,  you’d have all 5,000 emails tagged in just 8 minutes. In contrast, if you’d  gone at it alone, skimming through all 5,000 emails would have taken you    62     Digital Humanitarians   over 800 minutes, or about 14 hours. Could digital humanitarians make  sense of Big Crisis Data by using a similarly distributed approach?  I often use the analogy of looking for needles in a haystack when describ- ing the challenge of Big Data for digital humanitarian response. So imag- ine that Big Data is a giant stack of information—one large enough to fill  an entire Olympic-sized stadium. Now, there are a few “needles” hidden  within this massive “haystack,” needles that represent very important— potentially life-saving—information for humanitarian organizations and  disaster-aἀected communities. How do you find this potentially life-sav- ing information as quickly as possible?  Well,  the  strategy  we  used  in  response  to  the  Haiti  earthquake  and  Libya  crisis  was  crowdsourcing—or  crowdsearching  rather.  We  invited  friends, colleagues, and strangers to search that gigantic haystack with  us and leave no piece of information unturned. This was not the most  efficient approach, to say the least. We couldn’t keep track of which sec- tions of the information stack had already been searched, for example.  Moreover, rummaging through this giant stack was very time-consum- ing and really tedious. This meant that we were rarely able to search more  than a small section during any given disaster. In short, we were mostly  grasping at straws.  So what would a more distributed approach look like? Perhaps we could  throw that giant haystack into a giant box, and then slice and dice that  huge box into 1,000 tiny boxes. We could then pair each volunteer from  the SBTF with a “mini box”—one per volunteer. Better yet, we could pair  three volunteers per mini box. That way we could be really thorough and  extra  sure  that  every  mini  box  had  been  thoroughly  inspected.  In  our  case, a mini box could contain 10 tweets posted during a disaster. Digital  volunteers would simply need to go through one box to look for relevant  tweets and be done. Given enough eyeballs and a smaller search area, all  “needles” could potentially be found much faster.  The technical term for this slice-and-dice solution is microtasking, which  I  often  refer  to  as  a  “smart  crowdsourcing”  or  just  crowd  computing.  A  microtasking platform takes a giant stack of information and slices it up  into far smaller stacks, which are then distributed to digital volunteers for  crowd computing purposes. Could this approach work on Big Crisis Data?  Could we slice and dice social media reports during disasters? Might we  even win our first battle against Big Data? We were about to find out in the  Philippines.   Crowd Computing Social Media     63  TYPHOON SEASON IN THE PHILIPPINES The  seeds  of  an  idea  that  would  take  the  field  of  digital  humanitarian  response to the next level were born a year before Typhoon Bopha struck  the Philippines in 2012. Winter had already arrived in Geneva when I met  my colleague Andrej Verity for a hot chocolate in November 2011. Andrej  is  from  the  UN  Office  for  the  Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Aἀairs   OCHA . He was our main point of contact at the UN when the SBTF  began collaborating directly with OCHA after Haiti. In fact, Andrej was  one of the very first UN professionals to recognize the power of digital  volunteers  and  crowdsourcing.  He  was  also  our  main  point  of  contact  throughout the Libya Crisis Map operation.  Andrej wanted to meet up to continue some conversations we had started  that summer in New York, conversations that revolved around the idea  of creating a humanitarian standby task force just for the UN. By sum- mer 2011, the Standby Volunteer Task Force  SBTF  and Humanitarian  OpenStreetMap were no longer the only game in town. Many other digi- tal volunteer groups, like GIS Corps and major companies like Esri, were  joining our eἀorts in supporting the UN’s crisis mapping needs. As Andrej  noted during our meeting in Geneva, an ecosystem of groups was starting  to emerge, and the next logical step was to connect these groups, thereby  creating a network of networks. This would encourage greater collabora- tion and facilitate joint deployments. This made perfect sense to me, so we  co-founded the Digital Humanitarian Network  DHN  just a few months  later.19 The DHN now serves as the official interface between established  humanitarian organizations and numerous digital volunteer networks. So  DHN members now provide the UN with the surge capacity they need to  make sense of Big Crisis Data during major disasters.  In December 2012, OCHA activated the DHN to carry out an ultra- rapid assessment of the extensive damage caused by Typhoon Bopha in the  Philippines  known locally as Typhoon Pablo . Our UN partners asked the  DHN to start collecting all tweets posted once the Typhoon made landfall.  More specifically, OCHA asked us to identify which of these tweets linked  to pictures or videos that captured infrastructure damage. Ideally, they  would then need us to geo-reference this multimedia for the purposes of  creating a crisis map that would be shared with other UN partners and the  Filipino government.   64     Digital Humanitarians   It typically takes OCHA and partners about 2 weeks to coordinate and  carry  out  their  joint  “rapid”  damage  assessments.  This  is  not  optimal,  which they know full well, hence their activating the DHN, whose mem- bers can use real-time information channels such as social media to create  an early “first draft” damage assessment. Shelter damage captured by eye- witnesses, for example, provides important information with respect to  the potential number of displaced, injured, and possibly trapped individu- als who require emergency housing and medical attention. Unlike the dig- ital humanitarian response to Haiti and Libya, however, the Philippines  deployment needed to be completed within 12 hours.  DHN  Coordinators  function  as  matchmakers.  They  take  activation  requests  from  the  UN  and  identify  the  appropriate  solution  teams— i.e., members  of  the  DHN—to  carry  out  these  requests.  In  the  case  of  Typhoon Pablo, DHN Coordinators invited the SBTF and Humanity Road  to spearhead the digital humanitarian response. The latter took responsibil- ity for sifting through the first half of the collected tweets, while the SBTF  focused on the second half of tweets.  The Philippines deployment was the first time that the SBTF partnered  with the Qatar Computing Research Institute  QCRI , a group that I had  joined just 6 months earlier as director of social innovation. My colleagues  at QCRI automatically filtered out tweets from our dataset that contained  no pictures or videos. This left us with more than 20,000 tweets. We had  less than 10 hours left to sift through these tweets and identify which ones  showed evidence of infrastructure damage. Once that was done, we would  still  need  to  find  out  where  in  the  Philippines  those  pictures  had  been  taken so that we could actually map the damage. And if this wasn’t already  challenging enough, only a dozen or so SBTF volunteers were available at  such short notice. This really felt like mission impossible. So we decided  to take a risk.  I  had  come  across  a b rand-new  initiative  a f ew  months  earlier  called  CrowdCrafting.20 The group had declared that it would create a free and  open-source microtasking platform for anyone to use. So with 9 hours left  on the clock, I looked up the website and found a contact email for a person  called Daniel Lombraña González. I quickly emailed him and explained  the urgency of the situation. Incredibly, Daniel replied within the hour and  kindly oἀered to help, but stressed that the platform was still very much  under development. No matter, we might at least give this a try. I emailed  Daniel the tweets with links. He promptly uploaded them to the micro- tasking interface shown in Figure 3.6, which he customized for our digital    Crowd Computing Social Media     65  FIGURE 3.6 Screenshot of microtasking interface during Typhoon Pablo. humanitarian eἀorts. We only had a few hours left at this point, so we shared  the link publicly via social media in the hopes of recruiting more volunteers. As the screenshot in Figure 3.6 shows, tweets with links were displayed  using CrowdCrafting’s microtasking interface. If a link pointed to an image  or video that captured damage, digital volunteers would check oἀ the appro- priate box. If the text of the tweet or the picture video itself provided geo- graphical clues to identify where exactly in the Philippines the image video  had been taken, the volunteer would check oἀ the location box accordingly.  This would then open up a map prompting volunteers to either point the  cursor to the location in question or search for said location by typing in  the name of the location using the search box. Just under 100 images videos  from the Philippines were microtasked and geo-referenced in this way.  An important feature of many microtasking platforms is the built-in tri- angulation mechanism they provide. For example, one can have each tweet  tagged by at least five independent volunteers. If there is complete consensus,  i.e., if each of the five volunteers tags the tweet as pointing to a picture of  damage, then one can trust that the picture is accurately tagged. The same    66     Digital Humanitarians   FIGURE 3.7 Screenshot of the official UN Crisis Map for Typhoon Pablo.  From OCHA.  triangulation technique can be applied to geo-tagging. Only if five volun- teers geo-tag an image within the same area  ± a specified threshold  can  one trust that the geo-coordinates are accurate. This vote-based approach to  triangulation enables a crowd of volunteers to produce high-quality data in a  very short period of time, which explains how the DHN was able to complete  the Philippines deployment in less than 12 hours, providing the UN with a  database of relevant geo-tagged multimedia content. OCHA used these data  to create the Philippines Crisis Map  Figure 3.7 . While far from perfect, this  crisis map was nevertheless unique at the time because it was the first to be  drawn entirely from multimedia content shared on Twitter and geo-tagged  by volunteers from all around the world using a microtasking platform.  MICROMAPPERS VS. TYPHOON YOLANDA While the digital humanitarian response to Typhoon Pablo was a struggle  and entirely reactive, the experience was further proof that the shift from  crowdsourcing to microtasking had to be made if we were going to win    Crowd Computing Social Media     67  any future battles against Big Crisis Data. I was pondering this thought in  early 2013 when I received an opportune call from OCHA in New York.  They had an important question: “Are you ready to repeat the use of micro- tasking for future deployments?” My answer: “Absolutely not.” Fact is, our  response to Typhoon Pablo had been a mess and we had barely scram- bled in time to deliver. If Daniel at CrowdCrafting hadn’t been around to  quickly customize the microtasking interface we used, then there’d have  been no deployment. Moreover, it had taken Daniel some time to custom- ize that interface, and it still needed to be improved. Plus, it had become  evident that we needed to have more than one microtasking interface—we  needed one interface for tagging tweets, one for images, one for videos,  and  one  for  geo-tagging.  Combining  all  these  into  one  interface  made  volunteering too complicated, which was the feedback we received from  SBTF mapsters who had joined the deployment.  So no, we were in no position to repeat this deployment any time soon.  But I oἀered to launch a new project to create a fully customized micro- tasking platform for humanitarian response—a platform that would be on  standby and available within minutes of the DHN being activated. OCHA  was both game and a willing partner. Thus was born MicroMappers, just  months  before  one  of  the  most  powerful  typhoons  in  recorded  human  history tore through the Philippines.21 Some 2 million Filipinos were left  homeless and more than 6 million were displaced after Typhoon Yolanda.  Over 6,000 people lost their lives, and some 20,000 were still missing a  year later. In the city of Tacloban, some 90% of the structures were either  damaged or completely destroyed.  OCHA activated the DHN just hours before the Typhoon made landfall  on November 8, 2013. The request was similar to the one we had received  the previous year in response to Typhoon Pablo. OCHA asked us to carry  out a very rapid disaster damage and needs assessment. More specifically,  the DHN was asked to collect all the tweets related to the typhoon over a  72-hour period, find out which of these included links to pictures, deter- mine the level of damage in each picture, and then geo-reference those that  showed the most damage. In addition, the DHN was tasked with identifying  which tweets referred to urgent needs and population displacement. Over  a quarter-million tweets were eventually posted during the first 72 hours.  DHN coordinators invited the SBTF to carry out the mission. On our  end, we were still developing the MicroMappers platform, which was defi- nitely not ready for prime time. At most, 30% of the platform had been  developed.  We  made  this  crystal  clear  to  our  UN  colleagues,  but  the    68     Digital Humanitarians   overall consensus was that trying to win the battle with Big Data was bet- ter than not trying at all. And so we deployed the platform, literally work- ing around the clock for days on end to make sure we were able to deliver. MicroMappers  is  simply  a c ollection  of  customized  microtasking  apps,  which we call clickers. The Image Clicker, for example, allows digital human- itarians to quickly tag pictures based on the severity of damage shown in  the pictures  Figure 3.8 . We automatically collected pictures from Twitter  during the digital response to Yolanda and then uploaded them to the Image  Clicker for tagging. Each image was shown to at least five diἀerent volun- teers for quality assurance purposes. Altogether, some 5,000 images were  uploaded to the clicker, but we only managed to tag 1,200, and only 200 of  these were geo-referenced and mapped. What about the other 3,800 pictures,  you might ask? Well, the University of Geneva’s server, which we were using  to run the MicroMappers platform, crashed repeatedly, and for many hours  on end, due to the strain of hundreds of volunteers tagging at the same time. This meant that MicroMappers was down for at least 12 hours during  the 72-hour deployment. As for the other 60 hours, the platform almost  ground to a halt because of the traffic. At times it would take the Image  Clicker more than 5 minutes to load and display a new picture. As a result,  many digital volunteers simply gave up, and I certainly don’t blame them;  it was very frustrating for all of us. The good news is that we then pur- chased our own, far more powerful server, which is exclusively dedicated   FIGURE 3.8 Screenshot of MicroMappers Image clicker.   Crowd Computing Social Media     69  to MicroMappers. This new server should be able to handle tens of thou- sands of digital volunteers simultaneously.  In any event, while we ended up with many images tagged as severe, most  were never geo-referenced and added to the crisis map. Why? Because our  Image Geo Clicker had not been developed yet. So we could not quickly  microtask the geo-tagging of images. We were forced to resort to good old  crowdsourcing instead to geo-reference the backlog of images; needless to  say, we lost the Big Data geo-battle. The good news is that our Image Geo  Clicker is now up and fully operational. As such, once an image is voted  on three times using the Image Clicker and there is full consensus among  the three votes that the image shows “mild” or “severe” damage, the image  gets automatically pushed to the Image Geo Clicker along with the origi- nal tweet that pointed to said image.  Over at the Image Geo Clicker, digital humanitarian volunteers see the  text of the original tweet along with the picture that the tweet linked to.  In addition, the Image Geo Clicker includes a map that volunteers use to  pinpoint where in the Philippines the displayed picture might have been  taken. Occasionally, the text of the tweet will reveal some geographical  clues. Other times, the picture itself will show some recognizable land- mark—hence  the  importance  of  inviting  local  digital  humanitarians  to  support  these  eἀorts—they  have  the  local  knowledge  that  non-Filipino  volunteers simply do not have. Each picture is geo-tagged by three diἀer- ent volunteers before it ends up on the live crisis map shown in Figure 3.9.  According to our humanitarian colleagues in the Philippines, both the  UN and the Filipino government used this map to rapidly assess the extent  of the damage following Typhoon Yolanda.  In addition to tagging images, our UN partners had asked the DHN  to identify tweets that referred to urgent needs and population displace- ment, for example. For this, we used the Tweet Clicker  Figure 3.10 . Like  the Image Clicker, the Tweet Clicker is very easy to use. Digital volunteers  simply tagged or categorized tweets based on the information they con- tained. Before uploading to the Tweet Clicker the 250,000+ tweets we had  collected, however, we filtered out retweets and ran an automated algo- rithm to identify unique tweets. This reduced our haystack to about 55,000  tweets. Somehow, despite repeated server issues and interruptions, digital  humanitarians were still able to tag just over 30,000 of those tweets within  72 hours. Of these tweets, 3,800 were identified as relevant and about 600  were added to a live crisis map. In other words, just 0.3% of the tweets    70     Digital Humanitarians   FIGURE 3.9 Screenshot of the Crisis Map of Typhoon Yolanda depicting disaster damage.  From ESRI  GIS Corps.   FIGURE 3.10 Screenshot of MicroMappers Tweet Clicker.   Crowd Computing Social Media     71  collected  600 out of 250,000+ tweets  were deemed informative. Digital  humanitarian response really is like looking for needles in a haystack.  Like the Image Clicker, each tweet was voted on by at least five diἀer- ent volunteers. In total, this means that some 275,000 votes were cast to  categorize those 30,000 tweets. Combine this with the ~25,000 votes cast  for the images and you have a total of 300,000 clicks on MicroMappers  in just 72 hours. That’s well over 4,000 clicks per hour. And assuming it  takes about 3 seconds for someone to tag an image or tweet, the 300,000  clicks  represents  250  hours  of  human  volunteer  time,  or  over  10  days  compressed in under 72 hours. Such is the power of digital humanitar- ians when they have access to simple and rewarding humanitarian tech- nology. Incidentally, volunteers had the option of signing up to keep track  of their clicks, which would be converted to points; the higher the num- ber, the higher the rank they would get—which went all the way to the  rank of “Secretary General of the United Nations.” This feature proved  especially popular.  MicroMappers  represents  an  important  shift  in  the  digital  humani- tarian space. We’ve now made it as easy as a single click of the mouse  to  accelerate  humanitarian  aid.  If  you’re  reading  this  and  know  how  to use a computer mouse, then you too can be a d igital humanitarian.  MicroMappers democratizes digital humanitarian eἀorts. We even have a  smartphone app now, so you can volunteer while on the go. Want to join  and make a diἀerence during the next disaster? Simply add yourself to the  MicroMappers e-mail list at MicroMappers.org—no previous experience  or super powers required—nor blood or money donations.    4  Crowd Computing Satellite  and Aerial Imagery  The plane vanished, seemingly out of thin air, shortly after midnight on  March 8, 2014. Malaysia Airlines flight 370 had just taken oἀ from Kuala  Lumpur International Airport and was cruising into the night bound for  the Chinese capital of Beijing. The Boeing 777 aircraft was carrying 227  passengers and 12 crew members. The sudden disappearance of the airliner  triggered the largest search and rescue eἀort in history. A multinational  air-sea search involving more than 100 ships, planes, and helicopters from  at least 14 countries was launched.1 My colleague Luke Barrington was  following the news from Colorado. And when several more days went by  with no sign of Flight 370, he decided to take the search and rescue eἀorts  online. Luke and his team at Tomnod launched what would become the  largest digital search and rescue eἀorts ever.2  CROWDSEARCHING FLIGHT 370 Tomnod is a microtasking platform. Unlike MicroMappers, however, the  Tomnod platform focuses exclusively on microtasking satellite imagery.  After  DigitalGlobe   DG ,  the  largest  satellite  imagery  company  in  the  world, acquired Tomnod, Luke and team gained direct access to DG’s sat- ellites. As Luke likes to say, “I now get to fly five satellites in space, which is  pretty sweet.”3 When he realized that traditional search and rescue eἀorts  for Flight 370 were going nowhere, he decided to deploy the Tomnod plat- form overnight. He and his team got DG’s latest high-resolution satellite  images  for  the  areas  that  were  being  searched.  They  quickly  uploaded   73   74     Digital Humanitarians   these to the Tomnod platform, which sliced and diced the imagery into  millions of very small micro-images. Each one of these micro-images was  then analyzed for any sign of floating debris, oil slicks, life rafts, etc., by a  vast number of digital volunteers from all around the world.  I went to the Tomnod website and joined the eἀorts. The microtasking  platform beamed me down to the ocean’s surface where I i mmediately  saw  waves  and  whitecaps  scattered  across  the  high-resolution  satellite  image. I reviewed a few dozen micro-images but had nothing to report.  The massive response to Tomnod’s call to action was truly spectacular.  Within days of the launch, more than 8 million volunteers—equivalent to  the entire population of Austria—had joined the crowdsearching eἀorts to  locate the missing airliner. In just 4 days, these digital volunteers tagged  some 15 million features of interest in three-quarters of a billion satellite  images, which together covered close to 1 m illion square kilometers of  land and ocean  about 400,000 square miles .  The  Tomnod  team  was  completely  unprepared  for  this  massive  digi- tal flood of goodwill. In fact, no one had seen anything quite like it. At  one point, a half-million people were simultaneously trying to tag images  on the microtasking platform. So Tomnod’s servers crashed repeatedly,  which frustrated several hundred thousand volunteers in the process. But  Luke and team scrambled and eventually secured more servers to keep the  crowdsearching eἀorts afloat. Close to 1 million digital volunteers have  since joined Tomnod’s listserv, which means they can be alerted about  future crowdsearching eἀorts within seconds.  So how did the folks at Tomnod make sense of the resulting 15 mil- lion tags? This was yet another Big Data challenge; they couldn’t possibly  go through each one at a time, which explains why Luke and company  used their CrowdRank algorithm to automatically identify which of the  15 million tagged features were worth sharing with imagery experts at  DigitalGlobe  DG  for further analysis. These experts would then com- municate  the  most  promising  leads  to  the  American,  Australian,  and  Malaysian search and rescue teams on the ground. CrowdRank simply  identifies tagged features that have the highest levels of crowd consensus.4  If at least 90% of digital volunteers tagged a feature in a micro-image as  showing evidence of plane wreckage, for example, then Tomnod would  pass that image on to DG’s imagery experts for further investigation. In  one such case, for example, what had been mistakenly taken for scattered  debris on the ocean’s surface by most volunteers was actually a trail of  waves left behind by a fast-moving ship.   Crowd Computing Satellite and Aerial Imagery     75  CrowdRank also enables the Tomnod team to identify which volunteers  are consistently the most accurate taggers in the crowd, along with the  most inaccurate volunteers. This enables them to congratulate their most  active and meticulous volunteers. In the future, Luke and team are plan- ning to invite their top 1% best performing volunteers to review features  that  the  CrowdRank  algorithm  identifies  as  having  the  highest  crowd  consensus. “We’re thinking of crowdsourcing the crowdsourcing,” Luke  explained.5 These top performers could simply review the 100 most prom- ising features identified using CrowdRank and quickly determine which  of these should be reviewed by professional imagery analysts.  Like our MicroMappers deployment, Luke and team were also looking  for a needle in a giant, growing stack of information. As one pilot involved  in the search and rescue eἀorts noted early on, “This is not just a needle  in a haystack, it’s a haystack that gets bigger and shifts under us due to  the [ocean] drifts.”6 While the crowdsearching campaign has not found  any conclusive traces of the missing airliner, neither have the 100 ships,  planes, and helicopters deployed to the scene. And while the price tag for  Tomnod was a grand total of $80,000 to purchase the new servers needed  to keep its platform from crashing, it cost Australia alone $550,000 a day  just to operate one of its military ships as part of the multinational search  and rescue operation.7 Meanwhile, the United States and Japan spent over  $15 million between them to support the eἀorts.  Perhaps the biggest added value of this digital search was in identifying  where  the  aircraft  was  most  definitely  not  located—that  is,  approaching  this crowdsearching operation as a process of elimination. In other words,  the large digital crowd can provide the first-level filter so that DG’s small  team of expert analysts don’t have to spend their time looking at thousands  of images of barren oceans. Basically, if the mandate is to leave no stone  unturned, then the crowd can do that very well. In sum, microtasking can  reduce the signal-to-noise ratio so that experts can focus more narrowly  on analyzing the potential signals. This process may not be perfect just  yet, but it can certainly be refined and improved. Besides, professionals  also get it wrong—like Chinese analysts did when they claimed that one  of their satellites had found the supposed Malaysian airliner.8  This was not the first time that satellite imagery and microtasking were  used to find a missing plane. On Monday, September 3, 2007, American  businessman Steve Fossett went missing. A record-setting aviator, Steve was  the first person to fly solo nonstop around the world in a balloon. He had  taken oἀ that Monday morning in a single-engine airplane from a private    76     Digital Humanitarians   airstrip in Nevada. Steve was never to be heard from again. Search and  rescue eἀorts were launched that afternoon with several Civil Air Patrol  aircraft eventually searching more than 20,000 square miles of desert. A  few days after his disappearance, DigitalGlobe released a series of high- resolution satellite imagery of the area and made it available on Amazon’s  microtasking  platform  called  Amazon  Mechanical  Turk.  Some  50,000  digital  volunteers  joined  the  digital  crowdsearch  eἀorts,  analyzing  over  300,000 micro-satellite images for signs of Steve. Alas, none were found  until a year later when a hiker came across Steve’s wallet. A few days later,  search teams found the wreckage. To date, however, no one has reviewed  the satellite images to determine whether evidence was overlooked.  GENGHIS KHAN IN SOMALIA In 2010, 4 years before the Malaysian airliner went missing, I began ask- ing myself the following question: Could microtasking the analysis of  satellite  imagery  also  be  used  to  support  international  humanitarian  eἀorts? After all, the UN has had an Operational Satellite Applications  Program   UNOSAT   for  decades.  And  satellite  imagery—like  social  media—is  a ma jor  Big  Data  headache.  In  2011,  the  satellite  imagery  company DigitalGlobe  DG  alone was imaging around 700,000 square  miles daily  2 million square kilometers  at a resolution of 50 centime- ters. “This is a Big Data problem that needs mass human intervention  until  the  software  can  catch  up,”  my  colleague  Pierre  Izard  from  DG  noted in an email to me at the time. This sounded like the perfect storm  for a microtasking solution.  So  I d id  some  research  on  microtasking  platforms  for  satellite  imag- ery and in the process came across a curious 800-year-old mystery. On  August 18, 1227, Genghis Khan vanished. No one really knows how he  died. According to legend, Khan was laid to rest in an unmarked tomb  along  with  his  immense  treasures.  Some  even  say  a r iver  was  diverted  to flow over his grave so it would never be found. And so, for hundreds  of  years,  historians  and  treasure  hunters  have  sought  to  find  the  tomb  of Khan. This is how I met my colleague Albert Lin, a research scientist  at the University of California in San Diego. Albert belongs to the next  generation of archeologists—a digital Indian Jones of sorts. In his inno- vative Valley of the Khans project, which he spearheaded with National    Crowd Computing Satellite and Aerial Imagery     77  Geographic and GeoEye, Albert used a microtasking platform to crowd- search the location of Genghis Khan’s tomb. Here was his call to action:  Hello fellow explorers!  The entire Valley of the Khans team is very excited to begin the expedi- tion to Mongolia but, for me, the adventure begins today. By enlisting the  help of thousands of “virtual explorers” like you, we can start to uncover  the mysteries of the Valley of the Khans right now!  The area that we will be exploring has been untouched for more than 800  years. There are no maps, no roadsigns, and no one to ask for directions. But  we’ve scanned the landscape with super high-resolution satellite imagery. By  participating in the online exploration on this site, YOU can join our team  by examining these satellite images and searching for clues that will guide  our quest to discover the lost tomb of Genghis Khan. Maybe you’ll map out  roads and rivers that our expedition can follow to make our way through this  inhospitable territory. Perhaps you can identify traces of a nomad’s ger that  might be a good place for us to camp. Or maybe you’ll see the buried outline  of an ancient tomb that could be the clue we’re searching for.9  When  I c ame  across  this  search  for  Khan,  more  than  10,000  digital  archeologists had already joined the campaign  Figure 4.1 . Together, they  had sifted through 600,000+ micro-satellite images. Meanwhile, Albert   FIGURE 4.1 Screenshot of Valley of the Khans Project.  From National Geographic.    78     Digital Humanitarians   and team were on site in Mongolia. And every time volunteers found very  promising clues online, the away team would jump into their jeep and  head to the location in question for further investigation. While Khan’s  tomb remains a mystery to this day, the project provided the answer to  my question: We could definitely use the same approach and perhaps even  the same platform to support international relief eἀorts. So I got in touch  with Albert and company to learn more. It turns out that the Valley of the  Khans project was the very first time the Tomnod platform was used.  Almost 800 years after Genghis Khan vanished, I received an email from  my colleague Edouard Legoupil at UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. He  had read my blog post on the search for Genghis Khan and wanted to know  whether I was really serious about, “You know, applying this microtasking  thing to analyze satellite imagery during humanitarian crises.” I was 100%  serious. “All right then, want to try out your idea in Somalia?”  The UN had just declared that the country was facing a major famine.  The humanitarian crisis was escalating, the result of two pernicious fac- tors: the extensive drought that had been drying up large areas of the Horn  of Africa for months, and the violent attacks committed by an Al-Qaeda- backed group called al-Shabaab. These dangerous extremists were attack- ing humanitarian aid workers and Somalis alike in and out of the capital   Mogadishu. This meant that the UN had to limit its presence in-country  and could not deliver food and water to those in need.  As the fighting in the capital escalated, countless numbers of Somalis  were displaced to the west of the country, a semiarid desert area called the  Afgooye Corridor. According to Edouard, UNHCR needed to identify the  total number of displaced populations in order to start mobilizing food  aid. While it could not deliver this aid right now, chances were that the  UN would be able to negotiate access in coming weeks. But how many  Somalis had actually been displaced? How much food aid was necessary?  There were one or two guesstimates, but no one was quite sure. So the UN  Refugee Agency wanted another way to count the number of displaced  Somalis who were setting up camp in the Afgooye Corridor.  This is why Edouard had emailed me. Could the search for Genghis Khan  also support the UN’s eἀorts in the Horn of Africa? Could we use high- resolution satellite imagery of the corridor to count the number of infor- mal and temporary shelters that displaced Somalis were living in? And if  so, could we microtask the analysis of this imagery in order to accelerate  the eἀorts? Speed was of the essence; as Edouard had mentioned, it would  take the agency more than 2 months to carry out the analysis on its own    Crowd Computing Satellite and Aerial Imagery     79  since it only had two analysts on hand. I called Albert and told him what  I had in mind. He was game and connected me to his Tomnod colleague  Luke to get the ball rolling. I then called Pierre over at DigitalGlobe to  ask whether he’d be willing to donate expensive high-resolution satellite  imagery. Without the imagery, there would of course be no project. While  Pierre had never heard of Tomnod before, he was intrigued and agreed to  try this out. We launched the project shortly after that call.  Someone once said that having a map with up-to-date satellite imagery  is like having your own helicopter.10 That’s exactly how I feel when flying  around  in  Google  Earth.  And  now  that  we  had  high-resolution  satellite  imagery for Somalia sliced up and served on the Tomnod platform, we were  ready to go. It was time to fly, but the UN was in dire need of pilots. So I  turned to my friends at the Standby Volunteer Task Force  SBTF , a global  network of digital humanitarian volunteers  Chapter 3 . They were excited to  participate in this project, and the fact that one of our volunteers—Shadrock  Roberts—was an expert in satellite imagery analysis made all the diἀerence.  Shadrock quickly drafted a user-friendly how-to manual to help volunteers  identify temporary shelters in Somalia’s Afgooye Corridor.  The  result  of  this  unique  and  novel  project  was  impressive.  Within  120  hours,  SBTF  volunteers  identified  over  a q uarter-million  possible  shelters  in  close  to  4,000  micro-satellite  images.  In  other  words,  digi- tal volunteers tagged more than 2,000 possible shelters per hour for 120  hours straight. Like the MicroMappers platform, each image was shown  to a ha ndful of volunteers for quality assurance purposes. At the time,  Tomnod  had  just  developed  CrowdRank,  a s et  of  statistical  techniques  that could provide more insights on the quality of the microtasking car- ried out by digital volunteers. This enabled us to identify and reward vol- unteers who were the most active and accurate in identifying temporary  shelters, for example. The CrowdRank algorithm also helped us identify  just how many unique shelters had been found. The result? Digital volun- teers identified just over 44,000 shelters.  Our UN partners used this number to estimate the total population in the  Afgooye Corridor since they knew approximately how many people tended  to live in these types of informal shelters. The overall figure of displaced  peoples was not made public given political sensitivities, but the number did  provide the UN Refugee Agency with an independently acquired estimate,  which it could compare and triangulate with its other figures.  So this is the story about how the search for Genghis Khan helped the  UN find displaced Somalis in the Horn of Africa. Months later, while in    80     Digital Humanitarians   Geneva, my SBTF colleagues and I met with the UN High Commissioner  for Refugees  the head of UNHCR , who congratulated us on our novel  eἀorts. He even let me record a video of him in which he directly addresses  and thanks SBTF volunteers for their support.11 Perhaps in the near future,  we’ll see real-time collaboration between UN food convoys on the ground  and digital volunteers microtasking satellite imagery online.  FROM ASTROPHYSICS TO ZOOMANITARIANS Kevin Schawinski had a problem, a big one. If his newly formed theory  proved correct, it would run directly against conventional wisdom in the  field of astrophysics. Could the young researcher be right? Would his career  at Oxford University be over if he turned out to be wrong? It was considered  a truism in astrophysics that stars could not be formed in more ancient  10  billion-year-old  elliptical galaxies as well as in younger spiral galaxies.12 To  disprove this accepted “fact,” however, Kevin was faced with the daunting  task of manually analyzing a million galaxies to determine whether they  were elliptical or spiral galaxies. Since no computer could automatically  classify these stellar images for him with any reasonable level of accuracy,  he simply had no other choice: he’d have to tag the million images by hand.  So he took a deep breath and dove in, working 12-hour days nonstop for an  entire week. The result? He needed a drink  or three .  While Kevin had tagged a remarkable 50,000 galaxies in just a week,  this represented only 5% of the giant “haystack” of galaxies he needed to  sift through. “At this rate, I’ll be tagging galaxies for the next 2 years,” he  moaned to his friend Chris Lintott at a local pub on a Friday night in July  2007. The two sat in the backroom of that pub for a long time, brainstorm- ing. And then it clicked. What if they recruited volunteers to help tag the  images online? By the time the bar closed, they had a plan—they’d upload  the galaxy pictures to a website and challenge astronomy geeks to tag as  many galaxies as possible. Two days later, the Galaxy Zoo website went  live. The response was totally unexpected. Within 24 hours of the launch,  volunteers were tagging tens of thousands of galaxies per hour. All 1 mil- lion images were tagged within just a few weeks.  In fact, each image was tagged by 10 diἀerent digital volunteers—mean- ing that a total of 10 million tags had been created in less than 3 weeks.  Chris and Kevin were completely taken aback—not only by the incredible    Crowd Computing Satellite and Aerial Imagery     81  response, but also by the quality of the tagging, which was extremely accu- rate. Later, they had each and every galaxy tagged by 30 diἀerent volun- teers, resulting in a total of some 35 million clicks by more than 80,000  volunteers.  The  new  and  unique  data  created  by  these  clicks  resulted  in  numerous  scientific  discoveries  that  were  published  in  many  peer- reviewed journals in the years that followed.  Thus was born the world of Zooniverse, a c ollection of microtasking  projects that promote education while democratizing scientific explora- tion. The Zooniverse team is currently running just over a dozen proj- ects, with several more in the works. One recent deployment, called Planet  Four  a reference to the red planet Mars , received some 15,000 visitors  within  the  first  60  seconds  of  being  announced  on  BBC  Television.  So  guess how many weeks it took for volunteers to tag over 2 millon satellite  images of Mars? A total of 0.286 weeks, i.e., 48 hours!13 Bonus: The micro- tasking platform never crashed. The Zooniverse listserv now boasts well  over  1 m illion  digital  volunteers.  Incidentally,  Zooniverse  deployments  also involve tagging earth-based pictures  in contrast to telescope imag- ery . Take the Serengeti Snapshot deployment, which invited volunteers  to classify wild animals photographed by 225 motion sensor cameras in  Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park.14 Volunteers swarmed this project in  no time and complained when there were no more pictures to tag.  “I have a ‘techie crush’ on Zooniverse,” I confessed to Brooke Simmons  when I got in touch with the team in 2012. Thankfully, the feeling was  mutual,  and  so  began  our  Zoomanitarian  adventure  together.  All  we  needed  now  was  rapid  access  to  satellite  imagery  during  disasters.  The  plan was to slice and dice this imagery and upload it to Zooniverse for vol- unteers to tag images based on severity of damage—much like the Image  Clicker  on  MicroMappers.  Getting  access  to  satellite  imagery  proved  a  challenge, however. So the project lay dormant for a couple years while I  waited for a stealthy start-up with the cryptic name of Cosmogia to dis- rupt the commercial satellite industry.  Cosmogia didn’t even have a website when I secured a formal partner- ship  with  the  group  in  2012.  The  start-up—now  called  Planet  Labs—is  spearheaded by senior NASA scientists who seized on the opportunity to  radically democratize access to satellite imagery. In February 2014, Planet  Labs deployed a remarkable constellation of 28 low-orbit micro-satellites,  which provides the company with 24 7 coverage of the entire planet. In  contrast, all other satellites can only take a picture of the same place on  Earth once every 24 hours at best—which is a very long time in disaster    82     Digital Humanitarians   response. Moreover, traditional satellite companies only image 5% of the  planet in high resolution on a daily basis.15 There is a trade-oἀ, of course.  Planet Labs satellites do not provide the same level of high-resolution imag- ery as do traditional satellites. The latter can snap pictures at a resolution of  50 centimeters compared to Planet Lab’s 3- to 5-meter resolution. But the  3- to 5-meter resolution is still good enough to detect major infrastructure  damage following a d isaster. Moreover, Planet Labs will be recycling its  satellites with new higher-resolution onboard cameras in the near future.  So  I i nvited  my  colleague  Alex  Bakir  from  Planet  Labs  to  join  the  Zoomanitarian team, which he happily accepted. We’re now creating the  plumbing to rapidly transfer satellite imagery from Planet Labs directly  to Zooniverse in Oxford for microtasking analysis by their million vol- unteers. In the meantime, I’m exploring partnership opportunities with  humanitarian  organizations  to  make  the  results  of  this  project  readily  available to them when the next disaster strikes. These are still early days  and this project remains highly experimental, but I’m excited. Zooniverse  volunteers were able to tag some 2 million images of Mars in just 48 hours.  Imagine how close to real time we’ll be able to carry out disaster dam- age assessments on Earth in the near future thanks to Planet Labs and  Zooniverse. By the time you read this book, we’ll have carried out at least  one  pilot  deployment  and  potentially  an  actual  response  to  a d isaster.  We’re calling this new initiative The Planetary Response Network. You  can find out at Digital-Humanitarians.com.  UAVs AS HUMANITARIAN TECHNOLOGIES At the request of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian  Aἀairs   OCHA ,  I j oined  the  Information  Management  Team  in  the  Philippines shortly after Typhoon Yolanda in November 2013. I was to  observe  the  team  in  action  and  make  recommendations  on  how  their  eἀorts  could  be  improved  using  new  technologies  and  advanced  com- puting. This deployment remains one of the most insightful experiences  I’ve had in recent years, and it was there that I came across not one or  two but several small civilian UAV  or drone  projects.16 UAV stands for  unmanned aerial vehicle; you’ll also find these described as Unmanned  Aerial Systems  UAS  and even Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems  RPAS .  And you thought UN acronyms were bad? In any event, the number of    Crowd Computing Satellite and Aerial Imagery     83  civilian UAV projects I came across while in the Philippines was abso- lutely unprecedented in the field of disaster response.  UAVs  are  typically  classified  into  two  categories—fixed-wing  and  rotary-wing  UAVs.  Fixed-wing  UAVs  are  like  miniature  airplanes,  but  what distinguishes them from remote control planes is that they are intel- ligent—they can fly themselves, compensate for shifting winds, and even  land automatically. Rotary-wing UAVs are like helicopters but with three  or  more  propellers.  A  quadcopter,  for  example,  is  a  rotary-wing  UAV  with four propellers. These rotary UAVs are also intelligent, able to follow  programmed flight paths, and some can even automatically avoid colli- sions, for example. Perhaps the main advantage of fixed-wing UAVs over  their rotary counterparts is that they can travel further distances at faster  speeds and for longer periods of time. Rotary-winged UAVs, in contrast,  are able to take oἀ and land vertically, requiring less space, which can be  a big plus in disaster zones. They can also hover over designated areas,  whereas fixed-wing UAVs would have to turn around and fly back over  the same point.  Kites and balloons also qualify as UAVs, however, and they too can be  used in disaster situations. Often called the worst man-made environmen- tal disaster of our time, the BP oil spill in April 2010 released more than  200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. My colleague Jeἀrey  Warren at MIT had just launched his GrassrootsMapping initiative at the  time to show how a cheap camera attached to a balloon or kite could cap- ture pseudosatellite imagery of a given area.17 He’d already been using this  approach to help marginalized communities in South America establish  rights to their land.18  When the Gulf oil spill happened, BP did its best to “restrict access to  aἀected areas by means of airspace restrictions, closing public beaches,  and preventing boats from entering some areas.”19  Fishermen, who were suddenly out of work, were increasingly frustrated  by BP’s media blackout and the lack of imagery showing how the oil slick  was spreading and aἀecting their livelihoods. So Jeἀrey jumped on the  next flight out to the Gulf Coast, where he worked with fishermen who  were only too happy to help him circumvent BP’s restrictions and map  the disaster using helium-filled balloons. Jeἀrey and other volunteers who  later joined him ended up taking thousands of aerial photographs simply  by attaching cameras to balloons that would often climb to more than 800  feet  250 meters  in altitude. The resulting aerial imagery was shocking.  Jeἀrey and team had captured the true devastation of the oil slick and had    84     Digital Humanitarians   done so at a far higher resolution than the very expensive $300 million  satellites orbiting overhead.  Aerial  images  captured  by  small  UAVs  present  a n umber  of  impor- tant advantages over satellite imagery. First oἀ, cloud cover is regularly  a big challenge for commercial satellites  as is air pollution, incidentally .  Civilian  UAVs  fly  below  the  clouds,  literally  capturing  an  unhindered  bird’s-eye view of the ground. This is especially critical following typhoons  and hurricanes since clouds may linger for days after the devastation. Even  when hazards are not atmospheric—like earthquakes, for example—cloud  cover can still get in the way. This is particularly true in equatorial regions,  where clouds form more often.  Furthermore, timely satellite imagery is typically expensive and difficult  to acquire, particularly if you’re a local or small nongovernmental organi- zation  NGO . Equally problematic are the licensing restrictions that com- mercial satellite companies impose on their imagery, which limits what  the imagery can be used for and with whom  if anyone  it can be shared.  In contrast, a group that deploys a UAV owns the resulting aerial data.  Some colleagues of mine therefore hope that we’ll continue to see more  use of “open data” standards around aerial imagery than is the case with  satellite imagery. In addition, it generally takes 48 to 72 hours to task a  satellite over an area of interest. In contrast, a locally deployed UAV can  capture imagery within hours and even minutes if local teams are already  on standby. Even simple balloons can capture imagery at a much higher  spatial resolution than today’s most sophisticated commercial satellites.  Moreover, UAVs can take multiple pictures  or videos  of the same areas  several times every hour, whereas it takes a satellite 1 to 5 days to snap a  picture of the same area twice. In other words, the UAV imagery can be  used to identify rapid changes over time. Would you rather be blind for a  couple of hours or a couple of days during a disaster?  Either way, building your own satellite will set you back $300 million  and another $100 million to launch it, plus $2 million more per year to  operate it.20 Humanitarian organizations and NGOs cannot possibly own  and deploy their own satellites due to costs and required technical exper- tise. UAVs, however, are far more accessible, cheaper, and easier to use.  In 2013, no fewer than 270 companies in 57 countries were producing  UAVs.21 Some experts even believe that one in five people will have access  to some kind of personal UAV in the future.22 While this remains to be  seen, the cost diἀerential between satellites and small but sophisticated  UAVs is astronomical. Want to buy your own UAV? A balloon-making    Crowd Computing Satellite and Aerial Imagery     85  kit will cost you at most $85. Of course, balloons have a number of limita- tions—you can’t really control them for starters. But they can be used for  reconnaissance purposes, to identify which spots need to be captured with  a fixed-wing or rotary-wing UAV. Today, personal quadcopters, which cost  around $500, have a range of about 1 to 2 miles. Some UN and Red Cross  colleagues of mine are currently experimenting with these quadcopters.  As a humanitarian colleague recently noticed, for half the price of a lap- top, they can now deploy UAVs to support both advocacy and situational  awareness within hours of an emergency  Figure 4.2 .23  But if you want a small professional-grade UAV ideal for disaster response,  then the one I’d recommend costs around $20,000, which includes the  $6,000 professional software package to create very high quality maps and  3D models. It costs virtually nothing to operate a UAV. While $20,000 is  still a hefty price tag, the cost of professional UAVs will decrease substan- tially in coming years as the market becomes increasingly competitive.  Besides, the $400 million it costs to build and launch a satellite could buy  you 20,000 sophisticated UAVs—enough for 100 cities in every country  around the world to deploy one locally.  FIGURE 4.2 UN OCHA’s first-ever humanitarian UAV for disaster response in Southeast Asia.   86     Digital Humanitarians   In any event, satellites and UAVs  including balloons and kites  are not an  either-or issue; they are complementary data collection technologies. Both  have advantages and disadvantages. So the point is simply for an organi- zation or individual to use the one that makes the most sense for a given  project and to combine these technologies when doing so adds value.  UAVs TAKE OFF IN THE PHILIPPINES When I met Kate Chapman, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap’s director, in  the Philippines, shortly after Typhoon Yolanda, she noted that her team was  using aerial imagery captured by a small UAV to assess disaster damage and  transportation infrastructure in Tacloban, one of the hardest hit cities. The  Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team  HOT  is one of the most remarkable  digital humanitarian groups around. The HOT email listserv includes over  800 digital humanitarian volunteers, although many more mobilize during  deployments, which have included partnerships with multiple humanitar- ian organizations—most recently with Médeçins Sans Frontières  MSF  in  West Africa in response to the tragic Ebola outbreak in 2014.24 The team  has been going strong ever since the Haiti earthquake, a digital response  that I described in Chapter 1. Indeed, HOT was one of the first to shift from  crowdsourcing to microtasking back in 2011 when they launched their Task  Manager—a dedicated microtasking platform—which makes it easier for  digital  volunteers  to  trace  satellite  imagery  so  that  roads,  buildings,  and  other structures can be quickly mapped and shared on a public website.  Another  key  development  for  the  HOT  network  was  the  launch  of  the  Imagery  to  the  Crowd  initiative  spearheaded  by  the  Humanitarian  Information  Unit  at  the  U.S.  State  Department.  My  colleague  Joshua  Campbell, who was instrumental in launching this project, notes that the  “initiative addresses significant data gaps for humanitarian and development  needs by publishing high-resolution commercial satellite imagery purchased  by the United States Government in a format that public volunteers can easily  map into OSM.” As Joshua rightly notes, the resulting maps help “empower  organizations  and  communities  to  make  important,  informed  decisions  across a range of environmental, economic, and crisis management issues.” When  OCHA  activated  the  Digital  Humanitarian  Network   DHN   in response to Typhoon Yolanda in 2013, HOT used its satellite imagery  microtasking platform to very quickly identify destroyed buildings and    Crowd Computing Satellite and Aerial Imagery     87  trace up-to-date roadmaps of the hardest hit areas, thus providing human- itarian organizations with critical information on which roads could still  be used to provide urgent aid. More than 1,500 digital humanitarian vol- unteers from 82 countries rallied online to create the highly detailed OSM  maps that humanitarian organizations on the ground were in dire need  of.25 The majority of these digital volunteers were from the Philippines.  Others were volunteering from Haiti, Ethiopia, Jamaica, Nepal, Myanmar   Burma , Rwanda, and Venezuela, among other places. One volunteer was  even microtasking from Antarctica!26  In  total,  these  volunteers  made  over  4  million  updates  to  the  origi- nal  OSM  map  of  the  Philippines.  “Our  Task  Manager,  accessible  via  the Internet, has contributed to this success. This coordinating tool has  allowed at certain hours more then [sic] 100 contributors to work simulta- neously from Internet around the world.”27  And now, the HOT network was also microtasking UAV imagery of the  Philippines using the same Task Manager. Corephil DSI, the local Filipino  UAV company, had given them more than 20 gigabytes of new imagery  of  downtown  Tacloban  in  order  to  support  the  disaster  recovery  and  reconstruction eἀorts. When I learned about these eἀorts, OSM’s digital  volunteers were already tracing aerial imagery of Tacloban. This imagery   Figure 4.3  has since been traced by hundreds of volunteers using HOT’s  microtasking server to produce much more up-to-date maps for local gov- ernment and humanitarian organizations.  FIGURE 4.3 Aerial imagery captured by UAVs in the Philippines.  From DSI Corephil.    88     Digital Humanitarians   Corephil DSI was not the only Filipino company using UAVs to cap- ture aerial photographs in the wake of Typhoon Yolanda. Another local  start-up, SkyEye, Inc., partnered with the University of the Philippines in  Manila and the University of Hawaii in Honolulu to capture high-resolu- tion UAV imagery of other hard-hit areas, including islands that had been  overlooked by mainstream relief eἀorts. When I connected with SkyEye’s  CEO Matthew Cua, he and his team were preparing to head back to the  most devastated islands that had taken the brunt of Yolanda. Their mis- sion? To capture a second round of up-to-date imagery to support post- disaster recovery and reconstruction eἀorts.  Matthew refers to their project as the xUAV initiative. What does the x  stand for? “Expendable,” he replied. The partners are taking a local, grass- roots approach to the use of UAVs for disaster response. As such, these UAVs  need to be low cost and easy to use if local communities are to deploy them  in response to disasters. To this point, one of the project’s main priorities is  to transfer their skills to young Filipinos, giving them hands-on training in  science, math, and engineering in the process. An equally important and  related priority is the group’s focus on developing sustainable local partner- ships with multiple stakeholders, including local government.  In preparation for the next Typhoon season, Matthew and company  have  already  trained  four  local  teams  across  the  Philippines  to  deploy  xUAVs  in  the  event  of  another  disaster.  He’s  not  the  only  one  already  thinking about the next typhoon season. My colleague Adam Klaptocz,  who founded Drone Adventures and works for the UAV company sense- Fly, is doing just that in partnership with the Swiss humanitarian orga- nization  Medair.  Adam  launched  Drone  Adventures  to  demonstrate  positive social uses of UAVs, and he’s been very busy ever since. In 2014,  Medair invited him to the Philippines as they were in dire need of aerial  imagery to inform their recovery and rehabilitation eἀorts. For 2 weeks,  Adam and his team snapped hundreds of aerial images, which enabled  them to create a very detailed set of 2D and 3D terrain models of the  disaster-aἀected areas where Medair works.  As a representative from Medair noted during the UAV flights, “Recovery  from a disaster of this magnitude can be complex. The maps produced from  the images taken by the drones will give everyone, including community  members themselves, an opportunity to better understand not only where  the greatest needs are, but also their potential solutions. The images will  be made public for free online, enabling community leaders and humani- tarian organizations to use the information to coordinate reconstruction    Crowd Computing Satellite and Aerial Imagery     89  eἀorts.”28 Adam and team also produced hard copies of the maps and gave  them to the local communities they worked in. Because paper-based maps  are easily damaged, they found a local banner shop nearby and paid the  owner to print several copies of their maps on durable, waterproof ban- ners that could easily be rolled up when transported.  “I hate to fly,” Adam told me when I caught up with him at senseFly’s  headquarters  in  Lausanne,  Switzerland.  He  had  just  returned  from  the  Philippines but wasn’t referring to the long 15-hour flight back home. The  UAVs that senseFly design and build are fully autonomous flying robots.  You simply use senseFly’s mapping program to create the flight path you  want, specifying which areas to fly over  waypoints  and at what altitudes.  When  they’re  done,  the  UAVs  slowly  land  themselves  within  meters  of  the landing site you’ve designated on the map. That’s all there is to it. The  remote control that comes with senseFly’s UAVs is really more for decora- tion. “Nobody really uses remotes anymore,” Adam confirmed.  Adam and his colleagues at Medair are now preparing themselves for  the next typhoon season. Their goal is to have a rapid response UAV team  available within 24 hours of a disaster. This will be a new challenge for  Adam and colleagues at DroneAdventures as they’ve never been involved  in rapid disaster response operations. Their UAV project in Haiti with the  International Organization for Migration  IOM , for example, took place a  few years after the 2010 earthquake. “So we’re figuring out what our stan- dard operating procedures should be for a more rapid response,” Adam  explained. One of his main concerns is getting the data out to humanitar- ian organizations and the public so they can be used. “Have you heard of  the Humanitarian UAV Network?” I asked.  HUMANITARIAN UAV NETWORK While drones carry a negative connotation, so did satellite imagery. Many  of us may not remember the stigma around satellite imagery. Indeed, sat- ellites had a direct military connotation—think Sputnik—during the Cold  War. But then Google Earth came around and satellite imagery became  all about finding your house. A recent policy report by the UN noted that  only 1% of all manufactured drones are used for military purposes.29 The  other 99% are used for commercial, civilian, and entertainment purposes.  So it may only be a matter of time until we become more sensitized to the    90     Digital Humanitarians   positive, social uses of UAVs. Public attitude towards UAVs won’t change  over night, however, especially if common misconceptions about humani- tarian UAVs still linger. The first point to keep in mind is that we’re spe- cifically talking about small and ultra-light UAVs such as the eBee, which  weighs 500 to 600 grams, barely heavier than a football or soccer ball. The  eBee, which is a fixed-wing UAV, has a single propeller located at the back  of the wing, so if an eBee somehow hits you while landing, it won’t feel  much diἀerent than a football. UAVs are just like cars, there are safe ways  and reckless ways to drive cars, regardless of whether you have a license.   Note  that  cars  cause  well  over  one  million  deaths  every  year,  but  this  hasn’t changed public attitudes towards cars . There is of course the very  real danger of UAVs colliding with piloted-aircraft. At the same time, I for  one don’t see the point of flying small UAVs in urban areas with complex  airspaces. I’m more interested in using UAVs in areas that have been over- looked or ignored by international relief eἀorts. These areas are typically  rural and hard to access; they are not swarmed by search and rescue heli- copters or UN planes delivering aid. Besides as one UAV expert recently  noted at a leading UAV conference, the best sense-and-avoid systems are  your eyes and ears. Helicopters and military aircraft are loud and can be  heard from miles away. If you’re keeping an eye on your UAV  flying by  line  of  site   and  hear  or  see  piloted  aircraft,  it  takes  you  10  seconds  to  drop to a safer altitude. In any case, flying UAVs near airports without  official, written permission is pure idiocy. Risks  and idiocy  cannot be  eliminated, but they can be managed.  In any event, while the concept of humanitarian UAVs may seem new,  the World Food Program  WFP  has had a team in Italy developing UAVs  since 2007. When I met the team at the University of Torino in late 2007,  I was struck by the fact that WFP already had the ability to deploy its  UAVs but kept its birds grounded since legislation around their use had  not been written. When I got back in touch with the University of Torino  in 2014, their UAVs were still grounded. But there was hope. The Italian  Civil Aviation Authority had just released the country’s first set of regula- tions on the use of UAVs, which provides a lot more flexibility for flying  UAVs weighing less than 2 kilograms. So the team in Torino is now look- ing into lighter UAVs than the ones they had in 2007. In the meantime,  WFP remains one of their key partners. In fact, they were recently talking  with WFP’s Regional Bureau in Bangkok about potential next steps. “But  nothing operational, for the moment,” they added.   Crowd Computing Satellite and Aerial Imagery     91  While a lot has changed since 2007, questions around safety, privacy,  etc.,  still  stand  and  need  to  be  addressed  earlier  rather  than  later.  An  unprecedented number of small UAVs were used to collect imagery after  Typhoon Yolanda, which is a sure sign of things to come. So what happens  the next time? Will we see several dozen UAVs flying around, some piloted  by companies, others by NGOs and journalists, or even tourists who may  happen to be in the area? There was no coordination between the UAV  teams operating in the Philippines after Yolanda—most didn’t even know  about each other. This presents some serious concerns around coordina- tion, safety, and privacy, not to mention a host of legal issues. There are  also important policy and ethical questions vis-à-vis humanitarian uses  of UAVs. Finally, humanitarian organizations and UAV groups are not in  touch with each other; so the former don’t understand the technology, and  the latter don’t know who to share their imagery with.  This  explains  why  I l aunched  the  Humanitarian  UAV  Network   UAViators  together with several advisory board members.30 The purpose  of this network is to connect humanitarian practitioners, policy makers,  and UAV experts to ensure that UAVs are used safely and responsibly dur- ing disasters. As such, UAViators works to facilitate the coordination of  UAV flights and to encourage the sharing of aerial imagery while setting  standards for the use of UAVs in humanitarian settings. We’ve also pub- lished a Code of Conduct to raise awareness on how to use UAVs safely  and responsibly for disaster response. In addition, we recently launched  a crisis map of aerial photos and videos of disaster areas, for example.31  The purpose of this map is to rapidly crowdsource relevant imagery that  can provide humanitarian organizations with a better understanding of a  disaster situation. The map also serves to raise awareness about how to use  UAVs safely and responsibly. How? Anyone wanting to post their videos  on the UAViators map must also read our Code of Conduct. In the future,  we hope to have humanitarian organizations as well as UAV manufactur- ers publicly endorse this Code of Conduct.  UAViators  also  has  a s trong  focus  on  grassroots  capacity  building  to  encourage locally deployed and coordinated UAV flights during disasters.  To  this  end,  the  advisory  board  of  UAViators  includes  Kate  from  HOT,  Adam from DroneAdventures, Matthew from SkyEye, as well as colleagues  from the UN and Red Cross. Together we advocate for direct community  engagement around the use of UAVs in both disaster and postdisaster set- tings. As one colleague who recently returned from a UAV project in Haiti  told me, “The UAV is the uniting tool that binds the community together.”32   92     Digital Humanitarians   AERIAL SELFIES FOR DISASTER RESPONSE When I checked in with Matthew Cua and team at SkyEye after their sec- ond UAV mission to the Philippines islands, they were working hard to  create autopilot software for local communities to autopilot these flying  robots. Matthew’s hope is that the four rapid response UAV teams they’ve  trained will use low-cost tablets to easily program the flight paths of their  UAVs,  which  would  also  minimize  the  chance  for  pilot  error.  When  I  asked Matthew about using crowdsourcing to tag UAV images, he was all  for it and had even experimented with crowdsourcing imagery analysis in  the past. So we’ve set up a partnership to explore the use of MicroMappers  to tag UAV imagery.  As we discovered in preceding chapters, disaster-aἀected communities  often turn to social media when disasters strike. This real-time, user-gen- erated content is a critical source of Big Crisis Data. In addition, we’ve seen  an increase in the volume of multimedia content shared during disasters  since the 2010 Haiti earthquake. This is in part driven by the rapid rise  of the photo-sharing platform Instagram. During Hurricane Sandy, for  example,  Instagram  users  posted  1.3  million  pictures,  with  10  pictures  per second being uploaded during peak periods  further proof that a plat- form like MicroMappers is needed .33 In any event, 1 in 4 of the 20 million  tweets posted during Superstorm Sandy included links to photo and vid- eos, indicating “the degree to which visuals have become a more common  element of this realm.”34  Could this visual Big Data generated during disasters soon include aerial  visuals as well? My colleague Timothy Reuter, who co-founded AirDroids,  is betting on it. Demand for his start-up’s “pocket drones” is through the  roof, both in the United States and around the world.35 Timothy expects  that one in five people will own or have access to a personal UAV of some  type in the future. And AirDroids is not the only game in town. Companies  like 3DRobotics, DJI, and Parrot are also innovating their small UAVs very  rapidly. So the global market for small UAVs is ballooning and becoming  increasingly competitive, which will drive prices down further, just like  smartphones.  So  it  may  only  be  a matter  of  time  until  aerial  selfies  are  posted on social media during disasters—aerial selfies that capture infra- structure  damage  and  related  information  critical  for  disaster  response.  And  unlike  smartphone  pictures,  aerial  photographs  can  cover  a much  wider area, so you only need a handful of personal UAVs in any given area    Crowd Computing Satellite and Aerial Imagery     93  to provide sufficient coverage. In sum, expecting UAV imagery to become a  Big  Crisis  Data challenge may not be as farfetched as one may think. This  explains why my team and I are collaborating with SkyEye and others to  prepare MicroMappers for the potential data deluge driven by small and  personal UAVs.  Recall the MicroMappers platform from Chapter 3. We used the Tweet  and  Image  Clickers  from  MicroMappers  to  make  sense  of  tweets  pub- lished during Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines. We’ve since created an  “Aerial Clicker” to rapidly crowdsource the tracing of aerial imagery. We  simply slice up aerial imagery captured by groups like SkyEye and Drone  Adventures  and  upload  these  micro-images  to  the  Aerial  Clicker  where  volunteers can trace various features of interest, like damaged houses, for  example. If five volunteers each trace the same building in a given micro- image, it means these volunteers independently believe that the building  has been damaged. That building can then be added to a live crisis map  along with tweets and pictures coming out of the Tweet and Image Clickers.  We call this Big Data Fusion.    5  Artificial Intelligence  for Disaster Response  Checkers is one of the oldest games known to humankind. It can be traced  back to the very cradle of human civilization. An archeological expedi- tion  in  the  1920s  in  southern  Mesopotamia—now  modern-day  Iraq— unearthed the oldest checkers board ever found, dating back more than  5,000  years.  Perhaps  the  second  most  important  year  in  the  history  of  checkers  and artificial intelligence  was 1962.  This was the year that a  computer program defeated a human being for the first time—a checkers  champion no less. Developed by IBM, the checkers-playing computer was  the world’s first self-learning program and represents one of the earliest  demonstrations of artificial intelligence.1  LEES’ GUIDE TO THE GAME OF CHECKERS How did IBM pull this oἀ more than a half century ago? It took advantage  of Lees’ Guide to the Game of Draughts or Checkers published in 1893. The  book’s first sentence is telling: “The Game of Checkers, although apparently  simple, is so profound that no player can say ‘I have nothing more to learn.’”2  Lees’ Guide includes hundreds of annotated diagrams that distinguish good  moves from bad ones  as identified by checkers experts . IBM programmed  these moves into their computer so that their program would favor strat- egies taken by experts as often as possible. For example, “Move 1 = Yes”  would let the computer know that playing that specific move was generally  a favorable strategy compared to “Move 2 = No.”  95   96     Digital Humanitarians   In addition to this long list of strategic moves, the program would take  into  account  several  other  factors  while  playing,  such  as  the  number  of pieces on each side and the number of kings, for example. The com- puter would then seek to find the optimal move. If it played a move that  ultimately led to defeat, the program would take note and assign “Move  3 = No.” In 1962, the IBM program beat a checkers champion by the name  of Robert Nealey; the first time that a human player had been defeated by  a computer. After acknowledging defeat, Robert said: “I have not had such  competition from any human being since 1954, when I lost my last game.”  Incidentally, IBM’s stock value went up 15% after this win.3 Although it  took several more decades to design a totally undefeatable computer pro- gram for checkers, this very early win was a momentous milestone for the  fledgling field of artificial intelligence.  The reason that IBM embarked on this early adventure in artificial intel- ligence in the 1960s was not to create computer games, however. It was sim- ply betting on the fact that teaching computers to learn would prove useful  when developing solutions to more general problems such as Big Data. The  company’s bet paid oἀ. In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue computer defeated reigning  chess champion Garry Kasparov. Ten years later, IBM developed Watson, an  artificially intelligent computer system capable of answering virtually any  question posed in English. In 2011, Watson even competed on Jeopardy! and  won first prize  $1 million  after defeating two former  human  champions.  Today, Watson is used to identify the best course of action in lung cancer  treatment at a leading cancer center in the United States. According to IBM,  90% of nurses who use Watson now follow its guidance.4 In short, artificial  intelligence can and already does save lives.  FROM HAYSTACKS TO MEADOWS The overflow of information generated during disasters can be as para- lyzing to humanitarian response as the absence of information. Digital  humanitarians  thus  face  the  challenge  of  having  to  look  for  “needles”  in  a  giant  and  growing  “haystack”  of  information.  In  reality,  however,  there are no ready-made and neatly packaged haystacks. What we’re up  against when battling Big Data is vast meadows of unstructured informa- tion, meadows that stretch from horizon to horizon as far the eye can see.  In fact, the expression “to find a needle in a haystack” originates from    Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response     97  St. Thomas More in the 16th century, who wrote “to seek out one line  in his books would be to go looking for a needle in a meadow.”5 Seeking  out one useful tweet on social media during disasters is like looking for  a needle in a meadow. Over 20 million tweets and more than a million  Instagram  pictures  were  posted  during  Hurricane  Sandy,  for  example.  While the large majority of user-generated content posted on social media  during disasters does not  at present  provide emergency responders with  useful information, we know that a small percentage of tweets, pictures,  and videos are absolutely invaluable to responders and local communities. But  unless  you  have  a m icrotasking  or  crowd  computing  platform   Chapter 3  with a million best friends who are willing and able to help you  search those immense meadows of information for days on end, you’re out  of luck. And even if you did have a million friends ready to crowdsearch  those meadows, would this really be the best use of human time? Our time  on this planet is limited and extremely precious, after all. So if computers  can do the searching with us, or in our stead, well then, what are we wait- ing for? What we need are humanitarian technologies that combine the  wisdom of the crowd with the power of artificial intelligence.  TRACKING THE MEADOWS OF SYRIA The SyriaTracker Crisis Map is the longest-running crisis mapping project  yet, and without doubt one of the most impressive.6 Launched just a few  weeks after the protests began to escalate in early 2011, the crisis map is  spearheaded by just a handful of digital volunteers who have meticulously  and systematically documented and geo-referenced more than 4,000 eye- witness reports crowdsourced from citizen journalists in Syria and some  160,000 official news reports, providing a living record of the horrific con- flict and its aftermath. In 2012, the journal New Scientist reported that the  Syria Crisis Map “could be the most accurate estimate yet of the death toll  in Syria’s uprising . . . and could provide a powerful means to assess the  human cost of wars and disasters.”7  How did these digital humanitarians manage to monitor so much infor- mation  continuously  since  2011?  “We  use  a c ombination  of  automated  ‘data  mining’  and  crowdsourced  human  intelligence,”  Taha  told  me  shortly after he launched the project. Data mining is simply the automated  analysis of large datasets—like datasets of news articles, for example. To    98     Digital Humanitarians   do this, Taha teamed up with the creators of HealthMap, a system that  automatically monitors, detects, and maps reports of global disease out- breaks by mining thousands of online information sources for keywords  that relate to symptoms. HealthMap thus provides timely and “highly local  information about outbreaks, even from areas relatively invisible to tradi- tional global public health eἀorts.”8 This explains why the World Health  Organization  WHO  and regional groups like the European Center for  Disease Prevention and Control use the HealthMap system for digital dis- ease detection.  Taha worked with the HealthMap team at Harvard University to custom- ize the system for SyriaTracker. Instead of looking for disease outbreaks  across the world, the team reprogrammed the system to look for outbreaks  of violence and human rights violations in Syria. Within a few months, the  customized platform known as “HealthMap Crisis” began to mine hun- dreds of news sources for evidence of human rights violations, such as  killings, torture, and detainment. During the first 6 months of operations,  the system collected over 43,000 news articles and blog posts from almost  2,000 English language sources from around the world  including some  pro-regime media sources . “Our data mining platform draws on a broad  range of sources to reduce reporting biases,” Taha explained to me. This  data mining approach has enabled the SyriaTracker team to monitor and  make sense of Big Crisis Data on the Syrian conflict from very early on.  SyriaTracker  combines  the  results  of  this  sophisticated  data  mining  approach with crowdsourced human intelligence, i.e., field-based eyewit- ness reports crowdsourced via web-based forms, email, Twitter, Facebook,  YouTube, and voicemail. Eyewitness reports are subsequently translated,  verified,  and  geo-referenced  by  a d edicated  group  of  digital  volunteers  who triangulate the crowdsourced information with other sources such as  video or photographic evidence and mainstream news reports identified  through the HealthMap Crisis platform. Using this approach, Taha and  his fellow volunteers believe that they’ve been able to verify about 90%  of the documented violence.9 When I spoke to Taha in 2012, he and his  team had also been able to associate specific names to about 88% of those  reportedly killed by Syrian forces since the uprising began. Depending on  the levels of violence in Syria, the turnaround time for a report to be veri- fied and mapped on SyriaTracker is between 1 and 3 days.  In 2011, SyriaTracker was the first to adopt techniques from advanced  computing—data mining—to make sense of Big Crisis Data on the Syrian  conflict. In terms of verification  Chapter 6 , I know of no other public,    Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response     99  volunteer-driven  eἀort  that  has  taken  such  a  meticulous  and  rigorous  approach to documenting the violence in Syria. This may explain why the  U.S. Agency for International Development  USAID  and other humani- tarian  organizations  have  officially  and  publicly  used  the  mined  and  crowdsourced data from SyriaTracker to assess the massive impact of the  conflict on the ground, along with resulting humanitarian needs.  To date, Internet users in more than 2,000 cities and 140 countries around  the world have viewed SyriaTracker’s digital crisis map—with the top 3 cit- ies  being  Damascus,  Syria,  Washington,  D.C.,  and  interestingly,  Riyadh,  Saudi Arabia. The witnessing has thus been truly global and collective. And  when the Syrian regime falls, The New Scientist believes “the data may help  sub-sequent governments hold him and other senior leaders to account.”10  THE RED CROSS DIGITAL OPERATIONS CENTER Wendy Harman and her team of digital volunteers were on high alert at  the American Red Cross’s Digital Operations Center in Washington, D.C.  The  date:  May  20,  2013.  An  absolutely  massive  category  5 tornado  was  tearing  through  Oklahoma  City,  Oklahoma.  The  2-mile-wide  tornado  stayed on the ground for nearly 40 minutes as it left a 17-mile path of total  destruction behind the heavily populated suburb of Moore. The reason  Wendy had several dozen digital volunteers on her team already respond- ing to the disaster in Oklahoma was because she had seen the power of  digital volunteers in Haiti and had closely followed the digital humanitar- ian eἀorts of the Standby Volunteer Task Force  SBTF .  More than 4,000 tweets mention the American Red Cross on an average  day, a figure that skyrockets during disasters like the Oklahoma tornado.11  And when crises strike, so does Big Data. The Digital Operations Center  in D.C. represents the Red Cross’s pioneering eἀorts to manage and make  sense  of  Big  Crisis  Data.12  The  center  itself  sits  three  people  who  have  access to six customized screens that relate relevant information drawn  from various social media channels. Naturally, there’s only so much that  three Red Cross staἀ members can do against Big Crisis Data, which is  why Wendy and her colleagues set up an official digital volunteer program  as part of the center’s operations. The volunteer program oἀers an online  training and certification module to ensure that volunteers are equipped  to support the Red Cross in time of need.   100     Digital Humanitarians   One of the most unique and innovative aspects of the Digital Center’s  work is that the team actively responds to tweets and public status updates  on Facebook. When they find social media users asking for help or for  information  on  Twitter,  they  do  their  best  to  reply  right  away.  Wendy  and volunteers also monitor social media reports for signs of anxiety and  emotional stress in the aftermath of disasters like the Oklahoma tornado.  They reach out to these social media users to provide them with psycho- logical support.  The  center’s  critical  work  becomes  altogether  more  challenging  dur- ing disasters as the team is faced with millions of tweets and Facebook  updates. Knowing this, I emailed Wendy right away to oἀer my support.  “Yes, can you help us identify all references to urgent needs and oἀers of  help on Twitter?” she asked. As Wendy had already realized, using key- words to search for this information on Twitter was a bit of a hit-and-miss  solution. She knew that they were potentially missing thousands of impor- tant tweets—maybe more—since they couldn’t possibly anticipate every  combination of keywords that someone might use to express a need.  So I called my colleague Hemant Purohit, a PhD student at the Kno.e.sis  Center at Wight State University13 at the time. His computer science disser- tation focused precisely on what Wendy needed—the automatic classifica- tion of needs and oἀers of help posted on social media during disasters.14  As it happens, Hemant was already collecting tweets related to the tornado,  so the next step was to use artificial intelligence—machine learning in par- ticular—to automatically identify needs and oἀers of help that were being  posted on Twitter.  Recall  IBM’s  path-breaking  work  in  artificial  intelligence  more  than  a  half  century  earlier  with  its  automated  checkers-playing  program.  Creating computer programs that know how to learn is old news in com- puter science, but artificial intelligence still sounds like science fiction to  many humanitarian organizations. Then again, if IBM’s Watson was able  to answer basically any question posed on Jeopardy! back in 2011, then  surely we can develop computer programs that can automatically tag or  classify tweets by topic area—such as urgent needs. It turns out that this  isn’t a trivial challenge after all, but hardly an impossible one either.  Some 24 hours had passed since the tornado had torn though Oklahoma  and  Hemant’s  dataset  now  contained  some  2  million  tweets.  To  make  sense  of  this  data,  he  developed  two  machine-learning  classifiers  that  would  automatically  classify  tweets  related  to   1   urgent  needs  and   2   oἀers of help. Just like IBM’s early work on artificial intelligence, which    Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response     101  required teaching the checkers-playing program the diἀerence between  good  moves  and  bad  moves,  Hemant  simply  taught  Weka—a  general  purpose machine learning toolkit developed by at Waikato University— to  recognize  the  diἀerence  between  needs-related  tweets,  oἀers-related  tweets, and neither needs- nor oἀers-related tweets.15  To do this, Hemant first had to manually read and collect a relatively  large number of needs- and oἀers-related tweets himself, thus ending up  with two large “bags” of tweets, one filled with needs and the other with  oἀers. To teach an algorithm on the diἀerence between the two bags, a  computer  first  needs  to  read  and  understand  these  tweets.  So  Hemant  used a text classification program that converts every word in a tweet into  a series of codes; you can think of these as barcodes like the one on the  back of this book. When a text classification program is run on a sentence,  each word is given a unique barcode that helps the program understand  what the word means.  Take  the  following  tweet,  for  example:  “We  urgently  need  100  tents  to  shelter  more  people  who  were  made  homeless  by  the  Tornado  in  Oklahoma.” The combination of letters s-h-e-l-t-e-r here would be coded  as “Word Shelter = Yes” since shelter is indeed a word rather than a num- ber or punctuation mark. So Y would be the first “bar” in our barcode.  Given that the word shelter appears only once in the tweet, “Frequency  Shelter = 1”.  And  since  shelter  appears  as  the  fifth  word  in  that  tweet:  “Position Shelter = 5”. So the barcode for the word shelter in this particu- lar tweet would simply be Y.1.5.16 In reality, each word will actually have a  barcode with hundreds of thousands of bars capturing all kinds of crazy  features and attributes.17 All the barcodes in a given tweet are then com- bined to create a “tweet code.” So you can imagine just how much data a  text classification program generates for any given tweet—easily a hun- dred bars per tweet.  To determine the similarities between each tweet in one of Hemant’s  bags is thus anything but trivial. Remember, you’re not looking for identi- cal tweet codes  those only exist if you have two exact tweets . What you’re  actually looking for are tweet codes that are similar but not identical. So  you’re basically comparing individual strands of “DNA” across tweets and  looking for similar animals. But there are so many combinations of bars  that even a small bag of tweets presents a major computational challenge.  Fortunately, a well-established research field has already developed some  robust solutions to this problem.18   102     Digital Humanitarians   The  field  of  statistical  machine  learning  has  been  around  for  many  years. This field studies diἀerent methods to automatically find relation- ship between bars across barcodes, that is, between elements in large-scale  data. This is where the learning in statistical machine learning comes in;  the  machine  learns  to  find  statistical  relationships  between  billions  of  bars in millions of tweet codes. This is what enabled Hemant’s program  to ultimately come up with an overall “bag code” for each bag of tweets he  collected. The bag code for the bag of needs-related tweets, for example,  simply reflects the combination of tweet codes that indicate the presence  of a need. And once we have the bag code for needs-related tweets, we can  use it automatically to bag any number of new tweets related to needs.  Now, the larger your initial bag of manually tagged needs-related tweets  is, the more examples  or barcodes  the algorithm has to learn from, and  thus the more accurate the automated tagging  or bagging  is.19 So the key  with machine learning is to have enough training data on hand to teach the  computer. Once Hemant was satisfied with the accuracy of his bag codes for  needs-related and oἀers-related tweets, he simply applied the bag codes on  the 2 million remaining tweets he had collected, and within seconds found  all tweets related to needs and oἀers of help. I quickly reviewed the auto- matically tagged tweets and shared them with the Red Cross.  So what did Wendy find in these two bags of automatically tagged tweets?  About 7% of these tweets  ~146,000 tweets  were related to donations of  resources and services such as money, shelter, food, clothing, medical sup- plies, and volunteer assistance. Many of the donations-related tweets pro- vided relevant information, e.g., “As President Obama said this morning,  if you want to help the people of Moore, visit [this link].” Approximately  1.3% of the tweets  about 30,000 tweets  referred to the provision of financial  assistance to the disaster-aἀected population. Just over 400 unique tweets  sought nonmonetary donations, such as “please help get the word out, we  are accepting kid clothes to send to the lil angels in Oklahoma.Drop oἀ.”  Exactly 152 unique tweets relating to oἀers of help were posted, with the  vast  majority  of  these  asking  about  how  to  get  involved  in  helping  those  aἀected by the disaster. For example: “Anyone know how to get involved to  help the tornado victims in Oklahoma?? tornado oklahomacity” and “I  want to donate to the Oklahoma cause shoes clothes even food if I can.” We  quickly realized that some of the posted needs and oἀers of help could actu- ally be matched automatically, making the notion of a “Match.com” for disas- ter response a distinct possibility. Hemant has since been working to develop    Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response     103  machine-learning classifiers that not only identify relevant needs oἀers from  Twitter automatically, but also suggest possible matches as a result.20  Some readers may still be surprised to learn that only several hundred  unique tweets  out of 2 million  were related to needs oἀers. The first point  to keep in mind is that social media complements rather than replaces tra- ditional information sources. All of us working in this space fully recog- nize that we are looking for proverbial needles in giant meadows. But these  needles may contain important, even life-saving information available in  real  time.  Second,  a s ignificant  number  of  disaster  tweets  are  retweets   i.e., forwarded tweets . This is not a negative: Twitter is particularly use- ful for rapid information dissemination during crises. Third, while there  were only 152 unique tweets oἀering help, this still represents over 100  Twitter users who were actively seeking ways to volunteer within 48 hours  of the disaster. In the future, these volunteers could be recruited as digital  humanitarian volunteers on MicroMappers, for example.  Moreover, by identifying who is oἀering what, Wendy and her team  could help channel this goodwill in more informed and eἀective ways.  Indeed, one of the biggest challenges that humanitarians face in the after- math of disasters is when well-meaning people donate a vast amount of  useless materials.21 So identifying who is mobilizing online to collect and  distribute donations is of great interest to our colleagues at the American  Red Cross.  Last, and perhaps most importantly, technology alone will not solve the  needle-in-a-meadow problem. Since humanitarian organizations don’t ask  eyewitnesses on social media to report information on needs and impact,  groups like the Red Cross have to rely on witnesses sharing relevant infor- mation by chance. So these organizations end up spending an inordinate  amount of time looking through Big  Crisis  Data just in case there’s relevant  information. But there are several innovative policy strategies that can be  implemented to dramatically reduce the size of the Big Data meadow. Digital  humanitarians who responded to the Arab Spring identified these strategies  early on. We’ll be revisiting this important point in Chapters 9 and 10.  TAKING ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Yes, we could conceivably create machine-learning classifiers  or bag codes   every time humanitarian organizations respond to a new disaster. But we    104     Digital Humanitarians   realized early on that this would take forever. An automatic classifier for  “urgent needs” resulting from a tornado in the United States, for example,  simply  does  not  work  well  when  applied  to  tweets  generated  following  a  cyclone in Australia. In other words, classifiers are sensitive to the type of  hazard and also the country experiencing said hazard since people tend to  express themselves diἀerently across cultures and languages. So teaching a  classifier to identify “urgent needs” in English is perfectly fine, but you’d need  a separate classifier to find “urgent needs” posted in Spanish, for example.  Creating  every  conceivable  classifier  per  country  and  hazard  across  dozens of languages—thousands of classifiers—would be near impossible,  however. Besides, we wouldn’t have the training data or the language skills  to create hundreds of these classifiers ourselves, nor could we anticipate  every single topic that humanitarian organizations might be interested in  monitoring on Twitter. Most importantly, we did not want to become a  bottleneck during disasters. That is, we didn’t want to delay any digital  humanitarian eἀorts if we were not immediately available to create new  classifiers at 3 o’clock in the morning  due to time zone diἀerences, for  example . Thus was born the idea for AIDR—the Artificial Intelligence for  Disaster Response platform.22  What if we placed humanitarian organizations—and digital humanitar- ian volunteers—in the driver’s seat? Instead of us having to create machine  learning classifiers, we could simply develop a user-friendly platform for  humanitarians  to  easily  create  their  own  classifiers  on  the  fly.  In  other  words, we could crowdsource the creation of hundreds of classifiers. My  colleagues only want to work on hard problems—in fact, they insist on it.  So we created AIDR. Like MicroMappers from Chapter 3, the AIDR plat- form is free and open source. Open source simply means that anyone can  take the underlying program code and improve it or customize it to meet  their needs if they wish.  The first real test of AIDR took place in 2014, when a massive 8.2 earth- quake struck oἀ the coast of Chile shortly before 9:00 p.m. local time. About  20 minutes later, a 7-foot tsunami barreled through the town of Iquique.  I had woken up unusually early that morning and jumped on the AIDR  platform as soon as I read the news. Using AIDR to create a classifier is  really  quite  straightforward.  You  simply  log  in  using  your  Twitter  user- name and password and start by collecting tweets. To do this, you simply  tell the AIDR Collector what keywords or hashtags you’re interested in, like  ChileEarthquake. If you wish, you can also specify the geographical region  you want the tweets to come from and have the option of restricting the    Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response     105  tweets you’re collecting to a certain language  or set of languages . Once  that’s sorted, the AIDR Collector automatically collects all the tweets that  meet  your  specified  criteria.  If  that’s  all  you  want,  then  you  can  simply  download your bag of tweets at any time for subsequent analysis.  To bag specific tweets of interest, you simply use the AIDR Classifier.  This feature lets you create a title for your classifier or bag, such as “Urgent  Needs,” along with a set of related tags—or topics—that you’re interested  in  capturing,  e.g., “Shelter  Needs,”  “Information  Needs,”  and  “Food  Water Needs.” Once that’s done, you just pop over to the AIDR Tagger  and start teaching AIDR by manually tagging relevant tweets. That is, you  simply click on incoming tweets that relate to “shelter needs,” “informa- tion needs,” and “food water needs.” In the background, AIDR adds these  tweets to your “Urgent Needs” bag and uses statistical machine learning  to create a “bag code” for urgent tweets.  If  you’re  pressed  for  time,  you  can  also  crowdsource  the  teaching  of  AIDR. Recall how digital humanitarian volunteers tagged some 30,000  tweets related to Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines  Chapter 3 . They  used the Tweet Clicker. Each tweet had been tagged by at least five indi- vidual volunteers for quality assurance purposes, so only if there was con- sensus between volunteers that relayed an urgent need did that tweet get  geo-referenced and added to a crisis map. So once you’ve created your bag  on AIDR, the platform automatically creates a Tweet Clicker for digital  volunteers to tag along and bag more relevant tweets, which in the process  gives AIDR even more tweets to learn from. As the African saying goes,  sometimes it takes a village to raise a child. The same is true with AIDR. Once  enough  tweets  related  to  “urgent  needs”  are  tagged  by  digital  humanitarian volunteers, AIDR will know it’s time to leave the nest and  fly on its own. In other words, it will start to autoclassify incoming tweets  by itself. At present, AIDR can autoclassify some 30,000 tweets per min- ute; compare this to the peak rate of 16,000 tweets per minute observed  during Hurricane Sandy. Of course, AIDR’s first solo “flights” won’t always  go smoothly. But not to worry, AIDR will let you know when it needs a  little extra help. Every tweet that AIDR autotags comes with a “confidence  level.” That is, AIDR will let you know: “I am 80% sure that I’ve classified  this tweet correctly.” If AIDR has trouble with a tweet, i.e., if its confidence  level is 70% or below, then it will ask you  or other digital volunteers  to  classify that tweet so it can learn from you. In other words, the more tweets  you manually tag, the more AIDR learns, and the higher AIDR’s confi- dence levels get. To view the results of AIDR’s machine tagging skills, you    106     Digital Humanitarians   simply click on the View Download tab, which shows you the latest tweets  that have been autotagged along with the corresponding confidence score.  You can then download all the autotagged tweets into a spreadsheet for  further analysis.  Our AIDR deployment for the Chile earthquake resulted in the collec- tion of around 1 million tweets, two-thirds of which were in Spanish. Our  English-language classifier for relevant disaster-related tweets included the  tags  “Casualties Injuries,”  “Caution Advice,”  “Infrastructure  Damage,”  “Donations,” and “Oἀers of Support,” for example. Since we were pressed  for time, we crowdsourced the teaching of AIDR by inviting digital humani- tarians from the Standby Volunteer Task Force  SBTF  to help us manually  tag tweets using the Tweet Clicker from MicroMappers. In total, digital vol- unteers tagged over 1,000 tweets to train AIDR, which enabled the machine- learning  platform  to  automatically  tag  some  10,000  tweets.  On  average,  AIDR’s confidence scores were remarkably high: 94% for “Caution Advice,”  92% for “Oἀers of Support,” and 91% for “Casualties Injuries.”  The  Spanish  language  classifier  received  over  1,000  manually  tagged  tweets  from  volunteers,  and  AIDR  subsequently  classified  over  20,000  tweets automatically. That classifier drew on a similar list of tags as the  English  one  above,  but  also  included  “Urgent  Needs”  and  “Donations  of  Supplies,”  for  example.  The  overall  confidence  scores  for  the  auto- tagged Spanish-language tweets were slightly lower, however, with accu- racy scores ranging around 80%. In any event, the classifier was able to  automatically identify 181 tweets related to “urgent needs” with an 81%  confidence  score  based  on  just  55  human-tagged  tweets.  Incidentally,  these figures also reveal just how apt an analogy looking for needles in  a  meadow  is.  Together  with  AIDR,  volunteers  identified  236  Spanish- language tweets related to “urgent needs” in a meadow of some 650,000  tweets. Those tweets relaying urgent needs thus represented 0.03% of all  Spanish-language  tweets  generated  in  the  aftermath  of  the  earthquake  and  subsequent  aftershocks.  Digital  humanitarian  volunteers  were  able  to find 55 of those tweets within hours, while AIDR was able to find the  remaining 181 tweets within the blink of an eye.  Rereading these results makes me realize just how far we’ve come as  digital humanitarians since the terrible earthquake in Haiti on January  12, 2010. For the first time since that horrible tragedy, we actually have  a fighting chance to win future battles with Big Data without exhaust- ing ourselves and burning out in the process. During the digital human- itarian response to Haiti, volunteers had to manually read hundreds of    Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response     107  thousands  of  tweets  for  weeks  on  end,  literally   Chapter 1 .  And  many  of these tweets were emotionally difficult to read given people’s repeated  pleas for help. Following Typhoon Yolanda in 2013, we were able to auto- matically filter the 250,000+ collected tweets down to about 55,000 unique  tweets. We then used MicroMappers to microtask most of those tweets   Chapter 3 .  In  contrast,  digital  humanitarian  volunteers  responding  to  the Chile earthquake in 2014 only had to tag 1,000 tweets to have AIDR  instantaneously find more than 20,000 relevant Spanish language tweets  from a  total  of  more  than a  half-million tweets. Since  20,000  tweets is  still quite a large amount of information to sift through, we’re develop- ing a simple data visualization output page so that one can easily identify  interesting data trends based on AIDR’s results. We’re also looking to rank  resulting tweets based on how “actionable” they are for disaster response  so humanitarian organizations can prioritize these.  We learned quite a bit from this first AIDR deployment in Chile. My  collaborator  Alexandra  Olteanu  from  L’École  Polytechnique  Fédérale  de  Lausanne wrote up a few of these lessons, which were shared with digi- tal humanitarians.23 When collecting tweets during the first few hours of  a  disaster,  for  example,  your  best  bet  is  to  start filtering  by  geographic  area because Twitter users don’t necessarily have a consensus on the right  hashtags to use in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. But the major- ity of tweets coming from Chile after the earthquake will be about the  earthquake, regardless of the keywords being used. “After 12 hours or so,  collecting by keywords is best, because there are already a few hashtags  for the event, and because people start speaking about other things on  Twitter so collecting or filtering by geography introduces a lot of noise,”  notes Alexandra. By “noise” she simply means tweets that have nothing to  do with the earthquake.  So that’s basically all there is to AIDR. I’ll simply add that you can reuse  your  classifiers.  If   when?   another  earthquake  strikes  Chile,  you  won’t  have  to  develop  a n ew  classifier  for  “urgent  needs”  from  scratch.  You  can autotag incoming tweets immediately with the classifiers that were  already developed for the 2014 earthquake. Plus, you can share your clas- sifiers with your colleagues and organizations if you like. What we envis- age is an “app store” of classifiers based on diἀerent hazards in diἀerent  countries. Remember, the more we reuse our classifiers, the more accurate  they become. And so, while the original seed for AIDR grew from Robert  Nealey’s  loss  to  a  checkers-playing  computer  in  1962,  everybody  wins  when humans and machines work together.   108     Digital Humanitarians   THE UN’S BIG  SMS  DATA PROBLEM So what else do we have in store for future developments of AIDR? Well,  we’re collaborating with UNICEF to modify AIDR so that it can auto- matically classify text messages  SMS  in real time. UNICEF’s SMS-based  U-Report project has been rolled out in dozens of countries around the  world,  including  Burundi,  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo,  South  Sudan, Uganda, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. In Uganda, the UNICEF  team is already receiving well over 10,000 text messages every week from  Ugandan youths who use the U-Report platform to text in their views on  a range of social issues. Some messages are responses to polls created by  UNICEF,  while  others  are  unsolicited  reports  of  problems  that  youths  witness in their communities. About 40% of text messages received by  UNICEF require an SMS reply providing advice or an answer to a ques- tion, while 7% of messages require immediate action. Over 220,000 young  people in Uganda have enrolled in U-Report, with 200 to 1,000 new users  joining on a daily basis.24  UNICEF doesn’t have enough staἀ to manually analyze this high vol- ume and velocity of incoming text messages. While our UN colleagues  had earlier experimented with an IBM solution to classify the text mes- sages, that solution was not open source and also required the team in  Uganda to ask IBM for new classifiers every time they needed to monitor a  new issue. Since IBM scientists are not dedicated full-time to the U-Report  project, this created significant delays for the UNICEF teams in Uganda  who were pressed for time. So this is where AIDR comes in and why we’re  collaborating directly with UNICEF.  Naturally,  AIDR SMS  could  also  have  applications  for  humanitar- ian response. Recall our digital response to the Haiti earthquake in 2010   Chapter 1 . At one point, the telecommunications company Digicel had  oἀered to send a blast SMS to all its mobile phone subscribers  over 1.4 mil- lion people  to alert them of our SMS service and crisis-mapping eἀorts.  We politely declined since we could barely keep up with a few thousand  text messages a day. Thanks to AIDR, we should soon be able to partner  with  radio  stations,  telecommunications  companies,  and  humanitarian  organizations to automatically classify and make sense of millions of text  messages per hour.25  Why radio stations? Local radio stations are often a critical source of  information for communities, especially in countries where Internet access    Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response     109  is not yet widespread. Following a disaster like Typhoon Yolanda in the  Philippines, local radio stations could invite listeners to text in their infor- mation needs to a free SMS number provided by a phone company. We  could then create machine-learning classifiers to automatically classify the  information needs of disaster-aἀected communities into diἀerent catego- ries. Radio stations could then put together radio programs that answer  those information needs. In addition, they could share the results of the  automatically classified text messages with relevant humanitarian organi- zations. If one recurring information need has to do with health issues,  for example, then those text messages could be sent directly to the World  Health Organization team in the Philippines so that it can work with local  radio stations to provide more regular and targeted information updates.  While AIDR is still under development, you can try it out for yourself at   Digital-Humanitarians.com.    6  Artificial Intelligence in the Sky  On  January  31,  1998,  former  U.S.  Vice  President  Al  Gore  described  his  vision for a Digital Earth—a virtual representation of the Earth connecting  the world’s digital knowledge archives. This multi-resolution, three-dimen- sional representation of our blue planet would make it possible to visualize  and make sense of the vast amounts of spatial imagery and geo-referenced  information on our physical and social environments.1 Today, satellite and  aerial imagery provides humanitarian organizations with a visual represen- tation of the Earth during relief eἀorts. As noted in Chapter 4, groups like  Humanitarian OpenStreetMap, Tomnod, and Zooniverse have all turned to  microtasking to make sense of this “Digital Earth.” But even then, micro- tasking alone can’t actually keep up with 1.5 million square miles  4 million  square kilometers  of new satellite imagery produced every day—a figure  that will increase substantially within just a few years.2  Back in 2011, my colleague Pierre from DigitalGlobe  DG  was already  describing satellite imagery as a Big Data problem. Today, DG captures  30% more satellite images than it did in 2011. The company’s total global  archive of satellite imagery will soon hit 2 billion square miles  5 billion  square kilometers . So even if enough digital volunteers were magically  interested in sifting through billions of images on a daily basis, would  that actually be an appropriate use of precious human time?  Located  on  the  scenic  shores  of  Lake  Maggiore  in  Italy,  the  European  Commission’s Joint Research Center  JRC  is recognized as one of Europe’s  leading institutes for cutting-edge technology research and development.  And as it turns out, one of the JRC’s main areas of applied research is the  automated analysis of global high-resolution satellite imagery.3 When I first  met Martino Pesaresi at the JRC in 2009, he and his team were just getting  started on imagery analysis. More than 5 years had already gone by since  that meeting, so I figured it was high time to pay the JRC another visit.  111   112     Digital Humanitarians   MACHINE LEARNING WITH PICTURES Martino hadn’t changed a bit when I found him at his desk on a cool spring  day in 2014. His dry sense of humor still made me laugh out loud, and he  was as passionate as ever about sharing his work. But imagine my surprise  when Martino began using terms like machine learning, automated clas- sifiers, and training data to describe his latest satellite imagery projects.  These were the exact same concepts we were using to make sense of social  media during disasters. But instead of tweets and text messages, Martino  was dealing with satellite images.  So while we were busy manually tagging tweets related to “infrastructure  damage” to teach our machine learning classifier using AIDR  Artificial  Intelligence for Disaster Response , Martino and team were manually tag- ging satellite images for features of interest like “infrastructure damage” to  teach their image-based classifier. Let’s say that Martino is looking at a satel- lite image of downtown Port-au-Prince after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Just  like the letters s-h-e-l-t-e-r form a word in a tweet referring to shelter needs  after a disaster, the pixels on a satellite image may also “spell” structures  of interest, like a damaged rooftop. So instead of using a text classification  program to make sense of the words in a tweet, Martino uses an image clas- sification program to make sense of the pixels in a satellite picture.  Recall the barcode analogy we used in Chapter 5 to explain text classifi- cation. Every word in a tweet can be described in various ways. If the word  “Shelter”  is  capitalized,  for  example,  it  would  be  coded  as  “Capitalization  Shelter = Uppercase.” As noted in Chapter 5, there are hundreds of thousands  of ways to describe a word. One way to think about these descriptors is to  imagine them as the bars of a barcode. A text classifier thus creates a barcode  for each word in a given tweet. Taken together, these barcodes are combined  to create a tweet code for any given tweet. A text-based machine-learning clas- sifier will then seek to automatically classify all tweets that have similar tweet  codes, like tweets referring to “infrastructure damage,” for example.  As it turns out, this analogy also holds true when using machine learn- ing for imagery analysis. Any given rooftop in Martino’s collection of roof- top images will have many diἀerent attributes associated with it, such as  size, shape, color, and so on. In one given satellite image of Port-au-Prince,  for example, Martino spots a damaged rooftop. So he carefully traces this  rooftop and adds it to his collection of rooftop images. This rooftop hap- pens to be small, rectangular, and gray. So an image classifier would create    Artificial Intelligence in the Sky     113  the following barcode for this structure: “S = Small, Rectangular, Gray.”  In reality, the bars in this code would be a lot more specific, like the exact  dimensions of the rooftop  width and length  along with the exact shade  of gray. In fact, hundreds of diἀerent geometric and chromatic attributes  are included as part of the rooftop’s barcode.  AUTOMATED IMAGERY ANALYSIS  OF HAITI AND BEYOND In  one  recent  project,  Martino  and  team  were  tasked  with  finding  the  location of countless piles of rubble scattered across Port-au-Prince, lin- gering reminders of the tragic earthquake in 2010. According to the UN,  some 200,000 buildings collapsed in the capital and surrounding areas  after the earthquake. This resulted in massive amounts of shattered con- crete  and  twisted  steel,  equivalent  to  10  World  Trade  Center  sites  and  enough to fill 2,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools with debris.4 I had  visited Port-au-Prince a half-dozen times in 2011, and during my last trip  there I could still see mounds of rubble lining or blocking some of the  streets. Port-au-Prince is a compact city filled with many narrow streets.  Traffic congestion was already a huge obstacle before the earthquake, but  the rubble made it much worse, literally slowing down reconstruction and  development projects. By 2012, only half of the rubble had been removed.  So European organizations still working in Haiti today wanted to carry  out a full-scale assessment of just how much rubble was left and where.  Martino and company got to work. They acquired very high-resolution  imagery  of  Port-au-Prince   Figure  6.1   and  began  by  manually  tagging  areas with rubble to create the necessary “training data,” after which they  ran their image classification program to automatically identify rubble- filled areas. The result? It took less than an hour of computer time for the  classifier to identify virtually all remaining rubble across Port-au-Prince.  Martino  used  the  results  to  create  a l arge  heat  map  of  the  capital  that  depicted areas still riddled with rubble. And since the JRC’s automated  rubble-detection classifier has an accuracy rate of 92%, the classifier is suf- ficiently reliable for future rapid damage assessment purposes as well.5  In a related project, the group developed machine-learning algorithms  to  automatically  detect  infrastructure  damage  captured  in  high-resolu- tion satellite images following major disasters. In fact, they had taken this    114     Digital Humanitarians   FIGURE 6.1 Aerial image of rubble in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.  From JRC.  project one step further by developing classifiers that could automatically  identify just how severely a building had been damaged, and even whether  a previously destroyed building was being rebuilt. But Martino is quick  to point out that image-based machine-learning classifiers do not “port”  well. By this he means that an infrastructure damage classifier for Port-au- Prince does not work as well when applied to satellite images of Santiago,  Chile, for example. The same holds for text-based classifiers. But just like  AIDR, the JRC team could also reuse their image classifiers should disas- ters strike the same areas in the future.  As we learned in Chapter 4, population displacement is also a major  issue during disasters and can further exacerbate a humanitarian crisis  if not responded to immediately. To be sure, disease outbreaks are par- ticularly common after large numbers of people are displaced and forced  to live in informal shelters. Recall the satellite imagery project in Somalia   Chapter 4 . The UN Refugee Agency  UNHCR  needed a way to assess  the total number of internally displaced Somalis during the crisis to coor- dinate its relief eἀorts. So I asked Martino about the possibility of using  automated methods to estimate the number of people aἀected by a disaster. As it turns out, Martino and team had already looked into automatically  estimating  refugee  populations  based  on  very-high-resolution  satellite  imagery. They developed a highly accurate classifier that could automati- cally pick out informal shelters within a large refugee camp in the Sudan.    Artificial Intelligence in the Sky     115  This gave them an overall estimate for the total number of shelters, a fig- ure that humanitarian organizations could then use to approximate the  refugee population. While we had crowdsourced the tagging of shelters  in Somalia using microtasking, Martino and his colleagues had simply  tagged some shelters themselves and then automatically classified the rest  using machine learning.  What about assessing the number of displaced persons when they’re actu- ally on the move? Can satellite imagery identify the total number of refugees  walking across a border, for example? Martino had a classifier for that as  well. But he was quick to clarify that the classifier in question would only  work on the high-resolution satellite images he had used to train his classi- fier. These images were of the Chadian border taken during a refugee crisis.  Martino could tell I was confused and not following. Indeed, why would a  classifier only work for just those set of images and not others taken the next  day or just a few hours later? “Because of the shadows!”  It just so happens that Martino’s classifier was not actually looking for  pixels of walking people, but rather their shadows. I didn’t follow at first,  but then it dawned on me. What do I look like to a seagull flying high  overhead when it looks straight down at me? Like a dot, of course! And  human dots are really hard to diἀerentiate from all the other dots that  crop up on satellite images. But like Peter Pan, our shadows give us away.  So Martino’s classifier was specifically looking for shadows since these are  easier to identify than human dots. And the reason his classifier could  only work on those specific images? The sun. The images in question had  been taken within seconds of each other when the sun was at a specific  point in the sky. An hour later and the angle of the shadows along with  their lengths would change, which the classifier couldn’t deal with.  Other kinds of shadows are also useful for automated imagery analysis,  like the shadows of buildings, for example. In fact, these can be used to  automatically estimate the height of hundreds of shelters and other build- ings. The JRC can then use these data to develop full 3D models of a town  or refugee camp. So shadows are really key. “But satellite companies don’t  like shadows,” Martino told me, with a hint of scorn. “They get in the way  and make images look less clear, less clean.” This explains why the vast  majority of satellite images are taken between 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m.  local time. Satellite companies believe they can capture the clearest images  of the planet during that time and with very little shadow and fewer clouds.  So Martino and company have very little shadow to play with when devel- oping their machine learning classifiers, which also explains why these    116     Digital Humanitarians   classifiers are so sensitive and cannot be used on other images taken at  diἀerent times—even minutes later since the angle of the camera will be  diἀerent.  My colleagues at the JRC don’t get to control those cameras in the sky. In  contrast with social media, governments and humanitarian organizations  have the option of creating designated hashtags and inviting eyewitnesses  to post reports using specific terms and syntax. But Martino and team  don’t have this kind of luxury with satellite images. Like card players, they  have to do the best they can with the images they’re dealt, images cap- tured by diἀerent satellites using diἀerent technologies taking diἀerent  images at diἀerent angles and at diἀerent minutes during the day. Talk  about complex Big Data!  Like social media, however, there’s obviously an element of urgency in  some of the projects that Martino leads in the aftermath of disasters. “If  we don’t acquire the imagery and analyze it within 48 hours, it’s often  too late.” Many of Martino’s humanitarian colleagues won’t even look at  the results of his analysis if they receive them more than 48 hours after a  disaster! This anecdote is supported by a recent survey of emergency man- agement professionals carried out by FEMA—the U.S. Federal Emergency  Management Agency. The results reveal that 90% of emergency managers  consider the 24-hour mark as the threshold—the sell-by date for action- able crisis information. Only 40% of responders claim that 72-hour-old  data are still timely enough to base decisions on.6  COMING SOON: SATELLITE ALCHEMY An orbiting satellite will take multiple pictures of the same place within  seconds. Why? In part because each picture is taken using diἀerent sen- sors or lenses, including visible light  which we’re most familiar with  and  infrared, for example. The latter—also called thermal imaging—captures  temperature diἀerences of the planet at a high spatial resolution. And so  any given area of the planet that a satellite happens to fly over is photo- graphed several times within seconds using a diἀerent lens. But Martino  is actually less interested in the various sensors. He’s more interested in  the fact that any given place is photographed multiple times in just a few  seconds. Unlike Martino, what most satellite imagery experts overlook is  the fact that those seconds can tell you a lot about what’s happening—or    Artificial Intelligence in the Sky     117  changing on the ground. If a car happens to be driving when those pic- tures are snapped using diἀerent lenses, the position of the car will change  in each image. So you can determine in which direction the car is travel- ing. “Wow, so could you also identify the direction in which displaced  populations are headed after a disaster?”  Martino usually answers all my questions with a yes, but not this time.  Because  the  satellite  images  are  taken  so  quickly  through  the  diἀerent  lenses, only objects that are moving faster than 10 kilometers  6 miles  per  hour can be captured moving in a given direction. Still, this new area of  research will open up all kinds of possibilities for humanitarian response  since the direction of anything moving faster than 6 miles per hour will be  identifiable using automated satellite imagery analysis.  Another area that has been largely ignored by satellite imagery experts  is the vast treasure trove of images captured by Landsat.7 The Landsat pro- gram is the longest-running satellite imagery project in the world. The  first Landsat satellite was launched in 1972, and the most recent in 2013.  Now,  while  Landsat  satellites  are  able  to  produce  new  imagery  for  the  entire globe every 3 years or so, the main drawback is that these images are  all very low resolution. The early satellites could only capture imagery at  300-meter resolution  just over 300 yards . So anything on Earth that was  much smaller than 300 meters in length or width would not appear very  clearly on a Landsat image. The more recent Landsats have had a resolu- tion ranging from 15 to 60 meters depending on the sensor or lens used.  Given that today’s most sophisticated commercial satellite can capture  images with up to 31 centimeters resolution, many imagery experts who  are not focused on environmental monitoring have largely ignored Landsat  images. But not Martino, who recently worked on an ambitious project to  automatically identify buildings in urban vs. rural areas across the globe.  The purpose of this project was to estimate the increasingly rapid pace of  urbanization. Martino and his JRC colleagues acquired very high reso- lution satellite imagery since they wanted the most accurate population  estimate possible. But very high-resolution imagery is not available for the  entire globe, unlike Landsat’s low-resolution imagery. So the team in Italy  needed a way to transform the low-resolution imagery into high-resolution  imagery. In other words, they needed a really fancy pair of “eyeglasses” to  more clearly see individual features in the low-resolution images. Using a  novel technique, Martino and team took the building-detection classifier  they had developed for high-resolution imagery and applied it to Landsat’s  low-resolution imagery. This had the eἀect of “converting” low-resolution    118     Digital Humanitarians   images of urban areas into much higher resolution images. Incredibly, this  new pair of glasses allowed the JRC to revisit the low-resolution images  and actually see them at a higher-resolution. Martino had a big grin on his  face. “Satellite alchemy!” he beamed.  I was just stunned when he showed me the results on one of his many  large computer screens. Martino had somehow developed a cross-resolu- tion image classifier that could automatically identify buildings regardless  of whether the images were of high- or low-resolution quality, and just as  accurately. As I was pondering this thought, Martino pulled up a low-res- olution image of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, on his screen. “Before,  and now, after,” he said with a click of the mouse. The after image showed  where  the  classifier  had  identified  thousands  of  individual  buildings— even though those same buildings were not discernible with the human  eye  in  the  low-resolution  image.  “Real-life  alchemy,”  Martino  repeated  with a grin.  Two words immediately came to mind: Planet Labs. As mentioned in  Chapter 4, I’m collaborating on a project with Planet Labs and Zooniverse  to microtask satellite imagery analysis. Unlike any other commercial sat- ellite  company  today,  however,  the  constellation  of  28  micro-satellites  launched by Planet Labs gives the company near-real-time imagery of any  place on Earth. So we no longer need to wait 48 to 72 hours for satellite  images when a disaster strikes. Thanks to Planet Labs, we can get satel- lite imagery within hours to rapidly assess disaster damage and identify  other features important to humanitarian relief eἀorts. There’s a c atch,  however: the imagery captured by those micro-satellites is quite low reso- lution—3 to 5 meters. But Martino’s satellite alchemy could potentially  identify infrastructure damage in these low-resolution images automati- cally. So we may dabble in a little satellite alchemy ourselves in the near  future to explore this further. In the meantime, what Martino’s “alchemic  jump” from low- to high-resolution imagery means for disaster response  is that we’ll have far more baseline data  the before images  to compare  post-disaster images  the after images  with, which is huge.  While sitting in Martino’s office, I couldn’t help but notice an intriguing  video on one of his four large computer screens. The animation showed a  satellite image of the planet with blotches of various colors growing and  shrinking over time. This single video is what Martino is most excited  about—the word ecstatic may be more accurate—as far as the future of  automated  satellite  imagery  analysis  goes.  Thanks  to  his  breakthrough  in identifying high-resolution features in low-resolution satellite images,    Artificial Intelligence in the Sky     119  Martino was able to turn 20 years worth of low-resolution Landsat imag- ery into an accurate, high-resolution map that captures the global spread  of urban and rural buildings over time. He then used these data to esti- mate population growth over two decades with very high accuracy. These  data are in part what the video was displaying. But Martino also got high- resolution satellite images of the globe at night to animate the change in  electricity production and consumption over the same 20 years. He added  these data to his video of global population growth and wrote a program  to  display  areas  that  had  high  population  growth  but  lower  electricity  use and areas with low population growth but higher electricity use. The  resulting animation is truly spectacular and equally disturbing. You can  find it online at Digital-Humanitarians.com.  GALAXY CLASS MACHINES While the JRC is doing some of the most cutting-edge work in this space,  they are certainly not the only game in town. Remember our Galaxy Zoo  friends from Zooniverse in Chapter 4? More than 80,000 of their digital  volunteers had tagged a million galaxies in just a matter of weeks during  the summer of 2007. For Manda Banerji, a PhD student in London, these  resulting annotations were the equivalent to Lees’ Guide to the Game of  Draughts or Checkers, which IBM had used a half century earlier to teach  its checkers-playing program  Chapter 5 . Galaxy Zoo’s digital volunteers  had produced more than enough training data to teach a computer about  the diἀerences between elliptical and spiral galaxies. In 2009, Manda used  machine learning to demonstrate that galaxies could indeed be automati- cally classified with an accuracy greater than 90% by simply using 10% of  the human-classified imagery  training data  from Galaxy Zoo.8 Perhaps  the  most  intriguing  result  of  Manda’s  study  was  that  the  training  data  from the brightest galaxies tagged by volunteers could be used to accu- rately classify much dimmer galaxies. This means that the 35 million tags  created by volunteers in 2007 is enabling the team at Zooniverse to accu- rately classify hundreds of millions of newly discovered galaxies for many  years to come.  And so, the day eventually came. On August 3, 2012, Chris Lintott from  Zooniverse posted the following message on its blog: “Today’s a bittersweet  day for us, as the Galaxy Zoo project moves oἀ into  perhaps temporary     120     Digital Humanitarians   retirement.”9 For real? “The short answer is that the team have used the  thousands of classifications submitted by volunteers to train a machine  that can now outperform the humans.”10 So this spells the end of citizen  science space exploration.  Not so fast. Each survey of galaxies uses a host of diἀerent methodolo- gies and technologies, which may require entirely new training sets. At  the time, Chris expects that we may eventually “see a pattern developing  in which the early months or years of a survey require volunteer classifica- tion, before relaxing until the next challenge comes along.”11 But things  have gotten even more interesting recently. Zooniverse has basically cre- ated an “AIDR platform” to tag galaxies!12 This means that Zooniverse’s  microtasking platform is also a machine learning system that seamlessly  combines human and machine classifications. What’s more, the system  can  determine  when  it’s  worth  asking  digital  volunteers  for  help—just  like the AIDR platform  Chapter 5 . As Chris rightly notes, this provides  Zooniverse with the best of both worlds: the team can now “take advan- tage of machines for routine tasks, but allow them to call for human help  when they get stuck. The result should be a more interesting project to  participate in, a greater scientific return and the certainty that we’re not  wasting your time. That all sounds pretty good to me.”13  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AT A PROFIT It now makes perfect sense. Back in 2011, my colleague Pierre Izard at  DigitalGlobe   DG   had  told  me  that  satellite  imagery  was  a B ig  Data  challenge that needed “mass human intervention until the software can  catch up.” While he had never heard of the Tomnod microtasking plat- form until I spearheaded the satellite imagery project with UNHCR in  Somalia  Chapter 4 . Pierre must have quickly realized that the Tomnod  platform was the key to his point about mass human intervention. But  there’s another reason why DG bought the platform in 2013 and moved  Luke Barrington and company to its headquarters in Boulder, Colorado. Tomnod deployments generate a massive amount of training data for  automated  satellite  imagery  analysis.  In  other  words,  volunteer-driven  human tagging at scale was not just a temporary plan B for DigitalGlobe  until artificial intelligence could catch up to fully automate the process.  Large-scale,  crowdsourced  human  tagging  was  the  enabler  for  DG’s    Artificial Intelligence in the Sky     121  plan A—namely, using the crowd to improve machine learning algorithms  for automated satellite imagery analysis to increase profits. DG, after all,  is the largest commercial provider of satellite imagery in the world, and it  plans on staying in the lead by providing its clients with state-of-the-art  solutions for imagery analysis.  At the end of a recent talk, my colleague Luke summed up his vision for  the future of DigitalGlobe and Tomnod: “I want to use the power of the  crowd to crowdsource the world.”14 This—crowdsourcing—was perhaps the  missing link in Al Gore’s vision of a Digital Earth back in 1998. It certainly  seems today that we can only begin to make sense of Big  Spatial  Data if we  combine crowdsourcing with machine learning. The results will enable us  to view and hopefully understand our planet at an unprecedented digital  resolution. Gore’s Digital Earth may soon be a reality thanks to the power of  the crowd. So may the crowd be with you, young Luke.  AUTOMATED ANALYSIS OF UAV IMAGERY Typhoon Yolanda made landfall at 6:00 a.m. local time on November 8,  2013. When the Joint Research Center  JRC  team in Italy was activated 6  hours later, their first step was to identify which regions of the Philippines  were likely to have been the hardest hit. By the time they had enough infor- mation to submit a request for very high resolution satellite imagery of  those areas, it was 9:00 a.m. on November 10—just over 50 hours after the  typhoon had reached the mainland. The team received the imagery within  10 hours of their request. The analysis was carried out and the results were  communicated to humanitarian partners a few hours later. This satellite- based  disaster  damage  assessment  of  the  Philippines  identified  which  individual  shelters  in  the  most  devastated  areas  had  been  destroyed,  highly aἀected, moderately aἀected, or possibly aἀected. Responders on  the ground had this information overlaid on a crisis map some 64 hours  after landfall, namely, at 10:30 p.m. local time on November 10. They’d  have to wait a further 8 hours for the sun to rise before they could focus  their eἀorts on the hardest hit areas identified on JRC’s map.  In  short,  72  hours  had  transpired  between  the  typhoon  reaching  the  Philippines and the operational response supported by the satellite imag- ery analysis. According to JRC, this is about the average time it takes to  carry out this kind of disaster damage assessment. In some cases, it can    122     Digital Humanitarians   take much longer. “It once took us 10 days,” Peter Spruyt told me with  a hint of a Dutch accent. “The entire storm-aἀected area was covered in  clouds for almost 2 weeks,” he said while shaking his head with disap- proval.  But,  as  we’ve  already  heard,  unmanned  aerial  vehicles   UAVs   were being used at the same time in the same areas to map the disaster.  For Peter, the potential delays with satellite imagery explains his growing  interest in UAVs. Luckily, his new mandate at the Joint Research Center is  to do just that—drive the center’s work on the use of UAVs for rapid aerial  imagery acquisition and analysis. His goal? To provide the kind of analysis  they carried out after Yolanda, but within 24 hours instead of 64. To this  end, Peter field-tested a UAV in the Balkans during the massive floods of  2014. He flew a light, fixed-wing UAV in five locations to support rapid  data and needs assessment in close collaboration with the UN and the  World Bank.15  Peter states unequivocally that “aerial imagery is about to become a Big  Data problem.” So automated aerial imagery analysis will be the way to go.  Recall Martino’s project in Haiti, which automatically identified rubble  piled up across Port-au-Prince. That imagery was actually captured by a  UAV—not by an orbiting satellite. This explains why Martino’s machine  learning  classifier  was  so  accurate.  UAVs  can  capture  aerial  images  at  spatial  resolutions  that  are  10  times  greater  than  the  best  commercial  satellites.  Indeed,  UAVs  can  capture  images  at  1–2-centimeter  resolu- tion if need be, compared to 40+ centimeters for most commercial satel- lites.16 The most sophisticated commercial satellite today, DigitalGlobe’s  Worldview-3, provides imagery at 31-centimeter resolution. In any event,  aerial imagery has higher color definition, which means more features can  be identified. In sum, the higher the resolution, the higher the accuracy  of the machine-learning classifiers, the greater the number and variety  of individual features that can be automatically identified, and the more  complete the resulting disaster damage assessment.  When I spoke to SkyEye Inc.’s CEO, Matthew Cua, about microtasking  the analysis of his UAV imagery in the Philippines  Chapter 4 , he noted  that he was already testing automated methods to make sense of aerial  imagery. “My students and interns are tagging our images and delineating  certain things like coconut trees, rice paddies, roads, houses, etc. We’ll  then use the data to train our algorithms to autotag some of these fea- tures. Right now we are very successful with coconut trees; we just need to  reduce the false positives that occur in certain situations so we need more  datasets to train our algorithms better.”17 A false positive is simply another    Artificial Intelligence in the Sky     123  way of saying “mistake.” A false positive in the case of coconut trees is  when Matthew’s machine-learning classifier thinks an image has coconut  trees when it actually doesn’t.  So my team and I are exploring ways to help SkyEye create more train- ing data by using MicroMappers. As noted in Chapter 4, we’re developing  an  Aerial  Clicker  for  MicroMappers  so  that  digital  humanitarian  vol- unteers can trace and tag aerial images captured by SkyEye’s UAVs, for  example. But we want to take it one step further. After all, as is clear from  this chapter, microtasking alone is not a sure bet against Big Data. We  need  humanitarian  technologies  that  combine  human  computing  with  machine computing—microtasking with artificial intelligence—to really  make sense of Big Data. So we’re collaborating with Martino at JRC to  explore how to add image-based machine learning to the Aerial Clicker.  Our ideal scenario? When digital humanitarian volunteers use the Clicker  to trace features of interest to disaster responders such as damaged build- ings, the Clicker begins to recognize similarities between the manually  traced  features  and  then  automatically  finds  all  other  damaged  build- ings in the remaining aerial imagery. Whether we can really pull this oἀ  remains to be seen.  We’re not the only ones exploring ways to leverage advanced comput- ing for aerial imagery analysis. My colleague Tom Snitch is often in South  Africa where he flies fixed-wing UAVs over Kruger National Park. Why?  The number of rhinos killed by poachers had increased 10 times in just  the past 5 years alone.18 “These are not amateurs; most of them are highly  trained mercenaries and very well equipped,” Tom told me when we met  at the Cosmos Club in D.C. after one of his recent trips. “This is basically  low-intensity conflict,” he added.  Tom is a distinguished senior professor at the University of Maryland’s  Institute for Advanced Computer Studies. He previously worked on geo- spatial predictive analysis at the commercial satellite company GeoEye.  Back  in  Maryland,  Tom  and  colleagues  have  successfully  created  the  world’s first analytical model for poaching behavior. “Using high-resolu- tion satellite imagery, exquisite mathematics, and UAVs, we have created a  model that shows us how animals, rangers and poachers move simultane- ously through space and time,” Tom explained. It gets even more impres- sive.  Not  only  have  Tom  and  company  developed  pattern-recognition  algorithms that can automatically identify a poacher, but their algorithms  can also determine the type of weapon that said poacher is carrying. This  kind of automation is key since rangers don’t have time to sift through    124     Digital Humanitarians   aerial imagery. Besides, even if they did, it would be too late to dispatch a  team to intercept the poachers. The aerial imagery has to be captured and  automatically analyzed by the computer onboard the UAV in real time,  which is where Tom’s algorithms come in.  Might we be able to apply these algorithms to other types of crises, like  humanitarian disasters? “Now that we have perfected the algorithms, we  can take the approach anywhere in the world,” he answered. To be sure,  the  algorithms  could  be  modified  to  support  disaster  response  eἀorts,  such as locating refugee flows. For now, though, Tom and team are prepar- ing to extend their good work on wildlife protection to Kenya and Gabon,  and maybe Nepal in the future.   7  Verifying Big Crisis Data   with Crowd Computing  “We just need to make sure you’re not Gaddafi!” said the note to digital  volunteers joining the Libya Crisis Map eἀorts on behalf of the United  Nations. As you may remember from Chapter 3, the UN Office for the  Coordination of Humanitarian Aἀairs  OCHA  had activated the Standby  Volunteer Task Force  SBTF  to create a live crisis map of the humanitar- ian situation in Libya. The purpose of this map was to provide UN agen- cies with greater situational awareness so they could make more informed  decisions regarding their relief eἀorts.  I’M NOT GADDAFI The note to new digital volunteers added the following explanation: “As  you know, the situation in Libya is intense, and there are security chal- lenges in creating a crisis map of a hostile environment. So please don’t  take  it  personally  that  we  ask  about  your  background,  we  just  need  to  make sure you’re not Gaddafi! So the more official information you can  share about yourself, the faster we’ll be able to give you access to the crisis  map. We promise that none of your information you share with us will  ever be made public. We are not Facebook! :  We promise we won’t ask any  more questions after you’ve passed the ‘I’m not Gaddafi’ test!”  With hundreds of digital humanitarian volunteers mobilizing online in  dozens of countries around the world, we needed some way to ensure that  rogue volunteers would not sabotage the crisis map by deliberately add- ing false or misleading information. So I c alled Anahi Ayala Iacucci, a  co-founder of the SBTF who was the lead volunteer coordinator for this   125   126     Digital Humanitarians   operation. We brainstormed a few solutions but recognized that all were  far from foolproof. Still, some measure of vetting volunteers would be bet- ter than none. We wrote the above message to explain why digital volun- teers had to fill out a survey. Only if they passed the “I’m not Gaddafi” test  would volunteers be given a password to edit the crisis map.  The survey asked volunteers to provide their professional or academic  email address rather than a Gmail or Yahoo! address. We also asked for  their Twitter handle and Facebook page. The former would allow us to  read through dozens—hundreds if need be—of the volunteer’s past tweets  to identify any suspicious behavior. Facebook’s terms of service make it  illegal to pose as someone else, so Anahi and I considered that having a  link to someone’s Facebook page was a plus. We also asked for the vol- unteer’s LinkedIn page and for links to any personal or professional blog  or website that could further confirm his or her identity. LinkedIn was a  particularly useful piece of evidence given that the majority of LinkedIn  users are professionals. The blog or website question enabled us to further  triangulate the person’s identity, especially if he or she had written articles  published online. All in all, you can tell a lot about a person just by looking  at his or her digital footprint. Incidentally, the multibillion-dollar com- pany AirBnB takes a very similar approach to vet their members before  allowing them to share their homes with strangers.1  So these were the identifying factors that Anahi and I took into consid- eration when reviewing the digital and social media footprints of more  than 200 volunteers over the course of a couple days. We created a spread- sheet to keep score—with both of us having our own column where we  would either type in yes or no next to a volunteer’s survey results. Only if  Anahi and I both wrote yes next to a volunteer’s name would that person  be given access to the crisis map. We necessarily gave higher priority to  those volunteers who submitted the most information. Overall, about 80%  of the 200+ volunteers who signed up were cleared without requiring any  additional information. For the remaining 20% or so, we followed up by  email to ask for additional evidence. The vast majority of these individuals  responded with extra information. Some even provided us with copies of  their national ID cards and passports!  There’s really no way of knowing for sure whether this vetting process  actually worked. What we do know is that the process was extremely labo- rious and time-consuming. The good news is that we found no evidence  of information sabotage during the 4-week deployment of the Libya Crisis  Map. The bad news is that any disinformation may have been too subtle    Verifying Big Crisis Data with Crowd Computing      127  to identify, like the digital sabotaging that would happen during Russia’s  legislative elections that year.  A DISEASE ON THE MAP OF RUSSIA The  international  media,  along  with  local  independent  media  websites,  reported  serious  irregularities  during  the  December  2011  elections  in  Russia, which included evidence of ballot stuffing and lack of impartiality  by the election commission. The GOLOS Association watchdog reported  extensively on these campaign violations.2 To amplify its eἀorts during  the elections, it partnered with Gazeta, Russia’s leading Internet newspa- per, to crowdsource the reporting of voting irregularities such as bribes  and related violations. It even set up a dedicated phone number for citi- zens to report any irregularities they witnessed. GOLOS then added these  crowdsourced reports to a public map  Figure 7.1 .  FIGURE 7.1 Crowdsourced election map of Russian elections.   128     Digital Humanitarians   At the peak of operations, the map displayed well over 5,000 detailed  reports  of  election  violations  that  covered  the  entire  face  of  Mother  Russia.  There  were  more  red  dots  on  that  crisis  map  than  I ha d  seen  on any other since Haiti. The Kremlin was not amused. These Russian  “Crowdsourcerers” needed to be put in their place. Soon enough, GOLOS’s  main partner, Gazeta, was forced to drop the project due to political pres- sure from Moscow.3 Luckily, the popular blog platform Slon.ru, which has  about 1 million monthly visitors, stepped up to the plate. Vladimir Putin  was  starting  to  lose  his  patience.  So  pro-Kremlin  hackers  knocked  the  crowdsourced monitoring map offline. This provoked the usual cat-and- mouse game between digital activists from both camps. At one point, Slon. ru found a way to evade the censorship and placed the map back online.  But pro-Putin activists were not about to let this stand; they adopted a dif- ferent and ultimately far more eἀective strategy.  My colleague Gregory Asmolov from the Russia Fires Help Map project   Chapter 3  sent me a curious YouTube video during the elections.4 The  video showed a woman holding a phone to her ear while looking at a  large computer screen in front of her with the crowdsourced election map  prominently displayed. She was speaking Russian so I wasn’t quite sure  what was happening until I read the rest of Gregory’s email. The woman  in question was a pro-Kremlin activist who complained to the camera- man that “those red dots are like a disease on the face of Mother Russia.”5  The video shows her calling the project’s dedicated telephone number to  report an incident. When a GOLOS volunteer on the other end answers,  the activist fabricates a report, giving a random location. In other words,  this was an instructional video on how to submit false information to a  crowdsourcing platform.  Gregory sent me a second email a few hours later with more discon- certing news. One of Russia’s state television channels had just broadcast  a program in which it directly accused those behind the map of add- ing false reports to the crowdsourced map, criticizing GOLOS for using  an “American tool” in an eἀort to topple the Russian ruling party. The  head of Russia’s election committee lost no time and submitted a legal  complaint against the map, which resulted in GOLOS receiving a $1,000  fine.6 Gregory would later note that the government’s nervous reaction  to the map and its attempt to delegitimize it was clear proof of the proj- ect’s impact.7   Verifying Big Crisis Data with Crowd Computing      129  WAG THE DOG OR WAG THE NEEDLE? The overflow of information generated during a disaster can be as para- lyzing to disaster response as the lack of information. So making sense  of this overflow—or Big Data—is imperative. We need new tools to rap- idly find those “needles” in the growing stacks of data that overwhelm  the information landscape during disasters. But even if we do find those  needles—those supposed pieces of useful and actionable content—who’s  to say those reports are accurate? Those “needles” could easily point to  false or misleading information.  According to Gregory, the quality of crowdsourced information sim- ply mirrors the reliability of society. So if there is low confidence in the  reliability  of  crowdsourced  information,  Gregory  believes  that  this  is  a  diagnosis of society and not the crowdsourcing tool itself. Disinformation  may very well reflect all that’s rotten in the state of Denmark—to quote  Shakespeare—but how do we manage this problem now rather than later?  Perhaps the answer is to be found in Hollywood.  I once wrote that falsifying crowdsourced data can be a pain in the back- side and drew on one of my all-time favorite movies to explain why.8 Wag  the Dog, which stars Dustin Hoἀman and Robert De Niro, begins with a  U.S. president caught making advances to an underage girl just 2 weeks  before election day. De Niro, a master spin doctor, is brought in to ensure  the president gets reelected by diverting the public’s attention from the  exploding scandal. To do so, De Niro fabricates a fake war with Albania  and hires a Hollywood producer  played by Hoἀman  to create fake news  footage of this war. Hoἀman assembles his brain trust, and together they  end up creating much more than fake footage, ultimately getting the presi- dent reelected.  Based on this premise, I argued that if someone  say a dictator  wanted  to pretend that citizens had violently attacked well-behaved anti-riot pol- icy units—and if said dictator wanted to convince the rest of the world  beyond  any  reasonable  shadow  of  a d oubt—then  wagging  the  “needle”  would  probably  require  the  following  recipe:  dozens  of  pictures  of  dif- ferent quality from diἀerent types of phones of fake rioters taken from  diἀerent angles at diἀerent times; dozens of text messages from diἀerent  phones using similar language to describe the fake riots; several dozens  of tweets to this same eἀect, not just retweets; several fake blog posts and  Facebook groups; several YouTube videos of fake footage from diἀerent    130     Digital Humanitarians   vantage points; hacking national and international media to plant fake  reports in the mainstream media; hundreds of  paid?  actors of diἀerent  ages and genders to play the rioters, military police, shopkeepers, onlook- ers, etc.; dozens of “witnesses” who can take pictures, create video foot- age, etc.; a cordoned-oἀ area in the city where said actors can stage the  scene. Incidentally, choreographing a fight scene using hundreds of actors  definitely  needs  time  and  probably  requires  rehearsals;  a s cript  would  help; props including flags, banners, guns, etc.; ketchup, lots of ketchup;  weather consistent with the weather on the supposed day that the violence  took place—if it was raining during the acting, it better be raining when  the dictator wants to use that false data.  Of course, dictators and other misfits don’t need to prove anything to any- one, and certainly not beyond a reasonable shadow of a doubt either. But the  Wag the Dog analogy may still shed some light on how we might go about  verifying potentially dubious claims on social media. Perhaps all we need is  a digital Sherlock Holmes—or a thousand, rather.  DIGITAL SHERLOCK HOLMES The Arab Spring was in full swing when my colleague Andy Carvin began  to play a central role in the verification of social media coming from Egypt  and neighboring countries. Andy, formerly at National Public Radio  NPR ,  applied his investigative journalism skills with finesse online. He began  following the events on Twitter in December 2010, just as the situation in  Tunisia was beginning to boil over. But he didn’t just follow, he actively  investigated dubious claims by asking his Twitter followers for additional  evidence, placing the burden of proof on them to triangulate and track  down clues. Several times a day, Andy would retweet information about  an incident and add: “Source?” or “Anyone else reporting on this yet?” He  would also ask for pictures or videos to confirm or dispel a rumor.  When asked exactly how he judges the accuracy of the information he  receives via Twitter, Andy replies that he simply looks for red flags, like  when “non-journalists adopt the language of breaking news, like tweets  that include the words ‘breaking’ or ‘urgent’ in all capital letters.” Those  citizen reporters are often hearing all kinds of rumors, and they get very  excited, so they pass on this information as quickly as possible; their sense  of urgency is what compels them to forward unconfirmed reports just in    Verifying Big Crisis Data with Crowd Computing      131  case they turn out to be true. “The vast majority of folks that are posting  information, their hearts are in the right place but sometimes the fog of  war aἀects them just as it would any other journalist.”9  One of Andy’s main verification success stories relates to rumors that  Muammar Gaddafi had attacked rebels using mortars made in Israel. A  photograph that accompanied these rumors purported to show a Star of  David with an odd multicrescent shape above it. Andy immediately got  on  Twitter  to  ask  his  followers  for  help:  was  the  mortar  in  the  photo- graph really Israeli? This spurred a flurry of activity, which rapidly helped  debunk the story “even as other news outlets, including Al Jazeera’s Arabic  TV channel, continued to report the bogus link to Israel.”10  Andy’s  investigative  strategies  and  tactics—interrogating  sources,  tri- angulating content—are simply techniques from traditional journalism.  This is what journalists do and have been doing for decades. They gather,  analyze, verify, and disseminate relevant information. The only diἀerence  is that Andy “turned the newsgathering process inside out and made it  public. He’s reporting in real time and you can see him do it. You can  watch him work his sources and tell people what he’s following up on.”11  While Andy has obviously not met the vast majority of his Twitter users  in person, he still draws on them for tips and for their aid in verifying  user-generated content posted across social media. To do this, he relies  on Twitter followers who display professionalism and integrity, those who  demonstrate a positive track record over time.  Naturally, Andy doesn’t always get it right. His Twitter followers often  correct him when his tweets convey the wrong information. The biggest  lesson he learned from this experience in real-time curation and verifica- tion is that “most of the people who try to reach out to you are not trying  to mislead you. It doesn’t necessarily mean that everything they send you  is true but there’s generally a grain of truth in most of what you see.”12 The  key, according to Andy, “is disclosing what he doesn’t know and asking  others to fill in the blanks.” He considers this a “self-correcting mecha- nism.” That being said, it’s important to note that a lot goes on behind the  scenes with respect to Andy’s detective work. He has extensive “backchan- nel conversations on Facebook, on Skype, on email, and occasionally on  the phone…. Facebook and YouTube and other content-sharing sites have  been a goldmine of new content.”13 The fact that he had a network of blog- ger contacts in the region before the Arab Spring is also critical.  Ultimately, Andy is a first-rate digital Sherlock Holmes, drawing on mul- tiple tracks to find a sound that rings true based on his years of experience    132     Digital Humanitarians   as a journalist. And while he refers to what he does as more art than sci- ence, his digital detective skills can be learned and replicated. Indeed, I  believe that this new field of “digital information forensics” can be codi- fied and taught.  THE SKYPE DETECTIVES Whilst Andy drew on a vast network of social media contacts to verify  reports during the Arab Spring, Tattu Mambetallieva used Skype. Rumors  were running rampant in southern Kyrgyzstan during the summer of 2010.  The regions of Osh and Jalal-Abad were experiencing widespread violence,  prompting the country’s interim government to declare a state of emer- gency on June 12, 2010. Reports on how many people were killed were dis- puted, with figures ranging widely between 200 and 2,000. Estimates for  the number of forcibly displaced persons ranged from 100,000 to 400,000.  Rumors were quickly spreading via SMS and YouTube. One rumor, for  example,  suggested  that  humanitarian  aid  was  being  poisoned,  while  another “confirmed” that cross-border attacks were being carried out by a  particular ethnic group.14  I was in Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital, less than a year after the violence  as part of a UN mission exploring the potential use of new technologies  for conflict prevention. While we were there on official UN business, the  government canceled our trip to Osh literally at the last minute, spouting  rubbish about it not being safe. So we stayed in Bishkek and continued our  fact-finding mission by inviting civil society groups from the south to join  us in the country’s capital for a series of in-person workshops. That’s when  I met Tattu, a formidable woman who had launched her own NGO—the  Civic Initiative for Internet Policy.  When word of the conflict began to spread during the summer of 2010,  she created a dedicted Skype chat group and invited her friends and col- leagues  from  other  civil  society  organizations  to  chase  down  rumors.  Within  2 h ours,  some  2,000  people  across  the  country  had  joined  the  online chat, with more knocking, but the group had reached the maxi- mum capacity allowed by Skype.  They later switched over to a web-based  platform to continue the digital detective work.   The Skype chat was abuzz with people sharing and validating informa- tion in near real-time. When someone got wind of a rumor, they would    Verifying Big Crisis Data with Crowd Computing      133  simply jump on Skype and ask if anyone could verify. This method proved  incredibly eἀective. Why? Because members of this Skype group consti- tuted a relevant, trusted, and geographically distributed network. A per- son would only add a colleague or two to the Skype chat if they knew who  this individual was, could vouch for them, and believed that they had—or  could have—important information to contribute given their location or  contacts. This trusted referral system was absolutely key.  There are typically 6 degrees of separation between any two people on  this planet. This means it would only take six people to introduce you and  I to each other.15 Perhaps I have a friend whose sister’s roommate’s teach- er’s cousin’s tennis partner’s friend is you. This means you’re not really a  complete stranger with no connections to me. We could theoretically use  this “six-person-referral system” to vet each other. Far out, right? Well,  the degree of separation between members of Tattu’s Skype group was  closer to 1. Let me explain why this is important with a few real-world  examples from that summer. At one point there were rumors emerging  about a possible attack on the southern border with Tajikistan. A mem- ber of Tattu’s Skype group had a contact within the army unit guarding  that  section  of  the  border.  So  they  called  their  contact  and  confirmed  within minutes that no attack was taking place. As for that other rumor  about the poisoned humanitarian aid, it too was dispelled by the Skype  detectives. The rumor had originated from a series of text messages, so a  member of the Skype group did some sleuthing and found the original  phone numbers from which these SMSs had been sent. She then called a  personal contact of hers at one of the telecommunication companies and  asked whether the owners of these phones were in fact texting from the  towns where the aid was reportedly poisoned; they weren’t. Meanwhile,  another member of the chat group had investigated the rumor in per- son—since they were in one of the towns in question—and confirmed  that the text message was false.16  This Skype detective network proved an eἀective method for the early  detection and response to rumors. Once a rumor was identified and deter- mined to be false, 2,000 people could share that information with their  own networks within minutes. In addition, members of the Skype group  were able to ping their media contacts to quickly counter the further spread  of rumors. In at least two cases and in two diἀerent cities, telecommuni- cation companies also collaborated with the Skype detective network by  sending out broadcast SMS to notify subscribers about the false rumors.   134     Digital Humanitarians   In sum, Tattu’s ad hoc network of local civil society groups was able to  use a free, online instant messaging platform to verify and counter several  rumors in near real time over the course of several days. I was amazed by  Tattu’s remarkable eἀorts and mentioned that her successful initiative had  just confirmed one of my theories about “bounded crowdsourcing.” I had  coined the term a few years earlier as a way to describe a way of collecting  and verifying crisis information.17 This is what I had in mind: You start  with a few trusted individuals and have them start by collecting and veri- fying information. After some time, you ask each of these initial members  to invite a few additional trusted colleagues who they can fully vouch for,  and so on and so forth. Tattu had basically put into practice what had just  been a theory until then.  So, shortly after my visit to Kyrgyzstan, I co-authored a book chapter  with my colleague Jessica Heinzelman: “Crowdsourcing for Human Rights  Monitoring: Challenges and Opportunities for Information Collection and  Verification.”18 Jessica had carried out a number of insightful interviews  with several human rights organizations like Amnesty International and  Human Rights Watch. According to Anna Neistat, associate director of  the  Emergencies  Division  for  Human  Rights  Watch   HRW ,  “getting  information is crucial, especially in areas where [HRW does] not have an  extensive human rights network” like in southern Kyrgyzstan. So crowd- sourcing can be a useful tool for evidence collection and verification.  Immediately following the outbreak of violence in Kyrgyzstan, HRW  sent  a t eam  of  two  researchers  to  monitor  the  human  rights  situation.  With flare-ups dispersed throughout the southern region, researchers had  to move rapidly from one area to the next gathering information through  traditional face-to-face interviews with witnesses. Concerned about the  security of those who had provided reports, they left their mobile phone  numbers and encouraged interviewees to call if they were victims of ret- ribution as a result of reporting information. Originally not intended as a  mechanism for collecting status updates or verifying new incident reports,  the Kyrgyz contacts began calling in with news of arrests, security opera- tions, and other information regarding the rapidly changing conflict. In  some cases they passed the phone numbers on to others in the community  who also contributed information. With limited time and capacity, the  HRW researchers used the information to focus their investigation based  on where the greatest abuses were taking place. So here was yet another  example of bounded crowdsourcing in action.   Verifying Big Crisis Data with Crowd Computing      135  DIGITAL SCOTLAND YARD While I’ve repeatedly shared Andy and Tattu’s stories, many humanitar- ian  profesionals  still  considered  it  impossible  to  verify  user-generated  content. The real breakthrough in this cacophony of cognitive dissonance  came when I stumbled across a blog post on something called the User- Generated  Content   UGC   Hub.  The  British  Broadcasting  Corporation   BBC , a well-recognized and so-called traditional news organization, had  launched the UGC Hub in London way back in 2005, a year before Twitter  even existed.19 And this Hub’s one and only purpose since then has been to  verify user-generated content posted online. These professional investiga- tive journalists had been verifying social media content for a half decade  before the Arab Spring and the violence in southern Kyrgyzstan. Now all I  had to do was point humanitarian skeptics to the BBC as proof that verify- ing social media during disasters was not impossible.  In  2014,  more  than  20  digital  Sherlock  Holmeses  worked  at  the  UGC  Hub—a veritable Scotland Yard for news verification in the 21st century. My  colleague Trushar Barot is the Hub’s assistant editor. Their modus operandi,  according to Trushar, is to get on the phone with whoever has posted the  content they’re trying to verify. In fact, just the process of setting up an inter- view can give important clues about the source’s credibility. Trushar and  company also employ a number of other strategies to investigate the authen- ticity of user-generated content they come across. Pictures and videos, for  example, can reveal the time and place of an incident captured by a camera.  How? Shadows, weather conditions, and sometimes critical clues like num- ber plates and prominent landmarks. The BBC team also uses Google Earth  “to confirm [that] the features of the alleged location match the photo.”20 In  addition, UGC detectives will analyze a photograph’s underlying graphic  file to determine whether the image has been doctored in any way. Videos  can also provide important clues. Dialogue captured in a video can reveal  the accent being spoken, which can in turn be used to determine a person’s  ethnicity and perhaps general location.  Trushar also makes regular use of online tools like TinyEye and Google’s  advanced  picture  search.21  These  tools  enable  journalists  and  others  to  determine whether a given picture has already appeared online, perhaps  years ago and in a context completely diἀerent than the narrative sug- gested on social media. So anyone trying to pull oἀ a Wag the Dog–type  stunt today would have to create original content from scratch.   136     Digital Humanitarians   Trushar and team get it right almost every time, but they’ve had several  close calls. In one incident, they almost fell for a Wag the Dog trick. In April  2013 Trushar came across a very graphic video of a man apparently being  buried alive by Syrian soldiers. The video had not appeared online before,  so he ran the video by an Arabic-speaking colleague at the BBC who con- firmed that the soldiers’ accents were Alawite, the ethnic group that rules  Syria and provides many of its soldiers.22 The sneakers being worn by the  soldiers also checked out, as these were commonly worn in some Syrian  units. But one small detail didn’t seem quite right to Trushar’s colleague.  How could the voice of the man supposedly being buried in sand be  so “consistently audible—unless he has been fitted with a microphone?”23  Plus, why did the video end just a few seconds after the man’s head had  been totally covered? “Was this person simply acting?” he wondered. If so,  this would explain why the video suddenly stopped. The actor needed to  breathe and wouldn’t be able to hold his breath forever. The footage raised  a number of red flags, so Trushar emailed his colleagues at BBC News to  inform them that the video had not passed the Hub’s authenticity test.  Clearly,  one  doesn’t  need  a  full-fledged  Hollywood  studio  to   almost   fool seasoned journalists. Any buἀoon with a camera can give it a try. So  the  Hub is testing the services of Storyful, a novel and successful for-profit  news company that specializes in verifying user-generated content on social  media, especially multimedia content. “At Storyful, we think a combina- tion of automation and human skills provides the broadest solution,” writes  Mark Little.24 In fact, Mark uses the term human algorithm to describe their  approach. In addition to this partnership, Trushar and team are increas- ingly using digital platforms like Twitter’s Advanced Search, TweetDeck,  Geofeedia, NewWhip, Facebook Search, Topsy, Reddit, Bing Social Network,  Google Advanced Search, Banjo, Bambuser, and Addictomatic.25  That’s quite the techie toolbox for a team that brands itself as traditional.  “People are surprised to find we’re not a very high-tech, CSI-type of team,”  Trushar insists. His boss, Chris Hamilton, is more direct and even takes  issues with the term information forensics: “The business of verifying and  debunking content from the public relies far more on journalistic hunches  than snazzy technology. While some call this new specialization in jour- nalism ‘information forensics,’ one does not need to be an IT expert or  have special equipment to ask and answer the fundamental questions used  to judge whether a scene is staged or not.”26 We’ll come back to Chris in  Chapter 8 where we’ll explore the role of advanced computing vis-à-vis  Big  False  Data.  In  the  meantime,  if  you’re  interested  in  learning  more    Verifying Big Crisis Data with Crowd Computing      137  about information forensics, the most comprehensive resource I’ve come  across on this is the Verification Handbook: A Definitive Guide to Verifying  Digital Content for Emergency Coverage, published by the European Center  for Journalism.27  ONE, TWO, TEN RED WEATHER BALLOONS It was 2009 and just another typical autumn day in Boston. Leaves were  turning into pallets of reds, oranges, and yellows. There was a chill in the  air, but the sun had the entire deep blue sky to itself. My colleague Riley  Crane, who had just started his post-doc at MIT, was walking swiftly. The  cool wind didn’t bother him. But time was of the essence. He had just heard  of an intriguing competition that promised a grand prize of $40,000 to the  lucky winners. DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,  would be discretely hoisting 10 red weather balloons across the continental  United States. The challenge? Identify the correct location of each balloon.  He had an idea, but time was short since the competition would be kicking  oἀ in just a few days. Riley was practically running to MIT at this point.  So while we wait for Riley to get to MIT, here’s a quick refresher course on  U.S. geography: together, the 48 contiguous states—and yes, Washington  D.C.—cover a combined area of more than 3 million square miles, or just  over 8 million square kilometers, which is roughly the same size as the con- tinent of Australia. So how exactly did Riley think he’d be able to find 10  “red needles” in this giant “meadow”? By staying right behind his computer  until the job was done, of course! When he finally arrived to the meeting  point on campus, Riley explained his game plan to incredulous colleagues.  The plan was simple: they’d give away the $40,000 in order to win.  Okay,  maybe  not  that  simple.  They  did  pull  an  all-nighter  that  same  night. But by morning, they had developed an online platform that could  decide how to give away the $40,000 in an equitable manner. Riley and  team were planning to use the prize money as an incentive to recruit digi- tal volunteers for their crowdsearching eἀorts. Not only would they give  away $2,000 to each person who found the correct location of a balloon,  the person who had recruited the lucky winner would get $1,000, and the  person who had recruited that person would get $500, and so on and so  forth. That’s what the online platform was for, to recruit, track, and even- tually reward volunteers.   138     Digital Humanitarians   So how long did it take the winning team to find all 10 red weather  balloons planted across 3 million square miles of the continental United  States? Want to guess? Maybe a few weeks? Or a few days? Think again. It  took Riley and team 8 hours and 44 minutes to find all 10 balloons without  ever leaving their laptops.28 And when I met up with Riley shortly after his  victory, he responded to my praise with a disclaimer: “Well, the reason it  took us that long was because other university teams were planting fake  pictures of red balloons and sharing them on social media, so we had to  spend some time verifying each and every clue.” Nevertheless, all 10 bal- loons were found despite the fact that Twitter and other social media plat- forms can be biased, unrepresentative, discriminatory, and plagued with  false information  recall Chapter 2 .  In January 2010, just 3 months after Riley had pulled oἀ what DARPA  earlier described as an impossible challenge, Haiti was rocked by a mas- sive earthquake  Chapter 1 . Later that year, I reconnected with Riley to  explore how we might collaborate in the future. Could his insights into  time-critical crowdsourcing and mobilization be applied to improve our  digital humanitarian eἀorts? If his crowdsearching approach had found  10  balloons  spread  across  3 m illion  square  miles  in  a matter  of  hours,  could we have applied the same technique in Port-au-Prince to find people  trapped under the rubble in just a matter of minutes? After all, the Haitian  capital is only 14 square miles in size compared to the 3 million square  miles of the United States. We continued these conversations for several  months, but a number of academic deadlines got in the way. Our brain- storming sessions were put on hold, alas indefinitely. Or so I thought.  Two years later, a colleague of Riley’s got in touch with me out of the blue.  Iyad Rahwan had been involved with Riley’s winning team back at MIT  and was now an associate professor at the Masdar Institute in Abu Dhabi.  He wanted to continue the conversation that Riley and I had started back  in 2010. So we did, formulating the basis for what would eventually become  the Verily platform.  SURELY, VERILY, TRULY Instead of crowdsourcing the search for red balloons, what if we crowd- sourced the search for truth during disasters? Okay, perhaps that’s a little  too grandiose. So let’s take a few steps back. What if we crowdsourced the    Verifying Big Crisis Data with Crowd Computing      139  rapid search for clues that could help confirm or dispel rumors? Could  we develop a platform like MIT’s to quickly crowdsource the collection  of  evidence  around  specific  but  unconfirmed  reports  shared  on  social  media during disasters?  Take Hurricane Sandy, for example. As noted in previous chapters, more  than 20 million tweets and 1.3 million Instagram pictures were shared  over the course of a week as the hurricane tore through New York toward  the end of 2012. MicroMappers and AIDR didn’t exist at the time, so I  had no way of making any real-time sense of those 20 million tweets, let  alone verifying them. The same was true for the hundreds of thousands  of pictures being shared every day that week. And as often happens when  disasters strike large cities today, rumors and misinformation began to  swirl online.  While  some  pictures  circulating  on  Twitter  during  Sandy  were  obvi- ously fake—my favorite had Godzilla and Puἀ Marshmallow Man posing  with Lady Liberty—others were far more difficult to authenticate. But  a  handful of “digital good Samaritans” took it upon themselves to try and  verify  these  more  difficult  cases.  One  was  a s easoned  journalist,  while  another had extensive skills in photography and graphic design. Between  them they verified dozens and dozens of key pictures, explaining in detail  which ones were fake and why. They did an outstanding job. But what if  they’d been working together? What if they had combined their analysis  and used just one website to share the results? And what if they had invited  digital volunteers to help verify all the other dubious pictures?  As Craig Silverman, an award-winning journalist, noted in 2012, “never  before in the history of journalism—or society—have more people and  organizations been engaged in fact checking and verification. Never has  it been so easy to expose an error, check a fact, crowdsource and bring  technology to bear in service of verification.”29 This is where Verily comes  in. The platform is still very much in experimental stages, but we were very  encouraged by the results of a recent test.30  So here’s how Verily works. The platform gets triggered by a verification  request posed in the form of a yes or no question. Say another earthquake  strikes Chile, and contradictory reports start circulating on social media  about a major bridge collapsing near the capital city of Santiago. You could  post the following yes or no question on Verily: “Has a major bridge near  Santiago really collapsed?” You could then share the link to this verifica- tion request with your Twitter followers, Facebook friends, email contacts,  etc., just like the Red Balloon challenge. And if anyone finds evidence to    140     Digital Humanitarians   either confirm or dispel this rumor, they post the item directly to the web- site containing your verification request.  Verily  seeks  to  rapidly  crowdsource  evidence  to  answer  verification  questions affirmatively and negatively. In other words, digital sleuths are  simply looking for any and all evidence that might answer your verifica- tion question one way or another. It is then up to you to weigh the evi- dence for and against and draw your own conclusions. For journalists like  my colleague Trushar at the BBC, a platform like Verily could help him  outsource and accelerate the collection of evidence, which he would then  verify himself using his traditional investigative journalism skills.  Returning to the previous example of the earthquake in Chile, if I hap- pen to find a picture of a destroyed bridge posted on Twitter, I might then  quickly post this on Verily as a piece of evidence that confirms the rumor.  Whenever  any  digital  sleuth  posts  a p iece  of  evidence   text,  image,  or  video , he or she is required to add a couple of sentences to explain why  they think or know that the evidence he or she found actually answers the  verification question. In other words, Verily doesn’t only seek to facili- tate time-critical crowdsourcing for evidence collection, but also aims to  crowdsource critical thinking, which refers to reasonable reflective think- ing focused on deciding what to do or believe. Critical thinking is key to  countering the spread of false rumors during crises.31  As Yasuaki Sakamoto, a professor at the Stevens Institute of Technology,  notes, “Given the growing use and participatory nature of social media,  critical thinking is considered an important element of media literacy that  individuals in a society should possess.”32 To this point, we want Verily  to deliberately redirect social media traffic to one dedicated platform that  crowdsources  and  incentivizes  critical  thinking.  This  means  that  we’ve  deliberately designed Verily to serve as an educational tool as well as a  magnet for evidence collection.  Colleagues often remind me of the disastrous crowdsearching eἀorts  on the Reddit website following the Boston Marathon bombings in April  2013.33 Reddit, which is ranked in the top-100 most popular websites in  the  world,  is  a very  proactive  social  networking  and  discussion  forum.  Reddit users, called Redditors, created a discussion forum to crowdsource  their digital manhunt for the bombers, which resulted in accusing inno- cent bystanders of planting the bomb.  A number of journalists asked me to comment on the Reddit disaster  at the time. I told them that the fiasco was the result of two main issues:   1   the  crowd  is  digitally  illiterate,  and   2   Reddit  was  simply  not  the    Verifying Big Crisis Data with Crowd Computing      141  appropriate platform for the task at hand. The first factor has to do with  general education. We lack the digital or media literacy required for the  responsible use of social media during crises. The good news, however,  is that the major backlash from the mistakes made in Boston and else- where may serve as an important lesson to many in the crowd. The second  factor has to do with design. Platforms like Reddit, which are useful for  posting pictures of cute cats, are not always the tools best designed for  finding critical information during crises. Don’t get me wrong; I’m a big  Reddit fan myself. But perhaps Reddit’s design doesn’t encourage the criti- cal thinking needed for the verification of rumors. The crowd is willing to  help in the wake of major natural disasters; this much has been proven.  The crowd simply needs better tools that crowdsource the goodwill and  critical thinking of its members.  So why do we think Verily may work? For several reasons. First, the plat- form  is  deliberately  designed  to  crowdsource  critical  thinking.  Second,  digital  good  Samaritans  are  already  incentivized  to  mobilize  and  help  online during disasters. So we don’t need the $40,000 from the balloon  challenge. And third, social ties are far denser in cities and online.  Recall the notion of 6 degrees of separation, that any two individuals on  the planet are separated at most by 6 friends of friends. In densely popu- lated cities like Santiago, Chile, it is reasonable to expect that the social  networks are even denser, which may reduce the average degree of separa- tion to three or even two. On Facebook, global users of the social network  are separated by an average of 4.7 hops—and that was back in 2012.34 An  article in The Economist picked up on this intriguing finding and posed  the following question: “Can this be used to solve real-world problems, by  taking advantage of the talents and connections of one’s friends, and their  friends? That is the aim of a new field known as social mobilisation, which  treats the population as a distributed knowledge resource which can be  tapped using modern technology.”35  The  article  goes  on  to  reference  DARPA’s  Red  Balloon  challenge.  So  maybe there’s something to this. Of course, we’ll only find out by giving  Verily a try. But the reason it may actually work is as simple as it is elegant.  If we’re more closely connected than ever, especially on social media, then  someone living across from that bridge in Santiago, Chile, may be friend of  a friend of mine on Facebook. And by posting my verification request on  Facebook with the link back to Verily, I may be able to recruit this friend of  a friend within just a few minutes. Upon seeing the request, this friend twice  removed could simply pop her head out her window, snap a picture of the    142     Digital Humanitarians   intact bridge with her smartphone, and post it on Verily, confirming that the  rumor is in fact false.  Andy at NPR and Tattu in Bishkek basically took a very similar approach  when they successfully crowdsourced their verification eἀorts. So Verily  would simply facilitate an ad hoc method that has already worked. What do  you think? Want to give it a try?

In early January  2011,  an  area  almost  twice  the  size  of  the  United  Kingdom  was  under  water. As often happens in Australia, the disaster also triggered a flood  of tweets. One of the most active Twitter accounts at the time belonged  to the Queensland Police Service Media Unit, @QPSMedia. And on the  evening of January 11, 2011, the Media Unit began posting tweets with the  hashtag mythbuster to tag rumors and misinformation that were circu- lating on Twitter. These mythbuster tweets were some of the most widely  forwarded  retweeted  messages posted by @QPSMedia. Two examples:  mythbuster: Wivenhoe Dam is NOT about to collapse! qldfloods  mythbuster: There is currently NO fuel shortage in Brisbane. qldfloods  The  mythbuster  hashtag  proved  especially  successful  in  dispelling  the  rumors, which is why the Queensland Police continues to employ this same  tactic to this day.1 The Queensland Police’s hashtag solution is a simple and  elegant way to counter rumors. But how do we detect rumors in the first  place and as early as possible?  ARTIFICIAL RUMORS Rumor mills during disasters are hardly a new phenomenon. A very inter- esting study from the 1950s noted that “in the past 1,000 years the same  143   144     Digital Humanitarians   types of rumors related to earthquakes appear again and again in diἀer- ent locations.”2 For example: “After an 8.1 magnitude earthquake struck  northern India [in 1934], it wasn’t long before word circulated that 4,000  buildings had collapsed in one city, causing ‘innumerable deaths.’ Other  reports said a college’s main building, and that of the region’s High Court,  had also collapsed.”3 Thankfully, these rumors turned out to be false.  In  any  event,  the  BBC’s  User-Generated  Content  Hub  would  have  debunked these rumors if it had been around back then  Chapter 6 . In the  BBC’s opinion, “The business of verifying and debunking content from the  public relies far more on journalistic hunches than snazzy technology.”4 So  it would have been right at home in the technology landscape of 1934. To  be sure, the Hub’s director, Chris Hamilton, contends that “one does not  need to be an IT expert or have special equipment to ask and answer the  fundamental questions used to judge whether a scene is staged or not.”  This apparently doesn’t contradict the fact that Hub journalists make use  of no less than 12 distinct digital platforms to support their verification  eἀorts  none of which existed until a few years ago . In any case, the BBC  journalists do not “verify something unless [they] speak to the person that  created it, in most cases.”5  So what about the other cases? How many of those cases are there? And  how did they ultimately decide on whether the information was true  or  false  even though they didn’t speak to the person that created it? Truth  be told, major news organizations like the BBC aim to contact the original  authors of user-generated content  UGC  not only to try and “protect their  editorial integrity but also because rights and payments for newsworthy  footage are increasingly factors. By 2013, the volume of material and speed  with which they were able to verify it [UGC] were becoming significant  frustrations and, in most cases, smaller news organizations simply don’t  have the manpower to carry out these checks.”6 Hello? Is that you, Big Data?  BBC’S BIG DATA BLUES Recall  from  Chapter 7  that  the  BBC’s  UGC  Hub  began  operations  in  early  2005.  At  the  time,  according  to  a  former  employee,  “they  were  reliant on people sending content to one central email address. At that  point, Facebook had just over 5 million users, rather than the more than  1 billion today. YouTube and Twitter hadn’t launched.”7 Today, more than    Verifying Big Data with Artificial Intelligence     145  100 hours of content is uploaded to YouTube every minute, over a half- billion tweets are sent each day, and over 1 million pieces of content are  posted to Facebook every 30 seconds.8  Of course, technology alone won’t solve the Big Data verification problem.  Claire Wardle, a social media verification expert at Columbia University’s  Tow Center for Digital Journalism, rightly notes that, “No technology can  automatically verify a piece of UGC with 100 percent certainty. However,  the human eye or traditional investigations aren’t enough either. It’s the  combination of the two.”9 The New York Times concurs: “There is a problem  with scale. . . . We need algorithms to take more onus oἀ  human beings,  to pick and understand the best elements.”10 Even journalists at the BBC’s  Hub have recently admitted that it is not immune to Big Data, complaining  that “Twitter search is very hit and miss”; that what Twitter “produces is not  comprehensive and the filters are not comprehensive enough.”11  Verification is often thought of as dichotomous. That is, people  mistak- enly  see “verification as a simple yes no action: Something has been veri- fied or not. In practice,” as Claire rightly states, “verification is a process.”  As such, while snazzy technology may not always prove whether a story is  authentic, said technology may nevertheless oἀer helpful clues that in turn  trigger the verification process. In other words, the verification process is  about satisficing.12 As colleagues of mine at the University of Colorado at  Boulder have noted, “Information processing during mass emergency can  only satisfice because . . . the ‘complexity of the environment is immensely  greater than the computational powers of the adaptive system.’”13  To this end, “it is an illusion to believe that anyone has perfectly accurate  information in mass emergency and disaster situations to account for the  whole event. If someone did, then the situation would not be a d isaster  or crisis.”14 This explains why my Colorado colleagues are trying to shift  the debate: focus on the helpfulness of information rather the problematic  true false dichotomy. This explains why they’re not as quick as the BBC  to dismiss “snazzy” technology. “In highly contextualized situations where  time is of the essence, people need support to consider the content across  multiple sources of information. In the online arena, this means assessing  the credibility and content of information distributed across [the web].”15 It  follows, therefore, that “technical support can go a long way to help collate  and inject metadata that make explicit many of the inferences that the every  day analyst must make to assess credibility and therefore helpfulness.”16  In sum, the human vs. computer debate vis-à-vis the verification of social  media is somewhat pointless. The challenge, moving forward, resides in    146     Digital Humanitarians   identifying  the  best  ways  to  combine  human  cognition  with  machine  computing. “It is not the job of the [. . .] tools to make decisions but rather  to allow their users to reach a decision as quickly and confidently as pos- sible.”17 And if these tools happen to be snazzy while at the same time get- ting the job done, well then, I’ll take snazzy over 1934 technology.  Unlike BBC journalists who only seek to verify information related to  potentially newsworthy stories, digital humanitarians often face the task of  having to very quickly verify dozens, if not hundreds, of nonnewsworthy  reports posted on social media in the aftermath of a disaster. They simply  can’t call and interview everyone bearing witness on social media since  time is of the essence. As one colleague recently observed, “If you have  ‘accurate’ information that is hours old, you don’t have accurate informa- tion in the social media world.”18 Information is the most perishable com- modity in humanitarian response, and user-generated content posted on  social media has a very short shelf life. If the BBC misses a news story or  two because it isn’t able to verify an item, the consequences are minimal.  At the end of the day, “being right is more important than being first.” But  in humanitarian crises, while bad information can also have far-reach- ing negative consequences, so can no information. This trade-oἀ must be  weighed carefully in the context of verifying crowdsourced information  during digital humanitarian operations.  GROUNDBREAKING INSIGHTS FROM CHILE On February 27, 2010, Chile experienced one of the most powerful earth- quakes in recorded human history, measuring a whopping 8.8 on the Richter  scale. Over 2 million people were aἀected. As mentioned earlier, I had woken  up early that morning because I had to prepare for a presentation I’d be giv- ing at Columbia University later in the day. The talk was to focus on our  ongoing  digital  humanitarian  response  to  the  Haiti  earthquake  that  had  struck Port-au-Prince just 6 weeks earlier. When I saw the news about Chile,  I quickly launched a new digital humanitarian operation, and honestly had  no idea how I’d be able to spearhead that eἀort in addition to the one in Haiti.  But I launched a live crisis map for the Chile earthquake all the same and  improvised during my talk at Columbia later that day by sharing the story  of Haiti, and invited students from the School of International and Public  Aἀairs  SIPA  to take over the Chile Crisis Map. And take over they did.   Verifying Big Data with Artificial Intelligence     147  Since the earthquake had taken down major communication lines and  cell phone towers across Chile, the number of tweets dropped consider- ably after the seismic shock and only bounced back 48 hours later. The  team at SIPA did their best to manage the Big Data rebound of more than  4 million tweets. I helped sift through some of this data deluge during the  first few days but then had to get back to the Haiti response. SIPA stu- dents continued crisis mapping for several weeks. Their eἀorts were truly  outstanding—the  grades  on  their  midterm  exams  less  so.  Perhaps  the  most important and longest lasting impact of their commendable eἀorts  was  the  subsequent  launch  of  a d igital  humanitarian  student  group  at  SIPA, which continues to this day.  Several months after the earthquake in Chile, I stumbled across a fasci- nating computer science paper published by Yahoo! Research in Barcelona,  Spain.19 The paper presented the results of a study that had analyzed close  to 5 million tweets posted in the days following the Chile earthquake. What  struck me about this study was that the team also analyzed the spread of  false  rumors  vs.  confirmed  news  disseminated  on  Twitter.  The  authors  “manually selected some relevant cases of valid news items, which were  confirmed at some point by reliable sources.” In addition, they “manually  selected  important  cases  of  baseless  rumors  which  emerged  during  the  crisis  confirmed to be false at some point .” Their goal was to determine  whether users interacted diἀerently when faced with false rumors vs. valid  news. The study revealed that 95% of tweets reporting true information  were confirmed as valid by Twitter users. In contrast, only 0.03% of tweets  denied the validity of these true tweets. Interestingly, the results also show  that “the number of tweets that deny information becomes much larger  when the information corresponds to a false rumor.” In fact, about 50% of  tweets will deny the validity of false reports.  The authors thus concluded that “the propagation of tweets that corre- spond to rumors diἀers from tweets that spread [accurate] news because  rumors tend to be questioned more than [accurate] news by the Twitter  community.  Notice  that  this  fact  suggests  that  the  Twitter  community  works like a collaborative filter of information. This result suggests also a  very promising research line: it could be possible to detect rumors by using  aggregate analysis on tweets.” Two years after this study was published,  one of the co-authors, Carlos Castillo  ChaTo , became a close collabora- tor while at Qatar Computing Research Institute  QCRI . What’s more,  ChaTo had continued his research on automatically detecting rumors on    148     Digital Humanitarians   Twitter during those 2 years. And the results were about to take the media  by storm in December 2012.  Entitled  “Predicting  Information  Credibility  in  Time-Sensitive  Social  Media,” the follow-up study co-authored by ChaTo revealed what the title  suggested: they had developed an automatic and remarkably accurate clas- sifier to identify credible information on Twitter.20 They analyzed the 5 mil- lion tweets from the Chile earthquake and found “a correlation between  how information propagates and the credibility that is given by the social  network to it.” Indeed, when studying false rumor propagation, the analy- sis confirmed that “false rumors tend to be questioned much more than  conﬁrmed truths.” If all of this technical language sounds Greek to you,  you’re not alone. But after numerous conversations with ChaTo, I finally  understood what was going on.  Here’s how I visualize the dynamic: imagine, if you will, a quiet pond on  a windless day. You throw a pebble at the center and watch the ripples flow  outward. Tweets propagate in much the same way across the Twittersphere.  Except that credible tweets leave a very diἀerent ripple eἀect behind them  when compared to noncredible tweets. Why? Because the ripples left behind  by noncredible tweets are encountered by Twitter users who question the  credibility of said tweets. This questioning creates some splashes along the  way, thus creating a unique ripple signature for noncredible tweets.  These  splashes  serve  another  very  important  role.  As  my  colleague  Yasuaki Sakamoto from Stevens Institute of Technology discovered in his  data-driven empirical research on how rumors spread on Twitter, “expos- ing people to criticisms can reduce their intent to spread rumors.”21 That  is, this splashing about can prevent future ripples generated by noncredible  tweets from propagating too far. In fact, Yasuaki and his colleagues found  that “exposure to criticisms increased the proportion of people who stop the  spread of rumor-tweets approximately 1.5 times [150%]. This result indi- cates that whether a receiver is exposed to rumor or criticism first makes a  diἀerence in her decision to spread the rumor.”22 So finding those rumors  as quickly as possible and tagging them with mythbuster is absolutely piv- otal. Indeed, another way of interpreting the above finding is that even if a  Twitter user sees a bunch of rumors tagged with mythbuster, this will have  little eἀect on her if she saw the rumor first before the splashing—that is, if  the first non-credible tweet she read did not have the mythbuster tag.  Building on these insights, ChaTo et al. studied over 200,000 disaster  tweets from the Chilean earthquake and identified 16 features that tend  to distinguish credible tweets from noncredible ones. For example, users    Verifying Big Data with Artificial Intelligence     149  who spread credible tweets tend to have more followers. In addition, “cred- ible tweets tend to include references to URLs which are included on the  top 10,000 most-visited domains on the Web. In general, credible tweets  tend  to  include  more  URLs,  and  are  longer  than  non  credible  tweets.”  Furthermore, credible tweets also tend to express negative feelings, while  noncredible tweets concentrate more on positive sentiments. Finally, ques- tion marks and exclamation marks tend to be associated with noncredible  tweets, as are tweets that use first- and third-person pronouns. Much of  this jives directly with the insights shared by Andy Carvin  Chapter 6 .  The  features  that  seem  to  distinguish  credible  tweets  from  noncredible  ones are listed below:     Average number of tweets posted by authors of the tweets on the   topic in past     Average number of followees of authors posting these tweets    Fraction of tweets having a positive sentiment    Fraction of tweets having a negative sentiment    Fraction  of  tweets  containing  a U RL  that  contains  most  frequent      Fraction of tweets containing a URL    Fraction of URLs pointing to a domain among top 10,000 most vis-  URL  ited ones     Fraction of tweets containing a user mention    Average length of the tweets    Fraction of tweets containing a question mark    Fraction of tweets containing an exclamation mark    Fraction of tweets containing a question or an exclamation mark    Fraction of tweets containing a “smiling” emoticon    Fraction of tweets containing a ﬁrst-person pronoun    Fraction of tweets containing a third-person pronoun    Maximum depth of the propagation trees  Using  machine  learning,  ChaTo  and  team  drew  on  the  above  list  to  develop an automatic classifier that finds credible English-language tweets  with astounding 86% accuracy. When applied to Spanish-language tweets,  the  classifier’s  accuracy  was  still  relatively  high  at  82%,  which  demon- strates the robustness of the approach.  If you read about Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response  AIDR   in Chapter 5, you may now be thinking what I’m thinking. Just like IBM    150     Digital Humanitarians   taught it’s checkers-playing program to learn the diἀerence between good  and bad moves, perhaps we could teach AIDR the diἀerence between good  and bad tweets. Indeed, what if we used AIDR to create machine learning  classifiers that automatically identify rumors for diἀerent types of disas- ters across diἀerent countries? A Wag the Dog classifier! We could per- haps start with tweets generated during major floods in Australia. For any  tweet that AIDR automatically tags as being a rumor  with a confidence  score of 90% or more , we automatically retweet  forward  that tweet and  add the hashtag mythbuster. Welcome to crowdsourced societal verifica- tion powered by artificial intelligence.23  Definitely way too snazzy for the boys over at the BBC. And yet, when  the director of the BBC’s User-Generated Content Hub is asked about the  future of journalism, he “foresees a time when the size of the BBC’s Hub  team might shrink as verification is ‘industrialized.’ By that, he means  that some procedures are likely to be carried out simultaneously at the  click  of  an  icon.  He  also  expects  that  technological  improvements  will  make the automated checking of photos more eἀective.”24 Perhaps what  some journalists don’t realize is that those automated checks will actually  be powered by artificial intelligence and in particular machine learning;  in fact, some already are. So, snazzy it is.  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BEYOND CHILE AND TWEETS At 2:49 p.m. local time on April 15, 2013, two improvised bombs exploded  near the finish line of the 117th Boston Marathon. Ambulances left the  scene  approximately  9 m inutes  later  just  as  public  health  authorities  alerted regional emergency departments of the incident. An analysis of  tweets posted within a 35-mile radius of the finish line reveals that the  word  stems  containing  explos*  and  explod*  appeared  on  Twitter  just  3  minutes  after  the  explosions.  “While  an  increase  in  messages  indicat- ing an emergency from a particular location may not make it possible to  fully ascertain the circumstances of an incident without computational or  human review, analysis of such data could help public safety officers better  understand the location or specifics of explosions or other emergencies.”25 Ambulances were already on site for the Boston Marathon. This is rarely  the case for the majority of crises, however. In those more common situa- tions, “crowdsourced information may uniquely provide extremely timely    Verifying Big Data with Artificial Intelligence     151  initial recognition of an event and specific clues as to what events may be  unfolding.”26 Of course, user-generated content is not always accurate. In  a co-authored study of the Boston bombings, my colleagues Aditi Gupta,  Hemank Lamba, and Ponnurangam Kumaraguru at Delhi’s Indraprastha’s  Institute of Information Technology collected close to 8 million unique  tweets posted by 3.7 million unique users between April 15 and 19, 2013.27  The authors found that rumors and fake content comprised 29% of the  content that went viral on Twitter, while 51% of the content constituted  generic opinions and comments. The remaining 20% relayed true infor- mation. Interestingly, approximately 75% of fake tweets were propagated  via mobile phone devices compared to true tweets, which comprised 64%  of tweets posted via mobiles.  The authors also found that many users with high social reputation and  verified accounts were responsible for spreading the bulk of the fake content  posted to Twitter. Indeed, their study shows that fake content did not travel  rapidly during the first hour after the bombing. Rumors and fake informa- tion only go viral after Twitter users with large numbers of followers start  propagating  the  fake  content.  To  this  end,  “determining  whether  some  information is true or fake, based on only factors [such as the] high number  of followers and veriﬁed accounts is not possible in the initial hours.” Aditi  and company also identified close to 32,000 new Twitter accounts  created  between April 15 and 19  that posted at least one tweet about the bomb- ings. About 20% of these new accounts were subsequently suspended by  Twitter for violating the company’s terms of service. The authors also found  that 99% of these suspended accounts did include the word Boston in their  names and usernames. In addition, they note that some of these deleted  accounts were “quite influential” during the Boston tragedy.  When  Aditi  et  al.  took  a c loser  look  at  how  the  suspended  Twitter  accounts had interacted with each other before being taken offline, they  found that these interactions produced four distinct communication pat- terns that were not common among regular Twitter users. The automatic  detection of these four patterns on Twitter may thus enable Gupta and  team to detect and counter fake content in the future. But do the findings  from the study of one incident, the Boston Marathon or the Chilean earth- quake, really apply to other major news events or crises? In other words,  are the results from this study generalizable?  In a follow-up study, “Credibility Ranking of Tweets during High Impact  Events,”  Aditi  and  Ponnurangam  “analyzed  the  credibility  of  informa- tion in tweets corresponding to fourteen high impact news events of 2011    152     Digital Humanitarians   around  the  globe.”28  The  study  examined  over  35  million  tweets  based  on trending topics at the time. From these data, the authors identified 14  major events reflected in the tweets. These included the UK riots, Libya  crisis, Virginia earthquake, and Hurricane Irene, for example. According  to their analysis, “30% of total tweets about an event contained situational  information about the event while 14% was spam.” In addition, they found  that around 17% of tweets contained situational awareness information  that was credible.  Aditi  and  Ponnurangam’s  global  findings  jive  with  those  derived  by  ChaTo and colleagues in Chile. So the team in Delhi used machine learn- ing to identify specific features that could predict the credibility of the  information shared in a tweet. They found that credible tweets had fewer  pronouns and emoticons, for example. In addition, user-based features like  the number of followers a user has and the length of the user’s username  were strong predictors of a tweet’s credibility. So Aditi and Ponnurangam  concluded that the “extraction of credible information from Twitter can  be automated with high confidence.”  Of course, rumors and disinformation do not only propagate in written  form during disasters. Fake pictures and videos also circulate across social  media,  as  we  discovered  during  Hurricane  Sandy   Chapter 6 .  So  Aditi  and colleagues at the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology  drew on their earlier findings in the hope of developing machine learn- ing classifiers that could automatically identify fake images posted during  disasters. Their eἀorts, which focused on pictures posted to Twitter during  Hurricane Sandy, met with remarkable success. The authors were able to  predict which images were fakes with an accuracy of 90%. However, Aditi  and team are quick to point out that this unusually high accuracy score is  due to “the similar nature of many tweets since a lot of tweets are retweets  of other tweets in our dataset.”  In any case, their analysis also reveals that “tweet-based features”  such  as length of tweet, number of uppercase letters, etc.  were far more accu- rate in predicting whether or not a tweeted image was fake than “user- based features”  such as number of friends, followers, etc. One feature they  did overlook, however, was gender . The group’s findings also revealed that  retweets  forwarded tweets  accounted for 86% of all tweets linking to fake  images. In addition, their results showed that 90% of these retweets were  posted by just 30 Twitter users.  In sum, Aditi and team conclude that “content and property analysis of  tweets can help us in identifying real image URLs being shared on Twitter    Verifying Big Data with Artificial Intelligence     153  with a high accuracy.” These results suggest that techniques from artificial  intelligence  can  be  used  for  information  forensics  as  applied  to  images  shared on social media.  TOWARD SOME TWEETCRED In 2014, ChaTo and I teamed up with Aditi and company to jointly develop  a credibility plug-in for Twitter. The idea was to apply findings from the  rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific research that had been carried out to  date and develop a web-based plug-in called TweetCred that can automati- cally detect noncredible tweets and fake images being shared on Twitter in  real time.29 TweetCred scores every tweet by assigning it a number rang- ing from 1  low credibility  to 7  high credibility . This score is computed  using a machine learning classifier that determines credibility of a tweet  based  on  45  distinct  features.  Naturally,  TweetCred  won’t  always  get  it  right, which is where you and the machine learning come in. You can cor- rect any of TweetCred’s credibility scores with a simple click of the mouse  to improve the algorithm. That’s all there is to it.  We’ve made TweetCred freely available because we feel it is imperative  that such tools be in the reach of the general public since a “public with  the ability to spot a hoax website, verify a tweet, detect a faked photo, and  evaluate sources of information is a more informed public. A public more  resistant to untruths and so-called rumor bombs.”30 As I’m writing this,  TweetCred has scored over 5 million tweets in just a few weeks.  We’re certainly not the only team on the quest for truth via artificial  intelligence. The Twitter lie detector project known as Pheme apparently  seeks to use machine learning alone to automatically verify online rumors  as  they  spread  across  social  networks.  In  the  meantime,  the  European  Union’s  Social  Sensor  project  is  developing  an  alethiometer   Alethia  is  Greek for “truth”  to “meter the credibility of information coming from  any  source  by  examining  the  three  Cs—Contributors,  Content,  and  Context. These seek to measure three key dimensions of credibility: the  reliability of contributors, the nature of the content, and the context in  which the information is presented. This reflects the range of consider- ations that working journalists take into account when trying to verify  social media content. Each of these will be measured by multiple metrics  based on the project’s research into the steps that journalists go through    154     Digital Humanitarians   manually.  The  results  of  [these]  steps  can  be  weighted  and  combined  [metadata] to provide a sense of credibility to guide journalists.”31  Overall, this is great news—the more groups that focus on this verifica- tion challenge, the better for those of us engaged in digital humanitar- ian response. The applied research around the alethiometer may provide  insights into how more accurate machine learning classifiers can be devel- oped. As for Pheme, it remains to be seen whether machine learning alone  will make it a success.   9  Digital Humanitarians  in the Arab Spring  “We  use  Facebook  to  schedule  our  protests,  Twitter  to  coordinate  and  YouTube  to  tell  the  world,”  said  a d igital  activist  in  Cairo  during  the  overthrow  of  former  President  Hosni  Mubarak  in  2011.1  While  many  Egyptian activists were busy toppling Mubarak, others were supporting  their “brothers and sisters” in neighboring Libya where Gaddafi was on  the run. Indeed, Egyptians donated a vast amount of food and medical  supplies to aid the revolution next door. To transport all these supplies  over, volunteers organized and coordinated their own humanitarian con- voys from major Egyptian cities into Tripoli. But these crowdsourced con- voys faced two major problems. First, volunteers needed to know where all  the diἀerent civilian trucks were and to communicate this to their Libyan  counterparts since the latter had to meet the people-powered convoy at  the border and escort them on to Tripoli. Second, because these volunteers  were headed into a war zone, their friends and family wanted to keep track  of them to make sure they were safe. The solution? IntaFeen.  CROWDSOURCING CONVOYS Inta  feen?  means  “where  are  you?”  in  Arabic,  and  IntaFeen.com  is  a  mobile check-in service like Foursquare but localized for the Arab World.2  Convoy drivers used IntaFeen to digitally check in at diἀerent stops along  the way to the border and later while en route to Tripoli. Their families  and friends back home could then keep track of their progress on a digi- tal map. These digital check-ins also enabled the activists back in Egypt   155   156     Digital Humanitarians   to coordinate the convoys and inform their Libyan counterparts accord- ingly. Some volunteers who went along with the convoys also connected  their  IntaFeen  check-ins  with  Twitter  and  Facebook,  which  meant  that  their updates would not only appear on the IntaFeen map, but also get  automatically tweeted and posted on their Facebook wall. This networked  social  media  dynamic  created  an  interesting  side  eἀect:  the  sharing  of  these updates within and across various social networks galvanized even  more Egyptians to volunteer their time and resulted in several additional  convoys to Tripoli.3  When  I met  Adel  Yousef,  the  Egyptian  software  developer  and  CEO  behind  IntaFeen,  the  following  year,  we  were  both  equally  surprised.  I hadn’t heard of his amazing eἀorts on the ground until meeting him,  and he hadn’t come across our Libya Crisis Map  Chapter 3 . Just imag- ine: the two could have had been linked from the start—combining digi- tal humanitarians with people-centered responses on the ground. In any  case, it would seem from this example that digital activists may at times  find  themselves  on  the  front  line  of  humanitarian  response,  and  when  they do, they double as digital humanitarians. The reverse is also true,  when locally based digital humanitarian volunteers finding themselves on  the front lines of mass political change, they double as digital activists.  This means that digital humanitarian activists responding to “political  earthquakes” won’t only face the twin challenges of Big Crisis Data and  Big False Data, they’ll also be confronting the Big Brother threat as well.  Disasters, after all, don’t shoot back.4 But in the process of managing these  challenges, digital activists are teaching digital humanitarians some very  important lessons.  THE MAPPING REFLEX The technologies used by digital humanitarians are typically the same ones  that digital activists use for public expression, and vice versa. Recall the  Russian Fires Help Map from Chapter 3. Our activist friends Gregory and  Alexey launched their “Help Map” after witnessing the digital humanitar- ian response to the Haiti earthquake just months earlier. But the Russian  map also became a powerful political statement, championed and sup- ported by thousands of digital activists across Russia. Crowdsourced crisis  maps can serve as powerful tools for open expression—quite literally by    Digital Humanitarians in the Arab Spring     157  placing a civil resistance movement on the map. We’ve seen this happen in  Russia, Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and beyond. Alexey describes  this new phenomenon as a “mapping reflex.5  In  fact,  when  student  activists  in  the  Sudan  began  their  protests  in  2011,  one  of  the  first  actions  they  took  was  to  launch  a public  digital  map that simultaneously displayed their pro-democracy protests along  with mounting evidence of the government’s vicious crackdown. Why?  They wanted the world to see that the Arab Spring extended south to the  Sudan. But live crisis maps don’t only serve as a broadcasting tool; they  can also synchronize shared awareness, an important catalyzing factor  of  social  movements.  As  German  sociologist  and  philosopher  Jürgen  Habermas noted in the 1960s, a group of people who take on the tools  of open expression becomes a public, and the presence of a synchronized  public increasingly constrains undemocratic rulers while expanding the  rights of that public.6  Sophisticated political maps have been around for hundreds of years.  But the maps of yesteryear, like the books of old, were created and con- trolled by the few, the elite. While history used to be written by the vic- tors, today, journalists like Anand Giridharadas from The New York Times  are asking whether crowd-driven crisis maps will become the new first  draft of history.7 In the field of geography and cartography, some refer to  this new wave of democratized mapmaking as neo-geography. But this  new  type  of  geography  is  not  only  radically  diἀerent  from  traditional  approaches because it is user-generated and far more participatory; the  fact that today’s dynamic maps can also be updated and shared in near  real time opens up an entire world of new possibilities and synchronized  responses. To be sure, having a real-time map is almost as good as having  your own helicopter. A live map provides immediate situational aware- ness,  a b ird’s-eye  view—and  thus  an  additional  perspective  on  events  unfolding in time and space.  Creating a crisis map also catalyzes conversations between activists both  online and offline, which provokes questions regarding the status quo in  a repressive environment and what to do about it. To be sure, mass media  alone does not change people’s minds. Political change is a two-step process,  with the second—social step—being where political opinions are formed.  As Clay Shirky at New York University argues, this latter step is “the step  in which the Internet in general, and social media in particular, can make  a diἀerence.”8   158     Digital Humanitarians   In  Domination  and  the  Arts  of  Resistance:  Hidden  Transcripts  pub- lished in 1990, one of my all-time favorite authors, James Scott, makes  an important distinction between what he calls public and hidden tran- scripts.9 The former describes the open, public interactions that take place  between “dominators and oppressed,” while hidden transcripts relate to  the critique of power that “goes on oἀstage” and which the power elites  cannot decode. This hidden transcript is comprised of that second step  noted above—that when the social conversations ultimately change politi- cal behavior. According to Scott, when the oppressed classes publicize this  hidden transcript, e.g., their digital crisis maps, they become conscious of  their common status. Borrowing from Habermas, the oppressed thereby  become  a p ublic,  and  more  importantly,  a s ynchronized  public,  which  constrains  undemocratic  rule.  In  many  ways,  crisis  maps  are  a v ehicle  by which the hidden transcript is collectively published and used to cre- ate shared awareness—thereby threatening to alter the balance of power  between the oppressors and oppressed. Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak would be  the first of several dictators to grow uneasy about this potential threat.  PRELUDE TO AN EGYPTIAN REVOLUTION Egypt’s  parliamentary  elections  in  November  2010  were  about  to  get  seriously intense. Mubarak was still very much in power at the time, but  Egyptian  youths  were  becoming  increasingly  vocal  about  their  griev- ances, both on- and offline. The Ministry of Interior in Egypt was well  aware of the changing winds in the political activism landscape, and in  particular had taken note of the increasing use of social media networks.  This explains why Mubarak took steps to level the social media battle- field early on and well before the parliamentary elections. On July 1, 2010,  the regime established a special department to monitor Facebook activi- ties and content, and to publish reports countering online criticism of  Mubarak and his son Gamal.  Such  was  the  political  and  social  media  context  when  my  colleague  Kamal Nabil launched a digital map to crowdsource the monitoring of the  elections, which were just a few short months away. This was by no means  a solo eἀort, though. Kamal had an entire team behind him, including  key contacts across multiple digital activism networks. At the time, Kamal  was the head of an Egyptian nongovernmental organization  NGO  called    Digital Humanitarians in the Arab Spring     159  the  Development  and  Institutionalization  Support  Center   DISC .  The  group’s  digital  map,  called  U-Shahid,  was  customized  using  the  same  Ushahidi software used in response to the Haiti earthquake  Chapter 1 .  Shahid is Arabic for “witness,” so U-Shahid was meant to convey “you  witness.” DISC’s digital mapping project became even more critical when  Mubarak suddenly barred any and all international groups from monitor- ing the upcoming elections. While Kamal had asked me to join him in  Cairo to train his team, my academic studies got in the way, so I recruited  a colleague of mine instead, who did an outstanding job preparing our  Egyptian  friends.  She  also  learned  a g reat  deal  from  Kamal  and  team,  which markedly improved our digital humanitarian response to subse- quent crises  more on that later .  On paper, the U-Shahid project was rather simple: use the digital map to  monitor the elections by allowing people to send SMS, tweets, Facebook  comments, voicemail, email, and reports via web form to the live map. The  team decided to use both “open crowdsourcing” and “bounded crowd- sourcing”  Chapter 7  to collect evidence on voting irregularities. Members  of the bounded crowdsourcing group eventually comprised more than 130  trusted Egyptian bloggers from across the country. But each needed to be  trained. And if that wasn’t challenging enough, DISC also had to get the  word out to the wider public for its open crowdsourcing strategy to work.  This meant that Kamal and team would have to carefully navigate any  possible interference by Egyptian National Security.  There  were  other  challenges.  Since  the  openly  crowdsourced  reports  would  have  to  be  verified,  the  U-Shahid  team  had  to  develop  detailed  verification strategies ahead of the election to verify their crowdsourced  reports.  The  team’s  first  step  was  to  define  concrete  criteria  for  what  types of reports would require verification. In other words, they wouldn’t  attempt  to  verify  all  the  content  that  came  their  way—they  weren’t  in  a position to battle both Big Data and Big Brother. So they prioritized  the verification of reports relating to an immediate threat or act of vio- lence, for example, and required that reports of “grave electoral fraud” be  immediately verified. If a report met U-Shahid’s criteria, the team would  then tag said report as verified if and only if one or more of the following  requirements were also met:  [The report] is supplemented by video or pictures that clearly confirms  what has been reported; It has been reported by two or more independent  sources;  Messages  coming  from  social  media   Twitter  and  Facebook     160     Digital Humanitarians   need to be confirmed by an SMS, a media report or a direct witness before  being flagged as verified; At least one of the sources of the information  must  be  clear  and  known   i.e., 2  SMSs  from  unknown  sources  cannot  verify each other .10  The U-Shahid team developed four core strategies to try and meet the  above requirements. The first involved calling or tweeting the person who  sent the report needing to be verified. This is the same strategy used by the  BBC’s User-Generated Content Hub  Chapter 7 . If the report had been  sent by SMS, DISC would call the number to verify the person’s identity  and ask if they had observed the event themselves or if they had simply  learned about the event from someone else. More specifically, details on  who did what, to whom, how, and where would be asked—a common  strategy in investigative journalism. If the event being reported was still  unfolding, the witness would be asked if anyone else nearby was able con- firm  the  information.  They  would  also  be  asked  to  provide  a v ideo  or  picture of the event—but only if it was safe to do so.  If  the  report  came  from  Twitter,  the  account  of  the  user  would  be  reviewed.  Simple  content  analysis  of  previous  tweets  and  the  account  holder’s bio would be carried out—just like we had done in Libya with the  “I’m not Gaddafi” test  Chapter 7 . In addition, DISC would also review  the Twitter user’s followers. To acquire additional information, the team  would tweet the user to ask for more details—again using the “who did  what, to whom, how, and where” format. Like Andy Carvin, formerly at  NPR, Kamal and company would also use Twitter to ask followers to con- firm unverified reports.  DISC’s second core strategy involved in-person verification via a trusted  source. The team would determine whether a member of their bounded  blogger network was close to the area referenced in a report that required  verification. If a blogger was indeed nearby, that person would be asked  to verify the report. If the team did not have any contacts in the area,  they would check whether any of their NGO partners had any staἀ in the  area. If so, those individuals would be asked to confirm the validity of the  report being investigated. U-Shahid’s third core strategy would leverage  the mainstream media for confirmation. They’d look for articles, blogs,  videos, or pictures that could confirm the information reported. Fourth  and finally, the team would seek to triangulate the report being investi- gated with the reports they had already received.   Digital Humanitarians in the Arab Spring     161  CROWDSOURCED ELECTION MONITORING RESULTS So how did Kamal and team do? Their U-Shahid  network mapped some  2,700 reports, which included 211 supporting pictures and 323 videos. The  team was also able to verify more than 90% of the content that ended up  on the map using the techniques described above.11 Most of these reports,  however, came from the bounded network of trusted bloggers, which did  not require verification. The topics most frequently addressed in reports  submitted  to  DISC’s  digital  map  included  bribes  for  buying  oἀ  votes,  police closing oἀ roads leading to polling centers, the destruction and fal- sification of election ballots, evidence of violence in specific locations, the  closing of polling centers before the official time, and blocking local elec- tion observers from entering polling centers.  What is perhaps most striking about the reports, however, are how spe- cific they are, and not only in terms of location, such as the specific GPS  coordinates of a polling center. Reports that documented the buying of  votes, for example, often included the amount paid for the vote. This fig- ure varied from 20 Egyptian pounds  about $3  to 300 Egyptian pounds   around $50 . Not surprisingly, perhaps, the price increased through the  election period, with one report citing that the bribe price at one loca- tion had gone from 40 pounds to 100 overnight. Another report submit- ted on December 5, 2010, was even more specific: “Buying out votes in  Al Manshiaya Province as following: 7:30 [a.m.] price of voter was 100  pound. . . . At 12 [p.m.] the price of voter was 250 pound, at 3 pm the price  was 200 pound, at 5 pm the price was 300 pound for half an hour, and at  6 pm the price was 30 pound.” Another report revealed “bribe fixing” by  noting that votes ranged from 100 to 150 pounds as a result of a “coali- tion between delegates to reduce the price in Ghirbal, Alexandria.” Other  reports documented nonfinancial bribes, including mobile phones, food,  gas, and even “sex stimulators,” “Viagra,” and “Tramadol tablets.”  In total, the web-based map received close to 60,000 hits, the vast major- ity of which came from within Egypt. Interestingly, the next highest num- ber originated from Saudi Arabia, with just under 5,000 hits. DISC was  also proactive in disseminating this information by printing press releases  and combining both new and traditional media for maximum impact. Its  eἀorts were featured on Egyptian television, on BBC Arabic, and in dozens  of articles in 10 diἀerent languages. Indeed, both local and global media  used the data generated by U-Shahid as part of their election coverage.   162     Digital Humanitarians   As expected, the project also got the attention of the Egyptian govern- ment. Surprisingly, however, this attention began even before the project  formally launched. Egypt’s security services contacted Kamal when the  initial idea behind the project was still being discussed. Kamal was told  that his name was recurring “too often” in phone conversations between  activists. The Egyptian Ministry of Interior subsequently shadowed the  project in diἀerent ways: by tapping the cell phones of bloggers who com- prised the core team, by requesting copies of the agendas for all meet- ings related to U-Shahid, and by requiring that a l ist of all individuals  trained on the use of the platform be submitted to them. Email addresses,  Facebook pages, and Twitter accounts of the core team were all reportedly  under surveillance from the very start of the project, and the Ministry of  Interior openly asked Kamal what his reaction would be if they were to  shut down the U-Shahid project before the elections.  Kamal and team were well aware that technology alone would not change  the political situation in Egypt. They also knew that Egypt’s national secu- rity could shut them down at any time. Furthermore, everyone involved  in the project knew full well that their involvement in U-Shahid could get  them arrested. As recent events in the United States and Syria have shown,  governments are becoming increasingly adept at developing sophisticated  surveillance techniques to monitor individuals of interest. But this did not  discourage Egyptian activists. The ability to do something different—sim- ply to have an alternative to past elections—was enough. At the end of an  U-Shahid training workshop in Cairo, one participant told the trainer:  “You know? We may all end up in jail, but before this I thought there was  no hope to change anything. Now I can even dare to think it is worth a  try.” Mubarak would fall just 3 months later.  ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF  CROWDSOURCED MONITORING The impact of the U-Shahid project on the political space in Egypt is dif- ficult to assess. According to my colleague who trained the team, more  than  1,500  election  complaints  were  officially  submitted  to  the  judicial  courts during and after the elections. But it’s unclear whether any of these  came from—or were influenced by—the crowdsourced reports mapped  on  U-Shahid. Any  overlap  between  those  2,700  reports  and  the  court’s    Digital Humanitarians in the Arab Spring     163  1,500 would certainly have highlighted the value of the project since the  crowdsourced data could be used to triangulate or bolster separate evi- dence submitted to the courts. Alas, no one I know has been able to access  the complaints received by the court.  So I interviewed Kamal along with individual members of his team to  ask what their thoughts were on U-Shahid’s impact.12 Each of them noted  that the use of the digital map had increased civic participation in elec- tion observations. DISC’s online map provided an easy and public way for  everyday Egyptians to be included by sharing what they were witnessing,  e.g., fraud, violence, etc. One of the key members of the project recounted  that “election monitoring had long become useless. . . . It was exciting in  the beginning as a way of challenging the system, being part of the public  sphere, but the government was eventually able to contain this.” In con- trast, “with Ushahidi, we had that breakthrough . . . , using Ushahidi made  full government control impossible for the government. . . . They did mon- itor our actions, but they didn’t have full control.”13  Interestingly, the trainings often focused less on the technology itself  and more on political conversations. “We generated a lot of conversations  in the training, about the politics, possible government crackdown, and  so on. People understood the risks, but what was the alternative? To sit  down and do nothing, but people were fed up and sick of [the regime], so  more people got involved. In fact, we had quite a representation during the  training, ranging from mothers to young students.”14 One Egyptian activ- ist added that “using this mapping technology provided a way to collect  and recruit a lot of activists, and not just any activists, but more eἀective  ones. This actually created a headache for the regime because a growing  number of digital activists became interested in using the U-Shahid plat- form.”15 Another activist noted that the technology acted as a “magnet”  for activists.  When I asked why the regime had not shut down the platform given  this perceived threat, one blogger explained that “many of the activists  who began using U-Shahid had many followers on Facebook and Twitter,  they also had the attention of the international media, which could cre- ate unwanted attention on the regime’s actions.” This same blogger added  that many of the activists who collaborated on the U-Shahid project were  “connected with people in the U.S. Congress, directors of international  human rights NGOs, and so on.” Furthermore, as one key person at DISC  noted,  “They  [the  government]  didn’t  quite  understand  the  technology  and were afraid of the U-Shahid platform.” Another activist confirmed    164     Digital Humanitarians   this sentiment: “the government was nervous, they didn’t feel in control.  And the government is usually behind anyways, they’re not in the driver’s  seat [when it comes to technology].”16  What may have ultimately saved the project, however, was DISC’s deci- sion early on to remain highly transparent about what it was doing and  planning  to  do  with  the  digital  map. “We  stressed  the  technical  aspect  of the project, and remained fully open and transparent about our work.  We gave Egyptian National Security a dedicated username and password  [to access the Ushahidi platform], one that we could control and moni- tor [their actions with]. This gave them a false sense of control, we could  restore anything they deleted.”17  In terms of organizational dynamics, the team was able to leverage exist- ing networks of activists and remain flexible. As an Egyptian colleague  noted when I interviewed him, the regime’s hierarchical nature made it  less eἀective in responding quickly to a changing situation, while activists  could do so in almost real time since the lines of command were far more  diἀuse than the government’s. Another activist remarked that “they [the  government] don’t understand how we work; we can learn very fast but the  government has many rules and processes, they have to write up reports,  submit them for approval, and allocate funding to acquire technology. But  for us, we don’t need permission.”18  So I asked Kamal and team whether the U-Shahid map had given them  more or less access to the political system in Egypt. One activist explained  that members of the U-Shahid project “were some of the most interviewed  people on TV, [which] gave us access to the government and the public  [their attention]; we also had a lot more access to more [political] candi- dates who wanted to have their representatives trained on the Ushahidi  platform . . . ,  and  were  also  invited  to  train  journalists. . . . We  also  got  access to other international organizations who promoted our initiative.”19  Another  activist  argued  that  the  use  of  the  digital  map  “created  more  transparency around the elections, allowing easier access than in any pre- vious election.” In fact, “in previous elections and before the existence of  Ushahidi, many NGOs made reports of election irregularities, but these  were rarely shared publicly with policy makers or even with other NGOs.  And even after the elections had taken place, it was very difficult to access  these reports. But the Ushahidi [platform] is open and online, allowing  anyone to access any of the information mapped in near real-time.”20  While activists may have felt safer organizing online than in person,  they still had several concerns. “We were afraid that the government would    Digital Humanitarians in the Arab Spring     165  be filtering reports coming to us and that they would track the reports  back to the people who sent them,” one activist noted.21 Another added  that this fear might have dissuaded more hesitant people from submit- ting evidence. The lead trainer said, “Yes, definitely, we faced some seri- ous constraints. For example, very few people sent in reports via SMS, at  most 1% of the reports we received. One reason for this was that everyone  knew that the government could track and control SMS.” A DISC team  member  noted  that  the  government  had  also  tried  to  tamper  with  the  data: “there were attempts by the government to overload our website with  many fake reports . . . but we were on it and we were able to delete them.  This happened a minute or two every three hours or so, attacks, overload,  but eventually they gave up.”22 In any event, as a precaution, DISC had a  “fully trained team in Lebanon ready to take over the project if we were  completely shut down.”23 The team also set up a phone tree in case of arrest  and made multiple copies of the platform.  In terms of influencing mainstream media, the U-Shahid team remarked  that their digital map had allowed them to get around the state’s control of  mainstream media. “People trust citizen journalism and don’t trust offi- cial newspapers or state television,” said one activist.24 Another explained  that their project’s credibility came from the realization by many that they  were simply focused on “getting the facts out without agenda. We were  both transparent and moderate, without political or party affiliation, and  we emphasized that our goal was to try and make the election process  transparent.” In sum, said another activist, “we let people decide for them- selves whether the content mapped on Ushahidi was good or not.”25  The U-Shahid map was anything but static, and the “timely compilation  of reports made a huge diἀerence. In the past, covering elections would  mean the media giving quick superficial updates, or established organiza- tions giving a comprehensive bigger picture, but only much later. With  Ushahidi, you have a little of both, the big picture and immediately. This  allowed for a more immediate impact on the electoral campaign. For the  first time in parliamentary elections, the opposition withdrew—they were  pressured by overwhelming evidence of fraud and were scared to be dele- gitimized by continuing to participate in the elections. So they pulled out  between the first and second round since a comprehensive picture [of elec- tor irregularities] was available on just the second day. Of course, this big  picture was possible not just because of Ushahidi but also because of other  observers and the media coverage.”26   166     Digital Humanitarians   As a result, both local and international media drew on the reports gen- erated by the map in their coverage of the elections. On a related note, the  U-Shahid project was able to “cover a lot more information than the tradi- tional media; while they had their own coverage, we provided more timely  information, which is very important for the media. We gave them evidence:  pictures, videos and statistics. The media doesn’t have access to all this kind  of information [by themselves], so the reports on the Ushahidi platform  were a treasure for them. Even if the government was trying to pressure the  media, the information was too valuable for them not to show it.”27  DISC’s impact was felt far and wide, and certainly beyond Egypt. By  2012,  Kamal  and  team  were  training  activists  in  Tunisia,  Syria,  Iraq,  Jordan, and Yemen on how to launch their own crisis maps.  DICTATORS VERSUS DIGITAL HUMANITARIANS Civil  disobedience  improves  crowdsourced  disaster  response   and  vice  versa . When President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines was forced from  office following widespread protests in 2001, he complained bitterly that  “the popular uprising against him was a coup de text.”28 Indeed, the mass  protests had been primarily organized via SMS. Fast-forward to Typhoon  Yolanda in 2013. Using mobile phones and social media, Filipinos crowd- sourced the disaster response eἀorts on their own without any help from  the government  Chapter 3 . Earlier, in 2010, hundreds of forest fires rav- aged Russia. Within days, volunteers based in Moscow launched their own  crowdsourced disaster relief eἀort, which was seen by many as both more  eἀective  and  visible  than  the  Kremlin’s  response   Chapter 3 .  Some  of  these volunteers were later involved in the crowdsourced digital humani- tarian response to the major floods in Krymsk. Like their Egyptian and  Filipino counterparts, many Russians have become particularly adept at  using  social  media  and  mobile  technologies  during  disasters  given  the  years of experience they have in digital activism and civil resistance.  The same is true of Iranians as witnessed during the Green Revolution  in  2009.  So  should  anyone  be  surprised  that  young,  digitally  savvy  Iranians took the lead in using social media and mobile technologies to  crowdsource relief eἀorts following the double earthquakes that struck  the country’s eastern province in 2012? And given their distrust of the    Digital Humanitarians in the Arab Spring     167  Iranian regime, should anyone be surprised that they opted to deliver the  aid directly to the disaster-aἀected communities themselves?  Iranian  journalists  launched  a F acebook  group  within  hours  of  the  quakes  to  collect  and  share  reliable  information  related  to  the  earth- quake’s impact.29 Some of these journalists also visited the disaster-struck  region to document the devastation and aid in the relief eἀorts. Existing  Facebook groups were also used to bring help to those in need. One such  group, called Female Equals Male, encouraged followers to donate blood  at centers across the country.30 An Iranian who worked at one of these  centers was taken aback by the response: “It was the first time that I have  ever seen people being so eager to donate blood. It has always been us,  pushing, advertising and asking people to do so.”31  Like their Egyptian counterparts who crowdsourced volunteer convoys  into  Tripoli  the  year  before,  young  Iranians  in  Tehran  also  organized  caravans to bring relief to victims of the earthquake. They spontaneously  organized a charity eἀort using SMS, Facebook, and phone calls to collect  money and relief supplies. “But instead of handing over their collection to  the Iranian Red Crescent Society—which is close to the government—as  the authorities had asked in the state media, these youths were determined  to transport it themselves to the most remote hill villages ravaged by the  earthquakes.”32 And so they did.  According  to  The  New  York  Times,  the  volunteers  who  responded  to  Iran’s  deadly  double  earthquake  were  “a  group  of  young  Iranians—a  mix  of  hipsters,  oἀ-road  motor  club  members  and  children  of  afflu- ent families.”33 They “felt like rebels with a cause . . . , energized by anger  over widespread accusations that Iran’s official relief organizations were  not adequately helping survivors.”34 Interestingly, Iran’s supreme leader  actually endorsed this type of private, independent delivery of aid. But  the faster citizen volunteers can respond to natural disasters, the more  backlash there may be against regimes that are not seen as responding  adequately or quickly enough to these disasters. As a result, greater num- bers of people may start to question the regime’s ability and legitimacy to  govern. Indeed, the government was heavily criticized for its perceived  failure in responding to the earthquakes. Meanwhile, these crowdsourced  humanitarian  eἀorts  often  boost  the  confidence  of  activists.  As  one  Iranian activist noted, “By organizing our own aid convoy, we showed that  we can manage ourselves. . . . We don’t need others to tell us what to do.”35 In early 2013, a magnitude 7 earthquake struck Southwest China. The  response, which was also crowdsourced by volunteers using social media    168     Digital Humanitarians   and mobile phones, actually posed a threat to the Chinese government.  “Wang Xiaochang sprang into action minutes after a deadly earthquake  jolted  this  lush  region  of  Sichuan  Province. . . . Logging  on  to  China’s  most popular social media sites, he posted requests for people to join him  in aiding the survivors. By that evening, he had fielded 480 calls.”36 Since  the government had barred unauthorized rescue vehicles from driving  the mountain roads to the disaster-aἀected areas, Wang hitchhiked his  way through with more than a dozen other volunteers. “Their ability to  coordinate—and, in some instances, outsmart a government intent on  keeping  them  away—were  enhanced  by  Sina  Weibo,  the  Twitter-like  microblog that did not exist in 2008 but now has more than 500 million  users.”37 And so, “while the military cleared roads and repaired electrical  lines, the volunteers carried food, water and tents to ruined villages and  comforted survivors of the temblor.”38 Said Wang: “The government is in  charge of the big picture stuἀ, but we’re doing the work they can’t do.”39 Meanwhile, another volunteer by the name of Li “turned to his seven  million Weibo followers and quickly organized a team of volunteers. They  traveled to the disaster zone on motorcycles, by pedicab and on foot so as  not to clog roads, soliciting donations via microblog along the way. What  he found was a government-directed relief eἀort sometimes hampered by  bureaucracy and geographic isolation. Two days after the quake, Mr. Li’s  team delivered 498 tents, 1,250 blankets and 100 tarps—all donated—to  Wuxing, where government supplies had yet to arrive. The next day, they  hiked  to  four  other  villages,  handing  out  water,  cooking  oil  and  tents.  Although  he  acknowledges  the  government’s  importance  during  such  disasters, Mr. Li contends that grass-roots activism is just as vital. ‘You  can’t ask an NGO to blow up half a mountain to clear roads and you can’t  ask an army platoon to ask a middle-aged woman whether she needs sani- tary napkins,’ he wrote in a recent post.”40  The Chinese government soon faced a “groundswell of social activism”  as a result of the earthquake and feared this would “turn into government  opposition” post-disaster. So the Communist Party tried to use the earth- quake as a “rallying cry for political solidarity. ‘The more difficult the cir- cumstance, the more we should unite under the banner of the party,’ the  state-run newspaper People’s Daily declared . . . , praising the leadership’s  response to the earthquake.”41 This did not quell the rise in digital activ- ism, however, so the government tried a diἀerent strategy. Sure enough,  the People’s Daily announced that “three volunteers had been picked to  supervise the Red Cross spending in the earthquake zone and to publish    Digital Humanitarians in the Arab Spring     169  their findings on Weibo. Yet on the ground, the government was hewing  to the old playbook. According to local residents, red propaganda banners  began appearing on highway overpasses and on town fences even before  water  and  food  arrived.  ‘Disasters  have  no  heart,  but  people  do,’  some  read. Others proclaimed: ‘Learn from the heroes who came here to help  the ones struck by disaster.’”42  Meanwhile, the Central Propaganda Department issued a directive to  Chinese  newspapers  and  websites  “forbidding  them  to  carry  any  nega- tive news, analysis or commentary about the earthquake.”43 But the cat  was already out of the bag. “Analysts say the legions of volunteers and  aid workers that descended on Sichuan threatened the government’s care- fully constructed narrative about the earthquake. Indeed, some Chinese  suspect such fears were at least partly behind official eἀorts to discourage  altruistic citizens from coming to the region.”44 The 2014 earthquake in  Yunnan, China, saw the same volunteer-driven, activist response to the  disaster, which again “marks a break from the party’s former total leader- ship in disaster relief.”45  Decades earlier in neighboring Pakistan, the government failed—cata- strophically—in its response to the devastating cyclone that struck East  Pakistan in 1970. To this day, Cyclone Bhola remains the most deadly  cyclone on record, killing some 500,000 people. A week later, the Pakistani  president acknowledged that his government had made “mistakes in its  handling of the relief eἀorts due to a lack of understanding of the mag- nitude of the disaster.”46 The lack of timely and coordinated government  response resulted in massive protests against the state, which served as an  important trigger for the war of independence that led to the creation of  Bangladesh. And to think SMS wasn’t even around then.47  Given a confluence of grievances, natural disasters may potentially pro- vide a momentary window of opportunity to catalyze democratic change.  This is perhaps more likely when those citizens responding to a disaster  in a country under repressive rule also happen to be experienced activists   and vice versa . Some individuals are digital humanitarians by day and  digital activists by night, depending on the situation. In the process, they  make new friends and develop new ties to other activists while deepen- ing existing ties—regardless of whether they’re responding to repressive  policies or natural disasters. These ties subsequently facilitate collective  action, which is key to political movements and humanitarian response— both on- and offline. While some individuals are more politically inclined,  others are more drawn to helping those in need during a disaster. Either    170     Digital Humanitarians   way, these individuals are already part of overlapping social networks. In  fact, some activists actually consider their involvement in volunteer-based  humanitarian response eἀorts an indirect form of nonviolent protest and  civil resistance.48  THE FUTURE OF DIGITAL ACTIVIST HUMANITARIANS Two  weeks  after  the  Haiti  earthquake,  then  U.S.  Secretary  of  State  Hillary Clinton gave a pivotal policy speech in Washington, D.C.49 She  began by acknowledging the critical role that communication networks  had just played in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, noting,  “The technology community has set up interactive maps to help us iden- tify needs and target resources. And on Monday, a 7-year-old girl and  two  women  were  pulled  from  the  rubble  of  a c ollapsed  supermarket  by an American search and rescue team after they sent a text message  calling for help.” While the Arab Spring wouldn’t begin in earnest for  another year, Secretary Clinton emphasized: “There are more ways to  spread more ideas to more people than at any moment in history. And  even in authoritarian countries, information networks are helping peo- ple discover new facts and making governments more accountable.” To  be sure, “By relying on mobile phones, mapping applications, and other  new tools, we can empower citizens,” she added. “So let me close by ask- ing you to remember the little girl who was pulled from the rubble on  Monday in Port-au-Prince. She’s alive, she was reunited with her fam- ily, she will have the chance to grow up because these networks took a  voice that was buried and spread it to the world. No nation, no group,  no individual should stay buried in the rubble of oppression. We cannot  stand by while people are separated from the human family by walls of  censorship. And we cannot be silent about these issues simply because  we cannot hear the cries.”  This  reminded  me  of  what  my  colleague  Anand  of  The  New  York  Times had written a few weeks later, inspired by the digital humanitar- ian response to the tragic Haiti earthquake.50 To paraphrase: They used  to say that history is written by the victors. But today, before the victors  win, if they win, there is a chance to scream out with a text message, a text  message that will not vanish, a text message that will remain immortal- ized on a map for the world to bear witness. What would we know about    Digital Humanitarians in the Arab Spring     171  what passed between Turks and Armenians, Germans and Jews, Hutus  and Tutsis, if every one of them had had the chance, before the darkness,  to declare for all time: “I was here, and this is what happened to me.”    10  Next-Generation Digital Humanitarians  The Haiti earthquake on January 12, 2010, changed my life forever. In  the early hours of the following day, I received word that my wife  girl- friend at the time  had narrowly survived a collapsing building in Port- au-Prince. The earthquake was also the genesis for many of the stories  you’ve just read. In the midst of this terrible tragedy, a powerful move- ment was born, aided by digital technologies and driven by thousands  of volunteers who cared and wanted to help; they were the first rays of  hope that signaled the rise of today’s digital humanitarians. This book  was their story. Our story. My story.  We’ve come a long way as digital humanitarians. But the road hasn’t  been easy. There have been many ups and almost as many downs. Change  does not come easy. But hope, common sense, and global goodwill are  ultimately  prevailing  despite  the  failures.  Perhaps  Winston  Churchill  sums it up best: “Success consists of going from failure to failure without  loss of enthusiasm.” But the road ahead is still long. Goodwill and inno- vative technologies alone won’t be enough to guide us through this next  leg of the journey. What next-generation digital humanitarians will need  is  enlightened  leadership  and  policy  making—the  subject  of  this  final  chapter.  A QUESTION OF POLICY Digital humanitarians who were active during the Arab Spring have much  to impart on the next wave of digital humanitarians  Chapter 9 . They pri- oritized preparedness, contingency planning, outreach, and local partners.  They developed detailed verification protocols and used both open and   173   174     Digital Humanitarians   bounded crowdsourcing techniques to collect higher-quality information.  They also solicited specific eyewitness reports from the crowd, much like  the Filipino government did after Typhoon Yolanda. Recall the govern- ment’s public advocacy eἀorts around the use of designated hashtags such  as RescuePH and ReliefPH  Chapter 3 . The government asked Filipinos  to tag their social media reports accordingly in order to make these types  of reports more easily and quickly identifiable. Hashtags act like signposts,  revealing the location of relevant “needles” across vast meadows of infor- mation.  The  government  even  has  an  official  policy  document  on  how  to use hashtags during disasters, which they recently made public.1 This  simple but powerful innovation in policy—rather than technology—cre- ated an authoritative filter for Big Crisis Data, which improved everyone’s  ability to track respective rescue and relief-related needs online.  Obviously,  the  Filipino  government  would  not  have  the  capacity  to  respond to each and every need communicated via social media—a point  it made abundantly clear from the outset. What it set out to do instead  was to create a “platform” for self-organization and self-help. How? Simply  by making the needles more visible to everyone thanks to the consistent  use  of  hashtags.  The  government  essentially  crowdsourced  the  response  eἀorts. This simple policy decision to use hashtags made the meadow of  user-generated information more legible to all, thus enabling distributed,  bottom-up responses. As such, the most powerful solution to the Big Data  challenge during disasters is a policy-based solution, not a technical one— enlightened  leadership,  not  advanced  computing,  needs  to  be  the  next  “innovation” in humanitarian technology. In fact, the degree to which we  need advanced computing solutions may reflect the degree to which lead- ership is not enlightened.  LESS COMPUTING, MORE ENLIGHTENMENT What  kinds  of  hashtags  might  governments  want  to  endorse  for  emer- gency response? Why not use the same hashtags that have been around for  decades, like 911 in the United States and 999 in the UK? When you call  911, you’re essentially tagging your verbal report as an emergency. Many  countries around the world already have diἀerent emergency numbers for  diἀerent needs. In Austria, for example, 112 is for general emergency calls.  But 122 is for fire, 133 is for police, 140 is for mountain rescue, and 144 is for    Next-Generation Digital Humanitarians     175  medical emergencies. So if I were in Vienna and happened to see a building  on fire near Karlsplatz, I might simply tweet: “133 Building on fire near  Karlsplatz.”2 This double use of the hash symbol could be used exclusively  for official reporting purposes. The fact that my 133 tweet is public also  means that my alert is communicated not only to the fire department, but  also to my followers, who can quickly spread the word, thereby leading to  distributed situational awareness and perhaps a crowdsourced response.  Sound far-fetched? Well the London Fire Brigade is looking into having  fires reported via Twitter.3  Emergency  reports  posted  on  social  media  need  to  include  location  information for them to be actionable. For example, if I had simply tweeted  “133 Building on fire,” there’s no way for the Vienna Fire Department to  know where it should deploy a fire truck. So location information is vital.  Here  too  policy  innovation  can  make  a d iἀerence.  Governments  could  encourage “data philanthropy” and promote the notion that being a “data  donor”  is  to  be  a  responsible  and  engaged  member  of  the  community.  After all, the International Committee of the Red Cross  ICRC  has long  recognized that access to information during a c risis is equally impor- tant as access to medical aid, food, water, and shelter. So if you’re going to  donate food and water to support relief eἀorts, why not also donate data?  Governments could thus create awareness-raising campaigns to encour- age data donors to geo-reference their social media reports when report- ing an emergency. All smartphones give users the ability to automatically  tag their location when tweeting, taking pictures on Instagram, or posting  videos on YouTube, for example. Governments and humanitarian organi- zations could therefore ask members of the public to temporarily switch  on this geo-tagging feature if they want to report relevant information to  responders. A simple request for data donors during a disaster would go a  long way to taming the Big Data challenge.  Naturally,  creating  demand  for  such  reports  presents  a h ost  of  chal- lenges, such as managing expectations, dealing with false information and  privacy concerns, as well as figuring out liability issues. I’ve oἀered some  potential solutions over the course of this book and have done so primarily  through the lens of advanced computing. But enlightened leadership and  forward-thinking policy making are often more important than technical  fixes alone. When the first emergency number in the world was launched  in London in 1937, some 10% of calls made to the new service were hoaxes.  The British government didn’t pull the plug on 999 as a result; it simply  sought better ways to manage the challenges that emerged, such as making    176     Digital Humanitarians   it a criminal act to report false information on 999. There’s no reason why  these laws, many of which have been around for more than a half century,  cannot be extended to new information and communication technologies.  If digital social media had been created before landline telephones, for  example, and we had laws to deal with false reports posted to social media,  wouldn’t we want to extend these laws to landline calls as well?  Of course, even the most successful public awareness campaigns don’t  change everyone’s behavior. This means that many social media users will  forget or not be aware of the official hashtags or the importance of geo- tagging their reports during disasters. The same is true for official crisis  response apps on smartphones. Their added value is first and foremost  dependent on users remembering to use them. Since disasters are excep- tions rather than the rule, many forget about the apps. This explains why  focusing on everyday communication technologies like social media and  SMS may be the way to go for nontraditional crisis reporting. So solu- tions  that  draw  on  crowd  computing  and  machine  computing—like  MicroMappers and AIDR—may continue to play an important role in the  future. In any event, apps and social media platforms ought to be consid- ered as part of the same information ecosystem. To this end, while the U.S.  Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  already has a dedicated  smartphone app to crowdsource pictures during disasters, it could also  invite eyewitnesses to post their pictures on Twitter as well by using a des- ignated hashtag. It doesn’t have to be an either–or.  While the United States only has one emergency number, 911, to crowd- source emergency calls, FEMA could specify three numbers  hashtags   that  correspond  to  police,  fire,  or  medical  emergencies,  respectively.4  For illustration purposes, fire could be designated as 933. This unique  hashtag could then be used across social media regardless of the platform.  Eyewitnesses uploading a video of a fire on YouTube would tag the video  with 933, just like others posting pictures on Instagram would also use  933, for example. The use of 933 across social media would also serve  to rapidly advertise the use of this designated hashtag, which would help  raise awareness and general adoption.  One could also envisage writing 933 on walls or on roads. Sound far- fetched? Think again. Social media is at least 2,000 years old!5 Only the  digital rendering of social media is new. I found dozens and dozens of  urgent calls for help painted or written on walls across Port-au-Prince just  days after the Haiti earthquake. Many of these analog social media reports  calling for food and water included names and phone numbers. I even saw    Next-Generation Digital Humanitarians     177  large SOS letters drawn with chalk on the rooftop of a house. Very high  resolution satellite and aerial imagery could automatically digitize some  of this analog data. The technology for “optical character recognition” has  been around for more than a half century. So when cell phone towers go  down  along  with  electricity  lines,  disaster-aἀected  communities  could  still communicate their needs with “incredibly advanced technology” like  chalk. Again, the solution here is a policy-driven solution, not a computa- tional solution. The message I want to drive home here is that the field of  digital humanitarian response is ripe for innovations in policy.  DATA FISSION TO DATA FUSION As  this  book  reveals,  the  recent  rise  in  Big  Crisis  Data  has  already  prompted the development of innovative computational solutions to help  humanitarian organizations make sense of the vast volume and velocity  of information generated during disasters. Thanks to crowd computing   Chapters 3 a nd 4  and machine computing  Chapters 5 a nd 6 , digital  humanitarians  are  increasingly  able  to  make  sense  of  Big  Crisis  Data.  Digital humanitarians are also learning from journalists and humanitar- ian practitioners about how to verify user-generated content  Chapter 7 .  Many of these verification techniques can be automated and thus scaled   Chapter 8 . As the number and variety of Big Crisis Data sources con- tinue to increase  there are currently no less than 38 distinct social media  channels , the challenge moving forward will be data fusion.  Many of us in the humanitarian community would like to think that our  problems are special and unique. This book shows these assumptions to be  incorrect. We humanitarians are not the first  or only ones  on the planet  who face the challenge of integrating multiple data sources. Nor are we the  only ones needing to visualize the fused results in a way that can support  decision making. Take my colleagues at the BBC who are tasked with veri- fying social media reports, for example  Chapter 7 . Journalists who work  with social media have already noted that “the complexity of verifying con- tent from myriad sources in various mediums and in real time is one of the  great new challenges for the profession.”6 One of the most basic strategies  used to verify social media reports is to sift through mainstream news for  corroboration. But news itself is already a Big Data headache.   178     Digital Humanitarians   The vast majority of all mainstream news articles produced today are  digital.  Even  the  smallest  of  small-town  newspapers  in  most  countries  across the world now publish their hyperlocal news online. Talk about Big   News  Data. This is where GDELT comes in.7 Masterminded by my col- league Kalev Leetaru, the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone  is the ultimate data fusion engine for all digital news articles produced  on the planet every hour of every day.8 This dataset monitors broadcast,  print, and web news media from across the world in over 100 languages.  It’s a database of what’s happening throughout the globe—a continuously  updated, computable catalog of human society compiled from the world’s  news media.9 With GDELT, Kalev has created a “catalog of human societal- scale behavior and beliefs across all countries of the world over the last two  centuries down to the city level globally.”10 Thanks to this data fusion proj- ect, the pulse of all digitally produced news  on the planet is now available  at our fingertips in the form of a single, publicly accessible database. And  that’s not all. To provide context for news events large and small, GDELT  also makes available the majority of the world’s sociocultural academic  literature published in the last half century. That’s more than 21 billion  words, covering almost every academic journal and scanning all 1.7 bil- lion documents from the open web. This addition extends GDELT beyond  the news to half a century of academic expertise and codified knowledge  about the world. In sum, GDELT gives us the ability to contextualize news  events in absolutely unprecedented ways, connecting seemingly disparate  events into a contextualized historical whole.11  Another data fusion project worth highlighting is CrisisNET, a prom- ising  new  initiative  spearheaded  by  another  colleague  of  mine,  Chris  Albon at Ushahidi. CrisisNET seeks to “dramatically reduce the amount  of  time  that  it  takes  journalists,  analysts,  and  humanitarian  organiza- tions  to  get  their  hands  on  well-structured,  crowdsourced  data  in  the  midst of conflict and disaster.”12 Chris describes his data fusion project  as “the firehose of global crisis data,” which is designed to suck in data  from a number of sources, then consolidate the data into a useful format  to  help  people  eἀectively  monitor  a c risis  situation.”13  Chris  and  team  used CrisisNET to track the conflict in Syria, for example, “pulling in  thousands of Facebook and YouTube pages, as well as information pub- lished by media and non-profit organizations to create a single stream  of  continuously  updated,  real-time  data.  These  sources  of  information  would have otherwise required hundreds of hours of manual process to  determine what was happening in Syria.”14   Next-Generation Digital Humanitarians     179  Data fusion is not a new problem, and solutions already exist to inte- grate disparate data sources such as mainstream media  both broadcast  and print  and social media reports  including multimedia content  with  satellite and aerial imagery analysis. We can already overlay mainstream  media reports of disaster damage with pictures of shelter damage posted  on social media with high-resolution imagery from UAVs and orbiting sat- ellites. Traditional humanitarian datasets along with socioeconomic and  weather-related data can also be added as overlays to this “Digital Earth.”  In sum, technical solutions often exist. The more pressing challenges relate  to coordination and preparedness. The challenge is increasingly about the  integration of these instruments. The challenges are therefore not techni- cal but relate to coordination needs and preparedness.  This  is  one  reason  for  the  Digital  Humanitarian  Network   DHN   described  in  Chapter 3.  The  network  brings  together  multiple  digital  humanitarian groups who make sense of various Big Data sources during  disasters. Being part of this network enables members to collaborate and  share data. Some DHN members like GIS Corps are particularly adept at  data fusion. The challenge is simply procedural and requires prepared- ness. Standard operating procedures are needed to ensure that disparate  data feeds observe standard data formats to facilitate the fusion process.  This explains why I often describe digital humanitarians as “information  DJs”; they pull in threads of information from diἀerent tracks across a  variety of albums to create a unique mix for a given time and place. No  one thread is perfect, of course, but the combination of interwoven sounds  presents a higher-fidelity sounding board for decision-making purposes.  The role of advanced computing here is simply to facilitate and accelerate  the ability to compare and mix diἀerent sounds. The real challenge is to  conduct this symphony of instruments in an enlightened manner.  MISSION NOT SO IMPOSSIBLE Decision makers at headquarters often ask for the impossible. I observed  this  firsthand  while  in  Manila  shortly  after  Typhoon  Yolanda.  UN  Headquarters in New York and Geneva wanted to know right away how  many people were aἀected so they could raise funds from member states  to  support  the  relief  operations.  While  the  UN  had  multiple  agencies  and personnel on the ground in some of the disaster-aἀected areas, they    180     Digital Humanitarians   obviously couldn’t be everywhere at the same time to survey the total num- ber of aἀected individuals. So they did their best to interview a number of  local village representatives. But gaining access to some of the hardest hit  areas along the coast was limited due to impassable roads that had been  replaced with mountains of debris washed up by the storm. Government  figures at the time were equally vague and often varied widely—so did  preliminary figures from other field-based humanitarian organizations.  In sum, there was a whole lot of guesswork going on during the first weeks  after Yolanda. This is not to criticize my humanitarian colleagues. You try  and count the number of disaster-aἀected peoples after a major disaster with  limited resources, time, and personnel on the ground. In any event, many of  these wild estimates may not have mattered in the end. Indeed, it seemed to  me that pressure from UN member states on the responding organizations  resulted in “ceilings” being set on the maximum level of funding that should  be requested. Such pressure can make it challenging for humanitarian orga- nizations on the ground to ask for all the funding that is really needed.  What if a more empirically driven and transparent way existed to better  assess the total number of aἀected individuals along with their resulting  needs? Member states could perhaps be swayed to donate more aid money  if the assessment process itself were more scientifically robust and self-evi- dent. Perhaps that’s wishful thinking. But the fact that the UN’s disaster  assessment process can be significantly improved is certainly not wish- ful thinking. While mainstream media coverage and social media may  only provide indirect proxies at best, satellite and aerial imagery analysis  coupled with timely analysis of mobile phone data may provide a far more  realistic figure vis-à-vis the total number of aἀected individuals.  My colleagues at the Joint Research Center  JRC  in Europe are work- ing toward 24-hour turnaround times to produce comprehensive damage  assessments from satellite and aerial imagery. What about cell phone data?  A cell phone company knows where and when each call and SMS is made  and sent. Could this “meta-data” be used to assess the number of aἀected  individuals  following  a  disaster  like  Typhoon  Yolanda?  If  my  house  or  school has been damaged and I’m forced to move to a temporary shelter,  then I should be included in the statistic of aἀected individuals. An analy- sis of my phone’s location data would clearly show that I’m no longer at  home or at school. So we could calculate this change in movement for the  entire population and perhaps get at more accurate estimates.  If  this  sounds  far-fetched,  think  again.  My  Swedish  colleagues  Linus  Bengtsson and Erik Wetter from Flowminder have been doing just that    Next-Generation Digital Humanitarians     181  in recent years.15 The team analyzed the location data of 1.9 million cell  phones  in  Haiti  before  and  after  the  devastating  2010  earthquake.  The  results  of  the  analysis  reveal  that  an  estimated  20%  of  the  population  in Port-au-Prince left the city within 3 weeks of the earthquake. These  findings were confirmed by the results of a large, expensive, and time- consuming UN survey that was subsequently carried out. Flowminder’s  analysis clearly revealed that population movements following a disaster  can be quickly and accurately calculated using cell phone data in areas  with relatively high cell phone use.  In a subsequent study, Linus and Erik found that population displace- ment immediately following the 2010 Haiti earthquake was hardly ran- dom.16  As  the  analysis  reveals,  “the  destinations  of  people  who  left  the  capital during the first three weeks after the earthquake was highly cor- related  with  their  mobility  patterns  during  normal  times,  and  specifi- cally with the locations in which people had significant social bonds, as  measured by where they spent Christmas and New Year holidays. . . . The  findings suggest that population movements during disasters may be sig- nificantly more predictable than previously thought.”  The Flowminder team carried out the above studies back in 2011 and  2012. In other words, the technology and computational know-how have  existed for years already. What is needed are enlightened leadership and  policy making to facilitate the important work that Linus and Erik are  doing.  Preparedness  is  key.  As  long  as  Flowminder  has  preestablished  partnerships  with  cell  phone  companies  like  Globe  and  Smart  in  the  Philippines,  they  can  carry  out  their  analysis  of  location  data  within  a  matter of 24 hours. The results of this analysis could be combined with  SMS reports, satellite and aerial imagery analysis, as well as mainstream  and social media analysis. All of these technologies already exist.  This new method of capturing the number of aἀected individuals is partic- ularly important since population movements following major disasters can  cause international crises, like disease outbreaks. Interestingly, Linus and Erik  were also able to capture sudden movements due to a cholera outbreak follow- ing the earthquake. They simply observed a new pattern emerge in the loca- tion data of cell phones they were analyzing. More recently, Linus and Erik  used this technique and cell phone data to monitor and predict the spread of  Ebola in West Africa in 2014. “In countries that already have epidemics [. . .]  this is the best estimate we can [give] of what mobility will look like.”17  Now  some  of  these  communication  technologies  obviously  do  get  knocked offline when major disasters like Typhoon Yolanda take out cell    182     Digital Humanitarians   phone  towers.  But  telecommunication  companies  around  the  world  are  working  hard  with  my  colleague  Kyla  Reid  at  the  Global  Association  of  Mobile Operators  GSMA  to render their infrastructure more resilient to  disasters—after all, it’s rather bad business when your customers can’t use  your service when they need it the most. On a related note, both Google and  Facebook are investing heavily in UAVs to extend Internet connectivity to  the most rural places on the planet.18 These “aerial wifi hotspots” are bound  to play an important role during major disasters. There have also been some  interesting  developments  in  “meshed  mobile  communication”  in  recent  years. The Serval Project, for example, has developed meshed communica- tion technology that enables mobile phones to talk directly to each other  without the need of a cell phone tower.19 And this innovation is not going  unnoticed  by  humanitarian  organizations.  My  colleague  Matthew  Lloyd  from the New Zealand Red Cross, for example, is working with Serval to  set up meshed communication services in the Philippines in preparation for  the next disaster. The technology already existed, and Matthew successfully  lobbied policy makers at the Red Cross to deploy this technology.  In sum, forward-thinking policies are needed to facilitate this type of  humanitarian innovation. As the author William Gibson once wrote, “The  future is already here—it’s just not evenly distributed yet.” We need bold  policies in place to facilitate and amplify the good work that innovators  like Erik, Linus, Kyla, and Matthew are doing. We also need enlightened  leadership to facilitate data sharing of cell phone data during disasters,  while at the same time ensuring that strict data privacy and protection  standards are maintained.  THE FUTURE OF DATA PRIVACY,  PROTECTION, AND ETHICS Imagine the future. An organization with access to very high resolution  satellite imagery decides to publicly crowdsource the search for military  aircraft and vehicles without disclosing the project’s purpose or the name  of the country being crowdsearched. Sound inconceivable? This already  happened in 2013.  Remember  our  colleagues  from  Tomnod  in  Chapter 4?  The  team  launched  their  military  deployment  shortly  after  DigitalGlobe   DG   bought them out. DG’s most lucrative client, by the way, is the American    Next-Generation Digital Humanitarians     183  Intelligence Community. Here were the instructions shared with volun- teers: “Exploration Challenge: Help us explore thousands of square kilo- meters of the highest resolution satellite imagery to find aircraft & military  vehicles in an urban setting.” A careful look at the imagery displayed on  the Tomnod platform suggested that the country in question was China.  But the purpose of the project remained unclear. Who would be getting  the resulting data on the location of military aircraft and vehicle? And  what would they being doing with said data?  As  one  colleague  of  mine  noted  at  the  time,  “Calling  on  the  crowd  to  produce  military  intelligence,  in  itself,  and  especially  without  any  transparency of location or purpose, is a troubling ethical breach of the  humanitarian  principles.”20  Another  colleague  added  that  China  could  use this challenge to accuse digital volunteers of participating in espio- nage. Regardless of the legal considerations around violating local laws, is  it even ethical to ask digital volunteers to participate in the collection of  military intelligence without being fully transparent?  As it turns out, Tomnod had apparently launched their military chal- lenge simply out of curiosity, not for a customer or a specific purpose. They  simply wanted to know how well untrained volunteers could identify such  features. In any event, they were up front about the faux pas they had made.  Luke Barrington from Tomnod acknowledged, “We need to do a better  job explaining the story behind our crowdsourcing campaigns.” Several  months later, Tomnod hired a full-time community manager to ensure that  they don’t repeat the same mistakes going forward.  With great power comes great responsibility. Recall from Chapter 4 that  Tomnod was able to marshal an astounding 8 million digital volunteers— equivalent  to  Austria’s  entire  population—to  crowdsearch  for  signs  of  Malaysia Flight 370. In other words, Tomnod mobilized an entire “coun- try” to search for signs of the 270 passengers. Contrast this with the UN’s  crowdsearch for Somalis who were displaced by violence and famine  also  in Chapter 4 . In that situation, 160 digital volunteers were recruited to  look for a quarter-million internally displaced persons  IDPs  in the Horn  of Africa. So you had 8 million looking for 270 lost souls in one case, and  160 looking for 250,000 in the other. This doesn’t sit well with me. Equity  in future digital crowdsearching eἀorts will require strong leadership to  ensure ethics plays a role in decision making. Otherwise, we may well end  up wishing each other “May the crowd be with you.”  Just because new technologies are new doesn’t mean that established  data protection and privacy protocols go out the window or that they can’t    184     Digital Humanitarians   be used for ill. The humanitarian community has over the decades devel- oped very clear protocols that guide how information for humanitarian  purposes  can  be  collected,  shared,  and  used.  These  have  recently  been  extended to include the role of digital humanitarian volunteers and social  media.21 The principles of “do no harm,” informed consent, opt-in, and  opt-out are more important than ever. But how do you ask 100,000 Twitter  users whether you can use their tweets to assess disaster damage for UN  relief eἀorts in the wake of a major disaster? Would tweeting a 100,000  Twitter users be considered spamming and thus a violation of Twitter’s  terms of service? Even if legally and practically possible, would tweeting  these users raise their expectations vis-à-vis the relief eἀorts?  Again, just because we’re using new technologies to support a humani- tarian eἀort doesn’t mean that there are no answers to the questions above.  The International Committee of the Red Cross  ICRC  does recognize that  asking permission to collect and use information is not always straight- forward  or  even  feasible.  “When  such  consent  cannot  be  realistically  obtained, information allowing the identification of victims or witnesses  should only be relayed in the public domain if the expected protection  outcome  clearly  outweighs  the  risks.  In  case  of  doubt,  displaying  only  aggregated data, with no individual markers, is strongly recommended.”22 While several data protection and privacy guidelines do exist, they obvi- ously cannot be enforced even if established institutions attempt to do so.  As a colleague of mine noted in an email in 2012, digital humanitarian  response is “not simply a technological shift, it is also a process of rapid  decentralization of power. With extremely low barriers to entry, many new  entrants are appearing in the fields of emergency and disaster response.  They  are  ignoring  the  traditional  hierarchies,  because  the  new  entrants  perceive that there is something that they can do which benefits others.”23  In short, it is impossible to ensure that everyone engaged in digital human- itarian eἀorts is aware of existing codes of conduct, let alone to guarantee  that everyone respects the guidelines therein. So the best we can do is raise  awareness and hold ourselves accountable to established protocols.24  OPEN DATA AND NOSHARE Just because data are publicly available  open data  doesn’t mean one should  blindly use these data, or that using these data is even ethical in the first    Next-Generation Digital Humanitarians     185  place. Perhaps what is needed is a shift in norms in terms of what is socially  acceptable and what is not. In other words, perhaps the solution here is again  not a technical one, but one based on norms. Countless computers world- wide automatically monitor and save our social media footprints around  the clock without our knowledge or consent. So we’re left with the following  choice: stay digital or excommunicate ourselves and face digital isolation  from society. I’d choose the latter were it not for the important role that  digital humanitarians can play during disasters.  So what if there were another way? An alternative that enabled us to use  social media without being fed to the machines. Imagine if the choice were  ours.25 I was pondering this question with several colleagues a while back,  and one of the ideas we came up with was the use of a noshare or ns  hashtag. We propose using this hashtag on anything that we don’t want  automatically sensed and turned in to fodder for the machines. This could  include Facebook updates, tweets, emails, SMS, postcards, cars, buildings,  roads, and even our physical selves. Buildings, for example, are increas- ingly captured by cameras on orbiting satellites and also by high-resolu- tion cameras fixed to cars used for Google Streetview.  The  noshare  hashtag  is  a humble  attempt  at  regaining  some  agency  over  the  machines—or  rather  the  corporations  and  governments  using  said machines. To this end, noshare is a social hack that seeks to make a  public statement and establish a new norm: the right to be social without  being automatically sensed or unknowingly exploited without our knowl- edge or consent. While traditional privacy may be dead, most of us know  the diἀerence between right and wrong. This may encourage positive soci- etal pressure to respect the use of noshare.  Think of ns hashtag as drawing a l ine in the sand. When you post a  public tweet and want that tweet to serve the single purpose of “read only”  by humans, then add noshare. This tag simply signals the public sphere  that  your  tweet  is  for  human  consumption  only,  and  not  to  be  used  by  machines—not for download, retweet, copying, analysis, sensing, model- ing, or prediction. Your use of noshare, regardless of the medium, repre- sents your public vote for trust and privacy, a vote for turning this hashtag  into a widespread social norm.  Obviously, ns tagged content does not mean this content should not  be made public. Content tagged with ns is meant to be public, but only  for human consumption and not for computers to automatically analyze  and store indefinitely. The point is simple: we want the option of being  our public digital selves without being automatically mined, sensed, and    186     Digital Humanitarians   scrutinized by machines without our knowledge and consent. Naturally,  one could automatically search for, collect, and analyze all tweets with the  noshare or ns hashtag. But the point here is to draw a public and norma- tive line in the sand, to create a social norm that provokes strong public  disapproval when people do violate the ns principle.  What if ns could become a social norm? What if positive social pres- sure could make it unacceptable to violate this norm? Either way, the line  between right and wrong would be rendered publicly explicit. There would  thus be no excuse: any automated analysis, sensing, copying, etc., of ns  tweets would be the result of a human decision to willingly violate the pub- lic norm. Furthermore, this social hack would make it very easy for cor- porations and governments to command their data mining algorithms to  ignore all our digital fingerprints that use the ns hashtag. Of course, this  noshare norm is not enforceable in a traditional sense. This means that  one could search for, collect, and analyze all tweets with the noshare or  ns hashtag, making it even easier for the machines. This is often referred  to as the “Streisand eἀect” whereby an attempt to hide or remove a piece  of information has the unintended eἀect of publicizing that information  more widely.26 There’s nothing we can do about this just yet. But again, the  point is to create a social norm that provokes strong public disapproval  when people violate the ns principle. Crossing the noshare line would  thus provide a basis for social action against the owners of the machines  in question. Social pressure is favorable to norm creation.  In sum, noshare is an awareness-raising initiative that seeks to edu- cate the public about our increasingly sensed environment. Indeed, Big  Data = Big  Sensing.  Sensing  is  not  bad;  sensing  of  social  media  during  disasters can save lives. But the decision about whether or not to be sensed  should be the decision of the individual. The use of ns may return a sense  of moral control to individuals, a sense of trust and local agency. If this  norm gains traction, then we may eventually be able to code this norm  into social media platforms. Could ns eventually become part of Twitter’s  terms of service?  DEMOCRATIZING HUMANITARIAN TECHNOLOGY The  UN  and  other  international  organizations  are  mainstreaming  humanitarian  technologies  by  adopting  tools  like  MicroMappers  and    Next-Generation Digital Humanitarians     187  Humanitarian OpenStreetMap’s Task Manager. These solutions make it  super simple to volunteer your time online in support of official and for- mal humanitarian eἀorts around the world. The U.S. State Department,  for  example,  is  “institutionalizing”  the  crowdsourcing  of  maps  using  OpenStreetMap in a new initiative called MapGive.27 My colleague Joshua,  who was key in launching the project, describes MapGive as an “educa- tional campaign to bring people around the world into the OpenStreetMap  community by teaching them about the importance of creating open map  data, giving them the skills to map, and helping them get connected with  mapping tasks through a user-friendly website.”28 MapGive has already  completed two crowdsourced mapping projects, one in South Sudan and  the other in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  DRC . Similarly, the  UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aἀairs is also taking  steps to mainstream and institutionally endorse the use of MicroMappers. There’s  a l ot  more  we  can  do  to  mainstream  humanitarian  technol- ogy, and thus enable more people around the world to engage in digital  humanitarian  eἀorts.  Why  is  this  democratization  important?  Because  the  more  disaster-aἀected  communities  can  use  these  technologies  to  help themselves, the more resilient they are likely to be. And as the most  comprehensive evaluation on the humanitarian response to the 2010 Haiti  earthquake notes, “Resilience is the capacity of the aἀected community to  self-organize, learn from and vigorously recover from adverse situations  stronger than it was before.”29 Timely and relevant information is key to  smart self-organization, regardless of whether you’re weathering a hur- ricane in New York or a typhoon in Manila.  So why not integrate the Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response   AIDR   platform  we  introduced  in  Chapter 6  directly  into  Twitter’s  TweetDeck  platform?  My  colleague  Ahmad  AbouAmmo  from  Twitter  was actually the one who asked me this question. TweetDeck is the most  widely used social media dashboard for managing and following Twitter  feeds. But trying to follow disaster tweets on TweetDeck during a major  disaster is near impossible. During Hurricane Sandy, for example, there  were as many as 16,000 tweets posted every minute. That said, integrat- ing AIDR or a similar solution into TweetDeck would enable all Twitter  users to immediately identify those who need help, and thus facilitate self- organized, grassroots relief eἀorts. Everyone on TweetDeck could create  and share their own machine learning classifiers on the fly. The challenges  to make this happen are hardly technical. They simply require enlightened  leadership and some forward thinking.   188     Digital Humanitarians   As also noted in Chapter 6, next-generation humanitarian technologies  are already starting to leverage both human and machine computing. The  former—human  or  crowd  computing—is  used  to  teach  machines  what  information to automatically look for on social media and on high-resolu- tion satellite or aerial images. What if this crowd computing work, which  serves to create training data for algorithms, could be distributed even  further? What if this human tagging could happen seamlessly in real time  and around the clock?  You may have seen prompts like the one in Figure 10.1 when surfing the  web. More than 100 million of these “ReCaptchas” get filled out every day  on sites like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and CNN. Google uses them to  filter out spam. How? By asking humans to type up distorted words that  computers can’t easily read. The same words are displayed to multiple users  in order to triangulate the results. This protects websites from malicious  computer programs  “bots”  that try to automatically access these sites to  create spam. But that’s not all. The words you see in the ReCaptchas like  “morning” and “overlooks” below come from a variety of sources such as  scanned copies of old The New York Times articles printed before comput- ers were around. By inserting these words into ReCaptchas, Google uses  our keystrokes to digitize the entire archive of The New York Times—that’s  more than 13 million articles dating as far back as 1851.30  What if we used ReCaptchas to support digital humanitarian eἀorts?  Instead of asking someone to type in the words they see in a ReCaptcha,  we could display pictures posted to Twitter during a disaster and ask that  someone to click on the pictures that showed disaster damage. Remember,  over 100 million ReCaptchas get filled out every day. We could develop  the world’s first spam filter for disaster response and engage companies  like Google to display these during disasters. We could even add a disas- ter ReCaptcha to the login page for emails. So every time you log in, you   FIGURE 10.1 Screenshot of a ReCaptcha.   Next-Generation Digital Humanitarians     189  simply fill out a ReCaptcha to ensure that a computer program is not try- ing to automatically guess your password and in the process support digi- tal humanitarian eἀorts around the world. Sound far-fetched?  My  team  and  I a lready  developed  a f ree  and  open-source  disaster  ReCaptcha in 2013. Yes, it already exists. The ReCaptcha is a simple, web- based plug-in that can be added to any website. This first-ever spam filter  for disaster response uses a predictive algorithm along with an existing  database of pictures to ensure that the filter cannot be gamed. So where  could we stick this spam filter? Well the UN employs some 40,000 people  around the world. So imagine if they added this disaster ReCaptcha to the  UN’s email login page. Tens of thousands of pictures could be tagged every  day as UN staἀ  log into their emails. What’s more, UN email accounts  would also be rendered more secure thanks to the ReCaptchas. Want more  pictures  tagged?  World  Vision,  the  International  Committee  of  the  Red  Cross  ICRC  and Oxfam employ some 60,000 people worldwide. Add this  to the number of UN employees and that’s 100,000 “digital humanitarians”  right there. My colleagues at the OCHA know that the disaster ReCaptcha  is ready to go and they’re game. But they need senior policy makers to give  the green light. Again, the technology and computing know-how is already  in place. All that remains is the need for enlightened leadership.  Incidentally, we could easily extend this ReCaptcha concept to mobile  phones. If you own a smartphone or tablet, how many times a day are you  keying in or swiping your password in order to unlock your device and  check your emails? We could easily insert a ReCaptcha right there.31 Of  course, this smartphone ReCaptcha would be an opt-in service only. Once  the user types in their password, they are shown a picture along with the  question: “Do you see any damage in this picture?”  GAME ON, DIGITAL HUMANITARIANS Fact: More than a half-billion people worldwide play computer and video  games for at least an hour a day. This amounts to over 3.5 billion hours per  week. In the United States alone, gamers spend over 4 million hours per  week online. The average young person will spend 10,000 hours of gaming  by the age of 21.32 These numbers are rising daily. In early 2013, the com- puter game World of Warcraft reached 9.6 million subscribers worldwide,  a population larger than Sweden. The online game League of Legends has    190     Digital Humanitarians   over 12 million unique users every day, while more than 20 million users  log on to Xbox Live daily.33  What if these gamers had been invited to search through the informa- tion  “haystack”  of  20  million  tweets  posted  during  Hurricane  Sandy?  Members of the Digital Humanitarian Network  DHN  would have taken  more than 100 hours  over 4 days  to tag the 20 million tweets, and this  assumes all DHN volunteers working 24 7 with literally no breaks. In con- trast, World of Warcraft gamers would only need 50 seconds to do this.  The 12 million gamers on League of Legends would have taken just 30 sec- onds. There is absolutely no denying that drawing on this vast untapped  resource would significantly accelerate the processing of crisis informa- tion during major disasters. Indeed, gamers worldwide can play a huge  role in supporting disaster response operations.  And they want to: gamers playing World of Warcraft raised close to $2  million in donations to support relief operations following the Japan earth- quake. They also raised another $2.3 million for victims of Superstorm  Sandy. Gamers can easily donate their time as well. This is why my col- league Peter Mosur and I launched the Internet Response League  IRL .  Peter is one of those rare avid gamers with a master’s degree in emergency  management. And since I had long been interested in tapping the power  of gamers for disaster response, we hit it oἀ right away. The purpose of  IRL is to provide gamers with the option of serving as digital humanitar- ian volunteers whenever they want. To do this, we’ve developed a free and  open-source, web-based plug-in that gaming companies can add directly  to their games. This means that gamers can stay within their gaming envi- ronment to volunteer their time as digital humanitarians.  One major gaming company that Peter and I spoke with was partic- ularly interested in using our plug-in to support humanitarian eἀorts.  The  idea  was  to  invite  gamers  to  categorize  pictures  posted  on  social  media during disasters and to reward them with points or digital cur- rency in return. Unfortunately, the gaming company in question pan- icked at the last minute. They were suddenly worried about displaying  potentially  graphic  images.  A picture  displaying  badly  injured  people  after an earthquake could be posted on Twitter and end up in a com- puter game like World of Warcraft. That being said, the vast majority of  pictures I’ve seen online following major natural disasters have not been  graphic. Of course, they’re not pleasant to look at either. Some of us may  not want to look at pictures of destroyed buildings, and we don’t have  to. Volunteering is purely opt-in and thus up to you. In addition, the    Next-Generation Digital Humanitarians     191  IRL plug-in includes a cautionary note that on rare occasions pictures  displayed via IRL may be upsetting to look at. As an aside, the pictures  you’ll find on social media after a natural disaster are typically no diἀer- ent than those you’ll find on mainstream media. In fact, the news media  increasingly  draw  on  pictures  taken  by  “the  crowd”  since  journalists  cannot be everywhere at the same time.  In any event, the irony was not lost on Peter and I given the mounting  criticisms  against  violent  online  games.  These  gory  and  brutal  games  depict the most violent scenes that imagination and graphics can pos- sibly conjure. Anyways, we went back to the drawing board and have  decided  to  use  aerial  imagery  instead  of  pictures  posted  on  social  media. As noted in Chapter 5, civilian unmanned aerial vehicles  UAVs    i.e., nonlethal drones  are already playing increasingly important roles  in disaster response. Emergency management experts thus expect that  the aerial imagery captured by UAVs will soon become a Big Data prob- lem  Chapter 6 . So could we upload aerial imagery to the IRL plug-in for  gamers to tag? This would greatly limit the ability to see graphic images  or personal identifying information. Moreover, using this imagery could  prove more of an incentive to gamers given the novelty of the medium.  How often do you get the chance to analyze UAV imagery to support  humanitarian eἀorts directly from an online computer game?  Peter and I are collaborating with a team of UAV pilots in the Philippines  to  experiment  with  this  approach  ahead  of  the  next  typhoon  season.  The results of imagery tagging via IRL could perhaps be used to create  machine learning classifiers that automatically tag features of interest in  UAV imagery  Chapter 7 . We also want to connect with gaming com- panies to explore whether displaying UAV imagery within their games  might be of interest. So if you represent a gaming company, please get in  touch. As noted earlier, we’ve already developed the plug-in. The technol- ogy is already in place. Again, what’s needed is enlightened leadership. So  Peter and I are also reaching out to gaming communities and asking them  to lobby the companies that produce their favorite games. We hope that  computer  companies  will  realize  the  immense  positive  publicity  they  could receive by becoming major vehicles for digital humanitarian eἀorts.  Gamers could really save the world.   192     Digital Humanitarians   THE SHARE ECONOMY FOR DISASTER RESPONSE Sharing could also save the world if the right policies were in place. A  recent study by the Rockefeller Foundation confirms the important role  that  social  and  community  bonds  play  during  disaster  response.34  The  analysis, which focuses on relief eἀorts following Hurricane Sandy, reveals  how disaster-aἀected communities self-organized, “with reports of many  people sharing access to power, food and water, and providing shelter.”  This mutual aid was primarily coordinated face-to-face. While in-person  support may not always be possible, the “share economy” may become  invaluable for coordinating self-help during disasters.  In a share economy, “asset owners use digital clearinghouses to capital- ize the unused capacity of things they already have, and consumers rent  from their peers rather than rent or buy from a company.”35 During disas- ters, “asset owners” can use these same digital “matchmaking platforms”  to help others in need. In New York, for example, some 1,400 kindhearted  New Yorkers used AirBnB to oἀer free housing to those rendered homeless  by Hurricane Sandy. AirBnB.com is a simple website used to rent out pri- vate rooms, houses, and entire apartments. The company vets all its mem- bers  to  ensure  they’re  trustworthy  and  immediately  identifiable  if  they  violate the company’s terms of service. In addition, renters are encouraged  to publicly review individuals they rent to, and vice versa. So members  create a public track record of their professionalism and reliability.  Just how widespread is AirBnB? Over a half-million properties in 33,000  cities and 192 countries around the world are listed on the website at any  given time. The UN Refugee Agency can only dream of having this level  of capacity one day. In any event, the matchmaking technology AirBnB  already existed when Superstorm Sandy tore through New York. What  facilitated the use of AirBnB during the hurricane was a policy decision  made overnight by AirBnB to allow its members to rent out for free. This  single policy decision has since enabled AirBnB to oἀer free housing in  subsequent disasters, like the massive flooding in the Balkans in 2014.36 In  fact, AirBnB now has a dedicated website for disaster response to promote  and facilitate self-help during disasters.37 This company is even looking to  hire a full director for global disaster relief.38  Meanwhile, on the West Coast of the U.S., the city of San Francisco  has launched a partnership with BayShare, a sharing economy advocacy  group in the Bay Area. The partnership’s goal is to “harness the power of    Next-Generation Digital Humanitarians     193  sharing to ensure the best response to future disasters in San Francisco.”39  While share economy platforms like AirBnB are still relatively new, many  experts  believe  that  “the  share  economy  is  a r eal  trend  and  not  some  small blip.”40 There are dozens of new share economy platforms sprouting  around the world enabling individuals to share a wide variety of items  that can be invaluable during disasters.  This is very good news for relief eἀorts at the grassroots level. After all,  disaster-aἀected populations have always been the real first responders.  Indeed, paid emergency response professionals cannot be everywhere at  the same time, but the crowd is always there.41 And this crowd is increas- ingly  a “ digital  crowd”  as  well,  having  recourse  to  smartphones  and  social  media  platforms.  In  other  words,  disaster-aἀected  communities  are not only the real first responders offline; they are also the first digital  responders online.  Thanks to share economy platforms like AirBnB, disaster-aἀected com- munities  can  self-organize  more  quickly  than  ever  before  since  these  new technologies drastically reduce the cost and time necessary to self- organize. And because resilience is a f unction of a community’s ability  to self-organize, these new matchmaking platforms can also render some  disaster-prone communities more resilient, thus enabling them to bounce  back more quickly after a crisis.  So I’m thrilled to see more examples of these platforms used as humani- tarian technologies, and equally heartened to know that some of the com- panies behind these tools—like AirBnB and TaskRabbit—are starting to  play a more active role during disasters, thus helping people help them- selves.42 Each of these platforms has the potential to become hyperlocal  “Match.coms” for disaster response. Facilitating this kind of mutual aid  not only builds resilience, but also shifts the burden and pressure oἀ the  shoulders of paid responders who are often overwhelmed during major  disasters. In sum, these useful everyday technologies also serve to crowd- source and democratize disaster response.  THE KIND OF WORLD I WANT TO LIVE IN The field of digital humanitarian response is still very new. We need to  move beyond anecdotal evidence of success or even mixed success toward  much stronger evidence to clearly identify what works and what doesn’t    194     Digital Humanitarians   work. So there’s much that needs to be improved. When MicroMappers  was deployed in response to Typhoon Yolanda in 2013, the microtasking  platform was nowhere close to being ready for prime time  Chapter 3 . At  most, 30% of the platform had been completed. But we launched it all the  same. Why? Because we  our UN partners included  had nothing to lose  by trying and everything to gain from giving it our best shot. Surprisingly,  the results of the deployment were somewhat mixed rather than a com- plete  failure.  But  the  necessary  fixes,  which  are  easy  to  implement,  are  hardly just technical.  Exactly how much and what type of relevant information can be cap- tured on social media are still research questions. We don’t fully know,  and nor do our humanitarian partners. So we’re figuring it out as we go  along,  together—advanced  computing  experts  partnering  directly  with  humanitarian professionals. We’re also continuing our collaboration with  UN colleagues to determine how their core information needs can be best  translated into platforms like AIDR and MicroMappers, and channeled  back to them to inform their decision-making needs. We’ve hardly begun  to answer the vast majority of questions out there. So who knows where  the field of digital humanitarian response will go from here.  But several trends are becoming increasingly apparent. And I’m particu- larly interested in two of these trends. The first is the rise of “worldwide  goodwill,” and the second is the rise of “digital villages.” In 2010, my col- league Clay Shirky published a book entitled Cognitive Surplus: Creativity  and Generosity in a Connected Age.43 By way of numerous examples, Clay  shows that we’ve come a long way in how we use our free time. Today, the  billions of hours of free time that exist on this planet every day is increas- ingly used to create rather than simply to consume. This is largely thanks  to new digital technologies that facilitate new forms of collaboration. Take  Wikipedia, for example. The crowdsourced digital encyclopedia is the result  of more than 100 million hours of creation. In the past, these 100 million  hours may well have gone into passively consuming television shows instead.  Clay points to the digital humanitarian eἀorts in response to the 2010 Haiti  earthquake as an example of creativity driven by generosity.  As the many stories woven through this book have shown, the response to  the Haiti earthquake was but the first milestone for digital humanitarians  around the world. These stories reveal that worldwide goodwill exists. People  care. This is good! Until recently, when disasters struck in faraway lands, we  would watch the news on television wishing we could somehow help. That  private wish—that innate human emotion—would perhaps translate into    Next-Generation Digital Humanitarians     195  a donation. But that would never feel like enough. Today, not only can you  donate cash to support those aἀected by disasters, but you can also donate a  few minutes of your time to support the relief eἀorts on the ground thanks  to  new  humanitarian  technologies  and  platforms.44  In  other  words,  you,  me, all of us can now translate our private wishes into direct, online public  action, which can support those working in disaster-aἀected areas.  From the Haiti earthquake on, I’ve had the privilege of witnessing this  surge of worldwide goodwill firsthand, literally. People care; they want to  oἀer their time to help others thousands of miles away. The global village  of digital good Samaritans is growing. This is beautiful and the kind of  world I want to live in. To paraphrase the philosopher Hannah Arendt, the  greatest harm in the world is caused not by evil, but apathy. So we should  cherish the digital goodwill that springs during disasters.  As I write these final pages, Category 5 Typhoon Ruby is on a collision  course with the Philippines. The Digital Humanitarian Network  DHN  is  on full alert. At the same time, the World Health Organization has activated  the DHN in response to the tragic and preventable Ebola outbreak in West  Africa. The Standby Task Force has taken the lead in creating the most com- prehensive maps available of health clinics across Sierra Leone, Liberia, and  Guinea. Meanwhile, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team is doing what  it does best: Creating high-resolution maps of rural, aἀected areas using sat- ellite imagery. And the DHN is now collaborating directly with the official  United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response  UNMEER . Yet  again, Digital Humanitarians are on the front lines of another major crisis,  providing  traditional  humanitarian  organizations  with  the  critical  surge  capacity they need to make sense of the rapidly evolving situation.45  At the same time, this goodwill, this precious human emotion and the  precious time it freely oἀers, can easily be abused. Digital humanitarian  projects  during  disasters  do  not  always  follow  established  humanitar- ian principles; some ignore basic protocols on data privacy and security  outright. And many initiatives end up crowdsourcing information that is  never used. Still others ask volunteers for an impossible amount of time to  carry out very tedious and exhausting work. Needless to say, none of this  constitutes a good use of human time.  We’re no longer in 2010 responding reactively to the Haiti earthquake.  New digital humanitarian projects should be demand driven—either by  the information needs of humanitarian organizations on the ground, or by  the needs of disaster-aἀected communities themselves. Next-generation  humanitarian  technologies  like  the  Artificial  Intelligence  for  Disaster    196     Digital Humanitarians   Response  AIDR  platform should be at the service of digital humanitar- ian  volunteers  so  they  can  make  sense  of  Big  Crisis  Data  without  hav- ing  to  burn  themselves  out  and  potentially  fail  in  the  process.  But  the  technologies themselves—like AIDR and MicroMappers—are ultimately  less  important  than  the  underlying  methodologies  that  they  draw  on— methodologies drawn from advanced computing, like microtasking and  machine learning. So we should really be championing the use of tech- niques from advanced computing in order to make the most appropriate  use of precious human time.  The right to receive and give humanitarian assistance is a basic human  right. At times, however, well-meaning Samaritans end up causing more  harm  than  good.  We  see  this  during  disasters  when  “disaster  tourists”  flock to aἀected areas wanting to help. Unfortunately, their goodwill can  have the opposite eἀect, especially if they’re inexperienced. This is also  true of digital humanitarians, however. The spring of global goodwill that  exists following disasters can all too easily turn into a destructive flood if  not channeled responsibly.46  Now, this doesn’t mean that we, the formal  digital  humanitarian com- munity, have figured it all out—far from it. This simply means that we’ve  learned  a few  important  and  difficult  lessons  along  the  way.  So  unlike  newcomers to the digital humanitarian space, we have the benefit of sev- eral years of hard experience to draw on when deploying for disasters like  Typhoon Yolanda. While sharing the lessons we’ve learned and dissem- inating them as widely as possible is obviously a must, it is simply not  good enough. Guidebooks and guidelines just won’t cut it. We also need to  operationally channel the global spring of digital goodwill and distribute it  sensibly to avoid destructive “flash floods.”  So  what  might  these  goodwill  channels  look  like?  Well,  they  already  exist  in  the  form  of  next-generation  humanitarian  technologies  like  MicroMappers and Humanitarian OpenStreetMap’s Task Manager. While  the  MicroMappers  deployment  following  Yolanda  was  certainly  far  from  perfect, we were still able to channel about 250 hours of goodwill—10 full  days—in just 72 hours, 10 days of volunteering that supported official dam- age  assessment  eἀorts  and  which  did  not  cause  harm.  These  many  free  hours of goodwill came from hundreds of volunteers in dozens of countries  around the world and from all ages and walks of life. And all this goodwill  was channeled directly to our UN partners on the ground in the Philippines,  enabling them to make sense of all the tweets and pictures generated follow- ing Typhoon Yolanda. This is the kind of world I want to live in.   Next-Generation Digital Humanitarians     197  New humanitarian technologies can create the channels that focus digi- tal goodwill in support of the humanitarian organizations that physically  deploy to disasters. These channels operate using best practices, codes of  conduct, protocols, etc., and can be held accountable. We need more dem- ocratic humanitarian technologies like these to channel the huge surplus  global goodwill that continues to grow online.  The second trend that has come into focus for me in recent years is the  rise of local digital villages. I often say that crowdsourcing is just a new  word for the old African saying that “it takes a village to raise a child.”  Sometimes, it takes a local digital village to support humanitarian eἀorts  on  the  ground  rather  than  global  goodwill.  I w as  struck  by  the  very  large number of local digital humanitarians mobilizing online following  Typhoon Yolanda, for example. These digitally savvy Filipinos were rapidly  self-organizing and launching crisis maps well before any of us outside the  Philippines had time to blink. I’ve seen this happen across literally dozens  of disasters since the 2010 Haiti earthquake. I wish I had enough space left  in this book to include a few pages on each, like the locally driven digital  humanitarian response to the recent tsunami in Japan and the eruption of  Mount Merapi in Indonesia.47 But you can join me on my iRevolution.net  blog to share your related stories and discover how local digital villages  are changing humanitarian response around the world. In any event, this  is a new phenomenon—not self-organization and mutual aid, of course,  but rather self-organization and mutual aid powered and augmented by  digital technologies and advanced computing.  This rise in the number of local digital villages may mean that humanitar- ian operations will become less about the formal brick-and-mortar humani- tarian organizations, and also less about the Digital Humanitarian Network.  After all, disaster response is and has always been about local communities  self-organizing. Today, local digital communities are also self-organizing  faster, better, and stronger. This capacity for self-organization is important  for disaster response and resilience. Indeed, the majority of lives saved dur- ing disasters can be attributed to this local agency, not international, external  relief.48 Furthermore, these local digital villages are increasingly the source  of humanitarian innovation, so we should pay close attention; we have a lot  to learn from them, just as they have much to learn from our experience.  So in a world that often seems riddled with negative uses of technolo- gies, it is inspiring and perhaps even heartwarming to see so many digital  volunteers from all walks of life, all ages, nationalities, and creeds, come  together online to support relief eἀorts both close to home and on the    198     Digital Humanitarians   other side of the planet. This is the kind of world I want to live in. This  is  how  Big  Data  is  changing  the  face  of  disaster  response.  By  enabling  the rise of digital humanitarians. The faces you see on the cover of this  book are just some of the many digital humanitarian volunteers who are  changing the face of disaster response. So if you’ve read this far, then you’ll  understand why the title of this book should probably have been Digital  Humanitarians: How Big Data and Big Hearts Are Changing the Face of  Humanitarian Response.   Endnotes  CHAPTER 1    1.  The first person I called to launch the crisis map was David Kobia, the lead soft- ware developer at Ushahidi. At the time, only a software developer could set up an  Ushahidi map online since doing so required programming skills. So I called David  on his cell phone. I told him about the earthquake and asked if he could set up a map  that I could customize for the Haiti earthquake. He kindly agreed.  2. I was working with Ushahidi at the time as Director of Crisis Mapping. I was at The   Fletcher School because I was also completing my PhD.  3.  Meier, P. 2010. Haiti and the Power of Crowdsourcing.

Others claimed that Libyan volunteers with the  SBTF quit the project after the map was made public. This too is false. The SBTF was  only a few months old at the time and did not have any Libyan volunteers when the  crisis map was launched. The same misinformed sources also claimed that the SBTF  servers crashed and that bugs in Ushahidi software powering the crisis map presented  serious problems. Again, this is false. The lead SBTF volunteer in charge of technical  support at the time was a highly experienced computing and data security expert. The  public crisis map was completely disconnected from the private, password protected  map, which was never shared online. To this end, even if the public map had a bug,  there was still no way to track any data back to the private map.    18.  This is particularly true for sudden-onset disasters that prompt the need for immedi- ate responses. But the data collected in near real time during crises can obviously still  be used years later for other assessments.    19.

I realize that bagging has a special meaning in machine learning; so apologies to all  computer scientists who may take issue with my use of the word bagging here. I am  simply trying to render a rather technical explanation more accessible to noncom- puter scientists so they can better understand the general principles at work here. I  am thus using bagging in the more general sense of the word to convey the picture  of adding tweets to a physical bag. If you can think of a better analogy or metaphor,  then please let me know!    20.  Purohit, H., Casillo, C., Diaz, F., and P. Meier. 2014.

As my colleague Sanjana Hattotuwa commented when reading a close-to-final draft  of my manuscript, it is also important to flag the erosion of and radical redefinitions  of  privacy  in our  digital  age.  “The  transparency  and  real-time  location  awareness  desirable and generated in the aftermath of a disaster is harmful over the long term”  at that same level of transparency and resolution. “How and when does this transition  occur, and why whom is the decision made to safeguard those who may be at risk  over the long term by sharing their needs for relief and aid?”    25.

The fact that governments are mainstreaming crowdsourcing may be cause  for concern, of course. During Iran’s 2009 “Green Revolution”, the regime in Tehran  crowdsourced the tagging of profile pictures in order to track down activists.    28.  DipNote.  2014.

About the Author  Patrick Meier, PhD, is an inter- nationally recognized trailblazer  in the application of new technol- ogies for humanitarian response.  He  has  more  than  a d ecade  of  professional  experience  in  humanitarian  technology  and  innovation,  and  his  influential  blog  on  this  topic   iRevolution   has received over 1.5 million hits.  Together with the United Nations, he co-founded the Digital Humanitarian  Network, which has been described as one of the most important innovations  in the humanitarian space in the last decade. Dr. Meier collaborates directly  with leading humanitarian organizations around the world to accelerate their  relief eἀorts during major disasters. How? He leverages innovative Big Data  solutions to make sense of social media, satellite imagery, and even aerial  imagery captured by civilian drones unmanned aerial vehicle  UAVs  during  disasters. In 2010, President Bill Clinton publicly praised Dr. Meier for his  digital humanitarian eἀorts. Given his unique expertise, Dr. Meier is often  interviewed by the media, including The New York Times, The Washington  Post,  The  Wall  Street  Journal,  Forbes,  BBC,  CNN,  The  Economist,  UK  Guardian, NPR, PBS, Newsweek, Foreign Policy, Huffington Post, Wired, MIT  Technology Review, Slate, Fast Company, Mashable, Nature, New Scientist,  and Scientific American. He is also a sought-out public speaker, having given  talks at the White House, United Nations, World Bank, Google, Harvard,  Stanford, and MIT. In addition, he has given talks and keynotes at major  international conferences and has spoken at five TEDx events. Dr. Meier is  also a UNICEF Humanitarian Innovations fellow, a Rockefeller Foundation  and PopTech fellow, a fellow at the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative  HHI ,  and a National Geographic emergency explorer. He currently serves as direc- tor of social innovation at the Qatar Computing Research Institute  QCRI   and holds a PhD from The Fletcher School at Tufts University, a predoctoral  fellowship from Stanford, and an MA from Columbia University. Dr. Meier  was born and raised in Africa and tweets at @patrickmeier.  221    Advanced Computing and Crisis Management  This book charts the spectacular rise of Digital Humanitarians, highlighting how their humanity  coupled with Big Data solutions is changing humanitarian response forever.   Praise for the book:  “Patrick Meier is a passionate evangelist for the power of Big Data to help us respond to natural disasters  and other crises. He is also a careful scholar who thinks deeply about the limits and potential dangers of  data-centric approaches. His book offers both inspiration for those around the world who want to improve  disaster response and a set of fertile challenges to ensure we use data wisely and ethically.”  —Ethan Zuckerman, MIT Center for Civic Media “I dare you to read this book and not have both your heart and mind opened. Patrick Meier writes  compellingly about his firsthand accounts of people around the world working together to help disaster  victims through advanced computing solutions.”   —Leisya Palen, University of Colorado at Boulder “Working from examples like the Haitian earthquake and the Arab Spring, Meier shows how tools from  artificial intelligence to aerial drones, and techniques from crowdmapping to distributed fact-checking, are  helping to dispel the ‘fog of war’ that afflicts crisis response.”  —Clay Shirky, New York University  “An insider’s guide to the humanitarian data revolution, seen through the eyes of a thought leader, scholar, and  expert practitioner on the front lines of a global movement that is already transforming how we understand and  respond to crises.”  —Robert Kirkpatrick, United Nations Global Pulse  “Business, economics, and governance are transforming as traditional state-based institutions are supplemented  and indeed eclipsed by non-state networks of civil society. New technologies are enabling regular citizens  to connect, collaborate, and save lives. In his book, Meier shows these same trends emerging in the field of  humanitarian response. Global problem solving is rapidly evolving and Meier will help get you on board.”  —Don Tapscott, Global Solutions Network and co-author of Wikinomics “This book breaks new ground, as Patrick Meier charts the optimism, the possibilities, and the dilemmas of a  new Digital Humanitarianism from his own firsthand experience. For anyone in the humanitarian sector— ignore this book at your peril.”   —Tarun Sarwal, International Committee of the Red Cross  ICRC   Cover design by Andrea Verity  K23671  ISBN: 978-1-4822-4839-5 90000  9 781482 248395  D  I  G  I T A L      H U M A N  I T A R  I  A N S
