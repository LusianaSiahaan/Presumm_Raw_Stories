Scorned  might  be  the  wrong  word  choice  here,  since  it  was  I  who  invited the Homeland Security agents into my home .  "Come on in, the water's warm," I told them . They  strolled  in  like  vampires.  It  felt  a  little  queasy  to  walk  behind them, like today was some kind of initiation day or something and I was the fresh  white  meat  of  the  month.  I  also  noticed  one  of  them   the  female  humming softly as she came in. Some death row harmonica tune as I recall. The one from Shawshank Redemption. Or was it The Green Mile ?  To  be  honest  neither  resembled  Mulder  or  Scully  like  I  thought  they would   nor  had  a  gun  that  I  could  see ,  but  it  didn’t  really  matter.  Both agents sounded professional; suited up and as stone-faced as any statue on Easter Isle with little in the way of humor or human warmth that could be discerned. Automatons dressed to kill. In fact, the male agent looked every bit  the  consummate  professional  hitman  Alberto  the  Shadow  was  in Scarface. You didn't turn your back on a guy like that .  Yet here I was contemplating asking them to leave after only inviting them in a nanosecond ago. Wasn't happening. Worse was the whiff of air my nostrils caught scent of as they passed me. It was the scent of something dead. Or maybe just the last guy that asked them to leave .  As  I  poured  a  drink  I  asked  myself,  were  they  real  agents?  I  couldn't tell. I suppose I should have asked for ID but I was still feeling jet-lagged from the Rio trip. With two days to go before Mardi Gras, I'd raced home from the New Orleans airport to get some sleep so I could meet my brother   to fast-paint an Endymion parade float at mom's house. Only this time I'd be late. Terribly late. Because vampires .  A fitting end I suppose, since my brother Stephen and I have PhDs in lateness. Like clockwork I had waited until the 11th hour to do what Mom tasked  us  with:  paint  the  Endymion  float  fast  and  neat  and  all  cool  like something  out  of  Willy  Wonka.  Only  fast  and  neat  where  we  were concerned was like asking the Marx brothers to do a rush job on a Mona Lisa  forgery.  I  could  paint  well  enough,  but  my  brother,  like  Groucho, painted single-handedly with one hand holding a joint as the other brushed. Hustling was his specialty, not painting. He hustled everything. Even me .  He'd often give me a list of places where his friends lay in wait along Veterans Blvd near New Orleans, friends who dressed the part but none of whom were actually veterans. The mission? Bomb them with the best booty and beads when our float came around. Only knowing my brother like I do, he'd brag down at Igor's bar long and loud like some train in the night and take all the credit. I'd get nothing .  The man never gave credit for squat unless he was in trouble with the law. Even as far back as sixth grade, he'd scoff whenever I said to knock off the  bar  bragging  in  the  school  yard.  It  never  helped.  Sooner  or  later,  I warned, a shark would come along and sink a mouthful of teeth into those lying teeth of his .  Then  one  scorcher  of  a  day  in  August   middle  school,  as  I  recall ,  a thresher shark showed up when he caught the attention of the local police. It seemed one freckled boy told every other boy in the school yard that my brother had bragged he owned a shed containing every automatic weapon imaginable,  even   I  kid  you  not   a  suitcase  nuke  straight  out  of  Fallout. They all bought this lie, of course, only one of the ugly kids he'd teased had ratted him out. Shocker, right? Next thing you know our puritan principal summoned him and the cops and when the boys in blue arrived, they cuffed him like he'd pinched every girl's pink bum in the yard .  I sat there mumbling and trembling in Ms. Needles math class thinking I was next on the hit list. Had I overheard the words 'search warrant'? And that odd scent that one of the cops dragged with her. A dead animal? No not quite. It reeked of a dead human .  Truth be told I was more worried about my secret stash. They'd steal my porn stash and take Suzanne Somers away from me forever, I was sure of it. Asses would sting  mine  and if not by Dad than surely that sharkey cop   with  the  razor-thin  mustache  whose  last  name  sounded  an  awful  lot  like 'thresher '.  But my brother didn't rat. They suspended him and Dad hit the roof, but he didn't rat. Turned out that my father pulled some strings to keep him out of jail. The lucky loser .  Fast forward to now, in my living room, and that same shark cop from sixth grade eying me in perfect dark; her eyes filled with wet Texas crude looking  to  bury  a  dinosaur  like  me.  She'd  no  doubt  had  eaten  a  few dinosaurs by now, slit a few throats on the way to the top, and now here she was staring me down like I was a fresh-born kitten meant for the Coyote grill. Come on in, the water's warm, I'd said. Stupid .  Speaking of, my brother was in trouble again. A deep sea of trouble . It  seemed  that  he  had  targeted  hidden  Tor  sites  scattered  around  the Darknet, playing his usual lame pranks, when in one instance he took it too far. The two agents came because, well, Stephen just didn't know when to leave on a high note. He had told two undercover agents that he owned an underground storage bunker full of illegals that he sold off as sex slaves for a grand a pop. A side hustle, he called it. I knew this to be a prank, but they did not. How could they ?  Only now the very shark I'd warned him about had come back to bite me . Oh irony. Teaching Tor when he didn't understand the risks posed by Google and all other social media tyrants was a colossal blunder of biblical proportions  on  my  part.  A  terrible  mistake  and  one  I'd  not  likely  recover from. It was like handing Frodo's Ring of Power to one of those guys down at the Bayou Swamp Tour that stick their heads into the mouths of crocs for a few dollars more. A lot of fat good it'd do .  Oh and he had used a cell phone. Brilliant, right ? It hadn't been hard to track the goober down. Google had helped them connect-the-dots. Now they were here for a side of beef off my backside, the only question being which side .  So I escorted the agents into my kitchen expecting to be butchered by my own knives. I politely I offered them a beer or a Coke or a steak. Hell even  a  three  month  old  Twinkie,  which  they  declined.  I  huffed  and  then straddled  a  bar  stool  and  invited  them  to  do  the  same.  Once  again  they declined. They could not be bought, bribed or bamboozled for any price .  "This  won't  take  long,"  the  male  agent  said.  It's  what  all  agents  said, everywhere. Even the census taker has said the same a year prior and as I   arms .  recall it'd taken forever and a day. The next words he said cut like dry ice .  "We take every threat to this nation seriously, Lance. Your brother has made  some  serious  threats,"  said  the  taller  agent  as  he  crossed  his  bulky arms. "He's in our custody now but whether he stays there depends on you. In this very instant ."  Custody? I didn't believe him. "Do tell," I said as I folded my skinny  "We'd like to see your phone ." My heart stopped as all color drained from my face, all monochrome . "Ahem. Right now," added the female agent. It was then that I asked for  ID. They showed it but it was too late. They were in like Flynn .  "Prostitution  rings  carry  a  hefty  sentence  as  does  issuing  threats  to federal  law  enforcement  officers,"  the  agent  began  to  say,  "...  and  even dumping manure on our department's front lawn ."  He  glanced  around  the  kitchen,  running  his  hand  along  the  granite  countertop .  "Asset forfeiture is a big industry these days." He knocked on granite . No shit, I thought. Asset forfeiture, courtesy of the ATF and DEA, had been  a  very  profitable  industry  for  eons  and  all  the  more  for  the  US government. I'd known guys with small basement grow-ops that lost their homes and land to the Feds both in Canada and the States. I took nothing for granted where those guys were concerned .  But  I  knew  not  to  talk  without  a  lawyer  present...  except  I'd  already invited them in and like true vampires it became apparent that they weren't keen on leaving without the item they came for. Why oh why me. With my voice quaking I let out a little protest that ended up sounding more like a mew instead of a roar. A cat going to the vet .  "I'm not giving you my phone," I squeaked. "I don't care what kooky  story my idiot brother told you ."  "Excuse me?" the lady asked. She giggled at this, a giggle that sounded like a cat chewing up a squishy mouse or toothpaste squeezed out of a tube. "You cannot win against the federal government. Hand it over ."  "Hand what over ?" "THE PHONE ." " Oh, that. Err... No ." "No? Why not?" she asked .   I stabbed a finger at her just as I raised my voice. "Either make an arrest or leave! I'll not be bullied into submission without a warrant by a couple of federal thugs named Frick and Frack. My phone is encrypted so it'll do you no good anyway. But I've got a landline here and my lawyer on retainer so let me just call him up and get a recording going ."  They both looked at each other. "We'll be back," the man said. As they closed the door I heard the lock slide into place like a jail cell slamming home. My cell phone was about to become my jail cell. Had I hammered the last nail into my own coffin ?  Furiously I sped over to my brother's house, so fast I nearly hit a dog peeing on a fire hydrant and didn't stop to look back. I was livid. Beyond livid. I had no clue if Agent Frick would be back, warrant in one hand and a noose  in  the  other,  but  I'd  be  damned  if  I  was  going  to  swing  from  the nearest tree without knowing what stupid thing my brother'd done to bring on this level of heat .  I found him parked outside his spooky old house in that fire-engine red truck I'd hated for years, AC-DC blaring Back in Black. He was twirling his pornstache, no worry in the world about his fate or mine. Typical. I wanted to smack him. Hard. Right upside his head the way Rick James did to a few tag-a-longs back in the 80s. But I stopped when I saw Facebook front and center. Not only that abomination  but  Twitter,  Google  Plus,  Skype,  Viber and Whatsapp, with Tor running in the background .  Tor! Sweet lawd almighty . I grit my teeth and shouted "DUMMY!" into his ear and watched as his phone fell into his Bud Light glass under the hot pink fuzzy dice. He cursed me out .  "Azzzzhole,"  he  yelled.  He  wiped  it  off,  waterproof.  Gangly  and unshaven, he talked like that skinny gyro captain loser from Road Warrior who  believed  in  the  concept  of  shared  wealth  -  as  long  as  it  belonged  to someone else and was his for the taking .  "Couple of goons hassled me today," he mumbled. "Same here... brother ." I replied. "Somethin' about you making threats? And... a manure dump on a federal building's front lawn ?"  After a long sigh, a belch and a few coarse threats I finally dragged the intel out of him. How he'd not only issued threats over Tor but that he'd put in  an  order  for  a  dump  truck  to  pile  a  ton  of  manure  on  the  FBI  and Homeland Security's front lawn using a credit card over Tor. My credit card.   He pulled it from his wallet and frisbeed it into my face with the stupidest comment I'd ever heard .  "Tor didn't work with your card. You ain't paid up or somethin '?" It was here that I went dark on him . I  pulled  the  knuckle-dragger  out  and  inside  the  house  kicking  and screaming before letting loose with every curse I knew. He flailed like the swordfish we caught in the Gulf of Mexico, fins everywhere like a crazy person, swinging and sweating and stabbing .  When we finally simmered down I noticed the state of his living room. The  place  was  ransacked  more  than  usual.  Beer  cans  piled  high  with  a vacant space where the PC had been lie visible. Three guesses as to who took it. The FBI had come and let it slide but apparently they had friends in Homeland who needed a fresh piece of meat. Two slabs actually, order up . When I pressed him on it he replied that Homeland carted it away while powered on using a portable power source of some kind. I knew about such things, but did he? Nope. This is the Gyro Captain guy. The fool who liked to say ‘Don’t play me the fool!’ guy .  He tried to get up so I shoved him back down and yelled, "You stay in  that spot and don't you move a muscle until I'm finished !"  I threw everything I'd said the week prior into his face again  opsec stuff mostly , and swore I'd take mom's house back in a New York minute if he didn't  listen  this  time.  It  wasn't  enough  that  his  ass  and  ego  stung.  He needed a lobotomy .  "You're  good  at  that  nekkid  Tor  stuff.  I  ain't!  'Sides,  you  talk  too  fast  how in hell can I keep up with that technical mojo ?"  He was right. I always talked too fast even back in sixth grade and on a few  sweaty  occasions  I  could  swear  that  I  could  literally  see  my  words flying over and around his uncombed head; like if you shined a flashlight through  those  ears  you'd  see  his  eyes  flash.  So  I  went  slow.  Turtle  slow. Talking  with  my  hands  like  some  Italian  piano  player  before  a  grand performance .  "Look," I began. "If you're going to play the Riddler and prank alphabet agencies then the absolute least you can do is to muck it all up in your own name and do so with some residue of competence. It's embarrassing when my name comes into it. Why'd you use my card for it? Why bring me into it at all ?"  Nothing but deadbeat excuses came back .   My  voice  went  as  low  and  deadly  serious  as  a  neurosurgeon  when discussing  a  terminal  patient.  I  wanted  to  take  a  red  hot  searing  iron  of opsec rules to his butt cheeks but knowing him he'd forget they were there. So  instead  I  decided  what  he  needed  was  a  foundation  of  the  basics,  the why,  the  wherewithal,  the  way,  the  whole  enchilada  when  it  came  to  cell phones and anonymity. Why we do this instead of that and what happens if we don't .  "Why?" he'd ask . "Because  guys  who  never  sweat  the  small  stuff  as  long  as  the  power  button is greenlit get burned, that's why ."  Then along comes some taffer with a badge and a gruff voice who hits him with one small threat and then another and another, and all in a friendly 'knock and talk' and at that point he might as well slap the cuffs on himself. He  doesn't  see  the  overall  context,  the  trap  being  set,  and  ends  up  like Gulliver with the Lilliputians, pinned to the ground by a million tiny threads he can't even see .  I  talked  about  the  giants:  Google.  Twitter.  Facebook.  How  the  lying scumbags were little more than modern-day witch hunters who cooperated with  cops  to  enforce  a  gazillion  laws  no  one  cared  about  but  made  them millions every year .  I  droned  on  about  encryption,  explaining  how  it  always  worked  it's wonders if it was automatic and running under the hood. I told him he had lazy man's opsec, a clown's, and that sooner or later someone would throw a grenade into that clown's wardrobe and it'd make all the papers with nice colorful photos of his private stash all laid bare. I told him of the types of encryption most used, HTTPS in the browser and cell to tower connections for his cellular calls, that they performed so well because he was unaware of their presence .  "Encrypt  everything,"  I  repeated.  I  hammered  this  over  and  over, especially on cell phones no matter if he had something to hide or not. "It should be there and working its magic under the hood without you having to hit the ON switch ." "Why?" he asked . "Because if you're only going to flip that encryption switch when and only when you need to secure your data, you relay that data's significance as though you'd pulled a fire alarm ."   We talked about Tor and it's brother Freenet and how both are used by Chinese  dissidents  but  that  since  every Chinese  dissident  uses  those  apps that this has caused problems for anyone wanting real anonymity. If its only used for committing dissident-like things then China's ruling elite class can cherry-pick anyone off one by one and all by that one lone homing signal. The same that the FBI had done  with a little help from my credit card  .  Then I said that the reverse is equally true . "If everybody employs encryption everywhere , then instead of it being a signal to the fire department to come put out a fire, it becomes impossible to  tell  who  is  using  it  to  chat  about  Leonardo  DeCaprio's  latest  round  of clubgirls from someone intent on sparking a revolution. Use encryption for every little thing you do and you'll save lives on the other side of the planet without even knowing it ."  He shot me a dumbfounded look like encryption had nothing to do with  cell phones or Tor .  "If you'd bothered to pay attention in sixth grade, you'd have learned all about state-sanctioned liars like the Gestapo in Nazi Germany and KGB in Soviet Russia, enough to see through that agent's lies." I pointed to the door. "Like Agent Frick. Didn't her name seem familiar to you ?"  "You  shut  your  mouth!"  he  snapped.  "They  had  a  no-knock  warrant  what was I supposed to do, tell em' to get lost ?"  "You just answered your own question ." "Huh ?" "You shut your mouth. You said it brother. You don't say squat without  an attorney ."  He thought on this for a long while before I continued . "Something  else,  too.  You  also  failed  on  account  of  having  an unencrypted phone and PC. If the encrypted data is in your hands and not theirs you're in less danger of being bullied around. You have more leeway. Do China dissidents? In China once they take away encryption  and  guns, they'll  seize  your  property  rights,  birth  rights,  your  progeny  and  what follows  after  that  is  a  bloody  mutiny  or  complete  slavery  where  all  legal rights are changed so that you cannot resist. You cannot fight back ."  "And after that?" he asked . "Who  knows.  The  Stalinist  regime  may  enact  a  murder  campaign  to eliminate anyone perceived as an enemy of the state. That's anyone with a gun  or  encrypted  files.  You  saw  what  happened  to  all  those  screaming   Muslims over there in Beijing a few years back. They rounded up all those fools and shot them at dawn and didn't look back ."  "Probably  didn't  wait  till  dawn  I  reckon,"  he  said.  "They  ain't  used  encryption though is what I heard ."  amendment in the United States ."  I  smiled.  "Might  not  have  helped  anyway.  But  thank  God  for  the  5th  A long silence. I needed one more example. Something modern . "Look  at  Apple  and  the  FBI.  The  Feds  wanted  to  set  a  precedent  in  breaking that terrorist's phone ."  "Precedent? Why's that?" he asked . "Take any random shooter's phone. The FBI already has the chat logs, flash drives, and iCloud data from them. They just make those statements to get  public  support  for  backdoors  since  there's  nothing  the  data  on  the iPhone can tell them that they don't know already ."  "But if that happens ..." "Everyone's  screwed  a  hundred  ways  from  Sunday.  Apple  gave  the them access to everything that exists and still gave them additional forensic advice  on  top  of  that.  That  fact  alone  proved  it  was  a  backdoor  fishing expedition ."  "Yeah. Yeah yer right I figger ." "And it's impossible for a backdoor to target just one phone. Any new backdoor will target everyone's phone, every class, at a minimum, such as one iPhone 5c affecting all the others. The FBI wants Apple to code in a backdoor that's signed by Apple without messing up the decryption keys. Do that and it would almost certainly escalate international tensions about European privacy too, not just the US ."  He nodded slowly . "They'd blot out any hope of Safe Harbor for good by proving that safe  harbor is anything but 'safe '."  Underneath  his  long-sleeved  shirt  I  could  see  he  was  wearing  a  that hideous Lord of the Rings tee, still grey and ragged and reeking of the same cheap Bud Light Lime he'd swigged on opening night. At the tip I could see it was either Gandalf or Saruman peeking over the mountaintops. I couldn't tell which .  "This isn't Saruman tinkering around. This is global Sauron, creating his  Ring ."  "But I'm just one guy. One peon ."   "You only need one guy, one peon ." I pointed out the window, up at the clouds. "See that? Picture yourself way  up  there  in  a  grand  hall  with  your  great-grandfather  and  several generations of your lineage going back eons when they're all telling their brave tales. Imagine telling them with a straight face that you left it up to some other peon because you weren't up to learning how to evade not only Google but the NSA and the FBI because it's easier to just focus on you and your late nights blowing money on anti-freeze daiquiris and Angry Birds or Facebook  updates  and  pranking  the  FBI  building  with  a  truckload  of bullshit ."  "Now imagine them shaking their heads in disgust at this overgrown kid too proud to build out a fortress of doom - a guy whose only concerns were for  his  own  hide  and  to  hell  with  what  his  forefathers  fought  for.  They'd view you as lacking courage and any sense of ethics. They'd look upon you as  a  lesser  human  being.  A  joke  to  humanity.  A  sheep.  Can  you  imagine Frodo doing that to Elrond, Gandalf, Legolas and the rest of the crew and giving them a three-fingered salute as he slid that ring down his finger and snuck off into the night ?  "Hale no ." "Me neither. When push comes to shove it's our nonactions and not our actions that bury us. We dig our own graves far too often enough, brother, so let's not pay others to do it while we're still breathing. In the meantime I'll  show  you  how  to  smooth  that  ring  down  your  finger  so  you  can  give whoever else wants to spy on you a nice three-fingered salute ."  I  looked  over  and  noticed  a  few  synapses  misfiring.  But  a  little confusion wasn't the end of the world. So I showed him something from his favorite  social  media  outlet.  Youtube.  The  very  same  he'd  used  with  Tor, something even he could see the wisdom of employing. It was a classroom lecture  called  'Don't  Talk  to  Cops'.  Nothing  to  do  with  cell  phones,  mind you, but everything to do  or not to do  when a couple of G-Men show up at your house making unruly demands .  The day after that, I beat him to death with every opsec trick I knew on how  to  truly  be  anonymous  on  a  smartphone,  be  it  Android,  Blackberry, iPhone... anywhere, at any time .  And what I showed him that day is what I'm about to show you. Right  now .   CELL OPSEC AND THE POWERS THAT BE  "No one cared who I was until I put on the mask ."  - Bane, The Dark Knight Rises  Why The Government Hates Anonymity  M  OST  GOVERNMENTS  HATE  ANONYMITY.  They  hate  encryption too,  but  mostly  anonymity  since  it  covers  a  much  broader  range  of  the mutiny  they  fear.  Every  time  someone  learns  how  to  communicate anonymously , that iron death-grip that they hold on a person's life loosens like you wouldn't believe. The media paints it a different color, of course. They say that it's anonymity that drives all the internet's ills .  You've  heard  it  all  before.  Sexual  harassment.  Bullying.  Date  rape. Hackers. Identity thieves. Flying purple monkeys. And that if only we give the powers that be more reach or a longer vine into our private lives, then every bully and ogre'll burst into pillars of salt  instantly!  while the world trips right into a land of rainbows, unicorns and yellow submarines with a lofty lolling Ringo Starr leading the charge .  You already know it to be fake, of course. As fake as Data's artificial  But,  I'll  let  you  in  on  a  secret  not  many  know.  And  that  is  this. Anonymity encourages objectivity. Seriously, it does. It forces you to judge a person by the merits of their words alone .  thumb .   Think about it . How many times have you heard an interview of some new jazz artist or guitarist  whose  Randy  Rhoads-like  riffs  made  your  hour  long  commute more bearable, but somehow lacked that one ingredient that'd make them perfect in your mind's eye? You find yourself never fully satisfied with what you know of him, so you dig deeper. And deeper .  It's About Control  You  want  to  know  every  dirty  little  detail  of  his  life,  then  weigh  those details against his opinion. Little details like  His politics . His religion . His favorite foods . Which websites he likes and which he hates .  What movies he watches. What car he drives. What sexual preference  he likes. You could go on forever nitpicking the poor guy .  And it's dirty ethics to judge a person's merit in this way. But that's the way the global elite do it, every day, every hour. They prefer you make snap judgments because it reveals a ton of things about you as well. Things that are all easily trackable .  Let's face it . It's  so  much  easier  to  blow  someone's  idea  off  if  they  happen  to  be favoring the other guy running for President rather than judge a person by what is said. So they focus on the man's upbringing. Or race. Or gender. Or which side their ancestors fought on during the Civil War. You can get to a point where you run out of ad hominem's to hurl .  It's About Power  Dangerous ideas are good for anonymity. Try saying something outrageous on a political forum during an election year, but under a pseudonym. Use a cell  phone  without  the  aid  of  Tor.  Note  the  hesitation  you  feel  when  you   think of writing under your real name and saying something only someone like Smaug from the Hobbit would have the red-hot balls to say. That's the power  I'm  talking  about.  Anonymity  grants  that  to  you.  It  allows  you  to share controversial thoughts without fear of your house being firebombed with Molotov cocktails filled with flaming manure. And there's a few more perks I'll add to the bonfire .  Anonymity prevents you from getting fired for disagreeing . It prevents Google from getting your private data and selling it . It prevents you from being the target of stalkers, hitmen, and even an angry former lover intent on showing the world the raging alcoholic she lived with some 17 years ago - never mind that you've given up booze for ten years straight, all because she doesn't like the guy you're campaigning for  yes, yours truly  .  The reason why people are opposed to anonymity is that they want to bully, harass and oppress people they disagree with. It's because it's always easier to discredit the man than his ideas. When you get right down to it, total 100% honesty can only be accomplished anonymously .  "Well,"  you  start  to  say.  "You  don't  need  security  if  you  aren't  doing  something illegal ."  But that's how they want you to think . It's like saying you may as well not lock your door unless you're a thief. Same  thing.  We  all  have  to  take  action  to  protect  our  families  and  assets from those who steal, harm or burn. It's risk versus payoff, and where your freedom and peace of mind is concerned, the payoff is always worth it .  Imagine  that  you  live  in  the  Ninth  Ward  in  New  Orleans,  hurricane season. A city with thousands of law abiding citizens  and maybe 10,000 criminals . You install a good lock on your front door because it's wise to do  so.  Likewise,  you  should  install  one  on  whatever  portal  you  use  to connect to the Internet. In most people's case, this means their cell phone .  That brings up the dirty word called encryption. That is, encrypting your connection.  All  connections,  but  cell  phones  especially.  Most  people  shy away  from  this  because  they  think  they  need  to  be  some  kind  of  super- hacker or that real hackers only target celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence .  For  example,   to  encrypt  your  data,  any governmental agency can use this data to corral dissidents like you and I  if  Facebook  forgets    and those who'd make bitter enemies in the event of a revolution - all into a nice  little  easy-to-read  Matrix-green  display  for  a  round-up  when  the proverbial  crap  hits  the  fan.  This  isn't  all.  Questions  like  "Who  was  your best friend in high school?" can lead to other accounts being compromised . It's  the  same  whenever  I  have  to  shred  sensitive  documents.  Taxes, transcripts, copies of old love letters, copies of passports. I can say 'screw it' and shred only a few things since I hate sorting them all. But all it takes for my security model to collapse is one broken link in the chain. Much less headaches  to  shred  EVERY  sensitive  document  and  gain  peace  of  mind over having to sort each and every one of them .  Therefore  it's  best  to  learn  how  to  encrypt  everything  from  the beginning instead of trying to cherry pick which is the 'best' document to be encrypted. You avoid not only government agencies like the IRS and DEA but  also  stalkers,  vindictive  ex-spouses  and  former  business  partners.  It's much  easier  to  lose  a  fully  encrypted  device  than  one  with  only  a  few encrypted  folders.  Encryption  is  not  just  about  preventing  eavesdroppers from reading data. It also prevents them from changing it .   ANONYMITY AND PRIVACY  A nonymity :  Noun  an·o·nym·i·ty  \ˌa-nə-ˈni-mə-tē\:  the  quality  or  state  of  being  unknown to most people : the quality or state of being anonymous .  G ood ol' Webster, who never fails to give us a watered down definition on how to not do something of paramount importance. The word itself comes from Greek and means 'without a name', but that doesn't really tell us how to be invisible. Two points to make on this .  First, if we're talking about true anonymity , the kind where you're really off the grid and can stay off the radar even if a Delta Force team is sent in to capture you, then you're not only nameless but traceless . This book will be of little use to you because you're a Houdini already and Houdinis rarely like  to  have  helpers.  They  prefer  going  it  alone.  It's  the  same  if  you're  a famous  old  timer  with  old  money,  celebrity  status  or  fame  who  can  buy your way out of the country without a passport .  But traceless anonymity - which many believe an impossibility on cell phones - gets harder to maintain just as a boat's navigation wheel becomes harder to control in a thunderstorm. One jab in the right place will sink a boat just as surely as if Zeus himself lit one up in her backside and it won't matter how much you spent on polishing her tushy. The same happened to me when Hurricane Katrina slammed home in 2005 .   Katrina  A  Category-5  hurricane,  also  known  as  the  'finger  of  God',  came  pretty close to sending me and my frizzy cat up to the pearly gates on a lightning bolt .  The wind barely took off a few shingles at first. No big deal I thought. It happens in most heavy storms after all. Then the kitchen window shattered. Then  another.  And  another.  Then  the  darkness  came,  only  before  I  could panic I heard a propane tank blow up in the garage .  BOOM . I  know  what  you're  thinking.  Propane  tanks  don't  just  explode  or implode  or  rupture  or  come  apart  on  their  own.  In  fact,  an  exploding propane tank is a rarity and doesn't happen nearly as often as the zombie movies portray. Only this one did because in a Cat-5 hurricane, anything's possible .  Truth be told, I didn't care about the tank. I was more worried about the darkness. That darkness was so thick you could feel it crawl onto your skin like  some  tar-covered  gelatinous  monster  straight  out  of  The  Thing.  I looked  out  onto  the  street  and  I  remember  thinking  a  lot  of  fat  good anonymity  did  in  this  situation.  I  couldn't  see  or  hear  squat  but  I  could worry. Oh yes, on that I was an ace, the top of the class. No question .  I  tried  to  calm  myself  but  it  only  got  worse  as  I  couldn't  remember where  I'd  put  the  candles  the  last  time  this  happened.  I  did  know  broken windows  were  replaceable  though.  They  were,  right?  Yes,  of  course. Besides, how many times had the electricity gone out when it rained? Every afternoon if you lived in New Orleans and it seemed to happen all the time no matter Mardi Gras or Jazzfest or how many crocs swam down the street when the sewers clogged up. You could set your watch by it .  Soon I had two feet of water in my living room and Fritz the cat was looking  pretty  pathetic,  like  a  wet  hamster  who'd  stuck  it's  paw  into  an electrical  socket.  Panicked,  the  meows  began  to  sound  like  those  wailing police  sirens  on  CSI.  I  couldn't  understand  a  thing  and  to  be  honest  he sounded a lot like Charlie Brown's teacher after a smoke and a stroke. He wanted out as did I .  I  looked  out  to  see  the  marina  sailboats  bobbing  like  bathtub  ducks when the howling wind began to whistle and whirl through every room in   the house, with a couple of my favorite anonymity books floating out the front door. Bad luck or poetic justice ?  "Screw these shenanigans!" I said. Who'd ever gamble that this storm was the whisk-you-off-to-Oz variety? Not me. And not the cat as far as I could tell. Only a moment later, it got worse. A lot worse .  The storm began to blow in a lot of small objects from the street up and over the gutter. Pine cones. Coke cans. A Mardi Gras necklace that'd been stuck on the telephone wire for ages. Stripper panties. A nuke-green Hand Grenade  drink  container  from  Tropical  Isle,  New  Orleans  most  powerful drink which admittedly was pretty tasty though it looked like an alien sex toy. At any rate I was in for some serious wind-based PTSD .  And with so many holes in my home, something struck me. I realized that any passerby could see inside and get a glimpse of my goods. All of em. I was unarmed and, God help me, without a Rottweiler to fend off any looters. Dead man walking. The looters I'd scared off during the previous flood might return for seconds if the storm got bad enough, and this time I was sure it would. Fritz and I were sitting ducks so I grabbed him in all his wet tuxedo fur and jumped into my fire-engine-red truck and headed off to the Northshore an hour away. The cat was now down to 3 lives .  First Point : The first point is that one weak point can kill any security perimeter you thought you'd set up just as surely as my own broken windows killed mine. Maybe it was bad electrical lines. Loose ones. One lightning strike ended it. Boom and done .  With only one window gone a vagrant  or varmint or mutant  might've peeked inside for shelter and quickly deduced from the street garbage that it was an abandoned house. With every window gone, that same bum doesn't have to peek inside. He can see from the street what I've got. No guns? No dogs? Nothing? Oh but he sees the display case with a lot of shiny objects inside that he can pawn .  Why, even a brass lantern that'd fetch a few coins. Later I'd return to see a floating corpse, one straight out of The Walking Dead, floating near my house. I never quite recovered from that grisly sight .  In  any  case,  I  knew  I  couldn't  sleep  there  since  it'd  be  like  using multiple  layers  of  condoms  given  by  an  ex-stalker.  Each  one  with  small holes. What did help me was having walkie-talkies at my disposal. Not Tor .   And not Skype or Google Chat or any other corporate solution, where the entirety of my conversations gets sold on a silver platter to the highest bidder.  Those  guys  have  only  their  own  interests  in  mind,  none  of  which involve my safety. They care up to the point when they can make truckloads of  cash.  That  and  the  act  of  filing  away  those  conversations  into  stealthy databases and mined for future patterns and trends. Trends on me, my lover and dog and cat .  So  you  don't  owe  Microsoft  or  Google  or  Apple  anything.  But  it's  in your best interest to learn how to live without them, for when they day of reckoning   perhaps  by  a  lightning  strike   finally  comes,  it'll  come  like  a thief in the night . Second Point : You're a one man show. You and you alone are responsible for whatever outcome you find yourself in. Luck favors the prepared and you'll survive a storm far and away better if you prepare beforehand. Don't be the guy who thinks  that  good  opsec  involves  bubble-gumming  his  3.5  floppies  to  the duct work behind the vents in his room .  Third  :  Absolutes  where  good  security  is  concerned  don't  exist.  It's impossible to achieve 100% anonymity just as it's impossible to get 100% hack-proof  data  centers  or  100%  non-casualty  rates  on  the  battlefield  no matter how good your opsec .  There's always a way in. There's always a leak, somewhere, waiting for a couple of fishermen to discover. A good security planner will weigh risk and apply his resources accordingly but good anonymity by way of phones, especially cell phones , comes down to who is trying to be anonymous from what  and  for  how  long.  Disappearing  from  Google  is  not  the  same  as disappearing from the NSA .  Take  Tor,  for  instance.  Tor  is  far  easier  to  maintain  anonymity  on  a laptop or PC using Linux than it ever will on Android. It's a nice enough tool  but  there  are  many  apps  that  bleed  your  IP.  Apps  like  those  dealing with torrents .  If  you're  planning  on  using  Tor  on  your  phone  to  download  torrents, stop reading. Return this book for a full refund. Other than clogging up the Tor network and making the Tor experience a rotten apple for other users, it is hell on anonymity services since it routes your REAL IP ADDRESS to destinations unknown. It does so anonymously of course, in the same way an envelope may be delivered by anonymous couriers. But with your real   name  and  phone  number  on  the  inside  of  that  envelope,  well  what's  the point ?  T  he  first  basic  tactic  is  to  change  IP  addresses,  and  do  so  frequently. Depending on the tool you use, most IP capable devices have the ability to set  their  own  IP  address.  This  tactic  does  come  with  a  penalty  though, because  the  frequent  changing  of  IP  addresses  is  highly  anomalous. Depending on the internet service you're using at the time, it may be noted faster than you think. And if you're using Skype, well if they wanted to they could easily stream your voice to two locations at once, and there's nothing you can do to prevent that .  As  well,  any  site  that  allows  anonymous   or  at  least,  accountless  posting  can  pretty  much  only  block  visitors  by  IPs.  Then  some  of  those people who got blocked are going to find a way to mask their IP  proxies, Tor, etc.  and get those IPs blocked too. Eventually you'll learn as I did that the problem isn't the websites, it's the jackasses that got them blocked. Your milage may vary .  T he second basic tactic is to spoof and twin an IP address. With the first method you are using IP addresses that are valid for your local node, but are currently unused. For a 'spoof and twin' you want to use an IP address that another  node  is  currently  using.  This  method  only  works  when  your network adapter can be put into promiscuous mode and read traffic destined for other IP addresses. It requires that your device time transmission so as not  to  interfere  with  the  target  device,  and  that  it  continue  reading  open traffic until the target device receives a reply from whatever server you sent to .  Even if I provide you with the best available anonymity methods, if you are  doing  something  that  would  attract  the  attention  of  law  enforcement, those  methods  will  only  delay  your  eventual  de-anonimization.  Anyone with  the  capability  of  enlisting  the  help  of  large  national  or  international telecommunication companies will find you in hours. That said, I will show you  ways  you  could   in  theory,  say   prevent  this  event  from  happening. Read on .   8 DEADLY MYTHS OF CELL PHONES  W e need to  dispel  a  few  myths  before  you  learn  how  to  go  off  the  grid Michael Weston style. The first one is that smartphones are better at hiding you because of all the stealth apps available. It just isn't true .  M yth 1.  Smartphones are better than older 'dummy' phones .  Smarter, yes but better at hiding you? A very loud no with arms waving wildly  from  the  rooftop.  Consider  for  a  moment  why  Russia  decided  to revert  to  typewriters  after  the  NSA  scandal  broke  over  the  German chancellor, Angela Merkel, found out that the NSA had been listening in on her calls for years. If you think it'd be much harder for any bureaucrat to spy on you if you reverted to 'the old methods', you'd be right .  Flip 'dummy' phones are superior to smartphones for good operational security, period. For any kind. They don't like to 'phone home' for one thing, and the less apps they support, the tighter your security. The reason for this is  that  most  hacks  and  exploits  target  the  most  commonly  used  operating systems,  like  Windows  and  Android.  And  the  'superhackers'  at  the  NSA love it when you use two dozen apps that you know little about. Take a hint from the Russians .  M yth 2.  Home is safe as long as you're using Tor .  Wrong again, a thousand times wrong. Home is a radioactive minefield as far as anonymity is concerned. Imagine yourself trying to handle a barrel   of  green  radioactive  goo  without  a  protective  suit.  It's  dangerously  gooey stuff. Though I'll grant you'd survive it maybe long enough to call up HQ and tell them you botched the mission. Keep your phone somewhere distant even if all you want is to keep the wife out of your business. No need to leave a loaded gun around .  M yth 3.  It doesn't matter where you activate your phone .  Whenever I activate a phone, the opening scene from my favorite film, 'The Abyss', rolls in my head like an old film projector full of nostalgia and greasy engineers. One scene still haunts me to this day years after seeing it. It's that horrific opening scene where an underwater alien ship speeds too close  to  The  Montana,  a  U.S.  Navy  nuclear-tipped  submarine  operating deep in the Cayman Trough in the Caribbean Sea .  The  sleek,  alien  thing  glides  along  at  a  whopping  130  knots.  I  still  remember the Captain's words .  'Nothin' goes 130 knots!' he yells just as the power goes out . The  velocity  of  the  alien  ship  knocks  out  almost  every  navigational instrument on the sub, sonar included. A few nail-biting seconds go by and when the power returns, the sub smashes nose first into a cliff and before anyone can breathe, the whole ship dives to the bottom of the ocean floor. But not before an officer launches the sub's emergency beacon .  That beacon breaches the surface in a flurry of little beeps and pulsing red light in the thick of midnight as ten foot waves crash all around. Picture a tiny red blip on a ten foot whitecap going Beep. Beep. BEEP. It's scary to think that the Navy found them. But find them they did .  It's not all that different when you activate your phone in any random place, where the activation itself will send such a signal to multiple parties interested  in  making  your  life,  well,  not  very  private  at  all.  Maybe  not initially mind you. It's the slow boiling frog scenario for most. First they'll want to know things like  Where you live . Which sites you visit . What keywords you're punching into Google Where you're using your Mastercard .   And who's related to you on all the social media sites .  All of this is tracked very quickly unless you've taken action beforehand to  limit  who  gets  this  'emergency  beacon'.  So  how  do  we  get  around  it? There's a few no so obvious ways .  One poor man's solution is to pay some starving English major at the local college ten bucks to activate it for you at a crowded college library you'll  likely  never  visit.  Be  polite  of  course,  but  know  that  this  fellow mustn't have any hard data on you except for any fake data you provide. If he starts asking questions, find some other urchin who isn't so nosy. Also know that this isn't the ideal solution. It just sets the stage for a very long process of fogging up the trail .  M  yth  4.   Untraceable  Burners  Can't  Be  Bought  Online   at  least  not anonymously    This one is false as well. The problem with buying things on the Deep Web isn't that doing so requires you to be incognito. It's doing so without getting a lemon. You can in fact buy burners on the Deep Web  more on this later . For now know that one option is to use the Tor Browser Bundle to purchase anonymous burners, though like everything else on the deep web such as drugs, iPhones, Cuban cigars, you may be better off using offline proxies to purchase anything electronic. Chinese counterfeiting is popular on  Darknet  sites  as  you'll  soon  see.  They  fool  enough  buyers  to  leave glowing reviews at first, so it's buyer beware most of the time. That said, you can just as easily find a diamond in the rough offline .  M  yth  5.   Using  Cash  to  Purchase  Burners  at  Retail  Stores  is  Always Anonymous .  Little mom and pop stores are one thing, but big retail stores are truly privacy-hating places, especially where the Big Box Corporation has run off all  the  little  shops  in  town.  Those  little  shops  made  great  places  to  forge alliances. That said, if you bought a burner from a big box store you should wait a month before you activate it. When I worked in security we'd rotate the footage daily, but did no firm deletions until 30 to 45 days out. You also   must  not  be  seen  talking  on-campus  with  that  college  English  major  we discussed. Again this depends on the level of opsec you require, but this is at a most basic, elementary level. We'll get more advanced as we go along .  M yth 6.  No One Cares About Your Contact List  Two things to say. The first is that contacts are dangerous . They create a pattern that, when lit up on a giant NSA screen, is like lighting a stick of dynamite with you being on the end of that stick. Boom again .  Much like a 'hidden' partition on a hard drive that stores two operating systems   one  real  and  one  fake  a'  la  Veracrypt ,  you  want  to  set  up  false leads to make it look like you have contacts where none exist. This fogs up your  trail.  One  burner  must  not  have  the  same  contacts  as  the  next.  Any contacts provide less risk on paper than in a phone list since most SIM data will often give you away . thing   triangulation  and  pattern  matching. Intelligence agencies favor "mirroring" devices over all others because of unique  identifiers  involved.  Over  time  you  can  give  yourself  away  by repeatedly using the same pattern, such as this :  The  second   involves   House  --->  Subway  --->  Verizon   or  your  usual  workplace   --->  Girlfriend's House ---> Home Again  Taking this route over and over establishes a mobility pattern. If anyone of  importance  comes  looking  for  you,  they'll  find  you  whether  you  use  a burner phone or not. The way to prevent this is to know your surroundings. Conversations  are  almost  always  the  same  length  of  time.  That  is,  when talking with the same people in the same place .  Think about it. Your mother calls you on days when she doesn't work or when  the  hubby  is  at  work,  usually  for  the  same  45  minute  stretch.  Your best  friend  John,  probably  15-20  minutes  since  there's  less  emotional rambling. Men tend to not beat around the bush when talking other men, but over a month's time this creates a pattern of recognition if paired with other calls you make. All it takes is three or so matching patterns and it's game over .  M yth 7.  No One Cares About Broken Phones in Alleyways   Unless you want to go interrogating every bum from your home to the city limits, never throw out your phone 'as is', and especially not anywhere near  your  home.  They  should  be  securely  wiped  and  then  broken  down piece by piece as though it were some ancient artifact belonging to some undead wizard .  M  yth  8.   You're  Anonymous  on  any  Wireless  Network   as  long  as  you don't do anything stupid    This  is  the  most  deadly  myth.  It  has  to  do  with  using  WiFi  networks securely  ,  and  you  wouldn't  believe  how  many  high  school  geeks  think they're masters at Tor and hacking only to find the police show up because they  threatened  the  wrong  person  online  from  the  wrong  dorm.  On  more than  a  few  security  sites,  I  see  apps  like  Macspoofer  and  the  like  being recommended. Using any of these wonder-apps may prove detrimental to your freedom .  If your MAC address is in a constant state of identity crisis  or, always changing ,  you're  narrowing  the  search  parameters  available  to  any adversary who wants to find you. For a group it draws massive unwanted attention.  How?  Because  the  access  point  is  connected  to  multiple  MAC numbers over a short period of time. It looks suspicious. Any administrator worth his salt will look into it. Better to look like everyone else rather than paint yourself black when surrounded by white sheep .  Mobile  anonymity  is  difficult,  frustrating,  bothersome  and  generally  a pain  in  the  neck.  Harder  still  is  severing  the  link  to  your  everyday  life because  depending  on  technology  to  do  it  all  for  you  is  a  fool's  game.  A dead end. You need a good security mindset, diligence and the stamina to develop a mental trigger to predict accidents before they happen. We've all heard  of  what  happens  when  a  loaded  gun  is  left  on  a  table  within  arm's reach of a youngster. You need to anticipate this before it happens. To that, ask yourself the following :  Who do you need to hide from and why ? How  much  hard  work  and  maintenance  does  it  involve  versus  doing  Does it pass the effort to payoff test ? How much work is it to do it right versus getting caught and suffering the  embarrassment  of  being  under  the  spotlight  and,  heaven  forbid,  the  little ?   family ?  Whether you use Linux Mint or Windows 7 or a Mac, you need to kill any  application  if  you  entered  any  personal  info  into  it  that  can  aid  in tracing you. Usernames that you used on forums should never be used in your anonymous phone or anonymous  like Linux Mint!  laptop .  Also, phone numbers, places of work, nicknames, hangouts, girls you've dated, online games - all of these are part of your real persona that leaves a trail right to your front door. That real persona needs to go into a coffin the moment the anonymous You comes out. Only then can we know ourselves well  enough  not  to  be  bothered  with  worrying  if  we  did  everything correctly. By that time, we've done it so many times that it's an automatic timepiece in our subconscious. Do this and we'll see our true enemies more clearly, one of which is the NSA .   HOW THE NSA SPIES ON YOU  L et's say a few words on how the powers that be trace calls to begin with. It's  a  little  technical  but  then  it's  always  preferable  to  know  the  enemy's capabilities .  If  you're  like  me  then  you've  probably  rolled  your  eyeballs  enough times whenever a bad guy on Burn Notice or CSI had twenty seconds or so to  taunt  the  FBI  before  his  location  was  traced.  It's  all  baloney,  and  it happens in every single cop show on TV I've ever seen. They think we're lemmings. Well, a few of us are .  The  Rockford  Files,  CSI,  and  Burn  Notice.  I  love  every  one  of  these shows but it just doesn't matter how much I love em because you can't love it  when  they  get  it  wrong.  And  get  it  wrong  they  do  aplenty.  They  get  it wrong because the writers are not detectives themselves and many just want to get the script done asap, so they never shadow any in their day to day operations  at  all.  But  best-selling  authors  like  James  Patterson  do  their homework. Go figure .  Phone signals came inline some forty years ago and back then how you got  connected  was  very  different  than  today.  A  call  was  setup  from  one switch to the next, and the next, and then the next until finally a connecting- circuit relayed your voice .  These  days  most  switches  are  simultaneous  since  most  calls  are  over SS7   that  is,  the  Signaling  System  which  manages  calls .  Each  calling station is traceable at the beginning too, so the trace countdown you see on most cop shows really does stretch the truth. But it makes for a suspenseful police drama and, let's face it, most people don't mind suspending disbelief for an hour if they can get good entertainment .   I've trouble doing this though. Perhaps I'm just an impatient guy when it comes to police procedural shows but one episode on CSI came across as gut-wrenchingly  sloppy.  It  showed  a  low-level  programmer  realigning  a satellite from his laptop without any assistance from any other agency .  I nearly  fell  out  of  my  chair.  It  takes  an  insane  amount  of  teamwork  and coordination  between  other  agencies  to  do  something  of  that  technical caliber .  Mobile phone tracing does require more resources than a landline since a  cell  phone  number  is  not  connected  to  a  single  switch.  But  it  isn't impossible for a mobile phone provider to locate which towers the phone used or what region the call was made. One way of doing it is by comparing signal  strength  and  then  correlating  that  with  the  antenna  that  held  your signal. If you've got an unencrypted non-burner phone, the GPS chip inside will give up your location to any who are in possession of it .  I bet you're wondering how come you can't trace a mobile phone like  your cell phone company can .  The reason is the same reason that you can't identify individuals by IP address alone. Only the telephone company knows because they have the logs. They own the equipment. They have easy access. Even police need a subpoena to get subscriber access from a VPN,  or virtual private network . They can't hack the system for one individual without risking their job  or political  career .  Well,  the  NSA  can  I  suppose,  only  that's  a  whole  other enchilada. But for the internet itself no node within it is any more special than any of the others since it uses the same band .  Unlike phones . Wait a second, you say. If that's true, then how am I supposed to prevent  my phone from being tracked ?  The  short  answer  is:  You  can't  without  the  right  opsec  and  the  right mindset. If you're using towers then you can be traced, generally speaking. But  this  isn't  a  perfect  world  and  those  towers  aren't  perfect  either.  They produce  false  positives  just  like  our  anti-virus  programs  do,  albeit differently. But you can toy with the triangulation angle a bit to obfuscate the trail .  One method involves using a PBX system to delay identity discovery. Notice I said delay ,  not  eradicate.  The  way  to  do  it  is  to  connect  with  a company's  PBX  system  via  dial-up.  This  will  have  them  looking  in  the wrong spot. It's still possible for them to trace you given enough time but   not without going though the company logs. That takes time too and to be honest they'd rather not bother unless ordered to do so by a higher power .  You  can  also  do  it  by  creating  false  leads  using  radio  waves   yes,  a radio  that links your voice to your phone. Do it right and the guy who is chasing  you  will  end  up  chasing  the  wind.  You  can  set  the  signal  to whatever  you  want.  A  hundred  feet  becomes  a  half  a  mile  and  now  Mr. Smith's area to catch you has suddenly become much larger. Much larger means more time, more money and more resources. However, neither of the above methods mean anything if you are either one of three things :  - Lax with your metadata  i.e. those you regularly contact  . - Lax with your situational awareness . - Lax with opsec .   THE NSA FINGERPRINTS CELLS  B ob from accounting claims one burner is as good as the next. Tom agrees somewhat, but insists you need a voodoo doll and a crazy formula he read on  an  Ars  Technica  thread  to  really  make  it  anonymous.  The  new  girl  in programming, one sexy Carrie-Anne, insists it's really what you do outside of a phone that matters. Whom do we trust? Bob the Yes Man, Tom the Tax Expert or the goth-chick-turned-hacker Carrie-Anne? What is 'good enough' anyway ?  It depends on where you are. One burner can be as good as the next in Southeast Asia if that's where you're headed. Or it may be 'good enough' if you're trekking to the South Pole or diving in some bombed out Japanese sub off the Philippines and aren't really hiding from anyone except Great White sharks .  But Bangkok and the Philippines aren't North America or the UK. It's tough  defeating  towering  bullies  over  small  badgers  though  both  pose  a serious threat. I know because I've tried – and failed. When you get right down to it, it mostly depends on who you're trying to hide from .  But regardless of who that 'someone' is, there are two main types of cell technology we can work with. The first is GSM, which stands for Global System for Mobiles, and CDMA which stands for Code Division Multiple Access .  You and I can't cross them, which is why I can't use my AT&T cell on Verizon's  service.  Most  of  the  major  carriers  make  it  simple  for  LEOs  to trace calls because they separate burner phone traffic from prepaid traffic. A Sprint executive may say it's because they need to prioritize traffic. Only   what he doesn't tell you is that it's used by the NSA and law enforcement to track down 'anonymous' callers .  The NSA does this by 'fingerprinting' every call. Fingerprint analysis is based on the contacts unique to each caller. That is, your unique contacts, as well as how long you talk to those contacts and how long they talk to their contacts. It all adds up to a nice fat profile on you that is shady at best and outright evil at worst .  Let's say our friend Jerry talks to Kramer, George and Elaine every day as he sits down with his Wheaties. He has several phones, different carriers, only  the  info  he  adds  per  'Friend'  per  contact  makes  for  one  helluva traceable target. Every bit of data on these contacts  that is, Kramer, George & Elaine  are placed on the SIM card and match the exact contact data on any other burner he uses. For federal law enforcement to track him down would be laughably easy .  For the NSA, a few clicks in the Prism system and from there it'd be no  effort at all to find his geographical location .   LOCATION, LOCATION  S  o  then,  how  to  solve  this  problem?  Well  first  we  need  to  define  what 'location' really means to the Big Data players .  Carriers like Verizon store data based on your phone's signal-strength. That is, the 'weight' of your call between you and the nearest cell tower. It stores a mind-boggling amount of numerical data on your behavior and, at the  simplest  level,  this  is  known  as  'triangulation'  locating.  The  GPS functions  in  your  phone  use  it  more  often  than  you  realize.  Apps  like Google  Earth  and  Maps.Me  use  it  as  much  as  they  can  and  provide  your whereabouts to distant servers - and as a side hustle bonus are better able to target  you  with  ads  based  on  that  data.  It's  a  real  juicy  side  of  income  if you've got Google's or the NSA's data centers to sort it all out .  The second thing to note is the Christmas Day error. Come one wintry Christmas  morning  when  the  cardinals  and  sparrows  flutter  about  in  the snowy front yard, you open your presents to find a fancy smartphone, one loaded with gizmo after gizmo. It cost a fortune and you can't wait to hit the ignition. What's the first thing you do? What's the first thing anyone does ?  They'll call up that number to activate it. Lickety split . They're way too sloshed to realize it, but doing that is like a tipsy mouse nibbling a morsel of cheese in a trap with the cat watching from the cover of darkness .  Before  they  can  kick  back  another  shot  of  Jack  Daniels  and  eggnog, they blurt out their full name, home address and their mistress's password in front of the wife. From that point on it's near impossible to spoof anything because of the correlation of that phone with their real location - and all the   locations and profiles of every phone user in the house. Why do they need your contact list now that you've connected to everyone in your household ?  And it ain't just the NSA either .   HOW THE IRS SPIES ON YOU  I t's not just the NSA that uses Stingray surveillance technology to spy on the  citizenry.  The  IRS  now  uses  it  as  well  to  capture  metadata  from  cell phones. They're a part of the Big Data empire too, and they demand only the best tools of the trade: the most expensive and the most invasive. They use something known as IMSI interceptors  or cell site simulators  .  Worse, IRS agents now have the same authority previously held only by judges. This power gives them authority to install Pen register devices so they can spy on people they suspect aren't giving their fair share. Or anyone that challenges them for that matter .  Historically, these were used by the FBI to capture recordings by Mafia members  or  Mexican  Cartel  leaders  in  Juarez.  You  know,  real  criminals. Nowadays everyone with a U.S. passport is fair game and if they run out of real criminals to prosecute, well by golly they'll just invent a few more to keep the the gravy train running full-steam. There's even rumors flying that student  loan  defaulters  will  have  their  passports  revoked.  Not  too  far fetched  since  they  do  the  same  with  child  support  obligations,  and  that's only $2500, not $50,000 .  Anyway. From the eagle's viewpoint you can see the IRS' Stingrays are high-tech doppelgangers. They are clones of a cell tower that can force any phone within reach to silently connect so that any metadata can be siphoned off .  Kinda like one of those parasites you see in PBS nature documentaries, where  the  plant  benefits  and  the  parasite  benefits  in  a  kind  of  symbiosis that's a pain to study in a college textbook but fun to watch. Only where the IRS is concerned, the benefits flow in one direction only .   The kicker? That parasite will die far sooner than the plant. Think on this  for  a  moment.  What  do  you  think's  going  to  happen  if  your  country suddenly  finds  itself  unable  to  borrow  from  anyone?  If  you've  studied history you already know the answer. They steal their own citizens' wealth in a very, well, parasitic-like way. We've seen this in Argentina, Poland and France .  Don't believe for a minute the IRS will only be using this spy tech on the millionaire fat cats living abroad. Those guys are small potatoes. If they were to seize every fatcat's funds in every country on Earth, it'd be enough to pay for Medicare for a scant 3 years. Then they'd be right back where they  started.  If  you  don't  believe  it  then  allow  me  to  quote  a  rather  well- known statesman on this topic :  “I f you will not fight for right when you can easily win without blood shed; if you will not fight when your victory is sure and not too costly; you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival. There may even be a worse case. You may have to fight when there is no hope of victory, because it is better to perish than to live as slaves .”  - Winston S. Churchill   HOW GOOGLE SPIES ON YOU  G oogle  loves  you  to  death.  They  love  everyone  actually,  or  more  to  the point, everyone's private data. There's gold in them ones and zeros and most people offer em up quite willingly for their daily digital fix .  Google  loves  to  store  data  about  you  when  you're  not  looking.  That's what happens when you invite a vampire into your home. Tough as nails to kick out and they leave a trail of confusion and mayhem when they finally do  hightail  it.  Like  little  cousin  Eddie  whose  long  since  outlived  his welcome .  As a fairly strong privacy advocate, I like to manage that online privacy by  controlling  the  data  I  make  available  online.  The  problem  is  that Google's been getting smarter at meta-managing me by my own keywords on  other  search  engines.  The  only  option  is  to  enact  whatever  privacy controls are required yourself. Or don't use any of Google's services. And that my friend is a very long list that includes :  Google Search Gmail Google Plus Google Alerts Google Books Google Finance Google Groups Google Hotel Finder Google Flight Search Google Translate Google Trends   Life Search  or Google China   ... and a host of others . The master list of course is a lot longer . The data-mining operations for each  of  these  services  cost  millions  each  day.  Google's  algorithm  tries  to predict what you'll want tomorrow or next Christmas. That's fine with some people because it's legal after all and they've been doing that since forever . The problem is that they share this with any government who pays them or allows them entry into the country. This becomes a problem overseas if you need to use online storage. Enter Google Drive .  Google Drive  G oogle Drive makes for  one  helluva  solution  for  business  travelers  who need to protect sensitive files from cross-border guards. Guard who love to confiscate  laptops  and  pen  drives  because,  well,  they  want  to  look competent .  Just upload the data to Big G before you hit the US border and you're good to go. This also works if you have to travel to out of the way places like Philippines .  Well, most of the time. So what's the problem then ? Google  is  the  problem,  just  as  iCloud  was  a  problem  for  a  few celebrities  who  got  hacked.  It  happens  every  year.  Just  ask  Jennifer Lawrence how she feels about tossing her pics 'in the cloud' after her nudes got hacked and leaked. There's plenty of other risks too :  Law enforcement can access it with a judge-signed warrant . The NSA can give the FBI full access to your files . Any alphabet agency can access it. Agencies like the DEA, ATF, CIA, & the IRS if they have the NSA's ability to bypass Google's encryption  which Google only beefed up after the media revealed that the NSA was siphoning data from their tailpipe .  Employees may upload personal info in the cloud which, if hacked, cause financial issues and maybe even a lawsuit .   Any bank you deal with may deny you any reimbursement of lost funds if you store bank details in the cloud. They'll consider it 'negligence' on your part .  I t's more effective to use an encryption app like Veracrypt or PGP to work with Google Drive. What I do is :  - First fire up Veracrypt or Truecrypt 7.1a - Create a storage file , - Pick 2 algo-based encryption schemes with SHA-512 keys - Put all my sensitive files in there . - Then and only then do I upload the encrypted files to Google Drive . When I need to alter my work, say update a new draft of a novel I'm working on but don't want Google scanning it for 'offending' terms, I just copy the encrypted doc out of Google Drive, update it and then re-encrypt and re-upload to Google Drive. If I ever want to delete it, I just delete the encrypted storage file. It's easy peasy and it'll be eons before Google has Skynet's quantum computers to crack the encryption key .  Encryption and Google  A s I mentioned, any governmental agency can and will access your cloud storage  via  a  subpoena  sent  to  Google.  But  what  are  the  consequences  if law enforcement confiscates your phone? Your laptop? It happens. And as it so  happens  you  may  be  arrested  on  a  totally  separate  case  but  they've insufficient evidence .  Except your laptop and phone are now in their hands. Here are the risks,  number one of which is :  Doppelgangers. Enemy numero uno. Any login cookies for Google services  like Google Docs  can be copied to impersonate you, or they can login to all Google accounts in Firefox or Chrome and act as the Real You .   They can steal your password from the browser's password storage file if you've no master password set . And with your password they can reset it in Google and all Google services . Chrome might cache parts of files or documents the last time you logged in . Or they can use Data Recovery Tools to retrieve your deleted files .  Y ou can avoid each of the above scenarios by using a full-disk encryption program. As long as your phone or laptop is powered off when they take it  and you're not in a jurisdiction where they can beat the password out of you , you're safe as long as the country in question respects your right to remain silent .  As  for  a  searching  solution  that  replaces  Google  outright,  I  use  and recommend  DuckDuckGo.  It's  not  as  laser-refined  as  Google  is,  but  they must operate exactly as advertised. One thing they're very clear on is their privacy policy, which states :  They don't track you . They don't sell your search data to other websites They don't require cookies . They don't collect metadata on you They don't store your search history .  It's black and white without a lot of legalese that most people just skip through anyway. Clear and plain as day. If they ever decide to embrace the dark side  as Google has  then the FTC can file a lawsuit. The main thing is that if a company has a privacy policy, then they must stick to it . No matter what .  Google Chrome   G  oogle  Chrome's  a  lot  like  Stephen  King's  Christine,  a  1957  Plymouth Fury who loves it's owner a bit too much. She runs fast and hot and horny and like that hellspawn of a car, Chrome'll resist any temptation to tinker, mod or otherwise tighten her steel gaped maw because she thinks she can do the job better than you can. Besides, why should she take orders from some lowly peon, anyway ?  But I'll tell you how it all ends: It ends with the kid owner paying a high price for putting a speed demon ahead of his family. Chrome, like Christine, 'repairs' herself without permission a little too often for my liking .  She's  certainly  fast  though,  just  like  Christine.  But  she's  not  that  fast. And  there  are  some  serious  consequences  to  not  looking  under  the  hood. Here are a few gems that are considered 'benefits' to the end user by Google :  Each web url you type is sent to Google for the auto complete function - without telling you . Each file you download gets sent to the Big G too. They verify it against a master 'white list' then link your IP address to that file for months . Chrome checks every hour on the hour a list of blacklisted URLs to 'protect' you. Even opening Chrome tells Google where you are . When you logon to Google Gmail, they know everything about your browser: Tabs, History & all Bookmarks. Then they store it in one of those giant data centers of theirs . Will load a site before you finish the address .  Remember: If you are getting it for free, you are not the customer. You  are the product .   HOW WINDOWS 10 SPIES ON YOU  W indows 10 is the flagship of Microsoft's cloud-centric vision, and written under the hood is the hope that you'll one day depend on that cloud for more than  just  accessing  game  saves.  In  the  meantime,  Windows  10  is  not  a particularly  happy  operating  system  unless  it's  looking  online  for  drivers updates, patches and the like for your supposed benefit. It wants to put a smile on your face .  It  all  sounds  well  and  good  until  the  real  goal  becomes  apparent: looking for people who fit your own social circle and 'buying' habits and corralling everyone into a nice trackable pen... all without asking you first . Yes, I know. Microsoft's spying on the masses is hardly news. It's old hat and they're not the only ones doing it by a long shot. Every company you  give  money  to  channels  your  money  into  some  kind  of  marketing analysis  with  the  laser  sights  focused  somehow  on  you  and  your  stuff. Supermarkets like Winn-Dixie or Wal-Mart use them to such a laser-refined edge  that  they  know  when  your  daughter  is  pregnant  before  you  do.  It seems  like  a  decent  man  just  can't  escape  this  dragnet  without  going  off- grid  and  living  like  Jeremiah  Johnson   I've  tried  that  too,  and  failed spectacularly when I ran into a grizzly. More on that later  .  But  let's  not  fall  on  our  sword  just  yet.  You  can  in  fact  escape  any chance of law enforcement, governments or hackers getting a hold of that data, and that's our aim, as when your data is shared with governments or criminals  that  abuse  this  information,  well,  a  lot  of  nasty  surprises  come down the pike. Below is Microsoft's privacy statement and FAQ regarding the Diagnostics Tracking Service that comes with Windows 10 :   "As you use Windows, we collect performance and usage information that  helps  us  identify  and  troubleshoot  problems  as  well  as  improve  our products and services. We recommend that you select Full for this setting ."  Full data includes all Basic and Enhanced data, and also turns on advanced diagnostic features that collect additional data from your device, such as system files or memory snapshots, which may unintentionally include parts of a document you were working on when a problem occurred. This information helps us further troubleshoot and fix problems. If an error report contains personal data, we won’t use that information to identify, contact, or target advertising to you. This is the recommended option for the best Windows experience and the most effective troubleshooting .  Them's  Microsoft's  words,  not  mine,  and  note  also  that  only  on turn  Diagnostics  Tracking  Service  off  Enterprise  Edition  can  one  completely. Diagnostics Tracking Service consists of these files :  t elemetry.asm- windowsdefault.json  diagtrack.dll utc.app.json utcresources.dll  I  t's  not  likely  anyone  can  lockdown  Windows  10  enough  to  know  what they send or don't send either by laptop, PC or cell phone. As Ars Technica has found out, it's impossible to know why Windows 10 can't seem to stop talking to Microsoft's servers. Furthermore, Windows takes system files or memory  snapshots,  which  may  inadvertently  include  PARTS  OF  A DOCUMENT  YOU  WERE  WORKING  ON  when  a  problem  occurred. Note  that  Android  isn't  much  different.  It  has  a  similar  data  collection policy as does Mac OS .   Windows Privacy Settings  W indows 10 comes with some privacy settings turned on and some turned off. You can open up the Settings app and tic off what you like or don't, but know  that  they're  all  tied  to  your  Unique  Advertising  Identifier.  This Identifier is shared across other apps you use to allow Microsoft to spy on you and show you targeted ads in much the same way Wal-Mart does with your Sam's Club card. Corporations share this with each other and some sell it  outright  for  truckloads  of  cash  -  as  do  Search  engines  like  Bing  and Google. With Bing Search sitting there in the start menu, you can bet you rubber-flesh copy of Evil Dead that any search queries will not stay private. They'll be outed just as if you typed them into Bing itself. Even URLs get sent  to  Microsoft  for  validation  purposes  so  it  goes  without  saying  that some cellar doors should remain shut. Permanently .  Cortana  Cortana comes with Windows 10 automatically enabled after install. With this on you consent to Microsoft to grant a personal assistant of sorts, one that'll send data about your activities  including applications you run, GPS locations, browsing history  back and forth between your PC and Microsoft. It also includes your handwriting and voice imprint. You can disable these within  Speech,  Inking  &  Typing  within  Privacy  settings,  but  know  that Cortana isn't unique in this kind of privacy abuse, as Google Now and Siri do the same thing .  It should be obvious that this is a Very Bad Thing if you plan on doing anything  remotely  shady  on  the  Deep  Web.  If  you  absolutely  must  use Windows 10  which I strongly recommend you do not , you must -above all else- disable data logging . Here's how .  Disable Data Logging in Windows 10  A few of these fixes are a bit overkill, and if you're not sure what to do then stick to the "before installation" and "after installation" parts. DON'T start mucking about with the Powershell or the registry editor if you don't have at least a good idea of what you're doing though. This goes a bit farther than   merely being 'computer literate', obviously, but it illustrates how dangerous Windows really is to anonymity .  Before During Installation  Do not use Express Settings. Hit Customize, and make sure everything is turned off. It's strongly preferred that you use a local account with Windows 10 .  After Installation  Head to Settings > Privacy, and disable everything, unless there are some things  you  really  need.  While  within  the  Privacy  page,  go  to  Feedback, select Never in the first box, and Basic in the second box .  Head to Settings > Update and Security > Advanced Options > Choose  how updates are delivered, and turn the first switch off .  Disable Cortana by right clicking the Search bar icon .  Optional   Disable  web  search  in  Search  by  going  to  Settings,  and  turning off Search online and include web results .

HOW TO TELL IF YOUR PHONE IS TAPPED  A  phone  tapped  with  a  keylogger  is  a  bomb  waiting  to  go  off  since  the keylogger secretly records  and emails  every username and password you type in. Keyloggers aren't foolproof though. There are a few signs that may give clues that it isn't just your eyes seeing the screen .  1.  Unexplained Data Spikes - Are there any unusual spikes in the size of data being stored on the device? A lot of spyware programs pack data under the hood when you're not looking so it can be sent out later in bulk. Efficient  spy  payload  you  might  call  it.  My  Data  Manager  is  good  at monitoring  this  but  the  best  spyware  apps  will  evade  detection  since  the footprint is becoming ever smaller and the size of devices ever bigger .  2.  Unusual Phone Activity - Things like turning itself off or your lock  screen suddenly flashing on when you're not using it .  3.   Line  Noise  -  If  you're  in  the  Philippines  and  making  calls,  line stability is often terrible in provincial areas like Davao or Dumaguete. That means tons of noise. If you're in a first world nation, a constant stream of 'clicks' and 'beeps' can signal that someone, somewhere, is listening .  4.  Encrypted Emails - This can happen with poorly designed spyware, where  you  receive  odd  messages  that  make  no  sense  and  are  filled  with strange symbols. Spy applications are known to be buggy little critters and not  even  keyloggers  used  by  the  FBI  to  capture  keystrokes  of  mafia members are perfect .  5.   Odd  Files  in  Directories  -  It's  often  easy  to  see  spyware's  been installed on your device by just looking into a few subdirectories on your Android or iPhone. Often I find if I do a Google search for the name of the file,  someone  somewhere  has  likewise  found  this  exact  same  file.  Better   still is that they've opened a forum thread asking for help. Most of the time the  file  turns  out  to  be  quite  old.  This  saves  me  the  trouble  of  using expensive  forensic  software  like  Paraben's  Device  Seizure  or  UFED Physical Analyzer .   HOW TO STAY ANONYMOUS OVERSEAS... IN  ANY COUNTRY  Y ou've won the Powerball lottery and Uncle Sam awaits his cut. Problem is, so are some ugly long lost relatives who've managed to track you down and are now throwing down an epic guilt trip by sleeping in a van next to your mailbox. They're threatening to sleep down by the river too .  But that's not all . A guy named Eddie you remember from 3rd grade claims to have been your best friend. Except that he really wasn't. All you remember is that he gave  you  back  a  chewed  up  No.  2  pencil  that  looked  fresh  out  of  the hamster bin at the pet store .  You  need  to  get  away  from  this  heat.  Settle  down  somewhere  and  let things simmer down so you can think clearly. So you take aim and throw a dart at a world map on the wall and it lands smack dab in the middle of Zamboanga,  Philippines.  You  hop  on  Google  Earth  and  think,  my  my,  it looks  an  awful  lot  like  Maui.  Then  you  get  all  googly-eyed  at  those turquoise-watered beaches . Only it isn't quite that . There's a few terrorists walking around  real ones, not the old grannies the TSA likes to pull aside to interrogate . What could possibly go wrong ? To be honest, everything. You're a walking ATM in the Philippines and most of the locals know it, though by how much is debatable. But they all think you're rich. If you can afford a $1500 round-trip flight at the other end of the world well then you're as rich as Trump, by god. Now, not everyone is looking to rip you off, but the cab drivers certainly will and if you're in Zambooanga, watch out because that's the danger zone of all danger zones .   Americans, British citizens and Canadians alike are kidnapped routinely whenever  they  venture  too  far  into  Mindanao  territory.  Especially Zamboanga.  You'd  never  know  Zamboanga  houses  terrorists  because  it looks like Cebu and even Manila. How safe are those cities? Not very. For this reason you better get ready to lie your tail off before you ever set foot on a plane. Nice guys get killed over there. Quickly .  The first thing you need is a Fake Name. No way around it. You have to know  your  lies  inside  and  out  before  you're  airborne.  Then  you  need  to build a foundation to support this lie in the event you're discovered. We'll use Philippines as an example since that's where our dart landed and also because  it's  the  most  socially  networked  country  in  the  world,  bar  none. And I don't mean online .  1.   First  things  first,  make  up  an  email  account  using  first  name.last name@whereever.com.  The  name  should  obviously  be  fake  and  be something common to your country but not to your city. So if you're from Chinatown  you  better  pick  someplace  else.  John  Smith  is  perhaps  too obvious  for  most  tall  white  guys.  You  must  never  use  this  email  for  any connections to your real name because the aim here is to muddy the trail when anyone goes looking for the real you. They'll perform reverse-image searches,  phone  numbers,  white  pages,  and  maybe  even  Usenet  and  Ars Technica forums looking for your favorite Skype nicknames .  Never let this fake name connect to social media that's connected to the real you. Ever. As well, never use this name on the same IP address if you can help it. Use a VPN on a laptop specific to this fake name. Signup for Facebook if you must but realize that if you login from the same IP address as your Real You, Facebook will know it and will broadcast it to the world .  2 .  Women will almost always ask 'Is that your real name?' when they talk to you on Skype or some other chatroom. IF you have to you can tell them you  work  for  the  CIA  or  that  you're  the  next  Stephen  King  and  your publisher's threatened to string you up from the nearest tree if you reveal your  real  name.  If  anyone  online  asks  for  an  address,  sever  all communications immediately. They're likely either a stalker or an identity thief .   3  .   Listed  here  are  the  primary  things  that'll  give  up  the  goose:  airport luggage with your real name on it, business cards, laptops, tablets, iPhones with your real life pictures of you as a baby scattered about, and receipts. Anything in your wallet is a dead giveaway unless you have a prearranged DECOY wallet. A professional liar's wallet .  4 .  Never post old photos to a fake Facebook page. Any photos have to be made exclusively for that profile and nothing else lest they see old photos from your real Facebook page .  5 .  A problem area is check-in at the Marriot with a nice girl at your side, the same you just lied to. Only the cute emerald-green eyed girl at the desk asks for your real name. Do you lie? That breaks your cover. How about holding up an ID card? Nope again. She could easily ask you to pronounce it because not everyone there speaks perfect English. So now your goose is cooked. What to do, what to do .  W  ell  for  starters  you  can  reserve  a  room  by  phone  beforehand  and  not online.  She'll  ask  for  ID  no  matter  what  so  you  have  to  be  ready.  That means :  -  Preparing  a  business  card  beforehand  with  your  website  and  fake email and hand it to whoever asks. Just don't act nervous giving it out or you'll  find  out  like  Jim  Rockford  did  in  the  70s  that  bad  liars  are  an embarrassment to everyone involved, so be as supercool as Mr. Orange was in Reservoir Dogs .  - Put everything with your real ID in a safe in the room. Passports too  you did email yourself a copy in the event it's stolen, right? Those Pinoy trikes have a lot of sticky fingers . If she or he asks what's in the safe just say the next War and Peace manuscript. Gold to you but worthless to them .  - Only put your fake email on your luggage tags, not your real name . -  Duct-tape  your  passport  and  a  few  hundred  dollars  to  the  inside  of your  suitcase  lining.  Sew  it  back  up  so  the  baggage  handlers  don't  get suspicious .   - Ensure the 'location' feature of any phone is turned off. You shouldn't even bring a phone like this but for the sake of argument there was once a pinay who could see that was on E 85th and 3rd. She was a few blocks off but close enough to see where I was staying .   THE 10 BEST PHONES FOR ANONYMITY  A dmittedly, smartphones and burner phones can mean different things to different  people  depending  on  the  laws  of  their  respective  countries. Sometimes  a  burner  is  just  a  prepaid  phone  to  Joe  survivalist:  cheap  and good to go for when a natural disaster strikes. It'll get the job done. But that isn't the case with Fred the ex-CIA guy. The word smartphone is a bit of a misnomer too, like 'cat owner', because in reality the phone will own you if you get sloppy with your opsec .  One advantage that you want in a burner is being able to ditch it fast . Prepaid doesn't always fall into this category. So you need to be clear at the outset what you intend to do if the heat gets too hot. Plan B, to say .  Ditch it in the river? But ditching a Blackphone near to where you live may get you a longer sentence than actually handing it over to the police. For this reason it can really pay to invest in good mobile security.But first let's run through a couple of sloppy scenarios so you have an idea of what not to do .  S CENARIO 1: Bad Weed  All weed is bad if the opsec is bad. But let's say it isn't and we live in a perfect world where everything goes according to plan. Let's say you buy a burner  phone  that  Otto  the  bus  driver  recommended.  He  wants  a  bag  of weed. You commit to it. You buy it on the Deep Web and do so far away from home. You then dispose of it and consider that number 'burned'. Okay   then, that seems smart enough. Only what works for the Deep Web doesn't fly so straight on riskier outlets. Outlets like Craigslist . After getting that bag of reefer, you get a sales itch . You've smoked the bag yourself and figure to get another one only when you do you're as high as Tommy Chong and order another round using a non-burner with ties to your real number on the clearnet. You used a burner, true enough. But not an isolated burner. You accessed Tor using your real phone. Now you're not only at risk of an LE arrest, but the sheer number of certifiable psychos out there that make Quint from Jaws look like Pollyanna may just show up on your doorstep because you used a credit card over Tor. Not smart .  S CENARIO 2: Bad Dates, Good Dates  Burners  make  excellent  date  screeners  too.  No,  not  the  date  Indiana Jones came close to swallowing. I mean romantic dates. You save yourself tons of hassle using a burner in case the date goes sour and you believe you should part ways amicably  but the other party doesn't . A burner number thus can be untraceable, rendering any stalker a non-threat - as long as you didn't invite them to your house .  We're not interested in buying a burner for dating, obviously . We're interested in what it'd take to get away with buying something on the Black Market in a country that doesn't like Black Markets. You know, a control  thing,  the  peasants  vs.  The  Man.  So  as  you  flip  through  these phones  you  need  to  ask  yourself  if  you  can  handle  the  heat  that'd  come down if your identity happened to be compromised .  If you're a vendor of big crates of contraband  crates filled with those little green Toy Story aliens which are filled with, uh, green stuff , even the high-tech super spy Blackphone will be of little use since if you're pulled over by the cops, they're bound to bring a sniffer dog that'll give the a-okay to strip your car to the bone. They'll find something. They don't need the burner  though granted it'd be nice to see your customer list - any one of which will rat you out  .   Ditch your Glock before your encrypted phone. Getting caught with a handgun while dealing anything shady is like getting caught with one in Canada. They'll throw away the key after they throw you in a cell with snow gremlins . Cops love 'knock and talks'. That's when they just want to have a 'little chat' to get you to incriminate yourself. Never answer the door if they knock. If they have a warrant they'll likely come in anyway and bombard you with questions while they search. And on that topic, always, always make sure all your lights work before driving. Otherwise expect a 'talk' on the interstate . Get a legal side hustle, hobby, or side dream to shoot for. With straight-shooting friends. If you engage the cops for a living to feed your kids, say selling guns to rival gang members or even those granny biker gangs from Fury Road, you'll do serious time sooner or later. Lady luck favors those with more to lose . Never, ever break two laws at the same time . Bragging can get you 20 years due to this little thing called 'gossip' - your uncle Spanky, your siblings, your girlfriend. More on the finer details of Dark Personas in later chapters . If you're the best business in town then people will talk. Your name will be passed around to undesirables. Burner phones cannot prevent this .   BLACKPHONE  D esigned by an entrepreneur, a technology expert, a cryptographer and a former  Navy  SEAL,  the  Blackphone  does  just  what  it  claims  to  do.  It protects you from the prying eyes of the NSA and a few more of it's Big Data  brothers.  Unfortunately  this  protection  comes  at  a  high  price:  $629. Not cheap. But for rock-solid security you could do a lot worse .  It uses PrivatOS, an operating system that gives you 100% control over who or what an app talks to. Another plus is the preventative measures that kick in when you power it on: Protection from hackers and identity thieves or  just  some  back-alley  kid  whose  eying  your  phone  in  Wendy's  like Gollum's fishing buddy .   T HE SPECS ARE AS FOLLOWS :  S CREEN SIZE: 4.7”  1280 * 720   Display Technology: 4.7" IPS HD Technology: Capacitive >4 point multi-touch  C AMERA  Sensor size main camera 8 MP AF Type of camera flash: Flash LED   Front camera 5MP FF  C ONNECTIVITY  Single micro-SIM slot Bluetooth Class 4.0 LE Wi-Fi 802.11b g n Micro USB 3.5mm audio jack  H ARDWARE  Processor: Quad-core 2GHz System on Chip  SoC   Platform: NVIDIA Tegra 4i  N  EED  a  good  camera  to  give  to  a  scout  in  enemy  territory?  Try  the Blackphone's 8 megapixel rear cam. It's not top of the line but then the front cam  is  5  megapixels  and  16GB  internal  storage,  so  it's  sufficient  for surveillance work. The other plus is the CPU: an Nvidia Tegra 4i chip .  As a rule most cameras aren't terribly friendly to privacy to begin with,  considering the metadata available within the images .  Then  there's  the  GPS  stamps.  But  the  device  has  to  be  compromised before it can be abused. If it's compromised, anything else you do on the device is no longer private anyway .  So how anonymous is it? The short answer is very anonymous . But like I  said,  it's  pricey,  but  at  what  cost  security?  To  that  I'd  say  that  as  far  as anonymity goes all the apps bundled with the device  if you bought them individually  would cost you more than the phone itself. Things like :  - an included 1 year membership to Silent Suite - A 1-year "Friends and Family" Silent Circle Subscription - 1 year of encrypted web browsing from Disconnect, 1GB month - 1 year of secure cloud backup from SpiderOak, 5GB month   I T ALSO HAS the ability to remote wipe. The PrivatOS got this one right . Granted,  you  have  to  create  an  account  for  this  to  work.  But  it's  like holding a handheld nuclear launch code device. If your phone's been stolen, if you've loaned it to Harry whose been suspiciously absent from meetings for the last few days, or your sister 'borrowed' it and loaned it to her best friend's golf partner's brother-in-law, then fire and forget. Remote Wipe is a dream option .  There's also the Kismet  Smarter  WiFi  Manager .  This  app  memorizes your trusted networks by triangulating cell towers within the area. It comes preconfigured  to  make  any  kind  of  spoofing  of  your  network  very  very difficult. If you travel out of any established circle of 'trusted networks', the app turns off WiFi and your MAC address .  Since the app can turn off WiFi that means you won't be broadcasting your  home  network  name  to  every  Joe  Schmo  within  earshot.  Lots  of random  attacks  by  bored  hackers  and  script  kiddies  tend  to  undo  people who  don't  care.  If  they  know  your  network's  name  they  can  spoof  it  and begin running all kinds of scripts that sniff every byte of your traffic. That leads a trail to your front door .  If you bite the bullet and purchase this, check out the Disconnect Secure Wireless service, a VPN that encrypts everything you do online. What this app does is send all traffic via proxy to kill any tracking data inserted into, say, Supercookies. One click and done .  Two other must-have apps come preinstalled. They are : - Silent Phone - and Silent Text  I WAS skeptical of both of these until I learned that the designer was none other than Phil Zimmermann of the original PGP encryption suite. So I trust the  crypto  behind  it.  Any  video  or  chat  session  can  give  you  encrypted messages. Better still is the 'Burn Notice' function, a Silent Text feature that allows users to decide how long a message is available before deleting it from both the sending and the receiving device. According to designers at Silent  Circle,  the  burn  timer  works  differently  for  the  sender  and  the receiver of the message :  - For the sender, the timer will start as soon as the message is sent .   -  For  the  person  receiving  the  message,  the  timer  will  start  once  the  message as been displayed on Silent Text's conversation screen .  These are the highlights . Unfortunately,  opsec  isn't  a  product  one  can  buy.  It's  a  24 7  mindset where  90%  of  the  reasons  you'll  get  caught  have  more  to  do  with  your offline self than anything you do online. Most newcomers to the philosophy of opsec aren't able to do this because we humans are wired to trust rather than doubt .  All of this is not to suggest the Blackphone is perfect. It's not. In fact when it debuted in 2014, a fair share of bugs had come out and more than one  site  pointed  it  out.  Remember  though  that  whenever  these  issues  are found, they are fixed promptly .   BLACKPHONE 2  B lackphone 2  Far from being a 'burner' phone that you'd toss away, the Blackphone's successor just may be the most unhackable smartphone to ever come along. But unhackable to whom ?  That's the million dollar question you need to answer before you plop down  over  $700  bucks  for  one.  Are  you  a  secret  agent?  Double  agent? Hacker? NSA escapee? Or are you just a businessman on his way to China who needs something hack-proof ?  Right out of the gate you'll notice it's based around a Google operating system.  You're  shaking  your  head,  I  know.  So  was  I.  Avoid  Google.  Full stop.  Go  with  something  like  Gentoo  Linux  with  SELinux  if  you  want  a secure smartphone. And you're right. If you need serious security to avoid any  state  surveillance,  that's  the  golden  route.  In  fact  if  you've  got  an alphabet agency after you, don't use a smartphone at all. But for everyone else out there whose last name isn't Snowden, read on .  The  phone  itself  is  a  miniature  version  of  the  black  slab  in  2001:  A Space  Odyssey,  the  one  that  killed  the  entire  team.  Monolithic  and  eerie looking,  the  specs  are  a  decent  upgrade  from  it's  younger  brother,  but  as we'll see the real meat and potatoes is the ease of use it gives you .  Display Screen: 5.5inches, 1080p LCD CPU: octacore Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 RAM: 3GB Storage: 32GB; microSD slot Operating system: Silent OS 2 built on Android 5.1.1 Camera: 13MP rear camera, 5MP front-facing camera   Connectivity: LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS Dimensions: 152 x 76 x 7.9mm Weight: 165g   T HE GOOD :  Multitasking:  A  dream!  The  Snapdragon  615  handled  everything  I threw at it except for games, and there's little sense in those since that's not what you're buying the device for .  C HARGE : Lasted me almost a full day, but the way I bounce around apps drained  a  lot  of  juice  from  the  device,  so  I  had  to  use  it  sparingly  to  not have to charge it every day .  U SEABILITY : There was little visual difference from stock Android, with no  penalties  in  the  Google  Play  Store.  What's  available  on  my  Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 is available here .   S ECURITY : The Stock Android appearance is misleading. There's tons of security settings under the hood for you though. You don't even need the Security Center app to hold your hand either  though you can if you want . You  can  set  any  app  to  only  have  access  to  location  data,  the  web,  or nothing. Up to you .  It reminded me a lot of the Cyanogen OS , which I highly recommend if  you're unfamiliar with it. A few of the goodies are as follows :  Define 'spaces' where Google cannot tread. Within this space, it is 'jailed' in a sense, and one space cannot share data with another. I had one for my contacts, work data, writing docs, taxes and email, with each being in their own 'space' and not able to reach over the fence, so to speak . Manage which apps live in each space . Quarantine any app if you only want to test drive it. That way if a catastrophe ensues, the damage is contained. Think of what the bomb disposal guys do with the bomb. Similar effect of running a suspicious app in a VM  virtual machine  . Security updates are quick and easy to install . Though pricey, you pay for the software's development and ecosystem which fuel the many features it has. Sure, an iPhone is a snuggier fit for the average Joe than this phone, and as the hardware is faster and sleeker, it's easy to learn, and access to the iOS system is unmatched. But then the Blackphone never claims to take the place of the iPhone for end users anyway, and it's not a patch on the Blackphone if what you really need is security or anonymity . According to Silent Circle they had a high level of cooperation from Qualcomm, and are working on having a fully audited baseband. But for now they treat baseband as a hostile router and encrypt Silent Phone voice, video and text before it goes out over radio .   T HE BAD :  WiFi: 4G speeds were better than I expected, but the WiFi was laggy. On some days it was more laggy than others. It wasn't as bad what you'd get in Manila but considering the price I expected better. Not a deal breaker though . Encrypted messages & calls are only for Silent Phone users, though you can call others who don't own a Blackphone. Just not encrypted calls . Rear camera  13-megapixel  shoots dull indoor pictures. Outdoors is much better . Price is $799  US . If you're not the privacy-minded type, you'll likely buy something else . If 'Google' is on the front screen, it's usually a red flag .  T HE UGLY  Having lived in Niagara Falls I could write a book on my encounters with Toronto police and how invasive and downright horrifying it can be to get  a  snarky  one  on  a  rainy  day,  double  that  for  a  border  officer.  That snarkiness gets worse if you get sent to secondary inspection. The kicker is that this is just the phone to get you there all the quicker if you take the bait they'll drop - which they always do .  Visually, it's a remarkable little security device. You can bet the ranch they'll  make  a  remark  or  two  about  this  little  black  beauty  as  merely possessing it may ruffle a few of their federal feathers the wrong way .  Investigation going on? You'll experience heightened scrutiny. What're you  hiding?  Border  guards  on  terrorist  alert?  Shakedown  time.  I  see  cars turned  inside  out  as  I  drive  into  Buffalo,  NY  from  Canada  all  the  time, though I see many more if it's a national holiday .  If  I  were  driving  into  Canada,  Mexico  or  Europe,  I'd  stick  the Blackphone  in  the  most  innocent,  ridiculous  looking  Hello  Kitty  phone covering that I could lay my hands on, or even put it's electronic innards into a rival phone's chassis so as to look as boring as possible to any border guard. These guys put up with a lot of juvenile acts every day and the last   thing  you  want  is  to  whip  out  a  pricey,  hardened,  hackle-raising  security phone if you need to be low-profile .  They want to see a phone like this. It makes the hot summer day all the  more bearable and giving you a hard time is the icing on the cake .   BOEING'S 'BLACK' PHONE OF SELF-  DESTRUCTION  I II. Boeing's 'Black' Phone of Self-Destruction  B EFORE  YOU  WHIP out  your  wallet,  know  that  this  phone  cannot  be purchased  by  end  users  like  you  and  I.  But  if  you're  an  employee  with security clearance, that means you've already consented to have any online actions monitored anyway so it's likely game over before you even fire up this baby .  The insides are nothing special : - a 1.2 Ghz Cortex CPU, a 4.3 screen and average 1590 battery. What's unusual is the 'trusted module' satellite-uplink ability along with hardware- designed  storage  for  encrypted  data.  It's  pretty  neat  if  you  can  get  it  but becomes outdated rather quickly .  Then there's the 'Pure Secure' security design by Boeing which resists all forms of spoofing or modding - which means no root access. So much for making it non-trackable to the NSA .   T  HE  SPECS  MAY  SEEM  LACKING  but  for  a  government  employee there's probably acceptable specs for whatever the government wants him to do.  For  all  we  know  they  won't  come  in  contact  with  the  internet  at  all. Maybe email and productive apps like databases and NSA slideshows. Who knows .  Side note : At the other end is the transparency for a big name corporation. Take a company like Lockheed. Now think of an outfit like Northrup Grumman, a leading  global  security  company  that  provides  products  in  unmanned systems, cybersecurity, C4ISR, and other slick services .  Would it be a terrible thing for an intelligence agency to intercept some lackey at Northrup who conspired with a Lockheed employee to send a text to the Peruvian embassy? Maybe he offered to exchange some interesting maps for the secret of ceviche? Well maybe he did. Maybe he didn't .  Nonetheless,  whenever  you  get  a  phone  this  specialized,  it's  almost always used for other big hardware that no one else has. If it's stolen, most of the time they can't use it .   But I thought you should know of it in case you're wandering around the Boeing plant one day and happen to see some fuzzy-mustached manager named  Bucky  Goldstein  yakking  into  one  of  these.  Know  that  he's  got  a good piece of tech in his hands that he's not likely to loan out - but no way is he evading his Big Brother the NSA .   BLACKBERRY  I V.  BlackBerry  B LACKBERRY MADE headlines last year when it acquired Secusmar, the German-based voice-data encryption company with a penchant for waging war  against  well-funded  eavesdroppers  like  the  NSA.  Prior  to  the acquisition,  they'd  worked  together  to  pad  BlackBerry  devices  with  high security for a few high-profile politicians, one of which was Angela Merkel .  Yep, that Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany . The  same  Merkel  that  the  NSA  spied  on  and  who  later  rightly  told  Obama off by phone, BlackBerry to BlackBerry .   Notifications :  Android  has  a  far  better  notification  system  than  other devices. Anonymity programs like Orbot and pretty much any security app rely on notifications for mission-critical network issues .  K EYBOARD : Hands down, Blackberry offers the best typing experience on the market. They are at the top of a very short list of makers who design physical-keyboard  phones  these  days.  In  fact  I've  noticed  my  words-per- minute  increased  quite  drastically  the  more  I  used  it.  This  may  be insignificant  in  a  dangerous  country  like  Iran  or  Zamboanga,  Philippines, but while most average Joes want some level of security on their phone, it usually comes second to features and usability .  F UTURE CUSTOMERS & Support : After spending a month researching the  BlackBerry  market  I  can  tell  you  that  I  was  taken  aback  when  I discovered  how  much  they've  cut  back  on  marketing  and  administration. They dropped from almost $400 million to $200 million. People who don't follow markets might think that's par for the course, but it isn't. That's big bucks. Huge bucks. In fact it's almost as if BlackBerry doesn't want to grow.   And they need to grow but with these kind of budget slashes it's unlikely many new customers will be forthcoming in future years .  So what does this mean for security ? It means patches to exploits and security holes will be filled sparingly, if at all. A bad thing. The silver lining is that, much like a few non-Windows systems, BlackBerry may simply cease to be interesting to most hackers out there. There simply won't be enough people using them to justify exploits or hacktivism  or  extortion-by-virus  dry  runs.  But  that  isn't  nearly  enough  to make up for the bad .  There's also the fact that much of the top sales come from South Africa. For the record I don't think that it's CIA operatives either. More than likely it's teenagers being able to talk incognito without fear of the parents butting into their business. Teenagers who'd rather use a physical keyboard than a touch screen. Teenagers that use BB7 phones rather than the BB10s. The handwriting  on  the  wall  seems  to  be  that  within  5  years  we'll  see BlackBerry folding up the big tent and heading elsewhere .  As to Blackberry's security abilities in the here and now, read on to the  next section .   BLACKBERRY SECURITY  I  f  you're  an  Android  user  you  may  wonder  just  how  secure  BlackBerry really is. What makes the network itself more secure than Android ?  Well the truth of it is that security is tough to implement and tougher to stay on top of. The king of the fortress must protect every entry point in the entire  estate,  while  any  foreign  invader  only  needs  one  vulnerability  to exploit. That's because they only have to get lucky once. Security even on BlackBerry is only as strong as its weakest link. That's you , my friend .  It's  not  entirely  different  than  electricity  or  a  home  invader,  for  both follow the path of least resistance. But if you lock down your fortress with airtight security and fill your moat to the brim with piranha yet forget about the  secret  entrance  leading  up  from  the  sewers,  well  there  goes  your security  plan.  Right  out  the  window.  The  best  guard  in  the  world  can't defend against an arrow to the back of the neck .  To it's credit, BlackBerry has something called COPE , which stands for Company  Owned  Personally  Enabled  Devices.  You  can  read  why  this  is good security elsewhere but suffice it to say its what your security needs are that counts .  A  friend  of  mine  in  Korea  says  he  as  well  as  his  family  all  receive malware-phishing texts on a daily basis. Usually they're the kind with fake links,  but  look  like  the  genuine  article.  If  you  click  on  the  link  using  an Android phone, your screen gets sent to the thief. Now he can see it all. He says  this  is  a  widespread  problem  in  South  Korea,  but  only  on  Android phones. Not so in a BlackBerry .   JAILBROKEN PHONES  O ne of the biggest differences between Android, iPhone and BlackBerry is that BlackBerry is designed with good security from the first layer on up at the hardware level . For many others such hardened security begins at the app level - the surface of an operating system. If you jailbreak your phone then that trust-module is broken and any hacker worth his salt can, on his worst  day,  grab  data  housed  between  the  operating  system  level  and  the application level but only if you don't take steps to secure it yourself .  That's the tradeoff with a jailbroken phone. You get more flexibility and convenience but at the cost of security. It works the other way around, too. With  more  security  comes  less  flexibility.  Take  your  BBM  messages,  for instance. It's very difficult, unlike on Android, for contacts such as those in an address book to be sent elsewhere without your approval. You're the one in charge of who you converse with. Deny them or accept them. Can you deny the government ?  Yes, you can, by using whatever standard of encryption you desire on a BES server. That said, you can be compelled by a judge to fork over your password as is the case with many who were arrested for tax evasion. The way around this is to never allow your IP address or any other identifying information about you to find its way into the hands of an adversary. And these  days,  learning  how  to  hide  your  IP  address  is  the  kindergarten equivalent of learning the alphabet .   ENCRYPTING FILES ON BLACKBERRY  T here exists several different encryption apps you can use on BlackBerry for anonymous messaging. My personal favorite is PGP, but then its an app that's had over a decade of development. Thought it works beautifully on BlackBerry, there may come a day when you simply want to encrypt files natively without the help of any third party apps. Here's how :  - From your home screen, swipe down - Choose settings, security and privacy - encryption - From here you can choose any of these : Set Device-Encryption to On Set Media Card Encryption to On Set your device's password  required   You will find that it's not possible to select files folders by themselves to  encrypt but rather the entire device media card .   DECRYPTING FILES  C hoose Settings, then Encryption  Move slider to Media or Device from On to Off Enter the password you set previously Important : Know that implementing the above gives you an encryption key native to your phone so that if you erase this device then the key gets erased  as  well  .  If  that  happens,  any  data  that  was  on  this  device  is unaccessible without that key. To put this in perspective, if you lose your BlackBerry but still retain your microSD card that has your encrypted files  encrypted  by  the  system  that  is  now  in  the  hands  of  someone  else ,  you cannot get your files on the microSD back either, even if you use a new BlackBerry. This is linked to the system password on the device itself .  The following apps come highly recommended should you need a third-  party app that encrypts individual files :  Keepsafe Photo Vault – Hide Pictures And Videos  Titan Files  Max Hide & Encrypt  Secret Keeper  O ne thing to note is that when you encrypt your entire device, any caller's name won't appear once the device goes into a locked state. You'll see their   number  but  not  their  identity.  The  reason  for  this  is  because  the  device memory  becomes  partially-encrypted  with  each  instance  of  unlocking  the device. Some users choose to encrypt only the microSD card for this very reason .  Once  again,  let  me  restate  that  wiping  your  device  will  render  the microSD  card  UNRECOVERABLE  unless  it  is  decrypted  first.  The password  is  only  used  to  encrypt  the  key,  and  the  key  is  randomly generated.  This  is  why  the  entire  device  doesn't  have  to  be  re-encrypted when you change your password .   HOW TO DISABLE AUTOMATIC OS UPDATES ON  BLACKBERRY 10  I f there is one thing I've always hated about operating systems out of the box, it's automatic updates. I loathe them. Android is notorious for this and it was the first thing I changed when buying a Samsung Galaxy tablet a few years back .  BlackBerry isn't much different and many encryption users simply don't like auto-updates since they tend to break personalized settings and heaven only knows what else. Where security is concerned, you want full control over your device since one update can destroy your anonymity .  Often  whenever  a  new  update  is  released,  if  the  device  is  WiFi- connected  the  update  is  downloaded  in  the  background  and  installed automatically. Then the user is suddenly asked to restart. Not good .  He  could  be  in  an  important  business  meeting  in  the  middle  of  a presentation  when  this  happens.  Or  on  a  stakeout  and  get  the  update  just when the crap is about to hit the fan. Not fun for a device that brags about being the best around at security when it never asks you for permission to start with .  So here's how we turn it off : - Choose Settings, then Software Updates. Look towards the bottom of  the Updates page and choose Options .  - In the Options page, the slider is present to Enable Disable Updates.  Choose according to your needs .   OLDER & GENERIC BURNER PHONES  AKA  CHEAP PHONES   N eed an emergency phone? Then you don't need an expensive Blackphone. Give  the  TracFone  a  spin.  They  own  Net10  &  StraightTalk,  both  prepaid carriers, and make a few 'bare bones' phones that'll do the job just fine. The trade off is limited support. We'll discuss those at length along with a few phones I've used that aren't really phones at all. That means no GPS, 3G or even LTE. But you get a much longer-lasting battery. There's pros and cons to every one of them .  If on the other hand you need something for 'special' emergencies, then  GPS is the last thing you want. Here's why .  Let's  say  a  cell  tower  pings  your  burner  phone's  location  every  15 minutes  or  so,  then  saves  the  geolocation  data  and  time  stamp.  A determined adversary might be able to query events where phone A  your super secret prepaid phone  was within 30 feet of a not-so-secret phone B for 6 hours or so, with work driving time factored into it too. How do we prevent this from happening ?  The simple way is to never leave Phone A powered on anywhere near your real-identity phone  phone B . In fact secret phone A should always, without question, remain stored at a distant location even if it's in a storage unit with your real name front and center .  As long as the battery's taken out . This battery only gets removed if you need to 'go dark'. That's when the real  phone  is  far  away  from  you  and  believe  me  there's  far  less  risk  this way. If you neglect to do this, an adversary with sufficient resources  pretty much anyone with a shiny badge these days  can pinpoint both signals and correlate them to your real identity .   At any rate, as we go through these cheap phones, remember what your security needs are and that no amount of cash is too much for good security. You get what you pay for in this life, and good lawyers are more expensive that good phones and good opsec .   NOKIA LUMIA 520  T his phone makes a great burner phone as it's so cheap. Being a Windows phone, you'll have to tweak it to whatever anonymity services you require. Add to that there's a mile-long list at the end in the next section where I cover anonymity apps. The bonus is that it's a steal at under $50 bucks on Amazon.  When  searching  for  a  phone,  I  typically  read  the  1-star  reviews first to gauge whether it's a deal killer or not. Now for the stats .  Cons - Not all that glitters is gold. In other words, don't expect the gold standard  for  such  a  small  price.  This  phone  is  lousy  for  hikers  on  the Appalachian trail in need of good GPS, but for cloak and dagger purposes it fits the bill nicely .  Odd Camera - Flash is non-existent and there's no front camera either. Photo quality is also quite poor for those photographer-tourists who always seem to wander into North Korea .   Limited Customization - The 520 doesn't sport too much in the way of separate  profiles  with  different  settings.  I  like  to  keep  my  work  profile separate from my home profile, with each having a distinct ring tone  my ghost  phone  has  no  volume  setting .  The  volume  settings  on  the  Lumia refused  to  allow  me  to  make  the  two  distinct.  Mind  you  it  does  offer volume, just not for many profiles .  App  Inferiority  -  You  get  what  you  pay  for.  The  many  apps  for  the Lumia 520 are quite humble next to what's offered for Android. And that's the  silver  lining.  Modern,  whiz-bang  apps  found  on  Android  often  have trackers that are difficult to disable and like to 'phone home' far too often for my liking .  Moto G - Prepaid Version  A nother great burner phone. It uses Android and comes at under $100 at Amazon .  Specs : 4.5 inch 720p HD TFT display Quad-core 1.2GHz processor with 450MHz UMTS HSPA+, CDMA EVDO Rev A 5MP rear camera, plus front facing camera, 8GB Internal Memory   T his is the one you want if your on a budget. When I first test drove this I wanted to see if I could use it as a WiFi mini-tablet. I skipped activation and ended  up  giving  them  no  info  at  all  and  it's  worked  fine  ever  since.  Just swipe  off-screen  and  go  into  options,  then  turn  airplane  mode  on.  After doing this it didn't access any mobile network and never prompted me at all, so I just set wifi to on or off manually .  It's  a  nice  little  mini  tablet.  Good  for  privacy.  Security?  You  can  do better, and a Samsung Galaxy Tab she ain't. But it has decent resolution and can be used with Flixter, Amazon App store, Google Play and even games. You'll get two free texts with Verizon so you'll know if it's working or not .   MOTOROLA EX-431G  T  he  next  excellent  burner  is  the  Motorola  EX-431G,  a  TracFone  that comes  with  a  keyboard  and  triple-plus  minutes  for  life.  The  price  varies between twenty and forty dollars and like before, you get what you pay for. This is a feature phone and not an Android phone. That means no unlimited talk, text and internet, so if you want a plan like that then you'll need to use their sister company, StraightTalk. The stats are as follows :  Full QWERTY Keyboard Double Triple Minutes  depends on model   2MP Camera MP3 Player MicroSD Card  up to 32GB   Mobile Web Bluetooth Hands-Free Speaker FM Radio 500 Entry Phone Book Voicemail, Caller ID, Call Waiting , Alarm Clock   MOTOROLA MOTO G  3RD GENERATION   A  bit  expensive  for  a  burner  phone,  but  at  $179,  I  peg  this  little  phone mainly for those needing sanity over anonymity, like parents with kids since it's waterproof, but can also be great for grandmas, bathrooms with soapy floors and cars in need of better communications. It's not for special ops or survival scenarios .   S pecs :  Advanced water resistance 13 MP camera which includes a color-balancing dual LED Flash 5" HD display; Brilliant display quality and the strength of Corning Gorilla Glass Quad core processing power in a great value product 5MP rear camera with a VGA front facing camera 24hr battery performance with a 2470mAh battery   Expandable memory; Slot for an microSD card with 32 GB capacity . 4G LTE Speed; Browse, stream music, watch video, and play games at blazing speed .  T he display isn't the best and 1GB is pretty minimal but it handles like a much more expensive device and as expected Android didn't cough up any problems. The camera too plays nice with the owner and since it ships with IPX7 - which allows for half an hour submersion in water w no damage - you could do a lot worse. One major con though is that the battery is NOT removable.  Remember  what  we  said  about  the  NSA  being  able  to  track phones with the battery still inside .   MOTOROLA I355 RADIO CELL PHONE  T  his  is  the  survivalist's  dream  phone.  It's  cheap  at  around  $15  at  most places like ebay, and fast. It also supports Direct Talk. Direct Talk in case you’re  wondering  is  when  a  phone  has  the  ability   like  many  Nextel phones  to grant 2-way radio chat, effectively bypassing the cell towers . It needs  a  sim  card  to  be  able  to  do  this,  but  the  sim  card  doesn't  actually connect to a network tower .  The  older  DirectConnect  involved  two  phones  connecting  to  a  cell tower  and  from  there  all  messages  were  relayed  to  wherever.  But  Direct Talk  bypasses  cell  towers  completely.  This  came  about  because  many Nextel  customers  found  their  jobs  bringing  them  to  areas  that  required walkie-talkies. This solved that problem nicely .   P oints to Note  T he range varies but 3 miles out is not uncommon. Believe it or not, having a good antenna  that is, extending it  helps this range considerably .  Incognito one-on-one calls are supported, even group calls. You can even have twenty users participate in a group call if their close enough. This is ideal for everyone but hunters since the 'blip' sound is fairly loud . The i355 was once one of Nextel's babies on the iDen network  now defunct and why they're so darned cheap now . To use a sim from a different network you must have an unlock code which is about twenty bucks or so from an online 'unlock shop '.  T his isn't to say the i355 is the only DirectTalk phone. There are others that support it, mostly Nextel phones .  Nextel ic402 Nextel ic502 Nextel ic602   Nextel ic902 Nextel i275 Nextel i315 Nextel i325 Nextel i335 Nextel i355 Nextel i365 Nextel i425 Nextel i455 Nextel i560 Nextel i570 Nextel i580 Nextel i615 Nextel i670 Nextel i760 Nextel i776 Nextel i850 Nextel i870 Nextel i880   SAMSUNG S150G  TRACFONE   N ext up is the Samsung S150G, also a TracFone. In the also-bought section at  Amazon,  you  probably  saw  like  I  did  that  some  phones  advertised  as 'Prepaid' aren't so cheap. The price sometimes doesn't justify what you get as you don't need to spend $50 dollars for a burner phone. This Tracphone though can be had for as little as $10 bucks. Not quite the i355, but then few are .   O n the Samsung SGH-S150G you’ll find a large keypad with large buttons that  make  dialing  numbers  and  typing  text  messages  easy.  And  that's  a lifesaver in a hard storm with 50MPH winds. The specs are as follows :  TracFone Double Minutes features an LCD color display Auto redial Keypad lock Alarm clock Phonebook with up to 1,000 entries Polyphonic ringtones Talk Time: up to 15 hours Standby Time: 10.4 days Includes battery, charger, activation card and services guide   DISASTER PREPAREDNESS  I  bought  one  of  the  aforementioned  pre-paid  phones  in  2015  in  Ontario, Canada with cash just to see if I could be truly anonymous in doing so. Wal- Mart was the buying place and I knew there'd be security cam footage that could identify me as the buyer, both in the store, in the parking lot and on the streetlight cams .  If I'd wanted to I could've rigged a fairly good disguise that'd throw off a  decent  investigator  I  suppose  but  I  wasn't  engaged  in  anything  shady  sigh  so I just waltzed in like a wino off the street. When I activated it at a nearby college, something struck me as it began to rain .  These types of phones are ideal for being disaster-prepared as the charge outlasts  fully-fledged  smartphones  and  tablets  by  a  country  mile.  If  you want some extra insurance, you could even buy a couple of additional $10 phones to get the extra batteries  what they'd cost on most sites anyway  .  In  a  looting  and  flood  situation  where  you've  got  gangs  roaming  the streets  and  breaking  into  BestBuy  to  steal  LCD  TVs   a  la  Katrina ,  these simple cheap burners could be life-savers for your entire family. Better yet, several  families  joined  at  the  hip  and  coordinating  security  and  ration procedures might save everyone involved from ending up like those poor Joes stranded at the New Orleans Superdome during Hurricane Katrina .  Another  reason  to  have  several  is  the  FCC.  They  require  that  all  cell phones must have 911-call ability even if you're not with any carrier. For this reason I rarely throw out my old devices. Many can still dial 911, with the Emergency Dialer usually located at the bottom of the locked phone .   P oints to Note  You may find yourself stranded in a hurricane. Or a civil war. Voice may be down, so you need to learn how to text or get a UHF & GMRS radio to contact family and loved ones. Cell phone companies usually install just enough equipment to handle normal peak usage. So if a large number of people all try to talk at once it can cause a lot of issues even when everything is working optimally . When the Cincinnati bridge collapsed in 2007, cell users could only initially call for help. After a few minutes cell phone voice calls were either too congested or blocked for use by emergency personnel. However, text messaging still worked, even though there were some delays . Data travels on a different network than voice calls and because of its nature, can be retransmitted by the network until it finally reaches your phone. So, even in the event of a brief data interruption, the network will continually try to send your text messages until they reach your cell phone .  This makes it ideal for emergency notification, especially in the initial  stages of an emergency .  If you are trying to get a message to a group of people, set up a group  email list on your email service so you can broadcast instructions .  Yes,  I  realize  that  your  internet  service  might  be  down  but  you  could even set this up on your email service right on your cell. Also realize that nearly ALL cell phones now have a way to receive a text message unless they are over 10 years old. Yep, a lot of people think they don't have that service,  but  they  do.  There  are  limitations  on  some  of  the  cell  phones  in getting messages of course. Some are limited to about 100 characters so if you're sending a broadcast, you'll want it to be short and precise .  Anyway, you can build all sorts of scenarios as well as your own color  alert system to help get the message out in a short number of characters .  Personal Note   I n 2015 I decided to buy a handful of these cheap prepaid phones, only I swore  to  myself  I'd  keep  them  activated  in  case  something  Really  Bad happened  which later did  and I needed something other than my usual cell phone.  I  found  that  if  you  add  twenty  bucks  or  so  to  them  every  few months, they'll stay active and give you a nice stack of 'emergency' minutes as long as you don't go hog wild with talk time. I keep one in every vehicle as  well  as  a  charger  in  case  I'm  on  a  trip  without  my  cell.  For  strict anonymity though this comes up a bit inadequate. But it will give you a line of  communication  with  the  wife,  kids  or  other  family  members  who  you may need to call in dire situations .  Each of these phones is connected to a different carrier's network, like Sprint and Verizon, in case one of them goes down in an Armageddon-like scenario.  As  stated  before,  these  prepaid  phones  have  amazingly  more battery-charge   and  can  withstand  drops spills   than  your  average smartphone .  Craigslist  T he value of Craigslist is heavily dependent on your region, but some very nice phones can be acquired using it .  One thing though. Always always carry  a  burner  when  you  deal  with anyone  on  Craigslist  and  especially  when  buying  expensive  items  like gaming laptops, cars or rare firearms .  Come armed if you can. Let a friend know where you're going. Not that you're doing anything shady, but you've no idea if you're meeting the next Evil Dead fan who wants to pick up where the cabin demons left off. The level  of  evil  out  there  is  escalating.  You  want  to  leave  as  few  digital breadcrumbs  as  possible.  Never  let  strangers  know  you've  got  a  nice  gun filled basement with a safe full of cash and i355 phones .  National Guard Sergeant Jim Vester from Indianapolis was killed while trying to complete a Craigslist transaction for an iPad. It was a setup from the  start  over  what  amounted  to  $400.  Such  a  tragedy  may  have  been averted if he'd arranged to meet in a public place for the transaction. Sadly, he did not. RIP .   If you must use this service however, when posting the ad, do not allow email contact. Just put your contact info in the ad body itself. i.e. the phone number and specify calls only .  This  eliminates  scams  and  weeds  out  the not so serious buyers as well as stupid "Is the BBQ pit in the background for sale?" and "what lowest price take for?" emails .  Scams  A  nd  beware  of  the  Paypal eBay Craigslist  scam.  It  goes  like  this.  They send you a fake email that looks like a PayPal email would. You then click the link in said email, which then directs you to a website that looks exactly like PayPal, only it isn't actually PayPal. You enter your username password in said website and viola, they now have your login info .  This scam has been around for years. A safer bet is to stick with thrift stores  and  yard  sales.  Burners  are  one  thing  but  for  selling  weapons  and related stuff, you're probably better off using Armslist.com .  There's  another  scam,  too.  Avoid  any  craigslist  buyer seller  of  costly items  that  cannot  meet  you  face  to  face.  I've  met  dozens  of  scammers buying  and  selling  fast  cars  and  other  expensive  items.  Only  deal  with locals  who  have  cash  in  their  hands,  ready  to  buy.  In  God  we  trust,  all others pay cash .   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  W here to get the best burner phones ?  I f you need traceless burners, anywhere you don't usually shop that doesn't have cameras is probably a good idea. That means not in your hometown. Forget Amazon and eBay .  Burners are cheap with a few being only ten dollars or so, but if you're the truly paranoid type you can buy one from a different mom and pop store every time you need one, use it once for whatever security operation you need, then wipe the device and disperse the pieces in multiple locations .  Flea Markets are a good secondary source for burners. I've bought a few and they're 'just as good' as the Big Box store kind with the only caution being you need to ensure it isn't tracking you from the outset. You'll need new a SIM card as well. Failing that, there's also a few sources on the Deep Web, aka the Darknet, using Tor and Bitcoins to purchase one .  If  I  can't  store  it  at  my  house  or  my  office  then  where  am  I  supposed to keep it? A safety deposit box ?  No. In fact, never store it at a bank at all or any place secured with your ID. Store it at a friend's house instead. Oh but he doesn't want it there either because  if  he's  your  friend  he  probably  knows  all  about  your  top  secret operation and doesn't want the liability. Do you have a secure HQ set up? Somewhere private and away from cell towers where members meet? One possibility is storing it at an abandoned site, possibly in a rural setting .   W hat about batteries ?  Batteries  are  a  problem  but  not  if  you  don't  activate  the  phone prematurely. One solution is to keep them somewhere safe until the day you need it. Store in a PVC tube and hide in a tree with tree bark super-glued to it. If you live near a lake you'll see many places where one could be stored under  a  pier  in  a  waterproof  bag.  Of  course,  you  don't  want  to  store everyone's batteries or phones there .  Good opsec is hard work .   FARADAY CAGES  A faraday bag or 'cage' is a storage place where radio waves are forbidden and  by  extension  data,  since  data  uses  radio  waves  to  relay  messages.  A nice place to hide a phone, though I can't think of even one home appliance that  lends  itself  to  simple  modification  for  an  effective  Faraday  cage. Microwave  ovens  make  for  one  unreliable  cage,  believe  me.  Just  put  a burner inside and try calling it to see for yourself .  The  holes  are  the  problem.  They're  tiny  enough  to  prevent  the wavelengths  that  the  microwave  uses  from  passing  through.  Shorter wavelengths though  ones with more energy  will pass through. My twelve- year-old nephew once came over and asked what I was doing. I told him flat out then looked at him. This blank expression came along his face .  I hadn't seen him in a good long while so I showed him the same phone I saved from 1983, the same year Return of the Jedi came out. His eyes lit up .  ''Wow,'  he  says.  "I  bet  it's  got  all  kinds  of  illegal  parts,"  only  then  he grabs  it  and  starts  mashing  the  holes  like  they  were  smartphone  buttons. He'd never seen one that required 'dialing '.  Moving on . You'll  have  to  buy  a  radio  frequency  shielding  bag  that  blocks  every signal to and from the cell phone, or go to PrivacyCase.com and get one from  the  pros.  They're  asking  more  than  everyone  else,  but  their  product works quite well. They had it lab tested and the thing doesn't leak, period. No cellular, no wi-fi, no GPS, nothing .  Another  option  is  if  you  own  a  gun  cabinet  made  of  metal.  Line  the inside with a 1 4' wire mesh and tin foil. Secure the tinfoil with foil duct   tape.  Now  you  can  store  your  emergency  electronics burners  with  your weapons, though admittedly this is time-consuming. There's something else you outta know, too .  That cell you're carrying is constantly being tracked by this cell tower or that tower even when you turn the GPS function off. Whenever your phone breaks contact with these towers, it'll increase power to the transmitter to reestablish  a  connection.  Power  consumption  goes  UP  and  drains  the battery .  Then there's the digital footprint of your cell going off the grid and then popping up somewhere else. Maybe even data related to why it went down. Certainly where it went down .  Then Barney the bored TSA guy wants to know what the deal is. He's in the  airport  and  thinks  he's  Michael  Weston  before  he  got  'burned'  by  the CIA. He'll say, "Well lookie here, some taffer tryin' to get all stealthy. We'll teach 'em to mess with us!" Then you've got problems .  W hat about hiding phones in a fridge ?  Edward  Snowden  suggested  using  a  fridge  as  a  kind  of  faraday  cage. True, a few may block sound, but that has no bearing on a radio's frequency. In  some  models  the  seal-gap  can  even  act  as  a  rudimentary  antenna! Microwave  ovens  aren't  the  solution  either  since  the  door  seal  blocks  RF only at 2.4 ghz - which is not a cell band .  It's hard work and hard to maintain. If you slip up with any of the above, you best consider your opsec broken. Once broken it cannot be unbroken . It  cannot  be  repaired  since  you  don't  know  how  many  now  know  your identity.  All  numbers,  accents,  purchases,  addresses  and  trails  are  now linked to you and you cannot unlink them .  It's why CIA agents work so hard at keeping a low profile. They offer verifiable  false  data that deceives outsiders into thinking something exists when it really doesn't. Unfortunately many of them lose friends and family over it, so they end up in a 'bubble' that's very hard to break out of. It's like that Eagles song: "You can check in but you can never leave ."  Earlier  I  mentioned  that  your  greatest  weakness  is  yourself.  There's another side to that coin and it's this: the NSA's greatest weakness is itself. They  tend  to  rely  on  signal  intelligence  for  everything  at  the  expense  of everything else. They rely too much on technology with not enough eyes on   the ground. This is in your favor because they can only see what you give them, like using your burner to call your girlfriend after all mission burners have been activated .  It's an elaborate chess match of move, countermove, attack, but if you  prevent them from getting near your queen, they cannot say checkmate .  Let me repeat it. Good opsec is hard work !   20 GHOST APPS FOR SMARTPHONES  C  all  me  paranoid,  but  I've  never  trusted  Android  to  completely  remove everything an app may leave inside my phone. The uninstall process seems a  little  'off'  to  me,  as  though  something  rotten  has  been  left  to  fester underneath and the OS just doesn’t care if I know about it or not. Windows is a little better, but with Android there's always some cryptic legalese about painless network access and maybe what it intends to modify, only it's in a kind  of  gnarled  and  twisted  doublespeak  that  even  I  can't  untangle.  Or maybe I just suck at deciphering legalese. I suck at deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphics too, but then Tutankhamen isn’t spying on my internet habits .  Nevertheless, a research paper came out last year that shed a lot of light on  the  subject  of  just  what  goes  on  under  Android's  hood.  They  called  it Taming  the  Android  AppStore:  Lightweight  Characterization  of  Android Apps .  Here's what they did . They tested over 2000 of the Play Store's free apps in every category using a Samsung-Galaxy S3 phone with Android 4.1. They accomplished this  using  a  VPN  which  dumped  IP  addresses  and  other  data  using TCPdump  -  which  monitored  every  app  on  the  phone.  The  result  wasn't pretty .  They found that many Android apps connected  without permission  to at least one of five hundred unique websites without leaving a trail. That's right. No popups. No emails. No opt-out. It connected to all sorts of things that kill anonymity outright to say nothing about general privacy .   Ad  trackers.  Behavior  analytics.  Click  trackers.  Tracking  servers.  The whole anti-privacy enchilada with Google sitting fat and happy at the top of the heap with that crooked Joker's grin. So why did they not engage in a little transparency ?  My theory is that it isn't that they don't have this ability from a technical standpoint.  They  do  indeed.  It's  that  they  need  to  grant  the  application developer access to your private data on a consistent day-to-day basis .  Speaking of private data, I've found most privacy advocates to care less about staying 'hidden' from the NSA and more about hiding from corporate entities.  Bragging  about  that  hot  new  IP  over  an  open  mic  network  like Skype is, to put it mildly, crazy business .  When  you  get  to  the  point  in  your  career  when  you're  discussing business startups, the first line of defense should always, without exception, be privacy focused. That's because Microsoft, Apple, Google and the like care  zero  about  protecting  you.  You  are  considered  by  them  to  be  their product.  Their  bottom  line.  That  includes  every  bit  of  hearsay,  gossip,  or stock details that zip around on Skype which, if you sign on the dotted line in their Terms of Service agreement, is fair game .  In the end, it isn't patents, copyrights, and lawsuits that shield your ideas and ventures and marketable products. It's trade secrets - and that requires you to kick their corporate noses out of your tent. And your business .  So what follows is the absolute end-all-be-all of must have addon apps that'll  turn  your  gremlin-built  Android  phone  into  a  veritable  fortress  of doom, from which nothing gets in or out without your express permission. Sort of like DungeonKeeper for mobile phones, except you call the shots .   SIGNAL  F irst  up  is  Signal,  the  popular  messenger  and  private  calling  app  on  the Google Play Store designed by Whisper Systems. It's the combining of two very secure encryption apps called TextSecure and RedPhone, both built by the same. Both apps began on iPhone and now have been brought over to Android. Several bonuses right off the bat jumped out at me .  The code is open source, reviewable by experts. That's a big one . No ads to speak of . Anyone can use this to communicate instantly and privately .     ORWEB  O rweb is a web browser created with your privacy in mind. It's newbie- friendly  and,  when  coupled  with  Orbot,  can  shield  you  from  network analysis,  supercookies  and  all  without  running  Flash,  the  same  Flash  that can introduce exploits into your Android system .  It  does  this  by  routing  your  traffic  through  international  computers remotely rather than going directly into a VPN or other proxy service. It's slower this way, but ensures a level of security above that of the average user .  The problem is that it's now outdated. Obsolete. As of now it has been upgraded  to  Orfox  status.  As  for  the  old  version   i.e.  Orweb ,  the developers had this to say :  "Orweb  is  built  upon  the  bundled  WebView   Webkit   browser component inside of the Android operating system. This has proven to be problematic because we cannot control the version of that component, and cannot  upgrade  it  directly  when  bugs  are  found.  In  addition,  Google  has made it very difficult to effectively control the network proxy settings of all aspects of this component, making it difficult to guarantee that traffic will not leak on all devices and OS versions ."   ORFOX  Orfox: Tor Browser for Android  D esigned with source code from Tor Browser, a few enhancements have been  added  to  make  it  a  rock-solid  browser  for  Android.  With  NoScript, HTTPS Everywhere and Tor Browser Button added in, it's a rock-solid tool for anonymous browsing .   D ifferences to note :  1  .   Other  than  the  fact  Orweb  is  outdated,  Orfox  is  vastly  superior  to Orweb  as  Orweb  focuses  on  minimal  browser-fingerprinting  and  cookies with fewer writes to disk .  2  .   Orweb  takes  up  less  than  2MB.  Orfox  comes  in  at  27MB.  This  is mainly due to Orfox becoming a more robust browser with a longer feature set .   F rom the Developer :  "Orfox  is  built  from  the  same  source  code  as  Tor  Browser   which  is built  upon  Firefox ,  but  with  a  few  minor  modifications  to  the  privacy enhancing features to make them compatible with Firefox for Android and the Android operating system ."  Orfox REQUIRES Orbot app for Android to connect to the Tor network .  In  as  many  ways  as  possible,  we  adhere  to  the  design  goals  of  Tor Browser,  by  supporting  as  much  of  their  actual  code  as  possible,  and extending their work into the additional Android components of Firefox for Android .  The  Tor  software  protects  you  by  bouncing  your  communications around  a  distributed  network  of  relays  run  by  volunteers  all  around  the world:  it  prevents  somebody  watching  your  Internet  connection  from learning  what  sites  you  visit,  it  prevents  the  sites  you  visit  from  learning your physical location, and it lets you access sites which are blocked ."   TELEGRAM  Telegram  T elegram is a message app that focuses on security. It's fast, simple and ad- free. A few of the benefits they offer are :  -  Cloud  Storage  :  Telegram  syncs  across  all  your  devices  so  you  can always  access  your  data.  Your  message  history  is  also  stored  in  the Telegram cloud .   - Group Chat & Sharing : you can form large group chats of up to 1000  members if you need to .  - Secret Chats : These are messages that, according to Telegram, can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content: messages, photos, videos and files. Secret Chats also use end-to-end encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient .   S o how secure is it? That largely depends on your security needs. If you require  rock-solid  security  like  the  kind  political  dissidents  in  China  use, then no. There's lots of questions floating around on the lack of peer review as well. But if you only want to keep Google  or the spouse  out of your affairs, then yes .  Using an app that has end-to-end encryption is better than non end-to- end and that uses closed source  i.e. Whatsapp , with no way to peer review it.  Telegram  also  does  not  store  your  secret  chats,  and  the  data  stays encrypted until it arrives at the receiver's phone .   However,  it  uses  non-standard  crypto.  Though  there  are  those  in  the security community who become nervous whenever a developer does this, the bottom line is that you and you alone must determine if this app fills your anonymity needs, or whether you need some other app like CryptoCat .   CHAT SECURE  C  hatSecure  is  an  open-source  chat  client  that  supports  encryption  over XMPP.  Previously  known  as  'Gibberbot',  it's  progressed  to  be  a  fairly reliable chat app for privacy. The downside is that it cannot stay connected or in an 'always-on' state since Apple forbids it. The upside is that it's free and  works  on  every  platform:  Android,  iPhone,  Mac  with  Adium,  Linux with Jitsi, and Windows with Pidgin .    F eatures :  - Every message you send with ChatSecure is private so long as your  recipient uses an OTR-compatible IM client - Delivers audio, photos, files and text . - Messages sent aren't stored in your phone's memory . - If used with Orbot, it can bypass many firewalls and blacklists . - Supports multiple accounts   ENCRYPTED E-MAIL  K-9 and OpenKeychain: Encrypted E-mail  K  -9  Mail  is  built  upon  Android's  native  email  application,  but  is  open- source.  It's  main  advantage  for  you  is  simplifying  email  management.  If you've got multiple accounts and need encryption, K-9 is your baby since it uses OpenPGP via OpenKeychain for encrypting messages .  OpenKeychain  EASYPGP   integrates  with  K-9  and  strengthens anonymous  communications.  The  encryption  it  uses  ensures  that  any communication can only be read by those with the proper key. When your recipient opens your message, they can see it is digitally signed by you  or not .  In  fact  that's  the  whole  point  of  PGP,  also  known  as  Pretty  Good Privacy. For your eyes only. That's to ensure you're speaking with the right person .  Y ou can also search for other people's keys online. Just remember that PGP is useful for two things :  1 . Privacy and Security, and  2. Authenticity .   By privacy , I mean that you can prevent people from seeing things you don't want them to see. For example, you can encrypt an email to someone or encrypt a file with a list of passwords .  By authenticity , I mean that you can ensure a message was sent written by the person you think it was and that it wasn't modified by a third party. Of course, these two can be combined .  I like to remember the opening scene from Wargames, where two missile silo  operators  have  to  turn  their  key  simultaneously  before  inputting  the nuclear launch codes .  P oints to Note :  Don't worry about reverting to your old email should K-9 not be to your  liking. This is easily done by uninstalling or going to  Settings --> Applications --> Manage Apps --> and choosing your app before clicking on "clear defaults". This resets the default app for that function. It's sort of like installing a new browser. Chrome  over  Firefox,  for  instance.  If  you  uninstall  Chrome,  Firefox  will still be there for you .  The  other  thing  is  that  if  you  want  to  export  the  K-9  settings somewhere, you will need to reboot your phone, after which the com.fsck.k9 directory should be accessible at the topmost level of the Android system .   KEYSYNC: SYNCING TRUSTED IDENTITIES  K eySync allows you to sync identities between OpenPGP and ChatSecure as  well  as  GnuPG.  The  app  needs  to  do  this  for  purposes  of  establishing trust between different apps on your Android device. Trust certificates, say, for Pidgin and Adium, need to be converted to ChatSecure so that there's no conflicting identities. It's sort of like having the same name and identity that matches all your credit cards. You can use Discover and MasterCard at the same place because of the identity match. Same concept here .  S yncing to ChatSecure   Now then. Let's say you wanted to sync between ChatSecure on your phone and maybe an app on your PC or laptop. Here's what you'd have to do :  - Ensure your phone is connected via USB . - Powerup KeySync and let it detect your system . - If it fails to find it, it will store the otr_keystore.ofcaes to your phone's  SD card. From there, ChatSecure can locate it .  Within  ChatSecure  you  can  go  to  your  Account  screen  &  choose "Activate  KeySync."  Then  you  use  the  QRCode  that  you  can  see  in KeySync to complete this process. And that code acts as the key passphrase to your keystore, so don't lose it or email it to anyone. It all sounds very convoluted, but you'll see it isn't once you go through it .   LASTPASS PASSWORD MANAGER  LastPass Password Manager  I absolutely love what I can do with LastPass. What does it do? Well you can use LastPass to store logins, create complex passwords and keep track of any team members passwords you have to keep under lock and key. You only need to remember one password however: your LastPassword .  It fills in logins for you and syncs passwords & passphrases anywhere you  need  it.  That's  not  all.  Some  other  neat  things  you  can  do   though   admittedly a few break your anonymity! , are :    Save and autofill usernames passwords for all online accounts    Streamline  online  shopping  with  Form  Fill  profiles   danger  Will     Store  memberships,  credit  cards,  &  sensitive  data  in  Secure  Notes    Search for logins and notes from your vault  useful     Organize sites by folders  very useful     Enable multifactor authentication to lock down your LastPass account    Share logins with friends family  This is an absolute no-no unless you  want to kill your anonymity outright .      Audit  the  strength  of  your  passwords  with  the  LastPass  Security  Robinson !    Risky !   .  Challenge  I n light of the above you may think what's the point since several features use services that are known to be hostile to privacy. Well, you don't need to use LastPass then. Many don't for the simple reason it is web-based. Try a Keypass database instead for offline activity, or sync with Dropbox .  Actually come to think of it, that's risky too since if you're unencrypted laptop  or  PC  gets  stolen,  then  you  must  consider  all  passwords compromised .  But let's compare an offline password manager like Password Safe with an online manager like LastPass for a moment. Weight the risks, so to speak .  Believe it or not, offline password managers carry risk just like online managers. Some believe that the password 'safe' file acts as the mother of all risks since it's the bottom ace card in a house of cards. But that's true for your PC too since all it takes is one keylogger to compromise your system . Without any manager at all a keylogger can record every pass you use. With a manager app, you can conceivably lose ALL of your passwords in one fell stroke. For this reason I suggest you pick one or the other. They both harbor strengths and weaknesses with one strength being that you can use your passwords on anyone's computer. That's pretty convenient under almost any scenario .   Alas, there's always a hacker lurking around, and make no mistake that an  online  database  can  be  breached  by  him  and  him  alone.  In  that  case, everyone goes down. Tens of thousands of users just like you. In this there is the safety in numbers element unless the hacker in question decides to sell every bit of data to the highest bidder. The silver lining is that you'll know  about  such  a  breach  almost  immediately  from  your  online  provider  assuming the company doesn't want a class-action lawsuit .    LINPHONE: ENCRYPTED VIDEO AND VOICE  OVER IP  VOIP   L inphone  short for Linux phone  is a free voice over IP, or VoIP service, and  SIP  client,  currently  developed  by  Belledonne  Communications  in France. It's now available for AppleiOS and Android as well as PCs, with the biggest advantage being it isn't limited to voice and video. You can send texts, chat, make multiple calls and even call up your friends for an audio conference .  T hree major new capabilities  have  been  added:  a  text  messaging  feature  chat   with  delivery  status  notification,  multiple  calls  and  audio   conferencing.  In  addition,  Linphone  supports  audio  with  speex  ,  G711 ,ILBC, GSM, SILK, G722, OPUS, and video with the VP8 codec .  I  f  you  want  to  talk  to  your  partners  using  Tor  then  you'll  need  to  use Onioncat  at  both  ends  since  Linphone  uses  UDP.  Instructions  on  using Linphone for anonymous VoIP over Tor can be found here, at the Whonix site. Just remember that Tor adds considerable latency so it will not be like those crystal clear calls Jason Bourne gets in a firefight in some back alley in Pakistan .   OBSCURACAM: THE PRIVACY CAMERA  L ike Pinta and Gimp , ObscuraCam allows you to blur faces in any photo or video that could lead to your identification. Use pixelation or blackout or even a funny nose glasses combo to edit out your identity. The app itself is designed by the GuardianProject and Witness.org, a human rights training organization .  U nfortunately the ObscuraCam app itself does not encrypt files in transit. For  that  you'll  have  to  resort  to  some  other  encryption  app  like  PGP  or Veracrypt and then go through the usual encryption routine like so :  - Install the app -  Create  an  encrypted  container  after  choosing  a  container  size  for  - Send the file  along with the password your recipient needs via PGP .  encrypting  Simple .   What  I  find  lacking  in  many  online  guides  however,  is  the  lack  of  metadata discussion. So allow me a short tangent on this important topic .   METADATA  P ut simply, metadata is used by search engines, intelligence agencies and even grocery store chains to track you. Obscuracam removes this. Things like  GPS  coordinates,  time date  of  image,  phone  owner's  name nic,  and phone model aren't recorded. In my view this is light years better than being able to blur faces on Facebook -which you should not be on anyway if you want privacy. The Exif Data Firefox plugin also makes a great companion tool as it can delete metadata from jpegs. Now onto some questions .  W hat else does metadata cover ?  In theory the amount of metadata available on a person is near infinite. But  they  don't  have  quantum  computers  yet  which  means  the  amount  of data on any one person is limited. We aim to limit it even more since even a single file can reveal a lot about you as a person .  W hat kind of files contain metadata ?  Any kind. Word docs, jpegs, bitmaps, mp3s. Everything and anything that carries a digital signature or hash can tell them where you live, what you  listen  to,  who  dumped  you  and  whether  you  squirt  your  ketchup  on your fries or on the side at the In n' Out burger .  I 'm a novelist. I don't care about any of that .   Sorry  to  tell  you  this  but  novelists  have  a  lot  to  worry  about  too, especially if they're self-publishers. Actually traditional pubbers too, since French  writer  Grégory  Delacourt  was  sued  by  Scarlett  Johansson  for 'stealing' her image. But that's another tale .  Novelists, writers and copywriters have to worry about privacy just like Stephen King. The master of horror storytelling once revealed his biggest blunder. He was asked if there was anything in his career that he regretted doing  or  saying,  other  than  writing  Maximum  Overdrive.  He  said,  "That damn American Express commercial from the eighties. Once I'd done that, people all over the world knew my face ."   ORBOT: PROXY WITH TOR  O rbot encrypts your internet traffic with Tor so that it cannot be traced. It does this by relaying traffic through relays around the world. No other tool does this like Tor, and makes it a useful privacy tool. Even the New York Times praised it .  "When a communication arrives from Tor, you can never know where  or whom it’s from ."  O kay, fair enough. But you must decide which is the bigger risk: Your cell provider or Google. I'd say both carry equal risk but, when you hand them   your identity on a silver platter, well, they don't even need a judge to take you down. Only a thinly-veiled reproach. Of course some countries carry more risk than others when you take your threat model into account. Next question .  I s there a way to hide the fact I'm using Tor  Orbot  from my ISP ?  Hiding Tor usage from your ISP provider isn't that hard. They'll know you're using Tor soon enough, just not what you're doing with it. They can also  monitor  you  till  the  cows  come  home  but  have  no  idea  what  hidden services you're accessing nor do they have a clue which content you send or receive  from  while  using  Tor.  It  can  be  detected,  however,  from  the  Tor relay node via the IP addresses you connect to .  To hide Tor usage itself from them you'll need to use a Tor bridge, or pluggable transport bridges  to prevent them from seeing you are on the Tor network .   OSMAND: OFFLINE MAPS AND NAVIGATION  O smand  OSM Automated Navigation Directions  is a navigation app used in conjunction with OpenStreetMap  OSM . It makes a stellar replacement for  Google  Maps,  but  it  isn't  anonymous  unless  you're  offline  the  whole time. It uses maps from OpenStreetMap and can be downloaded using Tor .   F eatures :  arrival    W orks online  fast  or offline  no roaming charges when you are abroad      Turn-by-turn voice guidance  recorded and synthesized voices      Optional  lane  guidance,  street  name  display,  and  estimated  time  of    Supports intermediate points on your itinerary   Automatic re-routing whenever you deviate from the route    Search  for  places  by  address,  by  type   e.g.:  restaurant,  hotel,  gas  station, museum , or by geographical coordinates .   One downside is that while the screenshots on the Play Store make it look  simple,  it's  not.  In  fact  it's  fairly  complex  and  the  controls  are somewhat unintuitive .   OSTEL: ENCRYPTED PHONE CALLS  O stel is a  product  designed  for  keeping  your  calls  private.  So  private  in fact, that it offers end-to-end encryption at both ends. And if you believe the United States to be the only one data mining everything on the internet, I've got a friendly rattlesnake to sell you .  I've got some mixed feelings about Ostel and I'm sure you will to. To begin with you must register for an account at Ostel.co . That was the first red flag. From the dial pad I had to key in 9196 then click the green icon in the  corner  before  I  could  speak.  Then  came  the  echo  test  which  I  found similar to Skype's test. All in all, its a hit and miss scenario, but I concede your luck may be better than mine. The pros are as follows :  - Supports: Android, iPhone, Mac, Win, Linux & Blackberry Nokia - Integrates well with CSipSimple app for Android - Supports end-to-end encrypted using ZRTP & SRTP . - Makes for a great privacy tool  C ons :  Encrypted  phones  sound  intriguing  to  just  about  every  anonymity enthusiast out there, especially beginners. The problem? Configuring some of these apps can be like toying with a rattlesnake itself. Technical hurdle is putting it mildly indeed. Besides that, encrypted voice apps are really a hit and miss and here are a few reasons why .  Apps such as this one, based on my use of it, reveal a lot of counter- intuitive design decisions that don't mesh well with the Android interface,   nor with what Android users are accustomed to. This isn't a problem for a technically minded person but beginners will have a hard time navigating around since a lot of these don't follow Android design specs .  Case in point: No activity light. Remember when almost every PC came with one so that you could see the hard drive being accessed? That's absent far  too  often  these  days.  There's  a  few  other  red  flags,  one  being  the guessing game as to when the encryption actually began and when it ended .  C onfusion . Ostel was as different to Linphone as the sun is to the moon in the directions. I'm quite good guessing games but even I tended to wander around  like  I  was  in  a  fog,  patting  my  hands  like  a  blind  person.  I  can imagine  how  confusing  it  would  be  for  someone  new  to  encrypted  voice calls. In one instance I ended up making a call through my normal phone line with the dial pad. There was no indication this was taking place until I ran some tests to confirm it. Strike one .  S etting up an account at Ostel.co was uninspiring, with the SIP provider not being clear on just what their definition of anonymity is, which bothered me. Throughout the process I kept thinking that newcomers will abandon ship when they realize they cannot call Skype anonymously  you need to call someone with a SIP client to ensure the call is private . That should be loud and clear on the front page .  C annot call landlines from Ostel and have it encrypted. This was a deal killer for me, but I'll waive the strike since you may not need to call them at all .  M etadata . The app is bad at hiding it from others. Contacts, call history and such, seemed to be not terribly high on the app's priorities, unlike the Tor Browser Bundle. I admit that to compare Tor with encrypted phone use   is perhaps premature as it is in it's infancy, but metadata is the hook, line and sinker of the NSA and thus must be executed as a priority one mission objective .  T hey log data . They claim to log enough data to run the service, but it sounds like the same ploy I hear from VPN providers looking to cover their backsides. We know VPN companies are great at offering privacy but for anonymity, many come up lacking. Strike two .  N o Tor support . Also a deal killer, but this may be due to the prematurity of the service and not related to the company itself. Voice over IP doesn't work  well  with  Tor  anyway  due  to  the  way  Tor  works   torrents  as  well , which means Orbot won't work well with it. Strike three .   TEXTSECURE  T extSecure  now Signal  is an open-source communication app that allows you  to  avoid  SMS  fees  and  share  media  with  colleagues,  friends  and  the like, privately. We list it here if you're a little uneasy about using Signal .  S o how secure is it ?  Very  secure,  though  obviously  not  as  secure  as  the  newly  revamped Signal  app.  An  interesting   though  insanely  technical   research  paper  is available online and is called 'How Secure is TextSecure' . It's put out by the   Horst  Institute  for  IT  Security  and  their  conclusion  was  that  three  apps outside  of  Tor  outshine  all  others  for  anonymity:  Threema,  Surespot  and TextSecure. You can draw your own conclusions, but I've tested every app and  found  TextSecure  to  be  a  great  tool  to  use  for  any  operation  that requires staying off the grid .   PIXELKNOT: HIDDEN MESSAGES  P ixelknot allows you to send a short message within a photo that only the recipient can read. The practice involves what is known as 'steganography', or the act of embedding a hidden message in any format. In that vein it's somewhat  similar  to  PGP,  but  uses  the  F5  algorithm  to  obscure  your message. The developers  i.e. The Guardian Project  issued this standard to strive toward :  - H ave the original image appear, to the trained human eye, unedited .  - Have the bytes of the image appear, to a trained analyst, undistorted so  much so as to arouse suspicion .  -  Have  the  complete  message  be  recoverable  no  matter  how  it  is  transmitted .   I  've  used  it  for  other  types  of  communication  but  let's  look  at  one  in particular: Usenet. My favorite stomping ground since 1983 .  Let's assume for a moment you want to send an anonymous message to someone on Usenet, perhaps in one of the many Mp3 newsgroups, and let's also assume you don't want Google indexing that message for all eternity.  Well actually, they will anyway  .  You'd first pull up the app, choose a picture to hide the message in, and send  it  using  a  Usenet  posting  app  knowing  that  even  though  the  picture itself is quite visible to others, what is encoded therein is not. In fact, they could not even tell that it is a picture manipulated by Pixelknot. It's true that Google  will  index  this  for  eons,  but  until  quantum  computing  becomes widespread, won't be able to decrypt it .  If on the other hand you post an encrypted message using PGP, well, it's obvious  you  don't  want  others  to  see  it  if  you  post  it  in  designated encryption  newsgroups.  The  same  is  true  for  the  popular  encryption containers like those of Truecrypt or Veracrypt. Any extension  unless you change it  often gives away the app used and by extension the intent of the sender .   YOUR SECURITY NEEDS ARE NOT MY OWN  A  dmittedly,  some  of  these  apps  don’t  quite  cut  the  mustard  anymore. Perhaps you tried a few and for whatever reason they just didn’t float your boat. The apps mentioned herein aren't the only ones of course. They're just the  ones  that  provided  for  my security  needs.  Yours  may  be  different.  Of course, I was a little worried about the authorities mandating a 'back door' in  a  few  but  then  I  realized  that  using  plain  old  run-of-the-mill  SMS  is almost  always  intercepted  by  local  sheriffs  and  municipal  police  to  begin with. Everywhere .  Between  using  SMS  and  an  open-source  app  by  one  of  the  most respected security researchers in the world, you probably know which one to use. My skills aren't really up to tracking the changelog on GitHub and recompiling it myself for Verizon's SMS, so I'll just trust WhisperSystems instead .  As a side note, as soon as Microsoft paid 8.5 billion for Skype, it found itself in a much deeper U.S. jurisdiction than Windows settled for. Skype makes voice calls to the PSTN  i.e. the public switched telephone network  and  when  that  happened,  it  fell  under  the  CALEA  Act.  That's  the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, an act initiated by the US Congress to facilitate wiretapping of U.S. domestic telephone and Internet traffic .  Skype encryption is not end to end . And  now  that  Microsoft  lives  smack  dab  in  the  middle  of  every conversation uttered over Skype in the USA  and even abroad , they have a nice intercept point to eavesdrop from their servers. By contrast, TextSecure  now  Signal   does  not  own  a  voice  service.  So  there's  no  intercept   requirements.  If  TextSecure  were  ever  to  resort  back  to  SMS,  then  law enforcement can sniff the ciphertext. But without the key, its pretty useless .   GHOST APPS FOR THE BLACK MARKET  F irst up is GRAMS, the Darknet Search Engine  G rams's engine was designed to be used primarily for exploring the Deep Web. Announced on Reddit over a year ago, it has made some great strides in indexing things you cannot find on the regular web. But like Google in 1996, they're in a very early stage of indexing things, so it's not perfect and offers nowhere near the complexity that Google does .  It  does  share  some  of  the  traits  of  Google's  algorithm  though,  like having  a  scoring  system  based  on  how  long  the  listing  has  been  up,  how many transactions, and how many good reviews any one site has. That way you'll see the best listing first - similar to what you'd see using Google .  T he Grams Infodesk can be reached at the Onion site here :   h ttp:  grams7enufi7jmdl.onion  infodesk  Y ou will need Tor to access this onion site .  Duck Duck Go   DUCKDUCKGO  D uckDuckGo strives to become the next great internet search engine that protects user's privacy and avoids the filter bubble of personalized search results that Google is so famous for .  The  results  are  a  compilation  of  about  50  sources  including  Yahoo! Search,  BOSS,  Wikipedia,  Bing  and  the DuckDuckBot, among others. The best part is that while the regular search site is at DuckDuckGo.com, you can use the Duck onion site to perform a clearnet  search,  which  adds  yet  another  layer  of  security  to  your  regular web usage. The link is at :  its  own  Web  crawler,   h ttp:   3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion    N ote: Obviously you will need to be connected to the Tor network for the above onion link to work .  P ros to Using DuckDuckGo  In March, 2015, DuckDuckGo retrieved more than 9 million searches for the first time since she set sail. That month also saw the search engine retrieve more than 250 million searches.   Where there are great numbers, there is camouflage. Plus, their competition could set new common rules for privacy among web service providers, which would include Google . You can always precede a search query with g! to see what Google's results would be. For instance :  "Mustangs !g" -> search for Mustangs on Google . "Mustangs !gi" -> search for Mustangs on Google image "Mustangs !yt" -> Youtube "Mustangs !b" -> Bing More here: https:  duckduckgo.com bang  When DuckDuckGo lists results that it got from Yahoo or Bing, your phone or laptop isn't getting cookies from Yahoo or Bing .  Cons to Using DuckDuckGo  DuckDuckGo labels itself as a privacy search engine, so it won't be terribly helpful to use it for things requiring location. A search for "air conditioners for sale in New Orleans, LA" will give you a craigslist-like site, followed by a contractor's webpage, and a link to YellowPages. The same search on google gives the names of some local and major-chain businesses who sell and install air conditioners .  And  in  case  you're  wondering  if  'incognito'  mode  stops  Google's tracking that results from your Google searches, the answer is no. A loud no with arms waving no. Only a non-tracking search engine like DuckDuckGo  that  can  guarantee  your  privacy   does  that.  Bing  and  Yahoo  and  Google will still record everything you do regardless of any incognito mode, as it affects the browser options and not the search engine of choice .  Another thing about our beloved Google, whose name keeps popping up like some handle-bar mustached villain in a bad play. Google knows your preferred home temperature and your work schedule when you're away at Six Flags and when  you  go  to  sleep  and  wake  up,  all  thanks  to  the  Nest Learning  Thermostat.  That,  coupled  with  Google  Pictures   which  logs   images on your phone or PC  makes for one very bright laser red dot on your back. People love convenience over security, even before Ben Franklin wrote his famous quote on liberty and security .  Google Wallet? Again, convenience. They keep all data related to every purchase  you  make,  every  sale,  and  coordinate  it  all  with  every  email message  you  write.  Remember  what  Google  founder  Eric  Schmidt  said some years ago ?  "Google will soon know more about you than you know yourself !". They now have far more data on you than the NSA does and that data is only a warrant away. Rest assured they will not offer 1 10th the privacy that DuckDuckGo does .   NOTECIPHER  N oteCipher is a simple notepad app. All notes created and stored by this app are saved fully secured using 256-bit AES encryption. They are never stored in an unencrypted state on the disk, only in memory. It was ported to Android in 2011 by the Guardian Project .     APG  O penPGP is another good privacy app for Android. It's open source and its goal is to provide a similar OpenPGP implementation as GnuPG .    If you're browsing Darknet Markets you may run across the occasional vendor whose key wont work with APG. But this is rare. In any case you can use GnuPrivacyGuard to help .  As a side note, if you're worried about the app broadcasting that you're using Apg v.1.1. whatever  yet don't want anyone knowing you use APG , you  could  always  edit  the  version  before  sending  out  any  message. Example: Put Version: GnuPG v2 and anyone else would assume that's the encryption program you are using .   BITCOIN WALLET  W ant to have your Bitcoins always with you? Check out Bitcoin Wallet .  You pay by quickly scanning a QR-code and if you're a merchant, you'll receive  payments  reliably  and  instantly.  Bitcoin  Wallet  is  the  first  mobile Bitcoin app and arguably one of the most secure .     No  registration,  web  service  or  cloud  needed.  This  wallet  is  de-    Display of Bitcoin amount in BTC, mBTC and µBTC .   Conversion to and from national currencies .   Sending and receiving of Bitcoin via NFC, QR-codes or Bitcoin URLs  centralized .  .    Address book for regularly used Bitcoin addresses .   When you're offline, you can still pay via Bluetooth .   System notification for received coins .   Sweeping of paper wallets  e.g. those used for cold storage  .   App widget for Bitcoin balance .     CHATSECURE  C  hatSecure  is  a  free  and  open  source  messaging  app  that  features  OTR encryption  over  XMPP.  You  can  connect  to  your  existing  accounts  on Facebook  or  Google,  create  new  accounts  on  public  XMPP  servers  including via Tor , or even connect to your own server for extra security .  Unlike  other  apps  that  keep  you  stuck  in  their  walled  garden, ChatSecure is fully interoperable with other clients that support OTR and XMPP, such as Adium, Jitsi, and more .  Strong Cryptography  C hatSecure  only  uses  well-known open  source  cryptographic  libraries  to keep  your  conversations  private.  Other  apps  may  make  claims  about "military  grade"  security  but,  without  publicly  auditable  source  code  and verifiable end-to-end encryption, you cannot be 100% safe .  Some of what it offers : - XMPP with TLS certificate pinning . - OTR for verifiable end-to-end encryption and forward secrecy . - Tor to help bypass restrictive firewalls . - SQLCipher to locally encrypt conversation logs .  Anonymouth   R ecall earlier what we said about looking like everyone else when  using Tor. Enter Anonymouth .  Stylometrics is the study of a person's writing 'style'. It analyzes your writing and creates a trackable profile out of it. In other words, your 'voice' in your writing or the way you phrase simple statements, word length, word choice, misspelled words and so on. Where cell phone opsec is concerned it can be impossible to predict who has this ability and where and when and what you can do to blend in without looking like you're trying to blend in . It can be a double-edged sword but, there are a few pearls I can dispense with here .  Long  messages  are  just  bad  OPSEC  any  way  you  slice  it.  To  counter this, Edward Snowden used short and punchy messages to throw off anyone trying to trace his NSA leaks back to him. This was good since if one used Tor and nothing else without care of what was previously published, it'd be pretty easy for the NSA to link him to previous documents he'd written on the open net .  As  for  us,  we  have  the  option  of  using  Anonymouth.  It's  a  tool  for anonymizing every word we spit out on the open web. It's not simple to use but like PGP it can be a life saver if you need protection for any sensitive data. How does it work ?  It  uses  Java  to  analyze  previous  works  with  present-day  works, compares them and then tips you off to overused words, then suggests fixes to help you 'blend in'. You can even tell it to scan a folder or group of docs you'd like to 'anonymize '.  For instance. Let's say you are an Iranian political dissident using Tor. You also happen to be a journalist. Although your anonymous by way of IP address,  the  government  in  Tehran  could   in  theory   still  analyze  your anonymous posts and compare them to your known writings, say on your public  blog.  Same  with  leaking  emails  from  a  corrupt  business.  Maybe they'll compare what you mailed to a newspaper to all emails on a corporate server .  There's  plenty  of  scenarios  where  this  could  be  useful.  It  can  be  downloaded from the Github website at :  g ithub.com psal  anonymouth   GHOSTERY  G hostery is very  popular  at  the  moment.  What  does  it  do?  It  reports  all tracking packages detected  and whether Ghostery has blocked them or not  in a "findings window" accessible from clicking on the Ghostery Icon in the browser.  When  configured,  Ghostery  also  displays  the  list  of  trackers present on the page in a temporary purple overlay box .  With the "Ghost rank" reporting feature enabled, Ghostery transmits the full HTML code of the page visited to Ghostery, Inc., and takes note key data  such  as  the  advertising  distribution  systems  that  users  encounter  and the speed at which these load on the page .  I recommend this app if you need to hide from Google. As for the NSA or Iranian government? Not a chance. According to a few online sources, they  sell  your  data.  To  whom  or  what  is  anyone's  guess.  And  there  are claims of this app being spyware .  But,  you  can  prevent  Ghostery  from  doing  this  by  opting  out  of  the Ghost  Rank  feature.  The  feature  is  opt-in  so  if  you  didn't  already  opt  in there  is  nothing  you  need  to  do.  If  this  feature  bothers  you,  there's  a  few others I can recommend. One of which is PrivacyBadger. More on that one in a bit .   FLASHCONTROL  F lashControl gives you control over which sites are allowed to display the Flash  player  or  the  HTML5  player.  With  FlashControl  installed,  web content  that  requires  Flash  plugins  will  be  disabled  by  default.  You  then enable content by clicking on a blocked area on any given webpage, or via Flashcontrol's  address  bar  icon.  You  can  also  reblock  content  that  you've unblocked .  This  can  help  reduce  CPU  load  and  provide  some  security  control  so that content isn't automatically loaded without your permission. You can get it at the Mozilla Addons site .  Sidenote:  I  tend  to  walk  among  the  block-all-flash  and  then  click-to- play guys, but I just wish some of the video-streaming providers that use Flash would dump it and use HTML5. Then I could lead a very Flash-free life .   PRIVOXY  P  rivoxy  is  a  non-caching  web  proxy  with  filtering  capabilities  for enhancing privacy, manipulating cookies and modifying web page data and HTTP headers before the page is rendered by the browser .  It's a privacy enhancing proxy. That is, it filters Web pages and removes advertisements.  Privoxy  can  be  customized  by  users  for  both  stand-alone systems and multi-user networks and can be chained to other proxies .  It's  frequently  used  in  combination  with  Squid  and  can  be  used  to bypass Internet censorship. Get it at the Privoxy homepage at privoxy.org .   TACO  T aco stands for Targeted Advertising Cookie Opt-Out .  This app auto-blocks hundreds of web beacons, bugs, and other tracking technologies  that  advertisers  and  others  use  to  track  you.  Sounds  like Ghostery to me. What it amounts to setting permanent opt-out cookies for Google and 25 others, even if those cookies are deleted by Firefox .  Now a word from our sponsor . You  need  to  understand  something  about  so-called  "opt-out"  cookies and their respective apps, which I think can be a little misleading. A couple of thoughts .  First,  if  you  read  the  fine  print  of  virtually  every  company's  privacy policy  regarding  cookie  use,  you'll  find  that  they  promise  not  to  display targeted ads to you based on your personal web history. That is, you'll see ads that a person would see if they were not being tracked. However, many still  track  you.  When  you  start  digging  around  in  their  lawyer-speak agreements you'll often find that they rarely promise that they won't track you 100%, just that they won't show you personalized ads based on their data. They still use these opt-out cookies to do any of the following :  Track your movements, as in what sites you visit . What you click on . What you buy with credit cards or even Paypal .   S  econdly,  they  then  use  this  data  for  their  own  marketing  purposes  and may decide to sell it to other companies. So in terms of privacy, this addon by  itself  is  inadequate  without  the  aid  of  a  lot  of  the  other  addons  we mention  -  primarily  because  it  gives  people  the  false  idea  that  somehow their privacy is being protected by opt-out cookies when it's not .   ADBLOCK PLUS  A  dblock  Plus  for  Firefox  is  the  most  downloaded  browser  extension worldwide and winner of the About.com Reader's Choice Award, as well as the Linux New Media award for the Best Open Source Firefox Extension. Whenever I've had to re-install an OS, this is the first addon I install after Firefox .  Depending  on  the  filter  lists  you  have  activated,  you  can  even  block YouTube  video  ads  and  Facebook  tracking.  Filter  lists  are  created  by members of the open source community and free to use. If you don't want to rely on filter lists you can create your own blocking rules to customize your web  experience.  It  all  sounds  like  a  lucid  dream  for  the  budding  privacy advocate .  However . AdBlock  introduced  the  Acceptable  Ads  Program  a  few  years  back. That means various companies can pay AdBlock so that their ads are added to a long 'whitelist', so that you see them in your browser. They've actually been doing this for a good while now though not many users know about it .   NOSCRIPT  N oScript allows JavaScript, Java and other executable content to run only from trusted domains of your choice. Things like your home-banking web site,  guarding  your  "trust  boundaries"  against  cross-site  scripting  attacks  XSS ,  cross-zone  DNS  rebinding     CSRF  attacks   router  hacking ,  and Clickjacking attempts, thanks to its ClearClick technology .  That's  not  a  simple  description,  obviously,  and  for  good  reason  since NoScript isn't a simple addon. It's very complex, but like chess is easy to learn, hard to master .  My biggest reason for using it is that NoScript users are less vulnerable to exploits than non-users. And it does a lot more than just whitelist what sites can run scripts. It also offers protection against clickjacking and cross- site  scripting  even  if  you  whitelist  sites.  A  few  users  even  run  it  while globally-allowing scripts by default simply to get a few other benefits. So it's more than just a privacy tool. It's an anonymity tool. It comes bundled with the Tor Browser for good reason .  Another aspect I like is that the permissions function is very domain- specific.  You  can  allow  google.com  to  run  scripts,  for  instance,  but  deny google-analytics.com  or  gstatic.com.  Or  you  can  allow  maps.google.com but deny all other .google.com sites. And you can even  temporarily  allow sites you'd normally deny if you need them for a specific task .  S o what's the  worst  that  could  happen  if  you  retain  No  Script  while allowing scripts globally ?   You're more vulnerable to exploits that aren't being guarded against, for one. Even if you visit a website you don't trust, scripts will still run. There'll just  be  some  protection  against  dodgy  techniques  that  you  wouldn't otherwise have. And some scripts have an easier time "phoning home" and fingerprinting you. Then there's the badly-coded sites that eat up your RAM and CPU cycles .  Though there's a slight learning curve to NoScript, it isn't hard to figure out. You can block most web bugs from Facebook, Google and Twitter and the like. The 'like' button on Facebook is one such web bug. Every time you visit a site that has that button  you need not press it , a lot of data goes back  to  Facebook  about  your  online  habits.  Same  with  Twitter's  'Tweet' buttons and Google's G+ buttons .  In the beginning, my biggest nitpicks were :  Dealing with sites that want to run a gazillion scripts from a huge number of different domains, and How hard it was to judge the trustworthiness of third-party domains .  Obviously  you  must  judge  each  site  yourself  according  to  your  own opsec needs, but I solved the above two issues this way for general open net browsing :  Whenever you hit a new website, enable enough of them to get basic site  functionality.  Usually  this  means  you'll  allow  the  ones  with  the  site name  in  them  and  work  outward  from  there  to  some  of  the  legitimate- sounding  ones.  Enabling  past  this  point  defeats  NoScript's  purpose,  but you'll  eventually  get  a  feel  for  what  you  need  to  enable  to  get  the  site working .   UMATRIX  u  Matrix  is  a  point-and-click  matrix-based  firewall.  Just  point  &  click  to forbid or allow any class of requests made by your browser. Not only does it block javascript, but also cookies, css, plugins, images and more on either a per domain or global basis. The interface is pretty easy, too. It exists as a plugin for both Firefox and Chrome .  Personally I like to keep NoScript for the XSS protection. uMatrix will still block javascript very well but once you allow some javascript, it will step  aside.  NoScript  will  still  scan  allowed  javascript  for  obvious  XSS attempts and prevent it .  uBlock Origin  u Block Origin is a content filter by the developer of uMatrix. It shares a bit of the same functionality of uMatrix but is better suited to blocking ads. It can  use  the  same  filter  lists  as  Adblock  Plus.  There's  two  versions:  the original by Raymond Hill which has been renamed from uBlock to uBlock Origin, and a fork by Chris Aljoudi which retains the original name, uBlock .  You can use all of the above since NoScript and uMatrix often strive for the same goal. They're just fundamentally different. NoScript only blocks scripts but uMatrix blocks whole connections .  From  a  privacy  perspective,  uMatrix  is  the  way  to  go  because  the  connection never gets established .   From a security perspective,  NoScript  is  superior.  You  must  decide  if you  want  to  run  each  script.  With  uMatrix  you  can  only  decide  on  a  per connection  basis  and  NoScript  won't  stop  third  parties  from  connecting. Either  one  presents  their  own  unique  hassles.  But  even  so,  I  recommend installing Privacy Badger and uBlock .  For more tools on anonymity  and a lot of other useful information  see  the following link at the addon switchboard :  h ttps:  github.com gorhill httpswitchboard  wiki   CELL KEYLOGGERS  K  eyloggers  are  a  mixed  breed  of  dog,  and  like  any  mixed  breed  I  have some mixed feelings about them. They can save your hide by defending you to the death, or they can get someone's reputation or way of life destroyed. So what's a keylogger ?  It's an app that secretly records keystrokes and sends them by way of sleuthy internet magic to some evildoer on the other side of the world. Or your dad could use it to catch your mom spying on him .  They really have a million uses and, right or wrong, it is parents that are the  only  ones  truly  equipped  to  play  Big  Brother,  and  do  so  ethically  . Certainly  they've  got  the  know-how  to  reign  in  a  reckless  teen  who's  too street-smart for his own good. Dad know the limits because Dad knows the kid inside and out. Not government. Not the FBI. And most certainly not the police .  We've  seen  what  happens  to  sexting  teenagers  who  pass  around  nude  photos like baseball cards. It ain't pretty .  Courts and cops trawl em, raid em and jail em and then claim to 'help' the  kids  by  throwing  them  on  the  sex  offender's  list  because,  well,  that's what they like to do to other people's kids . I don't know about you but I think the parents can do a much better job than any bureaucrat. So below are a few I recommend if you've got a 14 year old experimenting with car jackings or gang related activity. You know, serious crimes .  For  other  things  like  weed,  curfew  breaking  and  voyeurism,  I'd  not recommend  any  of  these,  especially  for  older  teens.  Reason  being  is because they may find out their being spied on. Call it a sixth sense. Then   they'll  Google  all  kinds  of  ridiculous  things  just  to  toy  with  you.  Search terms like :  Sex change operations . How to make a PB&J with the crusts cut off . How long would a rubber duck float in the Gulf of Oman . My cat wants me to get an abortion . Is narcissism genetic ? How do cows scratch their knees if they itch ?  Stuff like that. And if you've got a kid whose intelligence rivals that of Neo in The Matrix, then you've met your match. He could get a USB stick, put a live install of Linux on it and boot from the USB drive. Keep the USB drive hidden when he isn't using it .  It's  a  reverse  whammy  unless  you  somehow  take  his  stick,  guess  his password, figure out Ubuntu and find a way to install a Linux keylogger. Even if that happened, he can just format it and put a fresh copy of Ubuntu on it again .  Anyway for the uninitiated, here's the first one. It's called Spy Bubble .  It monitors cell phone use on any mobile device you can think of .  After you install it, monitoring begins instantly. It'll monitor and record information  on  the  target  phone  in  complete  stealth,  giving  you  complete access to any sensitive information you could be looking for. At $50 bucks, it ain't free. But it's a helluva lot cheaper than hiring a lawyer .  The  downside  is  that  SpyBubble  can't  track  stored  videos  or  calendar events. It can't block phone numbers, websites or mobile apps. It can't set keyword alerts to send notice if the phone is used to access inappropriate material. You also can't use it to see BlackBerry Messenger chats either .  Second up is Spyera .   T hird is MobileSpy .  F ourth is Flexispy   F ifth and last is MobiStealth .  A ll of these keyloggers basically do the same thing: spy on your kids, or the competing used car lot owner across the street .  Detecting Keyloggers  Detecting keyloggers isn't exactly brain surgery. You just need to know where  to  look.  Sometimes  it's  difficult,  but  there's  usually  others  online who've gone through the trouble of posting a thread on a forum somewhere. So help abounds. Here's a few ways you can check for keylogger modules that may have wormed their way  with a little help from the Mrs.  into your system .  Most keyloggers use a kind of DLL-injection to get under the hood and stay  there  without  you  seeing  it.  That  means  that  a  DLL  will  show  up   mapped to a process's address space, as seen below :  The  pyd   python  extension   file  sits  at  the  top  in  the  second  section under 'Name'. This one's been loaded right into Windows Explorer's address space, which means it'll run every time Explorer is run. For anything you need Explorer to do. That makes it hard to get rid of without dedicated anti- virus software that knows what to look for .  DLLs like this want to see *everything* you type, so they typically load themselves  into  every  target  address  space  available.  For  a  smart  cookie who knows his PC like the back of his hand, he'll likely see odd DLLs here and  there  that  look  suspicious  -  files  he  can't  link  to  any  products  he's bought or uses. He can bring these up in a list for every process. Geeks do this enough every day to where they begin to see anomalies, or 'ghost files' that shouldn't be there. They don't like to rely on anti-virus programs alone . That's one thing that kids are lousy at: noticing things like a tiny switch  or GPS device  hooked under the car ignition. Spyware companies depend on kids being uninformed .  Solutions ? 1.  You can study the 'drivers' folder for any strange files . 2.  Create a debug boot file with BcdEdit and hook up a firewire cable and hit a break point when the module loads and study ALL modules, every one, filtering details as you go along. Any DLL driver can't do squat about you  looking  at  it  before  it's  loaded  into  Windows.  This  is,  of  course,  the complicated way of doing things .  3.  Almost all keyloggers phone home somewhere else. So connect to a transparent  proxy  and  note  connections  not  familiar  to  you.  You  may  see something along the lines of 'myspy.ukraine.com' rather than just your usual VPN address .  4.   Purchase  an  'anti-keylogger'  program.  There  as  numerous  as  anti-  virus vendors, but not all equal .  Obviously if you're using this spyware to monitor your kids, they won't have half the brainpower to do any of the above unless they've got a few whiz  kids  in  their  circle  of  friends.  Better  safe  than  sorry,  I'm  with  the parents on this one .   TOR AND CELL PHONES  T or users generally fall into one of two categories: The average Joe who can't be bothered to expand his knowledge of security past an intermediate level  is  one  of  them.  He's  super  confident,  and  generally  he  likes  things easy-peasy.  Press  a  button  and  go.  Many  Mac  users  used  to  fall  into  this category  but  now  many  Windows  users  get  overconfident  in  their  own security abilities .  The  other  group  are  Tor  superhackers  who  can  smell  a  Tor  honeypot from  Hong  Kong  to  Longview,  Texas.  They  know  when  the  cops  are around. Hounds, they are. They can smell the red-blue, red-blue of a police cruiser's lights long before they come on .  While their numbers are few, they're also the restless types since they can't  sleep  unless  they've  plugged  every  security  hole  imaginable  and chained enough proxies to circle the moon. Even then they're generally the most paranoid obsessed micro-managers this side of a psych ward. We aim to be somewhere in the middle .  But  you  should  know  that  even  with  the  anonymous  Tor  browser, anonymity on a cell phone is harder than on a PC because of how phones are  now  entwined  with  social  media  applications  and  your  real  identity. This, along with how Google loves to track every move you make  even if you whistle a copyrighted tune out your backside , makes smartphone opsec very problematic indeed for the survivalist and anonymity enthusiast .  But first, a refresher on the basics .  Tor & IP Addresses   I'll  repeat  this  a  million  times  if  necessary:  Your  IP  address  is  worth  GOLD to social media giants like Facebook and YouTube .  Think about the long-term effects of monitoring you for years on end  for a moment .  Your  browser  alone,  never  mind  all  the  leaks  of  data  your  OS  gives, provides all kinds of data on your lifestyle by way of web analytics. Things like where you like to shop, what you say and to whom you say it and how often. Which political or religious forums you frequent. Your pets names. Your hairdresser. Your fixer .  And that's not all. It links your family history on social media sites. It links  your  favorite  book  genres,  your  favorite  sexual  fantasies,  your  eye color. The list goes on and on. Therefore it is most crucial that we hide it as much as possible as we build out our cellular fortress of doom from which nothing can penetrate. If you don't know what Tor is, I highly recommend visiting the Tor website to learn the dirty little details .  The gist of this is that any packet sent by Tor is stripped of the sender's originating  info.  Tor  is  able  to  remove  who  sent  the  packet  and  who  the intended recipient is. Think of it this way :  Imagine you sent an envelope to person A, and in that envelope was an  envelope to send to person B .  - Person A then sends the letter to person B . - B gets the envelope from A, and in that envelope is another envelope  to send to person C .  - Person C gets that envelope from B, then looks up the information that is requested. Then that person sends the response in an envelope addressed to person B .  - Person B puts that in an envelope for A and sends to A, which then  puts it in another envelope to send back to you .  Tor routing works like this, except you also know the public keys for A, B, and C ahead of time, so that when you send a message to person A, the only thing that A can decrypt is the fact you are sending a message to B - only the message itself is still encrypted and only decryptable by Person C . Meanwhile, Person B receives, decrypts, and relays the message to C but never knows you sent it, and C has no idea who you or "A" really is .   If  you're  in  the  United  States,  there's  some  bad  news  to  hear,  and  it's this: Tor is generally safer for citizens that don't live in nations with lots of alphabet agencies  i.e. intelligence  running Tor exit nodes that sniff traffic. If  you're  in  the  USA  and  run  Tor  -  as  long  as  no  one  is  deploying  high statistical traffic-analysis on you, your IP address is generally safe for the session. Given enough resources and time funding, Tor can be not-very-safe if your doing anything illegal .  That said, this leaves a lot to be desired when we need good opsec. So many  ways  exist  that  could  out  your  identity.  If  you  open  Hotmail  for instance  while  surfing  with  Tor,  any  alphabet  agency  can,  with  sufficient resources, correlate that address with Tor activity. Keyloggers can too. They can record keystrokes outside of Tor and send them online to destinations unknown. From Russia with Love. You could even run into a site that has an  XSS  security  hole  and  have  your  identity  stolen  right  out  from  under you. A million things could go wrong .  For  this  reason,  we  need  to  set  a  few  ground  rules  for  using  Tor.  It doesn't  matter  what  you're  using  it  for.  Americans  have  been  arrested  for sarcastic comments left on Facebook. So anything done on Tor must never be connected with any social media outlet. Ever .   10 TOR RULES FOR SMARTPHONE USERS  T he way we go about securing our phone with Tor is to assume everything you  run  is  compromised.  Plug  all  the  holes  so  to  speak.  And  the  basic guidelines are the same .  No Browser Customizations - That is, no customization based on emotional whims. The Tor Browser can't fix your personal imprint that drip-feeds intel onto the net, which leads to your front door in the same way a wolf leaves dribbles of urine back to it's lair. Plugins like Flash, QuickTime and Firefox Personas can reveal your IP address. Load up Firefox with a dozen social media plugins and you can kiss your anonymity goodbye. This also means no YouTube. No Facebook. No Twitter. No LinkedIn . Avoid Chrome and Internet Explorer - There's no reason to use these at all since Tor comes pre-bundled with a very fine- tuned Firefox setup. Chrome isn't built for Tor. It's built for tracking you. That's what Google does. Google didn't build a billion dollar search empire by playing nice. Just as Samsung when they tried to sneak an Adblock-like app into the Play Store. They did reinstate it later, but not without some heavy oversight . Never Open Executables - If I absolutely must run an executable file, pdf or document, I transfer it to memory stick and carry it by hand to a computer that is not online. I then copy paste it to a virtual machine like VMWare with Windows   installed  aka sandboxed  so that if a virus does exist, it's ability to do damage is limited. Think of a nuclear weapon going off underground out in the Nevada desert . Use Tor Bridges - If Tor brings to much heat, use a Bridge Relay. While vanilla Tor does a good job, it's not perfect. It can't prevent an NSA data center with huge resources from doing traffic analysis to determine if your using Tor. If you want to hide the fact you're using Tor, then opt for a Tor Bridge Relay instead of a direct connection to the same Tor entry point everyone else uses . Act Like Everybody Else - Tor relayed this to me that when I maximized Tor Browser :  Maximizing Tor Browser can allow websites to determine your monitor  size, which can be used to track you .  The  solution  is  simple.  Always  use  the  default  options  whenever possible  unless  it  enhances  anonymity,  such  as  disabling  Javascript.  One comment on the Tor Blog illuminates why this is the case :  "Using  an  unusual  screen  resolution  was  sufficient  to  identify  me uniquely to Panopticlick.com. With my portrait mode screen resolution of 1200  wide  by  1920  high,  the  default  window  size  of  1000x1765  was unique , no resizing or maximizing needed ."  A  website  can  find  out  information  about  your  screen  that  includes width,  height,  DPI,  color  depth,  and  even  font  smoothing.  A  1080p resolution isn't so bad, but the worst thing you can do is to resize the Tor browser  to  a  random  size  instead  of  maximizing  it.  Any  adversary  won't have a clue about the hardware you're running, but you'll probably be the only person with that browser size on each site you visit .  This is bad since it means your activity can be tracked - the adversary will know that sites A, B and C were visited by the same person despite the fact that Tor used three different IPs to access those sites .  Therefore, act like everybody else .  Never enter your real information online . Perhaps this is obvious, but don't enter in anything that may reveal your identity online. If asked for your personal details when signing up for a web site, lie .   Take extra caution if you register a domain name . If you want to set up a site of your own, you may be tempted to register your own domain. Be careful. Domain name registrars collect a lot of information and reveal a lot in WHOIS records. If you register a domain name, do so anonymously .   ANONYMOUS ANDROID  S trong anonymity takes a lot of hard work as you'll soon find out. It's like something out of Pandora's Box .  Securing a leaky, soul-stealing privacy-eating gremlin-toothed operating system  like  Android  can  unleash  hell  quite  easily.  And  all  it  takes  is  one mistake, a simple curiosity, a little peek that leads to another, and another and before you know it you're one cocky, self-absorbed son of a gun who can do no wrong when the inevitable happens. You take unnecessary risks . What happens to those on a motorcycle who take risks? Gun owners?  Athletes ?  The  day  you  lose  respect  is  the  day  you'll  wind  up  beneath  an overturned gasoline tanker. Like chess and motorcycles, it's just not an easy platform to master. In fact, Android is a pain in the ass to lock down, a beast that  doesn't  like  chains  and  being  told  what  to  do.  Just  when  you  think you've got her figured out, she shapeshifts .  Changing Android's Hardware  firmware    Y our phone or tablet has two operating systems. One on top, such as iOS or Android, and one beneath that deals with all things radio. That's the beast in  the  basement  we  must  deal  with  if  we  are  to  sail  the  flagship  named Anonymity .  It's housed in firmware and gets its meat from a baseband processor, so it's a little difficult to access without modifications. Make that, dangerous   modifications .  Most of them run on the ARM processor but that's of little consequence since you can replace the Android operating system itself if you so desire. You  can  do  this  by  installing  CyanogenMod  along  with  Team  Win Recovery Project . Required apps : - CyanogenMod - Team Win Recovery Project image - F-Droid package - Orbot from F-Droid - Droidwall from F-Droid - Droidwall Firewall Scripts   HOW TO ACCESS HIDDEN ONION SITES ON THE  DEEP WEB HOW TO ACCESS HIDDEN ONION  SITES ON THE DEEP WEB  O  nion  sites  are  those  sites  with  an  .onion  extension  that  can  only  be reached by using the Tor Browser. You cannot reach them on the open web. Accessing them is just like accessing any other site over the Tor network as long as you know the address .  To that end, Reddit holds a repository of interesting darknet articles and  a massive number of darknet links in the sidebar. You can find it at :  h ttps:  www.reddit.com r  darknetmarkets  D eepDotWeb is another site where you can harvest many .onion addresses. They  even  have  comparison  charts  of  all  the  hidden  sites  that  can  be accessed over Tor, with pros and cons and even reviews of each vendor or outlet,  updated  monthly.  After  installing  Tor  I  recommend  you  set  your homepage to  https:  wtfismyip.com   or  the  Tor  IP  check   check.torproject.org   .  That  ensures  your  IP  is  masked .   LINUX DARKNET EDITION  It  uses   L inux Darknet is just a fancy term for Tails , The Amnesic Incognito Live System.  the  Linux  operating  system  and  comes  highly recommended. Bruce Schneier and Ed Snowden along with a host of other well-known security experts cannot praise it's strengths enough. It's cheap, fast, and untraceable even for those new to the Deep Web. As a matter of fact, it's the perfect incognito tool for doing anything on the Deep Web .  What You Need :  A PC or laptop capable of running a live operating system via USB DVD . A Blank DVD or USB Stick A 4GB Stick for Persistence  In case you want to create a persistent volume in the free space left on the device by Tails Installer. The files in the persistent volume are saved encrypted and remain available across separate working sessions  .  O ne of the great things about Tails is that it forgets everything at shutdown. All files, settings, and RAM are cleared. When you need permanent storage, a  USB  or  SD  card  can  be  used.  More  than  likely  you  will have  sensitive info on this storage, so it should also be encrypted .   How to Setup Tails  W arning : Never run Tails in a Virtual Machine. Doing so jeopardizes your security  as  you  put  yourself  at  the  mercy  of  the  host  operating  system. Whonix is a much better option for this, which I go into detail in my Tor & the  Dark  Art  of  Anonymity  book.  One  reason  is  spelled  out  on  the  Tails website :  "B oth the host operating system and the virtualization software are able to monitor what you are doing in Tails ."  W hich means "If the host operating system is compromised with a software keylogger or other malware, then it can break the security features of Tails ".  Another reason is that traces of your Tails session are likely to be left on the  local  hard  disk.  For  example,  host  operating  systems  usually  use swapping  or paging  which copies part of the RAM to the hard disk .  Download the Tails ISO image from the Tails website . Verify the image  Now choose which to boot from. You've 2 choices: USB or DVD . If DVD : Burn the iso to DVD .  Y ou now need to edit the Boot Order. Depending on your computer you should see an entry for removable drive or USB media. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer to attempt to start from your device before starting from the hard disk. Disable Fast boot and Secure boot, then click save and continue .  You should see the Tails operating system after rebooting. Now feel free to hack the Pentagon to see if Area 51 really was the site of a crashed UFO .   On system shutdown, make sure everything you need is saved either to an external encrypted drive or your Persistence. Upper right corner has the power off button. Click and select shutdown to turn off .  Alternatively: Remove USB to initiate shutdown . Wait for the RAM to be wiped . Done. You have completed a secure session with Tails. Everything not saved has been lost and is irretrievable .  T ails is the most respected privacy app out there for good reason. It leaks the least data of every system in existence and is scrutinized mercilessly . Whonix is also a good choice, but it is less used and thus less scrutinized. Therefore you should use Tails as a starting point on your journey that is the Darknet Marketplace - which we'll descend into next .   BYPASSING WEBSITES THAT BLOCK TOR  I ’ll keep this short and sweet. By now you know that Tor isn’t foolproof, especially on cell phones .  It’s  just  a  lock  on  your  shed  after  all,  a  lock  designed  to  make  you  a harder target than the next guy. Websites know this, even adversarial ones who do not like Tor users .  Plenty of websites will block any IP address associated with Tor, even if it is not an exit node. The sites you want to use may already be listed in there .  But exit nodes are not hidden. In order to hide your Tor usage you need to proxy-chain a VPN so that any traffic coming out isn’t coming from a known Tor node. You can see a list of exit nodes here :  h ttps:  check.torproject.org cgi-bin TorBulkExitList.py?ip=" YOURIP "  I n most cases they may only be able to block the largest and most used exit nodes,  but  if  you  cannot  access  a  particular  website,  use  their  own  tools against them by configuring Tor  via the torrc file  to use an exit node that recently joined the network  up to a few hours or days, whichever you need  .  You’ll sneak into the castle and past the anti-Tor drawbridge because it  takes time for a website to update the Tor block list .   If on the other hand you’d like to setup Tor to only use exit nodes from a specific country  like the USA for example , then you need to look for the torrc file inside the Tor Browser directory  Data Tor   and add this line to the torrc file using a text editor :  ExitNodes {us }   GOVERNMENT TRACKING OF TOR USERS  Can the government track which sites I visit over Tor ?  T or's design document Section 3.1 states :  A global passive adversary is the most commonly assumed threat when analyzing theoretical anonymity designs. But like all practical low-latency systems, Tor does not protect against such a strong adversary .  I f you’ve got three-letter agencies after you and they have a special interest in obtaining your data, it’d be easier to just deliver a payload remotely by way  of  a  keylogger  and,  failing  that,  done  covertly  with  assistance  from local LE where they may send out an unmarked car to initiate surveillance of your property .  These days, especially in the United States, any judge will gladly take the two seconds it requires to sign a subpoena if law enforcement waves a few  colorful  alarm  words  at  them   terrorism,  child  porn,  survivalist gremlins ,  with  many  judges  not  bothering  to  ask  whether  or  not  you’re simply using Tor to help the network out .  For most users, Tor provides the best available protection against a well-  resourced  observer. It's an open question how much protection Tor  or any other existing  anonymous  communications  tool   provides  against  the  NSA's   large-scale  Internet  surveillance.  On  its  own,  Tor  can't  protect  against attacks against vulnerabilities on your computer or its software .  If the adversary is the NSA, a seriously strong SIGINT entity, the best offense is a good defense – being a pain in the neck to target. That’s the goal.  You  must  look  and  act  like  everyone  else  because  it  disrupts  the intelligence-gathering  cycle.  A  well-funded  SIGINT  entity  like  the  NSA won’t  waste  time  going  over  your  cleartext  communications  since  your metadata & ID patterns are good enough. That’s why any agency worth its salt will be much better at targeting than crypto-analysis .  For  this  reason  you  should  always  use  Tor  on  something  other  than  a cell phone if you can help it. Reason being is that they monitor everything they can get their paws on before feeding this data into the beast system for whatever endgame their planning. There’s no doubt anymore on this .  And until the night of the long knives and we see enemies of the state strung up by their feet  like those old black and white photos , there will be no end to data harvesting .  Onionscan may be of some use to check for security holes .   TOR & SMS VERIFICATION  L  ike  the  annoying  buzz  of  a  fly,  Tor  users  have  to  deal  with  SMS verifications to register for a website on occasion. Hidden services as well, it seems, must deal with it, even merchants .  Be  very  careful  with  this.  Optimally  your  threat  model  should  not require  any  such  ‘verification’  outside  the  usual  opsec  tools.  Exposing yourself  by way of a cell  in this way not only grants the media sites you visit  a  nice  gourmet  of  your  metadata,  but  any  network  operator,  law enforcement  or  hacker  may  join  in  for  a  bite  if  you  use  the  same  cell  to login to social media sites. Until we have traceless SMS, I’d avoid that site for anything requiring anonymity .  But for Darknet Marketplaces, take a gander below. It’s a hypothetical scenario  involving  a  Tor  user  who  wants  to  buy  from  a  Black  Market vendor.  Who  cares  what  he  wants  to  buy.  That’s  his  business.  But  the vendor  in  question  has  a  decent  reputation  on  Agora  Marketplace,  so  the customer sends over his PGP info  encrypted of course  .  V endor : That  PGP  data  didn’t  make  it  through.  Use  SMS4Tor  ok?   he sends the link  .  Customer : I’ll just resend PGP using the profile key you gave . Vendor : Still ain’t workin, pal. Dunno why not cuz you ordered last  Customer: Last week? Wasn’t me as I’ve never ordered from you. Will  you resend that public key again so I can import it  again  and re-send ?  week .   Vendor: Methinks you’re using a different PGP app. Same as last week.   he then issues more demands    N otice anything off about the above conversation? I do. The vendor is an incompetent clown. Two PGP apps not compatible? That’s something either a  cop  or  hacker  might  say  to  get  more  information   i.e.  fishing .  It’s  the same tactic Homeland Security uses when they infiltrate chat rooms and try to fish for some new meat who’s a first-time buyer .  Whether  incompetence  comes  by  way  of  a  hacker  or  an  incompetent stooge  vendor,  never  jeopardize  your  safety  by  assuming  they  are  just having an ‘off day’ and blow it off. Follow your gut, always. If something doesn’t smell right, RUN .   TOR PRANKS & CELL PHONES  T here are a lot of bored college students out there who believe Tor makes for  one  seriously  strong  suit  of  armor  against  any  and  all  would-be opponents, and an invisible one at that. An invisible knight is, well, pretty formidable foe. Maybe these jesters just feel they were born in the wrong century. Regardless, we can learn a lot from their folly. You, o’ anonymous traveler,  must  use  the  gift  of  discernment  to  rightly  divide  fantasy  from reality because what works in the world of Faerun doesn’t squire well with the real world .  A Harvard kid decided he wasn’t quite prepared for final exams, so he emailed  a  bomb  threat  to  get  out  of  taking  them.  He  used  Tor  and  a throwaway  email  account  to  cover  his  online  footprint,  only  little  did  he know that all the school officials had to do was search through the campus lab’s logs to discern who accessed Tor at that time. It led them straight to his dorm room .  It probably didn’t help that he used Harvard’s WiFi to access Tor. He  was the only one who did at that particular time .  If you are at a Mardi Gras party and everyone else has removed their masks except you, you’re going to stand out. If you want to be anonymous, then use tools that enable you to look like everyone else when everyone else is using it . Our Harvard friend did not. Imagine yourself paying cash for something small. Cash is considered king for anonymity but can backfire if you’re the only one using it to pay for a brand new Camaro in a 200 mile radius .  Recall what Kevin Mitnick  hacker wanted by the FBI  said upon his arrest; that Tsutomu Shimomura, a computer security expert, had broken the   ‘rules’  by  helping  the  Feds  nab  him  instead  of  relying  on  his  technical expertise  –  and  nothing  else.  He  thought  it  a  game  and  any  attack  vector would come through Tor and Tor alone. For this reason you mustn’t think of anonymity as some fantasy game with a ruleset. Cops do not play by the rules. They play dirty. They break the rules. They break the law. Then they break you because you think they are confined by their own laws. Only they are not .  Any  action,  especially  a  cell  phone  prank  like  that  of  our  Harvard genius,  leaves  breadcrumbs  for  others  to  follow.  When  you  use  WiFi  at Starbucks for example, then you are there in the flesh doing the deed and in well range of CCTV surveillance. There are fingerprints on your coffee cup; the same you pitched into the trashcan alongside your slightly used comb .  So blend in to the detriment of comfort. Avoid layers of anonymity that produce  complex  requirements  yet  produce  more  visibility.  Ninjas  in ancient Japan did not look like the sort of ninja Chuck Norris went toe to toe against in The Octagon .  They didn’t wear black pajamas. They looked like your neighborly rice farmer, one among dozens of other rice farmers. Sort of like SAS wearing burkas to sneak into ISIS HQ .   BLACK MARKETS ON THE DEEP WEB  H ere are a  few  things  you  can  buy  on  the  Deep  Web  you  may  not  have heard about .  Rare Opsec Manuals for Survivalists Rare Special Ops Guides 3D Printed Guns and Bullets Drugs for Cancer Japanese Manga Books on How to Overthrow Governments  Top Darknet Markets  T  HERE  ARE  two  types  of  Blackmarket  Drug  emporiums  on  the  Deep Web. Those you trust and those you don't. Below is a list of some of the more popular black market outlets. One or two may be gone already by the time this book goes to press. In five years all of them may be gone. The point here isn't to steer you into any one of these in particular or even that I want you to buy illegal drugs  I don't , but to remind you that none of these sites will last forever just as Google and Microsoft won't last forever .  Something will come along to replace the behemoths just as surely the same as AltaVista, Infoseek, Napster and Divx were replaced. It can happen   quick. My grandfather's motto: Never gamble or invest more than you can afford to lose .  Agora Marketplace  Established: Dec 3, 2013  Invite  Required    Abraxas Market  Established: Dec 13, 2014  Invite  Required     Established: Dec 22, 2014  Taken down by the FBI in 2017  Established: Nov 15, 2013  Invite  Required    Nucleus Market  Established: Nov 24, 2014   Established: Apr 28, 2015  Established: Dec 29, 2013  Established: Dec 22, 2014  Middle Earth Marketplace  Established: Jun 22, 2014   Established: Apr 26, 2015  Established: Unknown  The Russian Anonymous Marketplace  aka RAMP    Established: Unknown   MARKETPLACE INVITES  Y  ou  may  have  noticed  that  a  handful  of  these  markets,  such  as  Agora, require invites . What this means is if you're a new buyer or vendor or even just a nosy parker lurking around, you cannot register without an invite link from an already registered user. That's just how it is with some of the more established outlets .  Also, don't assume that because a website's been around longer than the others that it is more secure, and never assume that a closed door means it is closed  forever,  or  for  even  a  long  time.  At  Agora  for  instance,  you'll sometimes see this error :  "Cannot register at this time, user limit reached. Please wait until full  time release ."  It's  confusing  because  it's  meant  to  be.  They  try  to  be  as  cryptic  as possible to throw off anyone looking to take them down. The first option is to either sit tight for a few hours and give the server time to catch it's breath, or ...  - Visit the forum of the marketplace you're trying to reach and ask for an  invite. Failing this, you can  - Visit the Reddit subforum of the market in question . Two points to say on this . First, if you're using a long term account and login using Tor, then your activity can build a profile of sorts, all based on what you do on the Reddit site. Tor can't really prevent this from happening so if you want to preserve your  anonymity  ,  you  must  keep  your  'real'  identity  and  'hidden'  identity completely  separate.  One  way  is  to  never  log  into  any  account  with  both identities .   The second point about Reddit is merely a suggestion : Beware of phishing links there, both on related as well as non-Darknet related subreddits. I'd not recommend using any link in any subreddit, for example, unless you recognize it. Many are plagued with phishing links that comprise  more  than  half  of  the  help  desk's  'can't  login  with  password' topics. All referral links are safe as long as the link begins with the official Agora URL. Anything else is likely a phishing link. And the person whose referral link you use doesn't get any "notifications" or anything letting them know you used it, nor can they see how many people used their link. You are completely anonymous to them .  If you can remember two phone numbers, then you can remember 16- characters for an official link. If you still can't be bothered, there's a third option .  3.   Visit  clearnet  sites  that  spell  out  where  the  site  is  and  even  have rating systems in place. One such place is DarknetMarkets.org , but there are others you can Google for yourself that will also have the forum .onion address you need to access them .  Just be warned that they, like many hidden servers across the Deep Web, come and go like the tide. Some will even change their .onion address for security reasons and some will go down as felled trees because of DDOS attacks, hacking attempts or that gut feeling you get when the spider you threw behind the dresser in the wee morning hours is now looking at you from  across  the  room  like  he  wants  to  skate  down  your  spine  with  a flamethrower .  In other words, always assume someone is watching .   THE BLACKMARKET SUPERLIST  I f you're curious about what other sites exist further down the rabbit hole, you can find the Superlist at :  h ttps:  i.reddit.com r DarkNetMarkets wiki  superlist  I t's a list of "all currently known, operating markets and tumblers" with the disclaimer that "all markets listed should not be taken as endorsements or confirmation  by  the  moderators  that  a  market  is  trusted.  Always  confirm links before you use them ."  Requirements for this superlist are as follows :  The Market must have been up for at least a week after announcing themselves on Reddit's Darknet Market page . The Market has to have at least 20 listings from active vendors . Their service must have at least 50% uptime over the span of a week, under moderator discretion . Users must be able to withdraw their bitcoins  or other relative currency  .   DARKNET DICTIONARY AND OTHER DARKNET  TOOLS  I f some of the technical words in these chapters confuse you  and I readily admit to throwing them around like Mardi Gras beads , don't despair. Check out  DeepDotWeb's  Darknet  Dictionary  on  various  terms  and  phrases.  It's really  a  godsend  because  even  the  most  ardent  and  astute  darknet administrator  doesn't  know  everything  there  is  to  know  about  the  Deep Web. You can find this dictionary at  h ttps:  www.deepdotweb.com 2014 03 02 deepdotwebs-darknet- dictionary     SHIPPING & RECEIVING: THOU SHALT NOTS  W hat  follows  are  a  few  pearls  of  wisdom  from  which  you  may  benefit, chief among them being the use of your real-life details; things like your name, address, phone number, Facebook profile, what have you, that many newbies  pass  around  like  skittles.  Too  much  transparency  can  be catastrophic  to  any  Darknet  Marketplace  or  even  a  single  purchase, especially when dealing with a place like Agora .  If the doorbell rings and you give the delivery guy a fake name, a warning bell is going to go off in his head that you're the next Silk Road admin looking to fill his coffers. He knows your real name already, so don't lie unless you want him to file a report. If your wife has sticky fingers from opening your mail, buy a private box at the UPS store or post office . It's okay to use a fake name if you've got the credentials to back it up. Fake passports can be bought online as gag gifts that wouldn't fool a TSA officer but would fool the mailman and maybe even the UPS store employee. I rented one in Canada and the female employee looked to be no older than 23 years old. She wasn't very observant with details. They won't call the cops on you either way . Agora cannot send Amazon drones to deliver your package. Therefore you need to realize that sensitive materials requiring anonymous services take longer. If you order in December,   expect a delay but don't pester the help desk people unless it's been two weeks since you ordered. For every commonsense person out there who can follow instructions, there's a million pigeons who have the solution right under their beaks. The solution is a little dove called Patience . Use PGP for any and all messages. This is because your address is connected with a Darknet Marketplace and by extension, a vendor who sells items of dubious legality. A hundred things can go wrong. One being the site can be imaged by police with your fancy cul-de-sac address being front and center along with every sentence you've uttered  use short sentences! . A few vendors won't even talk to you if you refuse to encrypt. So use GPG4USB to save yourself the rejection slips. It only takes 20 minutes to learn . Bitcoin Tumblers . Assuming you bought Bitcoins connected to your real-life identity, you should wash or 'tumble' them BEFORE you buy. That means putting those coins through a tumbler like Coinbase first before any depositing goes on at the Agora address. If you withdraw from Agora, it's the reverse procedure :  A gora account to tumbler to Coinbase and then into your Bitcoin Wallet .  Which Bitcoin Tumblers, you ask? Well, the most stable ones you can find. For 2016 onward, Grams Helix Light is the top choice, al though you're hit with a 2.5% fee for the total cost. BitBlender is also a good choice but they require account setups. SharedCoin is yet another but I found it makes it harder to figure out who sent bitcoins to what address. It uses a different method of relaying than the others. This is primarily for small buyers, not for someone looking to pack a warehouse with marijuana bricks in Chicago, Illinois . It may come to pass that you've ordered something and haven't received it yet. It's been ages. Have you been scammed? Locked   out of your account? Or maybe your bitcoins never showed up in your Agora account? Don't fall on your sword just yet. What you need to do is message the market admins, not any forum at Ars Technica or Reddit or anyplace else, and send a  private  message to 'Agora' detailing your problem. The backlog of tickets is considerable but they will get back to you in 48 hours, usually. They tend to bump you further down the priority list if you go overboard and start issuing threats, however, so don't burn any bridges by giving them any catitude .   TO FINALIZE EARLY OR NOT?  I explored this topic in my Tor and the Dark Art of Anonymity book and I'll mention it here, albeit briefly .  Opsec  lessons  can  be  costly.  Finalize  Early,  which  means  you  pay  a vendor before you receive the magical goods, can wreck your life like none other. In general you should avoid ever doing this since the risks alone will give you an ulcer .  Many  before  you  can  attest  to  getting  ripped  off  to  the  tune  of  five figures or more. Vendors can build up trust a long time before they bolt with the  bitcoins,  a  scheme  called  Exit  Scamming.  That's  when  the  vendor,  a sneering twirly-mustached little man works his black magic and makes off with the loot. Your loot .  Newcomers like to trust them implicitly not to rip them off, until they do. Then they spam Usenet, Reddit, Ars Technica and every other tech site with doom and gloom as though said evil man set off a tactical nuke in New Jersey .  Amazon,  eBay  and  Newegg  all  have  trackable  systems  in  place  that, when  linked  with  those  utilized  by  credit  card  companies  and  banks,  can save  your  hide  and  get  you  your  stolen  funds  back.  Sometimes.  Darknet Marketplaces  don't  however.  If  you  get  robbed  then  it's  highly  likely  you won't  be  getting  your  money  back  and  you'll  likely  not  be  alone  in  that regard .  400  positive  feedbacks  sounds  like  a  lot  of  happy  customers.  Only  it isn't.  A  vendor  with  thousands  of  deals  under  his  belt  would  be  a  lot  of happy customers IF he has a good rating to boot and IF you've done your research, but even then it doesn't justify losing every coin you own .   INTERNATIONAL VS. DOMESTIC ORDERS  P  ride  goeth  before  destruction,  and  an  haughty  spirit  before  a  fall  - Proverbs 16:18  I always like to remember that verse when I travel overseas. It's to remind myself not to get too cocky in foreign markets .  Do you travel overseas? Have a passport? Bank cards? Email? Imagine that every day you wake up every little thing that happens to you has to be looked  at  with  suspicion.  Emails  from  family.  Your  new  girlfriend. Whenever the phone rings. That's what it is to be a slave, a slave to your own ego .  You  may  think  there's  something  magical  about  buying  illegal  items from international ports of call. Don't believe the hype. It's the same tune but  with  twice  the  headache.  Whether  international  falls  into  the  "Thou Shalt"  or  "Shalt  Not"  category  is  up  to  you  of  course,  but  how  many migraines do you want? One lump or twenty? Can you lose it all without losing your sanity? Do you want it quick or safe and secret ?  Turkey and the Netherlands brings with it more potency but increased security.  Increased  security  means  higher  risk.  Higher  risk  means  more intense pain .  Content  from  these  exotic  locales  draw  unwanted  attention  and  stand out  from  other  packages  unless  some  extensive  pre-made  cover  has  been setup. Australia comes to mind. It's riskier than other places. The biggest risk is where the Deep Web intersects with the international Real World -   and getting the stuff delivered to you - and keeping you and your family safe .  A few pointers :  NEVER check the status of a package through Tor. Packages tracked via Tor are automatically flagged . Never send contraband from a state where it is legal  i.e. Colorado  . If you're a vendor, never plaster your site with the word "Cheap!!" and then try and slide in heavy shipping costs at the last second. Customers hate that . Don't use first.last@gmail.com as your email address, as other dumb people have  though granted Ross didn't know he was creating a Black Market Amazon, nor did he have any knowledge of the Snowden Prism Lolsec revelations  . No teams. EVERYONE cooperates or you can't operate = not likely. Also, any website that must rely on distribution via US mail is going to have a very bad day. Couriers are better .  A n international buy is much the same as domestic except it comes with substantially higher risk and has the added value that you can be extradited to the other country after the U.S asset forfeiture laws clean your carcass of any link to humanity - assuming there's anything left since the U.S.A is the prison capitol of the world .   Now I'm off to finally get those rocket launchers in my car reloaded .    BLACK MARKET ARRESTS  W e've seen what happens with money and ego. One always prevails over the other. Watch the film Heat starring Al Pacino. One guy on the team of thieves, the new guy, gets everyone else killed or close to it. His bad opsec destroys  everyone  else's  good  opsec;  the  rotten  apple  or  yeast  parable applies here: A little bad ruins the whole dough .  There's  one  site  I  found  quite  informative  in  this  department.  It  lists every black market arrest imaginable. Interestingly the list omits a glaring data  set:  one  that  involves  each  darknet  market  operator's  OPSEC  - admittedly hard to quantify. Take Silk Road for instance. From the link we can deduce that opsec just isn't that high a priority for some users .  "N o single theme emerges reading through the many arrests. Some people are busted through sheer bad luck in being randomly pulled over or their packages inspected; some are undone by other peoples’ mistakes, and some have no one but themselves to blame for talking to a policeman and blurting out all their secrets; some are undone by their trust in others, and some are undone  by  lying  to  federal  agents;  some  are  undone  by  signing  for packages, while others are undone by a stray fingerprint; some followed the OPSEC  rules  and  some  engaged  in  mind-boggling  follies  like  using  their real  return  address  or  accepting  payment  to  their  own  bank  account  or running their own clearnet site; some clammed up, denied everything, and saved  themselves,  while  others  kept  records  of  everything   perhaps  in  the misguided  belief  it  would  earn  them  clemency  in  the  worst   and  only   condemned  themselves;  some  were  busted  at  home,  others  in  the totalitarian zones of international borders; some were busted through high- tech  browser-based  deanonymization,  but  most  through  low-tech  methods like  a  customer  or  friend  snitching;  some  sellers’  packages  are  spotted during Customs inspections, and some are noticed only when delivery fails & the bogus return addresses explode ."   OPSEC FOR BUYERS  M ark Twain once said, "I  don't  like  to  commit  myself  about  heaven  and hell. You see, I have friends in both places ."  O  PSEC  is  more  important  than  anything  else  when  it  comes  to  buying Darknet product. You can never have enough, so it's a little like ammo. If you  were  in  Ukraine  when  the  Soviets  invaded  would  you  be  better  off playing the part of sniper or just cutting bait and running? Sometimes you just have to do both. Allow me to run through a few truths that make this a little more applicable .  Your Machine is Your Fortress  T or is a fine tool for playing cloak and dagger with small purchases, but it isn't  suitable  for  large  orders  or  running  from  the  FBI.  Given  what's happened in the U.S. and UK over the last 5 years even small orders may be detrimental  to  your  freedom.  And  free  speech.  Government  bureaucrats have all but guaranteed they respect neither the Constitution nor our laws .  So  then.  What  can  we  learn  from  Silk  Road?  Well  first  off,  there's evidence  that  Silk  Road's  servers  were  misconfigured  and  revealing  IP addresses and that they were doing it repeatedly. The index page gave away the IP address for several minutes via a print_r debug message printed to   every  requesting  browser.  That's  the  online  goofs,  but  you  can  screw  up offline, too .  Silk Road Lessons  1 .  Your encryption keys to your drives are as sacred as your PGP keys. Do not give them out. Not to your roommate, your girlfriend or your mother, and especially not to your friends. Not even your business partner Eddie .  2 .  Leave your PC unattended at your own peril. With your OS booted and up  and  running,  anyone  from  thieves  to  cops  to  jealous  girlfriends  can access anything on your hard drive that isn't nailed as tight as a coffin  i.e. encrypted containers  .  3 .  Talk at your own PERIL. That is, never mention darknet marketplaces to anyone. Feign ignorance. While you needn't do a disappearing act like Bilbo  Baggins  did,  telling  one  person  will  almost  always  have  the  same effect  as  telling  a  dozen  people,  all  strangers.  And  it  almost  always  is valuable to someone, somewhere .  4  .   Keep  your  Darknet  Marketplace  username pass  under  lock  and  key. Write it down in a text file but encrypt it with Veracrypt or PGP. No stickies .  5 .  Use different username passwords for different markets .   PSYCH TRICKS  T he following are merely suggestions, nothing more, and are more apt to apply to creative types over say, mathematicians .  M  usic  :  Certain  kinds  of  music  reproduce  specific  kinds  of  behavior. Stephen King listens to AC DC when he writes. He cranks it up. Personally I feel an aneurism coming on if I try to write to that. So I listen to Steve Roach,  ambient  composer  with  titles  like  Dreamtime  Return  and  Early Man. Dreamy wispy music. It works. If I switch it up then I lose focus and get distracted too easily .  L ight Darkness : In almost every scene in The Matrix, Neo can be seen always  working  in  the  dark.  Even  his  display  glows  a  matrix-green  with cryptic  lettering,  the  only  brightness  in  the  room  being  that  of  his monochrome  skin.  Works  for  me  too.  Almost  like  a  sensory-deprivation chamber and it's amazing how much better I sleep because of it .  L ocale : Stephen King once said that you don't need a glamorous 'study' to write good stories. You just need something familiar. And he's right. Having traveled to a few countries I can tell you that writing in a new city every week is not remotely possible for me as there's just too many distractions.   You need a spot like Neo did - a place your identity always goes but never goes outside of either by doorway or otherworldly portal .  D rugs : Caffeine, nicotine, sugar highs, but no prescription drugs. They put me in a state of mind that gets reinforced daily, though I do toss and turn at night. Alcohol, Stephen King once stated, helps immensely with epic fiction writing but kills you in the process. I can vouch for that .  S cents : My girlfriend used to light caramel candles to scent up the room whenever she'd come over from the ER, usually when I was just finishing up  a  mindblowing  chapter.  After  the  breakup  I  had  trouble  finishing chapters .  T he point of all of this is this: the more opsec you employ on a daily basis, the  more  your  brain  will,  IF  put  into  action,  develop  an  opsec-focused mindset  that  doesn't  have  to  be  turned  on  every  day.  It  just  kicks  in. Automatic. Razor sharp as piranha teeth. It does this because it's burned in like ram on a motherboard. Like pushing a button to boot Linux, you open your eyes and it's there, waiting for orders. It'll be there especially when any dangerous  developments  present  themselves.  Develop  and  hone  this  and you won't mistake that woodpecker at 6 AM for a group of angry white-hot stormtroopers .  Engaging in shady deals is a little like gambling. The house always wins if you keep playing. If you can't work the opsec well then the only winning move, as Matthew Broderick found out in Wargames, is not to play. If you continue  to  play  recklessly,  it'll  be  tough  to  find  a  lawyer  who  takes payment in bitcoins .   VENDOR OPSEC  Y  ou  get  what  you  pay  for,  and  playing  cheap  gets  expensive  if  you're caught.  For  any  Tor  hidden  server  operator,  that  means  never  letting  the reins fall into someone else's hands. Not your associates, your girlfriend or cousin Eddie because it's you and you alone they're coming after, lock stock and barrel .  One torpedo can wipe out an entire battleship and they only have to get lucky once. You can't afford a lucky strike, so you as captain need to sense when something's 'off' so you can pull the plug without having to explain why.  Partners  will  demand  to  know  why  of  course,  but  it's  better  to  run silent and deep .  Ross Ulbricht failed in this department. But we can learn a lot from his  mistakes .  Looking through the court details of his arrest one gets the impression that he was not only lax in basic IT security, but that he knew nothing about how  search  engines  track  users  at  all.  So  Lady  Luck  never  really  had  to come into the FBI's playbook at all. The guy was just sloppy and might as well have slapped on the cuffs himself .  Ross  was  caught  long  before  Silk  Road  grew  mega-popular.  Court documents reveal security mistakes that a rookie drug dealer on Miami Vice might  have  made,  not  someone  in  charge  of  a  multi-million  dollar  Deep Web drug operation. Here are a few of Ross's opsec blunders .   Advertising openly on the Bitcoin Talk forum that he needed an IT guy for a hidden Tor service - and then using his real name for a Gmail address and his Silk Road Wordpress site, a site he connected to from outside of Tor . Ross's Google Plus account connected to his Gmail with a list of his favorite Austrian economic theory videos, the same theories he'd bragged about using for Silk Road on more than one clearnet forum . Using code for SilkRoad from a public programming site  i.e. StackOverflow , from an account never accessed with Tor with his IP address being out in the open for months. Any law enforcement official could track these breadcrumbs at their leisure . Using his real identity on LinkedIn, with links to Silk Road musings on his Wordpress blogs .  T hese are just some of the mistakes he made, to say nothing about his lax hidden  server  settings.  Besides  these,  there's  a  lot  to  be  said  for  smart vendors who know good security .  Vendor Guidelines Part I  T hese are just like the buyer opsec rules, except in reverse. Short and sweet .  Use a sanitized laptop, cash bought, with only a Linux distro configured to run Tor and only Tor, with no other outgoing connections allowed . Dissolving your real-life persona and using different usernames on every forum visited with no non-Tor IP addresses exposed . Not residing in the USA. This is a big one . No ordering of fake IDs in the USA  vendors only  or any other contraband that'd raise suspicion with authorities .   Vendor Guidelines, Part II  Y ou've read this far and want to be a vendor, or at least know what it takes to be one and not get caught  cue Miami Vice theme  .  This is very shady territory .  Mostly  illegal.  The  risks  here  carry  an awful lot of pain if you screw it up, and it's far more pain than what the Shady Acres Homeowner Association would give you for not curbing your dog .  There's no accidents here . No 'accidentally' slipping on rings found in dark, damp caves. No 'but I was only looking for UFOs' excuses. Success in the black arts tends to fuel a  life  of  it's  own  much  like  Sauron's  ring  of  Power.  It's  knowledge  that wants to be abused. Before we discuss the criminal element, let's discuss the business side of things .  You have to be a businessman. If you're smart you should consider investing $500 and take an introduction course at the university. Do it online. You'll need to know the ins and outs of mail-order, accounts and ledgers  and when to dispose of them , and how to replenish your products. Doing it all anonymously raises the difficulty by a factor of ten. It's hard work even when it's legal products . Sell fakes at first. Cubic zirconium rings. Flour. Fake credit cards. Not to real customers but to yourself , and long before any real product matures . Money talks. Invest in a site that charges a fee for vendors. People take you seriously when they know you've got startup capital . Create a Dark Persona. This is the hardest part of all, as this person must be the opposite of the real You in every detail: Politics. Sexual taste. Movies. Style. Age. Locale. Accent. If you're confused on what this means, watch The Matrix. Neo lives two lives and the Agents know it. It's why it was so hard to track him down. One is a hacker who specialized in obtaining contraband and the other works in a respected software company and  in my best Agent Smith impression ... helps his landlady take out her garbage .   Like Neo your offline security should get Top Billing, meaning the little pigtailed girl across the street should not think of you as 'that quiet, creepy dude who's cat Lucifer wails like a police siren at dinnertime' and keeps her up at night. They need to think positive thoughts .  They should trust you but not know too much. They only need to never suspect  anything  shady  is  going  on  -  that  you're  good  at  fixing  broken computers,  bikes  and  love  big  dogs  but  you'd  never  do  anything  to  hurt anyone. Never anything to do with any of the following: Tor. PGP. Freenet. I2P. Darkcoins. Especially Darkcoins or whatever flavor of the month they come in since they too change like the wind .  Pay cash for everything . Avoid social media outlets like the Black Plague . You know the ones . Facebook.  Twitter.  YouTube.  Instagram.  Pinterest.  These  are  locales polluted with diseased gossip that'll turn any normal person into a zombie walker given enough time with an unrooted cell phone .  Neighbors  gossip  mainly  about  those  they  don't  know.  They  fill  in empty  gaps  with  guesses  and  nonsense  and  sometimes  outright  lies.  To prevent this, go to social engagements or pop in at backyard BBQs and be the one that has the best fireworks on the 4th of July, the same who bought expensive beer for everyone .  Be a volunteer at a shelter. A no-kill cat shelter. The Salvation Army. It doesn’t really matter what as long as your neighbors think you’re ‘Nice Guy Eddie ’.  Help the neighborhood kids find their lost dog by going door to door with  his  pug  mugshot  you  ripped  off  the  telephone  pole.  Find  him  and they'll  forgive  you  for  accidentally  launching  a  nuclear  weapon  in  a Pentagon hack attempt  not possible by the way  .  You get busted, you'll want these people to speak up for you. Do all of the above and they'll form a standing army at your beck and call. Just never mention Tor, PGP and the rest, not even to dear old Dad who you can be quite certain will brag at every BBQ you go to that you're Snowden's long lost brother .  Change PGP keys frequently if and when your business grows. Avoid using  any  of  your  own  handwriting  on  anything.  Neither  your  name, address, favorite colors, nicknames you use on various forums .  Research the following :   Cashing Bitcoins Mail Anonymity Stealth Stealth Materials Competitive Pricing Customer  Service   i.e.  How  to  keep  your  customers  coming  back  for  Sales  copywriting.  Read  Cashvertising,  a  book  on  writing  copy  for  Research the best lawyer to have for whatever it is you're selling .  more  .  anything .   POSTAL DROPS & CONTROLLED DELIVERIES  N  ow  for  the  real  black  market  opsec.  The  first  topic  we'll  discuss  is controlled deliveries, a term used by those on both sides of the law .  What's a controlled delivery ? It's  a  way  for  law  enforcement  to  dupe  you  into  accepting  a  package containing  illegal  goods.  It  could  be  anything.  Drugs.  Guns.  Japanese manga that involves underage 'cat' girls. All in the hopes you'll accept the package and make some off-the-cuff remark about the contents. They hope . Then they can search your house. They need only establish you knew the package was coming, what it contained or what you intended on doing with it. Smoking it, of course, but one out of three is usually sufficient to get a search warrant. Let's dispense with a few myths first prior to counter- surveillance techniques .  Myth 1: If a person receives any type of contraband in the mail, he can  be arrested on the spot. Guilt by association .  FALSE . If receiving anything illegal in the mail is enough to send a guy to the Big House with Bubba, every school bully in existence could get sent up the  creek  by  just  ordering  a  few  Scooby  sheets  of  LSD  to  his  house.  It doesn't work that way. The police need proof that you know what's inside, otherwise it's a no-win case and they know it. If you're a cool level-headed, logical thinking kind of guy like Mr. Orange in Reservoir Dogs then they've got a problem. If they see your stone-cold blue eyes are filled with an Iron Man resolve, then they know their only recourse is to get you to flap your gums  before  the  adrenaline  'fight  or  flight'  rush  wears  off.  To  this  end,   there's a couple of effective ways they'd like to deal with you. Both involve deception .  The first is by taking the 'Nice Guy' approach. You'd be shocked at how well  they  can  get  a  stranger  to  spill  his  guts  by  playing  up  the  nice  guy angle. Be his friend so to speak. His father confessor .  When  the  heat  is  on  and  you've  got  a  few  stormtroopers  stomping around  your  house  with  muddy  boots,  well,  you  want  them  to  leave.  I would too. And that's what they tell you. We'll leave, they'll say. Then the dirty  tricks  start.  They  make  any  newbie  want  to  talk  if  only  to  relieve stress. Only he ends up spending years in prison instead of a measly three stinking days because he never kept his mouth shut .  Police officers and DEA agents in particular have had years to perfect  the art of persuasion by deception. That means lying their ass off .  If you've ever seen Black Hawk Down then you know how ferocious a night raid can be, where they may have to 'clear' a house by going room to room and scaring the living hell out of anyone living there. It's scary stuff. The cat's smart enough to hide under the bed but Rover gets shot in the leg .  But it doesn't always go down that way . You're usually seated in cuffs when the nice guy routine kicks into high gear. That's what they want to try first. Nice guy then mean guy and not the other way around since it's far easier to upgrade then to downgrade on the poor sap's emotions. Police usually say something like this .  "We only want the dealer, not you kid. Look, you're small time. We know it and you know it and your supplier knows it. You're useless to us. But your partner, your boss, he's the one we're after. The Big Fish. The Don. We see your family here and understand your situation, we've got our own. You're poor.  You  wanted  to  escape  for  an  hour,  maybe  two.  That's  all.  We understand.  No  trouble  for  you  if  you  cooperate  and  tell  us  your  source. Where'd you get these drugs from ?"  You give Barney Fife a long silence as you fidget and glance around the room at where your hidden stash is. They'll say, "Talk so we can go home and you can get back to playing The Witcher on your laptop over there."  This  is  the  part  where  they'll  lie  and  say  they're  fans  of  the  game themselves  .  Should you talk ? Can they be trusted ?   Then out of nowhere, when they see the synapses firing in your brain that  tell  you  to  keep  your  big  trap  shut,  they  bring  out  the  'Bad  Guy' routine. Nice Guy's evil twin brother whose tone sounds an awful lot like the mouth of Sauron in the Lord of the Rings .  "Look kid, you're life's over. You're done. Cooked. You'll lose your kids in the next room over and your job and your car and your house and maybe even your cat sitting under the bed. She'll be put to sleep long before you get out of jail. Unless you just give us the name so we can cut you some slack, kid ."  What's the first thing that's going to pop into your head if you're new to  this ?  You want these clowns out of the house. Yesterday . You want a clean rep so the family doesn't think you're Jabba the Hutt . You want to believe them. They're dressed nice after all. Clean shaven. Shiny boots. Nice haircut. But then so was the Terminator when he went looking for Sarah Connor and her rebellious pain-in-the-ass son .  Bottom line: Don't fall for any of their lies. You see, when you're raided at some ungodly hour say at 6 AM, all the blood in your system goes to your legs and arms and you get what's called brain drain . You become a moron.  A  Ferengi  or  drunk  Klingon  say  instead  of  a  logical  Vulcan  who thinks clearly and invokes that God-given gift to all men called discernment .  It's  fight  or  flight  time  and  the  cops  know  most  people  won't  use  their brains at 6AM because they're used to seeing scrambled eggs. They'd rather fight, run away or just sign on the dotted line to shut em up so they'll leave, leave, LEAVE !  Don't  let  this  happen.  It's  like  walking  right  into  Hell  with  both  eyes  wide open .  Don't talk to cops. Don't sign anything. Don't agree to anything . Oh  but  you  say  you'd  end  up  in  jail?  You'll  end  up  there  anyway regardless of what they tell you, only what they don't tell you is that 90% of the  time,  if  you  keep  your  trap  shut  ,  the  prosecutor'll  drop  the  case  for insufficient  evidence.  Most  evidence  comes  from  a  confession,  not  from what the cops see or pick up on site .   box .  Therefore  never  admit  to  a  thing  nor  sign  any  'apology'  letter  or anything  else.  Note  that  they'll  try  to  get  a  confession  before  taking  you down to the station. That's the whole point .  Myth  2: You Should Always Use a Fake Name or ID for a postal  FALSE . We briefly mentioned this one a few chapters ago, but it bears repeating. Whether you're using a UPS Store rental box or the post office, never ever use  a  fake  ID  or  a  false  name.  If  one  package  of  yours  becomes compromised then you could be looking at a worse situation on account that they will know you lied. It'll look suspicious. Probable cause is much more likely  a  given  if  they  know  you're  a  liar.  Be  honest  with  non-law enforcement types. Honesty and silence work hand in hand but if you lied at some point along the way it'll be hard for you to deny any bad intentions with the rented box .  After 9 11 fake IDs get you into heaps of trouble these days, but doubly so  for  ordering  darknet  stuff.  Now  they're  linked  to  everything  from terrorism  to  identity  theft  to  Silk  Road-level  drug  empires.  So  in  light  of this, use your real name .  MYTH 3: Retrieve the package quick! Before anyone notices ! ALSO  FALSE.  You  need  to  let  it  sit  for  a  couple  of  days  if  at  all possible. This is because the package is still 'hot'. Granted, police don't have unlimited funding that allows them to survey the store 24 7 365 days a year, even for a small fish who needs a break. But if any bust is going down it'll likely happen fast .  From there you can take it to a neutral spot and open it somewhere safe. Or  you  could  wait  a  few  days  later  to  add  that  extra  layer  of  plausible deniability about the contents of the package. Again this goes back to our opsec mindset and living out that opsec mindset day to day, hour to hour, by taking action beforehand. That is, having a clear plan ahead of time as well as a Plan B, a Plan C, etc .   ESCAPING THE WEST!  D  isclaimer:  Note  that  it's  now  a  serious  felony   at  least  in  the  U.S.   to resort to this method. 9 11 changed everything. Your mileage may vary .  T he gauntlet's been thrown down. The challenge issued. You've got about six months to cash in a few assets to get your money and your sorry-you- ever-married-a-Toronto-girl  hide  out  of  Dodge  for  good  or  else  a  court judgment will fly down like a bolt of lightning from Zeus to your arse that'll leave you wailing like those alley cats on Bourbon Street .  You've been over it a thousand times. If you don't hightail it you just know  a  police  cruiser  will  be  along  at  any  moment  to  arrest  you  for whistling a copyrighted tune out your backside - and then you'll be seeing red-blue flashbacks with every trip to the john .  Six months. Six months . What's a decent guy to do? How do you start a brand new life abroad with  only  a  U.S.  passport  and  less  than  a  hundred  grand  to  your  name? Where do you go and how do you prevent a tail? Is the IRS's long reach an urban  myth?  Student  loans?  Child  support  for  that  illegal  you  shagged  in Phoenix ?  Extradition  laws  vary  but  you've  little  desire  to  learn  Thai  or Vietnamese and zero will to fight off the Zeta cartel's pack of little league brigade in Monterray. You need an escape plan .  Let's assume you've no qualms about breaking any further laws at this point.  Being  thrown  beyond  the  pearly  gates,  there's  little  reason  to  keep   playing  that  rusty  old  harp  so  you'll  break  a  few  laws  on  the  way  down hoping no one Really Big will take notice .  The first thing you must do is change your identity . There's a few ways to go about it. The simplest way is to steal someone else's. Someone who won't care. Someone who, frankly, isn't here anymore. A baby. Yep that's right, a baby whose gone up to the pearly gates but on the way up managed to drop that shiny new social security number when his wings popped out . Thousands of babies never make it past a year in this world of rain and failure. They pass on, greener pastures and all that, God Bless em, but the names  of  those  tykes  are  still  in  the  system.  Your  system.  The  same  one you've been paying your hard-earned money into for all your life. So you need  to  research  deceased  citizens  who  died  when  they  were  young, preferably around your age. This is the one time in all of human existence when Google is really your friend .  You get the number and that's the number you'll use for a new driver's license, passport, bank account or even credit union. Combine that with and off-shore holding corp and you may have a winning combination .  It  may  be  that  the  deceased  is  in  fact  listed  in  the  Social  Security Administration's  system  as  'deceased'.  Not  always,  but  sometimes.  Your mission  is  to  keep  trying  until  you  get  one  that  isn't  in  this  beast  of  a system.  Getting  a  'new'  number  isn't  easy.  The  brigands  that  run  that maniacal  ship  often  require  an  in-person  interview  before  they  give  it. Again, not always, and it'd be quite embarrassing to explain how you got by the last 30 years without one or a driver's license .  But if the illegals can do it, so can you IF you've got nothing to lose. Nothing  is  set  in  stone  where  the  government  is  concerned  and  for  the record they catch more rule-followers than rule-breakers .  That said, read again the disclaimer at the top of this chapter. Sneaking into  Canada   even  if  you're  Canadian  citizen   without  stopping  into  the checkpoint is also a felony, one that's punishable by a $5000 dollar fine .   SNIFFER DOGS & CASH  W hen going through customs checkpoints, keep in mind that there are dogs that are trained to sniff out money. Some dogs are gifted that way. Some of them can even sniff out cancer. People not living near the border think these dogs are out all the damn time. It isn't true. I live in Canada and can tell you I've seen a dog twice, both times on sunny bright flower days and happy as a clam. But on a rainy day? Here's a little police secret: cops hate working in the rain just as much as sniffer dogs .  State troopers in particular would rather sit in their police cruiser and wait till the rain stops on the interstate from say, New Orleans to Phoenix, to resume ticket writing or searches. That's why if you're a smuggler or just a guy who likes to bring a little reefer along on a long beach trip, you leave on a rainy day. Same with customs. On some days, the rain and snow fly in sideways . Can you picture a cop  any kind  enjoying writing out a stack of tickets that way? I can’t . Back to sniffer dogs . Snoopy  can  separate  scents  so  hiding  cash  or  drugs  in  mustard  isn't going to work. His big wet nose can smell weed even under your nails to say nothing about clothes. Most of these dogs though are trained to sniff out the serious drugs, drugs like heroin, MDMA, cocaine and every other drug imaginable.  And  cash.  Oh  yes.  Cash  has  quite  a  strong  scent.  Take  out  a couple grand from your bank account and when you get it home, take a long whiff of it. It's potent stuff and I read one account that said there's traces of cocaine on every $100 dollar bill in the US .  A  sealed  ziploc  bag  will  get  you  through  50%  of  the  time  though, provided the bag is washed thoroughly and any residue on the outside has   been rinsed away. The problem here is that weed, like cash, gives off a very potent  odor  and  given  enough  time  the  scent  will  permeate  through  the plastic. So you must do this within hours of travel. The longer it's in there the more risky it gets that the smell has permeated through the seal to reach the dog's wet nose .  One thing to remember though : It’s that the primary function of a sniffer dog is to act as a legal prop,  regardless of what you're carrying. Yes, a legal prop .  Let's say you get profiled . You're  a  twenty-something,  college  aged,  black-skinned,  black-haired tattooed-up  probable  drug  user.  You  get  pulled  over  on  some  pretense  to secondary  inspection  coming  into  Canada.  You  refuse  consent  to  any search. The cop brings a drug dog and that dog ALERTS  according to the cop   like  you've  got  Cheech  and  Chong  hidden  in  the  trunk  with  100 pounds of coke. Now the cop has a probable cause for a warrantless search . "The dog barked so he must be a terrorist!"  though they don't generally  alert by barking  .  Regardless, it's almost always the officer who targets you in 95% of the cases  and  it  almost  never  matters  whether  the  dog  can  smell  anything  or not, just that the dog was present and the cop "testifies" that it alerted. This is true with cash, drugs or the preggo alien in the back seat from Men in Black. Doesn't matter what it is .  Also,  you  don't  legally  have  to  wait  for  them  to  bring  the  drug  dog because  doing  so  would  constitute  a  detainment  -  which  they  cannot  do unless they are arresting you on specific grounds. If they threaten you with it you should ask if you're being detained. When they inevitably say "no," that's your cue to leave. Just make sure that any other issues  like a speeding ticket  are already taken care of so that the cop doesn't go back to his her car and just sit on your driver's license until the dog shows up .  Sailboats  S ailboats can be an effective way to disappear, with a few caveats. Do you hold a US passport? If you do then why do you need someone's permission to leave the coast? Hire a skipper you trust  and a first mate!  if you can't   sail and just need to get from point A to point B. Blue water boats you can buy on the cheap  relatively speaking  for about 20 grand. You'd want to go someplace with a less than reliable immigration control system, obviously. A place without an extradition treaty with the U.S .  Laos ? It's your port of call but sailing around southwest Asia is about as low- key as a guy can get without kicking off a new career as a Tibetan monk. The downside is that you can get a little too comfortable in other places like the  Mediterranean  and  end  up  exposing  your  new  identity  to  first  world officials  and  their  beast  systems.  You  don't  want  to  end  up  in  someplace that's quickly turning into a shadow of the USA .  Are you broke ? Don't sweat it. It's mostly a mental barrier which, if you get to a safe harbor somewhere abroad, you'll see it never was a barrier at all. If you lack cold  hard  cash  and  need  to  flee  with  little  in  the  way  of  records  being assigned to your hot name, lots of boats lack enough crewmen to do the job. They've got their own safety to worry about. If they not enough men, they don't sail. They'll take you in if you ask with a smile .  'Hop aboard!' they'll say after you've promised to pay for the cheap beer. You  can  forget  about  getting  paid  like  the  rest,  though  they'll  probably throw you some scraps. That's good enough. The real hurdle is to hop on a boat that won't create a paper trail  as in no centralized system . Somewhere that doesn't assign you a number to track you to your dying breath. A place like  Cambodia  now  that  I  think  about  it.  If  you've  ever  seen  Cambodian border checkpoints then you know how lax they can be .  Either  way,  be  sure  to  record  your  adventure  on  camera:  Boarding  a  ship, working as a crew member, adventure unknown .   CONCLUSION  "Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the  light!" - Dylan Thomas  C ongratulations! You now have the expertise to stay cloaked, go dark and tell the NSA to get stuffed on her best day .  But that's not all. You now possess a kind of clairvoyance - that sixth sense we call a gut-check and an enhanced one at that. Whereas before it was  little  more  than  a  rusty  sword,  it  is  now  a  double-bladed  lightsaber. You'll spot others looking to fill tyranny's place when they come calling and call they will because neither power nor corruption ever tolerate a vacuum. You'll  spot  those  taffers  a  mile  away   truth  be  told,  you  probably  could before, but now by god you can do something about it .

DARKNET  H ow to Stay Anonymous Online  A Beginner’s Guide   INTRODUCTION  "I f you want total security, go to prison. There you're fed, clothed, given medical  care  and  so  on.  The  only  thing  lacking  ...  is  freedom"  -  Dwight Eisenhower  F riend ,  My  name  is  Lance  and  I  am  the  author  of  this  book  on  encryption security  and  anonymity.  I  have  been  an  encryption  enthusiast  as  well  as writing about security in general for over a decade. I have been a member of  many  security  and  encryption  forums  since  the  1980s,  and  have  been involved  with  computer  technology  long  before  that   yeah  I  know  that makes me an old geezer . But if there is a security or encryption program out there, I have used it and experienced its strengths and its shortcomings and  more than likely  attracted the attention of the authorities  more on that later  .  I was there when PGP first arrived on the scene and when Napster was the  dominant  method  of  p2p  trading.  I  have  used  most  versions  of  PGP, Drivecrypt,  Bestcrypt,  Truecrypt,  Tor,  Freenet,  I2P  and  every  spinoff  and copycat you can think of .  Let's  face  it.  Today  we  are  constantly  bombarded  with  news  by  the media  of  those  trawled,  raided,  arrested,  imprisoned,  tortured  and humiliated because they weren’t necessarily breaking any law but because they did not know the difference between privacy and anonymity. I waited   and  waited  for  some  smart  hacker  to  put  something  up  on  Amazon  to prevent this from happening .  Didn't happen . So I decided it would be me. I stepped up to the plate pronto, though truth be told I had been meaning to put together some of the rudimentary elements  of  encryption  security  in  such  a  way  that  a  person  without  any knowledge of security encryption or anonymity could become familiar .  It is not a particularly advanced book, but rather a portal from which a beginner  can  step  through  with  the  assurance  of  anonymity  when  he  is online. To that end I present a few tools  mostly free  at your disposal to accomplish this lofty goal. If you’re an advanced user, you just might learn some hidden vulnerabilities in your favorite anonymity program .  A PhD in computer science is not required to use encryption. Neither are you required to be a programmer of any sort. You only have to know your way around your operating system and be able to follow directions to the letter. If you know how to install an operating system, or for that matter, any  application  at  all,  then  you  can  safely  use  encryption  programs  to preserve your own digital data and safety .   PRIVACY AND ANONYMITY  I f you’re like one of the many billions of people on the planet who use the internet to surf the net, check email, download programs or do any kind of online work, then you probably know there are risks associated with being a habitual internet user. That's just how it is. But it is not your fault that there are so many latent traps and pitfalls associated with online spelunking, in whatever form that may be .  It is just a fact of life that the Good lives alongside the Evil in our lives, offline or online. This book is meant as a beginner’s guide to distinguish between the Good and the Evil, and to conceal your online footprint. To be a ghost on the internet, that is our aim .  This book is not necessarily for the advanced, such as those who teach computer science courses, but rather it is for those who would like to learn to  surf  without  compromising  their  identity,  or  having  their  online  habits tracked  24 7,  and  who  engage  in  some  risky  speech  against  their government once in a blue moon. It is also for those who might not know about some of the little known vulnerabilities in their favorite “anonymous” software programs. In the end, you just might learn there is a vast difference between “anonymity” and “privacy ”.  Let’s start with the basics. I’ll just put this out there so you know the weight of the privacy situation entirely. As of 2014, you are always being tracked  on  the  internet  in  just  about  every  way  you  can  imagine.  Search engines,  cookie  managers,  download  managers  and  everything  you  do online  has  the  potential  to  make  someone,  somewhere,  a  LOT  of  money. Most  of  the  time,  this  is  because  laser-targeted  advertising  is  extremely   profitable.  The  more  they  know  about  your  habits,  the  more  money  they make .  How ? Simple. If they know more about your fears, your likes and dislikes, and how and where you spend your money, they can deliver targeted advertising to you. Laser targeted advertising. That means more power for them, less for you. Now, advertising in and of itself is not such a bad thing, but neither is  a  loaded  gun  sitting  on  top  of  the  fridge.  By  itself  it  can  do  nothing. However it is the method of execution that defines its usefulness .  If you type any medical search term into a major search engine such as Google, Yahoo, or Bing, soon enough you’ll start to see targeted ads. If you search  for  “how  to  cure  a  hangover”,  you  might  not  see  anything  right away, since hangovers generally don’t last that long. However if you were to  type  “how  to  cure  herpes”,  you  will  likely  be  typing  variations  of  that sentence over the course of a few weeks or months since it is not an easy condition  to  treat.  Eventually  you  would  see  pay-per-click  ads  start  to manifest themselves in your search engine results in the top corners. These ads might be selling all manner of snake-oil remedies for the cure to herpes, or they might be referrals to medical specialists .  The bottom line is this: why do they think you have this disease? The answer is because you repeatedly typed it into the search engine over the course of days months. Over the course of a year, how much do you reveal about your medical history and identity to your favorite search engine? Do you ever wish you could keep this information private ?  They like to “bubble” your identity based on how you search: the time between searches, the time of day, your country, your area. With the help of a very specific item in your internet portfolio called an IP address, they can even find out where you live, who your ISP is, and chart a course right to your very doorstep. With the help of Google Maps, and a whole plethora of other mapping applications, this can potentially lead to some very annoying and or  embarrassing  situations.  Do  you  think  this  information  would  be valuable  to  door-to-door  salesmen?  Or  perhaps  a  company  that  sends  out mailed advertisements? Of course .  But  first  things  first,  let’s  briefly  say  a  word  about  the  difference between  privacy  and  anonymity  since  many  would-be  geeks  confuse  the two. They are not the same thing. Not by a long shot .   Anonymity & Privacy - The Differences  W  HILE  WE  SHOULDN’T  WASTE  time  splitting  hairs  here,  it  is probably  a  good  idea  to  distinguish  between  the  terms  “privacy”  and “anonymity”. The two terms are not really as interchangeable as you think. Let’s say that you have Firefox running, and you are working from home with a direct connection to your ISP. You don’t want anyone knowing what you’re doing, so you select the “private mode” tab in Firefox. This disables cookies  and  inhibits  the  ability  to  store  any  remembered  websites   unless you choose to do so  .  However this privacy only goes so far. It does nothing for the IP address problem  we  discussed  earlier.  Search  engines  still  see  it,  as  does  your internet service provider. Both entities know which sites you visit and for how long, based on your IP address. In short, they can see everything. Your wife can’t, however. That is why the privacy mode in web browsers were built: to keep the sites you visit private and out of the public view .  Is this privacy enough for your needs? You certainly have some level of privacy,  but  anonymity  is  another  matter.  Anonymity  takes  privacy  to  an entirely  different  level,  where  the  IP  address,  and  thus  anything  you  do online,  is  extinguished  like  a  wet  cloth  to  a  candle’s  flame  through  layer after  layer  of  digital  barriers.  If  you  want  to  have  privacy,  use  Firefox’s private  mode,  or  use  a  VPN  service  provider  in  conjunction  with  this feature  to  ensure  no  one  else  in  your  household  can  see  your  online footprints. This assumes that they do not have access to your laptop or PC .  If that's the case, it's game over . If  on  the  other  hand  you  want  anonymity,  there  are  several  tools  are your disposal, one of which is to use the Tor network. In doing so, you will guarantee  yourself  strict  anonymity  and  be  assured  of  simple  privacy  as well, provided you don't do something stupid like blurt out enough info  on a forum, for instance  that narrows you down to a city or state .   THE ANONYMOUS TOR NETWORK  "I f money is your hope for independence you will never have it. The only real security that a man will have in this world is a reserve of knowledge, experience, and ability ."  Henry Ford  E very Internet Service Provider assigns  an  IP  address  to  every  user  who logs  into  their  network.  From  there,  you  can  connect  to  the  millions  of websites,  newsgroups,  and  online  applications  that  you  enjoy  most.  IP addresses  are  like  phone  numbers.  They  tell  your  computer  where  to connect and send packets of data. They need this information to not only send data, such as html code, but also flash code so you can watch Youtube videos. These are targeted with ads, too. And if you bring up task manager in Windows, you can see Flash player running. Do you think Adobe is not sending data back to them about your habits? Let's continue .  So, if the security of online privacy involves concealing the IP address between  two  computers,  how  do  those  two  computers  talk  to  each  other without  a  direct  connection?  If  you  hide  the  phone  number,  how  do  you make  the  call?  The  answer  is  simple:  you  have  someone  else  in  another country dial the number for you. This is the first step to being anonymous online.  Do  not  use  the  IP  address   yours   as  a  direct  connection.  Hire  a middle  man  to  do  the  talking  for  you.  How  is  this  possible?  There  are several ways. You can use the free online program called Tor , which acts a relay  point  between  you  and  your  online  destination.  There  are  also  paid   services called VPNs  virtual private networks  as well as other anonymous networks like Freenet and I2P, but we’ll get into the specifics of those later .  First and foremost, let’s talk about Tor . It is the quintessential solution to online privacy since it masks your IP address. The websites you connect to have no way of knowing where you live, which ISP you are using, or what your browsing habits are. When you connect to the Tor network, you are establishing a conduit whereby if you connect  to  a  website   Google  for  instance ,  it  connects  through  several layers of IP addresses, or “onion layers” to reach its destination. You send out a message, email, or some type of communication. The message then goes to Bob, Jane and Herb, then finally reaches the end of the line…your favorite  webpage.  It  routes  data   backwards forwards   through  an  onion later  of  IP  addresses,  so  that  no  one  adversary  can  see  who  sent  what without very significant resources .  As you have probably guessed, there is a small speed hit in doing this. In order to hide your IP address, several “hops” or intermediaries, have to be  jumped  through.  Like  portals.  Without  going  into  too  much  technical detail, let’s just say that these hops serve a very valuable purpose: to keep your private communications out of the hands of those that intend to snoop on  you.  Since  your  IP  address  changes  every  time  you  login  to  the  Tor network,  they  can’t  “bubble”  you  effectively  and  target  you  with  ads because  you  look  like  a  different  person  from  a  foreign  country  to  them each  time  you  login.  The  Tor  relay  will  end  up  giving  you  a  different country  to  “pop-out”  from  with  each  session  of  your  Tor  browser,  thus making it impossible to know your origin or where you will go next .  Let’s  examine  an  analogy  between  Tor  and  regular  internet  usage. You’re  sitting  in  your  living  room  browsing  anonymously  via  the  Tor network.  Your  wife  on  the  other  hand  is  sitting  in  the  kitchen  on  her Macbook, browsing without Tor. You might wonder if her browsing habits break  your  own  anonymity.  They  don’t…up  to  a  point.  While  your  isp doesn’t know what *you* are doing online, they certainly do in regards to your wife .  Imagine yourself driving down Main Street in a Mercedes with tinted windows. No one can peer inside to see what you are doing at the stoplight. Not  even  the  cops.  Your  wife  on  the  other  hand  has  non-tinted  windows. People  can  glance  over  without  any  effort  and  tell  if  she  is  smoking  a cigarette, listening to her iPod or talking on her phone. You are anonymous.   She is not. The ISP along with any websites she visits can see everything she does online. They can’t see what you are doing, however .  Firefox   and  many  other  browsers   talk  to  different  hosts,  with  the  router acting as the traffic cop. An example :  Y our machine: Port X, Machine A  Tor: all encrypted traffic    Your wife: Port Y, Machine B  without Tor: all visible traffic    I t's like shooting fish in a barrel, and for the NSA, even easier than that. This  same  concept  also  applies  with  other  things  you  may  do  on  your machine while using Tor. If you use BitTorrent, your ISP can still see what you do on the P2P network even if you are running Tor simultaneously. But it cannot see the contents of the Tor network .  Thus, don’t do anything on your P2P network that you wouldn’t want your ISP to know about. Tor however is a different story since they cannot see what is going on between Tor relays. For all intents and purposes, Tor is like a cloak of invisibility that shields you from the sight of all onlookers, unless  you  have  accidentally  ripped  a  hole  in  the  cloak   i.e.  turned  on javascript .  If  you  are  thinking,  "Wow,  it  might  be  cool  to  run  BitTorrent through Tor so I won't get sued". A nice goal, except BitTorrent devs aren't falling  over  themselves  to  implement  this  feature  with  Tor,  and  the  Tor network  can't  really  handle  the  bandwidth  anyway.  You'll  just  make everyone else miserable by downloading those 720p Blu-Ray rips you can easily get from Usenet  and with SSL, you're not likely to get sued .   It might be prudent to spell out some of the best practices of using the Tor  network  should  you  decide  to  use  it.  First,  although  the  Tor  package comes with a preconfigured Firefox browser, there are still some rules you should follow that might not be apparent .  Never give any compromising information on the Tor network that could be used to identify you. This means using your credit card for purchases, accessing your bank account, or logging into a social media site like Facebook. Card transaction are traceable.   Tor, in fact, may even result in flagging transactions done via a tor exit node . Never mix browsers. Don’t use the same browser you browse every day to Facebook and your ISP email as you do to access the Tor network. Super cookies can give away which sites you visit outside of Tor and can lead to a correlation attack on your identity IP address . Always disable Javascript. The reason for this is that exploits can be utilized to reveal your IP address through using flash. Flash videos such as those on Youtube only work if this is enabled. After installation of Tor, ensure that the settings in the NoScript plugin are ON and not off by default in the plugins options screen . Install a bare minimum of browser plugins. You want to be as vanilla as everyone else. Too many addins, plugins, games, etc., can act as an identity beacon--fonts you use, time of day you use certain features, can all be used to build a profile on you. BE VANILLA . Disable any automatic updates in the browser’s options tab. This also includes updates for any addons. You should update manually, not automatically .   TOR AND TORRENTS  A word about torrents and the Tor network. It might seem on the surface that  running  your  torrent  client  through  the  Tor  network  would  be  an obviously  beneficial  idea.  After  all,  if  Tor  can  cloak  your  regular  Firefox downloads, surely it can do the same with torrents too, right? Well, yes and no. Yes, you could route your traffic through Tor using your favorite torrent client, however this is not a good idea for several reasons .  The  first  is  that  Tor  was  never  developed  to  withstand  the  kind  of  punishing traffic bandwidth that usually comes from torrenting .  Secondly, most torrent clients like uTorrent, BitSpirit, and libTorrent are not coded properly to make you anonymous on the Tor network. They often will  ignore  their  socks  proxy  settings  since  UDP  protocol  is  heavily involved with torrenting, and will send your real IP address to the tracker, thereby defeating the purpose of using Tor completely. Tor in fact still does what it is coded to do: send whatever packets anonymously through the Tor network to your destination. However, it sends your IP address within the torrent tracker right along with it…anonymously .  It would be like sending a secret message in an envelope directly to the person you are attempting to hide that message from. This is not a problem with the Tor application, but rather the way torrent trackers are coded. The only fix would be if the torrent application coders themselves rewrote their applications  to  work  harmoniously  with  the  Tor  network,  something  they probably will not get around to doing anytime soon  and much to the glee of Tor developers  .   Tor Onion Sites  O NE OF THE most secretive elements of the Tor network is the existence of  Tor  Onion  websites,  which  are  pseudo  top  level  domains  acting  as anonymous hidden services. In other words, they are hidden in that they can only  be  accessed  by  the  Tor  users  themselves  residing  within  the  Tor network,  rather  from  the  open  web.  The  motive  for  the  creation  of  such hidden sites is so that the admin of the site as well as those accessing such sites cannot be traced. Since onion sites that are based on the hidden service protocol  cannot  be  accessed  from  the  regular  internet,  the  address  of  the onion site you are looking for must be known. You can connect to an onion website on Tor just as you can a regular website, by typing the address into the address bar. For example, you might want to go to Tor2Web, in which case the address is :  http:  tor2web.org   A warning about tor2web: it is intended to offer one-sided security, that is,  to  protect  the  identity  of  those  publishing  content  on  Tor,  not  those browsing it. If you want to be secure while browsing you’ll need to install the Tor application. Convenience and speed should always take a back seat where security is concerned .  Needless to say, a hidden network would not stay completely benign of nefarious  webmasters  if  it  wasn’t  indeed  anonymous.  To  that  end,  the Hidden Wiki was developed, a singular .onion page with a wikipedia-like structure  outlining  in  explicit  detail  everything  from  political  activists  to every conceivable criminal group imaginable. There are links to hundreds of various .onion sites dealing with everything from how to obtain illegal drugs, warez operations, virus creation, anonymous use of Bitcoins, illegal pornography, hacked Paypal accounts and even how to hire contract killers. Needless to say, some of these sites need to be taken with a grain of salt .  Be  aware  of  your  own  country’s  laws  regarding  what  can  legally  be obtained.  What  goes  around  in  Amsterdam  or  Japan  may  not  fly  straight with the authorities in the USA. Remember that information that exists in Deep  Web  is  just  that:  information.  By  itself,  the  information  can  do nothing. Words are just rearranged letters to get your point across. Pictures and videos are simply ones and zeros moving across your display. It is what they are eventually used for that define their ethics .   At  the  core  of  it,  the  Hidden  Wiki  is  not  terribly  dissimilar  from  any run-of-the-mill  black  market  operation  offline.  It  just  so  happens  to  be online,  and  accessible  by  anyone  with  a  little  search  engine  sleuthing capability. Not all of the information in the Deep Web is used for nefarious purposes. Like Freenet, there are a lot of different sites that concentrate on exposing human rights abuse, political corruption, and government scandals involving high-level politicians. In the end, it is what you do with the data that determines the criminal element .  Testing your IP address visibility on Tor  W HEN  YOU  HAVE  INSTALLED  TOR,  you  may  want  to  test  your  IP address to see if it really is broadcasting your Tor IP and not your real IP address. If you installed the default package of Tor, then Tor will show you the  IP  you  are  broadcasting  as  your  start  page.  If  you  want  to  check  it yourself, then go to  http:  whatismyipaddress.com   . This will show you not only your IP address, but your internet service provider as well, and where it is located on google maps. It will also show city  and  country.  When  you  are  using  Tor,  you  will  see  a  different city country than the one you currently reside in. Mark down what your IP address is outside of Tor, and check this site when your launch Tor if you're especially paranoid  I am  .   VPNS  T he last few years have seen an emergence of many different VPN  virtual private  network   providers  with  server  farms  in  just  about  every  country. What  a  VPN  does  is  somewhat  similar  to  what  the  Tor  network  does.  It sends a different IP address to your destination, whether that is a webpage, usenet provider, or webhost. There are some pros and cons to this. First, it is not  free.  A  VPN  will  cost  the  same  amount  you  would  get  for  Usenet service: about ten dollars per month. This amount fluctuates from provider to  provider.  Sometimes  it  is  a  little  more,  sometimes  a  bit  less,  but  all providers have you login to their service the same way you would an ISP. Most  of  the  configuration  is  automatic  and  doesn’t  require  any  technical wizardry to setup. Five minutes, give or take .  Another major difference is that while Tor provides anonymity, and is free, a VPN will provide you with privacy , but not necessarily anonymity . This is because the middle man, the VPN in this case, knows your real IP address.  They  have  to  know  this  information  in  order  to  forward  your requests. The VPN service is built upon a different technology than Tor. It is built for speed and stability . Torrenting, you say? Knock yourself out .  Further, let’s say that you’re a Chinese dissident. You don’t like the way your  country  is  headed  in  regards  to  free  speech  and  human  rights.  You can’t  exactly  criticize  the  Chinese  government  in  the  Saturday  paper  can you? Of course not. So what is a good, law-abiding dissident to do? You build a news website using a VPN in another country and relay your dissent through that internet portal. You don’t necessarily have to build a website. You  could  simply  setup  your  newsreader  to  access  Usenet  via  the  VPN connection. In that way, the Chinese government could not determine the   origin of any anti-governmental messages through the use of the IP address  unless  of  course  you  hint  of  incriminating  personal  information  that narrows down your location  .  You can also access forbidden places by the Chinese government, such as Facebook, Skype, private chat rooms and even Usenet. The reason these kinds  of  places  are  blocked  by  the  Great  Firewall  of  China  is  precisely because they are fertile ground for free speech enthusiasts. While this may sound  like  an  easy  way  to  circumvent  the  Chinese  police,  remember  that most  VPN  providers  offer  connections  through  almost  every  civilized country you can think of. If you are a Chinese dissident, I wouldn’t connect to a VPN located in China, but rather Canada or perhaps a country hostile to China.  Most  VPN  providers  offer  a  selection  of  many  servers  to  choose from in which to route your messages and traffic .  On that note, let’s talk a bit about law enforcement and VPNs. Many in the past have erroneously thought that a VPN carried with it a strong dose of anonymity, similar to what Tor offered. It doesn’t quite stack up that way. A  VPN  service  offers  privacy,  not  anonymity,  as  we  stated.  They  do  not route  your  data  through  intermediaries  the  way  Tor  does.  Depending  on which VPN you choose, you could end up with one in Switzerland who will not cave to anyone’s request for subscriber information outside of Sweden. On the other hand, you might have a US based provider who will bow down to the whims of any judge’s warrant for subscriber information in a New York minute .  While most are perfectly safe for purposes of torrents and the like, one should think twice about using a VPN in a western country for felonious offenses,  as  they  will  most  likely  give  your  name  and  address  up  to  law enforcement  in  order  to  stave  off  any  fines  and or  trouble  by  the government. There are of course ways around this, such as not using your credit card and paying anonymously, however sometimes it is better not to use  a  VPN  at  all  for  those  kinds  of  purposes   think  hackers,  smuggling, illicit banned goods, drugs etc . Vpns have never been built with anonymity in mind. Tread carefully .   TOR RELAYS  "W ho can you trust? Nobody, cause nobody wants you here ."  T  hose  words,  uttered  by  Sean  Connery  in  The  Untouchables,  are  as appropriate  for  darknet  discussions  as  they  are  for  the  mob.  But  let's  be realistic  for  a  moment.  There  are,  as  you  read  this,  ten  thousand  more organized crime syndicates spread out over the net than you will ever come across  in  the  "Deep  Web".  They  run  the  same  secure,  enterprise-grade software  that  Wall  Street  banks  use  and  cloak  themselves  better  than Ringwraiths. No outside eyes peer in unless the alphabet agency has a guy on the inside. Cartels like these rake in millions in drugs, arms, counterfeit pharmaceuticals, mercs and excel at human trafficking .  The  Deep  Web  is  similar,  but  not  that  similar.  But  those  who  are  for outlawing it completely are really advocating for more control rather than for less crime, as was the case with Prohibition. They claim the negatives outweigh the positives. Let's say a guy in North Korea gets curious as to why his government is censoring information from him. He wants to know why. So he uses Tor to access websites blocked by the North Korean regime  Facebook for instance, to hook up with an uncle who may have escaped to S. Korea . And he does so anonymously. So that is one positive trait .  But this, they say, does not outweigh the child porn, contract killers and heroin  runners.  They  say,  people  aren't  going  to  Tor  to  discuss  ways  of avoiding the mine fields on the border and neither are they discussing the latest  enlightenment  from  Tibet.  Yes,  anonymity  has  its  meritorious   moments,  but  someone  who  wants  to  hide  almost  always  does  so  at  the circumvention of the law. There are only so many North Koreans, after all . They assume, quite wrongly, that those criminals engaged in the above activities would cease to exist. They are wrong. These were around before Tor and the Deep Web were even a spark in the developer's minds, and will thrive regardless of what government regulations are cooked up by congress critters. The same as it was during Prohibition .  Hazards of running a Tor Exit Node  I n 2012, an Austrian named William Weber, an IT admin, was arrested for running Tor servers that route anonymous traffic over the Tor network. The charge? Distributing illegal images. Police detected the data coming off one of the nodes he ran. A police raid ensued. Searched his home. Confiscated his  Xbox,  iPods,  all  drives  and  miscellaneous  electronics  and  even  his legally owned firearms. The court order revealed one of the Tor exit nodes  he ran seven  was transporting the data .  Notice,  we  did  not  state  that  he  transported  the  data.  The  data  in question is going to come down on some node, be it his or someone else's. That is how Tor works: via encrypted traffic that gets piped through servers on its own IP address, through various layers  hence the term Onion layer  and decrypted back into its initial form. An ISP cannot discern the contents in transit. However, law enforcement can see the contents coming out of a node  that  was  sent  from  the  other  side  of  the  globe.  Holding  a  Tor  node operator  responsible  would  be  like  holding  a  forum  administrator responsible because some anonymous poster said he was going to kill the president .  Misuse of Tor end nodes are fairly common. Back in 2008, a man was arrested by German police after bomb threats passed through his Tor node, and  similarly,  they  confiscated  all  electronics--hardware,  software,  and threatened  imprisonment  because  someone  abused  his  generosity.  These kinds of cases bring up a few parallels. Should the Austrian government sue Google for having illegal data flowing through its servers? We're not only talking  about  images  or  bomb  threats.  Warez,  kidnapping,  extortion, bribery, espionage, a long laundry list of crimes occur on a daily basis via   their  search  engine,  and  though  Google  cooperates  with  law  enforcement  as  Weber  did ,  when  was  the  last  time  you  heard  Google's  servers confiscated by a court order ?  And  then  there  is  encryption.  Should  Drivecrypt  and  Truecrypt developers  be  held  liable  for  helping  illegal  enterprises?  Truecrypt  is  a software used quite heavily by Mexican cartels as well as organized crime in the United States. Law enforcement, particularly the FBI, tends to shoot first and ask questions later. Maybe. If they're in a good mood  or ordered to by  a  judge .  Meanwhile,  your  electronics  are  confiscated  and  your reputation damaged .  The entire ordeal has been setting dangerous precedent for years, as any average Joe who just happens to pass some part of an illegal data packet through  his  connection   or  unsecured  WiFi   can  be  prosecuted. Furthermore, police are not known for their technical aptitude, in Austria or anywhere else. They took his Xbox360 and anything else plugged in that looked about as complex as a toaster. We mustn't allow Tor node operators to be scapegoats. If Tor dies, innocent people die. They won't get the word out about corrupt government actions without risking their own lives. And they shouldn't have to risk anything to get the word out .  As of 2014, no one has been sued or prosecuted in a U.S. court of law for running a Tor relay  unlike those using BitTorrent . Furthermore, using Tor as well as running a Tor relay is perfectly legal under U.S. law .  Benefits of Running a Tor Exit Node  W e've talked a little about the risks of being a Tor exit mode. You might be saying, well, the risks far outweigh the benefits. And in some places, you're right.  But  it  depends  on  where  you  live,  the  laws,  the  bandwidth,  your setup, etc .  So what are the benefits ? -  Help  people  all  over  the  world  browse  the  net  anonymously   esp.  censorship-prone countries    - Provide support for the network - Exit nodes are always scarce. Your generosity supports development . - Defeat tyranny  what's that? Well, North Korea for one     - Prevent websites search engines from tracking you - Help others get beyond the Great Firewall of China - Join the Rebel Alliance  yeah right   At this point it might be prudent to relay my own experience. The first time  I  used  Tor,  I  was  already  fairly  good  as  not  only  admin  of  several websites and hosted machines, but quite good at encryption. My frame of thought was, if I was no slouch at encryption, Tor would be a piece of cake. And it was...for a while. I had plenty of bandwidth available, so I jumped right in .  Being in North America at the time, it would be a few weeks to get up to speed on all the pros and cons of Tor relays, and not from the technical standpoint, but the legal. I envisioned Blackhawk helicopters and car chases involving white vans with license plates that read "NOTOJ" should I be so unlucky to screw up my configuration. Putting my paranoia aside, I finally got it running full speed, and studied the network logs like a hawk to see what it was doing. And I was well-pleased. Full of pride, you might say .  Tor traffic trickled in like a sprinkle before a storm, and after three days my node had spread just as the bandwidth limits I had preset kicked in. The feeling was euphoric. Addicting. I envisioned some tech-starved villager in North  Korea  accessing  something  verboten  by  the  Korean  government.  I kept thinking about Matthew Broderick in WarGames and the famous line, "The only way to win the game, was not to play." Well, I tweaked it to add, "...by the Man's rules." It was all good .  Until a week later when my ISP ordered me to cut the Tor umbilical. It was polite, but stern. It seemed a few complaints sailed their way. As my luck would have it, that North Korean villager turned out to be a swarm of torrentors  using  Tor  to  evade  the  trackers  setup  by  the  record  industry.  It hampered Tor's bandwidth like a hurricane had set upon it .  "Torrents?" I said. "Really ?" Yes indeed. And even though I lived in Canada at the time and wasn't worried about a torrent of lawsuits, I still did not want other Tor users to be hindered by greedy users. The problem I ran into was that filtering torrent traffic  is  a  bit  counterproductive  since  BitTorrent  is  able  to  run  on  any standard  port.  I  tried  blocking  ports  80  and  443   web  traffic .  It  wasn't  a silver  bullet,  however,  since  torrent  users  could  still  use  other  ports. BitTorrent clients like uTorrent and BitLord can run on any port, almost all randomly chosen. Thus every port you add to your exit node can connect to   another client listening on that same port. Some users even enable a range of  ports,  thereby  increasing  the  chance  of  getting  a  DMCA  takedown  for you .  Hence, we come to the Reduced Exit Policy of Tor, an alternative to the default exit policy. You are still able to connect and at the same time block TCP ports  usually  used by BitTorrent users. Below are a couple of port lists to check against BitTorrent clients :  h  List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers  ttps:  secure.wikimedia.org wikipedia en wiki   h ttp:  www.speedguide.net  ports.php  W hat should become clear as crystal at this point is that you should not run an  exit  relay  from  your  house,  with  emphasis  on  should  not  .  Why  not? Because of the aforementioned scenarios with law enforcement. As we've seen  in  prior  cases,  it  is  quite  easy  for  them  to  get  a  judge's  signature   a judge  who  knows  squat  about  Tor   on  a  no-knock  warrant  in  the  USA should  they  start  sniffing  your  traffic.  Not  only  will  they  take  your computer, but everything with connectivity, which these days includes TVs and monitors. Much better to run the exit relay from a commercial provider  and there are many . A few in the U.S. who are not only knowledgeable about  Tor,  but  have  the  support  needed  to  deal  with  abuse  cases  are  as follows :  A mazon Web Services  AWS    AmeriNOC Arvixe Axigy ChunkHost Team Cinipac   Cyberonic Ethr.net Evolucix Future Hosting  A  full  comprehensive  list  is  available  at  the  Tor  Wiki  that  covers  many countries,  each  with  their  own  subset  of  laws  dealing  with  anonymity services  and extensive comments on each  .  https:  trac.torproject.org projects tor wiki doc GoodBadISPs In the event you do decide to run a Tor relay from home however, make sure you inform your ISP and ascertain whether you have their full support  i.e. no surprises a month down the line . The abuse complaints will come sooner or later, just as they did for me. The Tor forums have a list of ISPs that are friendly towards Tor and are knowledgeable about the network, in addition to ones that are not .   FREENET  F  reenet  is  unlike  any  other  anonymizing  beast  on  the  entire  internet.  It takes quite a wizardly mind to crack its protection and to that, it is a bit like chess: easy to grasp the basics, long and difficult to become a master. Built in  2000,  Freenet  is  a  vast,  encrypted  datastore  spanning  thousands  of connected  computers  across  the  globe,  all  distributing  encrypted  contents from one computer to another. To this end, it is somewhat similar to a P2P program like Emule. Except with eEule, every file, whether it mp3, rar or iso is out there in the open for weeks, months and years, along with the IP addresses, trumpeting who downloaded and uploaded every file. You know what you upload, and what you download, and so does everyone else .  Freenet is different in this regard . While  your  IP  address  is  visible,  what  you  are  uploading  out  of  your datastore  is  not.  You  initially  setup  the  size  of  the  datastore  for  others  to download  from  you.  This  datastore  is  encrypted.  You  have  no  idea  what will  eventually  be  inside,  as  the  contents  are  encrypted.  It  is  a  bit  like  a postal worker delivering the mail. He has no idea what is in the package he is  delivering.  That  is  not  his  job.  His  job  is  to  deliver  the  contents  to  its destination. Therein is the strength of Freenet .  While  you  can  see  your  downloads  merrily  trickle  their  way  down  to your  laptop,  there  is  no  way  to  decrypt  your  datastore’s  content  and  see what it is you’re passing along to the nearest node. And to that, the bigger the datastore, the more efficiently Freenet runs. After one inserts a file into Freenet, the user is free to shutdown their pc. This is unlike torrents in that the stability of the torrent file is dependent on the length of online seeds.   Thus,  high  reliability  is  a  factor  with  Freenet  files,  as  the  file  is  spread between encrypted blocks residing in the Freenet system .  Freenet is slow. So slow in fact, that you may not see any measurable progress in download speed for a couple hours or so after install, and it may be a day before you can see extensive progress with old  unpopular  files. Don’t get discouraged because of this. It will speed up gradually over time . Now, with your IP address out there in the open, you might be tempted to think it is not very anonymous. Nothing could be further from the truth. Whatever you download is encrypted from one end of Freenet to the other, and decrypted on your PC. No one looking in from the outside can see who requested which file or message. No one on the inside knows either, except you. For this reason alone, it is extremely censorship-resistant. This level of anonymity requires each node that requests data to operate in “hops”, from many intermediaries, similar to what you would see in Tor .  However, no node knows who requested which file, thus giving a high level of anonymity. This requirement carries a price in that downloads as well as uploads are initially extremely slow, especially for new data inserts . Let’s say you want to share an iso dvd image on this network. You fire up Frost  a front-end addon for Freenet , then hit insert, then select the file. Then depending on how big your file is, you could be waiting for a long time, say several hours, for the file to finish. If this file had been inserted three  months  prior,  and  was  very  popular,  with  dozens  of  users  trying  to fetch said file, then that file would download very fast. However this is not usually  the  case  with  new  files  since  every  kernel  of  data  on  Freenet operates faster if and only if it is a popular file .  There  are  two  types  of  security  protocols  that  Freenet  offers:  Darknet and  Openet.  For  Openet,  you  connect  to  other  users,  called  “strangers”. There is nothing sinister about this, as this is what the Freenet developers envisioned that most beginners would use. The IP address of said strangers is visible, but the anonymity of Freenet isn’t nested in the security of the IP address  like  Tor,  but  rather  it  is  nested  in  the  encryption  methods  of  the distributed datastore .  The  other  security  option,  which  you  are  given  at  installation,  is Darknet, where you will connect to “friends” rather than “strangers”. These will be Freenet users that you will have  presumably  previously exchanged node references, which are public security keys. With Darknet mode, it is assumed that you will have a higher level of trust, as your node reference is   related to your online Freenet identity. Needless to say, this mode is not to be  taken  lightly.  You  really  do  have  to  TRUST  those  you  add  to  this protocol. That is, the darknet protocol .  Within  Freenet,  there  are  no  censors.  Every  kind  of  free  speech  is allowable  and  often  encouraged.  The  very  way  in  which  Freenet  is programmed makes it impossible to remove any message from the system by a censor. Individual users may opt to erase certain comments from the frost  system,  for  instance,  but  this  is  only  at  the  local  level,  on  their machine, and not the Freenet network itself. Thus, no religious group for instance  can  force  others  in  the  network  to  conform  to  their  belief  and discussion system. No one on Freenet may deem information so offensive that it must be removed. Not even Freenet developers .  Needless  to  say,  this  has  some  negative  consequences  in  that  anyone may  say  anything  to  anyone  at  any  time.  Some  Freesites  on  the  Freenet network  are  plagued  by  spammers,  identity  thieves,  terrorists,  molesters, government  anarchists  and  software  pirates.  The  Freenet  developers  have stated this is a necessary evil of sorts in allowing 100% free speech to reign free. It could be argued that one should not allow illicit digital goods to be exchanged between users just so people could speak freely, however one of the stated purposes of Freenet is to preserve such a system in the even of societal collapse or oppression .  While there are no rules to govern Freenet by in the sense of censoring unsightly  posts,  a  few  guidelines  have  been  posted  in  scattered  parts  of Freenet that should probably be heeded :  1  .     NEVER  GIVE  anyone  on  Freenet  your  node-reference,  as  this contains  information  that  could  be  exploited  to  correlate  your  Freenet identity with your IP address .  2.  Same rule as Usenet: Don’t give in to trolling activity. Trolling by its  very nature flourishes with the more responses it receives. Ignore them .  3.  Never give out any personal info: your location, where you grew up, which restaurants you like most, what kinds of clothing stores you shop at, as these could zero-in on your location  4.  Take notice of different regionally spelled words  labor vs. labour,  color vs. colour: these could reveal your home country  .   5.  Never use any nickname that is the very same unique nickname you use  for  opennet  forums.  Use  popular  nicknames  like  Shadow,  John,  Peter and the like .  T HE HIGHEST SECURITY setting can be a bit foreboding, but perhaps necessary  in  countries  where  criticizing  the  government  could  land  you  a lifetime  in  a  work  camp.  It  has  an  encrypted  password  option  to  encrypt Freenet  usage.  This  setting  is  in  the  security  configuration,  along  with  a host  of  other  options  of  varying  system  requirements.  The  higher  the security setting, the slower Freenet will run as it will use more resources to cover your footsteps .  When  first  installing  Freenet,  it  will  likely  take  no  more  than  a  few minutes, while asking you which security level you would like to operate at  normal up to maximum . After that and a bit of time allowed for Freenet to find nodes to connect to, you’ll be presented with a previously hidden world where  a  Freenet  index  lists  every  possible  combination  of  Freesites available. Everything from anarchy sites to Iranian news, to pirated copies of books, films and game roms and even a few political how to documents describing how to protest a corrupt government without getting caught will be indexed .  These  are  the  types  of  things  typically  either  censored  by  Google  in China, or deindexed altogether. The only thing missing is a disclaimer at the bottom of the screen welcoming you to the deepest, darkest depths of the internet, known as Darknet .  Optionally, you may run Freenet from an encrypted Truecrypt container file.  You  will  need  to  create  a  Truecrypt  volume  that  is  sufficiently  large enough  to  hold  whatever  files  you  intend  on  downloading  from  Freenet. Remember to keep in mind that when Freenet asks you how large you want the datastore to be, the size you choose could be a benefit to other Freenet users.  The  larger  the  datastore,  the  more  efficient  the  Freenet  network operates .  That  is  not  to  say  that  downloads  will  always  come  down  faster,  but rather encrypted data will last longer on the network. This is similar to the retention times that Usenet providers talk about when they try to sell their servers  to  you.  The  higher  the  data  retention,  the  longer  the  files  on  the network will last. There is also another bonus to having a large datastore,   say fifty gigabytes or so. Files that you may request may already be in your datastore  after  having  run  Freenet  for  some  time,  thereby  shortening  the time to retrieve them .  With  your  Truecrypt  container  you  can  run  Freenet  with  the  volume mounted and not worry about your Freenet activities being used against you in case of your computer being confiscated. You can also do the same for your  Tor  browser  as  well.  Install  Tor  browser  bundle  to  a  mounted Truecrypt container and only run the program when mounted .  Frost  F ROST IS a separate application than Freenet, which acts as a front-end. It makes browsing on the Freenet network more akin to browsing Usenet newsgroups. Download at :  H TTP:   JTCFROST.SOURCEFORGE.NET  A  FTER  RUNNING  FREENET,  you  can  optionally  run  Frost simultaneously  to  download  inserts  from  the  Freenet  network.  It  is  not mandatory  but  it  is  incredibly  helpful.  Run  Freenet,  then  Frost,  and  then wait  an  hour  or  so  for  Frost  to  find  some  groups,  and  then  hit  the  globe button  at  the  top  panel  to  subscribe  to  groups.  These  groups  all  have discussions going about every topic under the sun. Some of them are fairly dead, with almost no discussion at all, and others swarm with activity .  Frosty Tips  1.  If you started downloading something in Frost, finish it in Frost 2.   Like  Usenet,  don’t  troll  the  boards.  It  will  get  you  put  on  user’s “ignore” list and they will henceforth not see any messages from your nick .   3.  Never reveal your node reference to anyone on the Frost boards, as it  could be used to locate you .  4.  Set days to download backwards to 60  or however long you wish . Just be aware that it may take several days to retrieve all messages if you select a very large amount of days .  5.  In the options preferences tab, you may adjust the setting to ignore comments  from  users  with  less  than  four  messages  attached  to  their nickname. This is very effective at eliminating most spam messages on the board .   TRUECRYPT, VERACRYPT, ETC.  T here are two types of encryption: one that will prevent your sister from reading  your  diary  and  one  that  will  prevent  your  government.  -  Bruce Schneier  I  T  WOULD  BE  FOLLY  if  we  went  to  all  this  work  of  laying  out  the security options to keep our online footprint out of nefarious hands and not say  something  about  our  offline  footprint.  Put  simply,  you  should  tread carefully with your offline habits just as you should your online persona .  Let's  say  you’re  in  your  favorite  cafe.  You’re  sipping  your  ice cappuccino with your laptop in the corner of the coffee scented shop and have to make a break for the restroom. It’ll only take a minute or so, right? While you’re in there, the guy sitting at the next table decided to insert a USB key into your laptop and upload a keylogger virus into your machine. This  keylogger  is  ridiculously  small  in  size,  and  can  hide  undetected  by most users. It can even disguise itself as a windows service and look just like  any  other  svchost  process,  all  the  while  taking  snapshots  of  your screen, recording everything you typed for the remainder of that day, and emailing them to whomever installed the virus .  You would be a bit worried if you knew about it . However, most don’t realize they leave themselves vulnerable to such attacks in public places. Some experts have referred to this as the “evil maid attack”, after a scenario whereby you are in a hotel and briefly step outside for a moment and at which point the maid comes in and has physical access   to your running machine. They now have access to every cookie stored by your browser in addition to any credit card numbers you have used, possible phone numbers emails of friends, and the like. How to prevent this ?  For starters, to prevent identity theft you need to seriously consider full- disk  encryption.  This  is  not  nearly  as  complex  as  you  might  think.  It  is ridiculously  easy  encrypt  your  boot  drive  and  costs  you  nothing,  and potentially saves you from months of headache .  There are several encryption apps at your disposal: the paid programs, such  as  PGP,  Drivecrypt,  and  Phonecrypt,  and  the  popular  free  versions, PGP and Truecrypt. There are a few differences between them but the one thing  to  take  away  from  both  free  and  paid  versions  is  that  they  prohibit anyone from booting your computer, laptop, or phone without the password .  Truecrypt is free, and does this by creating a 256 AES encryption key. You install the application, select your drive you want to encrypt, and select your passphrase and create an encrypted key. Simple .  How does this benefit you? Well, the next time that thief who stole your laptop tries to boot up the hard drive, without the password he’ll be out of luck. He is presented with this password field before windows even boots, and  if  it  is  not  keyed  in  correctly,  the  drive  halts.  The  password,  if sufficiently long, is enough to withstand almost any brute-force attack, even by  the  NSA.  Just  make  sure  to  use  a  passphrase  that  will  be  easy  to remember, but long enough to thwart any attacker: 15-character passphrase with upper lowercase letters with a number or two .  Just how strong is Truecrypt? It is considered impossible to crack, on the  order  of  millions  of  years.  It  would  take  quantum  computers  eons  to crack even a moderately length passphrase using brute-force methods. In all likelihood the absolute weakest link is you .  Keyloggers can obtain your password if you are unlucky enough to get one. However, these are a fairly rare occurrence if you keep your operating system, anti-virus and anti-malware programs up to date. The other weakest link is your passphrase. You would be surprised at just how many people use their own personal information in their passphrases. Doing this might make the password easier to remember, but also easier to crack .  A  good  passphrase  is  made  up  of  lower  and  upper  case  characters  in addition to spaces, which lend more entropy bits to the protection. At each instance  a  bit  is  added  to  a  passphrase,  the  computational  crunching   requirement to crack such passphrase is doubled. If I were living in North Korea or China, for example, I would seriously consider a passphrase that was at least twenty characters long, with some keyboard symbols thrown in for good measure. Most people do not like to remember a twenty character passphrase however, so they use a less random one .  Drivecrypt is another encryption program, but it is not open-source and is  not  free.  I  have  used  this  program  for  eight  years  and  have  to  say  if money  is  a  concern,  then  go  with  Truecrypt  as  it  has  many  of  the  same functions that Truecrypt does, and for zero cost. Drivecrypt has an option called “bootauth” which is short for boot authorization. The install process is  similar  to  Truecrypt,  though  the  bootup  passphrase  screen  is  a  little different. You boot your hard drive, and then type in the passphrase to boot the OS. Truecrypt has this function as well .  As  stated,  it  is  not  open-source.  What  that  means  is  that  it  cannot  be studied  by  the  public  sector   read:  security  users   to  determine  if  any backdoors have been coded in. Like Truecrypt, it offers the option to create an encrypted operating system that holds a hidden operating system as well whose  existence  can  be  denied  to  those  trying  to  harm  or  prosecute  you. This  is  especially  beneficial  if  you  live  in  the  UK,  where  failure  to  hand over  a  passphrase  to  an  encrypted  hard  drive  can  get  you  two  years  in prison  on  a  contempt  of  court  charge.  However  you  could  give  them  the password to your decoy system. There is no way they could know if you were concealing a hidden operating system without a keylogger in place .  Truecrypt and Drivecrypt give no hints or leak any data regarding the existence of hidden files. The only way to mount said file is to know the password,  and  there  are  two  you  create  with  such  an  option:  one  for  the decoy, and one for the hidden container operating system .  Truecrypt  and  Drivecrypt  also  support  the  use  of  encrypted  container files,  which  when  clicked  will  mount  the  file  the  same  way  a  mounting application  like  DaemonTools  or  Nero  mounts  an  iso  image.  Prior  to mounting,  the  application  will  ask  you  for  the  password.  Mistype  the password and the container does not mount at all. This can be very handy as there  are  a  plethora  of  private  items  that  you  could  conceal  from government or any kind of prosecuting institution, such as medical records, tax records, school transcripts, business correspondence and the like .  Veracrypt  may  also  be  an  option  if  you  don’t  mind  the  Truecrypt  interface. In fact, they look and act very similar .   VeraCrypt main features :   Creates a virtual encrypted disk within a file and mounts it as a real  disk .  drive or hard drive .  authentication  .     Encrypts  an  entire  partition  or  storage  device  such  as  USB  flash    Encrypts a partition or drive where Windows is installed  pre-boot    Encryption is automatic , real-time  on-the-fly  and transparent .   Parallelization and pipelining allow data to be read and written as fast  as if the drive was not encrypted .    Encryption can be hardware-accelerated on modern processors .    Provides  plausible  deniability  ,  in  case  an  adversary  forces  you  to reveal  the  password:  Hidden  volume   steganography   and  hidden operating system .  S OME TIPS FOR TRUECRYPT VERACRYPT users :  1.   If  you  have  one,  disable  the  firewire  port,  as  this  can  be  used  to  reveal the encryption keys .  2.   Never  leave  any  containers  mounted  on  a  laptop  when  crossing  a border station, unless you want your private information in said container to be shared with the guards .  3.   Never  leave  your  PC  powered  on  and  unattended  for  any  lengthy amount of time  public wifi spots, cafes, libraries, college classrooms, etc . All  security  goes  out  the  window  when  an  attacker   or  anyone  else   has physical  access  to  your  machine.  Neither  Truecrypt  nor  Drivecrypt  can protect your data in such a case, as the attacker can install a keylogger that can record your keystrokes .  Thumbnails  I F YOU POSSESS any incriminating snapshots  flings, Wikileak photos, informant docs  then at a later time delete the images in the folder, be aware that a shadow copy still exists. In windows XP  yes, legions of users are still clinging to this OS , thumbnails of jpegs are stored within each folder   of the image’s location. So if you have a folder called “government office snapshots”, you will have thumbnails enabled in the folder settings tab for any  pictures   jpegs,  bitmaps,  etc ,  and  a  hidden  thumbs.db  file  will  be present that shows a mini version of the picture in question. So even if you delete the jpegs, this hidden file will still reveal to anyone what the contents of the original folder were .  The  only  way  to  see  or  disable  this  hidden  file  is  to  go  to  Tools  –  Options – View and set the option to “show hidden files and folders ”.  Until  this  is  done,  every  single  folder  with  pictures  in  it  will  store  a mini-snapshot  of  the  pictures  unless  this  is  disabled.  Windows  7  is  a completely  different  file  system  to  Windows  XP.  Instead  of  keeping  the thumbnail cache within the folder where the pictures reside, it stores it in a central location   %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer    I HAVE FOUND it  much  better  to  just  leave  the  thumbnail  option  off  in Windows 7, as the images load fairly quickly without the need for a cache to speed things up. There are other files, like text, audio and the like, that are  also  at  risk  of  being  discovered  if  you  do  not  take  precautions  to securely delete the file. That does not mean deleted from the recycle bin , however. When you delete any items from the recycle bin, all that does is tell the operating system that the space previously occupied by that file can be written to again. It does not delete the file permanently until that space is overwritten to again by some other program .  Government agencies have programs that can undelete a file. The way around  this  is  to  use  various  programs  to  securely  delete  a  file,  such  as Ccleaner. This app has an interesting wipe utility as well, in that it can wipe the free space of any previously deleted contents on the hard drive. You can even do this while the operating system is in use .  Needless  to  say,  if  you  have  a  2  terabyte  hard  drive  and  you’re  only using 20% of the drive, with 80% being “free space”, then it will be a few hours for it to finish the wipe process, dependent on the speed of the hard drive  and  what  other  programs  you  have  running.  It  does  not  touch  any installed programs that exist already on the system unless you tell it to, and then only that free space that is allocated for use .   Swap File  L  ET’S  TALK  briefly  about  the  “swap”  file  that  most  operating  systems use. What this means is that sometimes during heavy PC usage, you will run  low  on  system  memory,  and  then  the  operating  system  will  use  your hard  drive  as  a  temporary  ram  storage  device.  This  is  what  is  called  the “swap file”, which increases the speed of computer operations. This swap file  can  be  a  veritable  gold  mine  of  data  to  someone  with  nefarious intentions .  Text  files,  video  thumbnails,  and  word  document  fragments  can  exist herein, enough to print out a pretty good snapshot of your past. There have even been court cases where people were convicted in court using nothing but thumbnail fragments .  You can disable the swap file windows uses by going to control panel, System  &  Security,  System,  Advanced,  Performance,  Settings,  Advanced, Virtual Memory and click Change. Choose “No Paging File”. Reboot .  Note: Some resource intensive games use the swap file to speed up their games when there is not enough ram. If you run into any slowdowns with normal PC usage you can always switch this option back on, then reboot .   I2P  I 2P, otherwise known as the "Invisible Internet Project" is another option that  people  can  use  to  hide  their  online  IP  address.  It  shares  a  lot  of  the same  characteristics  of  other  networks  in  that  it  routes  traffic  through neighboring  peers.  The  developers  have  stated  that  their  main  goal  is  not necessarily  one  of  100%  anonymity   a  goal  some  say  is  impossible ,  but rather to make the system too troubling and expensive to attack from the outside.  It  is  an  anonymizing  network  with  several  layers  of  encryption wrapped around all the data that travels through the system .  I2P VS Tor  Y OU MIGHT THINK this sounds a lot like Freenet, but the similarity is actually  more  like  Tor's  network.  I2P  offers  interactivity  with  websites, blogs, forums, chat, search engines and all without the need to install any of them locally. Such are the hallmarks of I2P. Websites that exist in the I2P network are called Eepsites, and are hosted anonymously with I2P being a strict requirement to access these websites. In that vein, it is similar to the .onion sites accessible only via Tor. Every PC that is connected to the I2P network  shares  in  the  forwarding  of  encrypted  packets  of  data  through proxies prior to the final destination. Each subsequent proxy prunes a layer of encryption at various intervals until encryption is removed. The bottom line is this: No one knows the origin of said packets, a trait also shared by   Tor. While it is true that both Tor and I2P have different goals in mind, there exists many similarities :  - Both exist as anonymizing networks - Both use layered encryption to funnel data - Both have hidden services - Tor has Exit Nodes and I2P has Outproxies  Benefits of Tor over I2P  -  L  ARGER  USER  BASE  THAN  I2P;  support  from  academic  sources, constant improvements in stability and resistance to attacks  - Funding is sourced from many countries around the globe - Large number of Exit Nodes - Translated into many languages - Optimized for Exit Traffic - Memory more optimized than I2P - Written in C  Benefits of I2P over Tor  - H IDDEN SERVICES much faster than the Tor network .  - Not as many DOS  denial of service  attacks as Tor . - Compatible with peer-to-peer file sharing  Tor is not  . - Tor tunnels last a long time compared to I2P. This ensures less attacks  as the number of samples a hacker may use are limited .  - Every peer routes data for others . - Offers TCP UDP . - Written in Java .  A  S  YOU  CAN  SEE,  both  networks  are  safe  enough  for  anonymity,  as long  as  you  aren't  a  world-hunted  target.  To  this,  a  user's  anonymity  is typically  broken  due  to  their  own  sloppy  behavior--their  overconfidence   being the weakest link in most cases  using the same login names on many websites,  mixing  these  with  Tor  and  non-Tor  websites,  and  enabling JavaScript Flash  .  Since I2P is not built to act as a proxy to the WWW, you should use Tor if you want to surf anonymously. The outproxies on I2P, as you've probably guessed,  are  similar  to  the  exit  nodes  on  Tor,  but  they  do  not  have  the greatest  support  and  tend  to  be  unstable.  Thus  you  should  use  Tor  for anonymous  web  browsing  and  I2P  for  I2p  eepsites.  One  option  is  to  use Foxy Proxy to test it yourself. Be aware however that since there are fewer outproxies than Tor exit nodes, it may be easier for an adversary to identify your activities. It all depends on how much risk you want to assume and what the ramifications are if you are caught  and in which country  .  You  can  also  use  I2P  for  BitTorrent  and  iMule  as  well  as  other  P2P applications.  Like  Freenet,  you  will  find  that  I2P  will  grow  in  speed  the longer  you  use  it  without  interruption.  Torrents  will  be  faster.  Data  will come down like lightning. Tor users will thank you for it. There are already too many torrent users on Tor that clog the network and make it difficult for people  in  dire  straits  who  need  anonymity  for  their  political  actions  far more than the next Incubus CD .  While I2P is a technical powerhouse for anonymity, it can be a bit like a house of cards. Once the Ace is pulled from the bottom layer  by you , it can be rendered moot. I2P is just a tool, as is Tor and Freenet. It is not an invisibility cloak. Do something stupid, like move too much when a pack of Orcs are looking your way, you're bound to get an arrow in a place where you least expect it. Thus, act smart by being proactive in anonymity :  1 .  TURN OFF JAVASCRIPT  Yes, it bears repeating, with arms waving in the air and shouting at the top of our lungs. Javascript is the bane of not only Tor, but other networks that  rely  on  cloaking  your  IP  address.  Leaving  this  beastly  plugin  ON allows code to be run on your machine, code that will decloak you. Look at your  browser  settings  and  disable  it.  Also  disable  cookies.  Super  cookies are deployed in the wild to track down Tor users. Don't let it happen to you on I2P. Javascript can reveal a ton of metrics that fingerprint a user. Display resolution, page width, font and so on can be sent to an adversary by stealth. If you're in doubt, take a look at the web API at Mozilla :   H TTPS:  DEVELOPER.MOZILLA.ORG EN-US DOCS WEB  API  2 .  SILENCE IS GOLDEN !  D ON'T SAY A PEEP. Sure, you can talk. But refrain from discussing: the weather,  your  geography,  your  hobbies,  your  city  politician  that  was  just arrested for soliciting hookers. If someone says, "Hows the weather in your town?" You say: "Sunny." Every time. Alternatively, you may misinform. The  CIA  does  it,  why  can't  you?  Their  entire  organization  is  built  on secrecy  and  deception.  Don't  get  too  choked  up  about  a  few  white  lies. Spreading misinformation about trivial things like the weather and the local politics can really put a nail in an adversary's coffin. Ditto on employment. If  you  are  asked  about  your  work  and  you're  a  programmer,  say  you're  a mail sorter down at the Post Office. They're not going to ask you about the latest Elvis stamp .  3 .  ROTATE USERNAMES  NICS  The desire for convenience often gets people in trouble. They use the same usernames on multiple sites forums. That's fine for the daytime, open web.  Not  so  much  for  the  darknet.  It  breaks  anonymity.  Take  forums  for example.  When  your  username  becomes  infamous  for  a  wealth  of knowledge, change it. Create a new one. Don't tell anyone. Entropy rises when many users swap information like this on a frequent basis. Maintain separate  personas:  one  for  internet. Memorization is better than writing it down .  the  darknet,  one  for  regular   4 .  NEVER TURN off your router  I  never  turn  mine  off.  Ever.  If  it  is  constantly  going  on  and  off  while Freenet, Tor, I2P or IRC is running, after a while clues will surface as to   who  I  really  am,  provided  a  sufficiently  determined  adversary  has  the resources to do it  NSA . The cost in power is negligible, so don't go cheap with anonymity. As the saying goes: out of speed, anonymity and reliability, you can only pick two, but make up for the lost component by acting smart .  5 .  POWER IN NUMBERS: Bandwidth  Don't be stingy with your connection. The more you participate in the storm of users  Freenet, I2P , the more cloaked you will be. It is better to run 24 7 if you can. This makes it more difficult for an adversary to discern if you sent a file to someone else, or if you are merely the middle man to some file sent by a total unknown on the other side of the globe. Besides this,  leaving  the  program  running  just  makes  it  a  lot  faster  network  in general for other users. Think Safety in Numbers .  6 .  OPTIONAL  but smart   the  browser  settings   In   to  false.  Search  goliaths  browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled  Google and Microsoft do not need to know the website URLs you visit .  ,  set  browser.safebrowsing.enabled  and like  Get into the habit of flushing the cache--cookies, etc. You can set this to  do it automatically upon exit of the browser .  Refrain from using Foxy Proxy to selective proxy .i2p links. You don't want to be sent to the clearnet. If an I2P website is a honeypot, your Firefox browser  can  send  a  unique  identifier  in  the  referrer,  in  which  case... anonymity broken .  At this point you're probably thinking this is way more headaches than it is worth. And you'd be right...in the beginning. But anything worth doing is usually hard at the outset. I as well as my colleagues do all of these things only because we have done them for years .  We do them every day . Are we thinking about them ? No, not in the least on account of smart habits done daily. Do you think intently about starting your car? Pulling out of the driveway? No. But it's a good bet you were petrified to do it when you were sixteen. And pulling out   of  your  driveway  is  a  very  complex  action,  as  are  the  aforementioned suggestions. Just one of your brain cells is more complex than a 747. Don't waste any of them .  Torrents and Eepsites  F IRST THINGS FIRST. Install not only the NoScript plugin, but also the Cookie  Whitelist   Buttons .  Ideally  you  want  to  block  everything  when surfing Eepsites. There are a multitude of add-ons on the Firefox site  but you  do  not  need  all  of  them.  You  only  need  the  ones  that  preserve  your anonymity .  I NSTALL QUICKPROXY, also at the Firefox site. Restart. Then open the proxy  settings  using  the  edit  tab  and  then  browse  to  "Preferences"  and "Advanced". Then "Settings". Change your proxy settings to :  127.0.0.1 for HTTP Proxy, Port 4444 and 127.0.0.1 and port 4445 for  SSL Proxy. Ensure Socks v4 is checked .  C LICK "OKAY" and exit out. If you've configured it correctly you should be able to click the QuickProxy icon  lower corner of browser  when you browse Eepsites. You can also paste in .i2p websites and hit "Go" the old fashioned way .  Torrents  A N OPTION for torrents is to use I2PSnark. If you're a beginner, ensure the service is running by opening a terminal and inputing :  $ I 2PROUTER STATUS   I F IT IS NOT RUNNING, start it with :  $ I 2PROUTER STATUS  T HEN BROWSE via Firefox to  H TTP:  LOCALHOST:7657  I2PSNARK    A T THE MAIN I2PSNARK PAGE, you can see it running. Now you can create a torrent. Move a torrent and the data into  ~ .I 2P  I2PSNARK  T HE OTHER OPTION is to paste the data you want to seed to the same directory, and in my case, this is usually PDFs and technical manuals. At the Tracker option, you can choose whatever method you wish or create an entirely  new  torrent.  I2PSnark  will  create  the  new  torrent  and  set  it  in  a queue.  All  that  remains  to  be  done  is  to  click  Start  in  the  top  corner  and away you go .  Get your torrents from Postman's tracker :  H TTP:  TRACKER2. POSTMAN.I2P     T ORRENTS MIGHT BE slow at first, but do not get discouraged. You will have far faster downloads on I2P than you ever will Tor. One can never have enough good karma in this world .   FACEBOOK AND OTHER MISFITS  F acebook is a bit of a mixed bag where ethics is concerned. On the one hand, it is immensely popular and profit-inducing for a reason: people love to chat with relatives, old neighborhood friends, girlfriends, mistresses and political liaisons, all in real-time. People love connections. The feeling of unity and solidarity. The benefits are fairly immediate if you’re the type of individual  who  likes  instant  gratification.  There  is  nothing  quite  like  the feeling of seeing old friends on your friend’s list who you have not seen in twenty-five years, now instantly accessible for a chat session at just about any time of day .  It used to be that Facebook didn't rely as much on the IP address as a P2P  network  did.  Times  have  changed.  Nowadays,  all  of  your  personal information  is  theirs  for  the  taking,  and  in  some  cases  offered  up  on  a digital platter by endusers. Your real name, phone number, who your past and present friends are, and even your pets are all valuable data as it can be targeted with advertising tailored to every atom of your personality. What could go wrong, you ask ?  One  problem  facing  Facebook  users  is  that  it  is  all  too  easy  for Facebook to give this treasure trove of data up to the highest bidder. Worse, Facebook acts not as a protector of the 4th amendment, but as an destroyer of it. Many government agencies and local law enforcement have relied on Facebook  profiles  to  establish  alibis,  reveal  private  emails,  and  prove  or disprove acts that may be criminal or not. Read the Facebook privacy policy for yourself :   " W E MAY ALSO SHARE information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily  harm,  or  to  protect  ourselves  and  you  from  people  violating  our Statement  of  Rights  and  Responsibilities.  This  may  include  sharing information  with  other  companies,  lawyers,  courts  or  other  government entities . "  T HEY'RE MANDATED by the government to abide by subpoenas for user information data except any private messages that are unopened and are less than  181  days  of  age   these  require  a  warrant .  The  problem  is  that  the Supreme Court never recognized a 4th amendment right to privacy. That is, data being shared with third parties, so the government pretty much has a blank  check  to  engage  in  “shooting-fish-in-a-barrel”  type  expeditions  for subscriber information that may or may not have anything to do with any criminal acts .  State  and  corporation  are  thus  conjoined  at  the  hip  in  a  quasi-fascism that  is  difficult  to  defeat  and  predict,  nevermind  the  fact  that  the government  often,  when  it  has  nothing  else  to  do,  creates  laws  that  are meant to be broken--over and over  speed limits, anyone ? .  Thus,  outside  of  discussions  on  anonymity,  there  is  a  not  much  to  do when the enemy's archers are standing upon the castle towers with flaming arrows aimed at the exposed king. But we'll try nevertheless .  Be mindful of what you type on Facebook. Actually, be paranoid, unless you  are  one  of  the  king's  fools.  This  should  go  without  saying,  but  the neverending stream of fools on Facebook often don't even recognize your need  for  privacy  or  anonymity  to  say  nothing  of  their  own.  They  get  so accustomed to the personalized interface that you start to think they've got in it for you with their shouting your real name across the internet .  You are not anonymous here, or on any other social media site--Twitter,  Pinterest, Google Plus, etc .  In  fact,  a  new  Facebook  account  has  even  less  privacy  than  one  on  a P2P network like Emule. Where emule is concerned, you only had to worry about  the  ip  address.  With  Facebook,  your  private  life  belongs  to  them unless you take drastic action to prevent it. Yes, you may have heard more than  a  few  complaints  from  a  few  peasants  about  the  lack  of  privacy  on   Social  Media.  It  hasn't  failed  to  reached  the  ears  of  the  ivory  tower executives at Facebook, Inc. But what do they really think of anonymity ?  T HE ANOMALY: Anonymous Facebook Login  I  N  APRIL  OF  2014,  CEO  Mark  Zuckerberg  announced  that  Facebook planned to implement "Anonymous Login" for all users. It was a misnomer in  the  same  way  that  "cat  owner"  is  a  misnomer.  It  offers  more  privacy, certainly, but not anonymity. It doesn't come close to anonymity since you cannot login to Facebook anonymously . What it means is that, using your Facebook login, you can sign in to other websites, say at Ars Technica or Wired, and make comments without having to grant access to the treasure of  data  Facebook  holds  on  you:  your  list  of  contacts,  relatives,  friends, favorite cereals and the fact you hate cats with a brimstone passion .  Presently  they  are  testing  this  so  called  "anonymity"  service  with  a smattering of social sites and forums so as to better "benefit the end-user", as  Zuckerberg  claims--grant  more  control  to  its  userbase  on  some  of  the data that gets transferred. Notice the word "some"... of the data. Not all .  And herein is the fallacy: most people, especially those on social media, do  not  know  the  difference  between  anonymity  and  privacy.  Thus  the masses  will  gobble  it  up.  Certainly  signing  up  for  a  new  service  can  be cumbersome--email, check link, clink on link, fill out forms, click another link in email, fill out more forms. It's a breath of fresh air to know simpler times are in the pipeline, but let's call it what is: efficiency, not anonymity . Most  people  will  think  Facebook  will  stand  true  to  their  anonymity statement, but the truth of it is that they lied to their userbase right out of the gate,  trading  the  mundane  term  privacy  for  the  much  loftier  goal  of anonymity . Facebook knows all about these third party sites you visit, and is willing to offer the data up to the highest bidder .  Your  behavior,  your  identity,  your  favorites,  all  are  a  win-win  for Facebook, and a lose-lose for the third party sites and you . If a nosy judge wants to uncloak you on a third party site over some "slanderous" comment you  made,  they  need  not  go  to  the  third  party  site.  They  will  go  to   Facebook. They know the name you signed in with, the time you made the comment, the IP address you used to bounce to the discussion. Checkmate . In  an  interview  with  Wired's  Steve  Levy,  Zuckerberg  had  this  to  say  about their new vision :  "W  HEN  WE  WERE  A  SMALLER  COMPANY,  Facebook  login  was widely adopted, and the growth rate for it has been quite quick. But in order to get to the next level and become more ubiquitous, it needs to be trusted even more. We’re a bigger company now and people have more questions. We  need  to  give  people  more  control  over  their  information  so  that everyone feels comfortable using these products ."  S OUNDS SUSPICIOUS, does it not? Well, that's not to say it's good for the goose either. In this case, the third party. Website developers who decide to  use  Facebook's  API  to  expand  their  readership  will  have  that  decision come back to haunt them since Facebook "controls" the client that uses the API login. They can shut off the API for the developers just as Nevada can shut off water piping out to California. To counter this, they will be ever more vigilant in mining user data and be hesitant, if not fully opposed, to using this new "anonymous" setting as it grants Facebook absolute rule over its userbase. That is, if they were smart . Many are not .  H OW TO BE Anonymous on Facebook  F ACEBOOK IS ALLERGIC TO ANONYMITY. You've  probably  heard that  they  frown  on  anonymous  accounts.  It  is  not  entirely  difficult  to understand  why.  They  can't  target  you  with  advertisements  if  they  don't know  who  you  are,  and  that's  their  bread  and  butter.  From  your  behavior come  the  metrics,  the  things  you  buy,  the  places  you  enjoy  visiting,  your family links. From their own lips :   "W E REQUIRE everyone to provide their real names, so you always know who you're connecting with ."  T  HIS  IS  a  roadblock  that  fortunately  can  be  overcome,  since  genuine names are not yet tied to any form of government ID schemes like driver's licenses  or  social  security  numbers   though  they  will  be  someday .  And even then, the rules of supply and demand would dictate even this would not dissuade the need for full anonymity .  When you are neck-deep in the account creation process at Facebook, you  need  to  enter  as  much  false  data  as  you  can.  The  email  address  in particular needs to be created in complete anonymity. The big mistake most people make is assuming that clocking the IP address is a sufficient means to  the  end.  However  there  are  many  tracking  mechanisms--complex algorithms  designed  to  match  behavior  patterns  and  preferential  choices-- that all the big social media giants employ. Just one slip up, a broken link in the  chain  such  as  connecting  to  a  website  that  knows  your  real  identity  BBC, for instance  can destroy your every effort. Before you know it, all the  others  have  been  alerted  by  bots,  warning  pings  and  moderators  that you've talked to in that session. Endgame .  Ask yourself this: Would your closest friends refer to you by name if you  attended  a  popular  masquerade  in  New  Orleans  during  Mardi  Gras? You bet they would, masked or not, even if you had pleaded with them to protect  your  identity.  Some  of  them  might  whisper  your  name,  not  really even thinking about their prior oath of secrecy .  Then before you know it, another who happens to have the ears of a fox overhears  your  name  being  called.  In  much  the  same  way,  Facebook identifies  you  by  your  acquaintances  just  as  others  might  do  at  the masquerade. Who is he talking to? A woman? Young or old? Tall or short? Do they talk with their hands? Ah, that's Maria from Rome. It's really not too  difficult,  and  neither  is  it  for  Facebook.  Friends  and  family  lists  are hardline  identifiers  in  Facebook  and  Google's  algorithms.  The  facial recognition Facebook employs can only get more advanced as it scours the web  for  matches  elsewhere:  Flickr.  Google.  Amazon.  Twitter.  Mugshot sites.  Surveillance  videos.  Then  there  are  photos  of  you  to  worry  about: photos your friends have that are out of your control .   Facebook installs super cookies on your machine  or one of their many 3rd party enforcers  that tracks you in a number of ways: by Sid number, MAC address, etc. It continues to track you even after you've logged out of all your social media sites. There can be no such event as 100% anonymity just as there can be no such thing as a perfect human. We are the weak links .  But fear not, young Jedi. All is not yet lost . While true anonymity is difficult, it is not impossible. We can approach 98%  anonymity  with  some  smart  decisions.  First  things  first.  Invest  in  a VPN  account.  The  more  walls  we  have  between  us  and  the  target,  the stronger  the  cloak.  Visibility  is  cloudy  in  a  VPN  as  they  shield  many  of your  moves.  Location  awareness  is  difficult  to  detect  using  a  VPN,  but avoid  free  public  proxies  as  Facebook  and  every  other  site  has  been spammed  to  death  with  them  and  have  shielded  themselves  from  those range of IP addresses. Thus, a proper  well-respected  VPN is the way to go. You will want speed to blend in with other non-anonymous users. Every metric counts .  You  will  need  to  disable  most  cookies  from  third-parties  but  allow Facebook for each session. Using Firefox portable, you can set the browser to auto-clear them upon exiting each session .  Set  up  your  false  data.  Everything  must  be  different  from  anything you've set at any other forum. Ars Technica, Wired, WSJ--they're all in bed with Facebook to one degree or another. Ensure complete uniqueness, and under no circumstances give them your mobile phone number, as this will nuke your anonymity before it gets off the ground. That number, along with the  IP,  is  used  primarily  for  targeted  advertising  as  well  as  by  law enforcement.  You  may  have  noticed  that  Yahoo  now  requires  it  for  new accounts. The reason is that it makes things easier to identify you .  Avoid  a  large  group  of  friends  and  NO  RELATIVES.  This  can't  be stressed  enough.  Relatives,  especially  the  elderly,  love  to  gossip  and  spill details about the retched veal you cooked last night, or the cat you sprayed with the garden hose last week. What you don't hear in other's chat boxes at Facebook can harm you. Politely tell  never ask  others not to tag you or refer to any events that may compromise you: pictures, videos, music that your "real self" enjoys. Three breadcrumbs is enough to raise the eyebrow of the algorithm. Insist on them calling you by a nickname. If they refuse, remove them .   Never use the same browser for your VPN that you use for non-VPN sessions. Install Firefox portable in its own directory with its own shortcut and configured to the VPN BEFORE creating the Facebook account. Never mix them up. You don't want cross-cookie contamination .  Be  cautious  on  other  social  sites  as  well:  Google,  Twitter,  Pinterest, MySpace. Facebook will not invest in the resources to find you unless you hand them crumbs of data yourself, which can easily be done on other sites you  are  careless  with.  So  avoid  being  too  specific  about  things  related  to your hardwired beliefs on those other sites, too: Religion. Politics. Ethics. Switch them up. Be a Buddhist for a session or two. Or a non-practicing non-denominationalist.  Just  be  mindful  of  stirring  up  a  hornet's  nest.  A friend in Thailand  an American  who was well known in Freenet insulted the Thai king on Facebook, prompting them to take a magnifying glass to his  account.  The  end  result?  Facebook  changed  his  name  without  his authorization--to reflect his real identity . Embarrassing. He'd posted a link to his page on Freenet as well and as you can imagine, his entire identity was uncovered by this loud behavior .  It  is  not  possible  to  convert  your  existing  Facebook  profile  into  an anonymous one no matter how many tweaks you make. Changing the name will do nothing. The algorithm  think of the sentinels from The Matrix  will still  have  records  of  your  online  behavior  as  well  as  your  IP  address. Privacy,  however,  is  obtainable,  in  case  you  wish  to  shield  your  identity from nosy coworkers or other misfits. In this case you need to change your username, that part of the profile others see then tweak the privacy settings accordingly with how invisible you wish to be. It is a bit of a double-edged sword since this will make it harder for others to see you--those you may wish to see you. You'll have to seek them out yourself and add them. And this, too, can reveal your true identity. Nothing typed into Facebook is ever truly invisible from the bots at their disposal .   TAILS  E dward Snowden. The name rings a bell for most people around the globe. In tech circles he is a visionary. As for the non-techies, a few labels come to mind: Whistleblower. Hero. Traitor. Regardless of what you pin him with, one thing is certain: He hates censorship and loves anonymity, the kind of anonymity that calls for untrackable execution. Before discussing anything, he insisted liaisons use not only PGP  pretty good privacy  but the end-all- be-all of anonymity tools :  Tails It is a simple tool that frustrates even those in the upper echelon of the NSA. And for good reason, since even they do not know the wizard who designed it .  Where Tor is the worm of the anonymous fisherman, Tails is the fishing box. The fish at the other end have no idea who is inside the boat, watching, listening. It's a hacker's tool but also a patriot weapon. Using it is a breeze: install  it  on  a  USB  stick,  CD,  whatever,  boot  from  said  stick  and  find yourself cloaked and shielded from the NSA, provided that you don't out yourself. And if you're using Tails, you're smarter than that anyway .  Built upon the shell of Linux, it acts as an operating system and comes with  an  assortment  of  nukes  to  launch  under  Big  Brother's  nose:  Tor browser,  chat  client,  email,  office  suite  and  image sound  editor,  among others .  Snowden preferred Tails on account of its no-write rule: no direct data writing. A breach from a remote adversary? Not going to happen. Forensics investigation?  Nope.  No  trace  is  going  to  be  left  on  the  DVD USB. Obviously this is a no brainer to use if you're an NSA employee looking to   spill  the  beans  on  unconstitutional  spying,  as  well  as  a  must-have  for political dissidents and journalists. It is armored with plausible deniability, the same as Truecrypt .  Tor runs like warm butter when you boot with Tails. There's not much of a learning curve, and no excessive tweaking required. You can use it in the same PC you use at work. Boot from USB or DVD. Do your thing then reboot back into your normal PC with no record or footprint of your Tailing. For all intents, you're a ghost on the internet. And speaking of ghosts, the creators of Tails are anonymous themselves. No one knows their identities. But what we do know is that they will not bow to governments trying to muscle a backdoor into the code .  Linus  Torvalds,  creator  of  Linux,  said  in  2013,  "The  NSA  has  been pressuring free software projects and developers in various ways," implying that they had made the effort, and all with taxpayer funds. A bit like the cat saying to the mouse, "Transparency is good for you. Sleep out in the open and  not  the  damp  and  dark,  flea-infested  mousehole."  They  don't  like secrets .  You might be asking, how do we know that Tails does not already have a backdoor? How do we know that the NSA has not already greased their hands? The evidence is twofold: the code is open-source  anyone can audit it , and the mere fact that the NSA made an effort to sideline end-users says they fear such a powerful package. They cannot peer inside to see what the mice are doing. Snowden claimed that the NSA, while he was with them, was a major thorn in the side of that organization .  At the time of Tails conception five years ago, the interest had already started to build up in the Tor community for a more cohesive toolbox. "At that time some of us were already Tor enthusiasts and had been involved in free software communities for years,” they said. “But we felt that something was missing to the panorama: a toolbox that would bring all the essential privacy enhancing technologies together and made them ready to use and accessible to a larger public ."  PGP is also included in package. You owe it to yourself and peace of mind  to  learn  it.  Spend  a  Sunday  with  it  and  you'll  be  a  competent  user. Spend a week and you'll be an enthusiast .  As  well,  KeePassX  can  be  useful  if  you  want  to  store  different  info  usernames,  pass  phrases,  sites,  comments   into  one  database.  These  two are like a good set of gauntlets no aspiring black knight would do without.   And don't think the blacksmiths have just smelted down some cheap metal, either. The designers have gone to a lot of trouble to modify the privacy and security settings. The more they do, the less you have to .  This is not to say you should use Tails every day. Only use it in those times  you  feel  anonymity  is  warranted.  As  mentioned  before,  if  you  start mixing  up  services,  operating  systems  and  mac  addresses,  you  may  blow your  cover.  Though  Tails  is  packaged  with  programs  that  one  wouldn't normally associate with anonymity  GIMP, OpenOffice, Audacity, etc  you don't  want  to  leak  info  where  an  adversary  might  build  a  profile  on  you. You'd be shocked at how many applications these days "dial home" without your knowledge  hint: almost all of them  .  But the true Achilles heel is the metadata . Tails is really lousy at hiding it. It doesn't try to. It doesn't clear any of it nor does it encrypt the headers of your encrypted emails. Are you an ebook author? Be careful about PDFs and .mobi files, as depending on which software you use, it can store the author's name and creation date of your work. But this is not really the fault of Tails. Rather, it is the wishes of the development team to stay compatible with the SMTP protocol .  The other problem with metadata is pictures: JPEGs, TIFF, BITMAPS and so on, which again, depending on the software, can store EXIF data-- data  that  stores  the  date  the  picture  was  taken  as  well  as  the  GPS coordinates of the image. Newer cameras and mobile phones like Samsung Galaxy are notorious for this, and even keep a thumbnail of the EXIF data intact for nose parkers with nothing to do all day but to sniff through other people's property. A fake GPS spoofer may be useful but even that won't eliminate the exif data. You'll need a separate app for this. You might even go so far as to only use formats that don't store any metadata at all. Plain- text is one option, though even that can be watermarked .  You  might  think,  "Can  I  hide  Tails  activity?"  The  short  answer  is: maybe. It depends on the resources of the adversary. And just who is the adversary?  The  government?  The  private  detective?  The  employer?  The fingerprint Tails leaves is far less visible than what Tor leaves. And yes, it is possible for an administrator to see you are using Tor, as well as your ISP. They  cannot  tell  what  you're  doing  on  Tor,  mind  you,  but  there  are  Tor Browser Bundle users, and Tails users. It all comes down to the sites you visit .   We've seen how they can build a profile on you from your resolution, window  metrics,  addons  and  extensions  and  time  zones  and  fonts,  but  to alleviate  this  the  Tails  developers  have  tried  to  make  everyone  look  the same,  as  if  they  were  all  wearing  white  Stormtrooper  armor.  Some  fall through  the  cracks,  making  themselves  easier  for  a  correlation  attack  by installing  too  many  addons  and  thus  marking  themselves  in  the  herd:  A purple-colored stormtrooper, if you will. Such and such user has a nice font enhancer while no other user does. This alone does not break anonymity, but with a hundred other factors and sufficient resources, it might be the one detail that breaks the house of cards. Death by a thousand stings .  You  might  find  Tor  bridges   alternative  entry  points  on  Tor   to  be  a good investment in reading, as they can better hide you from your ISP. In fact, using a bridge makes it considerably harder for your ISP to even know you are using Tor. If you decide this route  and you should if merely using Tor can get you arrested-- a case in which you should NOT use the default Tor configuration , the bridge address must be known .  Be  mindful  of  the  fact  that  a  few  bridges  can  be  obtained  on  the  Tor website. If you know about it, others do too--even adversaries like the NSA, but it is still stronger for anonymity purposes than the default Tor config. Like  Freenet,  it  would  be  optimal  if  you  personally  know  someone  in  a country outside the USA who runs a private obfuscated bridge that has the option PublishServerDescriptor 0 . As always, luck favors the prepared .   HOW TO DEFEAT THE NSA  I  t  needs  to  be  said:  The  time  is  nigh  for  the  NSA  to  dissolve.  If  not dissolved, then at least broken up as Nazi Germany was after WWII. Yeah I hear your eyes rolling. Comparing the Nazis again? Please .  But mission creep, the expansion of a project beyond its original goals  often  after  initial  successes   has  reared  its  ugly  head  once  again  as  the NSA,  once  known  as  "No  Such  Agency",  has  far  surpassed  its  original purpose: to secure American communications while gathering intel on our enemies. Unfortunately, it seems we have become the enemy. We, the path of least resistance, so to speak .  Intelligence gathering is now such a high priority to the NSA that it has gone  global  at  the  expense  of  sovereign  security.  The  Tailored  Access Operations  TAO  directive makes this obvious. Install spyware backdoors on the enemy's computers... well and good until Snowden revealed that they do  the  same  to  their  own  countrymen.  It's  called  bulk  surveillance  .  The more data they have, the louder they are on claiming victory over the usual boogeymen: Terrorists. Drug lords.  how long was it to catch Bin Laden? . Emails, calls, even video is collected without your consent. You could say it is a system ripe for abuse, if it were not already rotting from the inside out due  to  the  Patriot  Act   section  215 .  The  very  notion  that  the  NSA  can shield  itself  from  Congress  and  the  taxpayers  who  foot  the  bill  should appall most Americans .  So,  what  to  do  when  the  mother  eagle  turns  on  her  chicks?  Answer: Build your own nest. First things first, however. Understand that if you are a high value target like Bin Laden or a Mafia don, the NSA will hack your internet-connected computer or phone regardless. There's no getting around   it.  If  you're  thinking,  "Well,  I  paid  a  hundred  clams  for  Drivecrypt  and Phonecrypt and so it is safe from those hucksters," there is some bad news for you to swallow, cowboy. It is far from safe .  Drivecrypt is commercial software and closed-source, and considering the free offerings out there  Truecrypt--open-source and audited  , the best case would be that you're only paying for the name. Worst case? The NSA has a backdoor within the code, or at least knows of an exploit no one else knows  about.  You  can  thank  the  NSA's  BULLRUN  program,  which attempts  to  "insert  vulnerabilities  into  commercial  encryption  systems,  IT systems, networks and endpoint communication devices ."  In  an  ideal,  pro-Constitution  country,  the  security  of  the  citizenry against foreign threats would be priority one. Instead, we are faced with a well-funded  behemoth  that  considers  the  monitoring  and  data  farming  of citizens priority one. Again, think "least resistance". Hacked accounts from Blizzard  to  Kickstarter  to  Yahoo  occur  every  month  and  the  NSA  seems helpless  to  stop  it.  Only  the  truth  is  a  little  different  than  they  led  us  to believe .  They do have the means to stop it, as it turns out. But it would require a significant  rerouting  of  resources  so  that  citizens  are  protected  and  not monitored and assumed guilty of some obscure crime. Worse, the positions of  authority  and  influence  are  unbalanced  and  skewed.  Cyber  Command should not be integrated with NSA priorities at all. Their priorities should be focused abroad, like all other military operations , and not focused on citizens like some Eye of Sauron that creates crime out of thin air .  Luckily,  a  few  have  leaked  enough  data  from  the  NSA's  coffers  to mount a counteroffensive. One man cannot undo the damage they've done, but a nation can: the millions can overpower their overreach and send them back to their proper place .  How ? Knowledge is power. This hardly changes over time and for the NSA, the knowledge resides in the network itself. That's where the NSA loves to probe and plant their bugs. To this, they farm all the data. Everything. Then hire analysts to sort it all. They monitor phone calls, satellite messages and even listen to the oceanic cables running to and fro to our allies. They tap the waterfall at the source, high above, or beneath our feet if need be. Good intel, ripe for the sifting .   But  what  is  good  intel  to  them?  Well,  it's  whatever  sets  off  the  most flags:  the  people  involved,  their  countries,  the  language  they  use,  their religion. It all gets prioritized based on profiles their algo agents categorize. The more red flags, the higher up the totem pole it goes... into a wellspring of metadata . It is easier to cherry pick targets by examining metadata than to study complete emails and conversations. It saves time. It saves money. Metadata to the NSA is like cocaine to a drug dealer. It's valuable stuff .  The Systems Intelligence Directorate does the data sifting and sorting in this case, and is given billions by Congress to optimize its operations every year. They are always updating and honing their capabilities. Testing what works and what doesn't. A security group exists for each directive handed down by the brass. They do nothing but look for ways to streamline each infiltration  tactic.  Make  it  all  blood  simple  with  the  push  of  a  button,  a button that has global outreach .  NSA agents can infiltrate at will, but they especially love non-updated hardware  like  routers.  When  was  the  last  time  you  updated  your  router encryption key? Right. The NSA knows this as well. They have a backdoor for  many  of  them  and  entire  teams  devoted  24 7  to  finding  exploits  for every  brand  of  router  and  password  encryption  scheme.  This  is  all accomplished by the TAO  Tailored Access Operations  . Once inside your PC,  they  can  easily  install  a  custom-made  keylogger  that  records  your keystrokes and will send them quietly under the radar. Your anti-virus will not  detect  it.  Once  this  is  done,  it  doesn't  matter  how  complex  your password is. Thus, it is easy to see how valuable prevention is .  But how does one prevent such an intrusion from a well-funded entity? The answer is encryption . Encrypt your email. Your data. Your boot pass phrase.  Most  people  will  not  bother  with  email.  Some  might  bother  with data. And fewer still will bother with encrypting the entire OS as it can take hours for a 2TB hard drive .  A few strict security suggestions :  I  The NSA does not like Tor. It's expensive to track users. When a lot of money is asked of Congress, they start asking questions and demanding results. They don't want anyone asking questions. So use Tor. However, do not  say  anything  in  an  email  that  you  would  not  recover  from  if  it  was   broadcasted on network TV. And do not access your normal email account or bank account using Tor. Can you see why ?  II.  Invest in an offline netbook or laptop for mission critical data. Make encrypted  backups:  Blu-Ray,  USB,  SD.  Never  allow  the  data  onto  your internet PC unless in encrypted form: Truecrypt containers PGP encrypted, etc. Only decrypt messages offline and away from the internet. Learn about SSL IPsec.  Many  Usenet  providers  offer  SSL  for  free  but  leave  it  off  by default. Turn it on .  III.   Whenever  possible,  avoid  commercial  encryption  packages.  The proprietary software is almost never audited, unlike Truecrypt. What does that tell you when they are afraid of people looking at their code? They're hiding something from you. When an encryption program is open-source, it is  more  secure,  not  less,  because  others  can  verify  its  security  and  detect any back doors. Word spreads like wildfire when a backdoor is discovered, but not if the door is nailed shut from the other side .  IV.  Your screen lock does not have to be perfect. It won't keep out any government agents but it may keep out nosy wives and friends. If however the OS is not encrypted and your laptop is stolen, all your data is theirs for the taking. Use an open-source app like Password Safe to secure them all from prying eyes .  Y ou're probably thinking, why do you need all of these tools for privacy? Shouldn't Truecrypt or SSL for your Usenet be enough? The short answer is: it depends. It depends on your own level of risk. What you can live with if all is lost. And your loss is the NSA's gain, through threats of lawsuits and  coercions  and  unconstitutional  spying.  They've  almost  succeeded  in turning the web into a vast Orwellian looking glass-- with themselves as the only keymasters. They can only succeed if good men do nothing .  Trust encryption like you trust ammunition. And like ammunition, it can be learned in a weekend. Mastery however takes some time and effort, but know that by itself, it will do nothing but allow tyranny to flourish unless used for its original purpose .  Endgame   H opefully if you have read this far, then you are now aware of some of the dangers that await us in the future. Clearly, having an exposed IP address is only  a  drop  in  the  ocean  next  to  the  coming  power  grab.  Unfortunately, there  are  always  going  to  be  up  and  coming  social  networks  and applications that try to go above and beyond the use of the IP address to monitor you. We have seen it happen with many personal applications over the  years:  Internet  Explorer,  Napster,  Limewire,  Myspace,  Facebook  and the like .  These make their profits by subverting your personal choices and then targeting you based on those choices, and when you get right down to it, the longer  you  put  off  protecting  your  individuality,  the  less  choice  you  will have in the long run. However, you now have at least an effective arsenal of tools in which to minimize this subversion. If enough people take notice, it may stem or even reverse the tide of fascism coming over the hills .  More  and  more  we  are  seeing  a  gradual  erosion  of  privacy.  Some employers reject applicants to entry level positions based on credit score. Some employers demand Facebook usernames and passwords before hire. Some fire employees for words on a Facebook post. In the end it is all about control and eroding individual choice. For there is no one in the universe more unique than you. You are worth more than all the stars combined, and they  know  it.  And  want  to  control  it.  And  there  is  no  such  thing  as controlling just a little bit of a star .  Stay safe, always .   TOR & THE DARK ART OF  ANONYMITY   TABLE OF CONTENT  I s Tor Safe ?

Invisibility. Anonymity. Ghost protocol . You've taken the red pill and have seen the truth, and you don't like it. I don't blame you. I didn't like it either. But what I thought I knew about Tor and other incognito tools was only a drop in the ocean next to what's really out there. Stuff you don't find on many tech forums. They're whispered in private, of course, and it's all been rather invisible to you unless you hang out in hacker forums or Usenet. That is, until now .  Which  brings  us  to  you  and  I,  or  rather  what  I  can  do  for  you.  It's amazing what a guy can learn in a decade when he rolls his sleeves up and gets his hands dirty. Private hacker forums. Usenet. Freenet. I scoured them all for years and what I've learned isn't anywhere else on Amazon .  Equally amazing is what you can learn for a few dollars in a weekend's worth  of  reading.  That's  me,  and  soon  to  be  you .  Where  you  will  be  by Monday is where I am now, only without the years of mistakes. Mistakes I made using Freenet, Tails, PGP. You name it, I did it. And boy did I make big  ones:  mistakes  you'll  avoid  because  after  you  read  this  guide,  you'll know  more  than  85%  of  the  Tor  users  out  there,  and  know  more  about anonymity than most Federal agents. Yes, even the so-called super hackers at the NSA .  If you don't come away satisfied, return it for a full refund . But I know you won't. Because once you've taken the red pill, there ain't no going back. You can't unlearn what you've learned, unsee what you've seen, and you'll want more. Much, much more .   First off , we're not sticking with the basics here. If all you want is Tor for Dummies, look elsewhere. Where we're going is dangerous territory. It's shark territory when you get right down to it. But not to worry. We've got shark  repellant  and  everything  you  need  to  surf  safe.  You'll  reap  benefits you've  only  dreamed  of  and  by  the  time  we're  done,  you'll  have  gained NSA-level anonymity skills with a counter-surveillance mindset that rivals anything Anonymous or those goons at the NSA can counter with .  Speaking of which, they won't have a clue as to how to find you . Secondly  ,  for  a  few  dollars  you  will  know  every  exploit  those superhackers like to wield against Tor users and more: How to avoid NSA tracking.  Bitcoin  anonymity   real  anonymity ,  opsec  advice  and  Darknet markets  and  Darkcoins  and,  well,  it's  a  long  list  frankly  but  by  the  time you're done you'll be a Darknet artist when it comes to marketplaces and buying things incognito .  Third  ,  we'll  go  over  many  techniques  used  by  the  CIA  and  FBI  to entrap users. False confessions. Clickbait. Tor honeypots. It's all the same. You'll  learn  the  same  techniques  used  to  catch  terrorists,  hackers  and  the group Anonymous and couriers for Reloaded. Baits and Lures and how to spot an LEA agent from a mile away. I break it all down into simple steps that you can understand. A few dollars for this info will save you a lifetime of grief. No, you won't find it on Reddit or Ars Technica or Wired. If you're mulling  this  over,  don't.  You  need  this  now,  not  when  you're  framed  for something you didn't do .  Fourth  ...  reading  the  dangerous  material  herein  requires  you  take  action .  you act .  The Feds take action. Identity thieves take action. Hackers take action. Will you? Make no mistake - This is not a mere guide. It is a mindset . It's professional level stuff meant to keep you and your family safe for a decade out,  going  far  beyond  apps  and  proxies.  And  it's  all  yours  if  you  do  two simple things: You read, then act. Simple. Because you know what they say: Knowledge is power .  No, strike that. Knowledge is potential power. Your power. But only if  Fifth  ...  I  update  this  book  every  month.  New  browser  exploit  in  the wild? I update it here. New technique for uncloaking Tor users? You'll read it here first. We all know how Truecrypt is Not Safe Anymore, but that's only the beginning .   Besides, freedom isn't free . Lastly ... The scene from Jurassic Park with Dennis Nedry, I believe, is a  nice  frightful  analogy  to  what  happens  if  you  don't  take  your  security seriously.  We  see  poor  Dennis  try  to  get  his  jeep  out  of  the  muck  in  the middle of a tropical storm. Lightning unzips the sky and the rain pours. The thunder rolls. A dilophosaur bounds upon him, beautiful, yet painted across his ugly mug is a deadly curiosity as it sniffs the air and cocks it's head at Nedry - moments before spraying his chubby eyes with poison. Blinded, he staggers back to the safety of the jeep, wailing and gnashing teeth, only to discover a visual horror to his right: he's left the passenger-side door ajar - wide enough to let Mr. Curious in for a juicy evening meal - which it savors with a row of sharp teeth .  The point is this: Don't be Dennis Nedry. There are far bigger creatures who'd like nothing better than to split your life  and family  wide open if for no other reason than they can. Such is the nature of the elite .  Unless, of course, you tame them ...  Not bloody likely .   ONE  IS TOR SAFE?  T hat seems to be the question alright. And to that, well, it really depends on whom you ask because there are always wolves in sheep's clothing out there who stand to gain from a man’s ignorance. Many say no. A few will say yes, that it’s ‘safe enough’. The media, for all their expertise in things political and social, come up woefully lacking when something as complex as Tor is discussed and get a lot of things wrong .  Case  in  point.  Gizmodo  reported  that  in  December,  2014,  a  group  of hackers managed to compromise enough Tor relays to de-cloak Tor users. If you're just hearing this for the first time, part of what makes Tor anonymous is that it relays your data from one node to another. It was believed that if they compromised enough of them, then they could track individual users on the Tor network and reveal their real life identities. Kind of like how the agents in The Matrix find those who've been unplugged .  Anyway as luck would have it, it turned out to be kiddie script-hackers with too much time on their hands who simply wanted a new target to hack. Who knows why. Could be that they'd toyed with the Playstation Network and  Xbox  users  long  enough  and  simply  wanted  a  curious  peak  here  and there. These were not superhackers .  But  as  is  usually  the  case  with  the  media,  this  attack  attracted  the attention of a few bloggers and tech journalists unsympathetic to Tor and frankly,  ignorant  of  what  really  constitutes  a  threat.  The  Tor  devs commented on it, too :  "This looks like a regular attempt at a Sybil attack: the attackers have signed  up  many  new  relays  in  hopes  of  becoming  a  large  fraction  of  the network. But even though they are running thousands of new relays, their   relays currently make up less than 1% of the Tor network by capacity. We are  working  now  to  remove  these  relays  from  the  network  before  they become a threat, and we don't expect any anonymity or performance effects based on what we've seen so far ."  What  those  conspiracy  bloggers  failed  to  report  was  that  any decentralized  network  like  Tor  is  a  prime  target  for  attacks  such  as  the above. But to truly stand a chance at punching a hole through this matrix, hackers  would  need  Tor  to  implicitly  trust  every  new  node  that  comes online. That doesn't happen .  It also takes time for fresh relays to gather traffic - some as long as sixty days or more and the likelihood of being reported is rather high since the IP addresses are out in the open - which only speeds up malicious reporting. The real danger, and has been since inception, is scaring Tor users to less secure  methods  of  communication.  That's  what  the  NSA  wants.  The  CIA already does this in foreign countries. Now the NSA is following their lead .   TWO  RISKS OF USING TOR  The REAL Risk of Using Tor  I LIST them here before we dive deep into enemy territory so you'll know what  to  avoid  before  installation,  and  maybe  get  an  "a-ha!"  moment  in subsequent  chapters.  As  you  read,  remember  that  having  Javascript  on  is really only a drop in the ocean next to what is possible for an enemy to kill your anonymity .  Javascript  It's  widely  known  that  leaving  Javascript  on  is  bad  for  a  Tor  user. Ninety-five percent of us know this, but the mistakes of the 5% get blown out of proportion and thrown into the face of the rest of us. Worse, many websites  now  run  so  many  scripts  that  it  seems  as  though  they  hate  Tor users .  One site required over a dozen. Without it, the page was is will be pretty much gimped. Sometimes not even readable . You can imagine what might happen if you were using Tor and decided to visit that site if it was set up to lure users into a honeypot .  I remember one researcher claimed that "81% of Tor users can be de-  anonymised ."  Bull .   That 81% figure came about because the targeted users knew little about the NoScript browser add-on, and likely mixed Tor usage with their daily open net usage, providing ample data for a correlation attack. But that was just the icing on the cake. They left personal details *everywhere* - using the  same  usernames  and  passes  they  do  elsewhere  on  the  open  net. Bragging  about  their  favorite  Netflix  movies.  Talking  about  local  events  Jazzfest in New Orleans! . The weather  Hurricane in the French Quarter! . You get the idea .  Volunteering as an Exit Node  A NOTHER DOOZY, though not quite the granddaddy of all risks, but still risky. On the plus side, you as a valiant believer in anonymity graciously provide bandwidth and an "exit pipe" to the rest of the Tor users  hopefully none  of  whom  you  know   so  that  they  may  pass  their  encrypted  traffic through your node. Generous? Certainly. Wise? If you live in the States... hale no as my Uncle Frick in Texas used to say .  It isn't that it is illegal per se to do so. On the contrary, but what passes through your node can land you in hot water if you live in a police state. All exiting traffic from your node  i.e. other people's traffic   is tied to your IP address and as others have found, you put yourself at risk by what others on the other side of the planet do with your node .  Lots  of  new  Tor  users  fire  up  BitTorrent  configured  for  Tor  and  suck down all the bandwidth. It makes for a very miserable Tor experience for other users. You may get served with a copyright violation notice  or sued , or perhaps raided if child porn flows out of your pipes. Think carefully and do your research before taking on such a risky charge, lest your computer be seized and your reputation ruined .  Running an Exit Relay From Home   R UNNING it from home is even worse then using cloud storage, and is infinitely dangerous in the USA and UK. If the law for whatever reason has an interest in your Tor traffic, your PC might be seized, yes, but that's only the  start.  In  the  UK,  there  is  no  5th  amendment  protection  against  self- incrimination.  A  crusty  old  judge  can  give  you  two  years  just  for  not forking over the encryption keys  which if they had, they would not have bothered raiding at 6AM  .  Use a host instead that supports Tor. There is Sealandhosting.org , for one.  They  accept  Bitcoins  and  do  not  require  any  personal  info,  only  an email. They offer Socks, Dedicated Servers, Tor Hosting and VPS as well as Domains .  We'll get into the nitty details later, but these are the Rules I've set for  myself :  - Refrain from routing normal traffic through it - Never do anything illegal  more later as it's a grey area   - Never put sensitive files on it  financial info, love notes, court docs   - Be as transparent as possible that I'm running an exit  Intelligence Agencies  T HEY'VE DECLARED war on Tor and its stealth capabilities, no doubt about it. And though they will fight tooth and nail to convince you it is for your  own  good,  really  what  it  all  comes  down  to  isn't  so  much  national security  as  it  is  national  control:  Control  over  you  in  that  they  know  not what you're doing on Tor, nor why .  They don't like that . It's quite pompous of them to spend so much money and waste so much time  chasing  you  simply  because  they  don't  like  you  or  your  actions  not being easily identifiable .  As you probably know, it's more costly to go after a high-value target. But they do not know if you are a high-value target or merely low-hanging fruit. As we've seen in the case of bored Harvard students, anyone can get into serious trouble if they go into Tor blind as a bat .  Even Eric Holder has publicly pointed out that Tor users are labeled as "non-US  persons"  until  identified  as  citizens.  It's  beyond  pompous.  It's   criminal and unconstitutional. It sounds as if they view ALL Tor users as high-value targets .  And by the time you are identified as such, they have acquired enough power  to  strip  you  as  well  as  millions  of  other  citizens  of  their  rights  to privacy and protection under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution .  They do this using two methods :  The Quantum and FoxAcid System  H ERE IS the gist of it :  - Both systems depend on secret arrangements made with telcos - Both involve lulling the user into a false sense of security - Neither system can make changes to a LiveCD  Tails   - Both can be defeated by adhering to consistent security habits . Defeating this requires a mindset of diligence. DO NOT procrastinate. Decide ahead of time to avoid risky behavior. We'll get to them all. A good, security  mindset  takes  time  and  effort  and  commitment  to  develop  but should be nurtured from the very beginning, which is why the RISKS are placed up front, ahead of even the installation chapter. Things tend to drag in the middle of a book like this, and are often forgotten .  Speaking  of  risk,  if  you  wonder  what  truly  keeps  me  up  at  night,  it's this: What do other nations tell high-level CEOs and Intelligence agencies  Hong Kong, for instance  ?  If the only thing I can trust is my dusty old 486 in my attic with Ultima 7 still installed atop my 28.8k dialup modem, then it's safe to assume every commercial entity is jeopardized by the NSA. And if that's true, if the NSA has to jump hoops to spy on us, how easy is it to infiltrate American-owned systems overseas with our data on those systems ?  To that, if no corporation can keep their private info under wraps, then eventually the endgame may evolve into a Skynet grid similar to the Soviet- era East West block in which CEOs have to choose east or west. But that's like trying to decide whether you want to be eaten by a grizzly bear or a lion .   So then, you now know the real risks. The main ones, anyway . Every  one  of  these  risks  can  be  minimized  or  outright  defeated  using knowledge that is in this book. The sad part is that most readers will forget roughly 80% of what they read. Those who take action will retain that 80% because they are making what they've read a reality: Making brilliant chess- like countermoves when the NSA threatens your Queen. If you do not take action ,but merely sit there like a frog in a slowly boiling pot of water, not only will you perish but your future generations will as well. Alright then. Enough of the risks. Let's get to it .   THREE  A FOOLPROOF GUIDE  O r As Foolproof As We Can Get It  N OW LET'S answer what Tor is and what it does and what it cannot do . You've no doubt heard it is some kind of hacker's tool, and you'd be right, but only from the perspective that a powerful tool like Tor can be used for just  about  anything.  In  fact  anything  can  be  bought   except  maybe voluptuous  blondes  in  red  dresses   anonymously...  as  long  as  you're cautious about it .  Before  you  knock  Tor,  remember  that  it  is  not  about  buying  drugs  or porn or exotic white tiger cubs. It's about anonymous communication and privacy - with the main function being to grant you anonymity by routing your  browsing  session  from  one  Tor  relay  to  another--masking  your  IP address such that websites cannot know your real location .  This allows you to : - Access blocked websites  Facebook if you are in China   - Access .onion sites that are unreachable via the open internet -  Threaten  the  president  with  a  pie-to-the-face...and  no  Secret  Service  It does all of this by a process called onion routing . Think of it as a multi-point-to-point proxy matrix. Unlike peer to peer applications  like  BitTorrent  or  eMule  which  expose  your  IP  to  everyone, Tor  uses  a  series  of  intermediary  nodes   and  thus,  IPs   that  encrypt  your data all along the network chain. At the endpoint, your data is decrypted by  visit !   an  exit  node  so  that  no  one  can  pinpoint  your  location  or  tell  which  file came  from  which  computer.  Due  to  this  anonymizing  process,  you  are anonymous on account of the packed "onion layers" that hide your true IP address .  It is even possible to build a site such that only Tor users can access it. Also called "Onion Sites," though technically challenging, you don't need a Ph.D in computer science to build one. Or even a Bachelor's degree. These Onion sites are unaccessible by anyone using the regular web and regular, non-Tor Firefox .  We'll delve deeper into that later, as well as construct a fortress of doom  that nothing can penetrate .  Installation  I NSTALLING TOR IS DIRT SIMPLE. You can download it from the Tor website at :  https:  www.torproject.org download download-easy.html.en If your ISP blocks you from the Tor site, do this : -  Shoot  an  email  to  Tor.  Tell  them  the  situation.  You  can  get  an  automated message sent back to you with the Tor installation package .  - Go to Google. Do a search for any cached websites, including Tor, that might have the install package to download. Many tech sites may just have it in the event of all-out nuclear war .  - Visit rt.torproject.org and ask them to mirror it . - Get a friend to email you the Tor installation. Ask for Tails, too . - VERIFY the signature if you obtain it elsewhere other than from the main  Tor  site,  verify  it  even  if  your  friend  hand-delivers  it.  I've  gotten viruses  in  the  past  from  friend's  sharing  what  they  thought  were  "clean" apps .  Now then. Choose Windows, Linux or the Mac version and know that your  default  Firefox  install  will  not  be  overwritten  unless  you  want  it  to. Both use Firefox but Tor is a completely separate deal. You'll notice it has the same functions as Firefox: Tabs. Bookmarks. Search box. Menus. It's all here - except your favorite add-ons .   On that point, you might be tempted to install your favorites. Don't give in to that temptation. Multiple add-ons that do nothing for your anonymity might  assist  someone  in  locating  you  over  Tor  by  what  is  known  as "Browser fingerprinting . "  N OW YOU'VE GOT some choices .  One is to volunteer your bandwidth, which makes it easier for other Tor users  but  comes  with  risk.  More  on  that  later  but  for  now  just  know  that every  page  you  visit  with  the  Tor  Browser  will  be  routed  anonymously through the Tor network .  There  is  however  an  important  detail  you  need  to  know  concerning security,  and  that  is  that  your  Tor  settings  are  merely  reasonable  starting points  .  They  are  not  optimal.  We're  still  at  the  infancy  stage  and  quite frankly,  optimal  as  Tor  knows  optimal  is  largely  dependent  on  hardware  network,  CPU,  RAM,  VM,  VPN ,  and  so  each  person's  setup  will  be different .   FOUR  WHAT TOR CANNOT DO  N ow for what Tor cannot do, or at least cannot do very well. In the future this may change so don't fall on your sword just yet .  1 .  TOR CANNOT PROTECT you from attachments .  T HIS IS NOT LIMITED to executables but anything that can be run by way of code. This means Flash videos as well as RealPlayer and Quicktime, if  you  still  use  it.  Those  babies  can  be  configured  to  send  your  real  IP address  to  an  adversary.  Not  good.  So  never  run  any  executable  or  app unless  you  trust  the  source.  If  at  all  possible,  go  open-source  .  This  also goes for any encryption scheme which you MUST use if you're going to use Tor. It is NOT an option. Some say it is but that's like saying learning Thai is optional if you're going to live in Bangkok. You won't get far that way .  2 .  TOR CANNOT RUN torrents well .  O LD NEWS, right?  Thousands  still  do  this.  Better  safe  than  sorry,  they claim.  The  only  problem  is  they  are  safe  and  everyone  else  is  sorry.  Tor cannot  do  P2P  apps  like  Emule  and  Limewire  without  making  everyone   else's Tor experience miserable. It simply sucks down too much bandwidth. In  addition  to  some  exit  nodes  blocking  such  traffic  by  default,  it's  been proven that an IP address can be found by using torrents over Tor. eMule, too,  uses  UDP  and  since  Tor  supports  TCP  protocol,  you  can  draw  your own conclusions about what that does to your anonymity .  True,  you  may  be  spared  a  copyright  lawsuit  since  the  RIAA  likely won't go through all that trouble in trying to get your IP, but please spare other  Tor  users  the  madness  of  1998  modem  speeds.  A  VPN  is  a  much better choice .  3  .   TOR  CANNOT  CLOAK  your  identity  if  you  are  tossing  your  real email  around  like  Mardi  Gras  beads.  If  you  give  your  true  email  on websites  while  using  Tor,  consider  your  anonymity  compromised.  Your virtual  identity  must  never  match  up  with  your  real-life  identity.  Ever. Those  who  ignore  this  rule  get  hacked,  robbed,  arrested,  or  mauled  by capped gremlins. Much more on this later .   FIVE  TOR APPS & ANTI-FINGERPRINT TOOLS  The Best of the Best  A  few  applications  make  Tor  less  of  a  headache,  but  they  are  not particularly well suited for desktop users unless you're doing some kind of emulation. But with everyone using mobile these days, some of these have benefited  me  in  ways  I  never  thought  possible.  Be  sure  and  read  the comments in the Play Store since updates tend to break things .  Orbot: Proxy with Tor   I T IS a proxy app that runs similar to the desktop app and encrypts your net  traffic  and  protects  you  from  surveillance  and  fortifies  you  against traffic analysis. You can use Orbot with Twitter, DuckDuckGo or any app with  a  proxy  feature.  I've  used  this  for  a  long  time  now  and  have  gotten used to it. Perhaps it is time to try something else .  Invisibox - Privacy Made Easy  J  UST  PLUG  the  InvizBox  into  your  existing  router     modem.  A  new "InvizBox" wifi hotspot will appear. Connect to the new hotspot and follow   the one time configuration set up and you're ready to go. All devices that you  connect  to  the  InvizBox  wifi  will  route  their  traffic  over  the  Tor Network .  T EXTSECURE ENCRYPTS every message on your mobile phone and is simple  to  learn.  Better  still,  in  the  event  you  leave  your  phone  at  Marble Slab   Marble  Flab  to  the  Mrs. ,  rest  assured  your  privacy  is  safe  due  to encryption. It's also open-source. Far too many apps aren't, and thus cannot be peer-reviewed by, well, anyone, unlike some proprietary apps like those offered by SecurStar  i.e. Drivecrypt, Phonecrypt  .  Text Secure  Red Phone  T HIS  APP  SECURES  every  call  with  end-to-end  encryption,  allowing you  privacy  and  peace  of  mind.  It  uses  WiFi  and  offers  neat  upgrades  if both callers have RedPhone installed .  It's  not  for  everyone.  Though  it's  not  as  expensive  as  say,  TrustCall, there  are  convenience  issues  like  lengthy  connection  times  and  dropped calls  ever Skype someone from Manila?  so it's not going to be as quick and dirty as Jason Bourne does it .  But  the  pluses  outweigh  the  minuses.  I  especially  love  the  two-word passphrase  as  a  security  feature:  If  you  fear  Agent  Boris  is  dead  and  has been killed by Agent Doris  who now has his phone , you can request she speak the second passphrase. Simple yet effective .  Google and Tor   W HAT DOES Google think of Tor? Quite honestly I suspect they try not to .  They  probably  don't  hate it  like  the  NSA  does,  but  they  know  that  if every  Google  user  used  Tor  on  a  daily  basis,  much  of  their  ad  targeting system would, shall we say, begin firing blanks . Imagine if a thirteen year old boy received ads for Cialis, or an eighty-year old woman named Bertha began to see ads for Trojan coupons, or... well you get the idea .  They don't mind donating funds, either, since this allows a future stake in the technology  sort of . To that, they've not only donated to Tor, but to Freenet as well and even Mars rover technology. All kinds of crazy things. They never know which technology is going to rocket into orbit a week or year  from  now  so  they  throw  money  around  like  Scrooge  on  Christmas morning .  Captchas  A T TIMES you'll be using Tor and find that Google spits this requirement out  in  order  to  prove  you're  human.  This,  on  account  of  their  massive analyses on search queries, is what drives some Tor users to think Google has it out for them .  However,  Google  has  to  put  up  with  lots  of  spammers  and  general thievery; bots hammering the servers with tons of queries in short amounts of time that put undue strain on the servers can be one thing, but it can also happen  if  your  employer  uses  proxies  -  many  employees  working  for  the same company that uses one of these can set off a red flag .  When  your  Tor  circuit  switches  to  a  new  one,  usually  it  solves  itself.  There are other search engines like DuckDuckGo you can use, however .  You may find websites do the same thing. Again, this is on account of so many exit nodes  all of which are publicly visible to any website admin , slamming  the  website  with  traffic  such  that  the  hammering  behavior resemble those of a bot, the kind Russian and Chinese outfits like to use .  SpiderOak   N ORMALLY I WARN against using Cloud Service for anything you want private.  SpiderOak  one  exception,  with  some  reservation.  It's  a  decent enough alternative to DropBox as it is coded with "Zero Knowledge"  so say  the  developer   and  when  you  install  it,  a  set  of  encryption  keys  is created  client-side.  When  you  upload  data  to  SpiderOak  servers,  they're encrypted  on  *your*  computer  and  *then*  uploaded.  Again,  according  to the developers .  They claim that even if a subpoena requires subscriber data, they could not  deliver  since  only  you  have  the  keys.  Not  bad,  but  I  still  would  not upload anything unencrypted. A container file, for instance .  The  other  downside  is  that  it  is  centralized.  Centralization  means  a single-point-of-failure.  As  well  your  data  can  be  deleted  by  them  at  any time  true with any online service really . Remember that between you and a judge, they will always side with the judge .   SIX  TAILS  E ver heard of a "live system"? Neither had I until Tails burst on the scene. Tails allows you to use Tor and avoid tracking and censorship and in just about any location you could want. It houses its own operating system and is designed for those on the go .  You can run it via USB stick, SD or even a DVD. Pretty handy as this makes it resistant to viruses. It's also beneficial if you don't want your hard drive to leave remnants of your browsing session. The best part is that it's free  and  based  on  Linux  and  comes  with  chat  client,  email,  office,  and browser .  The downside to using a DVD is that you must burn it again each time you  update  Tails.  Not  very  convenient.  So  let's  install  it  to  USB  stick instead .  1.  Download the Tails installer at https:  tails.boum.org install win usb index.en.html You must first install it somewhere, like a DVD , and then clone it the  USB stick or SD card .  .  2.  Click Applications --> Tails --> Tails install to begin the installation  3.  Choose Clone & Install to install to SD card or USB Memory Stick 4.  Plug in your device, then scan for the device in the Target-Device drop down menu. You'll get a warning about it overwriting anything on the device, blah-blah. Choose yes and confirm install .   Tails Limitations  N EITHER TAILS nor Tor encrypt your docs automatically. You must use GnuPG or LUKS for that  included , bearing in mind that some docs like Word or Atlantis may have your registration info within the document itself  In 2013, Amazon self-publishers discovered pen names could sometimes be revealed by looking at the code of the above apps and finding out the real identity of authors. Ouch .   Personally  I  use  fake  info  when  "registering"  any  app  I  will  use  in  conjunction with Tor or Tails .  O THER NOTEWORTHY STUFF :  - Document metadata is not wiped with Tails - Tails does not hide the fact you're using it from your ISP  unless you use Tor bridges . They cannot see what you're doing on Tor, true enough, but they know you're using it .  - Tails is blind to human error. Try not to use the same Tails session to begin two different projects. Use separate sessions. Isolating both identities in this way contributes to strong anonymity for your sessions .  Chrome  F  IREFOX  IS  HARDLY  the  only  way  to  slay  a  dragon.  There's  also Chrome. Yes, it's Google, and yes Google has strayed far from it's "Do No Evil" motto, but like everything else in life, luck favors the prepared. You just have to have the right sword. The right armor. The right lockpicks. The preparations  reagents  are as follows :  I  .  INSTALL  THE  SCRIPTNO  EXTENSION.  It  is  to  chrome  what  a mouse is for a PC, at least as far as precision aiming goes. It offers excellent control,  too,  even  allowing  you  to  fine-tune  the  browser  in  ways  that NoScript for Firefox cannot. If you find it too difficult, ScriptSafe is another   option. I've used both and came away very satisfied, though like everything else on the internet, YMMV .  I I. FlashControl is a nice alternative to Firefox. In the event you don't see it in the Google Play Store, just search for "Flash Block" and it should come up  Google has a habit of removing apps that aren't updated every Thursday under a Full Moon  .  I  II.  Adblock  .  This  one  is  just  insanely  good  at  repelling  all  kinds  of malware .  I V. User-agent Switcher for Chrome. Install it. Never leave home  0.0.0.0  without  it.  It  spoofs  and  mimics  user-agent  strings.  You  can  set  yours  to look  like  Internet  Explorer.  This  will  fool  a  lot  of  malware  payloads  into thinking you really are browsing with IE and not Firefox or Chrome, thus firing blanks at you .  I T  MIGHT  HAVE  SAVED Blake  Benthall,  26  year  old  operator  of  Silk Road  2.0,  from  getting  raided  by  the  FBI   among  a  dozen  other  drug outfits . This was accomplished over the span of many months since they had to get control of many relays, and if you have control of relays , you can use sophisticated traffic analysis to study patterns in IP addresses and match behavior and browser settings with those addresses. Recall that any federal prosecutor will always try to tie an IP address to an actual person where felonies are concerned .  It bears repeating . An IP address is considered an identity for the purposes of prosecution . We're all a number to them, regardless. Those of you with student loans know this perhaps more than anyone else. This will change as time goes on of  course  as  Tor  competitors  like  Freenet  and  other  apps  evolve  to  offer what  Tor  cannot.  Ivan  Pustogarov  said  the  FBI  did  their  homework  and   when all was said and done, had more resources on identifying lazy users than a typical VPN would .  V  .  CANVASBLOCKER  -  And  another  great  plugin  for  Firefox.  This prevents sites from using Javascript   API to fingerprint users. You can block it on every site or be discriminant and block only a few sites. Up to you. The biggest thing for me is that it doesn't break websites. More info here but in case you can't be bothered, here's the gist :  The different block modes are :     - block readout API: All websites not on the white list or black list can use the   API to display something on the page, but the readout API is not allowed to return values to the website .  - fake readout API: Canvas Blocker's default setting, and my favorite! All websites not on the white list or black list can use the   API to display  something  on  the  page,  but  the  readout  API  is  forced  to  return  a new random value each time it is called .  - ask for readout API permission: All websites not on the white list or black list can use the   API to display something on the page, but the user will be asked if the website should be allowed to use the readout API each time it is called .  - block everything: Ignore all lists and block the   API on all  websites .  the   API .  - allow only white list: Only websites in the white list are allowed to use  - ask for permission: If a website is not listed on the white list or black list,  the  user  will  be  asked  if  the  website  should  be  allowed  to  use  the   API each time it is called .  - block only black list: Block the   API only for websites on the  - allow everything: Ignore all lists and allow the   API on all  black list .  websites .  As you can see, it's powerful stuff .   Firefox Armor  B UT FIRST A LITTLE mention of something a lot of people get wrong. You  might  be  tempted  to  enable  "Check  for  counterfeit  websites"  in Firefox. Don't do this as it will relay sites you regularly visit to Google's servers. Google's "predictive text-search" is also bad as it relays keystrokes to Google as well. To change it you have to do it manually by going into about:config in the address bar. That said, let's look at some other privacy settings you might want to know about .  Javascript -  Avoid  like  the  plague.  You  may  notice  it  is  turned  on  by default under the Firefox options tab, though. By the Tor Developer Team : We  configure  NoScript  to  allow  JavaScript  by  default  in  Tor  Browser because many websites will not work with JavaScript disabled. Most users would  give  up  on  Tor  entirely  if  a  website  they  want  to  use  requires JavaScript,  because  they  would  not  know  how  to  allow  a  website  to  use JavaScript  or that enabling JavaScript might make a website work  .  There's a tradeoff here. On the one hand, we should leave JavaScript enabled  by  default  so  websites  work  the  way  users  expect.  On  the  other hand,  we  should  disable  JavaScript  by  default  to  better  protect  against browser vulnerabilities   not just a theoretical concern! . But there's a third issue: websites can easily determine whether you have allowed JavaScript for  them,  and  if  you  disable  JavaScript  by  default  but  then  allow  a  few websites  to  run  scripts   the  way  most  people  use  NoScript ,  then  your choice  of  whitelisted  websites  acts  as  a  sort  of  cookie  that  makes  you recognizable  and distinguishable , thus harming your anonymity .  Ghostery and Ghostrank  N OT DEADLY, just useless on Tor since Tor disables tracking anyway. If you do use it, either could possibly alter your browser 'fingerprint', though not to the extent of breaking anonymity. Ghostery still blocks any tracking scripts regardless if you're on Tor or not. But use DuckDuckGo if you want to beef up your anonymity .   Adblock  T  HIS  COULD  ALSO  CHANGE  your  fingerprint.  Adblock  plus  has "acceptable  ads"  enabled  by  default,  and  there  is  also  the  scandals  that Adblock  has  been  in  over  the  years,  one  implying  that  Google  paid  the Adblock CEO for Google Ads to be shown .  Besides,  the  basic  idea  of  the  Tor  Browser  Bundle  is  to  use  as  few addons  as  possible.  They  figure  that  TorButton,  NoScript,  and  HTTPS Everywhere  is  sufficient  to  preserve  anonymity  without  the  added  risk  of additional addons .  Whonix & Tor  I F YOU'RE paranoid that using Tor could get you into trouble  if you are hosting  a  Hidden  Service ,  you  might  want  to  look  into  Whonix  before running  anything.  Many  power  users  who  use  Tor  daily  like  the  tighter security it offers. This is not to say that it is better than  Tails  by  default. Both tools offer strengths and weaknesses meant for different purposes, and you may find one is better than the other for your personal situation .  Like  Tails,  Whonix  is  built  with  anonymity  and  security  in  mind.  It's also based off of Debian Linux, so it's a good synergy where anonymity is concerned.  This  synergy  grants  anonymity  by  routing  everything  through Tor. The advantages are that DNS leaks are next to impossible and malware cannot  reveal  your  IP  address.  In  fact,  the  only  connections  possible  are routed through Tor via the Whonix-Gateway .  The question you may be wondering is: how much security is too much  security? What's overkill and what isn't ?  Well, you should ask how far will you fall if caught, and how much time are you willing to invest in reading to prevent it. Tails is easier to grasp, and if you do not expect attacks from sites you visit then by all means use Tails . If you live in North Korea or China then there is a possibility of hard labor hammering worthless rocks if they see any Tor activity coming from your location that correlates to "things they don't like" activity... or anything else in the case of NK that offers hope. Guilty until proven innocent .  So if the above applies to you, use Whonix as it offers more security .   A few notable features of Whonix that make it more secure : Anonymous Publishing Anti-Censorship Anonymous E-Mail w Thunderbird or TorBirdy Add proxy behind Tor  user -> Tor -> proxy   Chat anonymously . IP DNS protocol leak protection . Hide that you are using Tor Hide the fact you are using Whonix Mixmaster over Tor Secure And Distributed Time Synchronization Mechanism Security by Isolation Send E-mail anonymously without registration Torify any app Torify Windows Virtual Machine Images  VM   VPN Support Use Adobe Flash anonymously Use Java Javascript anonymously  T HE FOLLOWING IS an example of a moderately secure system :  - Host Whonix on a memory stick with a flavor of Linux of your choice - Use a VPN you trust  for privacy, not anonymity   -  Use  Macchanger  to  spoof  any  mac  address  every  session   Whonix does not hide your mac address from sites you visit! . If Macchanger isn't to your liking, give Technitium MAC Address Changer a try .  - Avoid regular calls of non-Tor WiFi tablets if using Cafe WiFi - Know where every CCTV is located in the area you plan to use Tor  MAC Addresses  W E MENTIONED MAC ADDRESSES .  As  technology  would  have  it,  your  new  WiFi Ethernet  card  has something  that  can  aid  intelligence  agencies  in  tracking  you.  It's  a  48-bit identifier  burned-in  by  the  manufacturer.  Sort  of  like  an  IMEI  for  your   phone.  If  by  chance  you  were  not  thinking  clearly  and  bought  your computer with Tor in mind using a credit card, you may later get targeted by  an  FBI  "NIT"  that  swipes  your  MAC  number.  If  that  happens,  you're toast .  The way to defeat this is to have a disposable MAC  the number, not the Apple product . One that you bought with cash with no security cams. That way you can get rid of it in a flash or swap it out .  They are also soft-configurable . Believe  it  or  not,  Tails  itself  alters  this  randomly  with  every  session. With a virtual machine, the FBI Nit may target a MAC number from the VirtualBox pool. Not really an issue unless they happen to raid your house and snag your system simultaneously. So swapping this out on a daily basis, as you've probably guessed, can be quite a pain. It's mainly for guys who run  illegal  markets.  Guys  who  are  *always*  in  the  crosshairs  of  alphabet agencies .  But then, so can you. I've found it pays to think of oneself higher than what one is actually worth when traversing dark nets. Basically, thinking of yourself as a high value target . You'll subconsciously program yourself to research more, learn more, from everything from bad security mistakes to bad friendships to bad business practices. To that, you don't have to be in the top 5% of guys who've mastered network security. Being in the top 25% pool is more than enough to make The Man get frustrated enough to look for his flashy headlines elsewhere .  I F YOU LIVE in a communist hellscape where even mentioning Tor can get you into trouble, using a Bridge with Whonix can be quite literally a life saver .  Whonix Bridges  What Bridges Are  B RIDGES ARE obfuscation  tools  to  cloak  your  Tor  usage  from  a  nosy ISP  or  government  who  might  see  you  are  using  Tor,  but  not  know  what   you are doing with it. To that end, Tor bridges are alternative ways to enter the Tor network. Some are private. Many are public. Some are listed on the Tor homepage. In a hostile environment you can see the value in using it to your advantage as it makes it much more difficult for an ISP to know you're using Tor .  What Bridges Are Not  W  HILE  NOT  ESPECIALLY  UNRELIABLE  ,  they  are  certainly  *less* reliable  than  regular  Tor  usage  where  performance  goes.  But  the  tradeoff may be in your best interest. Only you can decide if the performance hit is warranted. Here's how to do it in Whonix .  Bridges must be added manually since there is no auto-install method for  Whonix,  but  it  is  not  difficult.  You  simply  must  enter  them  into  the proper directory :  etc tor torrc .  I F YOU'RE USING a graphical Whonix-Gateway, then browse to : Start Menu -> Applications -> Settings ->  etc tor torrc.examples To edit your torrc file  necessary for bridge adding , browse to : Start Menu -> Applications -> Settings ->  etc tor torrc Then add whatever bridge you copied from the Tor bridges page  or a  private one if you have it . Then restart Tor for it to take effect .   SEVEN  TOR AND VPNS  T  here  is  a  lot  of  confusion  among  beginners  when  it  comes  to  VPN companies. They read one thing and see something else in the media that contradicts that one thing. The cold, hard truth about VPN companies is that a few want your patronage so badly that they're likely to bury the fine print on their web page where it is difficult to read. Believe me, that's fine print that can get you sent to the Big House if you're not careful. It really is a minefield where these companies are concerned .  For  this  reason,  you  need  to  decide  whether  you  want  privacy  or anonymity. They are different beasts that require different setups. And not every VPN user uses Tor and not every Tor user uses a VPN service, but it is  advantageous  to  combine  two  powerful  tools;  one  that  affords  privacy  the VPN  and one anonymity  Tor . Like I said, two different beasts .  But  for  what  it's  worth,  if  you  like  this  combo  then  find  a  VPN  that offers 128 bit encryption and that does not store activity logs . That's the first rule of business .  And  here's  the  part  where  the  fine  print  comes  in.  Many  VPN companies  claim  they  do  not  log  a  thing...  but  will  gladly  offer  your subscriber data on a silver platter if a subpoena demands it. Between Big Money and Your Freedom, money always wins. They will not go to jail for you, ever. So do your due diligence and research .  Obviously a VPN service is not anonymous by default. Providers love to  tout  that  it  is,  but  let's  face  it  there  is  nothing  anonymous  about  using someone else's line if you left a money trail leading straight to your front door .   Enter Tor, slayer of gremlins and we-know-what-is-better-for-you nanny staters. Tor makes for an extra and formidable layer of security in that the thieves will have to go an extra step to steal something from you. Thieves come in all flavors, from simple jewel thieves to border guards who want to make  you  as  miserable  as  they  are.  So  it  is  a  good  idea  to  ensure  all  the holes in your Tor installation are updated .  Updated applications are resistant to malware attacks since it takes time to find exploitable holes in the code. But... if you do not update then it does not  matter  which  VPN  you  use  with  Tor  since  your  session  may  be compromised. Here is what you can do :  Option 1  Pay for a VPN anonymously  T HIS MEANS NO CREDIT CARDS. No verified phone calls. No links to you or anyone you know. In fact, leave no money trail to your real name or city or livelihood at all and never connect to the VPN without Tor .  For optimal anonymity, connect to your VPN through Tor using Tails. Even if the VPN logs every session, if you *always* use Tor with Tails, it would take an extremely well-funded adversary to crack that security chain. Without logging, it's even more secure .  But always assume they log .  O PTION 2  Pay for a VPN using a credit card  C ONNECTING with  Tor  when  using  a  card  with  your  name  on  it  does nothing for anonymity. It's fine for privacy, but not for anonymity. This is good if you want to use Pandora in Canada for instance but not if you want   to hire a contract killer to loosen Uncle Frick's lips a bit. Uncle Frick, who is 115 years of age and being tight-lipped on where the sunken treasure is . Ahem,  anyway,  VPN  services  sometimes  get  a  bad  rap  by  anonymity enthusiasts,  but  signing  up  anonymously  for  a  VPN  has  advantages.  It strengthens the anonymity when using Tor, for one .  Even if the VPN keeps logs of every user, they will not know even with a court order the real identity of the user in question. Yet if you used Paypal, Bitcoin, credit cards or any other identifiable payment methods to subscribe to a VPN for the express purpose of using Tor, then anonymity is weakened since these leave a paper trail  Bitcoin by itself is not anonymous  .  But the real down and dirty gutter downside is .onion sites. These are sites that can only be accessed by using Tor. The problem is that the last link  of  connectivity  for  these  sites  needs  to  be  Tor,  not  the  VPN.  You'll understand what is involved once you connect with one which brings up our next question .  How Tor Friendly is the VPN ?  T HAT DEPENDS. Spammers use Tor. Hackers use Tor. Identity thieves use  Tor.  A  few  VPNs  have  reservations  about  letting  users  attain  100% anonymity by signing up anonymously. But if you signed up anonymously then you have little to fear since at that point it is their nose on the line .  There is one problem: the hardliners at the FBI do not like this attitude. In fact, they'd just as soon go after you if you use a VPN over Tor. Might a person come under twice the suspicion by using both? Maybe .  F ROM FEE.ORG  "The  investigative  arm  of  the  Department  of  Justice  is  attempting  to short-circuit  the  legal  checks  of  the  Fourth  Amendment  by  requesting  a change in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. These procedural rules dictate how law enforcement agencies must conduct criminal prosecutions, from investigation to trial. Any deviations from the rules can have serious consequences,  including  dismissal  of  a  case.  The  specific  rule  the  FBI  is targeting outlines the terms for obtaining a search warrant .   I T’S CALLED Federal Rule 41 b , and the requested change would allow law  enforcement  to  obtain  a  warrant  to  search  electronic  data  without providing any specific details as long as the target computer location has been hidden through a technical tool like Tor or a virtual private network. It would also allow nonspecific search warrants where computers have been intentionally damaged  such as through botnets, but also through common malware  and  viruses   and  are  in  five  or  more  separate  federal  judicial districts.  Furthermore,  the  provision  would  allow  investigators  to  seize electronically stored information regardless of whether that information is stored inside or outside the court’s jurisdiction .  The change may sound like a technical tweak, but it is a big leap from  current procedure ."  T HE NSA DOES this without hindrance. We know this from Snowden's leaks  that  the  FBI  uses  the  NSA's  metadata  from  private  citizen's  phone records. Thus, a VPN is not a truly formidable obstacle to them .  But this takes it to an entirely different level since if merely signing up for a VPN provides a basis for a legal search, then they can snoop on any ISP's  server  they  want  with  no  legal  grounds  at  all  to  justify  it.  They've done similar things in Brazil .  But here in America, it usually goes down like this : 1.  Spy on JoBlo to see what he's up to . 2.  Make justification to seize PC Raid Data by reconstructing case 3.  Apply pressure to the right people with direct access to subscriber  4.  Subpoena to decrypt subscriber's data. If they've done it once, they  can do it a hundred more times. No Big Deal .  info  Solution  I  F  YOU'RE  GOING  to  go  the  VPN  route,  then  use  PGP:  Pretty  Good Privacy.  Never,  ever  transmit  plain  data  over  a  VPN,  not  even  one  that   offers SSL .  1.  Talking to police will never help you. Even in a raid situation. They wake you at gunpoint at 6AM and corral your family and threaten to take everyone to jail unless someone confesses. It's all lies, all the time by these agencies. A friend once remarked that a plain-clothes officer once knocked on  his  door  to  ask  him  if  he  was  using  Tor,  only  to  make  sure  he  wasn't doing anything illegal . He answered yes, but nothing illegal sir. That gave incentive to go forward like a giant lawnmower right over his reputation. He was proven innocent later on but not before the cops dragged that man's reputation through the mud. No public apology came  Do they ever ? .  2.  If they don't charge you for running a hidden service, walk out. In fact, if they don't charge you with anything ... walk out. Every word out of your mouth will aid them, not you .  3.  You have no reason to justify anything done in your own home to them, or anywhere else. The responsibility to prove guilt is theirs, not yours .  But,  if  you  are  in  a  situation  where  you  have  to  talk  or  give  up  your encrypted  laptop,  always  always  give  up  your  laptop  first.  Laptops  are cheap and easy to replace. Five years is not .  U SING Bitcoins to Signup Anonymously to a VPN Service  B ITCOINS ARE NOT DESIGNED for absolute anonymity, but neither are VPNs. They're designed for privacy. So why use them ?  Well because any extra layer that strengthens your anonymity is a layer you want. But just as with any advanced tool, you can lessen anonymity if you  are  careless  with  it.  Good,  tight  anonymity  tools  can  be  a  bane  or  a boon:  A  boon  provided  you  do  your  homework.  If  not,  folly  and embarrassment  ensues,  possibly  a  situation  where,  depending  on  the country you're in, you might as well slap the cuffs on yourself. It's sad that the times have come to this predicament .  So let's consider then how one pays for a VPN and obtains this level of absolute anonymity - recognizing that a VPN by itself will do nothing to further this goal. It is only one tool in a toolbox full of tools and Bitcoin is   only one of them as well. You wouldn't try to repair a Camaro engine with only a wrench, would you ?  Now then, back to Bitcoin . Bitcoins are open source coins, a digital currency that utilizes P2P-like code,  and  like  real money  you  can  buy  online  products  with  it.  Products like memory cards at Newegg or even a Usenet or VPN premium service. These are useful to us. Using these Bitcoins, you the end-user, completely bypass  the  need  for  a  credit  union  or  bank.  Pretty  neat.  But,  they're  not without their shortcomings .  For  now  simply  know  that  they  are  created  from  the  collective  CPU computations  of  a  matrix  of  users   like  you,  for  instance   who  donate  to their creation. Bitcoin mining is involved, and though you may have seen images  of  Bitcoins  on  websites  stamped  with  a  golden  "B",  they  are actually not something you can carry around in your pocket .  Not in the way you think at least . They have something in common with PGP - public and private keys - just  like  the  PGP  application,  only  instead  of  verifying  your  identity  like PGP  does,  Bitcoins  verify  your  balance  .  This  is  where  Bitcoin  wallets come in. Again, not a magic bullet but rather one tool at our disposal .  On  that  point,  Bitcoin  Wallets  will  only  get  better  at  strengthening anonymity in the coming years. They will accomplish this by breaking the trail  to  our  real  identities.  Oh,  and  their  development  is  constantly improving .  However  as  we  mentioned  earlier--embarrassment  will  result  if  you neglect to do your homework, for every purchase by a particular wallet can be traced. That's right. If you buy a new video card at Newegg with it, the same  that  holds  your  credit  card  details,  and  then  subscribe  to  a  Usenet service  or  VPN,  guess  what...  you've  now  established  a  trail  to  your  real identity. The FBI or Chinese government will not need baying bloodhounds to sniff you out .  But not if you make only one purchase per wallet . This  means  never  using  it  for  *any*  online  entity  in  which  you've purchased  goods  while  your  real  IP  is  connected.  It  also  means  forgoing Google Plus, Facebook, Skype and all social media outlets with said wallet. Twitter, Wal-Mart, BestBuy and even small mom & pop stores with multi- social media buttons splattered all over their websites--these are enemies of   anonymity whether they know it or not  more likely they don't . They are not our friends anymore than a grenade is your friend after pulling the pin . A  single  individual  might  hold  several  addresses  and  make  only  two purchases  a  year,  but  if  he  cross-contaminates  by  mixing  up   each transaction  is  recorded  in  the  Bitcoin  blockchain ,  then  anonymity  is weakened and in most cases, destroyed by his own making. Not good .  The trick is this: don't create a pattern. A string of purchases create a pattern;  the  exact  sort  of  pattern  Google  and  Amazon  code  into  their algorithms to search and better target you with interest-based ads. Bad for anonymity and that's far from the worse that can happen .  We get around this problem by using Bitcoin mixers  .  These  weaken the  links  between  several  different  Bitcoin  addresses  since  the  history  of that  purchase  is  wiped  by  the  exchange  of  Bitcoins  among  other  Bitcoin users .  I N ORDER TO subscribe to a VPN or buy anything online with Bitcoins, a Bitcoin wallet is required. More than one type is available to us. We'll go through each and list their pros and cons .  Bitcoin Wallets  Desktop Wallet  This is what I use and for good reason: I have absolute control over it not to mention the thought of having to access my money on someone else's web  server  defeats  the  entire  idea  of  anonymity.  I  would  never  store  my encrypted files "in the cloud" and neither should you. At least, not without an insanely secure system .  Think about it. Would you bury your safe in the neighbor's yard with a For  Sale  sign  out  front?  Same  deal.  The  server  could  go  down.  The company  could  go  bankrupt.  Any  person  on  the  other  end  on  the  hosting side can install a keylogger without your knowledge. Nasty buggers, those things.  Desktop  wallets  aren't  perfect,  mind  you,  but  they  are  better  than The Cloud. One downside is that you must backup your Bitcoin wallet, an especially  imperative  task  if  it  contains  a  lot  of  money.  I  do  this  quite   religiously every week, as should you. Apologies if this all sounds like a Sunday sermon, but some of this stuff really must be taken as gospel .  Mobility Travel Wallet  A S THE NAME IMPLIES, you carry this on you to make purchases in the same way you would a credit card. Convenience x 1000 .  There are many types of wallets such as Coinbase and Electrum but I found  Multibit  to  be  very  easy  to  learn.  It  is  available  in  both  Linux  and Windows and offers a pass phrase option. Even the balance sheet looks like a  PGP  interface,  but  yet  is  beginner  friendly  and  open-source,  so  no backdoors. Good for anonymity .  M ULTIBIT WINDOWS INSTALL  N OW  WE  COME to  the  instructions  for  a  clean  install  of  this  work  of wonder .  D OWNLOAD THE INSTALLER .  The possible problems we may run into: On Windows 7 64-bit which is the system of choice outside of Linux these days, it may be that the Java Virtual  Machine   JVM   is  not  correctly  located,  or  "Failed  to  create  a selector"  is  shown  in  the  error  message.  A  solution  is  to  change  the compatibility setting :  Choose  the  compatibility  dialog   right  click-->  icon  -  Properties  -->  Choose: "Run this program in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3  Compatibility    ."  Check the box: "Run this program as an administrator "   Multibit Linux Install  I F YOU'RE a Linux fan  and you should be if anonymity is something you strive for , then download the Linux   Unix installer here :  https:  multibit.org help v0.5 help_installing.html Open a terminal window and create an installer executable with :  C HMOD +X multibit-0.5.18-linux.jar  R UN THE INSTALLER: java -jar multibit-0.5.18-linux.jar  I NSTALL .  T HEREAFTER  YOU  WILL  HAVE  a  shortcut  to  start  MultiBit  in  your "Applications  Other" menu. If you see no MultiBit shortcut, you can run MultiBit manually by doing the following :  Open a terminal window and 'cd' to your installation directory type java -jar multibit-exe.jar  N OW IT IS time to purchase Bitcoins. There are several options but what we  want  to  do  is  execute  an  offline  option;  to  buy  Bitcoins  off  the  grid which cannot be traced. Cash n' carry .  LocalBitcoins look promising as does TradeBitcoin. But as Trade looks  down so let's go with LocalBitcoins .  -  After  you  choose  a  Bitcoin  outfit,  you  must  signup  for  the  site  anonymously  but be aware of the interest charges which vary from one to   another depending on how much you want to deal in. For this transaction, use an email in which you anonymously signed up. That means :  - Tor Browser Tails -  No  Facebook  or  other  Social  Media Search  cookies  present  on  machine  - Only accessed for Tor Bitcoins .  C HOOSE 'PURCHASE' on the seller's page and the amount we wish to buy. Remember, we're not buying a house here, only a VPN to use with Tor. Once funds are transferred out of escrow, you will be notified .  Notice  that  the  trader  you  are  dealing  with  might  be  able  to  see  your financial information, i.e. which bank you use, etc., but you can always opt to meet up in person if you want. This carries a whole other set of risks .  Check to make sure the funds are in your Bitcoin Wallet .  Paying for a VPN to Use with Tor  send .  N  OW  IT  IS  time  to  pay  for  your  VPN  service...  anonymously  .  Let's choose Air VPN at $9 mo and who also accepts Bitcoins for payment .  First : Sign up for the service but do not put any information that you've used on any other site such as usernames or passwords. Also, since we do not need to input any banking info, no money trail will be traced to us. The email we use is a throwaway email  you did use Tor to signup, right ?   Second  :  Give  them  the  wallet  address  for  our  Bitcoin  payment.  Hit  Done ! Like any Usenet service, a VPN service will send confirmation to your email with details you need to use that service. Afterward you can see the details of this payment in your Bitcoin wallet .  As you can see, a Ph.D in Computer Science is not needed for this extra layer of anonymity. The problem with the mass of people on Tor, however, is that they cannot be bothered to do these simple extra steps. That's bad for them.  Good  for  you.  Those  that  wear  extra  armor  are  often  the  ones  left   standing after a long battle. But there is one topic left to discuss, and it's the most important :   EIGHT  REAL IDENTITIES OUTSIDE OF TOR  T his is a big one .  One that I'm guilty of breaking because even anonymity nuts can crack under peer pressure every now and then and do something dumb like use Facebook  over  Tor   my  early  days,  thankfully .  A  question  I  kept  asking back then was this :  What kind of danger is there in using your real name online ? It depends . Law  enforcement  and  prospective  employers  who  mine  your  social media presence for data are often worse than thieves who salivate when you announce on Twitter you'll be out of town for two weeks. Thieves, while unsavory and criminally deviant to be sure, rarely profess to be just. And thieves,  as  stated  before,  come  in  all  shapes  and  sizes.  If  they  take  your private data without asking you first, that's stealing .  Employers can be the worst of the lot, as hypocritical as Harvey Two- Face,  demanding  transparency  in  your  life  but  not  their  own  .  Make  an inflamed  political  post  or  drink  wine  on  vacation  in  Bora  Bora  with Filipinas twirling fire sticks and you could lose your job, or be denied one. Not kidding. Mention you use Tor and you may hear your interviewer ask : "I noticed you're a big fan of Tor. Could you elaborate on why you need  to use an anonymizing service? We like transparency in our employees ."  Yes, I was actually asked this in an interview for a position that handled a lot of money. It came out of nowhere, but what really bothered me was the casual way it was asked, like every applicant should have something to hide if they desire anonymous communications. Maybe I was some rabid fan of Jason Bourne and up to no good. At any rate, they did not like my answer .   "Because I value freedom ." I came out of that interview perplexed, yet jobless, viewing privacy as somewhat of a double-edged sword since one needs an online presence for many  higher  paying  employers.  It  did  not  sit  well  with  me.  I  felt  a  little cheated  to  be  honest  and  as  I  drove  home,  some  of  the  mumblings  I overheard later on became as loud as roaring trains in my ears :  Don't like someone on Facebook? You probably won't like working with  them .  hitmen .  Like  the  competitor's  products?  Here's  our  three-year  non-compete  agreement for you to sign .  You  use  Tor?  The  only  people  that  use  that  are  terrorists,  pedos  and  Soon  thereafter,  any  time  a  prospective  employer  noticed  "Tor"  under the  Hobbies  section  of  my  resume,  it  would  always  illicit  a  negative reaction. My breathing would become erratic as my heart raced, as if they were  about  to  summon  an  unbadged  "authority"  to  warn  me  of  being  too private .  He  would  dress  a  lot  like  Dilbert,  only  he'd  be  skinnier,  and  with  a bumblebee-yellow pen and a clipboard. He'd have multiple facial tics and a quirky  habit  of  raising  a  Vulcan  eyebrow  as  if  it  were  purely  illogical  to value privacy. I have no idea why he'd have a clipboard, but he always did . My  solution  was  to  rightly  divide  my  public  and  private  identity  in social settings and remove any trace of it on my resume. In fact, I did not give any indication on any social media site, either, that I was into any of the following :  - PGP - Encryption, or encrypting files or Operating Systems - Tor Relays - I2P - Freenet - Anonymity in general - Anything linking to Edward Snowden Such is the nature of the masses. One simply cannot rely on Facebook or  Twitter  or  Google  to  respect  one's  freedom  to  use  Tor  without announcing it to the whole world .  But  with  Tor,  Google  cannot  mine  your  browsing  session  for  ads.  No  ads = no soup for them. From NBC :   "The Internet search giant is changing its terms of service starting Nov. 11. Your reviews of restaurants, shops and products, as well as songs and other content bought on the Google Play store could show up in ads that are displayed to your friends, connections and the broader public when they search on Google. The company calls that feature "shared endorsements .'' So I firewall everything I do. I use Ghostery for social sites and offer only  pseudonymous  details  about  myself.  In  fact,  I  try  to  avoid  any correlation between Tor and any social media site just as one would a can of gasoline and a lighted match .  Anonymous Bullies  T HE MEDIA along with Google and Facebook seems to think that if only everyone's name were known to them, then every bully from California to Florida would go up in smoke .  Vampirism, like bullying, comes in many forms, but if you've ever read Anne  Rice  then  you  know  every  clan  is  as  different  as  diamonds  are  to lumps  of  coal.  But  they  do  usually  share  similar  beginnings  .  Take adolescence for example .  Were you ever bullied in school? I was. I remember every buck toothed spiked-club wielding ogre who pelted me into nothing but a wet snowball in 7th  grade,  and  it  didn't  stop  there.  How  I  wished  it  had,  but  not  having Aladdin's lamp made things difficult. I watched as they spread like cancer, sludging upward to other grades for easier victims. Ninth on upward to 12th and  even  into  the  workforce.  Bullies  who'd  make  great  orc  chieftains  if there were any openings, such was their cruelty and ire .  I  recall  one  particularly  nasty  breed  of  ogre  in  8th  grade.  He  was  the worst of the lot. A walking colossus who sweat when he ate as though he were being taken over by something in The Thing. Either that or Mordor. He certainly had the arms for it. When he arced an arm over me it sounded like a double-bladed axe slicing the air in half .  Harassment grew more fierce and fiery every year. Later I would learn that  his  entire  family,  perhaps  his  entire  generation  ,  grew  up  being  the   baddest of the bad - bullies that thrived on terrorizing to make a name for themselves. Every one of them went on to become cops in the New Orleans area. One died of diabetes. Another went on to join the ATF to fight the evil scourge called drugs  how'd that work out ? .  I knew everything about these cretins and not just their names. I knew who their parents were. What they did for a living. Who they hung out with. What beers their dad's drank and with what porn mags. Gossip spread like wildfire  in  high  school  and  no  detail  of  identifying  information  was  ever left out .  And  yes,  I  told  the  principle,  a  great  big  lady  named  Beverly  whose former job was working in some HR high-rise. I remember multiple times meeting  her  in  that  office  where  glitzy  awards  hung  like  a  safari  hunter's office and thinking if only she had an elephant gun I could borrow. Boom! My trouble's be over  so thought the 13 year old  .  Meetings between my circus acrobat mother became fruitless and rather embarrassing. Absolutely nothing positive came of it. The point, however, isn't  that  nothing  came  of  it,  but  that  nothing  came  of  it  even  as  I  knew everything  about  the  scourge  I  faced  daily.  Knowing  their  identities  did, well,  not  much  of  anything.  Knowing  their  names  did  nothing.  Knowing how many other kids they tormented did nothing and, let's face it, kids just aren't smart enough to band together and attack no matter how many times we watched Road Warrior .  We  can  see  how  bullying  spreads  on  Facebook.  Like  anthrax.  Little wolves ostracize a rejected member when a drop of fear is shown, so they crucify  without  knowing  much  of  anything  about  him  or  why  he's  being targeted. Real names? Check. Real addresses? Yep. Everything is traceable now just as it was way back then. And still the orcs come in a blood-toothed frenzy like sharks to a wounded dolphin .  When  13  year  olds  begin  hanging  themselves  in  mom's  bedroom  to escape the torture, one thing is immediately obvious: what they really want is to disappear . They want anonymity .  But  that's  not  something  bullies  think  highly  of.  They  won't  allow  it. Neither do they allow running away, not that a kid has the means anyway: No money. No car. No distant relatives in Alaska to run and live with and hunt moose all winter .  Anonymity is not an option. It's a requirement. It should be the law on some level but isn't. This is because if they gave us true anonymity, they   would lose the precious power they wield over us. If Google and Facebook ever  teamed  up  with  the  federal  government  to  require  ID  to  access  the internet, we'd all be better off going face-to-face with an Alaskan grizzly .  Email Anonymity  T HERE WAS a time when we didn't have to worry about what we said in emails.  Security?  That  was  something  geeks  did.  Geeks  and  supergeeks who attended hacker conventions and scoured Usenet for zero-day exploits. It was the days of Altavista and Infoseek, when Google was still wet behind the ears and Microsoft was still struggling to satisfy every Dos user's whim. We wrote whatever we wanted and hit send with nary a worry about third parties intercepting it and using our own words against us. Sadly, no longer .  Advertising and search engines now tailor advertisements to individuals based on what you like and are sure to click. Trails are left. Messages are scanned. And Gmail is no different than Yahoo or Microsoft. In fact, judges wield  more  power  with  the  pen  than  any  CEO  in  any  company  in  North America .  When  a  trailer  is  leaked  or  someone  says  something  nasty  about  the government,  you  can  bet  IP  addresses  will  be  subpoenaed.  Sometimes  I imagine a lot of ex-Soviet officers are laughing at how many snitches the Internet produces on a yearly basis. Subversion to the extreme .  But is it possible to send a message that is foolproof against subpoenas ? There are, in fact, many flavors to choose from to accomplish this task. Below are a few rock-solid services. Combined with Tor, they grant you a virtual fortress. Anonymity squared if your message is encrypted .  The first is TorGuard . TorGuard  allows  users  to  use  PGP   Pretty  Good  Privacy   in  email  so you  needn't  worry  about  snooping.  You  get  10MB  plus  several  layers  of protection with mobility support .  S ECOND IS W3, The Anonymous Remailer   Connectable  with  Tor,  you  only  need  an  email  address  to  send  the  message to  preferably encrypted with PGP--more on that in a moment  .  Another is Guerrilla Mail . They allow users to create throwaway emails to be used at leisure. Emails sent are immediately wiped from the system after you hit Send. Well, within one hour at any rate .  A LL OF THESE services claims of anonymity would be pretty thin if we did not encrypt our messages-- which brings us to PGP .  PGP is the encryption standard of choice for many old users like myself, and for good reason. It has never been cracked by the NSA or FBI or any intelligence  agency  and  likely  won't  until  quantum  computers  become common. It works by way of key pairs, one which is public and one private  the one you will use to decrypt your messages with  .  Worry not about the term "keys". It is not difficult to grasp and will be  as easy as hitting send once you've done it a few times .  The first thing you must do is make your public key available. This is only  used  to  verify  your  identity  and  is  not  the  same  as  divulging  your passphrase for say, a Drivecrypt container. Your recipient must also share with you their key so you can respond in turn .  The good news ? Only  the  two  of  you  will  be  able  to  read  each  other's  messages.  The caveat is if the other person is compromised and you don't know about it. They will read everything you encrypt. Here is what you need to know :  1.  To begin, make two keys, one public--for everyone else but you--and one that you wouldn't even share with your own mother. You should back this key up in a secure medium, and remember that if it isn't backed up to three  different  types  of  media,  it  isn't  backed  up.  If  your  truly  paranoid, send one on an encrypted microSD to your parents in case of housefire. Yes, it does happen .  2 .  IF HOWEVER YOU opt to tell mom, then she will need your public key  you did publish it on a public key server , right?  Then you can read it by way of your private key. She doesn't know this key  thank the gods !    3 .  YOU CAN "SIGN" any message you want over Tor or anywhere else  Freenet,  for  example,  the  highest  security  setting  of  which  demands absolute trust of your friend's darknet connection  to verify it is really you sending it .  U NLESS NORMAN BATES does a shower scene on you and takes your keys. Your mom can then verify with your public key that it is really you .  4 .  USERS you've messaged with  or not  can sign your public key as a way of verifying your identity. As you can see, the more people that do this, that is, vouch for you , the better .  Important  U NLESS YOU'VE GOT the photographic memory of Dustin Hoffman in Rainman, it's a good idea to store your public private keys and passwords and also revocation-certificate to backup media so you can retrieve it five years down the line... should you need it. And believe me, you will !  Encrypt them in containers. Always print your key-file or pass phrase and deposit in a safe place. If you lose it, all documents encrypted with it are  permanently  lost.  There  are  no  back-doors  and  no  way  to  decrypt without it. Also, consider making an expiration date at key-pair creation .  If  you  like  nice  and  easy  interfaces,  try  Mymail-Crypt  for  Google's Gmail. It is a plugin that allows users to use PGP-encrypted messages in a handy interface, though ensure your browser is air-tight secure and you trust it with your private key .  One More Thing  R ATHER THAN HAVING to  encrypt  files  and  upload  them  somewhere unsafe,  look  at  AxCrypt  encryption  tool.  This  is  useful  if  you're  used  to   uploading to Dropbox or Google Drive. Just remember that in the event you upload  an  encrypted  file  to  "The  Cloud,"  you  will  not  know  it  if  your password to said file has been compromised without setting strict security rules .  With that said, let's configure PGP for Windows - Install Gpg4Win - Next, create your key in Kleopatra and choose Export-Certificate-to- Server  by  right  click  so  you  can  publish  it  to  a  keyserver.  Get  a  trusted friend to "sign" and establish trust .  - Use Claws-Mail client that comes packaged with it or use Enigmail if  - Send a few messages back and forth to your trusted friend via PGP to  you're using Thunderbird .  get the hang of things .  - Optionally you can set a Yahoo Gmail Hotmail filter so as to forward any messages that contain "Begin PGP message" to a more private account .  Tor Instant Messaging Bundle  I  T  IS  no  secret  that  the  NSA  has  Skype,  Yahoo  Chat  and  other  instant message services in their hands, but as long as the Tor development team knows about it, they can do something about it .  Enter Tor Instant Messaging Bundle . True  anonymity  is  the  goal  of  this  application.  It  is  built  by  the  very same who developed the Tor browser bundle and like that application, will route  all  communication  through  Tor  relays...  encrypted  backwards  and forwards and hidden from the NSA's prying eyes .  There is also Torchat . Torchat,  like  Yahoo's  IM,  offers  encrypted  chat  and  even  file-sharing. Since it is built upon Tor, you are assured absolute privacy on what you say and to whom you say it. Both Windows and Mac versions are available and no  install  is  necessary.  Just  unzip  anywhere  and  run   preferably  from  an encrypted hard drive or USB-Drive  the blue earth symbol titled 'Torchat '.  A few more useful apps : ChatSecure  -  ChatSecure  is  mainly  used  for  encrypted  messaging  on mobility devices but they offer PC, Linux and Mac versions as well. From   their website :  T  HE  GUARDIAN  PROJECT  creates  easy  to  use  secure  apps,  open- source software libraries, and customized mobile devices that can be used around  the  world  by  any  person  looking  to  protect  their  communications and personal data from unjust intrusion, interception and monitoring .  Whether your are an average citizen looking to affirm your rights or an activist, journalist or humanitarian organization looking to safeguard your work in this age of perilous global communication, we can help address the threats you face .  T ELEGRAM -  THIS  APP also  focuses  on  messaging  but  with  superior speed and is similar to SMS and allows for picture video sending. There are also 'Secret Chats' that offer encrypted sessions. They claim no data is kept on  their  servers  and  you  can  even  set  the  app  to  permanently  delete  all messages .  CryptoCat - Billed as an alternative to social media chat apps like those seen  on  Facebook,  Twitter  and  the  like,  CryptoCat  gives  you  encrypted communications using the AES encryption standard. All encrypted info is deleted after an hour of inactivity .  Freenet -  This  is  the  granddaddy  of  all  anonymous  systems  the  world over, both for file sharing or any kind of secret chats. Explaining everything it has to offer goes far beyond our Tor discussion as they are two different systems, but I include it here as an alternative if you find Tor lacking .  And it is not as simple as Tor, nor is it as fast unless you leave it running 24 7. It is not for everyone as there are all manner of criminal entities that use it and you will notice this if you load up any groups. It is hard to ignore and unlike Usenet, there is no one to file a complaint with. No one to report. It is anarchy multiplied many times over in many groups, but there are ways of mitigating the damage .  But for absolute  anonymity  and  freedom  of  speech,  there  is  no  better  tool to use if you have the patience to learn its darknet offerings .   F ROM THE WEBSITE :  Freenet is free software which lets you anonymously share files, browse and publish "freesites"  web sites accessible only through Freenet  and chat on forums, without fear of censorship. Freenet is decentralised to make it less vulnerable to attack, and if used in "darknet" mode, where users only connect to their friends, is very difficult to detect .  Communications  by  Freenet  nodes  are  encrypted  and  are  routed through  other  nodes  to  make  it  extremely  difficult  to  determine  who  is requesting the information and what its content is .  Users contribute to the network by giving bandwidth and a portion of their  hard  drive   called  the  "data  store"   for  storing  files.  Files  are automatically kept or deleted depending on how popular they are, with the least  popular  being  discarded  to  make  way  for  newer  or  more  popular content.  Files  are  encrypted,  so  generally  the  user  cannot  easily  discover what is in his datastore, and hopefully can't be held accountable for it. Chat forums,  websites,  and  search  functionality,  are  all  built  on  top  of  this distributed data store .  An important recent development, which very few other networks have, is the "darknet": By only connecting to people they trust, users can greatly reduce their vulnerability, and yet still connect to a global network through their friends' friends' friends and so on. This enables people to use Freenet even  in  places  where  Freenet  may  be  illegal,  makes  it  very  difficult  for governments to block it, and does not rely on tunneling to the "free world ". It is not as simple as using a Usenet provider's newsgroup reader. No sir, Freenet  requires  patience.  Using  Frost  or  Fuqid   Front  End  apps  for  the main Freenet program , it might be half an hour before you can "subscribe" to groups or download in the way you can Usenet. Some groups, like the Freenet group and other technical groups will be immediately available, but with few messages. Time will solve this. So keep it running in the closet and  forget  about  it  for  a  day  or  so  if  you  plan  on  subscribing  to  a  lot  of groups .  It will be worth the wait .  Frost & Fuqid   T HE TWO FREE front ends I recommend are: Frost and Fuqid .  Frost has seen a lot of improvements but I recommend you try Fuqid first  as  it  is  the  first  external  app  for  Freenet  that  acts  as  as  an insert download  manager  for  files.  Fuqid  stands  for:  Freenet  Utility  for Queued Inserts and Downloads and runs on Windows or Linux under wine .  The Fuqid freesite is on Freenet itself at : USK@LESBxzEDERhGWQHl1t1av7CvZY9SZKGbCnsD7txqX0I,nP  0CHuKvlbVzcrnz79TEd22E56IbKj-KHB- W8HHi9dM,AQACAAE Fuqid -1    You will need to paste the above into Freenet's front control panel where it says "Key". It can take several minutes to load if you're new to the system .  After  you've  installed  it,  right  click  on  the  left  side  with  your  list  of boards and choose "Add new board". For the name put in "fuqid-announce" with out the quotes. You will now find a new board called "fuqid-announce" in your list of boards .  Right click this board and choose "Configure selected board". This will bring up a new window. On that window click "Secure board" to change it from a public board. Now in the section that says "Public key" paste in the key below :  SSK@qoY-  E5SKRu66pmKH64xa~R~w3hXmS5ZNtqnpEGoCVww,HTVcdWChaaebf RAublHSxBSRaRFG91qCwsa3mGF3-QE,AQACAAE  Now  you  have  the  announce  board  for  Fuqid  added  to  your  Frost boards. The latest releases of Fuqid will be posted to this board along with the fuqid board on FMS. Questions? Direct them to the Frost or FMS board called Fuqid .  Passwords  G OOD, strong passwords are like having a couple of Rottweilers sleeping in  your  den.  Most  intruders  will  leave  when  the  chaos  starts.  Weak passwords are like having a Golden Retriever. Nice and friendly and easy to trust  around  kids,  but  might  just  let  out  a  little  woof  at  3AM  when  said   intruder comes. Then he will hide under the coffee table  the dog, not the intruder  .  I've heard for years that you should never use anything personal as your password. That includes family names. Favorite books. Movies. So what's the solution ?  Remix  your  passwords  with  a  symbol  or  two.  If  you  think  a  hacker won't  be  able  to  guess  the  name  of  your  girlfriend's  locker  combination, you'd  be  mistaken.  It  is  dirt  simple  to  guess  even  if  you  mix  it  up  a  bit. Computers  devoted  to  this  practice  can  guess  many  in  less  than  a nanosecond .  B UT HOW DO you remember a password for a site used over Tor that has symbols ?  Easy. Use a passphrase that is simple to recall for you only. First write out  the  first  letter  of  each  word,  taking  not  of  case  and  position.  Insert symbols therein. For instance :  L AST SUNDAY, the wife bought me a Rolex watch and it was too ugly. Which when changed is :  LS,twbmarwaiw2u The  above  pass  is  hard  for  a  hacker  to  guess  but  easy  for  you  to  remember... assuming you are good at substitution .  Changing Your Passwords  P ROVIDED you've followed the above to the letter, you shouldn't have to rotate out your passwords every 90 days. I'm sure you've heard from both sides of the aisle their say on the subject, but I believe research has proven that keeping a strong password  unless proof of compromise  is a safe bet .   T  HE  RESEARCH  PAPER  FROM  ACM CCS  2010:  "The  Security  of Modern  Password  Expiration:  An  Algorithmic  Framework  and  Empirical Analysis" by Yinqian Zhang, Fabian Monrose and Michael Reiter came to the conclusion that changing passwords every few months did not, repeat, did NOT increase security :  at  least  41%  of  passwords  can  be  broken  offline  from  previous passwords  for  the  same  accounts  in  a  matter  of  seconds,  and  five  online password guesses in expectation suffices to break 17% of accounts .  ...our  evidence  suggests  it  may  be  appropriate  to  do  away  with password  expiration  altogether,  perhaps  as  a  concession  while  requiring users  to  invest  the  effort  to  select  a  significantly  stronger  password  than they would otherwise  e.g., a much longer passphrase  . ....  In  the  longer  term,  we  believe  our  study  supports  the  conclusion  that  simple password-based authentication should be abandoned outright .  Storing Passwords in Tor Browser  Y OU  MAY  HAVE  NOTICED  that  the  "Remember  Password"  option  in Tor Browser is not available, or so it seems. But if you look at the privacy setting and alter the history setting to "remember history" and "remember passwords for sites," it will no longer be greyed out .  Diceware  I  F  YOU  MUST  STORE  PASSWORDS,  a  good  option  for  a  unique random  one  is  Diceware  -  where  you  can  get  an  expire  date  for  any password months from the date of creation. You can copy any password to a text  file  then  encrypt  it  and  mail  it  to  yourself  or  place  on  a  removable  encrypted  drive or USB stick .  Remember : Tor does nothing to improve the security of your *system* to  everyday  attacks.  It  only  improves  security  online,  and  even  then  only when  used  responsibly.  Tor  has  no  idea  if  your  version  of  Windows  is unpatched  and  infected  with  a  zero-day  malware  payload  that  infected  it with a keylogger .   One  way  in  which  a  hacker  could  guess  your  complex  password  is  if they  linked  your  Tor  usage  with  non-Tor  usage  and  compromised  your passwords from a non-Tor site. This is why you should never use the same usernames passwords for Tor that you do for non-Tor activity .  P REVENTING Non-Tor Activity From Being Linked with Tor Activity  I  T  IS  risky  to  browse  different  websites  simultaneously  and  preserve anonymity since Tor might end up sending requests for each site over the same circuit, and the exit node may see the correlation .  It  is  better  to  browse  one  site  at  a  time  and  thereafter,  choose  "New Identity"  from  the  Tor  button.  Any  previous  circuits  are  not  used  for  the new session .  Further,  if  you  want  to  isolate  two  different  apps   allow  actions executed by one app to be isolated from actions of another , you can allow them to use the same SOCKS port but change the user pass .  Another option is to set an "isolation flag" for the SOCKS port. The Tor manual has suggestions for this but it will lead to lower performance over Tor. Personally I like to use Whonix. Two instances, two VMs. One of them runs Tor and the other with Tor Firefox .  Keyloggers  Y OU MIGHT WONDER what a keylogger has to do with Tor. Or for that matter,  what  a  keylogger  even  is.  You're  not  alone.  In  fact  you'd  be surprised  how  many  people  don't  know  and  shocked  how  many  techs consider them a non-issue .  In 2010 I caught up with an old childhood friend of mine I had not seen in over a decade. He was now an ATF agent. I was surprised and  falsely  assumed his extensive training meant he knew as much as an NSA agent when it came to computer security. Wrongo .  He replied to a post I made on a Facebook regarding the hacking group  "Anonymous ."   "What's a keylogger?" he asked. I waited for someone else to reply. No one did so I told him. He seemed amazed, dumbfounded, as though it were something only recently unleashed upon the net. I then told him that they had been around a long time .  But   sigh ,  there's  a  lot  of  confusion  on  what  they  do  exactly.  Some people call them spyware. Others say they're trojans. Still others, exploits. They're a little bit of everything to be honest .  They are surveillance software that tracks and records every click you make, every website visited, every keystroke typed. Chats, Skype, Emails. If you can type it, it can record it and all right under your very nose. It can even email what you type to a recipient on the other side of the world. CC numbers, passwords and Paypal login details are just the short list of targets it can acquire .  So how does one get in infected ? - Opening an email attachment - Running an .exe file from a P2P network from an untrusted user - Accessing an infected website with an outdated browser - The NSA, if they can grease the right palms Some  employers  use  them  to  track  productivity  of  employees.  Some wives attach one via USB  Hardware version  to see who their hubbies are conversing with at night after bed. Parents use them on the kid's computer. So it isn't like they're 100% malicious all the time .  But  they  are  devilishly  difficult  to  detect.  They  wield  an  almost vampiric presence, but like vampires there are subtle signs you can glean without whipping out a wooden stake .  Vampire Signs  - S LUGGISH BROWSING SPEED  - Laggy mouse pausing keystrokes in a text doc - Letters don't match on display with what you type - Errors on multiple webpages when loading heavy text graphics There are two types: software and hardware .   Software Keyloggers  T HIS TYPE HIDES inside your operating system. They lurrrve Windows. Linux, not so much. The keylogger records keystrokes and sends them to a hacker or other mischief maker at set times provided the computer is online. Cloaked,  most  users  will  never  see  it  working  its  dark  art.  Many  popular anti-virus vendors have trouble identifying it because the definitions change so frequently .  Hardware Keyloggers  B  OND  MIGHT  HAVE  USED  one  of  these.  Being  hardware,  it  is  a physical extension that can plug into any USB on a PC and can be bought online  by  suspecting  spouses  or  kids  wanting  access  to  their  dad's  porn stash. Keystrokes are logged to ram memory. No install needed .  Thus, unless you're the type to check your PC innards every day, you might  not  spot  it  until  it's  too  late.  They  also  can  be  built  right  into  the keyboard.  The  FBI  loves  swapping  the  target's  out  with  a  carbon  copy custom-built  surveillance  device.  Granted,  this  is  mainly  for  high-value targets like the Mafia but they're available to anyone .  Keylogger Prevention  - C HECK YOUR KEYBOARD for suspicious attachments. If you are an employee  at  X  company  and  a  new  keyboard  arrives  at  your  desk  one morning, exercise caution unless you trust your boss 200 %. - Use a Virtual Keyboard. No keystrokes = no logging ! - Use Guarded ID to prevent hackers from capturing your keystrokes. It works  by  scrambling  everything  you  type,  rendering  any  info  useless  to   hackers .  - Use a decent firewall to stop a keylogger from delivering your data. A year  ago,  my  Comodo  firewall  alerted  me  to  suspicious  network  activity seemingly out of nowhere when I wasn't doing anything online. Turns out I had  the  Win64 Alureon  trojan.  I  had  to  use  Malwarebytes  to  detect  and remove it. Norton was useless !   NINE  DARKNET MARKETS  J ust how safe is  a  Darknet  in  light  of  the  vulnerabilities  discussed?  The short answer is, as safe as you make it .  You are the weak link. The last link in the security chain. And although you need Tor to access Onion sites, the term can apply to any anonymous network  -  networks  like  I2P  or  Freenet  or  anything  else  that  cloaks  the source of data transmit, and by extension, your identity .  Which brings us to the Darknet Marketplace . The complete list of such marketplaces on the deep web are numerous, and the risk of getting scammed is quite high. It's one reason why you may not have heard about them. They are often taken down quickly by either a venomous  reputation  or  a  law  enforcement  bust.  Sometimes  they  piss  off the wrong people and then spammers ddos the site. But there are numerous places one can go if you're curious about what is sold by whom .  When  I  say  sold  ,  what  I  mean  is,  anything  you  want  that  cannot  be gained through the usual legal channels. And remember that what is legal in one country may be illegal in another. In Canada, lolicon comics are illegal and can get you in big trouble if you cross the border. But not in America. In  the  USA  you  can  pretty  much  write  any  story  you  want.  In  Canada? TEXT stories involving minors are verboten .  The  other  difference  is  that  there  are  safety  nets  in  buying  almost anything in a first world country on the open market. Think BestBuy. Mom and  Pop  stores.  Florist  shops.  If  customers  get  injured,  what  happens? Customers sue via the legal safety net and make a lot of lawyers a lot of money .   But  the  Darknet  Marketplace  laughs  at  any  such  safety  nets.  In  fact, you're likely to get scammed at least a few times before finding a reputable dealer for whatever goods you seek. And it really doesn't matter what it is, either - Teleportation devices? Pets? Exotic trees? It's all the same that goes around. Whatever is in demand will attract unsavory types and not just on the buyer's end .  Therefore, research any darknet market with Tor, being careful to visit forums and check updated information to see if any sites have been flagged as suspicious or compromised. Some other advice :  - Always use PGP to communicate . - Never store crypto-currency at any such marketplace . -  Assume  a  den  of  thieves  unless  proven  otherwise  by  *them*.  The responsibility  is  theirs  just  as  it  is  offline,  to  prove  they  are  an  honest business.  If  you  open  your  own,  keep  this  in  mind:  customers  owe  you nothing. You can only betray them once .  Now for some examples of Phishers and Scammers and other Con men.  By their fruits, ye shall know them .  1  .   SILK  ROAD  2.0   E5WVYMNX6BX5EUVY...   Lots  of  scams  with this  one.  Much  like  Facebook  and  Google  emails,  you  can  tell  a  fake sometimes by the address. Paste the first few letters into a shortcut next to the name. If it doesn't match, steer clear .  2.  Green Notes Counter  67yjqewxrd2ewbtp ...  They promised counterfeit money to their customers but refuse escrow.  A dead giveaway .  3 .  IPHONES FOR HALF OFF :  iphoneavzhwkqmap ...   Now  here  is  a  prime  example  of  a  scam.  Any  website  which  sells electronic  gadgets  on  the  deep  web  is  ripe  for  scamming  customers. Whereas in the Far East you will merely get counterfeit phones with cheap, Chinese made parts that break within a month, on the Deep Web they will simply  take  your  money  and  say  adios.  Actually,  they  won't  even  bother saying that .  So then, how does one tell a scam ?   Because many new darknet vendors will arise out of thin air, with rare products that will make customers swoon and send them money - without doing  any  research  on  their  name  or  previous  sales.  A  real  hit  and  run operation. Hit quick and fast and dirty. Seduce as many as they can before the  herd  catches  on  to  the  wolf  in  disguise.  Many  are  suckered,  thinking "it's only a little money, but a little money from a lot of Tor users goes a long way in encouraging other scammers to set up shop .  When you ask them why they do not offer escrow, they say "We think it is unreliable suspicious unstable" amid other BS excuses. It is better to hold on to your small change than leave a trail to your treasure chest. And make no  mistake  some  of  these  scammers  are  like  bloodhounds  where  identity theft is concerned .  Do  your  research!  Check  forums  and  especially  the  dates  of  reviews they have. Do you notice patterns? Are good reviews scattered over a long period of time or is it rather all of a sudden--the way some Amazon affiliate marketers  do  with  paid  reviews  that  glow?  Not  many  reviews  from  said customers ?  If  you've  seen  the  movie  "Heat,"  with  Al  Pacino  and  Robert  de  Niro, you know when it is time to Walk Away. In the middle of a nighttime heist, Niro goes outside for a smoke. He hears a distant cough. Somewhere. Now, this is middle of the night in an unpopulated part of the city that comes from across the street - a parking lot full of what he thought were empty trailers. Hmm, he thinks maybe this isn’t such a great night for a hot score. Not so empty  it was a cop in a trailer full of other hotshot cops . He walks back into the bank and tells his partner to abort .  The other aspect is time. Some fake sites will set a short ship time and count  on  you  not  bothering  to  see  the  sale  as  finalized  before  you  can whistle Dixie out of your ass. After finalization, you're screwed since the money is in their wallet before you can even mount a protest .  Fraud Prevention  O NE IS Google believe it or not, at http:  www.google.com imghp .   Dating  sites  like  Cherry  Blossoms  and  Cupid  sometimes  use  reverse image search to catch fakers and Nigerian scammers masquerading as poor lonely singles to deprive men of their coinage. If they can catch them, so can you. If the image belongs to some other legit site, chances are it is fake. Foto Forensics also does the same, and reports metadata so that it becomes even harder to get away with Photoshop trickery .  When it is Okay to FE  Finalize Early    F E MEANS 'FINALIZE EARLY'. It's use online can usually be found in black  marketplaces  like  Silk  Road  and  Sheep's  Marketplace.  It  simply means that money in escrow is released before you receive your product. Every customer I've ever spoken with advises against this unless you've had great experience with that business .  But... quite a few vendors are now making it a standard practice to pay  funds up front before you have anything in your hands .  On more than one Marketplace forum, there's been heated exchange as to when this is proper. You might hear, "Is this guy legit? What about this Chinese outfit over here? He seems shady," and others: "A friend said this guy is okay but then I got ripped off!". You get the idea .  Here is my experience on the matter . 1.  It is okay when you are content with not getting what you paid for. This may seem counterproductive, but think how many gamblers go into a Las Vegas casino and never ask themselves "How much can I afford to lose ?"  The  answer,  sadly,  is  not  many.  Vegas  was  not  built  on  the  backs  of losers. Some merchants do not like escrow at all. Some do. So don't spend more  than  you  can  afford  to  lose.  Look  at  it  the  way  a  gambler  looks  at making money .  2.   It  is  okay  when  you  are  guaranteed  shipment.  There  are  FE scammers  out  there  that  will  give  you  an  angelic  smile  and  lie  right  into your eyes as they swindle you. Do not depend solely on reviews. A guy on SR can be the best merchant this side of Tatooine and yet you will wake up one  day  and  find  yourself  robbed.  He's  split  with  a  million  in  BTC  and   you're left not even holding a bag. Most won't do this to you. But a few will .  When it is NOT Okay to FE  W  HEN  LOSING  your  funds  will  result  in  you  being  evicted  or  a relationship severed. Never borrow money from friends and especially not family unless you want said family to come after you with a double-bladed ax.  If  you  get  ripped  off,  you  lose  not  only  the  cash  but  the  respect  and trustworthiness  of  your  family.  Word  spreads.  You  don't  pay  your  debts. What's that saying in Game of Thrones ?  Right. A Lannister always pays his debts. So should you .  MultiSigna  S  OUNDS  LIKE  SOMETHING  from  Battlestar  Galactica  to  pass  from ship to ship. A badge of honor perhaps some hotshot flyboy wears on his fighter jacket that bypassed a lot of red tape .  While  not  exactly  mandatory,  it  makes  for  interesting  reading,  and  is something  Tor  users  might  want  to  know  about  if  they  wish  to  make purchases anonymously. Here's what happens :  When  a  purchase  is  enacted,  the  seller  deposits  money   in  this  case, Bitcoins   in  a  multi-signature  address.  After  this,  the  customer  gets notification to make the transaction  $,€  to the seller's account .  Then  after  the  seller  relays  to  MultiSigna  that  the  transaction  was  a success, MultiSigna creates a transaction from the multi-signature address that requires both buyer and seller so that it may be sent to the network. The buyer gets the Bitcoins and ends the sale. Confused yet? I was too at first. You'll get used to it .  Critical   M  ULTISIGNA  ONLY  EXISTS  AS  A  VERIFIER COSIGNER  of  the entire  transaction.  If  there  is  disagreement  between  seller  and  buyer,  no exchange occurs. Remember the scene in Wargames when two nuclear silo operators have to turn their keys simultaneously in order to launch? Yeah, that .  MultiSigna  will  of  course  favor  one  or  the  other,  but  not  both  if  they cannot mutually agree. The upside is that is if the market or purchaser or vendor loses a key, two out of three is still available. A single key cannot spend the money in 2 3 MultiSig address .  Is it Safe? Is it Secret ?  I  don't  recommend  enacting  a  million  dollar  exchange  for  a  yacht,  or even a thousand dollar one as they both carry risk, but ultimately it is up to you.  Just  remember  that  trust  is  always  an  issue  on  darknets,  and  you're generally safer making several transfers with a seller buyer who has a good history of payment. In other words, reputation as always, is everything .  Alas,  there  are  a  few  trustworthy  markets  that  have  good  histories  of  doing things properly, thank heavens .  Blackbank is one. Agora is another. Take a look at the Multi-Sig Escrow  Onion page here with Tor :  http:  u5z75duioy7kpwun.onion wiki index.php Multi-Sig_Escrow  Security  W HAT  THE  EFFECT would  be  if  a  hacker  gained  entry  to  the  server? What mischief might he make? What chaos could he brew if he can mimic running a withdrawal in the same manner that the server does ?  If  a  hacker  were  to  gain  access  and  attempt  to  withdraw  money,  a single-signature would be applied and passed to the second sig signer for co-signature. Then the security protocol would kick in where these policies would be enforced :  1.  Rate limits: the rate of stolen funds slows 2.  Callbacks to the spender's server: Signing service verifies with the original  spender  that  they  initiated  and  intended  to  make  the  spend.  The   callback could go to a separated machine, which could only contain access to isolated approved withdrawal information .  3.  IP limiting: The signing service only signs transactions coming from a certain list of IPs, preventing the case where the hacker or insider stole the private key .  4.  Destination Whitelists: Certain very high security wallets can be set such  that  the  signing  service  would  only  accept  if  the  destination  were previously known. The hacker would have to compromise both the original sending server as well as the signing service .  Let me repeat that MultiSigna are never in possession of your bitcoins. They  use  2  of  3  signatures   seller,  buyer  &  MultiSigma   to  sign  a transaction.  Normal  transactions  are  signed  by  the  seller  and  then  by  the buyer .  P URCHASER STEPS FOR MULTISIG ESCROW  1.   Deposit  your  Bitcoins.  Purchase  ability  is  granted  after  6  confirmations  2.  Make a private & public key  Brainwallet.org is a JavaScript Client-  Side Bitcoin Address Generator    3.  Buy item, input public-key & a refund BTC address 4.  Retrieve purchased item 5.  Input the private key and close   TEN  THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW  C an the law steal funds ?  Assuming you mean U.S. law, no, since the wallet does not contain the money. The Bitcoin blockchain prevents this. Hackers cannot steal it either since two private-keys are required and they will have had to steal 2 out of 3 private key holders... not likely .  W HAT ABOUT SAFETY in using the private key ?  Never irresponsibly use the private key from your Bitcoin wallet. Create a  new  one  love  you  give  your Truecrypt DiskDecryptor master keys. Lots and lots of special love that no one else gets .  instead.  Give   the  same   it   T HIS SOUNDS AWFULLY RISKY. Won't I get caught ?  Here is how most people get caught, and it really matters not what it is.  Most dealers get busted making the usual mistakes :  - Bar Bragging - Dropping too much personal data to strangers  I.e. Ross Ulbricht   - Selling contraband to undercover law enforcement - Snitches - Committing crimes while under surveillance - Managing an operation that grows by leaps and bounds  with loads of  newbies making mistakes  .   H OW FAR WILL the police go to catch you? That's a good question. The answer thought is pretty simple: As far as resources allow .  It'll  probably  be  no  worse  than  what  Charleton  Heston  suffered  being hogtied and dragged around the ape city, but know that some apes are worse than others .  It boils down to if what you're doing . Case 1: In 2010, police in L.A. organized a phony sweepstakes scheme in order to lure in those with outstanding warrants. I kid you not, they did not  come  up  with  this  idea  themselves,  but  rather  took  it  from  The Simpsons .  They  sent  out  close  to  a  thousand  fake  letters  under  the  name  of  a marketing group only to have a little over half a dozen show up at the La Mirada Inn for their free prize: A BMW 238. Nice, eh? Only the joke was on them as their smiles melted upon hearing those four dirty words, "You're all under arrest !"  The poor saps even brought ID to verify their identities. Dumb. They  might as well have slapped on the cuffs themselves .  And this is an OFFLINE example. Imagine what one department can do by lying alone to an ISP or search engine. Threats of fines. Warrants. Bad publicity.  Subpoenas  of  users.  A  bad  reputation  they  are  not  likely  to recover from soon. Police in Vegas in particular love to play dirty like this, dredging up old laws to ensure every member in that Ferbie operation has the book thrown at him .  I N 2013, a Secret Service Agent arrested  several  online  by  selling  them fake IDs. The kicker ?  They were all charged under the RICO Act of 1970. Originally created to put away mobsters, it allows them to lasso entire groups and charge each individual  as  if  he  committed  the  same  crime  everyone  else  in  the  group did... no matter the role .  Translation: The courier gets the same treatment as the ringleader, as do the  buyers.  Individually,  not  much  prison  time  in  the  grand  scheme  of   things in 1970, but being charged as a GROUP? Twenty years minimum. Al Capone never saw such a hefty sentence .  It simply doesn't matter to a prosecutor if you're OS is encrypted and they can't get the data. All they need to prove is that you were part of the enterprise operation. That can be done outside of your shiny new Western Digital hard drive by subpoena to your ISP and a few other services you subscribe to. They've done this  and succeeded  with the newsgroup porn bust  years  ago  in  which  every  member  of  that  hideous  pedo  group  had encryption coming out of their ears .  Here was the short list of rules in that group . - Never reveal true identity to another member of the group - Never communicate with a member of the group outside usenet - Group membership remains strictly within the confines of the Internet - No member can positively identify another - Members do not reveal personally identifying information - Primary communications newsgroup is migrated regularly - If a member breaks a security rule fails to encrypt a message=BAN -  Periodically  reduce  chance  of  law  enforcement  discovery  on  each  newsgroup migration by :  - Creating new PGP key pair, unlinking from previous messages - Each member creates a new nickname - Nickname theme selected by Yardbird  Group leader    T HE AFFIDAVITS READ like a Hell's Angels list of rules. And though I disagree with his  the website owner, not Yardbird  conclusion that "there are basically no nice people who provide case studies of OPSEC practices," I believe much can be learned by studying the habits of law-abiding citizen and criminal alike, especially considering the wide net over which the NSA is casting over law abiding citizens .  Remember  that  in  Nazi  Germany,  if  you  slandered  the  SS,  it  was considered  a  capital  offense.  The  film  'Sophie  Scholl'  is  an  excellent example of underground resistance movement for the right reason. It won accolades for its realistic portrayal of a college woman who stood up to the SS elite and was beheaded for it .  North  Korea,  Now.  Same  thing.  They'd  have  little  issues  with  doing worse.  Beheading  might  be  almost  too  lenient  for  them  as  they  prefer   prolonged, tortuous environments for their subjects. China? China has done some  strange  things,  like  outlawing  stripping  at  funerals  and  banning Bitcoin transactions, and I do recall the violent protests by Muslims in 2010 and  thinking  "Those  communist  schmucks  will  round  up  all  those screaming fools and shoot them at dawn and not look back !"  My Chinese girlfriend leaned over to me as we watched and mumbled,  "They won't wait till dawn ."  I like to think of Darkcoin as Bitcoin's smarter brother. Much smarter in fact, and darker. The best part of course being that it is constantly evolving . Like  Bitcoin  they  are  a  privacy-centric  digital  money  based  on  the Bitcoin design. It's a design that allows for anonymity as you make day-to- day  purchases  on,  well,  just  about  anything  so  long  as  the  digital  store offers it .  With Bitcoin, anyone can see who made a purchase by only looking at the public blockchain. What Darkcoin does is anonymize your transaction further  by  using  Master  nodes  -  a  decentralized  network  of  servers  that negate any requirement for third-parties: Parties that could scam you out of your coins .  Though  few  outlets  use  it,  it  is  one  of  the  quickest  growing  digital currencies  out  there,  with  an  economy  breaching  over  twenty  million. Impressive. And that's not all. It's "Darksend" feature is quite fascinating-- increasing  privacy  by  compounding  a  typical  transaction  with  two  other users .  Needless to say, this is immensely attractive to a lot of Tor users who value  high  anonymity.  Whistleblowers,  journalists,  underground  political movements. That's the good list. The bad list though, well, you can never have  the  good  without  the  bad:  Terrorists.  Contract  killers.  Tax  evaders. Fallout players with the child-killing perk .  I hear the same arguments against its use that I heard with Freenet: Bad guys  want  to  evade  detection.  Bad  guys  trade  Darkcoins.  You  use Darkcoins.  Therefore,  you're  a  bad  guy.  Cue  torches  and  pitchforks  and black cats catapulted over the moat .  Heroin  dealers  love  to  use  cash  yet  you  never  hear  news  outlets screaming about cash-only users linking to such a crime. Besides, the most corrupt money launderers are the central banks. It is they that allow states to borrow from future citizens to pay today's debts. One need only look at the National Debt to realize this .   But  that's  not  to  say  Darkcoins  are  without  issues.  A  few  excellent  - What if these "Masternodes" eventually form centralization ? -  What  if  Darkcoin  is  abandoned  by  the  creators  once  the  price  goes  questions have arisen :  through the roof ?  - Who is trustworthy enough to "audit" Darkcoin? We saw an audit with Truecrypt in 2013 which turned out to show no backdoors... except that the developers shut it down with a cryptic message saying Truecrypt was Not Secure Anymore. We can argue all day about what that meant .  These  questions  may  never  be  answered.  But  that  should  not  stop  us  from forging a new frontier in anonymity services .  Using Darkcoin for Business  I T IS much harder to run a Hidden Tor Service than it is to open a business using Darkcoin. It's so simple really that it boggles the mind what might be available in the future... and with minimal risk to you .  If  this  appeals  to  you,  then  get  the  Darkcoin  Wallet  .  This  is  used  to send receive store  Darkcoin  with  the  benefit  of  using  Darksend  for  100% anonymity. Most of your patrons will want you to have a wallet, so better to learn it early in the business rather than later .  Pick a Transaction Processor  B ELOW ARE a few you can research to your liking. Not every processor will  suit  everyone  just  as  every  bank  or  credit  union  will  not  appeal  to everyone.  You  must  judge  these  yourself,  weighing  your  needs  with whatever risk your business entails. I've tried most of these and came away satisfied but like everything else with crypto currency, what works for me may not work for you .  A LTACCEPT   Fees Transaction: 0.25% + 0.0005 DRK; Withdrawal: 0.01 DRK  C OINPAYMENTS  Transaction: 0.50%; Withdrawal: Network transaction fee  TX    C OINTOPAY  Transactions:  0%   coin  to  coin   0.5%   coin  to  fiat ;  Withdrawal:  Network transaction fee  TX    Transaction: 0.5%; Withdrawal: Included with transaction fee .  D ARKCOIN GRAPHICS  COURTESY of the Darkcoin homepage    After this you should signup to the Merchant Directory . Then   optionally ,  do  some  reading  on  InstantX.  InstantX  is  a  double spend  proof  instant  transaction  method  via  the  masternode  network.  Not exactly light reading, but the more you know ...  N O SINGLE ENTITY has control of the entire system. Though the chance of  an  accident  borders  on  the  not  likely  ,  you  need  to  remember  that Darkcoin  is  still  in  development  and  because  of  that,  unforeseen  things happen.  So  a  healthy  dose  of  due  diligence  is  required.  I  suggest  only purchasing with money that doesn't break the bank in case bad luck happens upon you .  the  anonymizing  process  executes  more   Frequent  backups  are  mandatory  for  your  wallet,  more  than  Bitcoin since  the background. If you've ever used Freenet, you know how slow the network can be and how much of a system resource hog anonymity often requires. Thus, make a new backup of your wallet whenever a you hit a coin ceiling .  transactions   in    ELEVEN  TOR HIDDEN SERVICES  H ow to Setup a Hidden Service on Tor  O NE BENEFIT to using Tor is that it allows you to create hidden services that will mask your identity to other users. In fact, you can have a website that  is  untraceable  to  you  personally,  provided  you've  taken  all  security precautions to keep your system updated. Here is an example of an onion site only accessible by using Tor :  H TTP:  DUSKGYTLDKXIUQC6. ONION    N  ATURALLY  YOU  CAN'T  ACCESS  this  with  your  Firefox  browser without Tor, hence the "hidden" name .  This chapter will give you the basics on what you need to set up your own  Tor  hidden  service.  It's  not  meant  to  be  all-inclusive  that  covers everything  and  the  kitchen  sink,  but  only  to  give  you  an  idea  of  the technical know-how you need to possess .  S TEP ONE: Ensure Tor Works   Follow the directions on installing Tor, securing it against exploits and  security vulnerabilities first and foremost .  Each OS has it's own vulnerabilities, with Windows being the worst. I recommend you go with Linux after you've mastered the basics as it gives you more control over Tor and is far more resistant to attacks than Windows .  Now  might  be  a  good  time  to  state  the  obvious,  something  you've probably realized by now, and that is this: That no two counter-intelligence experts ever do the same thing the same way all the time. There is no red pill  that  makes  it  "All  Clear."  No  cheat  sheet  of  Magic  Opsec  Sauce  that everyone can master if they only gulp it down. You can't memorize every organic compound combination in Organic Chemistry. Believe me, I tried. There were far too many .  What you do however is memorize the general principles , from which you can derive a solution to every problem that comes about. Anonymity is sometimes  like  that.  Your  strengths  will  not  be  your  neighbor's  strengths. Your weaknesses will be different as well. You adapt as you go along, and I can guarantee you your skills as a hobbyist will far exceed those working on the government dole .  S TEP TWO: Installing Your Own Web Server  A local web server is the first thing you need to configure. It is a bit  more involved than space here allows  without jacking the price  .  You  also  want  to  keep  this  local  server  separate  from  any  other installations that you have to avoid cross-contamination. In fact, you don't want ANY links between your hidden server and your day-to-day computer usage outside Tor .  Your server must be set to disallow any data leaks that might give away your  identity.  So  you  must  attach  the  server  to  localhost  only.  If  you're swapping  trade  secrets  and  don't  want  the  boss  to  know,  use  a  virtual machine to prevent DNS and other data leaks, but only if you can access the physical  host  yourself.  Professional  web  hosting  services   i.e.  the  Cloud  are  a  big  no-no  since  it  is  stupid  easy  for  the  admin  to  snatch  your encryption keys from RAM .  Go to http:  localhost:8080  via browser, since that is the port-number you entered at creation. Copy a text doc to the usual html-folder and ensure   it copies successfully by logging into the webpage .  C ONFIGURATION  Now comes the part where most people quit. Don't worry, it isn't hard. It's  just  that  beginners  see  these  numbers  and  think  "Oh  no...  math!"  and throw the book out the window .  But that's not what you'll do... because you're a smart cookie . First, set your hidden-service to link to your own web-server. You can use Notepad to open your "torrc" file within Tor directory and do a search for the following piece of code :   This section is just for location-hidden services  As you can see, the hidden services function of Tor is edited out by the "" sign, where each row relates to a hidden service. HiddenServiceDir is the section that will house all data about your own hidden service. Within this will be the hostname.file. This is where your onion-url will be .  The "HiddenServicePort" allows you to set a decoy port for redirects to  throw off any efforts at detecting you. So add these to your torrc file .  HiddenServiceDir  Library Tor var lib tor hidden_service   HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:8080 Next, alter the HiddenServiceDir to the real directory from which Tor  runs .  For Windows, use : HiddenServiceDir C:\Users\username\Documents\tor\hidden_service HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:8080  F OR LINUX :   home username hidden_service ,   whatever you named that directory .  substituting   "username"  with  R ESTART TOR after saving the Torrc-file and it should be operational. Check your spelling if it throws out any errors .  Now  then.  Two  files  are  created:  the  private_key  and  the  hostname; private keys for your hidden service which you should keep under lock and   key. The hostname is not your private key, however. You can give this to anyone you wish .  A descriptor for the hidden service links to other Tor servers and their respective directories so that Tor users can download it anonymously when they link or access to your hidden server .  O THER POINTS of note  web-server is Thttpd or Apache .  - Visitors to your hidden service may be able to identify whether your  - If your offline 50% of the time, so will your hidden service. Little bits  or lengthy ones, in this case  of data like this are useful to an adversary creating a profile on you .  - It is wiser to create a hidden service on Tor clients versus Tor relays as  the relay uptime is visible to the public .  -  Be  aware  that  you  are  not  a  Node  by  default.  On  that  point,  it  is advised to not have a relay running on the same machine as your hidden service as this opens security risks .  Shallot and Scallion Option  Y OU ALSO HAVE the option of using Shallot or Scallion . Shallot allows one  to  create  a  customized  .onion  address  for  a  hidden  service,  such  as yyyyynewbietestyyyy.onion  On Running a Hidden Tor Server  and other Opsec Magic Sauce   Having used Tor for many years, it came as a pleasant surprise to learn how  few  incidents  there  were  in  which  the  NSA  managed  to  disrupt  Tor. And  I  don't  mean  spam,  either,  but  rather  something  that  brought  large sections  of  the  network  to  a  grinding  halt.  As  it  turns  out,  they're  bark  is much  worse  than  their  bite,  especially  if  one  is  vigilant  with  their  own secure setup .  The thing is, most Tor users couldn't be bothered. But then most users aren't  interested  in  running  a  hidden  server  just  as  most  P2P  users  don't bother  seeding.  Most  are  hit  n'  run  downloaders.  They  know  that  as  U.S. citizens they stand a good chance of getting sued if they leave their balls out   there  long  enough.  So  some  users  opt  to  not  further  their  own  security knowledge. Let the Tor devs do it, they say. Can't be bothered .  Except  most  of  the  Tor  advice  by  Tor  developers  I've  read  come  up woefully inadequate. In fact I find that they aren't paranoid nearly enough . It's always been my belief that you can never be sufficiently paranoid as far as protecting your freedom is concerned, since the powers that be want to capture  it  and  bottle  it  the  way  a  cancer  captures  control  of  a  cell:  One organelle at a time with little of it's environment aware of the slow-boiling attack. To be honest... I suspect they depend on apathy and ignorance. And a lot of users gladly oblige .  Mr. Frog, meet boiling pot of water . So then, what can we do? Well for starters, we can get the right security  mindset .   TWELVE  TOR & YOUR RIG  Tor and Your PC  A secure computer is your best defense as the NSA mostly relies on man- in-the-middle attacks and browser exploits that deliver payloads to hidden Tor servers. That said, you should anticipate and expect such an exploit can infiltrate  your  system  at  any  point.  Things  like  Nits   network  bugs ,  you have to be aware of. Thus the need to adhere to the following :  Use  Linux  whenever  possible.  Yes,  I  know  you're  comfortable  using Windows and think Linux too much of a bother. But you won't if you're ISP is  subpoenaed  for  something  you  said  on  Facebook.  Something  anti- feminist, for instance. So learn to use it .  The powers that be typically target the weakest system and the laziest users.  The  Tor  Browser  Bundle  for  Windows  was  instrumental  in  taking down Freedom Hosting and Silk Road because of unpatched vulnerabilities. That, and a few rogue Tor exit nodes patched unsigned Windows packages to spread malware .  If  you're  new  to  Linux,  look  at  Linux  Mint.  If  you're  experienced, Debian is a good choice. Windows can't be trusted primarily because it is closed-source, but also because malware is more effective on it than Linux. If Linux is out of the question, consider Tails or Whonix as these apps come preconfigured to not allow any outgoing connections to clearnet .  Update Update Update   Y OUR PC MUST ALSO BE UPDATED, ALWAYS. Not updating leads to  vulnerabilities  and  exploits  such  as  those  in  Windows.  Optimally,  you should ensure Tails is always updated each time you use Tor, and avoid any sites that use Java Javascript Flash or any kind of scripting as these execute code in ways you cannot see. Use these only in an emergency and never in your home system .  Avoid  using  cookies  wherever  possible.  Consider  installing  the  Self-  Destructing Cookies add-on .  Again, you should not use anything but a portable PC since your home PC is most likely not portable enough to be discarded in a trash can in the event of compromise .  Avoid  Google  wherever  possible.  Use  DuckDuckGo  or  Startpage  instead for Tor sessions .  Situation Awareness  H ERE WE GO AGAIN. But reading things three times often becomes a trigger in the brain later on for taking action, so here it is .  If an agency can monitor your local connection as well as the link you are browsing, then  with sufficient resources  they can apply traffic analysis to pinpoint your real location. Therefore, I recommend you do not use Tor in your residence .  Just to clarify, do not use Tor in your legal residence if doing any kind of covert work or anything illegal without strict security measures in place; the kind the average Tor user will likely overlook. Let that other guy learn his lesson. It's a tough break, but better him than you. He's a 19 year old named  Jimmy  who  likes  hacking.  You're  a  32  year  old  construction  guy with two kids and a mortgage. Who has more to lose? Right, you. So study counter-surveillance  and  counter-forensics  like  your  life  depends  on  it. Because it does !  For enemies of the state-level operations, I would suggest not engaging anything even near your online PC at home. Certainly nothing that makes you think you need Tor to hide it. It may be fine for private browsing but not for someone planning a coup, running an illegal operation  home bible study in Iran, for instance , or trying to disappear .   Be wary of using it in hotels as well, where often there are many cams watching with 24 hr surveillance. That location can be linked to Tor activity .  Do not use Tor more than a day in any specific location. A correlation- attack can be done in less than an hour if a black van is parked nearby--a van you will not see. They may not slap the cuffs on you as you walk out of the  cafe  that  very  week,  but  later  they  might.  Consider  the  area  a  toxic dump after a day, regardless if you must travel to the next shop or town .  If you want to get really cloak and dagger about it, have an app running  an MMO, for instance  while you are out and about doing your Tor activity that makes it look like you were home during that time .   THIRTEEN  TOR HIDDEN SERVICES RULES  H igh Risk, High Reward  C NN, along with FoxNews and a hotbed of other media outlets, has been trumpeting  the  defeat  of  certain  hidden  services  for  a  few  years  now.  It makes for good headlines. Services like Silk Road and Freedom Hosting, which I'm sure you've heard about. They are a easy target for the FBI since hidden services are not high on the list of priorities by Tor developers yet. Same for the NSA .  Both agencies know every trick and hack there is to know about running a  hidden  service.  And  so  should  you.  This  is  not  to  say  you  need  the expertise to match their team of super hackers, but that you need even more vigilance to run such a service than you do visiting such a service .  Priority number one is simple: if you run one, you must own one. They must not be run under somebody else's control if you can help it, because if that  service  is  compromised,  everyone  goes  down.  That  means  total anonymity, 100% of the time with world-class jewel-thief stealth ability .  The Silk Road admin did not have this ability. In fact, looking through the online docs detailing the arrest, one gets the impression he was very lax in IT security procedure. He repeatedly made mistakes such that luck on the part of LE never really came into it at all. The guy was just sloppy .  F IRST   Never, ever, ever run a hidden service within a VM that is owned by a friend or a Cloud space provider. Remember, all "The Cloud" is, is someone else's drive or network, not your own. Encryption keys can be dumped from RAM. And who owns the RAM ?  Right. The Cloud provider. Lightning strikes and there goes your own anonymity as well as the anonymity of your visitors if they are lazy in their browser habits. The FBI delivered a "nit"  network investigative technique  this way to unpatched Tor Browser Bundles in 2013. If, however, you own the  machine,  then  it's  a  different  story.  But  let's  back  up  a  few  steps  and assume you don't. How might you go about running it on a host system ?  Well  first  off,  you  would  need  two  separate  physical  hosts  from different parties, both running in virtual machines with a firewall-enabled OS that only allows Tor network activity and nothing else .  The second physical host is the one the hidden service runs from, also  VM'ed. Secure connections are enabled by IPSec. What's IPSec, you ask ?  "IPSec  is  a  protocol  suite,  for  securing  Internet  Protocol   IP  communications  by  authenticating  and  encrypting  each  IP  packet  of  a communication session. IPsec can be used in protecting data flows between a pair of hosts  host-to-host , between a pair of security gateways  network- to-network , or between a security gateway and a host  network-to-host  ." If an intruder agent tampers with anything, you will know about it and can shut down the service or move it to a safer place, and all while being a ghost in the machine. You can imagine how valuable this would be in North Korea .  If  you  were  in  that  cesspool  of  a  country,  you  would  be  more  than  a little  paranoid  if  the  server  went  down  even  for  a  few  seconds.  But  you could always move it to a more secure location or even start over, and you might  just  want  to  since  you  would  not  know  if  a  RAID  failure  had occurred or if some commie jackboot was sending a copy of the VM to the higher ups .  S ECOND  If going the host route, you must ensure that remote-console is always available to you by the host, any time you want. You must do everything remotely, in fact, and change passwords frequently via https. I'd say once   per  day  as  paranoia  in  such  a  climate  as  North  Korea  would  be  good  for your health .  T HIRD  You must never, not even once, access the service from home. Not from your  Nexus  7.  Not  from  your  girlfriend's  Galaxy  Note.  Not  even  via  Tor from  your  backyard  using  your  neighbor's  WiFi.  Using  a  VPN  as  well  is risky  unless  you  know  what  you're  doing.  Only  access  it  via  secure locations at least ten miles away from your residence. Overkill, some might say, but then there is no such thing as overkill in a gulag .  F OURTH  Move  the  service  on  occasion.  Again,  look  at  any  Youtube  video  on how snipers train to take out an enemy. They move place to place after each shot to conceal the true location from the enemy. How often is up to you. Once  a  week?  Once  a  month?  Personally  I'd  say  every  twenty-one  days. You can never be too secure when running one of these .   FOURTEEN  DARKNET PERSONAS  "W e've been watching you Mr. Anderson, and it seems you've been living... two lives. One of them has a future, and one does not.“ -- Agent Smith, The Matrix  Y OU'VE no doubt read of Tor busts where an undercover agent snagged a phone  number  or  clearnet  nic  from  someone  they  were  targeting  because said target trusted too much, too quickly. Take it from Yoda - You can avoid this by retraining yourself, unlearning what you've learned .  You  must  consider  your  Tor  sessions  the  property  of  your  other  Self. The  cloned  You  -  that  shadowy  thievish  looking  guy  above.  The  second You.  One  that  despises  Incubus  and  loves  Tool  and  views  Neo  as  just another beta-orbiting punk who got the luck of the draw when Morpheus and crew unplugged him. This clone would not use Twitter or YouTube or other social gunk. He would never hang with you nor call you up for a few   beers.  In  fact,  he  hates  beer,  preferring  J&B  as  he  hacks  with  John Carpenter's  The  Thing  OST  playing  as  mood  music  in  the  background. That's your other You . The smarter you .  And he must be the new You on Tor . And you must forever separate  him from the non-Tor You .  once used them on his home PC .  His Facebook, Twitter and YouTube accounts are all fake, having never  His  nics  are  different,  as  is  his  passwords,  likes dislikes  and  even  the fonts he uses to browse the Deep Web. Mixing this dark persona with your own would be like the boy made of matter kissing the anti-matter girl .  Boom . Further, any phone calls this person makes is done by prepaid phones that were not purchased by any credit cards he holds. He is a cash n' carry guy and then only if he is twenty miles from home. Any SIM cards he uses are strictly used in conjunction with Tor activity and never used in phones the  other  guy  uses.  And...  he  deliberately  leaves  false  info  wherever  he goes. Kinda like the CIA does .  But to better clarify this idea, let's assume John Doe doesn't know any better. He watches a movie on Netflix. Then he mosies on over to Freenet and  drops  intel  without  even  realizing  it,  eager  to  share  his  great  cinema experience with his darknet buds  no pun  .  "Hey  guys,  just  watched  a  cool  flick  with  Russell  Crowe.  Kinda Michael Bay-ish and Liam Neeson's cameo was too short, but makes for a good flick if you want to learn how to disappear. But those police, sweet Jesus! Those rent-a-cop guys sure are as dumb as a sack of bricks !"  Police are dumb, he says . Metadata  is  collected  by  Netflix  just  as  it  is  with  Google  and  Yahoo. Every single user. They know every film you viewed and even which ones you  hated.  He's  even  made  forum  posts  indicating  similar  weather  and, though  not  mentioning  names,  has  griped  about  local  politicians  being handcuffed in very geo-specific arrests, even dropping the charges !  How many Netflix fans do you think watched this movie at the time of his Freenet post? How many in cities that had local politicians arrested for embezzling?  How  many  with  similar  weather  depicted  in  the  film?  Most likely less than ten. Maybe not even that .  There is also the handwriting element. Does he mispell the same words over and over? Throw commas like daggers? Misuse semi-colons and run-   on sentences? System clock out of sync with his posts? All of this leads to a great profile that ties his IP address to his identity. Often it is enough to get a  warrant  if  he  so  much  as  whispers  that  he's  obtained  any  kind  of contraband .  Unless of course, all of this info is tailor-made to fit the other You . We  already  know  that  the  VPN  called  Hide-My-Ass  as  well  as Hushmail  and  Lavabit  stabbed  their  users  in  the  back  when  threats  by  a judge became too heated  $5000 a day in Lavabit's case, until they forked over user data . And all this just so they could track Edward Snowden .  Bottom  line:  Learn  from  Snowden's  mistakes.  Take  every  company's claim  of  anonymity  with  a  grain  of  salt.  The  proof  is  in  the  amount  of arrests tied to said company or app. In the case of Freenet, none .  But there is always a first time. Recall that they only have to get lucky  once, which more often than not relies on your carelessness .   USENET: THE ULTIMATE GUIDE   TABLE OF CONTENT  W hat is Usenet ?  The Best Newsgroups The Best Usenet Apps Usenet Reviews: Who Sucks. Who Doesn’t Usenet Anonymity Things That Break Anonymity Moderated Usenet Which VPNs You Can Trust The Cloud   WHAT IS USENET?  Y  ou’ve  probably  heard  the  term  “Usenet”  floating  around  various  tech forums of one flavor or another. Some liken the technology as being similar to P2P, while others state that it is nothing like P2P. In truth, it has a little bit of both systems in that  1.  you can find almost any kind of file therein, such as mp3s, games,  movies and the like and  Pretty neat .  2.   you  have  the  ability  to  upload  and  download  anything  you  like.  Since its inception in 1979 by two Duke graduate students, Usenet has leapt  beyond  all  expectations  in  regards  to  not  only  data  retention,  but enhancing  freedom  of  speech.  Whereas  users  were  once  inundated  with extra charges per month for downloading a handful of data, they now have the  ability  to  download  terabytes  per  month,  and  pay  ridiculously  small sums to do so. This has all been done with the help of not only thousands of server farms across the world, but also by legions of longtime Usenet users who upload  and leech  every kind of data file in existence. Thus, the true ingredients  for  the  worldwide  success  of  Usenet  hasn’t  been  so  much because of Usenet providers themselves, but by end-user subscribers who faithfully upload the latest movie, game and music releases every month to the over 100,000 available newsgroups on Usenet .  What  typically  happens  when  the  average  Joe  off  the  street  wants  to subscribe to Usenet? He usually ends up test driving a free trial by one of the dozens of Usenet providers for a period of two weeks, and then like any P2P user, they are hooked for life. Or at least, the life of the subscription .  And that subscription will likely last a long time .   Why ? The answer lies in the perceived value of the goods he acquires through  said Usenet subscription .  As  mentioned,  the  worth  of  the  goods  acquired  far  outweighs  the monthly  fee  of  the  Usenet  provider.  There  are  over  100,000  newsgroups, with the large majority of them being TEXT groups rather than BINARY groups  i.e. where the real meat of Usenet is stored . The dirty little secret among  long-time  Usenet  users  is  this:  Usenet  would  not  be  one-tenth  as popular as it is if it weren’t for the bulk of groups like alt.binaries.boneless, alt.binaries.hdtv and alt.binaries.complete_cd .  One could make the argument that text discussions certainly have their place that benefits society in some manner, however the bottom line is that file sharing  again, mp3s, movies and games  make up the bulk of not only Usenet,  but  is  the  reason  Usenet  companies  have  been  able  to  grow  their businesses at exponential rates .   USENET VS. P2P  I f you’ve paid attention to the news media outlets over the past ten years, you’re aware of the inherent risks associated with using P2P systems like Emule, Limewire and the like in acquiring copyrighted material .  When  you  fire  up  a  P2P  program  like  Emule,  you  participate  in downloading with your IP address out in the open, from which peers run by law enforcement  i.e. NordicMule  or the Recording Industry can monitor the source and destination with every file you transmit through the network. P2P in effect requires its participants to upload as well as download. It is not  so  different  than  downloading  torrents  in  this  regard.  Usenet  on  the other hand, encourages leeching without uploading .  While you certainly have the freedom to upload, your download speeds are not crippled if you decide only to lurk and leech from the uploads of others. What is more, you do so at your full internet speed, unlike peer-to- peer systems, where you are often at the mercy of others in the swarm .  When someone uploads a copyrighted film  Avengers, for instance  on a p2p or torrent system, it is far easier to track said uploader to an ip address which  leads  straight  to  their  front  door.  If  however  the  uploader  used  a premium  Usenet  provider  to  upload  the  film,  the  movie  industry  lawyer must  first  get  his  subscriber  information  from  the  Usenet  company  them before any action is taken. If he accessed his Usenet account through a vpn provider, and used anonymous means to pay for his Usenet account, then that adds a further layer of privacy that the entertainment industry lawyers will have to peel back in order to reveal his identity. We’ll discuss later on the fruitfulness of signing up anonymously with Usenet and Vpn providers .  Pros to Usenet :   Not dependent on seeders like torrents Uses full bandwidth available on your internet connection MPAA  Movie Industry , RIAA  Recording Industry  cannot see your downloads as they can with torrents Can utilize SSL to encrypt data en route to your pc  unlike torrents   In its 30 year history, no one has ever been sued for downloading anything off Usenet  again, unlike with torrents    Cons to Usenet :  requires a paid subscription to access older posts posting reading comments require a newsreader not as easily accessible as torrent sites  Signing up for Usenet  F OR USERS who value privacy  For  those  who  are  simply  not  concerned  about  privacy,  you  may confidently  resist  the  upselling  offers  of  your  Usenet  provider’s advertisements  regarding  SSL.  At  signup  for  some  of  the  lesser  known Usenet  providers,  the  advertising  might  incline  you  to  believe  that  you absolutely have to have SSL as an option, otherwise your PC will certainly be hacked by all manner of gremlins, evil gnomes and other bogeymen. Do not  believe  it.  SSL  often  comes  free  with  a  subscription  to  the  major providers, however some providers will still charge extra for it .  F OR USERS who value anonymity  Some Usenet providers accept bitcoins as a method of payment. If you are going to be uploading a large amount of legally questionable files and are  based  in  the  US,  it  might  be  prudent  to  sign  up  anonymously  for  a   Usenet  account.  Do  not  use  any  kind  of  payment  that  carries  personal information about you, such as your name, bank and the like . Isn’t Uploading to Usenet Anonymous with SSL Enabled ? The  answer  to  this  question  is:  sort  of.  Yes,  you  can  download  with impunity. Yes, it encrypted the data in route to your pc, from which point it is  decrypted  with  the  decryption  key.  Most  Usenet  providers  do  not  keep download  logs  of  what  you  siphon  from  the  binary  Usenet  newsgroups. However,  the  catch  is  that  if  you  upload,  certain  information  is  left  as breadcrumbs  to  your  Usenet  account.  Your  messages,  in  addition  to  your uploads  all of them  contain unique header identification breadcrumbs, so to speak .  If for instance you were part of some conspiracy group of assassins and shouted in some obscure newsgroup that you were going to assassinate the president of the United States, then the Secret Service could look at your headers and find out from the Usenet provider where you lived if you did not  sign  up  anonymously.  The  nntp  posting  host  &  X-Trace  lines accomplish this as it often relays the identity of the Usenet server, which in turn leads to your specific account .  The  Secret  Service  would  have  no  idea  that  YOU  posted  it,  but  they would  know  you  used  Astraweb  or  Easynews  to  post  it.  They  in  all probability would not even need a subpoena for subscriber information, as most  of  the  big  Usenet  providers  would  gladly  provide  subscriber information  that  involved  terrorist  threats,  illegal  porn  or  identity  fraud  spam  is  a  bit  more  involved,  but  then  again,  the  Secret  Service  doesn’t investigate Usenet spam  .  There also exists the possibility that the header could be encrypted by the  Usenet  server  themselves,  in  which  case  it  can  only  be  decrypted  by them. The header might have some lengthy mosaic of jumbled letters mixed in  with  numbers.  It  might  say  “sdauhjk7tt324-=asdsad”,  which  of  course would be unreadable to anyone except the Usenet provider, as they hold the decryption key and no other Usenet provider does .  It  is  somewhat  similar  in  concept  to  the  headers  from  a  free  email service such as Yahoo or Hotmail. This is how the hacker who pried into vice-presidential  candidate  Sarah  Palin’s  email  was  arrested:  by  revealing the  headers  in  the  address  bar.  The  FBI  took  this  information  from  a screenshot the hacker had posted and traced it back to the source .   A  vpn  service  would  not  have  helped  in  such  a  scenario,  since  they themselves  are  bound  by  the  law,  and  most  of  them  reside  in  the  US anyway. The only way he would have gotten away with it  that is, bragging via a screenshot of her email account with the header exposed  is if he had used Tor to do so from step one .  Ironically enough, it seems that a hacker’s worst enemy is himself .   THE BEST NEWSGROUPS  R ecommended binary newsgroups worth exploring :  A  lt.binaries.hdtv  :  This  is  perhaps  the  quintessential  newsgroup  that carries  almost  any  kind  of  high  definition  material  you  could  ever  want. Documentaries, mainstream films, tv shows and the like can be found here free for the taking. Be aware that many movies here tend to be passworded. Thus, it is prudent to download the first rar file of the set, extract it, and preview  it.  Winrar  will  complain  that  it  is  broken,  but  extract  it  anyway. You’ll get a ten minute preview of the film, or it will complain about the lack  of  a  password  entered.  Some  passwords  can  only  be  gained  from private forums. If you see a movie you desperately want from the group, but was passworded, ask which forum you can join to extract the file .  A  lt.binaries.hdtv.x264  :  Don’t  want  to  have  to  wait  for  eons  for  a  50 gigabyte  movie  to  download  from  the  hdtv  group  above?  Try  its  sister group,  which  is  a  group  dedicated  to  re-encodes  of  most  of  the  popular movie  and  tv  titles.  Re-encoders  will  take  a  fifty  gigabyte  movie  and compress it down to an 8-12 gigabyte file, preserving much of the picture quality of the original fifty gigabyte movie. Not recommended if you watch HD on a projector or own a tv that is 42′ inches and above. However for those with a 27′ inch monitor tv, you will not see much difference as long as the encoder has done a decent job .   A lt.binaries.boneless  :  This  is  an  all-around  depositing  group  where  all manner  of  files  can  be  uploaded.  Anything  and  everything  gets  dumped here,  and  is  one  of  the  largest  groups  on  Usenet.  Only  recommended  to those  with  very  fast  internet  connections,  as  the  header  count  often  takes over  an  hour  on  an  average  connection.  Most  of  the  group  carries everything  you  can  imagine,  which  admittedly  can  be  quite  jarring  for newcomers as there doesn’t seem to be any “one” topic for the group .  A  lt.binaries.movie.divx  :  This  group  is  much  like  the  hdtv  groups, however few movies are here in HD, saving the downloader hours worth of downloading  time.  If  you’re  not  sure  if  a  film  is  worth  owning,  it  might prove prudent to test-drive it first with a much smaller size. Most movies here  are  in  the  one  to  two  gigabyte  size  range  which  is  sufficient  for  a laptop  or  phone,  but  you’ll  notice  a  substantial  difference  on  a  28  inch monitor as opposed to a dvd with a decent bitrate .  A lt.binaries.sounds.mp3.blues :  substitute your favorite genre instead of blues, such as celtic, jazz, new-age, rock, heavy-metal, classical, christian, etc . Be aware than many of the mp3 groups have strict posting guidelines in their faqs, and will report you to your usenet provider if you spam said groups  with  off-topic  mp3s.  However,  they  offer  a  very  narrowly-defined listening experience depending on your favorite musical tastes .  A  lt.binaries.games  :  The  main  group  for  posting  pc-related  games,  yet some console game get posted here rather than their specified groups. Be weary of viruses in this group, irregardless of how big the file is. A good anti-virus program is paramount if you are going to be downloading from this group with any regularity. Disable “autoplay” in your operating system, as  many  a  game  iso  will,  when  mounted,  launch  a  virus  at  the  first execution of the windows autoplay feature. The iso format itself is not to   blame, but rather the file that lie within the folders themselves on the disc image can be virulent .  A lt.binaries.dox : missing an nfo file for a game? This is the place to ask. Game manuals are also uploaded here, along with most every nfo file you can imagine from every “scene” group in existence .  A  word  of  caution  concerning  binary  groups  :  You  will  not  see  much philosophical  discussion  in  these  “binaries”  groups,  aside  from  bickering about  broken  rars not  enough  pars  and  endless  requests.  If  you  want political  or  academic  debate,  subscribe  to  the  lengthy  list   there  are thousands  of alt groups that do not have “binaries” in the title .   THE BEST USENET APPS  O ver the past ten years, Usenet companies have made significant progress in simplifying what was originally a very cumbersome process for Usenet customers.  After  subscribing  to  a  Usenet  provider,  it  is  now  ridiculously simple to access the treasures that Usenet holds .  B ASICS OF USING NEWSGROUPS  for   the   server   address   and  news   Downloading  :  When  you  sign  up  for  a  ten  dollar month  plan,  your NSP   Newsgroup  Service  Provider   will  email  you  three  things:  your username,  password,   i.e. news.astraweb.com as an example . There are many different Usenet tools available that are similar in function to how a browser works. You can opt for the simpler method, which requires downloading an .nzb file from free sites like Binsearch, NZBIndex, or Newzbin  paid  and then importing to a newsreader  or  downloader  of  your  choice.  One  of  the  simplest  is  an  app called Nzb-o-Matic Plus. In the options screen of the application, just insert your  user pass  combo  and  the  server  address  with  port  119,  then  set  a destination where your downloads should reside. You can even choose the desktop. It’s that simple. There are other free newsgroup tools available as well .  N EWSHOSTING CLIENT  REQUIRES signup  Free   The  Newshosting  client  self-repairs  files  for  you  if  you  have  a subscription to them. However this is a bit redundant since Quickpar and Winrar are free .  E ASYNEWS WEB INTERFACE  requires signup  Free  The Easynews Interface is similar to the Newshosting client in that you can  see  thumbnails  of  the  files  posted,  if  they  are  passworded,  and  will check for errors automatically .  N EWSBIN PRO $ 20  S ABNZBD FREE  N EWSLEECHER $ 20  B INREADER FREE  G RABIT FREE  U NISON $ 29.99  E Z GLOBAL SEARCH $ 2.99  N ZB-O-MATIC PLUS: Free   Nzb-o-Matic is perhaps the easiest out of all of the above tools to hop aboard Usenet. It is for downloading only however, but once you have the NZB file, you simply import, set your username pass and download away .  U PLOADING IS A BIT TRICKIER, but by no means are you required to upload anything to Usenet. In fact, leeching is encouraged, unlike torrents. If you are new to Usenet, be aware that anything you upload outside of a private proxy or Tor will leave your IP address exposed. Take care if you are unsure if your uploads are copyrighted or not. As they say, luck favors the prepared .  H  OW  TO  UPLOAD  TO  USENET  :   if  you  have  no  intention  of uploading, skip this    The  process  of  uploading  a  small  file  is  not  extraordinarily  different than  uploading  a  large  file.  The  main  difference  is  that  uploading  a  large file,  say  gigabytes  in  size,  takes  hours  on  a  slow  DSL  connection. Nevertheless, let’s go through some admittedly simplified steps on how to do  so.  You’ll  need  some  free  tools  to  do  so,  though  these  are  fairly mandatory to the entire process. They are :  W INRAR – FOR ARCHIVING THE FILES. You can’t upload a single 25  gigabyte  Blu-Ray  movie  to  Usenet  without  risking  it  failing  or  timing out.  Thus,  it  is  better  to  use  Winrar  to  break  up  your  movie  file  in  small chunks and upload those. You would be pretty angry if you spent two days downloading a Blu-Ray file only to find out that it “skips” in the middle of the  film.  Thus,  Winrar  and  Quickpar  solve  this  problem  by  testing  the authenticity for broken parts. Once you have Winrar installed, right click on the file and select “Add to Archive” from the Winrar context menu. Winrar adds this to the windows context menu, thus with a simple right click you can  archive  any  file  no  matter  the  size.  Just  be  sure  and  choose  an appropriate size to upload. One hundred megabyte chunks is sufficient for anything over 1 gigabyte in size .   Smaller files like mp3s usually are fine with the mp3s non-archived, but will come with par files to repair any redundancies errors in them. When downloaders finish downloading all the rar pieces, they can right click on any of the posted rars and choose “extract here” to the present directory, or any directory they wish. Before they do this however, they will likely run Quickpar  first  to  check  for  errors,  provided  YOU  have  uploaded  pars alongside the rar files of your movie .  D OWNLOAD WINRAR AT :  http:  www.rarlabs.com download.htm  Q UICKPAR – FOR CREATING PAR FILES. This is not mandatory for Usenet uploads  unless the newsgroup specifically asks for it…check their faq , but can be quite a godsend for downloaders as often Usenet servers will “hiccup” during the upload process. Creating parts at 10% redundancy is sufficient for most files .  D OWNLOAD QUICKPAR AT :  http:  www.quickpar.org.uk Download.htm  C  AMELSYSTEM  POWERPOST   WINDOWS  ONLY   -  A  freeware tool used to upload the rar and par files you created. It is delightfully simple to  use.  You  will  need  your  username  and  password  combo  from  your Usenet provider, along with the port number to insert into the settings menu before your are allowed to upload .  Download Powerpost at http:  powerpost.camelsystem.nl e-index.php  N ZB FILES – You can think of NZB files as being similar to torrent files that you load into a downloader program. Only instead of using uTorrent, you would import the file into something like Nzb-o-Matic Plus. The NZB   file  itself  is  the  files  you  have  selected  from  a  site  such  as  Binsearch  or NZBindex.  It  can  contain  any  number  of  pointers  to  the  files  you  want, which  may  be  in  separate  newsgroups.  Using  an  NZB  file  makes  it exponentially easier to manage the files you want, versus those you don’t want.  In  the  old  days  of  Usenet,  you  had  to  use  an  archaic  program  like Agent or Nomad News to manually checkmark each rar or item in separate newsgroups to download what you wanted. This process alone could take an hour or more depending on how many files you wanted. When NZB files came  along,  they  simplified  a  needlessly  cumbersome  process  of  getting what you wanted from your favorite newsgroups .  I NCOMPLETE FILES – INCOMPLETE Usenet files may look complete in your newsreader, but upon downloading the complete set, you discover that Winrar spits out an error midway through extracting the files. This is usually  because  the  uploader  has  an  unstable  connection,  or  perhaps  the power  went  out  upon  uploading  his  files,  or  a  server  hiccupped  during transmission. Usenet servers transfer files from other Usenet servers, and it differs somewhat than your regular run-of-the-mill internet server. For this reason,  you  should  install  the  free  Quickpar  program  to  alleviate  any potential headaches this can cause .  S FV FILES – SFV files can be used to verify that your downloaded file is what it is supposed to be, and if any corruption occurred along the way. It doesn’t repair the file. That is what Quickpar does. This method of repair is quite different  and yet more stable  than what you might be accustomed to using BitTorrent, where pars are rarely provided with seeded files .   USENET REVIEWS; WHO SUCKS, AND WHO  DOESN’T  I  f  you  scout  around  the  major  search  engines  and  use  search  terms  like “usenet” “best usenet prices” and “usenet reviews”, you will literally come across hundreds of websites all clamoring for your referral dollars as they tell you which Usenet provider is best and which ones to avoid. The thing is, most of them offer the exact same services, and by and large are just as competent as the next company .  They  offer  similar  services,  ease  of  use,  and  some  like  Newshosting even offer their own Usenet browser that will do all of the hard work for you.  Almost  all  of  them  offer  free  SSL  and  unlimited  packages  as  well. Usenet-Server and Astraweb seem to be the cheapest, though Astraweb has had its share of problems regarding incomplete uploads in the past .  For  the  purposes  of  anonymity,  going  with  a  US  based  newsgroup provider  probably  isn’t  conductive  to  good  anonymity  practice.  While  it certainly isn’t foolproof to have an account with a European provider if one is uploading copyrighted material to Usenet  or any other illegal activity , the laws in the US are more litigious and draconian than any other country on Earth that houses the server farms of Usenet companies .  T he Big Five  A  straweb  :  Often  the  cheapest  priced  out  of  all  Usenet  providers  with unlimited specials at $11, their past problems have been server downtime as   well as incomplete files  as of 2012 . Posted PAR files will certainly make up  the  difference…most  of  the  time.  However  on  a  dual  core  fitted  pc, quickpar can take more than an hour if a sufficiently large amount of rars are  broken.  In  addition,  their  customer  service  is  not  as  refined  as  say, Easynews or Newshosting, but they cannot be beat for the price they offer. If you don’t mind a few broken files and using Quickpar on a semi-weekly basis, and price is a concern, Astraweb is the prime choice .  U senet Server : Similar to Astraweb but more stable infrastructure. They are  also  a  few  dollars  more  in  price  however  for  their  unlimited  plan. Incompletes  were  not  seen  in  over  two  years  of  using  them.  Thus,  you really see where this extra few dollars per month went: system retention and reliability .  N  ewshosting  :  Similar  to  Usenet-Server,  however  they  provide  a  free newsreader that makes it ridiculously easy to see which files are authentic and which are viruses spam  hint: look at the file size…if it is a heinously small size, it is probably spam or malware . The thumbnail view is similar to what you would see with Easynews’ web interface that scans the thumbs of all the newsgroups you need to view .  E asynews : One of the first companies out of the gate, and one which still does  not  have  the  unlimited  offerings  of  the  above  Usenet  providers. However,  they  are  dirt  cheap,  have  a  reliable  backbone  of  server  farms since they have been in business for eons, and have one of the top forums for troubleshooting and tech issues in the industry. Their customer service is unrivaled as well. The only caveat is that if you are a power user who wants to  download  over  a  hundred  gigabytes  worth  of  data  per  month,  they probably  should  not  be  your  first  choice.  They  are,  like  Giganews, extremely strict with takedown notices from lawyers. If HBO specials and documentaries  are  your  cup  of  tea,  be  aware  that  they  have  the  ability  to “nuke” uploads should they deem it too “hot” to reside on their servers  i.e. Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, etc     G iganews : Undoubtedly  the  most  expensive  of  all  the  Usenet  premium providers.  They  provide  one  of  the  largest  server  backbones,  and  provide similar services as the above mentioned providers. They are considered the “Harvard”  of  Usenet  companies,  however  it  seems  rather  needless  to  pay for  the  name  since  you  get  most  of  the  benefits  from  the  other  big  four Usenet companies. Giganews is also known for giving in to “take down” requests  for  uploaders  of  copyrighted  content,  such  as  HBO  series  like Game  of  Thrones,  in  which  files  were  purged  from  the  servers  in  such  a large quantity as to make pars useless to recover them. The problem therein, is that many smaller Usenet companies use Giganews backend servers for access  to  Usenet.  Thus,  when  they  do  comply  with  a  take  down  order  or request  from  some  Hollywood  law  firm,  other  Usenet  providers  are affected.  If  money  is  not  an  issue,  Giganews  is  a  great  choice  for  their consistently good customer service .  O thers : Thundernews, Newsdemon, Ngroups, etc. The list goes on and on .  You’re taking a spin on the roulette wheel with anyone not in the top five. That is not to say they all provide bad service, but it is important to note that a rock-solid business like those in the top five take years and years of backbreaking work and perseverance .  customer   The lesser known Usenet providers usually are lacking one of three key areas:  support , reliability completion of files, or retention  age of files . Some of them are so  newly  minted  that  they  have  no  choice  but  to  rent  part  of  their infrastructure from the likes of Giganews or Highwinds, which have many, many server farms .   usually   In the end you might ask, what is the number one thing that customers want from a Usenet provider? It is not retention. Most Usenet companies have similar retention rates that span many years. It is not even completion of files. Most large uploads from users around the world upload a sufficient number of pars to repair any large group of posted files such as Blu-Ray  service   emails   from   tech    movies  or  the  like.  No,  what  Usenet  customers  most  want  is  GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE .  Customers don’t want to sit waiting on the phone up to an hour for tech support  to  answer.  To  wit,  they  want  someone  who  speaks  the  same language and in the same dialect. They also don’t want to be spammed with upselling offers by the Usenet company in question  web hosting companies like Godaddy are notorious for this , nor do they like to be called on the phone with such offers .  T he First Rule of Usenet  don’t talk about Usenet !   On many social media sites and forums such as Facebook, Twitter and Reddit,  some  users  will  post  advertisements  from  the  late  nineties  from such big box stores as BestBuy, Wal-Mart, Sears and the like that show a dramatic  difference  in  regards  to  hardware  costs.  For  example,  a  1.5 gigabyte  hard  drive  from  BestBuy  in  2000  cost  over  $200  dollars.  Now however, for the same amount of dollars you can buy a 3 terabyte drive. It is not  that  different  for  Usenet  server  farms.  As  time  goes  by  and  more customers sign on for premium Usenet accounts, the business costs incurred for Usenet companies goes down. That is why you can have an unlimited data account for less than ten dollars a month. So then, why is traditional file-sharing such as torrenting more popular ?  The reason is because it is eminently easier to download a torrent for free  than  it  is  to  fish  out  your  credit  card  and  set  up  a  Usenet  account. Ridiculous, is it not? It is also easier to see comments on a torrent site than read  and  filter  through  all  the  spam  in  a  Usenet  newsgroup  such  as alt.binaries.boneless.  Some  interfaces,  such  as  Newshosting’s  newsgroup browser will filter out most of the spam and passworded files and make it easier to use .  It  is  a  well-known  fact  by  most  BitTorrent  users  that  the  Record  and Movie  industries  like  to  unleash  their  armies  of  lawyers  upon  copyright works  that  have  seeds  numbered  in  the  millions.  This  makes  it  very convincing in a lawsuit as far as who you uploaded files with and to whom you  didn’t.  Often,  a  movie  release  for  September  might  be  leaked  in August,  and  the  swarm  of  users  will  catch  the  attention  of  the  copyright holders and sue the downloaders as well as uploaders provided their true ip address is showing .   This  is  less  the  case  with  Usenet,  where  it  is  not  possible  to  see  who downloaded which file, even in casting a wide net. Thus, if you live in a litigious society like that in the United States, it is to your benefit to learn to utilize Usenet’s strengths in this regard .  On many forums you will hear users say “Usenet is dead” or “Usenet doesn’t have what torrents have”. Take confidence in the fact that people who espouse such nonsense don’t in fact use Usenet themselves. It is not beyond  the  realm  of  impossibility  that  such  naysayers  are  actually attorneys, or employee shills for the record industry who don’t want legions of potential Usenet experts asking too many questions concerning what it has to offer .   USENET ANONYMITY  I n this chapter, we’ll discuss ways you can add anonymity to your Usenet connection, so that you can participate in discussion groups without fear of persecution. These methods often are most useful in situations where you may  lose  your  Usenet  account  if  you  say  the  wrong  things  to  the  wrong people.  Usenet  companies  are  big  business  now,  and  unlike  twelve  years ago, will now think nothing of terminating your account of they get enough complaints.  Simply  being  unpopular  and  taking  a  stand  against  the  status quo  in  certain  newsgroups  can  get  your  Usenet  account  banned   i.e. alt.privacy  .  However,  with  true  anonymity,  they  may  ban  your  account,  but  rest assured  that  not  only  will  your  words  remain  forever  on  Usenet,  but  you will not be persecuted for speaking out against a tyrannical government, or a  company  that  you  work  for   which  has  happened  many  times  by disgruntled employees on Facebook  .  It  should  be  stated  at  the  outset  that  using  Tor  for  Usenet  binary downloads will actually strain the Tor network, just as it does with torrents. And  to  boot,  whenever  you  use  torrents  via  Tor,  the  torrent  software actually sends your IP address to the recipient. It does so anonymously, in the same way a post office worker will deliver you your mail. Needless to say this defeats the purpose of using torrents. This problem is not with the Tor code, but rather the way that applications like BitLord and BitTorrent are designed. The torrent applications themselves need to be coded to allow anonymity.  It  is  better  to  use  Freenet  with  the  Frost  addon  for  p2p-like trading if you wish to remain anonymous .   Tor   is  much  more  efficient  at   textual  discussions  and  binary downloaders using your native connection, but the easiest method to do this anonymously is by use of the remailer network. By using such a method, the  identifying  Usenet  posts  are  stripped  away  from  your  messages, essentially erasing the digital trail that leads back to your IP address .  As we have seen from past media reports around the world over the last several years, there could be any number of valid reasons you want to hide your identity .  - Maybe you work for a computer manufacturer, or perhaps a robotics company  and  are  concerned  about  the  lack  of  safety  measures  being enforced by your superiors, but fear some kind of retaliation by them should you go public, like the loss of your job. Usenet is a great place to ask advice and not worry about the consequences. Places like Facebook and Twitter on the other hand might invite retribution by the executives or CEO of your company .  - It could be that you want to vocally protest your discontent with the direction of the prevailing winds of government. Doing so in countries like the US, Iran, China, and the like could put you on a “watch” list of sorts, and  before  you  know  it,  you  have  problems  relating  to  “no  fly”  lists  at airports and border stations .  - Perhaps you want to establish a free email address that has never had any contact whatsoever with your real IP address. Services like Yahoo Mail, Gmail, and Hotmail repeatedly scan emails looking for keywords or files in which  to  flag.  Shutting  down  your  email  is  one  thing.  Having  your  IP address  along  with  the  email  forwarded  to  government  entities  for prosecution is quite another. Anonymity prevents this from happening .  R EMAILERS  As a crude example, let’s say you own a reporting agency that is active in most of the less-than-savory newsgroups, and you use your email from your  office  quite  regularly.  Then  you  see  a  rape  victim  who  needs  your assistance. You might not want to divulge your email address to everyone. Using a remailer will ensure that any identifying information of you will be erased from the headers of any messages you upload to newsgroups. Your message  will  be  forwarded  to  the  recipient  without  any  risks  of  public disclosure .   T RACEABLE VS. Untraceable Remailers  incident,   Traceable:  there  are  some  types  of  remailers  that  keep  active  lists  of senders pseudonyms  whereby  receivers  can  reply  to  mail  by  fictitious names.  When  the  remailer  gets  a  message,  it  consults  a  list  and  forwards mail to the sender. Thus, there is an element of privacy to this method of communication;  however  as  was  proved  in  previous  years  by  the  penet.fi  Finland   this  does  not  provide  anonymity.  Any  hacker, government  agency,  judge,  or  the  like  can  gain  access  to  said  list  and discover who the sender is. In the case of penet.fi, Scientology launched a lawsuit  of  copyright  infringement  against  them,  in  which  a  lower  court demanded they turn over the identity of its users .  Untraceable : If no list is maintained on the pseudonyms of users, then security  is  increased  exponentially…provided  you  are  willing  to  give  up two way communications with your party. Needless to say, this has some drawbacks,  and  is  in  some  ways  inferior  to  using  Tor  and or  PGP  to communicate. In addition, there is always the possibility of hacker attacks whereby once entry is gained upon the server, anonymity is compromised. Traffic-sniffers along with a host of other tools can also be used as a method of attack, as they compare and contrast the traffic emanating from the server .  Such  attacks  are  very  difficult  to  coordinate,  but  are  somewhat analogous to attacks within Tor and also Freenet, whereby if a sufficiently high  number  of  hostile  nodes  are  controlled  within  the  network,  then probability of stripping away layers of anonymity becomes more likely. In other words, if Law Enforcement for instance, controls all Tor relays, the long-term  effect  would  be  similar  if  they  had  control  of  most  nodes  on Freenet. Though they are admittedly vastly different technologies, they do share one common goal: hiding the true IP address of senders and recipients .  Mixmaster  techniques  however  attempt  to  thwart  such  subversive attempts by sending messages through several servers across the globe, in various countries of legality and law enforcement jurisdictions. It becomes exponentially difficult for hackers and or government entities to bunny hop from  server-to-server  across  the  globe  in  order  to  track  down  where  the original  sender  resided.  Thus,  it  goes  well  above  and  beyond  the  phrase   “don’t  put  all  your  eggs  in  one  basket”  and  is  more  akin  to  “many  eggs, many baskets”. Such is the skeletal framework of the onion-routing network Tor .   THINGS THAT BREAK ANONYMITY ON USENET  1 .  Giving out your real email address , even one from one of the “free” services such as Yahoo, Hotmail and the like, not only can, but *will* open you up to armies of spambots, guaranteed. Law enforcement too, if that’s your thing .  You  would  be  surprised  at  how  many  new  to  Usenet  are  under  the impression  that  these  free  email  services  are  somehow  foolproof  to  the legions  of  bots  and  cops  that  trawl  Usenet.  A  better  alternative:  use  a fictional name and temporary “Usenet-Only” email. If you have a website, your host probably offers you the ability to create throwaway accounts. Or, go with Anonymizer Nyms at https:  www.nyms.net for twenty bucks per year.  SharpMail,  Mailinator  &  Hushmail  are  also  excellent  options, however  if  you  want  anonymity  as  well  as  privacy,  remember  to  sign  up while  on  the  Tor  network,  not  the  open  web.  Also  remember  not  to  use credit cards or paypal, as it leaves a money trail. Better to use Bitcoins or a money order with no link back to you .  2 .  Dropping Personal Info . This is a big one, and one that is seen quite frequently  on  various  groups  where  flame  wars  erupt  over  issues  like political  campaigns,  privacy  and  even  some  mp3  groups   i.e. alt.binaries.sounds.  mp3.electronic .  Political  affiliations liaisons,  favorite restaurants,  bars,  musical  groups  and  the  like  can  lead  to  some  stalker building a profile on you, then hopping on Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn and keying in all the personal data you have given over the past six months.   Remember  that  whatever  is  typed  in  *any*  newsgroup  will  be  there  for years and years. Type in “labor” as “labour” or “color” as “colour”, and it is not difficult to discern your country of origin .  3  .   Leaving  messages  with  your  headers  clearly  visible  to  the  reading public.  By  using  various  search  tools,  they  can  see  every  message  you posted to Usenet, even if you used different nyms. This of course doesn’t occur if you use a service that strips away this information .  4 .  Signing up for a Usenet or VPN service using credit cards  R ealize that when you use your credit card to purchase anything like a vpn  virtual private network  or Usenet account, you are in fact leaving a money trail  straight  to  your  identity.  If  you  are  only  after  a  small  measure  of privacy,  such  as  wanting  a  Usenet  account  that  doesn’t  monitor log  your downloads, then a vpn is fine. However if it is anonymity you want, you will  have  to  sign  up  for  *both*  Usenet  as  well  as  the  vpn  service  using anonymous means, either by bitcoins, money order, or a prepaid debit card with no identifying information leading back to you .   TRUECRYPT, USENET, & PASSWORDS  I  n  all  of  this  talk  of  posting  rars,  pars  and  messages  out  in  the  open newsgroups, it would be a shame not to mention that you can also upload locked  containers  and  encrypted  volumes  to  Usenet  as  well.  The  main difference is that you have to have the Truecrypt  free  application installed, and  create  an  encrypted  container  with  messages  or  data  therein  before uploading it to a Usenet newsgroup. There are lots of different newsgroups that allow this and many that don’t. However you can use alt.binaries.test as a means to communicate covertly with another, or share files privately with another person. The encryption is actually fairly straightforward .  When you create the Truecrypt container with the data you want to send to someone else, you could then rar that one file  or files  and upload that. Then the only ones who would be privy to its contents are those with the keyfile,  which  you  could  email  to  them,  and or  the  password  to  the container .  The benefit of implementing Tor  for text groups, not binaries , Usenet and Truecrypt simultaneously is that you get the best of both worlds. You get the privacy that a vpn will allow, in addition to having the anonymity  different than privacy  of Truecrypt .  Always  check  the  newsgroup’s  FAQ  first  before  passwording  files  as many  groups  do  not  allow  it.  What  is  the  worse  that  can  happen?  Your Usenet  provider  will  be  inundated  with  complaints  and  they  will  revoke your posting privileges, which can be quite a cumbersome ordeal regardless of  whether  you  have  signed  up  anonymously  or  not.  If  in  doubt,  ask  the group, or post the word “passworded” or “pw” in the subject line. Groups   like alt.binaries.hdtv, which are flooded with passworded blu-ray files, will thank you for it .  There  is  nothing  quite  infuriating  as  downloading  a  50  gigabyte  Blu- Ray  disc  and  finding  out  that  it  won’t  extract  the  files  because  of  a password requirement. This is in addition to not having a membership to the forum where such a password was revealed in the first place .  R unning Usenet from a mounted Truecrypt image  O  ptionally,  you  could  create  an  encrypted  volume,  install  your  Usenet newsreader  into  that  container,  and  only  run  your  newsreader  upon  the mounting  of  said  container.  Just  be  aware  that  some  applications  like  to leave temp files in the system drive  C: , but most should have an option to set  such  a  directory   i.e.  set  it  within  the  encrypted  container  itself .  You will  have  to  mount  it  to  the  same  letter  directory  each  time  if  you  don’t want to change it every session, however it makes it very handy to secure communications privately between you and someone else without the entire newsgroup seeing what you are saying or trading .  There  may  be  an  instance  where  you  spent  a  lot  of  money  on  a  rare, vintage recording of an obscure album, and you don’t want anyone else in the  mp3  group  trying  to  make  money  off  it  on  eBay.  Solution?  Use Truecrypt to encrypt the mp3s. Rar them up with a password and upload to a newsgroup on Usenet .  leave  your  encrypted   If  you  are  in  a  country  that  makes  it  difficult  to  engage  in  free discussion online, such as Iran, China and the like, make sure that you do not  running  with  your  Usenet newsreader browser.  Doing  so  leaves  all  the  data  open  to  any  kind  of government entity that decides to raid your place of residence. Thus, if you are a regular poster in the group “alt.discussion.tibetan-freedom” it would be wise to not leave your PC running unattended at all, especially with a Truecrypt image mounted and in operation .  images    PGP  Y ou can also use PGP to encrypt messages to newsgroup as well. PGP is a free encryption application similar  however more complex  to Truecrypt. You can encrypt messages from one newsgroup to another, to any recipient you like, and they can in turn decrypt your message. It is more efficient to use PGP for the purposes of covert Usenet communication than it is to use Truecrypt, as the applications are meant for different security scenarios. It should be said that the pgp manual is not an easy read. It will take you some measure of effort to get your head around encrypting decrypting messages from  Usenet,  as  it  is  not  as  straightforward  and  newbie-friendly  as  say, Truecrypt.  It  is  worth  your  time  in  learning  however  if  you  want  to exchange encrypted messages with other PGP members on Usenet .  P GP-related newsgroups :  a lt.security.pgp  c omp.security.pgp.announce  c omp.security.pgp.discuss   c omp.security.pgp.resources  c omp.security.pgp.tech  Technical Sources on Cryptography, Security & Encryption www.iacr.org – Intern.

Newsgroups  that  employ  the  use  of  a moderator can have stark advantages over unmoderated groups, so much so that  the  group  attracts  far  more  attention  from  new  users  than  it  would without  such  moderation.  The  most  glaring  problems  with  a  totally unmoderated setting can be seen quite clearly within discussion groups on Freenet,  where  moderation  is  not  possible.  Individual  users  can  opt  to “ignore” all posts from certain users on their own, or create their own Frost discussion group with a private encryption key  that is, unless said key is leaked, in which the spammers engage in a full frontal assault on the group  .  On Freenet, spam, personal attacks, racism and hatred abound, however the responsibility is placed upon the individual to self-censor delete posts within  the  group.  On  Usenet,  even  moderators  have  been  unsuccessful  at completely eradicating spam and personal flame wars between members .  That  is  not  to  suggest  that  a  moderator  is  the  equivalent  of  a  Big Brother-like  censor,  however  it  makes  discussion  in  the  newsgroup  more honest  and  less  prone  to  those  who  like  to  derail  threads  into  off-topic discussions.  An  inherent  downside  to  being  a  regular  on  a  heavily moderated Usenet newsgroup is that tolerance becomes difficult to maintain .   After years and years of engaging in civil discourse in various groups, a user might find it a bit of a challenge to participate in a group that offers a more  relaxed  discussion  topic  structure.  In  one  of  the  mp3  newsgroups  electronic ,  untold  numbers  of  flame  wars  have  erupted  over  the  years concerning  new  users   as  well  as  old   who  would  post  collections  of ambient new-age artists .  Now,  there  are  other  mp3  groups  better  suited  for  collections  by,  for instance, Michael Stearns. Few electronic music fans would find him suited for  the  electronic  mp3  newsgroup,  however  every  now  and  then  a  new Usenet  user  would  show  up  and  mistakenly  post  to  the  group  his  latest offering. He would be summarily crucified with curses, flames and threats to inform his Usenet provider that he was spamming the group .  This type of intolerable attitude does more harm than good. There was also  many  uploads  done  of  artist  Steve  Roach,  whose  music  transcends several  different  genres:  new-age,  ambient,  trance  and  electronic,  yet  the uploader of said music was similarly cursed and vehemently badgered by long-term users .   WHICH VPN COMPANIES RESPECT  ANONYMITY?  I f you are a bit squeamish about accessing Usenet via your local ISP, you can always add an extra layer of privacy by subscribing to a vpn  virtual private  network   service  close  to  you.  There  are  a  plethora  of  good  vpn providers that will route your internet connection through them and provide ssl  secure socket layer  encryption so that your isp cannot see what you do online. Most all of them use similar technology to achieve this, and have comparable  speeds.  A  vpn  service  is  much,  much  faster  than  using  an onion-routing network like Tor, but not all of them will tolerate p2p usage. However, they will tolerate a Usenet account .  Unlike Tor, the vpn provider, which usually charges somewhere in the range of ten dollars per month for unlimited service  over and above what you pay your Usenet provider , WILL be able to see everything that you do through their connection, unless you route that connection through the Tor network. They are more tolerable to Usenet than they are P2P systems, as Usenet is less likely to incur a swarm of copyright lawyers sending them angry cease-and-desist letters .  Bottom line: some vpns will log your IP and some won’t. If they know your real name and address, you can be sure that law enforcement will  and any other type of law agency  with a subpoena. Sometimes not even that. It’s  a  hit  and  miss  game,  and  one  which  seems  entirely  dependent  on whether the provider keeps online logs of the traffic that goes through their portal. One popular vpn provider, BlackVPN, said this in their FAQ :   “A LTHOUGH WE DO NOT MONITOR the traffic, incoming or outgoing connections of our users we may assign users to a unique IP address and log which user was assigned which IP address at a given time. If we receive a copyright violation notice from the appropriate copyright holder then we will  forward  the  violation  to  the  offending  user  and  may  terminate  their account. We therefore ask our users not to distribute or transmit material which violates the copyright laws in either your country or the country in which our Service is hosted .”  T HE ABOVE DEFEATS the entire purpose of anonymity on the internet. A novice who didn’t know the difference between privacy and anonymity might  conclude  from  their  website  that  they  offered  complete  anonymity similar to what Tor offers, but that is clearly not the case at all. One has to be quite attentive to the fine details of the advertising on sites such as theirs to  see  if  any  logs  are  kept,  and  in  many  cases  they  will  not  reveal  such information unless you explicitly email them and ask. Interestingly, in 2011 the website TorrentFreak initiated a rather close examination of all of the vpn provider’s response to the question “Under what jurisdictions does your company  operate  and  under  what  exact  circumstances  will  you  share  the information you hold with a 3rd party ?”  Some  of  the  answers  were  expectantly  evasive,  and  others  were  quite  illuminating. One provider, CryptCloud, said  “W E DON’T log anything on the customer usage side so there are no dots to  connect  period,  we  completely  separate  the  payment  information. Realistically, unless you operate out of one of the ‘Axis of Evil Countries” Law Enforcement will find a way to put the screws to you. I have read the nonsense that being in Europe will protect you from US Law Enforcement, worked  well  for  HMA  didn’t  it?  Furthermore  I  am  pretty  sure  the  Swiss Banking veil was penetrated and historically that is more defend-able than individual privacy. The way to solve this is just not to log, period .”   T WO POINTS TO MAKE. One, the HMA  Hide My Ass vpn  incident he refers to involved a member of the hacker group Lulzsec, in which one of their  core  members  was  arrested.  Two,  he  cites  the  “Axis  of  Evil”,  but clearly they are not in one of those countries .  The  above  is  not  to  suggest  that  their  actual  service  is  less  than  that which  they  advertise,  but  the  distinction  between  privacy  and  anonymity often falls victim to the gnomes who work in the marketing department of said companies. CryptoCloud is located in…San Antonio, Texas, which has one of the most brutally unmerciful judiciary systems in the United States. If  a  federal  judge   or  Congress   wanted  the  identity  of  one  of  their customers, you can be sure that such information would be handed over in a heartbeat in order to avoid heavy day-to-day fines. If they are based in the US, they would *have* to have your personal identity information available in order to avoid bankruptcy by the federal government. To wit, this doesn’t necessarily  have  to  have  anything  to  do  with  terrorism,  cp,  spam  or counterfeiting. It could be as simple as running a file sharing server. The case involving Megaupload proves that true anonymity, at least that which is beyond the long arm of the law, is difficult to obtain, even if you reside in another  country.  Still,  it  is  worth  having  a  vpn  account  simply  because  it adds  an  extra  layer  of  privacy  to  your  sessions.  If  you  are  a  habitual uploader, you could do a lot worse than to pay ten dollars a month for an extra peace of mind .  The solution? Sign up to a vpn provider anonymously. There are several  providers who accept Bitcoins as payment .  http:  www.thebitcoinlist.com dp_internet vps-vpn     THE CLOUD  THE ENEMY OF ANONYMITY   I t goes  without  saying  that  men  are  voracious  collectors  of  many  things obtained online: mp3 collections, digital wallpaper, pdf files and the like. The term “cloud” has been given flighty and unwieldy definitions from one blogger to the next, as if the “cloud” is actually some impenetrable fortress in the digital sky where no moth or thief can break in and corrupt or steal. However  secure  you  feel  that  your  files  are  “in  the  cloud”,  it  is  perhaps worth remembering that whoever owns the “cloud”, owns your stuff. Thus, the  cloud  is  nothing  more  than  a  server  farm  with  hundreds  of  other people’s hard drives & servers, all digitally categorizing… your stuff .  No  longer  are  your  things  flying  under  the  banner  of  privacy  in  your own home, but rather you are subject to whatever litigious lawyer’s terms and conditions contract he has drummed up for the cloud provider. Be wary of  a  future  promised  where  your  data  is  at  the  whims  of  some  far  away server operator who gets to dictate which of your purchased music, movies and games gets “streamed” to your pc .  The  Windows  8  operating  system  has  a  feature  called  “SmartScreen” that  is  used  for  checking  the  validity  and  safety  of  files  before  they  are executed.  This  type  of  feature  was  first  implemented  in  Internet  Explorer and Windows Live Messenger to thwart malicious sites from being able to exploit people’s browsers .  Thus, verification and authentication were at the forefront of the feature, as it sought to prevent spam, malware and adware from infecting people’s computers. A good thing? Not for the majority of users, who found it rather annoying.  It  was  a  one-step-forward,  two-steps-backward  approach  that actually  hindered  the  internet  experience  for  millions  of  users  of  Internet   Explorer  as  they  attempted  to  go  to  links  that  were  not  dangerous  in  the least .  Enter  Windows  8,  in  which  the  SmartScreen  feature  tries  to  verify whether applications are “safe” to download or run on the operating system. It  checks  a  dynamic,  ever-changing  laundry  list  of  exploitable  URLs  that Microsoft  has  identified  as  harmful  for  end-users  on  pc  systems.  An additional problem with this is that it is cumbersome to turn off, and once done, results in consistent nagging from the operating system to re-enable it. Where it will be three to five years down the road? Will you have to have every app or file on your pc “authorized” by Microsoft’s servers before you can  execute  them?  What  about  cloud  content  and  streaming  legally purchased items to your own pc ?  For  the  uninitiated,  Microsoft  likes  to  assign  “download  reputation” points to digitally signed websites as well as programs. The problem with this is the same problem that manifests itself in anti-virus programs, namely that  a  lot  of  false-positives  get  thrown  in  the  user’s  face,  leading  to frustration and annoyance. At times, downloads will get frozen in Internet Explorer  9  as  the  downloaded  files  get  scanned.  There  is  no  option  in Internet Explorer 9 to switch it off and let end-users decide what security setting  to  implement.  Rare  files  constantly  get  falsely  flagged  as  being somehow  malicious  for  the  pc.  There  is  a  further  element  of  privacy intrusion for the SmartScreen feature. It collects data on every program you install  on  your  operating  system,  and  checks  to  see  if  a  valid  certificate exists on Microsoft’s “cloud”  i.e. their server  that verifies its “safety” for your operating system. It checks the hash of the program installer itself, and compares  it  to  a  list  at  Microsoft.  Think  about  how  many  programs  you have  installed  on  your  pc  that  are  related  to  privacy:  PGP,  Truecrypt, BitLocker, the installer your vpn provider emailed you, and perhaps even encrypted  keyfiles  to  your  hard  drive.  It  would  be  a  gold  mine  of  epic proportions for any hacker to get at such data .  Enter Usenet. As of 2017, it is relatively easy to hop on Usenet without having  to  jump  through  hoops  to  do  so.  When  you  download  data  from Usenet, it is typically decoded by your newsreader or NZB application and then saved to your hard drive. If you have an anti-virus installed, it most likely will have some element of checking each executable or installer that is downloaded to your pc, either by Usenet or some other variant of internet app. With the rush to maximize the use of cloud computing, however, the   responsibility of initializing these types of security settings is slowly being taken away from the end-user. What does this mean for Usenet? One of two things could happen .  1.  Eventually, users stream data off of usenet, which is then checked and “verified” through an intermediary cloud server, before being delivered to your hard drive  assuming you have one  .  2.  Usenet SSL will be prohibitively expensive and or reserved only for certain  groups  in  society   think  Government,  Intelligence,  etc .  Secure, anonymous  programs  like  PGP,  Freenet,  Truecrypt  and  the  like  will  be stigmatized and shunned by cloud servers for their inability to unmask and decrypt their true contents .  In  2010,  an  article  titled  “The  Death  of  the  Hard  Drive”  explored Google’s  persistent  momentum  towards  a  hard-drive-less  selection  of flagship  products,  all  citing  the  benefits  of  “cloud  storage”.  In  2012, Microsoft is gearing Windows 8 towards such a platter-less scenario .  “Stop worrying about when the hard drive in your computer will die.  Google wants to kill it permanently anyway .  The  new  Google  Chrome  operating  system,  which  was  unveiled Tuesday, as well as hints and suggestions from Apple and Microsoft, offers us a preview of the PC of the future. And it will come without that familiar whirring disk that has been the data heart of the PC for the past 25 years .  The  Chrome  OS  will  at  first  be  available  on  all-black  laptops  from Samsung and Acer. And because the new platform stores everything — files, applications, data bits and bytes, literally everything — on online servers rather  than  on  your  home  or  office  PC,  those  new  PCs  running  it  won’t require gobs of storage. In fact, they won’t require any storage at all . ”  Further  reasons  why  you  should  never  rely  on  the  Cloud  for  your  personal data backups .  1.  You are completely at the mercy of your ISP’s bandwidth cap . They stand  to  make  a  fortune  as  you  stream  your  own  personal  mp3s,  games, video  which competes with their own brand  and the like to your personal devices.  No  hard  drive  means  you’ll  be  streaming  quite  regularly. Bandwidth  caps  will  necessarily  cause  you  to  pay  more  for  products  that you have paid in full. Thus, true ownership becomes a misnomer. Instead, you  will  “rent”  the  products  you  buy  from  online  digital  sources.  Usenet prices will go up, as customers will not be able to afford the massive price spikes  in  bandwidth  costs.  One  of  the  hallmarks  of  Usenet  premium   providers  is  the  “unlimited”  package.  However  what  good  is  “unlimited” when  your  ISP  caps  your  connection?  Many  ISPs   especially  those  in Canada,  such  as  Bell  Sympatico   falsely  advertise  such  unlimited  options and speeds .  2.   US  jurisdiction  .  Most  of  the  server  backbones  related  to  cloud computing  reside  in  the  heart  of  the  USA.  That  means  your  private  data, while in the “cloud”, is subject to laws dictated by the US Congress and US Legislature.  What  is  quasi-legal  in  your  own  country  in  the  Ukraine,  or Timbuktu, might be dastardly illegal in the United States. Some government entities might insist that sites like Amazon not only cancel your account and delete your purchased files on their servers, but relay all personal subscriber information to them for proceedings in an American court. It has happened before.  There  is  also  the  opportunity  for  said  government  agencies   or hackers   to  intercept  your  data  streaming  down  to  you  to  verify  its authenticity.  For  your  own  good,  naturally.  Google  and  Microsoft  know what is best for you, right ?  3.  Encryption is allergic to Cloud Computing . You can bet the ranch that  almost  every  Cloud  Computing  server  operator  will  demand  to  see what is inside encrypted files in order to minimize the risk of being fined by the FCC or investigated by other alphabet agencies like the IRS  taxes , and FBI  fraud copyright . This is not necessarily the case today, in 2012, but you can be sure that if everyone has absolutely no choice but to upload their digital  purchases  to  their  servers,  they  will  want  to  see  the  contents  of everything since it resides on “their” server cloud. Google, Microsoft and Yahoo repeatedly scan personal emails in an attempt to better target their user’s browsing habits with targeted ads. It would be no different for mp3s, videos or love letters contained in encrypted Truecrypt volumes .  4.  It cheapens individuality . The collective group-think that is inherent in the pursuit to herd all the digital sheep into one pen is the anti-thesis of not only privacy and human rights on an individual level, it makes everyone dependent on a single system. In August 2012, Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple said at a Washington expose said :  “I really worry about everything going to the cloud. I think it’s going to be horrendous. I think there are going to be a lot of horrible problems in the next five years. With the cloud, you don’t own anything. You already signed it away. I want to feel that I own things. A lot of people feel, ‘Oh, everything   is really on my computer,’ but I say: the more we transfer everything onto the web, onto the cloud, the less we’re going to have control over it .”  And  Steve  would  be  correct.  If  Cloud  computing  takes  off  the  way Google  and  Microsoft  wants,  you  will  find  someone  else  in  some  other state, province, or country setting the times when you are allowed to access your own data, encrypted or not .  5.   George  Orwell’s  1984  .  Maybe  it  will  never  quite  happen  as  it  is alluded to in the book. Then again, no one could fathom that a Category 5 hurricane would wipe out New Orleans, or that 3000 people would die at the hands of 19 mangy terrorists on Sept. 11th, 2001. For several years now, the US has expressed the desire for an internet “kill switch” to deal with the less  than  desirable  in  our  society.  Today,  it  is  terrorists,  spammers  and identity thieves. Tomorrow, it is people who obviously have something to hide  if  they  implement  SSL  in  their  Usenet  setups  and  upload  Truecrypt volumes “to the cloud”. It is this kind of slow erosion of private property that forced the hand of Revolution in the 17th and 18th centuries .  T he above reasons are sufficient to put a shred of doubt insofar as Usenet usage  is  concerned.  Usenet  users  rely  on  their  physical  hard  drives  for storage of their data acquired from Usenet, and regardless of what that data is,  it  would  slowly  kill  the  Usenet  industry  if  users  had  to  “stream”  their files from their Usenet accounts with no place to securely store them. They also enjoy the privilege of not having their download logs kept by anyone. Such  is  certainly  not  true  of  most  torrent  trackers,  where  every  seed participating in the swarm reveals their ip address to anyone connected, day or night, for days and weeks on end .  D isregard Dictators, Acquire Privacy  To  reverse  the  heavy  tide  against  groupthink  and  giving  up  private ownership of your own files  on Usenet, or elsewhere , a stand needs to be taken now, and with more than simply our wallets. There was once a time back  in  the  1990s  where  the  purveyors  of  Usenet  did  not  have  to  worry about  their  posts  being  chiseled  in  stone  among  the  newsgroups  which would last for generations. Even one year retention for textual newsgroups   to  Usenet   Every  message  posted   was not that common, and five year retention for binaries was but a dream. Many Usenet users weren’t afraid to use their real names and real emails in messages.  At  the  time,  there  was  little  reason  to  be.  Now  however,  in addition to the ever-ominous threat of being stalked  and kidnapped killed   is  archived  by  Google  DejaNews Google  Groups   in  the  same  way  that  they  are  taking  high resolution  photos  of  every  nook  and  cranny  upon  the  earth  via  Google Earth.  The  aim  of  this  digital  push  towards  “the  Cloud”  seems  to  be  to minimize individuality as well as putting an end to privacy. The technology is  here  that  every  move  you  make  on  the  street  will  be  recorded  not  by security cameras sitting atop state buildings and banks, but by each other. Google has not only recorded every single message posted to Usenet within the last five years, it wants to do something eerily similar with their Project Glass product, in which users will be sold a pair of glasses with a built-in webcam  that  monitors  everything  around  it,  giving  immediate  data  about their  surroundings:  buildings,  restaurants,  museums  and  the  like.  Only  it won’t stop there. Eventually it will focus on people, as that is where the ad revenue streams lie. According to Google :  “ W e think Glass helps you share your life as you’re living it; from life’s big moments  to  everyday  experiences.  Today  we’re  kicking  off  what  we’re calling Glass Sessions, where you can experience what it’s like to use Glass while we build it, through the eyes of a real person, in real life. The first Glass Session follows Laetitia Gayno, the wife of a Googler, as she shares her story of welcoming a new baby, capturing every smile, and showing her entire family back in France every “first” through Hangouts .”  T rue Security lies with the Individual, not the State  W e may come to a point where it may be impossible to truly harbor any anonymity  at  all  on  Usenet  or  anywhere  else.  Users  who  don’t  have  the latest  “reality  enhancer”   which  just  so  conveniently  carries  every  data imaginable  about  your  birth,  health,  academic  &  employment  history    would suffer severe ostracization from peers  i.e. Facebook defriending, etc    As  anyone  with  a  RAID  hard  drive  setup  can  attest,  technology  gets smaller with each generation, and holds infinitely more data the further into the future you progress. There will come a point where you will not need to wear  glasses  to  record  and  upload  your  immediate  surroundings  to  the internet.  All  of  the  surveillance  will  inevitably  shrink  in  size  to  a  state where  your  naked  eye  will  not  notice  their  presence  at  all.  This  is  what happened with Usenet. No one knew back in the 1990s that everything we said  or  did  online  was  going  to  be  archived   archive.org   for  anyone  to peruse decades later .  Thus, we now censor ourselves on Usenet for fear of being reported to whatever authorities can punish us accordingly. Excessive data therefore, is actually the anti-thesis of freedom. Usenet SSL, VPNs, & Tor all provide a power to the end user that is slowly being shunned and minimized by those with the power to do so  i.e. Google, Facebook, . It is certainly not 100% integrated  into  society  yet,  but  it  is  coming.  To  foster  more  privacy  on Usenet,  we  need  more  anonymity.  People  need  to  be  free  to  speak  their minds and engage civil discussion without worrying about the powers that be  Google  pulling the strings of censorship. We will get to the point where we  will  be  accused  of  “being  up  to  no  good”  by  refusing  to  play  along. Have an encrypted volume and plan to cross the border? The border guard might ask you to decrypt. Refuse and they can confiscate your laptop for five days, making the trip fairly aggravating .  Will  it  one  day  be  considered  a  capital  crime  to  erase  some  negative thing  about  your  past  history  on  the  internet  without  some  government entity’s stamp of approval ?

I can relate to that as easily as you can. But these days Hell itself seems to have taken on an altogether foreign form that is wholly different than the medieval version. These days, many 'angels of light' profess to know what's good for us better than we do ourselves - which is sheer lunacy .  We're not sheep. We all see it. We're not blind. And some of us want to act as beacons of light in a sea of darkness rather than go "Baaaaa!" like sheep  to  the  bloody  slaughter.  We  want  to  lead  others  away  from  the slaughterhouse.  But  to  do  that  requires  a  specific  set  of  skills  no  college teaches .  Skills that will help us turn back the tide of Armageddon on individual sovereignty.  Because  let's  face  it,  attacks  on  privacy  have  increased  a thousand-fold. Every day new laws are passed that make privacy as rare as pink diamonds. In the future it just may come to be just as valued as pink diamonds. Do you want to hear your grandkids ask you what it was like in the old days when people weren't monitored 24 7 .  Right. Didn't think so . It's high-time we fought back and fought hard. If you've ever seen the Shawshank Redemption then you know what happens to weaklings - those that don't take action. They get raped again and again and again. Sooner or later you'll know what the meaning of this phrase is: "His judgment cometh and  that  right  soon".  It  means  war.  Wouldn't  you  rather  fight  before  the raping and pillaging starts? I would .  Judgment Day is already here. One cannot walk down the street without meeting a dozen street cams, and as an American Canadian citizen there are   times  when  I've  wanted  to  disappear  from  society  altogether.  Vanish  as though  I'd  slipped  Frodo's  elvish  cloak  over  my  neck  and  smoothed  that runic  ring  right  down  my  middle  finger  before  flipping  off  the  elites  in power .  But first, a little story . A  story  way  back  in  2001,  ancient  of  days  and  land  of  vampires  and  hooded hoodrats wielding double-bladed axes .  Living in close proximity to the housing projects of New Orleans, most days driving back from the University of New Orleans were uneventful. For the most part. Only Mardi Gras seemed to break the monotony along with eating soggy beignets  powdered donuts  on Bourbon Street .  Except for one day in particular while sweating in Manila-like traffic. On  that  day  something  terrifying  happened.  I  decided  to  take  a  shortcut which  turned  out  to  be  a  shortcut  into  trouble  for  no  sooner  that  I  sped towards  home  that  a  fourteen-year-old  girl,  black  with  ripped  jeans,  red sweatshirt and a nose that could put a bloodhound to shame ran in front of my beat-up Camaro while I drove 15MPH .  I slammed on the brakes and missed her hip by an inch. She slammed her fists on the hood of my car. Boom. Then she flipped me off real casual like this sort of thing happened every time it rained. I hopped out, furious, and proceeded to make sure she knew how damn close she'd come to a date with the grim reaper .  A cacophony of yelling ensued with every color of the rainbows. Soft swearing, hard swearing, and sweating  mostly me  as she matched every curse word with one better, more deviant, and fueled with twice the rage as though she'd been bred for no other reason than to unleash it all upon me on that fiery summer day. A vampiric Lady Macbeth, this thuggette was. But none of that really mattered to the law. No sir, what mattered was when I grabbed her arm and stabbed a finger into her face as I shouted to be more careful. I began to walk away .  Only I wasn't going anywhere . Her brother came running. A BIG brother wearing a dozen gold chains and carrying a chain big enough to tie a velociraptor. I swear the guy looked straight out of the A-Team. After that, her mother came screaming and what I presumed at the time was her grandmother, broom in hand  a witch? . I panicked  as  the  big  brother  threw  me  to  the  ground  as  mama  called  the cops. I remember expecting a black cat to come along any minute to scratch   my face to shreds. I was going down in flames though I was innocent of any abuse .  Fast-forward three weeks later and I'm having my ass handed to me by the  most  militant  feminist  judge  I'd  ever  laid  eyes  on.  A  real  manhater whose harpy-like claws seemed to grow the more I sweat. I had only one choice: Play along. So I kissed ass like I'd never in my whole miserable life. At the end of her screeching rant, I ended up getting off on a technicality. The police had screwed up somewhere, it seemed .  My record was as clean as a babe's arse. Clear as as crystal... or so I thought until later that year a detective came knocking. It seemed that the little  girl  had  disappeared  and  to  my  horror,  found  he  knew  everything about me. Things that were not in the court transcript. Things I'd done were recorded by various cameras set up around the city. The entire city seemed to be turning a shade Orwellian .  "Talk  to  me,"  he  said  smiling  with  that  shiny  badge  gleaming.  I frowned. Talk to the cops? "Yeah," he replied. "Talk to me or get put on the sex offender's list for abusing that little girl ."  Abuse ? I clammed up. Granted, I was native, but not stupid. He ended up letting me go after throwing down every threat imaginable. After that I wanted to vanish even more, and as I would later learn, I wasn't the first to go through such an ordeal .  Up until that point, I'd always trusted the police, or for that matter any kind  of  higher  authority  in  government.  I  trusted  the  media.  I  trusted newspapers. I trusted juries. About the only thing I never trusted were the palm readers who always set up shop around the French Quarter .  Well, no longer . From that point on, I swore to myself I'd learn how to be invisible, or die trying. True, I escaped the sex offender registry by keeping my mouth shut.  Others  have  not  been  so  lucky.  I've  heard  another  author   Wendy McElroy  relate a similar story :  "Last summer, an Illinois man lost an appeal on his conviction as a sex offender  for  grabbing  the  arm  of  a  14-year-old  girl.  She  had  stepped directly in front of his car, causing him to swerve in order to avoid hitting her .  The 28-year-old Fitzroy Barnaby jumped out his car, grabbed her arm and  lectured  her  on  how  not  to  get  killed.  Nothing  more  occurred.   Nevertheless, that one action made him guilty of “the unlawful restraint of a  minor,”  which  is  a  sexual  offense  in  Illinois.  Both  the  jury  and  judge believed  him.  Nevertheless,  Barnaby  went  legal proceedings that ended with his name on a sex offender registry, where his photograph  and  address  are  publicly  available.  He  must  report  to authorities.  His  employment  options  are  severely  limited;  he  cannot  live near schools or parks "  through  years  of   Here  I  was  thinking  I  was  the  only  guy  that  had  experienced  such  a horrific day. The absurd part is not even that it happened. It's that it is never forgiven.  It's  never  put  in  the  past  where  mistakes  are  buried.  They  are broadcasted forever, branded over and over into our memories. Forgiveness  i.e.  granting  your  past  actions  invisible  to  everyone  but  you  and  the Almighty  is outlawed .  Well. This book aims to reverse that trend. It aims to give you back your  privacy and if you need it, invisibility .  You don't want newspaper reporters sticking mics in your face before you've  had  your  day  in  court  do  you?  That  happened  to  me.  I  remember feeling like I'd killed everyone's favorite rock star though I'd never set foot anywhere near the concert .  Think on how your life would change if any of the following happened    Someone uses your unsecured WiFi to threaten the President .   A hacker steals your credit card to purchase Russian child porn using  to you :  proxies .    You hear sirens just as your phone rings. You pick up to hear a news journalist asking for an interview since you were the last person to see the Governor  alive  at  the  Beau  Chene  Golf  and  Racquet  Country  Club   who was later found dead in a pool of blood in the restroom - the same you used !      The  powers  that  be  are  coming  after  you  for  child  support--without allowing you to see your own children. You try to visit Canada to "get away from  it  all"  for  a  while,  when  you  are  arrested  at  the  border.  Things  get worse when they find a few "manga" comics in your back seat. Manga that is  illegal  in  Canada  but  not  the  USA.  Chaos  ensues.  They  rip  your reputation apart in the name of the law .    Your ten year old brother jokes to his pals on the school yard that he has a shed full of Rambo-like grenades and a few barrels of gunpowder. A   girl overhears. She snitches. The cops arrest him  not kidding  but later let him go. Years later, that report shows up when he tries to join the Marines. He is rejected . Yes, This really happened to a relative in Louisiana. And that's not to say Louisiana is any better or worse than any other state where hysteria can run amok and drag you along for the ride. The fact is, I'll show you how to prevent crap like this from happening no matter which country you are in .  If you are ever investigated, the authorities will likely tear your place apart looking for anything from which to build a solid case to hand to the prosecutor.  Who  knows  what  your  situation  might  be  at  that  time.  You might  need  to  go  away  for  a  while  to  strategize  with  attorneys,  maintain your  business,  speak  to  family,  move  assets,  etc.  It  is  difficult  to  do  that from a jail cell .  The USA now has a "guilty until proven innocent" legal system. You are  not  innocent,  but  I  will  teach  you  to  gain  that  precious  commodity called TIME which you can use to gather resources to defend yourself .  Resources that go well with becoming invisible . You will learn : 1.  How to be anonymous offline as well as on . 2.  How to use your surroundings to lessen risk, special forces style . 3.  How to detect when you are being data-mined: How to hide where you went to school, where you've lived, whom you've loved, whom you did not. Your shopping habits, dating habits, political affiliations. You get the picture .  4.  How to look like a small fish and not a BIG FISH .  B ut this is just the beginning .   BURN NOTICE & SKIP TRACERS  B urn Notice is one of my favorite TV shows. I don't watch much TV but I do if that show is on. I'd stop to watch it even if a mugger came in and stuck me in the ribs before making off with my wallet. It's that grand. It's thrilling. It's top notch espionage and underground battle-of-the-wits style American James Bond. Sort of like True Lies, but with better looking agents .  The 'burn notice' itself usually comes from an intelligence agency, but can be from any alphabet agency really. It doesn't even need to be on paper. You  can  get  'The  Call'  while  on  a  mission  in  Iran  or  Brazil  or  Eastern Europe.  What  happens  is  this:  The  CIA  calls  you  up  and  at  the  most inopportune moment tells you they wish to 'wash their hands of you '. You're done. You're cooked. You're career as an agent is finished . They  cut  the  umbilical  quick  and  every  connection  to  an  agent  is severed  in  true  Mission:  Impossible  fashion.  And  all  for  what,  you  ask? Easy. So they can save face. Any agent has no idea what he did  well maybe a  few  might  have  an  idea   but  he  knows  he  has  no  work  history,  no connections, no support and no cash. Poor guy is BURNED. For good .  Well, sort of. If some bigwig at the FBI wants info on him, he can get it from said agency if he has enough pull and the person is a high-value target .  As I watched this show for years I kept thinking: Wouldn't it be great to give yourself your own 'Burn Notice'? Disappear from society altogether? Get a fresh start with new name, new job, the works, in some country where pretty  Filipinas  fall  out  of  coconut  trees  as  you  sit  on  a  beach  drinking margaritas ?   Well  okay,  maybe  not  that  extravagant.  Perhaps  it's  more  simple  for you.  You  want  to  keep  the  collector's  off  your  back  while  you  grow  a business to pay back your student loans. Start a new relationship. Get away from an abusive wife wielding a double-bladed axe .  It's all rather easy to speculate but difficult to implement. We like our safety nets. We like our 'safe jobs', and a lot of guys don't like losing money in online ventures. So they play it safe. They refuse to take risks. Then one day when they need to leave the country, they can't because they took no action .  Then there are skip tracers to worry about . Skip tracers? What're those, they ask? From wiki . Skip  tracing  tactics  may  be  employed  by  debt  collectors,  process servers, bail bond enforcers  bounty hunters , repossession agents, private investigators, attorneys, police detectives, and journalists, or by any person attempting to locate a subject whose contact information is not immediately known. Similar techniques have also been utilized by investigators to locate witnesses in criminal trials .  Before we deal with skip tracers, a word of caution: NEVER fake your own death or disappearance since doing so will bring more heat on you than if you shot Dirty Harry in the ass. Even a simple disappearance can lead to a  statewide  manhunt,  or  womanhunt  in  the  case  of  Leanne  Bearden  who, after a 2-year globe-trotting vacation, vanished one hot Texas day .  "I'm going for a walk. Be back in one hour!" were her last words. She hung herself from a tree in a wooded area close to her in-laws home. Police helicopters, dogs, and even state troopers spent hundreds of hours looking for her  no suicide note , fearing she'd been snatched and kidnapped. I sat stunned at all the Youtube comments calling for the husband's crucifixion, and all without any evidence he'd done anything .  Don't do this . Don't  kill  yourself  over  bad  debts.  Don't  do  it  over  unemployment  apparently why the woman hung herself . Don't do it over a failed marriage  taken the Red Pill, yet? . Don't fake your own death and try to buy fake IDs  from  Craigslist.  If  you  try  to  cross  the  Canadian  border  with  a  fake passport  because we know how nice those border officers are on the Fourth of July with a thousand Canadian-made cars in line to shop , that one guard can  ban  you  for  life.  Ask  George  Bush  what  happened  when  one  tries  to cross with a DUI record. He had to get a waiver. But more on this later .   Instead what we want to do is plant false leads that end in Nowhereville for any Skip Tracer hot on your trail. That's what the next few chapters are about.  Getting  somewhere  while  leading  any  skip  tracer  or  other investigator to believe they're on a wild good chase .   A WORLD WIDE WEB OF DECEIT  Y our most prized tool  in  seeking  information  is  also  your  enemy's  most prized tool for seeking your loss of freedom be it handcuffs, garnishments or even asset forfeiture, to which the ATF has turned into a profit-industry. Your neck is out there online as naked as the day you were born .  Being  the  smart  cookie  you  are,  you  know  it  isn't  rocket  science  to vanish online. Lots of guides explain how to cloak your identity using all kinds of tools. Tor for starters. Most computer literate people know of it. Then there's chatting on Freenet. That's not so easy. Then there are VPNs that  hide  your  IP  address.  You  can  even  chain  proxies  to  post  encrypted messages  on  Usenet  with  them  if  you  know  how  to  buy  services anonymously .  But  those  guides  rarely  tell  you  what  pops  up  when  a  seasoned  skip tracer simply keys in your home phone number or alias into a search engine and starts calling every person you've ever known. That's the part even the encryption experts forget about: That which is right under their very noses. Tracers, like collections, will harass everyone on your city block about you. And boy do they lie. They lie with more skill than the Devil himself !  Aliases  L et's talk about aliases. I'd bet good money that you or your kids use the same alias on Facebook and Twitter that you do on Usenet and The Pirate Bay, or some combination thereof. Maybe something cool like Windsong.   You'll switch it up a bit on other sites, maybe go by Windsinger or some such.  Oh  there  might  be  an  extra  number  or  two  here  and  there,  but  we humans are creatures of habit. We don't like hard work and having multiple *different* aliases for every social media... well some of us just cannot be bothered because that's too much work for us to do. Mistake numero uno .  To prove a point to one of my beautiful nieces in Louisiana, I had her type in a nic she uses on Twitter and P2P. It wasn't just her P2P messages that  popped  up  but  those  she'd  typed  on  Usenet  as  well  -  messages  from long dormant times when she was a wee pre-teen. As it turned out, Google indexes Usenet messages from decades ago. I almost felt bad for showing her Usenet at such a young age. And believe me, most of us Usenet guys back then never in a million years believed we'd have 7 year retention rates offered by Usenet farms .  But the real danger was using that same nic across the board on several  social media sites .  One  website  allows  you  to  look  up  people  based  on  name  alone.  We found a dozen, yes... a dozen Americans in the south with the exact same name as her but not one with the same nic. Anywhere in social media .  The nic? LinuxGrl . Any Skip Tracer worth their salt might think she has a nerd gene  she does . She loves coding C++, Java, too. She loves The Matrix and adores the little blonde hacker geek from Jurassic Park like a long lost sister. Any Skip Tracer would find her messages sprawled across the net on every tech forum known to man. She's quite open about her age, too .  When we looked at all the info, it lead a trail right to her bedroom. So many years and so many clues build quite the profile. She freaked out as any red-headed teenager would but only because she feared they might find out which boy she has a crush on .  "Ye gods!" I snapped. "That's all you're worried about?" To which she  replied, "What else could happen ?"  We were even able to find out from these messages where she meets her fellow high school geeks for PvP Warcraft and Fallout marathons  the pen and paper game, not the PC RPG  .   IP ADDRESS SEARCHES  B  e  cautious  about  skipping  privacy  protection  if  you  have  an  online business.  Skip  Tracers  can  execute  a  simple  online  WHOIS  search  that often reveals who owns the domain, which would be you . They may even gain your address. If they cannot find the domain owner outright, they may be  able  to  follow  clues  you've  left  in  your  posts.  But  you'd  never  be  so careless as to leave your real name, right ?  Right. But the problem isn't you. The problem is your relatives . Your friends  .  Your  business  associates  .  Your  ex-lovers.  A  clever  Skip  Tracer will lie to fish the info out of them .  And they always sugar-coat it, appearing as someone who wants to help you  -  an  angel  of  light  and  niceness  and  puffy  clouds:  A  prospective employer. A lawyer looking to give away inheritance money  yeah, right . A movie director who wants to offer you the role of a lifetime .  You may hear a lot of affiliate marketers say that it doesn't matter if you have  WHOIS  protection  or  not,  but  I  disagree.  If  you  want  to  shield yourself, and by extension, your freedom  the secret to happiness btw , then you need to not leave a money trail to your front doorstep .  The Courts  G ot a speeding ticket recently? That will show up in a public court record. And those records are not difficult to get. Anything that happens on public, tax-funded  roads  is  often  available  to  any  Joe  Blow  who  wants  it.  That   includes  fender-benders,  drug  busts  and  well,  anything  that  involves  you pleading to a judge .  A big danger is privately owned property. That is, property that can be taken away from you by the IRS, the Dept of Education, your Uncle Frick who works for the EPA .  Loose  lips  sink  ships.  Who  else  knows  about  the  land  but  you? Relatives? Friends? How easily can a Skip Tracer contact them about your land--which they so desperately want to buy for a million dollars  oil ? ?  Worse, you might be tempted to put this land on a bank loan application as  collateral.  Don't  do  that  either.  Such  things  are  available  to  the  public eye. Not the account numbers mind you but your name and address. If you want to be invisible, don't go taking your elvish cloak off in Mordor where any green-skinned orc can sniff you out and ambush you .   KNOWLEDGE IS POWER  K nowledge is power. Or rather, knowledge is potential power. That's the crux of it alright as collectors and skip tracers must rely on your ignorance. In fact they prefer you not know your rights so as to better fuel whatever fear tactics they employ .  Let's  say  you  see  the  writing  on  the  wall  and  in  six  months  you  will default on a student loan. You feel helpless. You know the collectors will be coming. You know the phone will be ringing. You know they will be calling your employer to harass you and your friends, your family, so what can you do ?  Allow me to sound like a broken record: Knowledge is power. They rely on your ignorance and assuming your lender won't work with you and your Ombudsman is fond of Houdini acts, there are a few steps you can take to minimize grief .  If your name address is scattered over social media like pepper on eggs, then you need to remove it before the slime-skinned collectors get a hold of it .  -  S  tudy  the  FDCPA  like  your  livelihood  depends  on  it   which  it  does . Know  what  they  can  get  away  with  and  what  they  can't.  Remember, knowledge is power. If you wield it, they will respect it  - Check your aliases. Are they the same on every social media website? Is your phone number visible? What about your email? Can a collector or   any stranger for that matter view your private info on Facebok? How about Twitter? LinkedIn ?  -  This  above  all:  ask  for  any  debt  or  claim  to  be  given  in  writing. Student loans? Ask for a copy of the promissory note. Often they will NOT have this information. They will give every deadbeat excuse in the world so as not to send it and believe me friend I have heard that ALL :  "We don't have to send that."  A lie   "We'll send it next week."  Another lie. If that's true, ask her to send you  a screenshot    "You need to setup an automated payment plan first."  BIG LIE   Always  contest  the  debt  and  NEVER  send  a  payment  until  you  GET  THAT promissory note or bank loan with your signature .  A lso, look into these and know what they cannot do  Gramm-Leach Act - Legislation that limits the abuse they can leave on your message machine. Many collectors don't pay heed to this at all. Call them on it !  F air Debt Collection Practices Act  T elephone Consumer Protection Act  T he double-edged sword in all of this is that saying: "Please do not call me again!" This does not work. You must issue this in writing to the bank. It's called a no-contact order. Sometimes it works, sometimes not .  A  close  friend  of  mine  happened  to  secure  a  lucrative  deal   by  her standards anyway  as an extra on a movie set in Los Angeles. He was an extra with a few speaking lines. Not much to brag about down at Igor's bar but it was a good amount for a day's work: $500. As luck would have it, her effort  to  pay  down  her  student  loan  went  awry.  The  collector  called  her   mother and a few friends and managed to get the number of someone on the set. Snakes are clever !  You can imagine what happened . The whole set had to stop filming to allow her to answer that stupid call. So never underestimate what those hucksters will do to your reputation, and prepare accordingly .   HOW TO CREATE AN ANONYMOUS BANK  ACCOUNT  O  ne  wintery  night  when  few  were  paying  attention,  the  Canadian Parliament decided to pass a budget bill containing the single most wicked act of treason in western history .  It's name is FATCA  Short for FATCAT . Developed by Obama, Harry Reid  and  Nancy  Pelosi  in  2010  with  a  fully  compliant  Democratic Congress, it's workings are the kind of thing a superpower might enact in a sanctions bill against a terrorist state like Iran or North Korea, certainly not Canada. And when you get right down to it, it is an act of financial war - mandating  every  bank  in  Canada  fork  over  the  financial  information  of *any*  Canadian  with  US  citizenship.  It's  passed  to  the  Canadian  Tax Service, then to the IRS - the same who demand all Canadians with U.S. citizenship to file and or pay taxes to the US despite not ever living there .  Things  like  this  are  a  slippery  slope  to  civil  wars  and  revolutions. Worse, the Canadian Parliament did not resist in selling out it's own people. One politician in Parliament claimed "We had no choice as we had thirty days to decide or face a 30% penalty on all investments in the USA ."  In other words, they were "just following orders ." Where've we heard that before ? At any rate it seems that Big Brother is alive and well and Judas himself could not have orchestrated a sharper backstab. A few Canadians have filed a  federal  lawsuit  to  be  sure,  claiming  it  to  be  unconstitutional   it  is ,  but even if the suit is successful and the law overturned, banks will not be in a hurry to revert their systems as it is so expensive .  But make no mistake: If you are a US citizen, they want to know so as to rat you out to the IRS for not paying taxes in two countries. In essence,   for  not  being  a  nice  little  lemming  with  wrists  outstretched.  This  is  a problem for those who love freedom, and by extension, happiness, to say nothing about those who love anonymity .   HIDING ASSETS  I  f  you  want  to  hide  valuables  from  a  spouse  and  do  not  mind  tangible assets,  look  into  opening  an  anonymous  deposit  box  overseas.  It  is  still technically an "account" but Das Safe , located in Vienna, does a good job of  preserving  your  privacy  and  demand  no  ID  from  you.  Bear  in  mind though that if you lose your key, it's tough to retrieve another one .  Also  be  aware  that  anything  sitting  in  an  overseas  vault  is  not convenient. It is time-consuming to get it, sell it, convert it to gold or cash and retrieve it and all paying attention to leaving no financial trail. But then financial anonymity has never been cheap. You have to weigh the needs of an emergency to your need of invisibility .  O ther Options :  You can go the Bitcoin route and buy currency, but you will face stiff fees as Paypal is a high-risk method when the two are paired. And there is a tough learning curve if you're not good with computers. Nevertheless, there are guides that can walk you through it but Bitcoins are not anonymous by themselves .  Bitcoin  Ptshamrock   H  ere  you  can  buy  an  anonymous  debit  card  and  other  items.  They  are legitimate and have been around for years, however are not cheap, nor are they perfect. Blackhat marketers sometimes use them .  Ocra  O cra outfits offshore investments, trusts and foundations for, as they term it,  "Wealth  Protection"  and  "International  Business".  You  may  find  they offer something you need .  As  you  can  see,  there  are  downsides  to  just  about  every  facet  of anonymous  financial  accounts.  What  we  have  not  discussed  is  accessing any of those accounts online. This is dangerous and should be avoided. But  sigh  there are times when you simply must get access to an online account and be secure doing it. Here's how :  1. A VPN  Virtual Private Network . Trial versions abound. You need this  to  shield  yourself  from  search  engines, not the  government.  For  that, use Tor. Buy the VPN, the price of which is usually under ten bucks, then install Tor .  2. Tails Tor downloaded to a memory stick if you're truly paranoid. My Tor  book  gives  details  if  you  want  lengthy  examples  but  this  above  all: never reveal any personal data .  3.  Anonymous  Debit  Card,  Loadable.  If  you  load  the  card  with  cash,  you must not do so within your own town .   STUDENT LOANS  E  nglish  majors,  perhaps  more  than  any  other  major   except  Gender Studies , make up the bulk of criticism for student loan debt. It goes well beyond  snide  comments  made  at  the  office.  Politicians  have  come  out slandering liberal arts majors in general but you never hear them criticize STEM degrees, nor do they mention how brutal those programs are when Professor Punjab wants to shrink his incoming Biology class by 85% to free up some research time. We’ve all heard the usual questions .  "Why did you not study chemistry or engineering? Or go for an MBA?  Maybe an M.D.?" they ask you .  Often,  these  stone-throwers  neglect  to  do  any  research  on  these  other STEM degrees. If they did, they'd realize that they take out just as much, if not  more,  debt  than  their  liberal  arts  brethren.  Automation  coupled  with outsourcing  is  making  every  degree  irrelevant,  some  faster  than  others. Even medical students are graduating with $200,000 in student loan debt. That's debt that is neither dischargeable in bankruptcy nor easy to pay off as they :  -  Garnish  your  wages   but  not  before  slandering  you  to  your  work  colleagues    - Seize your assets - Crucify your relationship with your employer Now it is everyone's problem . The main problem students face, and one we will eradicate, is this: how does one work off the debt without being terrorized? Better yet, how does one make a fresh start when they've absolutely exhausted all options save that of stringing themselves up from the nearest tree ?   In  short,  how  to  disappear  at  least  temporarily  so  you  can  grow  a business that enables the paying off of said debt? Any businessman will tell you,  debt  will  kill  any  business.  You  might  be  chuckling  to  hear  this, wondering if such a thing is even possible for an English major .  "Pay off a student loan to the tune of a hundred grand by... writing, you  say? Impossible !"  It most certainly is possible. I know this because my brother did it, but not  before  teaching  him  how  to  keep  those  baying  bloodhounds  at  bay. Knowledge is 80% of the battle. That is, how to fight back. I showed him. He showed them . And I will show you .   TAX OFFSETS  U nless you live in Canada, any federally defaulted student loan will likely result  in  a  tax  offset  by  the  IRS  if  it  isn't  dealt  with.  Cutting  off communication works only if you've got leverage. If not, they take your tax return unless you happen to be self-employed  more on that later . Worse than this is when you are garnished and get a tax offset. Let's first discuss what legal options you have .  A few points : - Your spouse can have her tax return taken as well even if she did not cosign the loan. She can however file an injured spouse form and send it to the IRS. Not the best option .  - You can challenge the offset using this site . https:  www.myeddebt.com borrower topReviewNavigation It's difficult and for this to be successful you need to prove validity as to  why the offset should not occur. Here are some valid reasons :  1.  You've already paid the debt prior to them kickstarting the offset 2.  You're disabled  not temporarily   3.  You've recently claimed bankruptcy 4.  You view the debt as unenforceable Real problems arise when people put off challenging it. They ignore all warning  signs  and  only  at  the  end  realize  how  serious  it  is.  Therefore, prevention is paramount if we want to avoid collection agencies .  P revention: The Department of Education's Worst Enemy   Be  aware  that  if  you  try  to  outsmart  the  Dept  of  Education,  you  will have a tough time of establishing a reputation for your business if you want to expand  i.e. borrow money . Anonymity will be your calling card, and you  will  always  be  looking  over  your  shoulder  in  the  USA.  Problem  is, creditors you ask for money don't like anonymity. It may get so difficult that you are tempted to leave for Canada, either to take up a student visa, work visa or to seek permanent residency there .  Other digital nomads have done this and succeeded. They're all over the place in every sense of the word. Some work for Odesk and eLance while others  go  the  affiliate  route,  but  not  without  jumping  major  hoops.  That should  be  the  last  resort  since  you  don't  want  something  preventing  you from using your passport .  That said, let's discuss how to prevent an offset so we don't get into that  very long minefield of red tape .  Consolidation  A ssuming you don't qualify for forgiveness, the Direct Loan program can be your ticket out of this mess if you're not too deep in the hole. One option is to group your loans together which would take your loan out of default and put it in good standing. The other is IBR, or Income Based Repayment . If  you're  making  pennies  working  at  7-Eleven,  then  you  will  likely  pay nothing.  Nada.  Zero.  But  the  time  to  get  approved  can  take  one  to  three months. You can do the math at the link below :  h ttp:  www.ibrinfo.org  calculator.php  T he other thing to remember about consolidation is that your interest rate must factor into any decisions you make. My advice is to wait until you are out of school before accruing additional loans by consolidation - when the interest rate is locked at a low amount .   Rehabilitation  M  any  students  apply  for  rehabilitating  their  loans,  which  takes  nine months. Talk with your lender to work out a payment plan. When the rehab process is complete, default status is changed to good standing. At issue is this:  students  are  eligible  for  taking  out  massive  student  loans   again!  which does not help the situation .  Forbearance : This should be the last bullet in your holster. If all of the above fails, you can put your loan into forbearance. This helps stave off the vampiric  collectors  but  with  a  terrible  price:  excessive  interest!  We're talking biblical revelatory interest here, called capitalized interest that will kill any business before it gets off the ground. Then there are fees the lender likes to tack on. Debt slavery is alive and well .  Those are the legal ways to deal with student loans . The shady way is to just let them default. If you go this route, they will call and harass you dozens of times per day. They will hound your relatives and friends and colleagues. It will show up on a credit report for a potential employer to see. And that's not even the most absurd part. Want to know what it is ?  Okay, here it is: They're not really interested in you paying them back. They're  interested  in  you  putting  them  back  into  deferral forbearance  so they can charge you insane interest  which they fleece the taxpayers to pay  .  Bottom  line:  Pay  something.  Anything.  Even  fifty  dollars  a  month. Heck even ten dollars a month by money order is something traceable you can show a judge, heaven forbid it should ever come to that .   SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS  I f you've ever spent time googling your own name, you know how easy it is to find other people with the same name as you. I googled my own and found a pepper-bearded lawyer in Tennessee with the exact same name that I have. Same age. Same name. Different looks and different jobs. I write for a living. He sues people for a living .  But we have different social security numbers. He probably uses his for just about everything under the sun, including applying for work before he went lawyering up. I don't. Reason being is that I don't like where I sleep and fart being known by every red-headed harpy named Betty who works in HR. So to that I've used a fake address for as long as I remember. When I didn't have the luxury of using my own, I used my friend's address .  As any privacy-minded man should .  Employment  B  ack  in  2008  when  Obama  took  office  and  the  economy  nose-dived,  I applied in person to some 600 jobs to supplement my income. I must have lost a hundred pounds hitting the pavement. The overwhelming response in 98% of the jobs I applied for ?  Apply online . It  mattered  not  what  establishment  I  went  to.  FedEx.  Home  Depot. Publishers. Newspapers. They all said the same thing: Apply online. Apply online. Apply online. I heard those two words so much that I began to see   them  in  my  digital  alarm  clock,  blinking  like  some  countdown  on  a thermonuclear device. Worse was the fact that many asked me for my social number  before  being  hired.  I  found  it  all  appalling  and  disrespectful  of someone's privacy .  Never, ever give this out before you are hired. Doing so will set you in the crosshairs of any collectors PIs out there looking to gun you down. The two jobs I did secure hired me despite that I'd given an obvious fake social number prior to hiring  1234-56-7890 . The interviewer  a man  could have cared less though I did fork over my real one when they said, "Welcome aboard ."  Things to Avoid  U niversities  When I attended the University of New Orleans, the SSN was used for nearly  everything.  Checking  out  books.  Scheduling  classes.  Asking  for grade  transcripts.  I  worked  in  the  Financial  Aid  office  and  there,  too,  I found  few  students  were  referred  to  by  name.  You  were  just  a  number.  I would  call  up  to  schedule  an  appointment  and  the  first  thing  they'd  say, before anything else :  "What's your social ?" Pathetic . Even more pathetic was that anyone who worked in the UNO system had  access  to  this  number.  It  mattered  not  how  secure  the  system  was against identity theft because any schmuck who'd just transferred in could work in any department he wanted as long as the work-study money was there. Free money, they called it .  Taxpayer money . Be careful about throwing this number around like monopoly money .  Class Rosters  T his was another biggie .   On  my  way  to  the  restroom,  I  happened  to  notice  one  professor  had every student's SSN beside their name on the class roster. I began to wonder why  this  was,  and  if  other  professors  did  the  same  for  all  other  classes. Sadly, there wasn't anything I could really do about this at the time .  Computer Labs  Back when we used a VAX system at UNO  around the time Netscape became popular , we had to use our SSN to login. This same login scheme was how one Harvard student was busted in 2014 when he used Tor to send a bomb threat... out of sheer boredom! Not too bright .  The other threat is that students walking by you in a lab setting can see you type it out. Heck they can even see you from behind since in many labs the chairs are fitted close together to accommodate a sea of new students every semester. Avoid this if you can by logging in from your own laptop .  Grades Listed Outside Class  I was a pre-med gunner before I got smart and quit. In my freshman chem class,  grades  were  posted  outside  the  classroom  in  the  hall,  listed  with everyone  else's  social  security  number.  I  watched  in  disarray  as  many  a student slid his finger down the list to see his grade. If I was the nefarious type,  it  would  have  been  a  no-brainer  to  match  the  kid  with  the  social number and execute the beginnings of a clever identity theft scheme .  I scratched mine out with a Sharpie marker .  Dorms  M  y  first  semester  of  college  had  me  and  my  brother  lugging  my  few meager possessions up six floors of my dormitory. But prior to that, I had to check in. Only checking in was done *outdoors*, just outside the entryway . I had to present my driver's license to show I wasn't some old cajun bum dropout from culinary school to shack up with the girls going to and fro.   They  checked  my  name  on  a  paper  roster  to  see  which  room  I  had  been assigned  I requested a single room... they laughed . And there next to my name was my SSN. Wonderful, I thought. That number again .  There have been a few incidents with SS numbers being stolen over the  years and used for all kinds of mischief overseas .  Now you might be thinking, why would someone go to all that trouble? Steal someone else's social security number so they can do... what exactly ? Well, I'll tell you. If you're a criminal, the best thing in the world is to steal  someone  else's  identity.  For  this  reason,  you  should  never,  ever  use someone else's number. That other person can be on the FBI's Most Wanted list and the day you find that out will be too late without them charging you with identity theft yourself .   CHANGING YOUR NAME  Changing Your Name Stateside  C hanging your name isn't difficult. It's getting a new SSN that's a pain. It isn't like reaching into a bag of Skittles. More often than not, it's done by a court order. The requirements are beyond strict, placing the burden of proof on you, the ever law-abiding citizen... One being that you must prove to a court  of  law  that  you  are  in  danger  of  losing  your  life.  And  you  need  to prove it, not just say it. This might be an abusive spouse who tried to kill you  or  the  FBI's  Witness  Protection  Plan  or  some  such,  but  the  social security number will likely stay with you without this .  Here is what the government says about getting a new SSN . We do not routinely assign different Social Security numbers. Generally,  only the following circumstances are used to assign a different number :  Sequential numbers have been assigned to members of the same family and are causing problems; More than one person has been assigned, or is using, the same number ;  An individual has religious or cultural objections to certain numbers or  digits in the original number ;  original number; or  domestic violence, has occurred .  A  victim  of  identity  theft  continues  to  be  disadvantaged  by  using  the  Situations  of  harassment,  abuse,  or  life  endangerment,  including   White Lies  P  rivacy  advocates,  no  matter  how  careful,  cannot  get  around  the  SSN requirements on FAFSA forms without risking them saying no. If you use a fake SSN, you can be charged with a felony. So what to do ?  What you do is lie to everyone else . For instance : There  was  a  time  when  I  was  contacted  by  a  collection  agency. TransMediaCorp  or  some  innocuous  name.  Usually  when  a  collection agency calls, if you listen closely you can hear all the other script monkeys banging away on their keyboards in the background, chatting away  mostly lies . My answer was to lie right back to them .  "Is this Mr. X?" agent Betty asked . "Mr. Who?" I shot back.  Always, always get them to repeat it !  She repeated. I feigned deafness. "Say it once more ?" She did and at that point, I corrected her, saying she had the right first name  but  the  wrong  last  name.  It  was  misspelled  and  mispronounced.  I feigned being insulted .  They had the wrong guy. Tough break. She then asked for my SSN. I gave  her  a  false  one  for  the  simple  reason  that  as  soon  as  you  identify yourself  it is after all the FIRST question they will ask , you paint a blood- red  target  on  your  back.  They've  matched  the  name  with  a  legal  address. From there, it will be one perpetual nightmare after another .  The amount in question was a $500 Perkins student loan I had paid off years  earlier,  and  one  that  I'd  taken  on  some  25  years  ago.  But  I  wasn't about to tell her that. God knows if I did, they might consider the debt paid after  I  faxed  proof  of  payment,  but  not  before  they  relayed  my  name  to other collection agencies for their databases .  After  this  episode,  I  called  up  every  service  provider  I  could  think  of that held my SSN and had it changed to the fictitious one. Cable company. Electric. Internet Service Provider. It turned out that even the company that mows  my  lawn  had  it  on  file.  Who  knows  how  they  got  it,  but  only  one company gave me grief over the change: the power company. So I handled it in writing, making sure to use plenty of CAPS and BOLD words filled with sound and fury  signifying nothing, now that I think about it . Some people can better sense a bluff over the phone than by mail .  By mail, you can sound like Tony Soprano and if you don't get some  action you will send the boys over for a polite little talk .   Clone Home  One  option  you  might  employ  is  using  a  mail  service  that  severs  any connection to you. Examples abound of companies you can hire who ask very  few  questions.  A  few  ask  zero questions.  I've  had  good  experiences with  earthclassmail.com  ,  for  instance,  but  there  are  others  if  you  travel internationally .  Another idea is to check out abandoned houses where you live. Mostly this applies to city dwellers but I have found a few in rural settings, too. Use the address of the abandoned house to have any shipments mail sent to you there. Just don't go using the same house over and over again .  It probably is a good time to repeat this: Never give out someone else's information on a credit card or loan application. Like, ever. This includes their address. In most first world countries this is a serious crime. Someone somewhere will get burned as one success will lead to another and it will become a habit that is as hard to get rid of as an alcoholic getting rid of margaritas in Maui. It can also destroy any chance you have if, at a later date, you want to legally get rid of debt via bankruptcy .  Lie, but lie responsibly !   PASSPORTS AND CANADA  T his is an  area  I  regret  having  personal  experience  in.  Since  9 11,  many systems have been built for inter-departmental communications yet airports still  have  lax  security  -  especially  the  TSA.  Border  Stations  are  an interesting study and I dare say Canadian Border Officers are, fortunately, nothing like their lackluster TSA brethren. What gets flagged at one station gets flagged at them all. It's a little too Orwellian for my taste but I try to be respectful whenever I'm passing through .  If  you  drop  attitude  with  the  Canadian  agent  at  the  Niagara  Falls crossing, the guard on the other side of the country can  notice I did not say will   know about it in minutes if he enters it into the system .  The SSN is tied to your name and employment but does not appear on the  passport  itself.  But  a  border  officer  can  ban  you  for  LIFE  if  you  lie about any criminal record entering Canada. They locked out George Bush from entering over a DUI he'd received in 1976. Not kidding. He had to get a waiver and that was just to visit , not actually move there .  Sneaking  in  carries  risks  too,  unless  you  happen  to  be  Nightcrawler from the X-Men and can teleport yourself in the blink of an eye across the Falls. As far as I know, I don't possess this ability .  What can we learn from this ? We can learn not to leave trails . One option is to not use our passport since it leaves a trail just as visible as  the  sulfur  did  for  Nightcrawler.  But  this  is  not  very  practical  since  it makes international travel problematic. Still, sneaking into Canada or into the  USA  does  have  its  advantages  if  you  have  good  reason  to  go  off  the   grid. Many do. In fact, the U.S. border sees more sneak into Canada than the other way. From WinnipegPress :  "More people were caught trying to sneak into Canada at remote border points with the United States in 2008 than the other way around, a newly released intelligence report reveals .  It was the second straight year that continental human smuggling and  other surreptitious crossings tilted in Canada's direction .  The RCMP attributes the trend to factors including a U.S. crackdown on undocumented workers, more American agents along the border and the shaky state of the U.S. economy. The figures, the latest available, show 952 people were caught entering Canada between legitimate border crossings, while 819 were U.S.-bound. They work at strategic points between border crossings  to  thwart  smugglers  of  everything  from  people  and  drugs  to currency and firearms ."  Obviously,  sneaking  across  is  not  a  new  trend.  But  let's  assume  you need  to  sneak  into  Canada  and  need  to  do  it  quietly,  with  no  Orwellian tracking system sniffing at your heels. Let's also assume you are going it solo... with no assistance at all .  Without Assistance  C rossing outside  of  a  checkpoint  is  very  easy.  Nothing  to  it  in  fact.  But doing it anonymously, now that's hard . Harder in big towns. It's illegal to try  and  you  might  not  get  caught  the  first  time.  But  most  guys  will  keep doing  what  they  think  works  the  best  and  then  rinse  and  repeat.  If  they succeeded  on  the  first  try,  well  dag  nabbit  they  are  ingenious!  Rinse  and repeat .  Bank robbers  usually  don't get caught the first time either. It's when they  do  it  again  and  again  using  the  same  method  that  gets  them  caught. Their egos rocket into orbit. They get overconfident. They get cocky. In fact you could apply this trait to most low-level crimes, even non-violent ones like sneaking across .  The  border  itself  looks  like  a  typical  power  line  cut,  forests  on  each side,  but  the  further  you  get  from  a  town,  the  less  guarded  it  is.  But  you should  know  the  ecosystem  of  whatever  area  regardless  if  you  plan  to   hike drive fly through because let's face it, it'd be quite a downer to make all that effort only to be the next contestant on Mr. Grizzly's 'You Bet Your Life '.  Most  rural  spots  and  undeveloped  areas  are  heavily  guarded  by  movement sensors. Trigger one of those and you'll alert the authorities .  Response  time  varies  significantly,  depending  on  population  and distance  to  the  nearest  checkpoint  and  of  course,  manpower.  All  the technology in the world does the Borg no good if all of their Borg drones are overworked and stretched to the limit. This is in your favor .  It may be an hour or ten minutes before one arrives. If the latter, you'll walk a little ways before the border patrol drives up. After which you get to meet Officer Simon Sez who carries a semi-automatic rifle along with four of  his  buddies,  one  of  whom  will  ask  you  point  blank:  "Do  you  realize where you are, sir?" To which you should state with an innocent smile as you look around, feigning relief that you happened upon this nice Canadian officer: "Hale no sir, I don't believe I do. Can you please tell us ?"  Politeness  with  a  dash  of  respect   always  saying  sir   will  win  over  a Canadian border guard 80% of the time, assuming you're not committing a crime, and you are if you're sneaking across !  But that's if you get lucky. If not, you'll be arrested and deported if you don't have dual-citizenship. Not only will Canadian authorities charge and fine  you,  so  will  American  authorities.  It's  a  $5000  US  fine  and  criminal record for circumventing a designated border crossing .  With Assistance   V ery much the easier of the two since it's not exactly rocket science to get you  across  the  border  in  either  a  privately  owned  plane  or  smaller-than- usual boat or other watercraft. Better still if you're smuggled in close to a Mohawk native reservation where cigarette smugglers get picked up all the time  and overlooked  by Canadian border officials .  In the event you do try to cross, make sure it's not the 'easy path' others take.  It's  all  an  illusion  setup  by  the  RCMP  to  catch  you  on  a  well-worn trail.  Most  people  caught  do  something  stupid  like  crossing  at  the  Silver Lake  Road  area  or  farm  land  close  to  the  Huntingdon Sumas  crossing. Every time I hear of a bust, and the details that come from that bust, I think of  what  T-Rex  hunter  Roland  said  in  Jurassic  Park:  Lost  World  when  he tells Hammond's successor to forget about setting base camp at their present location, a location that's plagued with velociraptors .  "Listen, we're on a game trail and carnivores hunt on game trails! Do  you want to setup base camp or a buffet ?"  Smuggling anything like contraband by way of car is foolish. There are sensors at border crossings. Those include vehicle scanning x-ray machines, chemical  sniffers  and  sniffer  dogs.  So  any  attempt  to  hide  in  a  vehicle heading  into  Canada  just  won't  work  either.  The  GlobeandMail  ironically enough went into further detail on what not to do, even revealing that some hotels along the border are under surveillance for illegal crossers .  Bottom line: Don't ever go into velociraptor territory on the cheap !   ANONYMOUS PHONES  How the FBI Traces Calls  N ot every average Joe who loathes the NSA has something illegal to hide, and I'm about as average Joe as you can get. I enjoy shrimp at Red Lobster. I  love  Mardi  Gras  in  the  French  Quarter  whenever  I  visit.  I  play  video games  with  the  kids  down  at  the  Fun  Arcade.  And  sometimes  I  conduct business while they play on prepaid phones called burners while the kids play.  Burners  the  NSA  doesn't  like.  In  fact  they  have  a  real  hard  time linking those phones to my real identity. It isn't impossible, mind you, only difficult.  Since  I  am  not  a  high-value  target,  they  don't  bother.  At  least,  I hope they're not bothering .  Now then, you probably already know about MVNOs  Mobile Virtual Network Operators  that allow you to sign up pseudo-anonymously. They ask  for  no  identifying  info  unless  you  want  to  give  it  to  them  -  but  that alone is not enough to thwart the NSA. Phone companies are now required to  have  the  technology  to  work  with  law  enforcement  under  the  1994 CALEA law .  Worse still is the fact that despite what appeals courts have said, we still have no real expectation of privacy. Most state law dictate that as long as one person knows about the recording, it is legal. Note I did not say one other person. Only one person... the one doing the recording. Wiretap laws are a maze of red tape that would make Stalin blush. The counter is this: not everyone uses the same phone .  That's in our favor .   The Cons of Using a Burner  Y ou can pitch it in the trash after use and dissolve any trail to you. That's it, and  even  then..  as  long  as  you  took  action  to  conceal  your  activity.  The Craigslist  killer  was  caught  by  the  FBI  visa  cell  triangulation--the  GPS signals from his real phone and prepaid phone came from the same place. He even had it on him when he bought the burner phone. When he killed someone, both phones were easily traced since he had them on him when he committed the crime .  Not  so  smart,  but  then  most  criminals  don't  get  caught  the  first  or second time. They get caught on the third , fourth or fifth time  remember bank robbers? . The adrenaline rush addicts them to the point they're always looking for the next fix... often without upgrading their skillset .  The MAC address can kill anonymity as well. Like the IP address for computers tied to a network, it can lead right to your front door. There are apps like Macspoofer that aid in preventing this, but they are not perfect .  The Pros of Using a Burner Phone  N umber one rule: Do not use it continually for any sensitive business or personal transactions. No more than a few days for something important. If you're on vacation in say, Singapore, and don't want the NSA spying on you and the kids, that's easy. Just switch the SIMs out upon arrival. Same for Philippines, Thailand, etc .  But  for  something  like  spying?  That's  a  whole  other  discussion.  One might say, "Well, if I'm running a North Korean spy op, why not bypass any surveillance by having my entire team switch to newly bought phones at the same time ?"  The problem with that is then you've created a clear pattern of a group of phones all activating at the same time. You might even get careless and give each operative the same phones. Further, if the police obtain the IMEI code off of the burner, then all SIM links previously attached to the phone are discovered. Good for them. Not for you .   You could even be outwitted if they visit the places they think you will buy the prepaid burners - obtain the IMEI numbers in advance so as to get a search warrant to eavesdrop on you. Boom. And you have to know that not all team members will dispose of the phones after every communiqué .  Problems, problems. So what to do ? Solution : - Manage two persons responsible for managing all phones -  Buy  phones  from  different  locations,  different  days,  different  purchasers  towers    example  -  Swap  phones  out  at  different  intervals  from  random  locations   cell  - Issue to operatives at different dates - Operatives don't know when phones were activated -  Retire  some  phones  unexpectedly,  some  sooner,  after  risky  ops  for  - Each Op is given set of other Op's numbers, which changes daily   DISAPPEARING FROM SOCIAL MEDIA  L  et's  cut  right  to  the  chase.  Social  Media  did  nothing  for  me  but  make disappearing harder. With every passing year, Facebook wanted more data on  me.  More  of  my  favorite  childhood  cereals   Chocolate  Frosted  Sugar Bombs, I told them - the favorite of Calvin and Hobbes . More of which movies made me cry. Which made me angry. Which made me cringe  the skeleton reveal in Psycho  .  Employers love this about social media. They love that they can google your  name  and  find  all  kinds  of  dirt  on  you  from  Ars  Technica  posts  to Usenet flame wars you've participated in over the years. Once upon a time, Usenet  was  sacred.  You  didn't  talk  about  Usenet.  Now  it's  monitored  by Chinese law enforcement. Yet things I wrote ten years back are visible to anyone.  My  inner  child  mutant  came  storming  out,  fists  clenched,  teeth gritted and spitting insults before the troll meme became fashionable .  While we can't exactly take a Delorean back to 1985 and start nuking old newsgroup posts, what you can do is take a flamethrower to the media giants who aren't doing your career any favors by allowing your ex to post photos of you so drunk in the French Quarter that you performed mouth to mouth on a fainted carriage mule who you could swear winked at you as it went down .  P hase 1: Nuking the Sites From Orbit  I nuked my own Facebook account in May of 2010. Little did I know however that it wasn't truly gone. Instead, it went into a kind of hibernation   state. Surprise, surprise. Facebook, like Google and LinkedIn and Twitter and  YouTube  all  have  this  egregious  habit  of  what  I  call  vampire hoodwinking.  They  lull  you  into  thinking  your  account  is  gone,  when  it really  isn't.  Nothing  is  really  permanently  gone  with  any  of  those behemoths. Not Google, Facebook or even LinkedIn. It'd take the fires of Mt. Doom to do to your account what it did to Frodo's ring .  But let's try anyway .  F acebook  Use this link to delete your account . https:  www.facebook.com help delete_account This  isn't  like  tossing  out  a  batch  of  brownies  when  you're  on  a  new diet. This effect is  supposedly  permanent. You're not going to get it back. You  can't  salvage  anything  for  a  new  account.  So  contact  lists,  favorites, bookmarks,  posts,  pictures  are  all  gone  unless  you  saved  them  locally  to your  hard  drive  or  dropbox.  Now  might  be  a  good  time  to  ask  for  some awkward pics to be taken down .  T witter  Follow this to deactivate your Twitter account . https:  twitter.com settings account Like Facebook, once it's gone, it's GONE. But the process takes time. When I deleted one of my pen names, a horror pen that wasn't selling, it took seven days and a full moon. I never was good at writing omens .  G oogle +  For Google, go to the homepage to deactivate . https:  accounts.google.com Login This will nuke your Gmail and Youtube accounts as well since they tie everything  together,  but  you  can  be  more  selective  in  what  you  wish  to leave. They call it "Downgrading," but know that your identity might still pop up in search engines .   I have personally found AccountKiller to be of high value here, as there were some accounts still active that I hadn't used in years, but a few that had stored my present phone number and address publicly. Enhancements , they claim .  P hase 2: Nuking Criminal and Public Records  Now  we  come  to  the  area  where  Skip  Tracers  love  to  dig,  and  dig DEEP. We're talking Gimli's drunken dwarf king deep who loves to delve in places he shouldn't  how'd that turn out for him ? .  Without any background information, they will be chasing ghosts and wild  geese  to  who  knows  where.  Bad  for  them.  Good  for  us.  We'll  nuke what remnants of our social selves are ripe for the taking -which in the end only hurt us , after all. As we go through these, realize this is a very short list and if there is one thing I love about Reddit, it's that they don't believe in short lists .  Here's the major players . Spokeo - This is the big one. The one every Skip Tracer and collector uses by default. The amount of data they had on me made me want to retch my  In  n'  Out  burger!  Former  email  addresses.  Relationships.  Marriages. Schools.  For  a  few  dollars  more  they'd  probably  tell  a  collector  if  I  put ketchup on my fries or on the side. The kind of guys Agent Smith might call up to find where Neo was hiding .  Intelius -  I  was  in  this  database  too,  but  not  for  any  criminal  activity  whew! .  Like  Spokeo,  they  keep  a  lot  of  data  on  people  without  their consent. Not Agent Smith's first choice, but if Spokeo is down... it is. They trawl  social  media  sites  as  well  as  keep  criminal  data.  Rumor  has  it mugshots are on the way. Are Christmas morning pictures next ?   Zabasearch  -  I  used  this  one  once  to  find  an  old  phone  number  I'd forgotten and didn't want to call up every friend to relay the new one. Later I found that this is the site to use if you're a stalker since, after June 2014, emails containing personal info  not searchable by search engines  became publicly available. Ouch .  Going through every site that I'd given my data to over the last ten years was like trying to defect from a vampire clan. Easier said than done. They want something signed in blood. The worst however was hitting paywalls and upsells . You know, people who claim to save you money and time .  One site did seem to help shorten time taken to erase myself from the internet. That site is DeleteMe . At $129 bucks, it ain't cheap. But if you're strapped for time and don't mind the fee then it can be worth your while .  Staying Off The Radar  F or the next two years you must be consistent with updates. Check those sites every few months for your compliance. Google your name. Your old phone numbers. Old addresses. Old flames. Your identity after all is more valuable  to  you  than  it  is  to  them.  To  them,  you're  simply  a  number  in  a database, and if they had their way, wouldn't mind too terribly the thought of tattooing a number on the back of your neck .  From the moment of Armageddon, I've used Fake Name Generator for many things I do online. You can too. Yes, it does sound like some two-bit app  on  the  Google  Play  Store  that  Babu  wrote  in  Bombay  one  summer's day, but I assure you it isn't. It's quite effective .  If  you  want  free,  DISPOSABLE  mail,  try  Mailinator  .  No  signup  required. No passwords .   MOBILE APPS  M  obile  phones  and  tablets  that  use  WiFi  are  devious  at  hoarding  every private detail of your life. Though it's nearly impossible to completely go off-grid  with  an  online  smart  phone  used  for  business,  let's  look  at  some options .  First up, there's Tor Browser  B et you never knew this was available for Android. This app connects to the anonymous Tor network. Probably overkill for what we wish to do with social media, but helpful for anonymity nuts like me who like the ghost in   the  machine  lifestyle.  It  spoofs  the  IP  address  you  use  and  allows  you  to mask your own hardware .  N ext, there's Spideroak .  I  f  you  like  cloud-storage  *and*  privacy,  check  out  Spideroak.  It  offers "zero-knowledge"  security  and  has  end-to-end  encryption.  The  free  plan gives you 2GB of storage. It's $10 otherwise for 100GB extra and goes up from there .   N ext up is Red Phone . I like this app for it's ease of use whenever I'm in the  USA.  It  secures  every  call  with  end-to-end  encryption,  allowing  you privacy and peace of mind. As well it uses WiFi and offers neat upgrades if both callers have RedPhone installed .  It's  not  perfect,  though,  but  at  least  it's  not  as  expensive  as  say, TrustCall. There are convenience issues like lengthy connection times and dropped calls  ever Skype someone from Manila?  so it's not going to be as quick and easy as Jason Bourne does it in foreign locations .  But  the  pluses  outweigh  the  minuses.  I  especially  love  the  two-word passphrase  as  a  security  feature:  If  you  fear  Agent  Boris  is  dead  and  has been killed by Agent Doris  who now has his phone , you can request she speak the second passphrase. Simple, yet effective .   L  ookout  -  Lookout  Security  gives  you  the  best  protection  against  theft. Phone lost? You can login to the site at lookout.com to locate where a thief has taken your pone. Data backup is also a nice addition .  C ryptoCat - Banned in Iran, Cryptocat is an open-source app that allows encrypted  online  chat.  It  employs  end-to-end  encryption  so  that  you  can   trust your messages are private. Better still is that it can be used with Tor to anonymize your traffic. They also received top scoring in December 2014 on  Electronic  Frontier's  security  score  benchmark  with  some  stiff competition: ChatSecure, TextSecure, Silent Phone and Silent Text. Reason being is that all messages are not only encrypted, but that you can verify the other guy's identity without the company having access to it .  B ullGuard - Bullguard offers anti-theft and backup similar to cryptocat but also  offers  SIM  protections   auto-locks  device  if  SIM  is  removed ,  Call Management  and  Parental  Controls   monitors  your  kids .  Mobile  security also lets you remotely manage your device .   O rbot - A free app that gives you anonymity with an Android device. I use it for my Galaxy Tab 4. Works well with Tor and wasn't hard to configure for my web browser, email client and Maps.Me app .  W  ickr  -  An  instant  messenger  for  iOS  &  Android,  it  offers  end  to  end encrypted  messages  that...  self-destruct.  Includes  file  attachments photos,   too.  PC  Magazine  named  Wickr  an  "Editors'  Choice  for  Android  secure messaging ."  T itanium for PC and  Android  -  Without  a  doubt  my  favorite  app  on  my Android tablet for backups .   STALKERS  F or some reason stalkers tend to be overwhelmingly male when Hollywood spits them out. I can count the number of female stalker flicks on one hand: Fatal Attraction. Misery. The Crush. Those're the ones I've seen. And they make  the  male  ones  look  pale  by  comparison.  Stick  the  knife  into  poor Jimmy and laugh in his face .  Not  exactly  realistic,  though  since  they're  always  a  thousand  times worse on the silver screen than up close. Most stalkers are your next-door neighbor types. But sometimes, well... sometimes there's an exception. An anomaly if you will that slices to bits any preconceived notion of what a stalker looks and acts like. They break the rules .  What  follows  is  my  own  story.  It's  one  memory  I  can't  quite  seem  to delete from my memory banks no matter how hard I try. And lordy, who knows  why.  Perhaps  it's  the  dark  element...  the  unknown.  What  COULD have happened. What she could have done had I not taken it as seriously as I did. Even now my fingers hurt from the constant flexing, cracked-knuckle strain I exert as I contemplate the telling of it all .  But  I'll  leave  out  the  truly  disgusting  parts  in  case  you've  just  eaten  lunch .  The Bayou Grandma Stalker  T he new house I'd rented was as good as any I guessed. Way out there, too, out  near  the  bayou  and  close  to  La  Place  and  juuust  outside  Kenner,   Louisiana but far enough from the traffic and airport that it squashed any worries about jet engines overhead. But the mosquitoes, sweet Jesus were they big. Winged vampires with probos so damn big you'd swear you'd been shot in the buttocks with a poison dart like one of them pigmy tribes make . My father had rented the place to parolees - mostly thieves from what I'd  heard.  Big  time,  small  time,  bank  robbers,  shoplifters,  pimps.  Didn't matter what kind. It'd been far enough out of town so as to limit temptation, he'd said, but a couple months passed with no takers. Enter yours truly on a 3-month dry spell in book sales and just generally unemployable for eons . I still remember his words as he handed me the keys: "Don't turn the place  into  a  dirty  whorehouse.  Sheriff  don't  like  that."  "Whore?  What're those?" I asked. He smiled back. That toothless grin of his never put me at ease like it did when I was five, but now I knew how much of a hard ass he was .  I only paid a quarter rent in exchange for repairing the place, but lordy how  I  loathed  crawling  under  the  house  to  fix  anything  .  It  wasn't  the tarantulas I feared. It was that dadgum Daddy-long-leg spiders that spooked me the most. Mobs! I'd bang out 1000 new words daily  my self-imposed quota at the time  and they'd bang out 10000 baby spiders as I typed the last word. On some dark nights I could swear I heard em popping out under the floorboards like popcorn in a microwave .  Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop . Then  things  got  louder  in  July.  Peeper  frogs  amid  every  god-forsaken bog noise in the universe kept me up. You'd think I'd have gotten use to em, but no. Afternoons were only slightly better. I made a promise to keep busy. I'd survey the property, check mail, repair pipes, try not to sweat too much as it killed my writing mood, when one day I noticed something off .  Some of my mail looked opened. In fact it looked read . That feeling, you know? Smudges. Strange scents. Like the kind church ladies wear on Sunday.  Letters  were  out  of  order,  too.  Bills  were  upside  down  like someone'd repacked them after sticking a cherry bomb into the mailbox .  Humidity. Maybe . I walked down the lonely road to meet the neighbor I'd put off meeting. A  neighbor  who  lived  in  a  house  that  leaned  toward  the  airport,  like  the wood  wanted  to  fly  off  and  forever  be  rid  of  this  frog-infested  shithole. Spooky branches prevented this, of course. "You're staying here," the wood seemed to say .   Anyway  I  knocked  and  knocked.  No  answer.  Went  around  back, knocked  some  more,  ridged  my  forehead  and  looked  around  as  I  wiped away  sweat  and  scratched.  The  bog  seemed  far  quieter  here  despite  La Place more than living up to its reputation as the Saharan desert of marshes .  I left a note, an invitation for the neighbor to come by and share a beer with me, the new guy  or an iced tea and a Bigfoot flick if a lady . A guy could hope, right ?  After heading home I banged out 1500 more words and popped in The Thing as I kicked back a couple of Buds. "Where's Blair?" a voice said into the gloom. Ah, I'd forgotten the electricity had cut out midway the previous Saturday.  I  ignored  the  creaky  boards  under  my  feet  and  sank  into  the couch. Dusty as hell, it was like sinking into a puffy mushroom. The kind some British kids like to play soccer with .  Just when the movie got to the gross "Let's see who's The Thing" blood- test-by-self-inflicted-razor, I heard a noise. I sat up just as, once again, the electricity shut off .  Shit . Then  came  a  catty  sound.  Mauling.  A  yawning  slow  kind  of  sound.  What the hell ?  ...scratch....scratch....scraaaaatch . The door, I thought. I crept to the door over-thinking it as usual. A cat? Not a chance - too slow to be a cat. This was more like a taunt . A set of nails being dragged across a chalkboard to grate someone's nerves kind of taunt. My nerves .  I  looked  out  the  window.  Darkness  looked  back  at  me  and  I  started flexing my fingers and cracking my knuckle one-handedly. Think rational. Think logically. But the darkness was so thick it seemed stitched into the clothing  of  whomever  had  disturbed  me.  Intense  camouflage.  Whoever  it was standing out there. I could swear I saw something . Something frozen so stuff and absolute it was as though dark matter had enveloped it. Despite this, I hated the thought of showing fear by running to get my revolver in the  bedroom.  No,  I  thought,  and  frowned  chewing  on  my  bottom  lip.  I'd face this punky prankster head on .  I swung the screen door open so hard it flew off the hinges . The monolithic figure was gone. Not a soul stood there, nothing at all but  boggy  air.  I  stepped  out  and  as  I  did  waved  the  fog  away.  Nothing,   absolutely nothing, made a sound. Not even peeper frogs .  A few days later I walked next door once more, determined as ever to find out if my neighbor knew of any rascally kids making mischief in these mossy parts. God knew they had nothing better to do .  This time I met her: a sweet old lady that could never harm a fly. She invited  me  in.  She  even  made  tea  and  biscuits.  A  British  lady  with  a midnight  cat  straight  out  of  Sleepy  Hollow.  Herself?  Liverpool  from  the sound of it. Who knew but what I did know was that she had a class and a grace  I  couldn't  quite  match  due  to  my  swampbilly  upbringing.  I  let  her prattle on and simply nodded and hmm'ed and smiled rather than allow my lips to leak my ignorance .  French-Acadian lineages was the topic, her spessscialty apparently. Not my cup of tea but I listened anyway as she did most of the talking and I just sat  there  like  a  bump  on  a  log  soaking  it  all  in.  And  that  she  did  with  a vengeance! Talked my ear clean off as frogs croaked outside .  Ten  minutes  into  it,  my  mind  wandered  and  I  noticed  a  faint  lisp.  I stared at her wrinkled lips as they quivered and bounced from topic to topic and saw an oddity. No, not her lips. Her tongue . Her tongue looked cut. A small one to be sure, right at the tip that affected her speech. Was I seeing things? The day was hot and hazy .  A paper cut? I wondered . The only time I'd ever done that myself was when I licked an envelope a  little too fast .  Lightning struck . She'd half-assed the licking of my envelopes somehow. When this light bulb bloomed in my head, I noticed her eyes widen and her speech crawl. I coulda sworn I heard her heart speed up as a dark narrative began to unroll in my thoughts. She knew I knew. She had to! It was written right there in her liquid-green eyes .  I excused myself to the restroom and on the way back cut through the kitchen and out of the corner of my eye saw a familiar name next to a Home Sweet Home frame with a few scattered nails. It was an open envelope with my name on it .  I grit my teeth so hard my loose tooth almost popped out. That crinkly  old thief !  I  paused  to  rub  my  chin,  my  neck,  both  my  eyes.  Maybe  I  was  just imagining  things,  I  told  myself.  Working  too  hard.  Worrying  too  much.   Swamp fever possibly... or perhaps the mailman simply slipped one into the wrong box. I'd done that myself a few times working campus mail back in the day .  But I just couldn't stomach the thought of that old bat, smart as she was, scraping through my mail. Scraping my things. Stabbing my privacy in the back. Stalking me. And for what reason? So I called her on it in as polite a way as I could fathom yet fully expecting a sincere apology, to which I'd apologize right back .  I was wrong . Her face changed right before my eyes. I thought I was hallucinating at first. That maybe the old witch had poisoned my tea with some dart frog resin. Those sweet, elderly church fingers clenched as she stared at the floor coldly, the paleness of her jaw becoming steely, a kind of veil of jaundice sliding over her face. She seemed to be turning to stone! It was a look I had never seen even in a hardened criminal. A faraway, ancient look, like she'd just celebrated her 2000th birthday and here I was spoiling her party by not outstretching my own wrists. And when she fixed her cataract eyes on me, I nearly bolted for the door right then and there. She noticed this and said ,  "Well now, dearie. It seems that you've c --" Before she could finish, I tipped my old Port Authority cap and exited  before she could finish. That was it. I was outta there, permanently .  Later when I asked my father to look into her past, it turned out she was anything  but  the  nice,  country  granny  I'd  believed.  She'd  done  time  for murder, theft and chronic shoplifting. Oh, and slapping a judge as he sat in Preservation  Hall  just  inside  the  French  Quarter.  Just  walked  right  up  to him.  Brilliant.  This  on  top  of  the  sweet,  sugar-coated  lies  she  told  me, smiling like a Cheshire cat right into my face .  I  was  forced  to  move  three  days  later  due  to  further  circus-monkey  antics .  sealed with liquid gold .  The old crone stole my mail as though each and every one of them were  But there was more. She broke into my house while I vacationed way up  in  Thunder  Bay,  Ontario.  I'd  set  up  a  hidden  cam  to  silence  my naysaying  father  hoping  to  catch  her  in  the  act  and  send  her  to  the  Big House once again with all the other harpies. Only I failed .  She'd spent hours simply rocking back and forth in my living room with her  black  cat   who  kindly  relieved  himself  behind  my  couch .  My  father   laughed.  Pointed,  and  laughed.  But  I  was  determined.  I  did  some  more digging .  It turned out she had a son that died a year prior running from police after a robbery. A son with a history of crime with a face *remarkably* like mine. I could sense some residue of reason behind her madness .  Only now I cannot watch John Carpenter's The Thing without smelling  that darn cat .  S o what did I learn from this? What can you learn ?  I learned that stalkers come in all sizes and flavors of the rainbow and in all  likelihood,  will  not  be  a  stranger  to  you.  You  will  know  this  person personally. They may even be in a relationship with you. Celebrities have the  cash  to  deal  with  them:  Catherine  Zeta-Hones  and  Dave  Letterman come  to  mind.  Guys  like  you  and  me  must  use  our  wits  since  we're  not winning the lottery anytime soon .  The Hitchhiker  In the 1990s I picked up a hitchhiker on my way from New Orleans to a local Mississippi college to inquire about teaching for a semester. It was a long  ride.  My  radio  was  broken.  I  could  use  some  nice  conversation,  I thought. Besides that, he looked like a clean-cut, Leave-It-To-Beaver type. You've  seen  them:  Sharp  dresser.  Smooth  talker.  Great  big  smile  with  a perfect  row  of  teeth.  The  perfect  guy  to  sell  a  Porsche  to  someone  with eight  of  them  already.  The  kind  of  guy  you'd  trust  with  your  daughter  in your weekend cabin for the weekend but who'd later break her heart in half, lickety-split. When he got into the car, he smelled like Georgio cologne and cigarettes .  Well  we  got  to  talking  about  everything  under  the  sun.  Politics.  The weather. The cool new age music on the Weather Channel that he wanted to badly to identify  Pat Metheny, I said . We even talked about Mississippi girls compared to Canadian girls - a world of difference, actually. I asked him what he was studying. His reply ?   "I want to be a sorcerer just like my daddy ." I nearly hit a fire hydrant just as a dog was doing his business. By god, I  had a male wiccan in my car dressed like Bill Gates .  Before  I  could  laugh  at  this  obvious  joke  he  was  playing  on  me,  he proceeded to lay out his whole philosophy of life, real slow and methodical like,  waving  his  fingers  around  like  a  magician.  I  began  to  ask  him questions about this so-called "career." As it turned out, I had to give him personal info about me for every question I asked. Sort of like bartering for dummies. A power thing to him. Personal validation was everything, as was his image . I went along with it just as my hands became sweat-filled on the steering wheel and by the time I dropped him off at his destination, I said a little prayer of thanks to the Almighty that the guy never pulled a gun on me .  Would he have? I dunno, maybe. Maybe not . Bottom line? Appearances are deceptive. That includes: Scents. Visuals. Touch. Audio. Strangers can get into your head and stay there unless you say one word at the outset :  "NO ." Say no to clinginess and control-freaks who'd rather you hang out with  them then visit your dying mother in the retirement home .  Now, I was beyond polite with him. A lot of guys I know in Mississippi wouldn't. They'd boot his butt right out as soon as he prattled on about his plans to conquer the world with "Dark Energy." But if you do THAT, you're gonna  risk  trouble.  Be  firm,  but  polite.  Don't  say,  "Get  the  hell  outta  my truck, Bozo, before I pump yer gut fulla lead !"  Say,  "That's  interesting,"  which  I  did,  to  which  his  reply  was:  "So  do  you accept my philosophy, brother ?"   he called me brother the entire trip and it always coincided with him  touching my knee    I feigned ignorance, explaining I needed him to tell me more... more... more... all the way to the college. It worked. But he did demand my phone number and address at the end. Fake, of course .  Violence  ensues  if  you  take  the  wrong  road,  and  that  certainly  might have happened if I'd brought his whole self-image crumbling to the ground. Leave the "tough-love" talk for someone else. A judge, maybe .   DISAPPEARING DIFFICULTIES  Y  ou  might  be  wondering  what  it  truly  takes  to  do  a  Houdini-style disappearing act. The answer is this: it depends on how invisible you want to  be.  There  are  different  levels  to  it  that  require  different  mindsets  and experience.  You  might  be  invisible  one  day  but  goof  the  next,  and  now people can see a sliver of an outline as you walk down the street. They may come  closer  to  investigate  since  invisibility  is  a  power  few  people  wield effectively. Power draws attention. Most people want that attention, if they aren't running like you are .  Another  thing  it  takes,  is  balls.  Fortitude  and  courage  too,  but  mostly balls because you're not only evading a stalker but his family too since he can call any one of them at any time to aid in the pursuit. That's what law enforcement does with prison escapees - they call for help  unless they're New Yorkers in which case they like to solve the case all by themselves and take all the credit - kinda like Patton  .  "The quicker we clean up this goddamned mess, the quicker we can take a little jaunt against the purple pissing Japs and clean out their nest, too... before the goddamned Marines get all of the credit !"  Anyway,  stalkers  take  all  kinds  of  forms.  Even  Stalin  was  a  stalker, lurking  in  the  shadows  and  waiting  to  pounce  and  rip  out  the  heart  of anyone rebuking him for slitting throats on the way to the top .  So let's say you are on the run from someone who wants to take your life. Someone far less powerful than Stalin was. Someone you thought was Mr. or Ms. Romantic, before they turned to the Dark Side. The short of it is that you must have a battle plan IN PLACE long before you run. Turning invisible is the easy part. Staying invisible is the hard part .   Actually now that I think about it, let's up the threat a little bit. Forget romance stalkers. Let's say you're on the run from the authorities. If you can master that, you can master anything else since it becomes a hundred times harder if you now have not one, but dozens of stalkers who are trained to find people on the run. They don't master pathfinding and detective work in any federal training program, by the way, not even in the ATF which has one of the longest programs for agents. They master it by doing it for years and years and learning from not only their own mistakes, but their comrades in  other  State  departments  and  Federal  agencies  with  which  they  share strategies of capturing prey .  It's  not  all  gloomy,  however.  Knowing  what  the  authorities  greatest strengths and weaknesses are can help immensely since many get cocky and overconfident after years of success. Can they monitor every train station? Bus depots? Can they shut them down with a court order on the fly? A few can post-9 11. How about gas stations - how many have cameras? Which ones  don't?  Underground  tunnels  -  can  they  seal  you  tight  by  closing  off both ends? You must know all of this before running .  And forget about using even a small airport to jet away .  ID  T  he  other  pain  the  neck  is  your  identity.  There's  a  world  of  difference between showing a fake ID to a bank to open an account and one that will get  you  past  airport  security.  So  you'll  need  a  fake  passport  which  is expensive  more than a grand in most cities, and you have to know whom to contact  .  Do you plan on hoofing it by foot or hitchhiking? This brings a whole new  level  of  risk  since  you'll  stick  out  even  more  than  you're  already sticking out. A stick in the mud with one of those twirly caps .  Think about it. How many hitchhikers did you see last week? If you live near  Yosemite  or  the  Appalachian  trailer,  I'll  grant  maybe  thirty  or  so. Anywhere else, not so many. Better to rent a car, but you should be picky about  it  and  find  a  rental  outlet  that  accepts  cash  deposits.  Know  that whatever identification you use will be used to run a credit check. More risk .   Go someplace where American tourists expats are few and far between. You need not go to Yemen, but consider South America which is filled with nice little getaways to let the heat simmer down. Mexico is a bit too close for comfort  though Yucatan is a nice spot . Many go to Venezuela, but you don't want to stay there forever. Can your parents visit you? Should they, if the evil wizard Foozle is watching them like hawks ?  You run out of money quickly being on the run. So you needs lots of it. Enough to bankroll your hotels as well as gasoline for travel and, let's face it, you don't want to eat Thai food 24 7 365 days a year. I'd say save at least five years worth as this will buy more than you can imagine. This brings up our next topic: Friends .  Sanctuary  Funds  Friends  T here's a saying in Hong Kong about money :  "When money is stolen you can only beat the dog ." Put  another  way,  if  you  have  money  -  you  have  friends  .  It's  rather Nietzschian  to  my  aged  eyes  but  it  is  what  it  is.  Sad  fact  of  life,  isn't  it? About as anti-virtue as you can get. Money indeed does buy friends. And those same friends can help you out in a jam and believe me that jam will come sooner or later. The difference could be whether you sleep in a house or sleep in a cell with mice running over your ankles at night next to Soapy the Bum .  There is a lot to be said about humility and shunning the love of money, but when all is said and done the Almighty might not help you out in this regard  if  you  don't  prepare  for  winter.  So  get  it  then,  don't  procrastinate. Save! Again, you need five years worth if for no other reason than to sleep at night with peace of mind. Worries that stack tend to cloud judgment and contribute  to  mistakes  we  wouldn't  otherwise  have  had  made  if  we  had green in the bank. You'll also need it to buy intel, but careful about buying   intelligence on your enemies since merely looking can  tip  them  off  if  the guy you hired is sloppy .   SECURING YOUR COMPUTER  W hen I relayed to  my  grandmother  last  Christmas  that  I  write  books  on anonymity  and  how  to  become  invisible,  she  nearly  gagged  on  her macadamia nut cookie. I got dead air. I thought maybe I'd given her a heart attack. Then came the lecture. I was going to get arrested by the FBI and every  other  alphabet  agency.  I'd  be  waterboarded.  Chipped.  Brainwashed. I'd be the next Edward Snowden  though I'm not nearly as handsome  .  People, old people especially, tend to group the word anonymity under a pretty  big  umbrella  that  includes  hackers,  spies  and  contract  killers.  If you've  got  an  encrypted  hard  drive,  then  you've  got  something  to  hide, perhaps the location to where you buried Jimmy Hoffa .  "Encryption?"  she  asked,  "I  hope  you're  not  hanging  around  one  of  those Goodfella guys. Besides, isn't that illegal, dearie? Hm ?"  "Not on your life, and thank heavens for small miracles. But I can tell you this: " I reassured, "Even if it were, I'd still teach people how to secure their data somehow. Keep it away from snoops ."  "But we're all snoops, dear ." "True, but some are more snoopy than others ." "But dearest, I don't want you getting into trouble with the government. They're are friend y'know and they know best  a silent groan from me at this point  ."  As we've mentioned before, the last thing you want is for a stalker to grab  your  laptop  while  you're  in  the  restroom  in  a  public  place.  This happened  to  me  on  a  cold,  foggy  morning  at  Wendy's  close  to  the  New Orleans French Quarter. Patrons were few and pigeons were still perched on the wires as early as it was. Seemed safe enough. No harm in just leaving   my laptop running since all I'd intended was to get in and out of the john, right? My bookbag as well was right beside it. You know what happened next .  Next thing I saw when I walked out of the restroom was a ten year old black kid in grey sweatpants gunning it for the streetcar that went round to the projects; the worst place to chase a thief with a car .  But  I  was  determined  to  get  back,  1.   my  laptop  and  2.   my  bookbag that contained the new shrinkwrapped Elder Scrolls game I'd bought from Babbages. Later I recalled being more concerned with the game, such were my hobbled priorities .  So I used my feet and dashed like the wind, chasing him down Canal St. all the way to St. Charles Ave. When I finally caught up with him, the kid swung and slipped from my grasp like one of those kids in the Philippines who can shimmy up a palm tree in 3 seconds flat to avoid a big cat's teeth. Thankfully I was the faster one, at least horizontally. He ended up dropping it. My laptop shattered as it hit the concrete. My grip tightened like a vice around his arm. He snapped at me like I was in the wrong .  "Get the hell offa me 'fore I bust yer face !" He got off lucky, as did I. As he ran down the street flipping me off, I realized that if he'd been a stalker, an ex-flame, and if my laptop had been unencrypted I'd have been toast. He'd have access to :  - My credit cards - Login passwords for every tech forum under the sun - Emails - Amazon, eBay, Google+, Facebook, etc . The same can happen to you. Worse case scenario: he steals your laptop then leaves it on your doorstep the next morning with an anonymous sticky note. Something about "feeling guilty." Which is a load of bull since your Alienware  laptop  is  now  accursed  with  a  keylogger.  The  kid  wants  bank account access. Greedy access .  And that's just identity theft. There are other risks, like getting caught trying  to  preserve  invisibility.  Some  people  just  like  to  stay  out  of  the spotlight  for  whatever  reason.  By  encrypting  your  laptop  you  not  only defeat identity thieves, you defeat anyone and everyone that has an interest in seeing you burn .   Tor  I hate to insert a bit of overlap here as some of my other books delve quite deep into Tor territory, but you just can't write a book on invisibility without at least mentioning it. So here goes .  Tor  hides  the  IP  address  that  websites  identify  you  with.  No  matter where you go on the internet, if you're not using Tor, you're being tracked somehow  by  someone,  somewhere.  Usually  the  big  name  companies  like Coke  and  Dell  and  Google.  The  good  news  is  that  it's  free.  As  in,  really free. No upselling at all as it's not a commercial product. It is the app for anonymity  enthusiasts  and  beginners  alike.  So  much  so  that  the  NSA targeted it specifically along with Truecrypt because they were so powerful. So  powerful,  in  fact,  that  when  used  together  they  grant  you  complete invisibility online .  The  NSA  failed  to  defeat  it.  Though  that  did  not  stop  the  FBI  from taking a stab at it. They hacked a few websites on the Deep Web by way of browser  exploits   or  NIT  -  Network  Investigative  Technique   that manipulated Javascript to reveal IP addresses. Addresses that lead to your front  door.  These  exploits  that  have  been  fixed  and  it's  important  to  note that  you  don't  need  Javascript  for  the  internet  to  work.  Some  websites, however, won't work  porn ! .  Still, after downloading it from the Tor homepage, you need to ensure via the NoScript addon that Javascript is turned off. This will break some websites that use it heavily like CNN and sites with tons of flash videos. But  then  if  a  site  is  running  a  dozen  scripts  it  is  likely  those  scripts  are tracking you in some way to as to better target you with ads .  Benefits of Tor  1 . Immune to Ad Tracking . What you'll see is ads targeted to some guy in Germany or Japan, since the IP will be that of a Tor user's exit relay  Tor users can volunteer as exit nodes if they wish, but it's not mandatory to use Tor  .   2 . You can surf the Deep Web, aka .onion sites that are not reachable via the  regular  internet.  The  downside  is  little  to  no  moderation.  If  you remember  how  'Wild  West'  Usenet  was  back  in  the  1990s,  you'll  have  a good  idea  of  what  it's  like.  Freenet  is  also  like  that,  though  it  does  not connect  to  the  Deep  Web  in  the  same  way  Tor  does.  In  fact,  it's  a  whole different Wild West show, which we will go over shortly .  3  .  Communicate  Anonymously  .  Using  Tor,  you  can  say  whatever  you want in a forum and not have it traced back to the real You. But don't expect all moderators to not take action to ban your account if you step over the line. Yes, I realize I just contradicted myself here. Perhaps it's better to state that there is little moderation rather than no moderation on the Deep Web. But what there is, is moderated by lords of the sith in one flavor or another .  4 . Upload to file-sharing sites Anonymously . Sites like those owned by the former  Megaupload  founder.  If  you  need  to  get  something  to  someone without leaving a trace  even if the zip file is encrypted , such is possible with Tor as long as the website does not block it .  Tails  T ails allows you to use Tor and avoid tracking and censorship and in just about any location you could want. It houses its own operating system and is designed for those who don't wish to use their main rig to connect to Tor  though you still can, however if you wish  .  You've  got  several  choices  at  your  disposal:  You  can  run  it  via  USB stick,  SD  or  even  a  DVD.  This  is  pretty  handy  as  strengthens  your resistance to viruses. It's also beneficial if you don't want your hard drive to leave remnants of your browsing session. The best part is that it's free and based  on  Linux  and  comes  with  chat  client,  email,  office,  and  browser. Everything the anonymity enthusiast needs to wear Frodo's cloak online .  The downside to using a DVD though, is that you must burn it again each time you update Tails. Not very convenient. So let's install it to USB   stick instead .  1.  Download tails installer . https:  tails.boum.org download index.en.html You must first install it somewhere, like a DVD , and THEN clone it the  USB stick or SD card .  2 .  Click Applications --> Tails --> Tails install to begin the installation .  3 .  Choose Clone & Install to install to SD card or USB Memory Stick  4 .  Plug in your device, then scan for the device in the Target-Device drop down  menu.  You'll  get  a  warning  about  it  overwriting  anything  on  the device, blah-blah. Choose yes to confirm the installation .  Tails by itself is quite a powerful tool to use to cloak yourself online. But  when  combined  with  an  air-tight  and  secure  operating  system  like Linux,  it  is  virtually  unstoppable  .  If  you  have  the  luxury  of  choosing vanilla  Tor  browser  in  Windows  or  using  Tails,  always  go  with  Tails. Windows has always been the favorite whipping boy of the FBI as well as hackers in general since the number of security holes far outnumber those in Linux .  But  Linux  doesn't  have  nearly  the  amount  of  supported  games.  Few supported  games  =  fewer  families  using  it  =  fewer  hackers  interested  in exploiting it for personal or financial reasons. Them's the breaks .  VPNs  V  PN  stands  for  Virtual  Private  Network.  Great  for  privacy,  lousy  for anonymity  unless  you  use  it  in  addition  to  Tor.  If  you  want  rock-solid privacy and anonymity  they're not the same thing , then double-wrap .  When I signed up for my first VPN, I was surprised how easy it was. Almost  as  easy  as  signing  up  with  my  Usenet  provider,  Astraweb.  Only   instead  of  paying  $10 month  for  newsgroups,  you  pay  $10  for  a  private connection that masks your IP address. You install the app from the service like  CloudVPN  and  connect  through  that.  The  VPN  can  be  from  any country  but  if  you  want  subpoena-resistant  VPN  service  that  approaches anonymity, you better pick a VPN that resides in a country that isn't known for cooperating with U.S. authorities. No, not Iran. Think France, China or Venezuela. It's not 100% subpoena-proof, but luck favors the prepared .  Freenet  T he Big Brother of Tor, Freenet doesn't really hide your IP address. It hides what you're downloading with your IP address . Say you want to download a blu-ray movie  not many of those on Freenet, but let's say for argument that  you  had  one  you  wanted  to  share .  You'd  install  Freenet  .  Then  the Frost frontend addon  discussed below . Then you'd click the upload button which  would  give  you  the  Chk  address  you  need  to  share  it  with  others. Then you'd paste said Chk address to one of the hundreds of Freenet groups available .  Benefits of Using Freenet  C  hat  anonymously  .  Freenet  is  known  for  it's  "Darknet"  functions  that allow complete anonymous communication between two people or even a group.  Upon  installtion,  you  choose  the  security  level.  Low  security,  in which it is easy for others  with sufficient resources  to find your identity, or high security, in which you only connect to darknet peers - friends you absolutely  trust.  Your  files  are  still  encrypted  end  to  end  so  that  no  one knows who uploaded or downloaded what .  D ownload Anonymously . As stated, anything you downloaded, provided you  chose  normal  security  levels  at  installation,  will  not  be  viewable  by anyone else because of the end-to-end encryption .   Downsides to Using Freenet  1 .  Freenet is SLOW . It is not nearly as fast as Bittorrent or eMule. It takes hours to days to download files a gigabyte in size or higher. Plus, if you've an  older  PC,  it  is  a  bit  on  the  resource-intensive  side  of  things,  though anything with an i3 cpu and up will be much faster. That's faster resource- wise. Not download speed .  2 .  Freenet is complicated . It's not that hard to install and use. It's just hard to  find  darknet  peers  you  can  trust  if  you  want  Full  Anonymity.  The "average" security level is fine for most people, but if you're the leader of a resistance movement in Iran, by all means go perfect dark. Just be certain your darknet peers are 100% trustworthy - a hard feat in this day and age when you've never actually met any of those peers !  3  .   Freenet  is  buggy  .  It's  insanely  good  at  giving  you  anonymity.  Even better  than  Tor,  many  say,  but  you  need  Java  installed  for  it  to  work. Because  of  the  sheer  complexity  of  it  all,  it's  not  perfect.  Yes,  Freenet checks whether you have Java on install but even then it occasionally spits out  an  error  if  you  try  to  connect.  It's  usually  wrapper-related  if  on Windows. If this happens, keep trying! Even now, in 2015, I get errors on occasion.  I  just  ignore  them  and  keep  hitting  'Connect'  until  it  'locks  on'. Three times is usually enough .  O h and by the way, never give your Freenet ID to anyone on Freenet. It breaks your anonymity .  Frost   F reenet on its own is unbearably complex to my old eyes. So I was elated when Frost came around. It's a good front end to make reading groups  and downloading CHK files  easier .  Rest assured, there are far more groups then what you see in the above image. This is just the ones available after install - a few I cherry pick just to get things going. You'll have to click the "globe" icon at the top to get a full  list,  and  it  will  take  some  time,  anywhere  from  an  hour  to  a  day  to reveal every single group available .  But first, let's download and install it. It's available at : http:  jtcfrost.sourceforge.net   Extract the contents into wherever you want to run the application from. If an encrypted container, then you need to have that encrypted container mounted first, then unzip it there .  e.g. Z:\Freenet\Frost Next create a shortcut to the 'frost.bat' file within. I like to then drag the shortcut to my accessories menu in Windows. Then I disable the annoying splash screen within the Frost options screen .  After that Frost will ask you for an identity nic, something you can use to post messages. This has nothing to do with your IP address, so fear not. It's just a nickname like you'd use for a Usenet posting in a discussion group .  O ptions  What I do is go into the News2 section in the options page and check to see if "Hide Messages with Trust States" has "Bad" checked. Then I look at the  other  option:  "Don't  add  boards  to  known  boards  list  from  users  with trust states"... I check off Check, Bad, Observe and None  unsigned  so that I don't end up with boards I don't want in the known boards list. Easy, peasy .  Now then. Look in the News1 section and set the "number of days to display." If you want to see what you missed for the last few months, adjust this  number  accordingly,  to  say  300  or  however  far  back  you  want  to download. This is wholly different than Usenet, where a group will go as far back as five years automatically .   T rust  You can control what Frost displays and what it does not. Believe me, this is a godsend when you want to ignore or vet certain users. This is done by way of the trust settings coded into Frost itself .  The options are: Trust, Observe, Check, or Bad. If you mark a user to "Trust," then that person can send you encrypted messages and vice-versa in addition to providing missing blocks of data you might happen to need that this person has. The Observe and Check options are simple: Observe means  that  I  will  observe  that  person's  behavior  until  I  can  make  up  my mind  on  whether  to  trust  him  or  not.  Check  is  the  normal  state  of  trust, meaning no decision's been made on their trust state .  Setting a user's trust to BAD will nuke any posts that person makes on any Frost board. That doesn't mean it's nuked from Freenet, as there is no censorship. It's still there, just invisible to my own eyes. I simply won't see his racist rants  of which there are many on Freenet  .  Now then. It could be that we've had conversations on Freenet that we don't want the wife to know about, or the police. I spoke with an attorney on here  once  and  I  remember  thinking  that  if  ever  the  police  were  privy  to what went on in that conversation, the jig was up. And over a lousy ticket! They'd know my defense before I could even mount it .  Well.  Speaking  of  mounting,  that's  something  we  need  to  implement: We  need  to  encrypt  our  operating  system,  or  at  least  at  a  minimum,  our conversation and preferably our Freenet and Frost installation. We do this by way of encrypted containers. If we're trying to disappear and we need to cross the border for example, what we don't want happening is Mr. Groucho the  Canadian  Border  Guard  getting  angry  about  wanting  to  see  what  we were talking about in that darknet room. Loose lips and all .  I've been back and forth across the Canadian border more times than I can count and if there is one thing I've learned, it's that the personality of border  guards  are  notoriously  inconsistent  across  the  board.  On  Monday you'll  get  someone  with  the  personality  of  SuperGrover.  That  smiley  guy could be asked to wear a red cape and he'd salute his supervisors and thank them for the great idea. Then on Tuesday you'll get the border guard no one likes to get: a cross between Animal and those two grumpy old farts in the nosebleed seats of the Muppet Show. He's the kid who was scarred for life when his mint ice cream cone fell over at Disneyland. And now he takes that trauma out on you !   So  with  that  horrid  image  out  of  the  way,  let's  discuss  encrypted  containers .  Counter-Forensics  E  ncrypted  containers  are  easy  to  store  files  in.  What  isn't  so  easy  is learning the application that enables it. But fear not. Truecrypt took me but a  mere  weekend  to  figure  out  and  when  I  did,  I  kicked  myself  for  not installing  it  sooner.  My  earliest  thought  was  that  one  needed  to  be  an advanced coder of some sort to use it. Maybe one of those so-called NSA superhackers we hear so much about. I was so wrong .  If you can install Windows, you can install Truecrypt. Or Veracrypt or Drivecrypt or Diskcryptor or any variation thereof. They all encrypt your files but have different ways of doing it, and many, many apps are available as  you  will  see.  But  let's  go  with  the  free  ones  first:  Truecrypt  and Veracrypt, two excellent choices for us that give a lot of bang for less than a buck .  Truecrypt is first up since the GUI of Veracrypt is practically the same  as it's digital brother .  Truecrypt ?"  "Hold on a second," you say. "Isn't the NSA involved in undermining  Yes and no. It's true from NSA slides leaked that we can see Truecrypt and Tor were in their crosshairs for a long time, but then so is everything else that's tough to crack .  Here's what Veracrypt developers had to say about it. You can interpret  it however you wish .  "I  am  sure  the  people  involved  in  TrueCrypt  couldn't  have  stayed anonymous and the security agencies knew who they were," he said. "But when  you  look  at  the  code,  you  get  the  idea  that  these  people  must  have been in their 40s back in 1995. So now they are in their 60s, and they are probably tired or retired ."  T ruecrypt   There's something else about Truecrypt you might not have heard. It's been  discontinued  as  of  2015,  but  all  the  major  encryption  apps  work similarly and it is still secure according to many reliable sources. Once you learn  how  to  use  Truecrypt,  Veracrypt  is  a  peace  of  cake.  Or  you  can  go ahead and start with Veracrypt. Your choice .  If  you  choose  Truecrypt,  you  need  to  know  the  basics  of  creating container  files.  Once  you  do  that,  encrypting  the  OS  is  simpler.  So  let's create a container file .  Download the app and install. Create a container file. Think of it as a treasure chest for which you will create a magic password to open it. Being magic, you wouldn't share that password, right? Right. So never share that password .  Here's the quick rundown : 1.  After  installation,  ensure  you  have  enough  free  space  for  your container. How big is the data you're putting inside? Blu-Ray size? Set it accordingly .  2. Select "Create new Volume" from the drop-down menu . 3.  Now  you've  two  choices:  go  the  standard  route  or  the  double- encrypted  treasure  chest  route   Hidden  volume ,  also  called  plausible deniability  .  For  a  beginner,  let's  go  with  a  simple  file  container  since hidden  volumes  require  two  passwords  and  can  get  a  little  tricky  if  you want to store files larger than 4 gigs therein .  4. You'll soon get to a screen where you have to 'Select File'. Click it. Browse to where you want to store this encrypted container soon to be full of treasure. Don't click on any files yet. Just type in a name in the filename box and choose Save-- We'll add our treasure later .  5. Choose AES for an encryption algorithm. Either is fine but AES has never failed to foil an attacker as it's super strong. The others get hit with performance penalties on slower systems .  6. Choose the size. Don't select a size too small if you're storing your  honeymoon HD videos inside .  7.  Now  comes  the  password.  The  longer  it  is,  and  more  random  with letters  and  numbers  and  symbols,  the  stronger  the  entropy  and  thus  the stronger the pass. Write it down if you must but never forget it. There's no retrieving it if you do .  8. Use your mouse to create a random key, which changes the more you move it. You don't have to do it more than a few seconds. The NSA could   spend years and years trying to figure out which direction you moved it first .  9. Now pick a file system, but realize if you're storing big files  4gig  and up , you'll need NTFS .  10. You're done! Now just click on the file you initially created. Input the pass, and pick the letter drive you want it to mount to. Then paste in your videos documents treasure. You won't be able to delete this container unless you unmount it, which can be done on the Truecrypt screen .  Passwords  A t this juncture I should probably answer a question I get quite frequently, which is :  "Help me! I forgot my password but... I know 15 out of the 20 or so character string and in order so... uh... what are my chances of hacking it ?" The answer is: Slim to none unless you have access to NSA resources, and even that is a long shot for a long password. Encrypted passwords are stored as "hash" files. When you hash a file, even if you change but ONE character in that string, the hash changes. The same is true of jpegs. Throw a picture into Gimp and apply a cool effect or tweak something small and voila. It's changed. Completely different hash set. Same with encryption .  Evil Maid Attack  T ruecrypt, like many other encryption apps, stores your encryption keys in memory  ram.  A  cold  boot  attack  can  possibly  siphon  this  if  the  ram  is dumped in the event of a raid or our Jamaican laptop thief gets access to your running operating system. If the former, they can cart off your PC still running and freeze the ram sticks and dump your keys - which contain your password! The thief, probably not. But an FBI team with a black van parked out front? You can bet the ranch on it. They're used to all kinds of lowlifes using encryption. Tax evaders. Counterfeit operations. Drug runners. Hells Angels gang members using PGP to communicate where the meth lab is .   The  takeaway  lesson  is  this:  Don't  leave  your  computer  running  with any encrypted containers mounted, as it will be dead simple to sniff your passwords from your ram. Unless of course, you break them in half - which in and of itself might be a obstruction of justice charge. Ten years ago this might  not  have  been  the  case  but  the  world  we  now  live  in  is  radically different.  It  demands  vigilance  on  the  part  of  would-be  patriots.  Always have a plan B .  Drivecrypt  D  rivecrypt  brings  back  a  lot  of  memories,  mostly  good.  It  was  my  first foray into proprietary encryption apps and seemed to offer nothing but good things in those early days .  These  days  though,  there  are  a  few  downsides  as  technology  has progressed about the same rate as exploits in the wild. One is that it's closed source and at over $100, it's not cheap. But it's got a great front end and extra goodies if you don't mind paying through the nose. It wasn't for me at the time. For me the bigger issue was if the NSA greased Securstar's palms enough   or  threatened   to  code  in  a  backdoor  for  the  government.  If  you visit their homepage, you'll see them swear up and down that that's not the case. In the end you'll have to decide for yourself whether or not they can be trusted. For what it's worth, they're based in Germany, not the USA. But if  there  were  a  conspiracy  then  it  wouldn't  matter  which  country  they operated in .  If you choose yes, know that the demo they offer does not offer strong encryption - only a weak AES key that gets upgraded to full strength if you buy it. I can't recommend Drivecrypt for these reasons :  1. Closed source 2. Pricey 3.  Bruce  Schneier  ,  a  respected  authority  on  all  things  security, mentioned  in  passing  after  the  Snowden  leaks  that  most  commercial applications  in  the  USA  "...probably  have  back  doors  coded  into  them." Probably,  he  said,  which  sounds  suspiciously  like  certainly  to  me.  He probably has no more proof of that than I do, but then you don't need to see   the  code  to  know  using  closed-source  is  a  risky  endeavor  after  the  NSA  and GCHQ  got caught with their pants down .  Veracrypt  V  eracrypt  is  probably  your  best  bet  if  Truecrypt  has  you  worried  about backdoors.  To  that,  even  I  have  to  admit  that  the  account  of  the  strange falling  out  by  the  development  team  had  me  worried  for  a  time.  Rest assured  Truecrypt  is  still  secure,  it's  just  not  as  secure  as  other  apps, depending  wholly  on  what  your  security  needs  are.  Plus,  later  volumes allow you to mount Truecrypt volumes .  So what's so great about it? Well, the developers of Veracrypt emulated the TrueCrypt 7.x code and made it stronger for one thing. Brute forcing is now much more difficult because of the iterations and enhancements added to it. Whenever you encrypt a hard drive partition using Truecrypt, it uses 1000  iterations  and  2000  for  your  containers.  But  Veracrypt  uses  a whopping  327,661  of  the  RIPEMD160  algorithm,  which  keeps  your password  and  safe  contents,  well,  safe.  For  encrypted  containers?  Almost double, at 655,331 iterations of SHA-2 encryption. The only performance penalty comes in at a somewhat slower time to unlock encrypted partitions, a fair tradeoff since it now makes it over three hundred times harder for a hacker to crack by brute force alone .  All of that, plus the user interface looks very similar to Truecrypt, so if  you're familiar with that GUI, there's not much of a learning curve at all .  Diskcryptor - With DiskCryptor you can encrypt any disk partitions or even your main system partition. Being open-source, it was intended as a replacement for Drivecrypt Plus Pack  a commercial closed-source app  and PGP  full  disk  encryption.  It  supports  AES-256,  Serpent  &  Twofish algorithms  with  the  encryption  key  being  stores  in  the  first  sector  of  a volume .  B enefits to using DiskCryptor when I compared two different systems :  - SHA-512 hash algorithm in Windows partitions - Quicker boot than Truecrypt or Drivecrypt Plus Pack   - No mandatory "Create Rescue Disk" like Truecrypt  see workaround   - Compiles easier than TC .  C ons to Using Truecrypt  1.  Discontinued. Probably the best reason to use Veracrypt, though it did pass a security audit which you can read about here . DiskCryptor as well does not use the same GUI like Truecrypt does, so you'll have to get used  to  learning  a  new  one.  Not  a  problem  for  most  but  I  tend  to  be stubborn about learning new any new GUI .  2.  Limited to RIPEMD-160 hash algorithm for Windows 3.  No support, no future security holes fixed 4.  A few motherboards  Gigabyte's Black Edition line  don't like it . UPDATE:  I  must  have  spent  a  month  trying  to  figure  out  why  the Linux-like BIOS of my Z97X-UD3H failed to boot after I'd input my TC password.  Customer  Support  laughed  as  they  knew  about  as  much  of Truecrypt  as  they  did  nuclear  waste  management   beyond  it  looking  like green radioactive goo leaking from a rusty barrel . In the end I chalked it up to a bad hard drive. THEN a month later, after further investigation, figured it due to having installed Drivecrypt on said hard drive at some point in the past  the demo . So use multiple encryption schemes on the same hard drive with caution .  LibreCrypt  L  ibreCrypt  is  open-source  disk  encryption  for  Windows  and  unlike  the above,  is  LUKS  compatible   formerly  DoxBox .  That's  a  big  plus  if  you like  to  dual-boot.  Even  better  is  that  it  supports  the  same  plausible deniability that Truecrypt does. It's listed on the features page as "Deniable encryption that protects you from 'rubber hose cryptography'  snicker! . If you don't know what that is, it's something like this ...  Other features include : - Easy to use, with a 'wizard' for creating new 'containers '. -  Full  transparent  encryption,  containers  appear  as  removable  disks  in  Windows Explorer .   -  Explorer  mode  lets  you  access  containers  when  you  don't  have  administrator permissions .  -  Compatible  with  Linux  encryption,  Cryptoloop  "losetup",  dm-crypt,  and LUKS. Linux shell scripts support deniable encryption on Linux .  - Supports smartcards and security tokens . - Encrypted containers can be a file, a partition, or a whole disk . - Opens legacy volumes created with FreeOTFE   BORDER OFFICERS AND ENCRYPTED LAPTOPS  B ringing any kind of guns or even knives across the Canadian border is a serious offense - at both ends. Marines have been arrested in Mexico with shotguns in the back of their pickup trucks and northward, cops have been arrested   yes,  cops!   for  failing  to  check  in  handguns.  Ever  since  Marc Lépine  shot  up  a  school  in  Montreal  way  back  in  1989  over  what  he perceived as feminists ruining his life, Canada has made it 1000 times more difficult to own a firearm .  Not  that  you'd  want  to  smuggle  one  in.  Canadians  are  notorious  for being friendly to outsiders. It's what lies in the likes of Banff Park or out in the Yukon that demands gun ownership the most: Polar bears. Grizzlies. A few smugglers here and there but they probably will leave you alone if you leave them alone .  And  on  that  topic,  smuggling  anything  into  Canada  requires  cunning unheard of, the likes of which Jabba the Hutt himself was never privy to. It's serious business .  And there's no end to crazy ideas, believe me. Stories in which officers  have relayed to their families probably number in the thousands .  One  involved  a  Canadian  teenager  who,  at  the  border,  sobbed  like  a little  baby  when  the  officer  asked  him  if  he  had  any  weapons.  Like  that 'Father,  I  confess!'  scene  from  The  Godfather,  the  kid  admitted  how  he'd gotten into some trouble down south at a bachelor party and found himself stuck  with  a  handgun  he'd  never  laid  eyes  on  before.  When  sent  to secondary checkpoint it turned out his gun was a BB gun. His 'friends' had played a delicious joke on him, telling him he'd killed a hooker. HA, good ol' Southern Comfort .   Anyway.  Let's  discuss  bringing  laptops  across  the  border  and  other electronic  devices  in  which  said  device  could  easily  make  or  break  your attempt at becoming invisible. Namely, what tips them off .  Contrary to popular belief, Border Officers on the Canadian side do not know your entire life history when they scan your passport. When you drive through a Canadian checkpoint, here is what happens :  Your passport is scanned  the part that has all the '<' left arrow symbols  using an international-standard that's easily readable by a CBSA language named  IPIL.  This  searches  through  law  enforcement  records  such  as outstanding warrants, both present and past. Beyond this, there's no time to go through every database with the lineup these guys deal with. It simply takes  way  too  much  time  as  planes  land  every  other  day  with  1000 Canadians who are eager to get home to some nice Timbits and Poutine .  Therefore,  the  shortcut  to  seeing  if  you're  a  criminal  or  not  isn't  by searching databases, as useful as they are  a seasoned criminal will know how  to  secure  false  passports  anyway .  The  way  to  tell  deception  is  by studying your behavior - Tics. Facial changes. Visual cues  where are you looking? DEA agents study where you look to see if you'll give up the drug location  after  a  raid .  Tone.  Hesitation.  Fidgeting.  Sometimes  a  smuggler will,  when  pressed  with  questions  by  a  Sam  Elliot  lookalike,  they  get nervous .  If you act nervous, the jig is up. And they know the difference between fatigue and nervousness. But for what it's worth, being an absolute jerk to the officer will not put you on any blacklist. They have to let you in as a Canadian since that is what the Canadian Charter dictates. What they don't have to let in is your stuff . So what will put you on the nasty list? These :  - Shipping drugs by mail - Refusing to report to secondary inspection - Lying  aka 'Making a False Declaration' which is admittedly a broad topic, and lies always travel faster than truths: If you lie to one officer in Vancouver, the one at Niagara Falls will know about it    - Having any bad history at the border So what else might tip off a BDO ? Not giving up your password. As stated, they'll let *you* through but not your beloved laptop. They do not need a warrant at all to search your phone Galaxy Tab Ipad .   So  then,  encrypt?  Yes!  By  all  means  but  you  should  have  a  hidden operating system because you absolutely, unequivocally want to give them *something* that makes you look like you have nothing to hide . You don't have to make yourself look like a schmuck. You simply have to look like a professional who values your privacy .  Solution  Y ou need to lock down your data prior to your border arrival. Designate a section of your hard drive so that it's encrypted out of an officer's plain sight and with a second encryption key. There you will store your private files. Do this even if you have full disk encryption. Diskcryptor offers this as well as most older encryption applications like PGP and Drivecrypt .  Border  officers  aren't  forensics  experts.  They  can't  go  through  your Windows or Linux directory to see you've got one encrypted file that's fifty gigs  in  size,  nor  that  you've  got  a  shortcut  to  it  via  menu  that  says 'Calculator'  which  even  has  the  stock  Windows  icon.  If  they  want  to "image"  your  hard  drive,  that's  no  sweat  off  your  back  as  long  as  your password is good .  Speaking  of  which,  try  to  drop  a  symbol  in  the  middle  of  your password.  Mix  it  up  with  upper lowercase  with  a  number.  Yes,  these  are harder to remember. To counter this you can use PasswordSafe .  If  you're  on  the  way  to  the  border  station  from  the  airport,  say  from Buffalo, NY to the Canadian Border Station at Niagara Falls, it might be too late to encrypt anything. So do it before you get on the plane. You need to have that decoy ready to show, with *recent* activity in case they want to boot up the OS. It will look suspicious if the decoy OS has not been used in a month. Perhaps not to every customs agent, but there may be one smart cookie in the batch who knows you can have a fake OS .  Store  nothing  incriminating  on  that  decoy  OS.  Vanilla  bookmarks   no social  media   only.  A  nice  backdrop.  Not  the  stock  install  wallpaper  that comes with Windows or Linux. Maybe a picture you took on vacation of all the Latina lovelies .  Once, while coming back from Manila to Canada  a back-breaking 22 hour  flight ,  I  stored  my  encrypted  container  in  my  camera,  one  that  the   border  agent  asked  for  directions  to  flip  through  the  pics.  He  saw  some beach pics I'd shot in Dumaguete but not the encrypted container on the SD card. They're not going to remove it with 20 cars behind you .   HIDING VALUABLES UNDERGROUND  T hings may get to the point where you must hide valuables underground. There's  nothing  particularly  unethical  about  this,  so  long  as  it  isn't  dead bodies  or  something  like  enriched  uranium  leaking  out  of  barrels. Regardless of what you store, know that anything can happen. You could get  get  mauled  by  Rottweilers  in  a  junkyard.  Who  knows  why  you'd  be there. Maybe looking for spare parts. Maybe to pay Uncle Spanky who runs the place a visit. And then what happens to your cache when you get buried six feet under? Right .  We can avoid a few problems if we follow a few self-imposed rules .  A void X Marks the Spot - This is a big one. Never mark the treasure cache spot  with  anything  unnatural.  No  arrows  in  trees  or  painted  rocks  with bright  and  yellow  smiley  faces  or  mini  "Stonehenges."  These  attract fraternity idiots. Idiots will damage the site - they will move things around when they call up other idiots to come and have a hot dog cookout... just before one of those drunken fools drops his cig near the base of the tree .  G  oogle  Earth  -  Use  Google  Earth  to  locate  the  exact  coordinates. Memorize  them  but  do  not  save  it  in  Google  Earth  unless  your  drive  is encrypted.  And  forget  about  using  that  Garmen,  too.  Some  models  save your history. Obviously this should not be on your property if what you're   burying is illegal  or if the IRS can take it . Always assume that someone will find it. Someone with a shiny badge and lots of time to kill .  I nsulation! - Take a hard drive apart, say an external one that's dead. See how dry it is? Now re-screw it and fasten. Then freeze it for awhile. After, put it out on the porch and then throw it in the freezer again. Open it a few hours  later.  Yeah,  condensation.  Lots  of  it.  This  happens  to  motherboards and ammo alike so bury beneath the frost line since moisture will kill any electrical component .  N o Water, No Problems! - Try not to bury valuables near streams, rivers or heaven  forbid,  swamps.  Think  "Up"  when  you  think  Underground. Escarpments and hills tend to make great spots but only at night unless it's out in the boonies. So do cemeteries  if you own one! . Bury it in a non- populated area with elevation enough that discourages daily visitors .  B ury It Naked - Avoid toting internet items with you whenever you visit your  sacred  spot.  That  means:  Tablets.  Phones.  Cameras.  Laptops.  Ipads. Watches that have WiFi  Apple . That also means ditching your car with the fancy-pants navigation system  one the cops will have fun tearing apart to see where you visited . Bike it if necessary. Silence is golden. To this, what works for me is to think "Zombies!" since the undead are attracted to loud noises like Camaro engines and big trucks, too. If in doubt, watch Walking Dead, Season 1 where one of the group steals a sport's car and the alarm goes off as he travels up to the hideaway camp. When morning comes, so does the zombie hoarde .   GOING TO EXTREMES  O ne day, your financial situation just might drive you to this :  L ooks tranquil, doesn't it ?  Almost like someplace a Bond villain might set up base camp, far away from the eyes of any intelligence agency. I sometimes meditate and dream of what I missed when I was walking along beaches like this not too long ago. Know where it is? I'll give you a hint. It isn't Bora Bora, though the turquoise  water  certainly  does  look  it.  It's  the  Philippines,  and  if  pictures could relay the Venus-like temps, the salty wind of the sea and the feel of a waif's  sticky  finger  slipping  into  your  pocket  to  filch  your  passport,  you might think twice about defecting there. A week-long vacation is one thing,   but to live there is a whole other world filled to the brim with it's own set of unique challenges .  You  could  want  to  leave  for  any  number  of  reasons,  and  they're probably  all  justified.  Your  student  loans  might  be  preventing  you  from securing employment or getting married. Perhaps you're divorce didn't go quite as stress-free as planned and now you're required to "maintain" your spouse's  lifestyle.  Or  it  could  be  you're  just  tired  of  driving  down  Main Street, USA and always looking over your shoulder for fear of being thrown in the can over a lousy expired brake tag .  There's  something  I  need  to  tell  you  about  exotic  places  like  this.  Something I learned that was ingrained into my very soul .  And it is this: Your problems follow you around like a stray puppy . No I don't mean your financial problems. Over there your student loans won't  mean  jack.  I  mean  your  personal  issues.  Anger  management. Jealousy.  Wanton  vandalism.  Piracy.  Alcoholism.  Cat  hoarder herder. Whatever  your  ethics,  whatever  your  spiritual  weakness,  it  will  not magically change overnight when you leave the West. Don't hightail it to escape a bad habit, be it gambling or drinking or cockfighting. You'll just run in a circle until you tackle the problem headon .  But you might find that you need to get away to an exotic place to heal yourself as you restart your life. That's darn near impossible to do if Betsy from SallieMae loans is constantly harassing your family every hour on the hour  and  Uncle  Frick  is  threatening  to  kick  you  to  the  curb  if  they  don't stop.  That's  no  way  to  heal.  That's  a  way  to  the  grim  reaper's  front  door. Now, we all meet death at some point, but there's no reason Betsy needs to accelerate it by giving you a heart attack .  Let's look at some destinations that might give you some time to reset  your dreams without the usual distractions .  Philippines  I t wasn't the sticker shock of the trip to Philippines that almost had me in tears   $1400   or  even  the  insanely  long  flight   18  hours .  It  was  the sweltering heat I had to deal with. I sweat like a stuck pig and burned like a roasted turkey on a spit under that Manila sun. Being raised in New Orleans   was  no  peace  of  cake  mind  you,  but  even  our  July  heat  was  nothing compared  to  this.  I  began  to  think  some  of  them  only  went  to  Mass  to escape it. Who could blame them? Certainly not the Almighty .  But I could see myself adapting, as I know you can, if you don't panic. Keep your wits about you. Think rationally about problems  something that seems lacking in Filipino culture and you'll see this if you use Google Earth to view their city grid layouts .  Life is slower there. Relationships are faster, much faster. By the fourth date your sweetie will be proposing. No lie. If you meet the parents, you're not getting out of her sight, ever, because she knows every filipina will be approaching you en masse .  There  are  other  issues,  too.  You  cannot  own  a  gun.  If  you're  a  white single male you will stick out like Marvin Martian in Bunkie, Louisiana. No country  is  more  networked  than  the  Philippines.  Gossip  reigns  supreme because of the social nature of the entire country .  And it really is a third world country in some parts. Lack of electricity. Lack of clean water, with Manila being the worst. But the women, heavens. You'll think you'd time-traveled to Hawaii in 1955. The level of attention I got was insane, and I'm no George Clooney either. I'm about as average Joe as they come. Walking through SM mall  as long as you don't resemble an ogre , you'll have massive numbers of women approaching you. If you are in  Davao,  Cebu,  Dumaguete,  or  pretty  much  anywhere  except  Manila  crime-ridden  and Zamboanga  terrorist central , this is a fact of life .  Unfortunately  this  brings  unexpected  attention  where  the  sweet, endearing Filipinas take lovely selfies of you eating by yourself and post it on  Facebook  and  Twitter  and  Instagram  before  joining  you.  Your  stalker may take notice if you use your real name with them. They may even do an image search and start some carnage there .  Solution ? A fake profile and persona if you go this route - different interests that go  along  with  that  shiny  fake  ID  and  fake  last  name,  fake  Facebook. Everything to use with the locals but never the government. A lockbox is useful for this .  Canada   R unning to Canada to escape student loan debt is one thing. Running for a crime like "kidnapping" your son is another .  If you want to run to Canada to escape a crime, forget it. It's the last place  you  want  to  be  unless  you  happen  to  be  Jeremiah  "liver  eating" Johnson and know how to trap beaver, scale a mountain and survive in sub- zero freezing temperatures .  That Canadian friendliness we see in John Candy's movies comes at a high price: They will hand you over with a side of Canadian bacon if U.S. authorities demand it. I've lived here for over twelve years and though the Canadian police  Toronto excluded  were far more polite and professional than any of my Cajun brethren down in Louisiana, I've never heard of any cases where they hand out asylum benefits like Willy Wonka bars. In fact, they don't grant asylum to Americans, period .  There's  a  funny  scene  in  the  film  Escape  From  New  York  where  Van Cleef's  character,  a  real  "hang  em  high"  supercop  kind  of  guy,  threatens Snake  Plisskan  with  death  if  he  so  much  as  thinks  of  turning  his  loaned police glider around and flying off to Canada instead of saving the President of the U.S.A  I nearly cracked a rib laughing as I thought, "How stupid does he think  Snake is ?"  Canada  would  dropship  poor  Snake  no  matter  what  crime  he'd committed. Oh they'd be nice about it, I'll grant you that. Maybe they'd send him back handcuffed in a coffin filled with a hundred bottles of delicious Canadian maple syrup Han Solo-style. After that, they'd throw in some Tim Horton's donuts. Ol' Van Cleef would've loved that, I'm sure .  So heed this advice: Canada is a no-fly zone if ever you're in serious, deep trouble. They turned over Mark Emery, eminent marijuana activist and he was one of their own .  Remember, just because a country does not have an extradition treaty  with the USA does not mean they will not extradite you .  Below  is  an  interesting  list,  where  you  will  stand  a  good  chance  of "disappearing," and in the case of a country like Syria, disappearance can be a whole other world of hurt if you don't have connections .  Afghanistan, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Armenia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus,  Bosnia,  Herzegovina,  Brunei,  Burkina  Faso,  Burma,  Burundi, Cambodia,  Cameroon,  Cape  Verde,  the  Central  African  Republic,  Chad, China,  Comoros,  Congo,  Djibouti,  Equatorial  Guinea,  Eritrea,  Ethiopia,   Gabon,  Guinea,  Guinea-Bissau,  Indonesia,  Ivory  Coast,  Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Laos, Lebanon, Libya, Macedonia, Madagascar, Maldives, Mali,  Marshall  Islands,  Mauritania,  Micronesia,  Moldova,  Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Niger, Oman, Qatar, Russia,  Rwanda,  Samoa,  São  Tomé  &  Príncipe,  Saudi  Arabia,  Senegal, Serbia,  Somalia,  Sudan,  Syria,  Togo,  Tunisia,  Uganda,  Ukraine,  United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Vatican, and Vietnam .  In the case of Cambodia, we saw they quite willingly handed over Pirate  Bay founder Gottfrid Svartholm to Sweden .  We saw Edward Snowden run to Russia when the heat was on, catching a  flight  from  Hong  Kong  and  later  requesting   and  being  granted  temporary asylum. We'll see if that pans out in the long term .  Fredrik  'Pirate  Bay'  Neij's  country  of  choice  was  Laos,  after  being sentenced to a whopping one year in a Swedish prison and ordered to pay  gasp   $905,000  in  "damages."  Laos  refused  to  hand  him  over.  Later  in November 2014, Neij was arrested on an Interpol warrant as he attempted to cross into Thailand .  Costa Rica may be another option. There have been a few high-profile cases of runners making it there but do your research beforehand. Know the differences  in  culture.  Know  the  history  of  extraditions  to  your  native country. Know how to get out fast if revolution starts. Everything safe costs money  so  you  need  to  have  a  substantial  savings  and  a  portfolio  that  is diversified.  This  is  so  that  no  one  bank  can  close  your  accounts  over something like student loans and wipe you out .  Thailand  W e left out  Thailand  in  the  above  list.  It's  a  nice  place  to  run  to  escape problems. Just not criminal problems. Putting aside their extradition treaty with the U.S., for one you need to speak Thai to stay there long term. Forget about what you heard on an expat forum that you can "get by" with English. No  matter  where  you  are  -  Bangkok,  Chiang  Mai,  Phukut,  you  need  the language  to  get  around  because  it's  hard  enough  being  a  stranger  in  a strange land without expecting everyone to know sign language. This is the   most  glaring  difference  between  Thailand  and  Philippines,  with  clothing being somewhat high priced .  T hailand Expenses  Rent is dirt cheap, with some places like Chiang Mai being cheaper than others. Bangkok is where most of the tourists hang out and for good reason. Better food than out in the provincial areas and far more reliable Internet. You can go to the website Numbeo.com to see a breakdown of just what you'd spend if you lived there. For 2015, this is what you'd likely be looking at :  R estaurants  average    Meal, Inexpensive Restaurant $1.48 Meal for 2, Mid-range Restaurant, Three-course $17.81 McMeal at McDonalds$4.45  U tilities   Monthly    Basic  Electricity, Heating, Water, Garbage  for Apartment $107.10 1 min. of Prepaid Mobile  No Discounts or Plans  0.04 Internet  6 Mbps, Unlimited Data, Cable ADSL  $18.82  C lothing  1 Pair of Jeans  Levis 501  $84.48 1 Summer Dress in a Chain Store  Zara, H&M, ...  $53.56 1 Pair of Nike Running Shoes  Mid-Range  $102.00  R ent Per Month  Apartment  1 bedroom  in City Center $589.57 Apartment  1 bedroom  Outside of Center $318.34 Apartment  3 bedrooms  in City Center $1,746.38   T wo things jump out at me when viewing the costs. One is the price for a nice  restaurant,  obviously  targeting  out-of-towners.  The  other  is  clothing. Clothing there is similar to what you pay in Philippines for electronics. Very expensive  for  the  average  Thai,  but  there  are  ways  around  this  since  you don't have to buy name brands .  A ll in all, it's  possible  to  live  there  on  $600  USD  per  month,  just  not  in style .  R eligion  This is also in stark contrast to the West, as most Thais are Buddhist. Not  only  that,  the  King  is  considered  a  kind  of  sacred  entity,  a  sort  of messianic figure, the kind you don't want to cross. If you are in a theater and the king is visible, you'll be required to stand like we do when we salute the flag at a baseball game. Only in America this is totally optional. You can even burn the flag in the States. This confuses the average Thai like no other .  In  2008,  a  woman  visiting  Thailand  refused  to  stand  in  respect  to  the king's image in a theater just before the film  The Other Boleyn Girl  began. Police had stated she appeared to be quite insane  Naturally only an insane person wouldn't bow or stand to a foreign king, right ?   That's  not  to  say  the  Thais  don't  have  a  sense  of  humor,  for  in  2012, Thailand police introduced Hello Kitty armbands as a way to shame certain officers  for  showing  up  late  or  getting  too  many  parking  tickets.  They discontinued this practice though when the world began to laugh  perhaps this was the whole point ?   That's just two examples of major differences that can cause problems if you don't know the culture. So immerse yourself in a few travel books or forums before you even think of going. You may inadvertently face a prison sentence for the crime of ignorance .   China  C hina is pretty big and easy to get lost in. Fortunately if you're dead set on running  here,  you  won't  have  to  worry  about  extradition  treaties  since mainland  China  has  none  with  the  U.S.  This  comes  in  handy  for whistleblowers like Snowden who leak classified documents .  China  can  veto  any  extradition  if  it  interferes  with  defense  or  public policy.  It's  all  a  bit  murky  to  be  honest.  On  a  technical  level,  yes,  Hong Kong  has  an  extradition  treaty  with  the  U.S.  but  that  was  before  Great Britain gave control of Hong Kong over to the mainland. In interviews, it's been crystal clear even Snowden felt this was just too much of a grey area to  risk  staying  in  the  country  long  term.  Not  that  he  wanted  to  stay  in Moscow since that was where he was when the passport got yanked  no pun  .  D isappearing in China - The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly  This  is  easier  said  than  done.  It's  easy  to  flee  there,  sure,  but  hard  to disappear. Very hard. Americans abroad tend to acquire an affliction there ten  times  quicker  than  even  in  the  Philippines.  It's  called  "Rock  Star" affliction. And once you've got it, it's brutally hard to get rid of since the celebrity factor alone hits your ego first. Any thoughts on being a humble little shepherd go out the window after a day or so off the plane .  Ethnic diversity isn't really as widespread in China as some westerners think. You will stick out like Big Bird if you are not Chinese, and if you are of the Dutch blonde hair blue eyes variety of westerner, you'll be as visible as Big Bird would be traveling with those little green aliens from Toy Story. Believe it .  The picture taking is the most obvious. Cute at first, it will quickly grate on your nerves as many Chinese will ask you, "Take picture of my baby?" many times when you go out and about. Only after three or four of these in a week, you'll begin to suspect a conspiracy. Well, it sort of is. They like your white skin ,  for  starters.  You'll  even  get  special  attention  by  teenage schoolgirls  who  will  try  and  spy  on  you  while  hoping  their  giggling girlfriends don't give them away as they twirl their Hello Kitty purses. More conservative areas will yield less obvious giggling  behind curtains instead   of telephone poles , but the effect is the same: It's impossible to blend in without actually speaking Chinese and knowing Chinese culture .  Then  come  the  questions.  From  everyone.  In  Japan  they  call  them "Gaijin  lovers"   foreigner  lovers   and  these  nice  yet  quirky  and  strange beings will come up to you in Tokyo  or anywhere else in Japan  and launch wave  after  wave  of  data  mining  questions.  In  China  this  happens  as regularly as the sun coming up. Again, cute at first but it quickly becomes an annoyance after the twentieth stranger comes up to you and asks :  - Is true all Americans own Glock like John Wayne ? - Is Texas like Seinfeld ? - You have beautiful wife yet? Our city offer you many pretty wives ! -  Are  alien  UFO  really  in  Nevada?   hint:  Don't  tell  them  it's  in  New  -  You  has  rose  tattoo  like  all  Americans,  yes?  I  can  see?   eyes  your  - You has Hells Angels in family? Show photos!  begs you to take out  Mexico    crotch    wallet    Rudeness  N ow for some of the bad and the ugly .  This  mainly  applies  to  Hong  Kong  and  other  metro  areas  where  the ancient god Mammon rules with an iron fist. Bare in mind that not every one is like this. Only a few rotten eggs that spoil it for everyone else. But like  I  said,  when  discussing  rudeness  and  the  Chinese  with  an  Indian, Pakistani,  African  or  Filipino,  they  in  all  likelihood  will  think  of  Hong Kong as number one on the list .  Deep breath . The  horking  and  spitting  and  public  flatulence  was  bad  enough,  but worse  than  this  was  that  few  trash  cans  could  be  seen  anywhere.  If  there were, I didn't see any  or maybe they're just too expensive . This is in stark contrast to Japan, where throwing your Coke can on the ground is seen as slapping the Prime Minister's face. Japanese love foreigners and they want as  many  visitors  as  possible.  So  for  this  reason  their  streets  are  sparkling clean .   In fact, you'd be hard pressed to even see garbage in a subway or even a  busy city street in metro Tokyo .  But in China? Friend you don't know rudeness until you've been down a busy HongKong street at rush hour. Think New York is bad? It's not. Hong Kong is like Seinfeld's "Bizarro World" where up is down and down is up and Superman is evil. And believe me when I say I'm no neat freak. But even I had expectations that had to be adjusted accordingly .  As  you  may  have  guessed  at  this  point,  rudeness  make  disappearing problematic.  Americans,  myself  included,  tend  to  go  Wyatt  Earp  when confronted  with  rudeness  overseas.  This  causes  problems  for  anyone wanting to disappear because it draws massive attention to yourself. Thus, if there is one thing I learned, it's that when in HongKong, turn the cheek if at all possible .  A friend of mine relayed what he'd seen once on a weeknight at a high- end restaurant whereby the waiter, who was obviously nursing a hangover as he applied every other ice cold drink to his forehead in between taking orders,  suddenly  horked  his  lunch  all  over  the  floor.  After  cleaning  it  up, this waiter doesn't bother to go to the restroom to wash up! He simply took a mop to the floor, pushed the bucket back into the corner of the place and resumed taking orders with the same filthy hands he'd horked with. That's pretty tame, though next to other incidents I've heard .  In Hong Kong, the mad rush to earn money there is, well, maddening. Far more than even Wall Street exhibits. People ram right into you in Hong Kong  in  the  middle  of  the  street  without  blinking.  They  seem  allergic  to apologizing.  They  don't  even  blink  if  you  slip  and  fall.  They  merely continue as if they were a couple of medics getting shot at on the beaches of Normandy and you're in the way. Foreigners have been almost run over by cabs that would've stopped or at least honked had it been New York .  Again, mostly in Hong Kong. Provincial areas are far more hospitable but  even  there  you  may  find  a  woman  saying  you  "are  too  fat"  if  you've been on a date with her. This isn't rudeness to them. It's just honesty .   COUNTERFEITING  C ounterfeit items are everywhere in China. The Philippines unfortunately gets a lot of it sent to them because it's cheaper. Cheap shirts that rip in two weeks.  Cheap  Chinese  electronics   phones,  tablets,  etc   that  break  within two months. Iphones that aren't Iphones. Hard drives that seem to have been made from twigs and fish bones that croak after a week of use .  Souvenirs  as  well  are  hit  and  miss.  You'll  see  items  sold  in  antique stores that cost far below what they'd really sell for if they were even 10% authentic.  Statuettes  fall  into  this  category  and  it  is  easy  to  get  suckered. They know how to replicate the look and feel of something old. Something dusty  and  archaic  and  webby.  They  may  charge  you  $100  for  something like a vase that they claim is from 8th century China. If that were the case, the price would be closer to ten grand. Not kidding. This goes on all over China,  where  counterfeit  goods  fool  naive  visitors  every  year.  If  you're going drop major cash on a statue, ensure it is appraised by someone you trust implicitly before laying your cash across the counter .  The Disappearing Act  A  s  you  can  imagine,  the  cameras  everywhere  being  pointed  in  your direction is catastrophic to anonymity. A disguise might prove embarrasing  and  possibly  attract  the  attention  of  law  enforcement   if  your  mustache falls off in front of a crowd of gawking Chinese. They may whisper ,  "Is he a spy ?"   "Why did he dye his hair ?" "Why she feel need to wear a wig ?" "Should I tell someone ?" This  in  addition  to  the  fact  most  of  those  photos  may  end  up  online somewhere.  Nevertheless,  here  are  some  things  you  might  consider. They've helped me whenever that 'Stranger in a Strange Land' feeling came over me .  I .  Learn a basic level of Chinese and they will forgive just about anything you  do  short  of  stealing  nuclear  launch  codes.  You  can't  travel  incognito well without it anyway, so learn the basics of how to get around - how to rent cars, hotels, how to read maps, open a savings account, check into a B&B,  order  a  steak  at  a  restaurant...  And  try  to  be  compassionate  with Chinese culture. It is not rude for them to say "You're getting fat!" like it is in  America.  It's  like  saying,  "You're  a  little  sunburned"  to  someone Stateside. But it is *very* rude for a Chinese woman on a subway to mutter "hei gue"  black devil  to you if you're black. It's quite the catch-22 if you know Chinese and want to call her out publicly on it. If you do, chances are good her eyes will well up with tears and beg for your forgiveness .  I I.  Rock Star Status gets  old  believe  it  or  not.  Read  any  interview  with Steven Tyler or Garth Brooks and you'll see that even those heavyweights grow weary of it after awhile, as will you. To that, don't assume that since everyone  is  taking  *your*  picture  that  it's  okay  to  take  everyone  *else's* picture. Keeping a low profile is okay but not to the extreme, which may arouse suspicion as well .  I II.  Talk With Your Hands - If you don't speak Chinese, don't shoot a pic of a local Chinese guy without doing some sign language to ask first  point to him, then to the camera, then smile  .   I  V.   Be  assertive  and  say  NO  when  necessary.  Learn  how  to  say  it  in Mandarin and learn not to worry about hurting their feelings. Some Chinese students  once  asked  to  snap  a  picture  of  me  because  I  am  6'2  and  have vampire-white  skin   this  was  just  outside  the  French  Quarter  near  the  St. Louis  Cathedral .  I  calmly  told  them  my  vampire  clan  would  be  upset  if they  ever  found  out  I  was  walking  around  in  the  daytime  since  it  was against the clan's rules, and likely come after who shot the picture. Their eyes grew as big as dinner plates .  "Vampires?! Ooh !" Snap. Snap. Snap. Snap .   CIA MANIPULATION AND DISAPPEARING  J ason Bourne and James Bond are a bit of a joke to CIA agents. Unrealitsic is being too kind. If agents had half of the gadgets Bond uses, their offices would be filled with resumes from every city in the U.S. But to the rest of us normal guys, there's nothing funny about Bond being sliced in half by a laser or Brosnan resurrecting his heartbeat  Die Another Day  .  Well, maybe the latter. A little . They're  spies  we  want  to  emulate,  fair  enough,  but  sadly  a  lot  of methods  of  disappearing  into  thin  air  don't  translate  well  from  the  silver screen to reality. In fact, the real deal is often quite different .  What you see in True Lies and the Bourne movies that gets the bad guys usually ends up with a CIA agent shaking his head in the theater. It's just not  done  that  way.  Not  usually.  In  the  past,  CIA  techniques  relied  on deception - deceiving the target's mind with psychology - false trails, leads, and  lies,  lies,  lies,  but  that's  less  common  today.  These  days  it  is  about intense networking and analyzing and tracing and focusing, getting as much data as you can and all while being as quiet as a church mouse. Boring stuff for James Cameron and Michael Bay .  Yes, you do learn a lot of survival techniques that, for a few moments, might resemble something Bond did on a bad hair day in Madrid, but it's rare. And if it comes down to you chasing a terrorist mastermind through traffic while riding a horse that leads you to the top of the Marriott, well, forget  it.  You're  beyond  sloppy.  The  visibility  factor  alone  would  make world headlines. Attention whoring x 1000 = Mission Failed .   Manipulation Tactics  B  ack  when  I  ran  online  ad  campaigns   my  first  business  failure ,  I manipulated people left and right without even realizing it. Every day .  I'd  fire  up  CPV  Lab  on  my  server  and  spend   and  lose   thousands running  ads  for  affiliate  companies  like  Neverblue  and  Clickbank  while buying  traffic  from  TrafficVance  and  LeadImpact.  Not  cheap,  but  once  I split-tested two ads enough to see my sales skyrocket, I was hooked . This was effective manipulation. Giving people what  they think  they need in exchange for something I wanted : a nice income stream .  Corporations  do  this  all  the  time.  Sears.  Target.  Wal-Mart.  Best  Buy. They're artists at it. But what you find works in the USA might not work in Canada .  Point  being?  Don't  hesitate  to  manipulate  if  it's  required  to  keep  you invisible. A good CIA agent will have zero problems with manipulation if it means it will push the mission objective forward - that is, one step closer to completion. Best Buy does this, and they have pretty atrocious pricing on many items, not the least of which is the worthless extended warranty they pressure you into buying .  So why do more people shop there instead of a smaller PC repair shop? The  answer  is  manipulation,  and  it  isn't  that  different  than  what  the secretive CIA does. This doesn't mean you have to be a brown-noser. Just know how to manipulate without giving valuable intel about your past away .  Forging Allies  T he CIA does not like to make pure enemies. They like to make allies . They  like  to  forge  alliances.  To  this  end,  they  spend  tons  of  money  on operations  that  find  common  ground  with  pseudo-enemies  and  accelerate common  goals.  Suppress  the  bad  and  elevate  the  good,  which  they  hope will turn into a nice, flowery friendship .  Then they send in spies . The  Soviets  liked  to  do  it  this  way,  only  they  employed  far  more evilness in the implementation of it all. Subversion was the name of their   game.  Specifically,  subversion  tactics  to  undermine  the  stability  of  a country. The moral fabric if you will. You know, kill patriotism or any kind of  idealism  that  could  unify  a  country  against  outside  enemies.  It  really mattered little what it was that got under people's skin as long as it drove them to fight each other, and that was good enough .  The KGB defector Yuri Bezmenov relayed this expertly and perhaps as ominously as Jonah did to the inhabitants of Ninevah, but with compassion and  a  dire  warning  to  the  West.  Manipulation  and  deceit  are  the  tools  of darkness. Devastatingly effective yet as dangerous to deploy as a suitcase nuke. Eventually, things start falling apart .  He laid it out like a strategic battle plan at Midway in his "Love Letter to  America,"  how  everything  the  KGB  did  to  undermine  western democracy  and  freedom  as  you  know  it  was  put  above  all  else.  The interview  from 1983  is quite telling and even shocking in some parts of the telling of it, how the Russians would invite every diplomat to mother Russia, get them drunk, plastered, pickled and primed for a lie, then paint a rosy picture of how pretty and flowery Russia was, both the people and her politicians .  Only it wasn't . Prisons  were  turned  into  nurseries  overnight.  Spies  and  liars  tricked every  reporter  that  came  around  shooting  for  LIFE  and  Time.  Magazine spreads portrayed the entire country as victims of the evil U.S. capitalistic empire, yet Russia bore it all like a messiah wearing a crown of thorns, with smiling faces and vigorous "happy" handshakes living under the benevolent Soviet government .  And we know how that story ended. The Soviet Union broke up. The lesson, I believe, for anyone contemplating disappearing in a free country, is this :  Have  Ethics.  Have  a  moral  base  and  keep  your  manipulation  tactics sane so that, Heaven forbid you are caught red-handed, you won't be strung up from the nearest tree by your compatriots. Not to sound too preachy here but, God is watching, after all, and sees what lies in a man's heart. Things that  cannot  be  legislated.  Sew  your  relationships  to  your  advantage, certainly, but don't sacrifice your soul to do so .   HOW THE NSA FINDS ANYONE  Y our physical location is easy to track if you're predictable. To that, most of us are. Maybe 90% of us .  Think about it . We wake up at the same hour and place most days. Wear the same style of  clothes  every  season.  Shop  at  the  same  retail  outlets.  Visit  the  same places come Memorial Day. Date the same type of people even if they aren't our dream dates  for me, redhead librarians with glasses . Married people? Forget it. You're not getting off the NSA radar without good security .  Cell Towers  C ell phone grids are a bit like computers in that they need to know where you  are  in  order  to  "talk"  to  you.  Networked  computers,  too,  need  IP addresses. Without 'em, there's zero communication since it has nowhere to send the data packets. Same with cell networks. Cell geolocation is required to send you your stuff; Skype, emails, Warcraft pings. Doesn't really matter what kind it is, but know this: The NSA prefers you favor convenience over security since breaching security is harder for them. If massive numbers of people  put  convenience  above  security,  well  that's  all  the  more  power  in their hands. They win, you lose .  But triangulation is really nothing new. It's just that now they've refined it, looped it, hacked it and mangled it in such a way that it's now intertwined with emergency services. Case in point: you're a hiker whose dog gets stuck   in a cliff crevice with no way back up. Remember what Ben Franklin said about liberty and security ?  "Those who sacrifice a little liberty for security deserve neither ." And  no  two  ways  about  it.  It's  easy-peasy  for  the  NSA  to  tap  your private  data  either  by  listening  in  or  CEO-inked  backroom  deals.  At  any rate it's pretty darn easy for them to narrow their scope to a particular GSM phone given the number of towers everywhere. From their lips to your eyes :  "GSM  Cell  Towers  can  be  used  as  a  physical-geolocation  point  in  relation to a GSM handset of interest ."  They also use drones .   DRONES  AND HOW TO DEFEAT THEM   A bove, a U.S. Customs Patrol Drone .  If you're trekking across the border and wondering whether or not you'll see  a  drone  20,000  feet  up,  chances  are  you  won't.  It  isn't  just  the  sheer height  of  the  blasted  things  that  are  the  problem.  It's  how  easily  Mother Nature  tends  to  obscure  their  flight  patterns  with  clouds,  fog,  and thunderstorms, making any anti-drone technology an exercise in frustration. This in addition that they fly soundless. Silent killers in the night sky. How would you know a twinkling star from one flying overhead ?  But fear not, there are a few measures we can deploy, er employ . 1.  Sensor Disruption -  Any  technology  with  sensors  needs  to  see  the target it's trying to capture. So give it a dose of it's own medicine: lasers. Ever wonder why a kid with a laser-pointer gets a visit from the FBI when he  points  it  at  the  cockpit  of  a  747  flying  overhead?  Right  -  the  laser   disrupts  not  only  the  instruments  onboard  but  the  visibility  of  the  pilots. Blind pilots cannot fly straight nor can they read their navigation systems. Same with drones, and though pilotless, have cameras that relay images to a set of human eyeballs. The downside of course is that you make it all too obvious that you're not some kid with the kitty's laser-pointer .  2 .  Hacking - This is far easier said than done. It used to be that drones could be hacked just as flight navigation systems on a 747 can be hacked, but  it's  harder  to  do  now  with  encryption.  The  movie  Interstellar  goofed. Matthew  McConaughey's  character   with  his  daughter's  help   hack  into  a drone flying overhead from years ago. Only it looks all too easy because there is no encryption to hack past. Years prior to the film's release, North Korea  and  Iran  both  claimed  to  have  downed  drones  using  hacking techniques whereby they "spoof" the GPS signal and, as irony would have it, send it on a suicidal death spiral .  3 .  EMP Pulse - The problem with this is that even if you could create this by yourself, the pulse cares not a whit about your own electronic equipment or grid. So it'd be like shooting yourself in the foot. Actually, worse. Recall the MAD tactic  mutually assured destruction  Trinity used in The Matrix just  as  the  A.I  machines  were  drilling  into  the  Morpheus'  ship:  The Nebuchadnezzar, with Neo and Morpheus still jacked in. She hit the switch and fried every bot but left her ship defenseless. They all lived, however, an in the end it may just come to that for us .  4 .  Counter-Drones - This requires downed drones, of course, unless you manufacture your own. Set these drones to survey the skies for unfriendlies and scan and identify via encryption keys the same way that PGP users do over the internet. The issue of course is that the enemy can see these just as you can see theirs... unless you've got decoys set up to give off fake heat signatures .   5 .  Occupy The High Ground - For this to work you'd need teams specially trained and camouflaged to lookout for drones all day, all night, armed with microwave-type weaponry. The microwave itself  You'd  also  need  powerful  scopes  to  distinguish  a  drone  from  a  plane which  is  not  discernable  to  the  naked  eye  even  from  high  up.  As  well, noise-sensors would be required that detect the low-hum engine noise from a drone, assuming of course you knew the make model of said drone .  6 .  Camouflage - No I don't mean like the Ghillie suit used in Call of Duty 4,  but  rather  the  natural  camouflage  given  by  large  structures.  Shadows, bridges covered in vines, that sort of thing. Just remember that traveling at night is risky no matter what you're wearing since the drone will detect your heat  signature  anyway.  Better  to  stick  to  tunnels,  under  bridges,  railroad tracks  and  moving  building  to  building,  cover  to  cover  as  a  disguise  had other uses. This is of course assuming you know how to travel incognito as you might be in enemy territory. If you can blend in with what the drone considers 'non-adversaries', then it will not be able to distinguish between you and Vladmir. The downside is if that drone is using facial recognition tech,  whereby  they  can  match  your  face  with  what  they  have  on  file.  If you're a wanted man, better wear a hood, makeup, beard or whatever you need to look thinner or fatter than you really are. That also goes for your voice.  Learn  accents  because  advanced  Voice  DNA  technology  is  willing and able to turn you in .  7 .  Radar - This is the expensive option. But at thirty thousand feet, you're not  going  to  see  a  drone  without  expensive  equipment  and  if  you're dropping money like Ebenezer Scrooge, well you might as well go all the way .  E ven if you were to step outdoors and see a trail from a jet liner, it will be as a tiny sliver even on a clear, sunny day. Rain and fog? Forget it. So you need radar installations that are secret enough to evade enemy detection but close enough to see the enemy. Quite the catch-22. Detecting the drone is   easier than detecting it anonymously. There are CO2 infrared lasers you can buy from various internet outlets .  8  .   Civilian  Patriots  -  Obvious  perhaps,  as  there  are  over  a  million  gun owners  in  North  America,  but  it  is  unlikely  that  drones  will  be  turned against  the  populace  en  masse  anytime  soon  since  they  must  be  rearmed and refueled, and a patriotic force would seize this opportunity to string the pilots  up  from  the  nearest  tree.  And  believe  me,  they  would  find  them quickly .  B ut drone spying is different than a drone firing . And in the end, perhaps that is really all they want - to launch a hundred thousand drones to spy on everyone  without  ever  firing  a  shot,  because  when  you  know  where someone  is  24 7,  what  restaurant  they  eat  at,  what  ballgames  they  attend and whether they put their ketchup on top of their fries or on the side, well, they don't really need to fire from the skies, do they ?   ONLINE FOOTPRINTS  T he NSA collects IP addresses like ants collect food. It's a nice analogy, isn't  it?  They  store  whatever  they  can  get,  usually  from  apps  that  bypass security and provide you with convenience. Apple and Samsung made their fortunes this way - convenience above all. Thus many phone apps not only send  your  IP  address  which  is  correlated  with  Facebook  and  Skype,  but your  login  locations:  cafes,  libraries,  etc.,  with  the  times  you  did.  Thus everyone's digital fingerprint is stored. Well, most people's. If you're one of the ones that are tracked, read on, because we're about to put a stop to that nonsense .  Fortunately,  an  IP  address  is  not  a  person  yet  .  On  that  topic,  ask yourself this: how might their power be enhanced if everyone did have their own unique number, say like those in Germany, 1938? To login? To send email? To play online games ?  I walked into a free WiFi on a trip to California a few years back. A few kids had managed to play World of Warcraft despite the posted rules of NO GAMING  during  school  hours.  Well,  the  NSA  certainly  knows  which games their playing, and who played them at which hour if they decide to go  the  subpoena  route.  This  is  how  the  NSA  finds  people  who  want  to disappear .  People on the run forget the digital trail they've already established for years.  The  NSA  hasn't.  Sites  you've  visited.  Calls  you've  made.  Friends you've unfriended. They know about them all. So if you want to put an end to this, you must forge a new identity that muddles up the former digital you .   And  no,  turning  off  the  cell  won't  help.  Neither  will  popping  out  the SIM because the NSA already has the network map for that WiFi area. The only exception to this would be if you were in Syria .  Bin Laden's Courier  S heikh Abu Ahmed was not an easy man to find. The CIA spent a year tracking him down, and Bin Laden's rule of no calls or laptops made it all the more difficult. So difficult in fact, that they had to rely on getting intel out of prisoners .  The big break, however, came in 2010 when Ahmed broke Bin Laden's rule  by  talking  about  him  on,  you  guessed  it,  a  cell  phone  .  Intelligence agencies were already monitoring who he was talking to. When Bin Laden's name  came  up,  the  call  led  them  straight  to  the  Pakistani  town  called Abbottabad .  You probably know the rest . Soon thereafter, Navy SEALs stormed the compound with 18 foot walls and barbed wire. They were in and out in under 40 minutes and met little resistance. There were no guards or schedules. No guard dogs. No field of tripmines and no Barrett .50 caliber guns to worry about. Not much in the way  of  fortification  that  couldn't  be  easily  defeated  with  a  moderately trained infantry. Or a sledgehammer in the case of one SEAL .  The takeaway here is that you don't want to draw attention to yourself by being loud. If you want to truly disappear, don't be a bar braggart. Bin Laden, for all his demonic activity, had this part right. C4 is loud. Mines are suicidal. Tripwires can kill your own and sentry guards are visible from the sky. They're also notoriously loose-lipped as they gossip to kill time .  Despite  knowing  all  this,  I  watched  Zero  Dark  Thirty  expecting  the worst.  I  facepalmed  several  times  due  to  how  loud  the  actors  playing  the Navy SEALs were .  "Shut up you fools or someone'll hear! Stop chattering !" Bin laden was smart. Prime evil, but smart . Chatter breaks anonymity faster than a maggot spoils rotten meat, and sometimes  Hollywood  gets  it  wrong.  Those  SEALS   the  real  ones   knew how to be silent. In fact it's the very thing they do best. They'd prefer to get   in  and  out  and  then  blow  the  place  sky  high...  as  they're  running  to  the beach .  If there is one thing that will put a silver bullet in your disappearing act,  it's blabbing about your old life .  "I  sure  showed  the  IRS!  Those  turkeys  won't  bother  me  ever  again!" you say just a little too loudly in Bangkok, piquing the interest of a former IRS tax agent a few stools down .  Bottom line: You should value your new identity as though it were your  life, because, well, it is. Treat it as such. Loose lips and all .  Restrict Physical Access  N ever trust anyone with  your  laptop  overseas.  If  you  loan  it  out,  ensure you're there as they use it .  Inside your laptop lies the heart and soul of your business. Break it off with a vengeful Thai girl and she can do a lot more than just the battery- acid-to-the-face on the other girl. She can ruin you. Thus, you must encrypt your operating system. You needn't go as far as Bin Laden did and avoid laptops altogether, but you need to be aware that comfort breeds mistakes, and costly ones at that .  If you're a freelancer, an author, or just have an online side hustle, guard your  passwords  and  pen  names  like  they  were  the  keys  to  Heaven  itself. Never give too many details, especially to strangers. Last thing you want is a string of bad  fake  reviews from every one of her Thai brothers calling you  a  white  hot  ball  of  canine  terror  who  plagiarizes  and  eats  freckled pigtailed girls .  Want to stay invisible? Don't give out your last name .  Preserve Your Reputation  E ver watch Game of Thrones? I did, right up until they offed poor Ned at the  end  of  Season  1.  But  a  line  from  Tyrell  stuck  with  me:  A  Lannister always  pays  his  debts.  So  should  you.  And  no  I  don't  mean  your  student loans.  I  mean  debts  to  friends  and  family  and  other  alliances,  other   businesses. Local, unpaid debts make enemies fast . Enemies can poor a can of  puke-yellow  paint  all  over  your  invisibility  act.  Imagine  poor  Bilbo standing there in front of all those guests covered in yellow goop .  Cut Them Loose  T his means cutting loose someone who is unstable and detrimental to your stability - the same stability you worked hard to obtain. Financially unstable people  tend  to  borrow  without  asking.  Mentally  unstable  people  tend  to embarrass and stalk until you until your house is burning down to the riff of Ozzy .  This  requires  saying  no  .  In  some  cases  it  requires  firing  someone  in your  life  who  makes  a  lot  of  noise  flapping  their  gums   remember  Bin Laden's courier? . A maid with sticky fingers, too, can be catastrophic, but still easier to fire than your live-in girlfriend. Better to suffer a bruised ego for a day than lose a business... and clients .  When I dated a filipina in Dumaguete, it was expected of me to bring a gift  to  her  brother's  birthday  party.  She  wanted  me  to  buy  him  an  Ipad.  I nearly choked to death on my cashews .  "Can't you afford it?" she slyly asked. "Sure can. But I'm not your white  ATM," I sternly replied .  I  hurt  her  feelings,  true  enough,  but  spared  myself  the  expense  of buying all her relatives electronic gadgets that cost $300-400 per item on all future  social  engagements.  Later  I  found  this  to  be  common  no  matter where one is in the Philippines. They all think you're rich if you are there since a plane ticket costs an arm and a leg .  Yep, if you can pay a grand for a ticket to Asia, you're rich buddy. Bill  Gates rich .  Risky Friendships  W hen you are a stranger in a strange land, it can be tempting to accept any and all friendships that fall into your lap. You've got a shiny new identity. You feel more alive than ever before. No debts. No criminal past. No angry   ex looking to string you up from the nearest tree if you don't fork over two grand by the end of the month .  Then you meet someone at a convention and offer a beer after you forge a connection. He smiles with a row of perfect teeth. Nods and hmms and offers  expert  marketing  advice.  You  think,  "Gee,  this  guy  appears  to  be intelligent  and  business-minded.  I  like  him.  Could  make  for  a  decent business partner ."  After all, you could always use more clients as a digital nomad, right? Only later you find out he runs a tranny dating website for Thais and wants you to "meet someone to discuss better ways to attract clientele ."  I'm sure you know the risks of such a scenario .   SNOWDEN'S MISTAKES  E dward Snowden .  The man is an interesting character study as to how far a single human  will go on personal ethics alone .  He  had  insisted  from  the  very  beginning  that  he  believed  the  NSA's surveillance programs to be in violation of the U.S. Constitution, and that the  people  who  founded  that  Constitution  ought  to  know  about  them. Nothing good, he said, ever came from keeping tax-funded programs in the dark from the taxpayers themselves .  He  also  claimed  that  he  never  intended  to  hide  his  identity   after running of course . What can we learn from his mistakes? What not to do if we decide to disappear ?  M istake 1: Moscow  It was WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange that provided for Snowden's stay in Hong Kong, even recommending that he not go to South America on account  of  the  physical  danger  to  himself.  Not  that  the  place  is  paradise since the general instability of the area makes for a miserable experience in a lot of cities, cartels included .  So as luck would have it, he ended up in Russia when his passport was  yanked .  And  it  isn't  even  what  Snowden  said  that  is  most  appealing  to  the Russians.  Rather,  it's  what  he  did  not  say  -  those  unwritten,  unspoken matrix of secrets that are a veritable gold mine for Russian Intelligence. It's   a good bet that if Washington ever offers him a plea deal and allows him back on American soil, we will see the same stalling behavior we saw with Putin's decision. They'll not give him up so easily. Quite the catch-22 .  M istake 2: One Passport  With  the  kind  of  security  clearance  Edward  had,  getting  a  second passport in a country friendly to the United States should have been easy peasy.  Yes,  said  country  would  certainly  have  handed  him  over,  but  not without at least a delay that might have granted him more time. The U.S. government will know it if you do, but it is not a foregone conclusion that they  would  be  revoked  simultaneously.  If  that  were  the  case,  we'd  all  be living under One Government by now  Thank Heaven for small miracles  .  M istake 3: Facetime  Facetime  kills  anonymity  quicker  than  anything  else.  This  nail  in  the coffin  had  a  two  prong  effect:  The  first  being  that  of  honesty.  Snowden could  address  the  American  public  without  there  being  any  doubt  to  the validity  of  his  identity.  If  he'd  stayed  anonymous,  he'd  have  always struggled with proving who he was and that his words rung true .  The  mistake  of  course  comes  in  on  that  second  effect:  The  FBI  now knew his face. Eventually the NSA would have nailed him even if he hadn't gone public, but it might have given him more time since Snowden's appeal could very well have dragged out any extradition request .  Takeaway: Don't flee to a country that will do you more harm than the country you are fleeing from . True, we see Edward as living a somewhat normal,  if  modest  life  in  that  sprawling  ex-Soviet  country...  but  that  life may one day be short lived .  When the dust settles, and the interviews by comedians cease, and we no longer hear of Snowden or WikiLeaks, we might just have missed the disappearing  act  of  Putin  deciding  to  be  a  little  more  forceful  in  gaining access to that vault of secrets between Edward's ears. Don't let that be you .   DEFEATING FACIAL RECOGNITION  TECHNOLOGY  I 'm not Spiderman, and I'd wager you're not Quicksilver from the X-Men  mutant kid who can run 200mph and push bullets around like Skittles  .  Let's  be  honest  for  a  moment.  I  don't  care  for  the  government  using much of any kind of facial-scan technology to measure how many steps it takes me to go to the gym or if I'm whistling a copyrighted tune out of my backside after eating a bowl of Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs .  Nor can I  legally, anyway  take a double-bladed axe to all of the traffic  cams in the city where I live. So what can I do? What can you do ?  First off, let's not panic since we have some credible legal options. Let's also discuss what it is and what it is not and where it is going to be a decade out .  Facial recognition is not Star Trek technology, nor is it a perfect way to spot a kidnapper or merely spy on Uncle Frick. And rest assured that for the rest of us, there are flaws that can be exploited. When you hear about facial recognition  technology  such  as  that  used  by  social  networks,  what  they really refer to is the techniques used to identify a photo or a moving face in a reel of film. The algorithms target spacial differences and anomalies along your  face:  how  far  the  chin  protrudes,  how  far  the  eyes  are  apart,  the biometrics of the ears and so forth. Does she have Asian features? Russian cheekbones and nose? Indonesian lips? There are almost a hundred nodes along a human face for an algorithm to work with. That doesn't sound so bad .  Only the bad news is that it only takes 20 or so nodes relative to a man or woman's face to be identified. If a satellite can identify a person's brand   of shoe from low orbit, you can imagine how easy it would be to size up a person's face and match that with a database .  The  good  news  is  that  even  mathematical  algorithms  can  be  tricked. Take  Google  for  example.  Google  spends  billions  on  its  algorithms  and much less on its programmers, which coincidentally happen to be some of the best on Earth, yet it is often simple techniques blackhat marketers use to fool  the  engine  into  thinking  data  is  relevant  when  it  really  isn't.  A  false positive, to say. Google coders adapt the code. The blackhatters catch on. Word spreads around the hive mind and they adapt as well .  Look At Your Feet  A lex Kilpatrick is a facial-recognition expert and research leader at the TIS  Tactical Info Systems  in Texas. He did an interview for the BBC where he talked about simple ways to defeat these systems. One being: Look at your feet. This obscures your identity in ways the cameras can't account for. And yes, you guessed right if you said the homeless have the advantage here .  When I was a student at Loyola University in New Orleans, donating my plasma kept my belly full on a few hard months as I awaited the arrival of my student loan check. Lots of students did this. Selling plasma was like selling  gold  when  you  were  starving  and  I  could  think  of  a  lot  of  other bodily fluids that might prove embarrassing to sell .  Well as fate would have it, I had to bus it down to the plasma center once  when  my  car  engine  went  kaput.  Buses  in  New  Orleans  were something I absolutely dreaded . I had to walk a block or so down Canal Street, aka Bum Central. It was an educational walk .  But  it  was  no  short  walk.  And  I  recall  bringing  my  psychology  book along on the RTA route to kill time. I'd occasionally look up, grinning at how in sync the bums and winos walks would be: Jazzy yet almost in tune with each other .  You've  seen  it  no  doubt...  Head  down  over  a  long  beard,  shotglass  of bourbon and swaggering. I came to admire them for their stealthy way of blending  into  the  trashy  panoramic  atmosphere.  The  entire  street  had several  theaters  back  then  and  I'd  see  them  hawk  and  hork  and  spit  and   panhandle  and  all  the  while  barely  raising  their  eyes  to  speak  to  honest Johns. Some of them even wore sunglasses .  S unglasses Don't Work  Perhaps a few bums wanted to be trendy bums. But the problem with wearing shades in order to fool surveillance cams is that the algorithm will simply ignore that section of your face and focus more intensely on other parts of it. In fact I'd say judging from the research done by the Chinese on facial recognition systems, it doesn't matter how big the glasses are, either .  O bnoxious Clothing DOES Work  If you've got a few articles of clothing with pictures of other people's faces  on  it,  that  will  disrupt  the  algorithm  in  the  same  way  billboards disrupt  Google  Earth's  Street  View  algorithm  that  tries  to  smear  real people's faces on the street for privacy .  Clothing like this :   Or this :  You don't necessarily need to go with a "face shirt" either, but the image  below is probably a stretch for society to accept :  Helmets Speaking of what society tolerates and what it doesn't, a beard and hat disguise is probably better than wearing a helmet for too long. A friend of mine remarked that he wears a full-face helmet whenever he rides a Ninja.   Keeps the bugs out of his hair, he says, but when he tries to pump gasoline while wearing it, the gas attendant won't turn on the pumps until he takes it off .  Well, no wet-behind-the-ears teenager is going to tell him what to do, so off he goes to another gas station. An Exxon this time. The end result: Same thing.  He  found  out  that  the  owners  of  these  gas  stations  like  to  have  a biker's  face  on  the  camera  in  case  the  police  come  by  asking  about  a kidnapped little girl .  I R LEDs  Remember  that  what  facial  recognition  systems  zero-in  on  is  relative triangles , such as the tip of your nose to the bottom of your chin and over to  your  ears,  or  from  your  chin  to  your  forehead  and  over  to  your  eyes. You're  unique  in  this  way  just  as  your  fingerprints  are  unique.  No  two people are the same .  But  an  IR  LEDs  will  disrupt  this  greatly.  We  discussed  laser  pointers disrupting instruments on jets. Well the same principle applies here, and I predict  this  will  find  its  way  into  our  clothing  styles  in  the  coming  years whether we like it or not, depending on how invasive Big Brother's systems become in the next decade .  The downside is that it doesn't work unless everyone is doing it since by using this you will clearly stand out on a monitor. Some celebrities used to wear use these to discourage the paparazzi whenever they'd come sniffing. It was set off by a camera flash and the results were not quite what they'd hoped .  Then  again,  the  antivirus  company  AVG is  reportedly  working  on  so- called  "invisibility  glasses"  that  thwart  facial  software  altogether.  It  uses LEDs  that  move  around  the  eyes  and  nose  which  distort  any  images  the system takes for the purpose of recognizing you .   Unfortunately it's only in the beginning stages at this point, but I believe  this is only the tip of the iceberg. Can Frodo's elvish cloak be far behind ?  C ollege Dorms  These are the absolute worst for privacy. At Loyola University during my junior year, I as well as every other resident of the Cabra Hall residence had to show our IDs every single time we entered to the desk attendant. It didn't matter if we'd spoken to said attendant a thousand times that day or  heaven forbid  we were related to her. Neither did it matter if we swiped the card without an error .  Nope. Every single time we walked through the front double-steel doors  to that fortress of doom, we got the "Papers please!" spiel .  Only one time the grad student behind the dusty counter caught me on a bad  day  after  a  hard  rain  and  a  failed  calculus  test,  and  I  refused.  For  a nanosecond I even considered flipping her off. But no, that'd too rude even for me as well as granting her that power of attention she craved. So I just walked right by her as though I'd swallowed an invisibility potion .  She didn't like that, and the next time I came around at dinnertime about 7  o'clock,  she  lashed  out  at  me  with  a  few  insults  she'd  brewed  in  my absence. Not only that, her face changed right before my eyes, going from conservative  librarian  girl  with  glasses  and  cinnamon  latte  to  a  gorgon's daughter looking for fresh meat .  That was it. I got pretty steamed myself and so I frisbeed the ID at her like that feral kid with the boomerang in Road Warrior - so fast I thought it'd put her eye out. It struck her forehead dead center before flipping away, over her desk and down her arm and into her bookbag. Next thing I knew I'm in the resident manager's office justifying my terrorist-like actions. But   more shocking than this was that he had my midterm grades on a Matrix- green computer screen in front of him .  I didn't enjoy sitting it out a semester .   CHARTING A NEW COURSE  I t could be that you want to disappear for non-criminal reasons. You don't have any debt. You simply want to get away to start a new chapter in life. Wipe the soul-draining high school slate clean and build anew. Become a French artist. Maybe a trainer of wind surfers in Bora Bora, watching fire dancers twirl flame every night as the sun sinks down while three filipinas you've never met are eying you up and down from the water .  M aybe you want to be a boat tour guide in the Philippines that brings all the newly minted expats out to see the whale feedings while exotic filipinas coo over your white skin  I saw with my own eyes how obsessed filipinas are  with  with  this  -  entire  aisles  in  pharmacies  filled  with  skin-whitening products .    Memories often make the man, but if you get rid of the things, that is, the  settings,  the  people,  the  jobs,  the  polluted  air,  that  miserable  dragon- breathing boss named Winona who works in HR, well you just have no idea what gifts await you on the other side. Just do it .  It's not the things we did in life that we regret on our death beds, but the things we never took up. Those procrastinations that we kept waving back into the horizon, over and over, never taking action. Forever leaving it to some other guy to step out of the safe zone .  When  I  lived  in  a  small  town  in  Louisiana  many  years  ago,  I  kept running  into  old  girlfriends.  Old  high  school  chums.  Old  sluts.  Old memories that dragged me down like the girl I'd never asked out who was now the woman in the red dress, a wall survivor now hitched to the mayor . Life's little moments like these made a habit of creeping up on me like a flow  of  lava  does  a  small  sleepy  town  in  Hawaii.  Moments  that  I  never thought I'd be reminded of day in, day out, slowly devouring me like lava embers do straw huts. Slow at first, warm before the embrace, but when the hit, well. They melt any sense of adventure .  So I made a break for a clean slate. First to Canada, then to SE Asia . Don't just dream about the clean slate. Take action. Meditating on your dreams,  as  I've  discovered,  can  actually  prevent  them  from  becoming reality.  It's  suboptimal  to  meditate  on  the  end  results  -  You  sipping margaritas in Bora Bora. That only works if you meditate on taking active steps towards making the dream happen in the first place. So don't meditate on the end-result...You must visualize yourself working toward the dream , mixing the reagents that, when all is said and done, is powerful enough to give you wings .  Are you a writer? Visualize yourself writing at the keyboard, banging out  five  thrilling  novels  per  year,  or  making  six  figures  by  building  an insanely good client base as a copywriter .   AFTERWORD  A tough question I repeatedly asked myself when I was overseas was this: Am I still the same person in Dumaguete that I was in New Orleans? What about Toronto, Canada ?  I mean I acted the same, very laid back and easy to approach, almost too easy now that I think about it. I ate the same - a good Mexican restaurant with cheese enchiladas and salsa with a side of guacamole with Blue Bell Homemade  Vanilla  ice  cream  for  dessert.  I  even  smelled  the  same  - Midnight and Noir cologne since the day they arrived .  Though no Mardi Gras or beignets were anywhere to be found in the Phils, I still believed in the same God. I'd not really disappeared so much as just  teleported,  I  feared,  just  as  Nightcrawler  did  in  so  many  comics, escaping doom .  Truly becoming invisible, I found, involved throwing out old grudges, grudges that rot the spirit and the mind. Grudges, I later found, that not only cause ulcers but rot any sense of risk or adventure. We're explorers and we don't  like  being  anchored  too  far  from  shore  without  a  rowboat.  We  like safety. We like security. But sometimes you must throw caution to the wind and  swim  for  it  completely  naked...  yes,  even  with  sharks  lurking  about. And it is this unknown  How many sharks? What kind? Meat-o-sauruses?  that keeps so many would-be explorers at bay .  The  key  to  overcoming  your  fear  is  courage.  Well,  that  and  a  little  imagination .  Envision yourself as someone else, say, a storyteller like Bilbo Baggins, tired of the retched relatives squawking like harpies over who gets what if he croaks one midsummer night. Bilbo the wanderer. Bilbo the explorer .   You have sufficient gold to navigate every hillside, every culture, every dragon's den. You can visit South Korea and meet the most beautiful people on Earth and all with a clean slate since no one knows of your mistakes. Where every moment is now, where you are invisible, yet visible. Tokyo, Thailand, Philippines, it's all yours for the taking. Your new face will go a long way in those parts of the world .  So go and take action to make it real !
