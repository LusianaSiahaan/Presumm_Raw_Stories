Introduction t I t I  n n  r r  o o  d d  u u  c c  t t  i i  o o  n n  Memory Escapes the State  Memory has gone rogue. What I mean by this, first of all, is that memory  has fallen into the hands of rogues.  From the late nineteenth through the late twentieth century, memory— not  private,  individual  memory,  but  public,  collective  memory—was  the  domain of the state. Writes Tony Bennett in The Birth of the Museum, “Muse- ums, galleries, and, more intermittently, exhibitions played a pivotal role in  the formation of the modern state and are fundamental to its conception  as, among other things, a set of educative and civilizing agencies.” Bennett  points out that “all developed nation-states” have consistently prioritized  funding for their memory institutions, and have benefited from these insti- tutions serving as “mechanisms for the permanent display of power,” and  as “influential cultural technologies” that testify to the states’ “ability to  command, order, and control objects and bodies, living or dead”  Bennett  1995, 66 . Achille Mbembe argues that “the term ‘archives’” is first of all  understood as referring to “a public institution, which is one of the organs  of a constituted state. … There is no state without archives”  Mbembe 2002,  19, 23 .1  But  when  digital  networked  media  began  displacing  earlier  forms  of  transmission   television,  radio,  cinema,  print   as  what  Philip  Auslander  calls “the cultural dominant”  Auslander 2008, 23  in regions with wide- spread Internet access, the ties binding public memory to the state began to  loosen, and memory started to forge links with many other masters: people  who never underwent training in library and information sciences  LIS  but  designated  themselves  “archivists”  anyway,  built  freely  accessible  online  archives, and began uploading  or assisting users with uploading  whatever  content  they  deemed  suitable  for  digital  preservation.  Digital  archiving,  while  of  increasing  interest  to  traditional  memory  institutions,  has  been    2   Introduction  most  enthusiastically  embraced  by  nonprofessionals—by  amateurs,  fans,  hackers, pirates, and volunteers—in other words, by “rogue” memory work- ers. Digital archives of cultural content, not associated with any physical  museum, library, or archive, populate the Internet, to the point that many  people refer to the Internet as a giant archive.  For example, Lev Manovich  states in The Language of New Media, “The Internet … can be thought of as  one huge distributed media database” [Manovich 2001, 55].   Rogue archivists explore the potential of digital technologies to democ- ratize  cultural  memory.  With  digital  tools  and  networks,  they  construct  repositories that are accessible by all Internet users, and can choose to pre- serve  either  vast  quantities  of  information   they  do  not  have  to  choose  to  save  some  types  of  content  and  discard  other  types  because  of  physi- cal space restrictions  or highly specific materials  such as the documents  of  subcultures  or  minority  groups   that  have  been  consistently  excluded  or ignored by traditional memory institutions. In Rogues, Jacques Derrida  relates the “roué” or “rogue,” the figure of licentiousness and debauchery  in French culture since the eighteenth century, to democracy: “Democracy,  the  passage  to  democracy,  democratization,  will  have  always  been  associ- ated  with  license,  with  taking  too  many  liberties,  with  the  dissoluteness  of the libertine, with liberalism, indeed perversion and delinquency, with  malfeasance, with failing to live according to the law, with the notion that  ‘everything is allowed,’ that ‘anything goes’”  Derrida 2005, 21 . In other  words,  the  process  of  ending  monarchy  and  inaugurating  democracy  in  France depended on rogues willing to “take liberties” with the very notion  of liberty and make themselves over from king’s subjects into republican  citizens. Similarly, since the late-1980s advent of what we might call the  public  Internet   that  is,  the  time  when  the  Internet  ceased  to  be  a  net- work usable only by government, university, and research lab employees,  and became a network with which millions of people engaged on a daily  basis ,2 rogue archivists have acted on the assumption that “anything goes”  on the network, taking the initiative to design, found, and run their own  cultural memory institutions without waiting for traditional institutions to  set any precedents for online archiving, and achieving a degree of demo- cratic inclusion and access for which brick-and-mortar archives never even  aimed. What I call rogue archives are defined by: constant  24 7  availability;  zero barriers to entry for all who can connect to the Internet; content that  can be streamed or downloaded in full, with no required payment, and no  regard for copyright restrictions  some rogue archivists digitize only what is  already in the public domain ; and content that has never been, and would  likely never be, contained in a traditional memory institution.   Introduction   3  One  digital  archivist  interviewed  by  my  research  team,  who  uses  the  pseudonym “jinjurly” and runs what is called the Audiofic Archive, sums  up the rogue’s attitude toward traditional ideas about the institutional qual- ifications required for archival work:  [I used to say] “I’ve got an archive, but I’m not an archivist.” I don’t have an archi- vist degree. But what does that mean? Okay, when I was cooking in restaurants, I  was writing menus and composing recipes and running a line and hiring and firing  and running a kitchen, but I wasn’t a chef, because I don’t have a chef education or  whatever. But again, what does that mean? I really, honestly think that—well, okay,  everything takes practice—but anyone can do these things.  jinjurly 2012   jinjurly’s words may have been scandalous in an earlier era, but as digital  culture  develops,  her  idea  that  “anyone  can  do  these  things”—meaning  that anyone can build a digital archive if she cultivates the necessary tech- nical skills, dedicates sufficient time and resources, and commits to serv- ing a public over a long time period of time through an enduring online  resource—is  becoming  more  and  more  common.  Indeed,  the  “scandal”  caused by rogue archivists consists precisely of their transforming “archives”  and “archiving” from terms that signify exclusivity into terms that signify  commonness,  so  that  instead  of  locked  rooms,  the  word  “archives”  con- notes websites that operate as information commons, and instead of the  concealed workings of a rarified circle of experts, “archiving” refers to acts  of database design and maintenance that “anyone can do,” that are com- monplace. And scandals such as these, caused by roués, Derrida claims, can  beget serious social and cultural transformations.  Derrida emphasizes rogues’ abilities to bring about change, even on the  scale of sweeping, radical revolutions. The rogues of digital archiving have  effectuated  cultural  memory’s  escape  from  the  state;  memory  will  never  again  be  wholly,  or  even  mostly,  under  the  control  of  the  state  or  state- approved capitalists. Having fallen under the sway of rogues, cultural mem- ory has become more democratic. But this is not the only way that memory  is different in the digital era than it was before.  Memory and Making  Memory has gone rogue in another sense: where it used to mean the record  of cultural production, memory is now the basis of a great deal of cultural  production. Digital technologies facilitate what Lawrence Lessig  2008  and  many others call “remix culture,” that is, the appropriation and transfor- mation of mass media texts  including films, television episodes, recorded    4   Introduction  music,  video  games,  comic  books,  novels,  and  so  on   into  alternate  ver- sions,  with  traces  of  the  “source”  texts  lingering  in  the  new  “takes,”  the  remixes. The people formerly known as the “audience” or as “consumers,”  whom many media scholars conceived of as passive recipients of popular  culture, have shown themselves to be quite active users of culture instead.  Media users have seized hold of all of mass culture as an archive, an enor- mous  repository  of  narratives,  characters,  worlds,  images,  graphics,  and  sounds from which they can extract the raw matter they need for their own  creations, their alternatives to or customizations of the sources.  Cultural memory has thus gone rogue with respect to its own tempo- rality, its own place in the order and timing of things. Engagement with  cultural memory is therefore not only what comes after the making and  distribution  of  cultural  texts,  it  also  now  often  precedes  that  making,  or  occurs  at  every  step  throughout  the  process  of  making.  So  many  digital  works begin as acts of memory, with a user remembering a loved  or hated   mass culture text and isolating, then manipulating, revising, and reworking,  specific elements of that text. In the past, the chain of media production  appeared to conclude with the culture industries’ distribution of a finished  product. At present, each media commodity becomes, at the instant of its  release, an archive to be plundered, an original to be memorized, copied,  and manipulated—a starting point or springboard for receivers’ creativity,  rather than an end unto itself.  And it is not only audiences who generate  these extensions of the source text; the culture industries are now deeply  committed  to  building  franchises  and  transmediations  around  their  suc- cessful  properties,  constantly  seeking  to  multiply  one  hit  concept  into  a  series  of  interlinked  films,  video  games,  television  series,  comics,  “webi- sodes,” and toys [see Jonathan Gray’s  2010  rich analysis of mass media’s  “paratexts”].   Memory has gone rogue in the sense that it has come loose from its fixed  place in the production cycle. It now may be found anywhere, or every- where, in the chain of making. And of course, it still may also be found in  its typical place, at the tail of the chain, as media users seek to archive their  remixes. Many “rogue” digital archives have, as their primary mission, the  collection and storage of users’ versions, digitizations, and transmediations  of media texts. Much of digital culture emerges through iterative, serial, and  distributed modes of production. Traditional memory institutions were not  designed to safeguard cultural texts that proliferate indefinitely. Numerous  untraditional digital archives, however, have been designed specifically for  this purpose.   Introduction   5  Memory as the “Cultural Dominant”  Memory has always been intrinsic to making, of course, but the relation  between  the  two  has  increasingly  come  to  the  forefront  of  popular  con- sciousness since the late 1970s, with the beginnings of postmodern appro- priation  in  visual  art,  architecture,  cinema,  hip  hop,  and  other  creative  genres. Today, in the third decade of the public Internet, digital culture can- not be thought separately from memory-based making, so prominently do  postmodern makers’ techniques  influenced by earlier movements, includ- ing Dada, surrealism, and situationism , such as collage, bricolage, intertex- tuality, détournement, culture jamming, and nostalgic reference, feature in  digital creativity. In fact, both postmodernism and new media have been  declared the post-print, post-television “cultural dominant” over the past  thirty years, and I argue that the contemporary preeminence, if we can call  it that, of both phenomena must be understood as not only simultaneously  occurring but also inextricably intertwined.  In 1984, Frederic Jameson declared postmodernism to be the “cultural  dominant” of the late twentieth century  Jameson 1984, 55–58 , based on a  style of production that he perceived to be transpiring in multiple spheres  of activity. But scholars who have taken up the term “cultural dominant”  from  Jameson  have  used  it  to  refer  to  a  specific  technological  medium  rather than to a style or mode of making. For example, in Liveness, perfor- mance scholar Philip Auslander writes, “I consider television, not film, to  be the dominant cultural medium of the second half of the twentieth cen- tury”  Auslander 2008, 11 , and states that the “televisual” is “the cultural  dominant”  23 . And in “What Is the Post-cinematic?” film scholar Steven  Shaviro  2011  periodizes the starting point of the “post-cinematic” to the  early twenty-first century, when film “has been ‘surpassed’ by digital and  computer-based media.”  Shaviro notes that he places “surpassed” in quo- tation marks “to guard against giving this term a teleological meaning”— and yet, there is a progression of media formats as “cultural dominants”  from film to television to digital, if we follow the development of the term  from Auslander to Shaviro.   Digital media is currently the cultural dominant in the sense that Aus- lander and Shaviro mean, marking one media form as ascendant over all  others.  But  let  us  also  retain  the  meanings  that  Jameson  assigned  to  the  term when he coined it, which have to do with how we make culture, and  what we do with culture. Jameson was prescient in naming postmodern- ism “the cultural dominant,” as digital culture is rife with the postmodern  moves of referentiality, citation, and appropriation that Jameson discusses.    6   Introduction  Contemporary media users do with cultural texts whatever they like, dis- regarding print and analog’s boundaries of textual cohesion  where a text  begins and ends , authorial ownership  who made the text , or historical  time  when a text was created , and this postmodern style of making has  proliferated  wildly  as  digital  media  has  facilitated  the  operations  of  cut- ting, copying, mixing, and distributing far better than previous media have  done.  By  this  reasoning,  the  cultural  dominant  of  the  early  twenty-first  century is postmodern digital media production.  Another way to say this is: memory-based making—facilitated by digital  tools, published on digital networks, and saved mostly in “rogue” digital  archives—is the cultural dominant of the early twenty-first century.  The Rise of Repertoire  “Archive”  in  this  book  has  multiple  valences.  I  am  writing  about  actual  digital archives, websites you can visit, such as the Internet Archive, ibiblio,  Project Gutenberg, and Open Library. I am also writing about metaphori- cal archives, archives that are opened up by each media text put into cir- culation,  archives  that  audience  members  enter  into,  plunder  for  usable  material,  and  then  augment  and  expand  when  they  deposit  their  trans- formations and variations back into the archive of the source.3 The actual  archives  and  the  metaphorical  archives  are  not  identical,  but  they  bear  close relation to one another; the actual digital networked archives serve  as the distribution and preservation mechanisms of the archival, or what I  call “archontic,” productions of media users. The dual notion of “archive,”  then, as constructed site conceptual entity, is this book’s central object of  investigation.  But  something  strange  happens  when  one  investigates  both  the  built  and metaphorical instances of “archive” in the digital age. The closer one  comes to “archive,” the more scrutiny one devotes to it, the larger another,  seemingly opposite, idea looms: the idea of “repertoire.” The reader who  begins  this  book  thinking  that  she  will  learn  all  about  “archive”  in  the  digital  era  will  finish  the  book  realizing  that  she  has,  in  fact,  been  read- ing intensively about “repertoire.” For every actual and virtual archive in  the digital age depends heavily on repertoire, and can even be said to rely  more on repertoire—by which I mean physical, bodily acts of repetition, of  human performance—than seems readily apparent.  Here is how repertoire works in actual archives: The scores of nonprofes- sional archivists who found and maintain online archives must labor end- lessly to keep their archives operational, and I mean “endlessly” literally, for    Introduction   7  whenever they stop investing their labor, their sites stagnate and or shut  down. Their archival labor consists of a repertoire, a series of actions that  they must perform over and over, which consists of moves such as paying  for  server  space,  processing  submissions   even  if  an  archive  has  an  auto- mated intake process, in which contributors can upload their own content  without  an  archivist’s  assistance,  the  archivist  must  still  constantly  over- see, debug, and improve the automated system , responding to users’ ques- tions, migrating the data when necessary, and representing the archive to  interested members of the public or press. The very fragility of digital data  and Internet sites, the fact that digital content is so prone to disappearance  and loss, means that no Internet archive should be regarded as a structure  that will last into perpetuity. Most, if not all, digital archives that currently  exist will not survive into the next century. But I predict that the methods  and  means  that  rogue  archivists  have  developed  for  assembling,  coding,  and operating idiosyncratic archives will survive. In other words, the reper- toire of digital archive building that has been pioneered over the past few  decades will likely outlast any actual archives that have been built.  Here  is  how  repertoire  works  in  metaphorical  archives:  The  action  of  treating media texts as archives has always been implicit or ignored in print  culture but explicit and universally acknowledged in performance cultures.  Humans are playback machines  Gaines 1991  that record what they see,  hear, and otherwise experience sensorially, and then play back those experi- ences, transforming them in the process. A music fan sings a popular song  in the shower, putting his personal “take” on it; a professional DJ creates  an extended mix of a hit recording by mashing it up with samples lifted  from twelve other tracks. A child pretends to be a superhero or a monster  after  seeing  a  slew  of  genre  films;  a  theater  company  mounts  the  thou- sandth production of a classic musical. All of these reperformers have put  the  source  text  into  their  repertoires.  They  play  back,  with  a  difference,  what they have stored in their memories. Digital makers who appropriate  literary  works,  still  and  moving  images,  video  games,  and  other  cultural  productions in recorded or “archival” formats, do the same: they add the  texts  they  experience  to  their  repertoires,  and,  using  their  bodies   at  the  least,  their  fingers  and  wrists  interfacing  with  computer  keyboards,  their  eyes and ears gauging their inputs and outputs , they reperform what they  have stored.  Therefore, I understand the increasing popularity of postmodern digital  remix, of memory-based making, of what I call archontic production, as an  elevation of the logics and methods of performance, and as a sharp spike in  the cultural significance of repertoire. Yet another way in which memory    8   Introduction  in the digital age has gone rogue is in its dramatically shifting the balance  of power between archive and repertoire. Where print culture consistently  privileged the memory mode of archive over repertoire, digital culture does  not  sustain  this  privilege.  At  present,  repertoire  may  not  currently  carry  greater importance than archive as a modality of memory, but repertoire is  certainly on the rise as digital culture evolves.  Above, I stated that memory-based digital making is the cultural domi- nant. I will now elaborate on that statement: memory-based digital making  manifests  in  both  actual  and  virtual  archives,  through  the  modalities  of  both  archive  and  repertoire.  For  repertoire  factors  heavily  into  built  and  metaphorical archives. Repertoire is a key driver of both categories of digital  archive.  Archive and Repertoire  In  my  discussion  of  archive  and  repertoire,  I  am  referencing  Diana  Tay- lor’s  theoretical  explorations  of  the  two  concepts  in  her  landmark  work  of  performance  studies,  The  Archive  and  the  Repertoire   2003 ,  and  subse- quently in her essay “Save As …: Knowledge and Transmission in the Age  of  Digital  Technologies”   2010 .  In  The  Archive  and  the  Repertoire,  Taylor  argues that print culture’s hierarchy of memory logics ranks archive over  repertoire. Print-analog culture valorizes “‘archival’ memory,” which, Tay- lor states, “exists as documents, maps, literary texts, letters, archeological  remains, bones, videos, films, CDs, all those items supposedly resistant to  change”  Taylor 2003, 19 , and denigrates repertoire, which Taylor defines  as “embodied memory: performances, gestures, orality, movement, dance,  singing—in short, all those acts usually thought of as ephemeral, nonre- producible knowledge”  20 . Although Taylor points out that while archive  and  repertoire  often  “work  in  tandem”   21    she  gives  the  example  of  ceremonies  such  as  flag-planting  complementing  the  writing  of  histories  of  colonial  conquest ,  the  Global  North’s  “tendency  has  been  to  banish  the repertoire to the past”  21  and to characterize repertoire, as historian  Jacques Le Goff does, as “ethnic memory”  21 , and as “traditional, authen- tic, now lost,” as opposed to archival memory, which is “present,” “mod- ern,” and “global”  22 .  Often, Taylor argues, a binary is drawn between archive as “mediated”  and repertoire as “unmediated”  22 . But she resists these definitions, and  flags the ascent of digital media as a moment that will push against print- analog culture’s opposition of archive to repertoire: “Other systems of trans- mission—like the digital—complicate any simple binary formulation”  22 .    Introduction   9  Taylor’s essay “Save As …” delves deeper into the question of what the digi- tal might do to alter the long-entrenched “embodied documented divide”:  “If the repertoire consists of embodied acts of transfer and the archive pre- serves and safeguards print and material culture—objects—what to make  of the digital that displaces both bodies and objects as it transmits more  information far faster and more broadly than ever before?”  Taylor 2010, 3 . Taylor  questions  whether  print  culture’s  hierarchy  of  memory  modes  will persist through the transition of media regimes. I argue that not only  are we witnessing the rise of repertoire in actual archive building and in  the archontic productions of media users, we are seeing repertoire assert its  significance, even its primacy, in multiple other arenas of memory-based  making in digital culture. For example, as I will argue in chapter 6, users  perform bodily in digital networks, not only when they record their physi- cal bodies acting or singing and circulate their recordings online but when  they determine  in text, icons, screen grabs, GIFs, game play, animations,  or art  the actions of avatars  which represent themselves  and what I call  “marionettes”   which  represent  fictional  characters —these  are  instances  of repertoire.  But  the  history  of  digital  culture  also  still  shows  moments  of  strong  division between repertoire and archive. For example, in chapter 5, I will  describe the anxiety of a female subculture as it faced mass migration from  physical meeting spaces to online virtual spaces. I perceive the subculture’s  early mistrust of the Internet as a fear that their cultural memory, which  had been encoded largely as repertoire  embodied transmissions from expe- rienced members to newcomers , or as repertoire combined with printed  “zines,” would not survive a mass migration into the text-only sphere of  the Internet.  This book, then, investigates a range of ways that digital media are dras- tically altering long-standing definitions of cultural memory. I am studying  how cultural memory has become a question mark, how it has become an  unfixed and dynamic concept, how it has gone rogue. The expansion of the  meanings of “archive,” the growing prominence of “repertoire,” and the  constantly shifting relation between the two memory modes are key topics  in every chapter.  The Promise of Democratization  I study rogue memory in large part because of the promise of democratiza- tion that inheres in it. Earlier, I cited Derrida’s proposition that large-scale  change depends on rogues, and that democracy itself emerged in modern    10   Introduction  Europe as a result of the liberties taken by rogues. In the upending of old  assumptions  about  what  cultural  memory  is  and  how  it  works  by  rogue  archivists and rogue media users, I see a number of exciting political pos- sibilities, including:     The possibility for vast quantities of cultural content to be preserved and  made accessible to a broad public—marking an end, in certain spaces, to  what  Raymond  Williams   [1961]  2001,  66–69   calls  “the  selective  tradi- tion,” which always grants priority to the culture that supports the narra- tives and identities of the dominant group.    The possibility for subcultural and marginalized groups to have archives  of their own, on digital networks, constructed and operated by members of  their communities, instead of  or in addition to  lobbying traditional mem- ory institutions for recognition and admission of their cultural materials.    The possibility for “mass audiences” to invert the sociocultural hierarchy  that  places  them  at  the  bottom  of  the  power  structure  of  media,  and  to  exhibit, en masse, their ability to treat the culture industries’ products as the  incomplete, often impoverished, basic matter from which they construct  meaningful texts for themselves and their affinity-based communities.    The possibility for a style of memory-based making in the mode of reper- toire—that is, an everyday making, an individualized and personalized style  of reperformance, a holding-in-common of all culture as shared resource  and property—to challenge the barriers of copyright and antiduplication  technologies erected around archival genres such as printed text and image,  sound, and video recordings.  Rogue cultural memory is not essentially the product or tool of margin- alized and minority groups; it may certainly be used to serve the interests  of dominant classes and groups. But, over the past few decades, it has been  effectively  developed  and  deployed  to  strengthen  the  positions  and  fuel  the activities of subordinated individuals and collectives, and to further the  projects of democratization outlined above. This book will document some  of the ways in which digital technologies and networks, and the memory- based  making  they  enable,  have  subverted  and  counteracted  traditional  power structures. I have stated that memory has fallen into the hands of  rogues, and what this explicitly means is: memory has fallen into female  hands, into queer hands, into immigrant and diasporic and transnational  hands, into nonwhite hands, into the hands of the masses.  Factors of identity, wealth, and geographic location continue to facilitate  the “digital divide,”4 and I do not claim that the spread of digital archiving  is  closing  gaps  in  computing  access  or  skill  between  large  numbers  of    Introduction   11  people. The focus of this book is on how people who are usually marginal- ized in narratives of technological development are innovating new media  practices  in  ways  that  will  likely  alter  how  cultural  memory  takes  form,  becomes institutionalized, and operates going forward. Sarah Florini states,  “Digital media studies often erase users of color. … When users of color do  receive scholarly attention, most often they are cast as victims with limited  technological access and resources. The consistent scholarly focus on the  ‘digital divide’ all too often frames people of color as technological outsid- ers and has served to obscure the many people of color who are online”   Florini  2014,  224 .  Like  Florini,  I  aim  to  fill  in  some  of  the  blanks  that  persist  in  new  media  studies  around  the  activity  of  nonwhite,  nonmale,  nonheteronormative individuals and collectives on digital networks. As a  woman of color from the Global South, and as an ally of queer people and  politics, I have a vested interest in increasing the representation of these  groups in new media scholarship. I have therefore selected, as my primary  case study, a set of online communities that are predominantly female and  largely queer.  The Case of Fan Fiction Archives  Though this book will make reference to, and offer descriptions of, many  digital archives as examples of rogue memory, my chief example through- out  will  be  Internet  fan  fiction  archives.  Cultural  memory  in  the  digital  era—or digital cultural memory—can be imagined as a double helix struc- ture, like DNA: one strand consists of memory-based making in the form  of appropriations, remixes, and transformative works, and the other strand  consists  of  actual  archives  that  exist  online  which  publish  and  preserve  a great deal of digital content, much of which is appropriative in nature.  Media fans provide an ideal case for investigating digital cultural memory  because they were early developers and practitioners of both online archive  building and archontic production. In Internet fan fiction communities, we  find a full expression of the double helix of digital cultural memory.  Media fan cultures populate the Internet and their creations run ram- pant  through  it;  hoards  of  appropriations  and  remixes,  transmediations  and  transformations,  macros  and  parody  vids  and  “Fuck  Yeah”  Tumblrs5  and other responses to mass media traverse digital networks. I argue that  Internet  fan  cultures  are  archival  cultures  in  multiple  ways:  their  core  operations  concern  the  apprehension  of  media  as  archive,  the  uncon- strained plundering of that archive, and the construction of both virtual  archives   the  overarching  archives  opened  by  media  texts—for  example,    12   Introduction  the “Cinderella archive” or the “Batman archive,” which fans continually  expand with their new variations and versions  and actual digital archives   websites on which fan archivists store their communities’ creative works .  I view fan cultures as exemplary of Internet culture at large, and the actions  of fan cultures as therefore illustrative of the shifting memory logics of the  digital  era:  in  online  fan  fiction  communities  and  archives,  the  binaries  and oppositions that print-analog culture established between archive and  repertoire fade and blend.  By  studying  online  fan  archives  and  archivists—a  group  of  users  that  began dedicating themselves to digital cultural memory work in the early  1990s, just as the Internet and the World Wide Web were becoming inte- gral to daily life for a broad user base in the United States—we can gain  insights  into  how  rogue  memory  has  operated  so  far:  what  digital  pres- ervation  has  required  in  the  way  of  technical  and  organizational  labor,  how  it  has  evolved  as  network  technologies  and  network  cultures  have  rapidly changed, and how appropriation and remix practices rely as much  on performance-oriented, embodied means of transmission as on archival  media. In other words, through analyzing Internet fan fiction archives, we  can  understand  the  circumstances,  motivations,  and  decisions  that  have  shaped rogue digital memory.  Gender, Sexuality, and Digital Archiving  Internet fan fiction archives are also valuable as objects of study because  they are archives of women’s digital culture and queer digital culture. Fan  fiction is created primarily by people and for people who self-identify as  female or as not-male, many of whom identify as nonheterosexual or not  exclusively heterosexual  I present qualitative and quantitative data on the  femaleness and queerness of fan fiction archive contributors and users in  chapter 3 . Women and queer individuals and collectives occupy minoritar- ian positions on and in digital networks, although they participate in these  networks heavily.  Despite the cyberutopian hopes of Norbert Wiener and other early pio- neers of computing culture, who saw in information systems “model[s] of  an egalitarian, democratic social order” and “metaphors for the democratic  creation of order from below”  Turner 2006, 24 , inequality persists in Inter- net use, and gender is no less a constant marker of disparity in the digital  sphere than other identity traits. “One of the most enduring technological  inequalities is the gender divide,” write Laura J. Dixon et al.  2014, 992 :  “Research has detailed a variety of ways in which women lag behind men    Introduction   13  in  the  ownership  of  technology  and  the  development  of  technological  skills.  For  example,  men  own  and  use  computers  and  the  Internet  more  than women, spend more time online, take more technology classes, and  show more motivation to learn digital skills”  992; see also Cooper 2006;  Correa 2010; Livingstone and Helsper 2007; Seiter 1999 . While “women  have a long history in computing,” according to Janet Abbate, whose Recod- ing Gender seeks to restore the work of generations of female programmers  to the historical record, “women today [in the United States and UK] hold  a relatively low percentage of computer science degrees and technical com- puting  jobs,  and  popular  stereotypes  of  male  computer  geeks  abound”   Abbate  2012,  2 .  Lisa  Parks  states,  “Despite  feminist  efforts  to  claim  the  computer as a platform for social transformation, the dominant social, eco- nomic, and cultural discourses continue to position computer technologies  as domains of masculine activity, authority, and control”  Parks 2004, 141 .  That millions of girls and women use the Internet daily does not obviate  the fact that, in the early decades of the twenty-first century, technocul- ture remains strongly gendered male, not only in the Global South  Intel  Corporation 2012 , but in the Global North as well. This gendering is evi- dent in the preponderance of men in technology sector jobs, particularly  in top positions  Forrest 2014; Linshi 2015; Williams 2014 , in the scarcity  of women inventors and coders in histories of hardware and software  as  Abbate points out , and in the commonality of harassment  including rape  threats and death threats  directed at women who, through their blogging  or  social  media  activity,  gain  large  followings  or  otherwise  attain  public  prominence  see Dockterman 2014; Hess 2014; Sierra 2014 .  Tech corporations may value women’s social media use and e-commerce  activity  Lee 2011 , and women may be more active participants on many  social networks than men  Duggan 2013; Duggan and Brenner 2013 , but  women do not exercise the majority of financial, managerial, and cultural  control over tech corporations, and they have not derived most of the prof- its, or power, generated by them over their recent period of explosive growth.  As I have argued elsewhere,6 women’s online activities, including fannish  participation on social networks, often constitute a type of free labor that  increases the value of the networks themselves, as well as of various prod- ucts—labor on which companies have come to rely for the generation and  maintenance of audience interest in, and the spread of “buzz” or “hype”  around,  their  commodities  and  platforms.  In  other  words,  while  women  may  gain  personal  pleasure  and  satisfaction  from  their  contributions  to  social networks, what they do online constitutes a form of production from  which capitalist enterprises extract significant amounts of economic value,    14   Introduction  and  for  which  those  enterprises  do  not  have  to  pay  wages.   Women  are  hardly alone in this respect—the vast majority of Internet users donate free  labor to tech companies when they use social media sites—but I wish to  emphasize that, even if women currently participate in social networks in  greater numbers than men, the economic and managerial structures of new  media corporations are not gender balanced.   The fact that women do not shape or direct the infrastructure or opera- tions of the majority of the Internet has had serious consequences for their  digital  cultural  productions:  female  fan  communities  have  experienced  large-scale  content  “takedowns,”  in  which  site  owners moderators  delete  fans’ work from websites without fans’ advance knowledge or permission   Fanlore, “Strikethrough and Boldthrough”; Supernatural Wiki 2011; Jardin  2007 , and attempts by Hollywood stakeholders to create rule-bound, mon- itored spaces—gated digital neighborhoods—for fan fiction online, and to  monetize the production of fan works  without making any provisions for  financially  compensating  fan  creators    Cupitt  2008;  Jenkins  2007a;  Fan- lore,  “FanLib” .  Corporate-owned  Internet  platforms,  either  because  they  fundamentally  misunderstood  the  purpose  and  significance  of  female- driven online fan communities, or because they have aimed to co-opt and  exploit women fans’ labor, thus have sought to actively curtail and suppress  women’s digital cultures, and have challenged their right to exist.  Other threats to women’s online expression have arisen in recent years,  and may rise again soon: millions of Internet users successfully protested  in  2012  against  the  Stop  Online  Piracy  Act   SOPA   and  the  PROTECT  IP  Act  PIPA , which the Electronic Frontier Foundation and many other orga- nizations  criticized  for  posing  dangers  to  freedom  of  online  expression  and access to information  Samuels and McSherry 2012 , but the US Con- gress only tabled these acts; it did not withdraw them from consideration  altogether.  Proposed  laws  such  as  these,  if  passed,  could  render  Internet  communities  primarily  populated  by  user-generated  content,  including  women’s fan communities, vulnerable to sudden and massive takedowns  or closures. Internet cultural creation—especially that which lies outside,  or deliberately confounds, the realm of normative, conventional, socially  acceptable  discourse—could  swiftly  be  “chilled”  if  users  felt  that  sharing  their creativity would subject their works, or themselves, to hostile surveil- lance or policing. Laws aside, if large-scale social networks such as YouTube,  Facebook, or Tumblr were to simply place greater restrictions on the types of  cultural expression they allow, the same chilling effect would occur. Female  fan expression, which is considered by many, as Henry Jenkins writes, to be  a “scandalous category” of cultural production, well outside the bounds of    Introduction   15  “‘good taste,’ appropriate conduct, or aesthetic merit”  Jenkins 1992, 16 ,  would be among the most likely categories of online expression to suffer  under increased Internet regulation—and unless users remain vigilant and  actively protect their rights, as they did in 2012 with respect to SOPA and  PIPA, such regulation may very well come to pass.  As  far  as  LGBTQ  participation  on  the  Internet,  online  targeting  and  shaming  of  self-identifying  queer  people,  especially  among  young  users,  is commonplace. A 2013 report by the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education  Network   GLSEN   states  that  LGBT  youth  “experience  nearly  three  times  as  much  bullying  and  harassment  online  as  non-LGBT  youth”   GLSEN  2013 , and several suicides of teens and college students have been linked  to the victims’ being cyberbullied because of their queer sexualities  New  York  Times  2012;  Huffington  Post  2012;  Pitts  2010 .  The  censorship  and  harassment of adult LGBTQ users online is also well documented  Cossman  2013; boyd 2006a . At the same time that the Internet offers LGBTQ youth  opportunities to “find greater peer support, access to health information  and opportunities to be civically engaged” than they typically can access  in “real life”  GLSEN 2013 , networked technologies often work to suppress  queer  expression  and  communication,  both  through  identifiable,  visible  modes such as harassment, and through far less detectable means, such as  deletion of content, or the prevention of content posting. As Brenda Coss- man writes, the Internet “is a site of censorship [of LGBTQ expression] that  is  not  well  understood;  much  of  it  [the  logic  governing  this  censorship]  remains  locked  in  confidential  algorithms,  allowing  what  we  do  see  and  do not see to remain in a kind of digital closet”  Cossman 2013, 46 . And  queer studies scholars have expressed concerns over tech firms’ exploitative  attitudes toward queer users that mirror my concerns over these corpora- tions’ reliance on the free labor of women users. Kate O’Riordan and David  J. Phillips state,  Through the 1990s, ownership and control of the infrastructure of the internet …  became increasingly the domain of fewer, larger, and more integrated media corpo- rations. [Joshua] Gamson has noted that this has entailed a “transformation of gay  and  lesbian  [Internet]  media  from  organizations  answering  at  least  partly  to  geo- graphical and political communities into businesses answering primarily to advertis- ers and investors.” … [John Edward] Campbell, too, has pursued the political and  cultural representations of this transformation, as “Janus-faced … online portals …  present  themselves  as  inclusive  communities  to  gay  and  lesbian  consumers  while  simultaneously  presenting  themselves  as  surveilling  entities  to  corporate  clients.”   O’Riordan and Phillips 2007, 5    16   Introduction  Countering  the  depriving,  threatening,  suppressing,  or  exploitative  attitudes and moves to which women and LGBTQ are frequently exposed  on  digital  networks,  Internet  fan  fiction  archives  serve  as  “safe  spaces”  for  the  production,  publication,  distribution,  access,  and  safeguarding  of  female and queer digital culture. bell hooks states that the second-wave US  women’s  movement  articulated  the  need  for  “‘safe’  spaces  where  groups  of presumably like-minded women [can] come together, sharing ideas and  experiences without fear of silencing”  hooks 1994, 76 ;7 LGBTQ and other  equality movements have since applied the concept of “safe spaces” to both  real-world and online collectives  New Tactics 2013; Ferguson 2014; Craig  2014 . Drawing on the discourse of safe space, fan studies scholars Alexis  Lothian, Kristina Busse, and Robin Anne Reid characterize Internet fan fic- tion communities as “queer female space”  Lothian, Busse, and Reid 2007 .8  Many fan fiction archivists have taken great care to construct and operate  their archives on servers and URLs that they own, to avoid any censorial  pressure or “TOS’ing”9 from corporate site owners; also, no fan archivists  charge fees for access to their sites, and most also refuse to permit advertis- ing on their archives  although some archives fundraise to cover the costs  of server space . Fan archives explicitly position themselves as friendly and  open to female and queer makers and users, especially for the making and  use of cultural texts that pertain to female and queer affect and sexuality.  These archives may be regarded as spaces of safety in that they stand apart  from corporate-owned sites, they commit to preserving women’s and queer  people’s content and to protecting that content from censorship  and the  content producers from harassment  as much as possible, and they do not  seek to transmute women and queer users’ voluntary digital labor into prof- its for majority male and straight owners.  Internet fan fiction archives also provide another function for women  and queer digital culture. Achille Mbembe states that archives confer sta- tus on their contents, and on the culture and society that produced those  contents: “The archive … is fundamentally a matter of discrimination and  of selection, which, in the end, results in the granting of a privileged status  to certain written documents, and the refusal of that same status to others,  thereby judged ‘unarchivable.’ The archive is, therefore, not a piece of data,  but a status”  2002, 20 . The status that the archive awards is, first of all,  according to Mbembe, the foundational status of existence, of a person or a  culture having existed: “The archive becomes … something that does away  with doubt, exerting a debilitating power over such doubt. It then acquires  the status of proof. It is proof that a life truly existed, that something actu- ally happened. … The final destination of the archive is therefore always    Introduction   17  situated … in the story that it makes possible”  20–21 . Fans, fan fiction,  and fan communities have historically been granted incredibly low status  in  cultural  hierarchies   Jenkins  1992,  9–23;  Coppa  2006b,  230–233 ,  and  online archives of fan works will not likely alter that ranking. But Mbembe  illuminates the power of digital communities’ self-made archives to award  those communities with the minimal status of having truly existed, of their  individual and collective cultures having actually happened, and therefore of  making possible their insertion into history. In the absence of archives of  their work, female and queer uses users of the Internet would risk disap- pearance and erasure; their cultures would remain unknown and unknow- able to subsequent generations, as the existence of so many women’s and  queer people’s cultural expressions in earlier eras have been excluded from  the historical record.  Fans who found and operate their communities’ digital archives do not  guarantee that they or their works will be remembered, but they create the  conditions of possibility for persistence and recollection. Perhaps the last  quarter-century  of  digital  fan  archiving  will  matter  to  no  one  a  quarter- century from now; but perhaps digital fan productions made between 1990  and  2015,  and  many  genres  of  user-generated  Internet  content  from  the  same time period, will be widely regarded as critically important forms of  early digital networked culture, just as silent films hold a venerable place  in cinema history and amateur ham radio operators are understood to be  the direct ancestors of the broadcasting industries. Maybe successive gen- erations of girls and women and LGBTQ people will benefit from the first  twenty-five years of fan archiving; maybe future historians will value the  ability to access evidence of what it was to be female and queer online in  the first wave of mass Internet use. Fan archivists cultivate this chance, this  may-be.  Fans’ archive building and archive maintenance constitute attempts to  prove to the future that particular queer and female ways of being and mak- ing existed. If fan archivists did not carefully assemble such proof, women  and queer fans’ digital collective actions would almost certainly be forgot- ten, go unlearned, or simply be, as Mbembe puts it, the subjects of doubt,  of disbelief that they ever were. In part this forgetting or doubt would result  from the ephemerality of digital production, against which all digital archi- vists must tirelessly work, but it would also arise from the tendency of hege- monic discourse to elide and ignore what it cannot incorporate.  What I have said here of women and queer fans can be said of every non-  and counterhegemonic group that forges a community online and seeks to  archive its communications and cultural expressions. Rogue archival efforts    18   Introduction  are political efforts, for, as Derrida argues, “There is no political power with- out control of the archive, if not of memory. Effective democratization can  always be measured by this essential criterion: the participation in and the  access to the archive, its constitution, and its interpretation”  Derrida 1995,  11 . Those on the edges of power, in real life and in virtual life, continu- ally invent new cultural forms and genres online, prolifically generate and  actively spread their digital productions, and establish digital archives, first  of all, in order to demonstrate that their cultures and their creations exist  and deserve the status and recognition of being, and second, to refuse those  at the center of power complete “control of the archive.” Rogue archivists  insistently  pry  open  “the  archive”—digital  cultural  memory  writ  large— to include their idiosyncratic repositories, and thus foist some measure of  democratization onto the field of contemporary archival practice.  Objects and Methods  I define rogue digital archives as Internet sites that can be accessed by all  online users, with no paywalls or institutional barriers; that allow all con- tent to be streamed or downloaded in full; that do not delete, hide, or edit  content  based  on  copyright  holders’  allegations  of  legal  infringement  or  for any other reason; that are committed to the persistent publication and  long-term  preservation  of  all  content  that  they  store;  that  have  search- and-retrieval features so that users can locate specific texts; and that have  either weak ties or no affiliations with traditional memory institutions such  as  government  archives,  university  libraries,  and  brick-and-mortar  muse- ums. There are many sites and platforms that are commonly referred to as  “archives” that do not meet these criteria, such as YouTube, Tumblr, and  Wikipedia.  YouTube frequently deletes user-uploaded content because of  copyright-related complaints; Tumblr is not searchable and has shown lit- tle interest in the long-term preservation of content published there; and  Wikipedia  allows  readers  to  view  summaries  of  many  texts,  but  not  the  texts in full.  I do not discuss in detail any of these sites.  My  examples  of  rogue  archives  include  the  Internet  Archive,  Project  Gutenberg, ibiblio, the Rhizome ArtBase, and many smaller, lesser-known  archives founded by specific subcultures, minority groups, and artists’ col- lectives. I discovered a great deal of information about these archives from  news articles and various texts written by their archivists that have been  published online.  However,  one  category  of  archives—fan  fiction  archives—serve  as  my  core  case  study  because,  as  stated  above,  fan  fiction  communities  have    Introduction   19  a  long  history  of  archive  building,  and  their  primary  modes  of  cultural  production are remixing and appropriation, making fans exemplary digi- tal memory workers at the level of content production as well as content  preservation. I gathered much more primary data about Internet fan fic- tion archives than about any other type of rogue archive. From June 2012  through March 2013, I directed an oral history project titled “Fan Fiction  and Internet Memory” or FFIM, funded by the UC Berkeley Committee on  Research and the Townsend Center for the Humanities. Undergraduate Lisa  Cronin, PhD candidate Andrea Horbinski, and I conducted 56 interviews  with 50 participants who had a history of activity in fan fiction archives,  as archive-builders and or maintainers, as authors, as dedicated readers and  reviewers, or as all of these. Participation was by invitation only, and we  extended  invitations  to  individuals  whom  we  knew  personally,  or  knew  of, from our own histories of online fan activity; we also welcomed sugges- tions from our interviewees of additional individuals that we should invite.  We were able to recruit participants who had been involved with Internet  fan archives from the early 1990s, when the first archives opened, through  the time of our interviews in 2012 and 2013. In other words, we succeeded  in gathering descriptions and recollections of every phase of Internet fan  fiction archives from the fans that we interviewed, with many interview- ees having actively participated in online fandom from its inception. All  interviews were conducted in English, and participants discussed primarily,  though not exclusively, Anglophone media and English-language fandoms.  We  cite  all  interviewees  by  their  chosen  names;  some  participants  chose  their legal names, and others chose pseudonyms  in Internet fandoms, the  use of pseudonyms is a common practice . The appendix contains detailed  information about the FFIM oral history project, including the demograph- ics of our participants in table form and as visualizations.  The temporal range covered in the personal histories shared by our FFIM  participants allows me to make some generalizations about how fans think  and feel about fan fiction archives. It would be a mistake for me, or any  researcher, to presume that fans are more similar than they are different;  the FFIM project reinforced what I already knew from my participation in  fan communities, which is that fans’ experiences of online fandom are, for  the most part, distinctive and unique, and a number of contentious issues  arise in online fandom on which every fan has her own personal opinion.  There are as many pathways through Internet fandom, as many attitudes  toward fandom, and as many intellectual frames for understanding the “fan  experience,” as there are individual fans. However, I was able to identify  several clusters of opinions, attitudes, and experiences from our interviews,    20   Introduction  and I have done my best to accurately represent our participants’ views in  the chapters that follow.  In addition to the oral history research team I assembled, I put together  a  different  but  related  team  of  digital  humanities  researchers,  for  a  proj- ect  called  “Fan  Data,”  funded  by  the  Hellman  Fellows  Fund  and  the  UC  Berkeley  Committee  on  Research,  and  supported  in  part  by  URAP   the  Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program at UC Berkeley . The Fan Data  team collaborated to build a series of “data scrapers”—Python scripts that  could be used to extract and analyze large sets of information from web- sites—to perform various quantitative analyses of a diverse range of Inter- net fan fiction archives. The conclusion includes numerous visualizations  and graphics that show the size and scale of these archives, as well as their  rates of production, growth over time, and  for some archives  the number  of authors, reviewers, and readers who have participated in them. Over the  years that I have worked on this project, I have repeatedly been asked for  numerical statistics about the phenomenon of Internet fan fiction. I specifi- cally designed the Fan Data project to quantify the “world” of fan fiction  archives, and am pleased to present our results here.  As for my theoretical methods: I have already begun to discuss Internet  archives using the language of performance, and I will continue to employ  performance-related  vocabulary  throughout  this  book.  At  UC  Berkeley,  I  am a scholar “housed” in two campus units: the Berkeley Center for New  Media  BCNM  and the Department of Theater, Dance & Performance Stud- ies  TDPS . Given that my two academic “homes” are new media studies  and performance studies, it should not be surprising that performance stud- ies is crucial to my thinking about new media, and vice versa. My analyses  will be suffused with terms and concepts borrowed from performance, even  though—or, I would say, because—I am examining new media objects. In  break 0, which follows this introduction, I offer the reader a genealogy of  the decades-long interrelation of performance studies and new media stud- ies;  I  intend  this  work  to  be  a  contribution  to  that  important,  if  largely  unknown, tradition of scholarship.  Chapters and Breaks  This  book  contains  two  types  of  sections:  “chapters”  and  “breaks.”  The  breaks and the chapters alternate, so following this Introduction, the reader  will encounter the somewhat clumsily numbered break 0, then chapter 1,  then break 1, then chapter 2, then break 2, and so on. I have written the  chapters  in  what  I  consider  to  be  a  straightforward  academic  style,  and    Introduction   21  have written the breaks somewhat differently. I would say that some of the  breaks  are  more  informal,  some  are  more  experimental,  and  the  rest  are  simply less rounded-out and more fragmentary than the chapters. I have  taken the term “breaks” from hip-hop culture; here is a definition from S.  Craig Watkins  2005 : “[Grandmaster] Flash and his DJ friends believed that  in every great record there is an even greater part, what they called ‘the get  down part.’ That part of the song is more formally referred to as the break”   27 . I would not claim that this book’s breaks are “greater” than its chap- ters, but I do think of the breaks as “the get down parts.” I generated them  more in the spirit of jamming or freestyling, while I crafted the chapters in  order to advance specific arguments.  I  have  explained  that  I  conceive  of  digital  cultural  memory  as  being  composed of both actual and metaphorical archives. Some of the chapters  and breaks therefore concentrate on digital archives located on the Inter- net, while other chapters and breaks investigate archives at a more concep- tual level. The idea of repertoire will be a consistent thread through all of  my varied approaches to different archival entities and genres; I will make  the case that many forms of repertoire penetrate, suffuse, and define many  archival practices.  Break 0, “A Glossary of Key Terms,” will serve to define several concepts  that I have only alluded to in this introduction: digital cultural memory,  archontic  production,  the  connection  of  new  media  studies  and  perfor- mance studies, fan fiction, and fan fiction archives. This break aims to help  the reader gain an understanding of what I mean by each of these terms,  and why I think them important, which will help the reader as she pro- gresses through the subsequent sections and repeatedly encounters these  key concepts.  Chapter 1, “Memory Machine Myth: The Memex, Media Archaeology,  and Repertoires of Archiving” strives to dispel the widespread perception  that  the  Internet  is  a  vast  archive,  and  surfaces  the  fears  of  the  “digital  dark  age”  expressed  by  professional  and  amateur  archivists  alike.  I  argue  that only dedicated archival labor, which I frame as “techno-volunteerism,”  can “save” digital information, and I characterize the activities of techno- volunteer archivists as a repertoire of what is referred to in design studies as  “infrastructuring.”  In break 1, “Canon and Repertoire,” I argue that there can be no “canon”  of  rogue  digital  archives,  and  that  in  fact,  such  archives  are  intrinsically  opposed to the very notion of canonicity. Instead, I propose that we place  more  importance  on  defining  the  repertoires  of  digital  use  and  Internet  preservation.   22   Introduction  Chapter 2, “Archival Styles: Universal, Community, and Alternative Dig- ital Preservation Projects,” describes a diverse set of digital archives that I  think exemplify the ascent of rogue cultural memory. I posit three major  archival styles or categories: universal archives, community archives, and  alternative archives, and I list several specific archives in each category. I  then list various fan fiction archives, and explain how fan fiction archives  function as universal, community, and alternative archives simultaneously. Break  2,  “Archive  Elves,”  discusses  digital  archival  work  in  relation  to   theories of free labor and creative labor, especially theatrical labor.  In chapter 3, “Queer and Feminist Archival Cultures: The Politics of Pre- serving Fan Works,” I describe how fan archives serve women and queer  users, and how their value as cultural resources derives largely from their  operation as archives for these communities.  Break 3, “Fan Time versus Media Time,” argues that fan fiction archives  support a temporality that queers and feminizes the time of mass media  synchronization.  In  chapter  4,  “Repertoire  Fills  the  Archive:  Race,  Sexuality,  and  Social  Justice  in  Fandom,”  I  explore  how  a  number  of  digital  archivists  seek  to  diversify their databases through what I call the “repertoire of archive con- tribution,” attempting to attract content in categories that they deem lack- ing. I examine several fanworks “challenges” that explicitly set the goal of  diversifying  fan  fiction  archives  by  incentivizing  fans  to  produce  stories  about  characters  that  are  non-white,  non-Western,  and or  practice  non- normative sexualities. I argue that these challenges invite fans to enact a  kind of “carnival repertoire,” in which they work  play  together, for delim- ited periods of time, to invert and subvert the systemic privileging of white- ness in mass media representations, and to add more stories of difference to  both fan archives and the total archive of media.  Break 4, “‘Works’ or ‘Performances’?,” investigates the traditional distinc- tions between the kinds of cultural productions that constitute archivable  “works” and unarchivable, ephemeral “performances,” and asks how these  differentiations blur when we examine the output of online communities. Chapter 5, “Print Fans versus Net Fans: Women’s Cultural Memory at the  Threshold of New Media,” describes the period in the history of media fan- dom when the Internet was new, and fans understood that they were facing  the imminent migration of their culture from the real world to the virtual  network. I explain that many female fans did not think that their culture,  which  had  always  been  transmitted  through  face-to-face  and  embodied  practices—that is, through repertoire—would survive a “translation” to the  digital, and I read their doubt against the background of a larger cultural    Introduction   23  imaginary, found in cyberpunk narratives and other forms of popular dis- course, that framed women as the last defenders of humanity against the  encroaching reign of machines.  Break 5, “A Femslash Parable of the Print-to-Digital Transition,” is a close  reading of one piece of fan fiction, a Star Trek: Voyager story in which Cap- tain  Janeway  and  one  of  her  crew  members,  the  female  cyborg  Seven  of  Nine, embark on a sexual relationship. I interpret the popularity of Janeway  Seven fan fiction as a desire among female fans for “print fans”  an older  generation  of  fans,  who  had  entered  fandom  as  a  face-to-face  enterprise  that traded printed zines  to reconcile and merge with “net fans”  younger  fans, who had only known fandom as a digitally networked enterprise.   Chapter  6,  “The  Default  Body  and  the  Composed  Body:  Performance  through New Media,” argues that the Internet is a body medium, that is, a  place where users perform through virtual bodies. I argue that when users  appropriate the faces and bodies of actors for their online interactions and  representations,  they  are  performing  through  “composed  bodies,”  while  their  own  physical  bodies  are  “default  bodies.”  I  claim  that  fan  fiction  illustrates  very  well  how  embodiment  is  crucial  to  Internet-based  perfor- mances—in other words, we do not at all leave embodiment behind when  we “go” online.  Break  6,  “Body  and  Voice  in  Fan  Production,”  details  several  kinds  of  performances common in media fandom that are different from fan fiction:  real-world performances  such as “cosplay” or costume play, and childhood  play , audiofic performances  in which fans record themselves reading fan  fictions aloud , and fan casting  in which fans imagine a media property  cast with actors of their choosing; fans often “genderswap” or “racebend”  known characters .  Chapter  7,  “Archontic  Production:  Free  Culture  and  Free  Software  as  Versioning,”  considers  archontic  production  as  a  cultural  analog  to  the  free software movement  launched by programmer Richard Stallman  and  GNU Linux development, and also puts archontic production in relation to  postcolonial, ethnic minority, and feminist theories of culture-as-archive,  and of appropriative-writing-as-performance, that predated the digital age. Whereas  chapter  7  proposes  similarities  between  free  culture  and  free  software, break 7, “Licensing and Licentiousness,” examines an important  difference  between  GNU Linux  hacking  and  the  segment  of  free  culture  constituted by fan production: free software is deeply concerned with licens- ing  e.g., Stallman’s GNU General Public License, which developers use to  “modulate”  copyright  and  permit  others  to  lawfully  modify  their  code ,  while most fans do not concern themselves with questions of the legality    24   Introduction  of their practices, and simply “take license” with the media they consume.  Building on Derrida’s linking of licentiousness to democracy, I suggest that  fan  archivists,  and  all  rogue  archivists,  seek  not  to  resist  current  legal  or  cultural structures but to bring a new kind of democracy into being, one  that fulfills democracy’s promises regarding diversity and transformability. The concluding chapter, “Fan Data: A Digital Humanities Approach to  Internet Archives,” presents the results of a data-scraping project that I led  from 2012 through 2014. An array of data visualizations illustrates the scale  and rate of growth of various fan fiction archives and indicates the massive  size of rogue archiving projects.   Break 0  A Glossary of Key Terms Break  Glossary   of   Key   0 Terms  It may seem strange to begin the body of this book with a break—a “break  0,” a break from a work that has not even properly begun yet—but I intend  this break to be a launching pad, a delivery of fundamental ideas and con- cepts that will, I hope, prove helpful to the reader’s intake of all of the sec- tions that follow.  In  the  introduction,  I  briefly  mentioned  a  number  of  terms—such  as  “digital cultural memory,” “the intersection of new media studies and per- formance studies,” “archontic production,” “fan fiction,” and “fan fiction  archives”—that warrant elaboration. At the very least, the reader should be  aware of how I think about each of these constructs, and what I find to be  significant about them. Therefore, the text below can be read as a glossary  of terms. It is divided into five subsections, each dedicated to a different  question:     What Is Digital Cultural Memory?    What Is “Global Theater”?  or, What Does New Media Studies Have to Do  with Performance Studies?     What Is Archontic Production?    What Is Fan Fiction?    What Are Fan Fiction Archives?  While the subsections may not at first appear to have much to do with one  another, I think that by the end of this break—or at any rate, by the end of  this book—it will be clear that these topics are closely interlinked.  What Is Digital Cultural Memory?  As I wrote in the introduction, I think of digital cultural memory as a double  helix, composed of two intertwining strands. The first strand is made up of  what I call archontic productions  see below . The second strand is made up of    26   Break 0  actual Internet archives. Here I will offer a short background for my think- ing  on  this  second  strand,  the  phenomena  of  archives  that  exist  online   but I will occasionally make reference to the first strand, the genre of digi- tal appropriations and remixes that many digital archives are devoted to  preserving .  My idea of digital cultural memory starts with the fact that “memory  institutions,”  such  as  libraries,  museums,  and  archives,  understand  their  mission  to  be  the  keeping  and  transmission  of  “cultural  memory,”  usu- ally meant in a vernacular rather than an academic way. For these institu- tions, preserving cultural memory means ensuring that significant artifacts  representing the histories of the wider cultures in which they, the institu- tions, operate, are accessible by successive generations. Guy Pessach defines  memory institutions as “social entities that select, document, contextual- ize, preserve, index, and thus canonize elements of humanity’s culture, his- torical narratives, individual and collective memories”  Pessach 2008, 73 .1  Memory institutions have been aware since at least the 1994 Commission  on Preservation and Access that the future of cultural artifacts, both those  born digital and those born analog, will be largely digital, and that, as Julie  Holcomb  2000  writes, “the long-term preservation of digital resources” is  equivalent to “preserving our cultural memory.” The archival and heritage  professions are well aware that the cultural and the digital are increasingly  bound  together,  that  more  and  more  predigital  and  nondigital  cultural  materials must be transcribed or remediated into digital formats  Pascha- lidis  2008,  5;  Bolter  and  Grusin  2000 ,  and  that  more  and  more  cultural  productions,  as  well  as  cultural  preservation  efforts,  are  being  launched  digitally,  as  a  result  of  which,  states  Gregory  Paschalidis,  “a  whole  new  economy of social memory has emerged”  Paschalidis 2008, 4 . This econ- omy is composed not just of professional preservationists and intellectuals  authorized to curate and administer cultural materials for laypeople; it also  encompasses amateur cultural producers and amateur digital archivists.  Paschalidis  writes  that  the  “development  and  diffusion  of  modern   communication  media”  which  has  made  possible  the  “democratization  and pluralization of social memory”  2008, 4  offends and repulses large  numbers  of  cultural  workers.  In  the  context  of  discussions  and  debates   taking  place  among  memory,  heritage,  and  information  resource  profes- sionals, digital cultural memory means cultural memory that lives in and as  digital media, and the fact that vast swaths of nonprofessionals are under- taking micro- and macro-sized missions pertaining to digital cultural mem- ory gives the entire field an “unregulated, decentralized and multi-voiced  character  [that]  plays  havoc  with  our  inherited  routines  and  established    Glossary of Key Terms   27  protocols. … It is no accident, then, that many teachers and intellectuals,  the presumed guardians and characters of cultural memory, revolt against  this  new  social  organization  of  social  memory,  whose  confusing  lack  of  order, center or discipline seems to them as disorienting as amnesia,” Pas- chalidis states  2008, 4 . A condemnation of amateur digital activity, includ- ing amateur archiving, can be found in many cultural critics’ writings from  the 2000s;2 this attitude is well represented by a 2007 article in the Guard- ian that opines, in relation to the Museum of Online Museums, “Nowhere  has  [the  Internet]  been  more  successful  than  in  the  field  of  meaningless  rubbish. Here, vast swathes of tat are housed in one handy place for easy  navigation”  cited in Terras 2010, 426 .  But some information scholars, such as Melissa Terras, have taken a dif- ferent position on the growing ranks of amateur digital archivists, arguing  that “the uncharted territory of digital resources created outside traditional  memory institution boundaries can provide a rich source of materials for  both the general public and academic researchers. Additionally, those creat- ing such online materials are generally more successful in interacting with  their  relevant  online  communities  than  memory  institutions  are.  …  The  best digital resources created by enthusiasts, in their own time and at their  own expense, can inform the library, archive, and cultural heritage com- munity  about  best  practice  in  constructing  online  resources,  and  reach- ing relevant audiences in the process”  Terras 2010, 425–426 . Mizuko Ito   2006 , Charles Leadbeater and Paul Miller  2004 , Ruth Finnegan  2005 ,  Clay Shirky  2008 , Matthew Kirschenbaum et al.  2009 , and Robert Steb- bins  1992, 2001  are among those who laud the cultural memory work per- formed by amateur archivists, both now in the digital era and at every point  in the history of memory institutions, as amateurs have always played a  large  part  in  founding  and  growing  organizations  for  the  preservation  of social and cultural histories, some of which have fed into, or become,  museums and academic research disciplines.3 Leadbeater and Miller  2004   propose the term “Pro-am” as suitable for referring to a person who “pur- sues  an  activity  as  an  amateur,  mainly  for  the  love  of  it,  but  sets  a  pro- fessional  standard”   20 ,  and  Stebbins   1992,  2001   employs  the  phrase  “serious leisure” to describe the commitment and effort that some hobby- ists dedicate to their chosen pursuits; Terras  2010  uses these framings of  amateurs’ labor in her discussion of amateur digital archivists, suggesting  that  amateur  archivists  execute  digital  cultural  memory  projects  that  are  different from professional preservationist work but comparable to it, and  that deserve consideration as serious, rather than ridiculous or random or  trivial, enterprises.   28   Break 0  Digital cultural memory thus refers to a moment in time, a turning point  in the history of memory institutions: the mid-1990s through the present  have been a period of transition from analog to digital formats for librar- ies, museums, and other predigital archives, and a period of emergence for  amateur digital archivists. The role that amateur archivists are playing in  the field of digital cultural memory is growing, and has compelled acknowl- edgment by the archival professions, acknowledgment that has manifested  as condemnation by some circles, and as approbation by others.  The phrase digital cultural memory also flags an uneasy overlap of new  media studies with the research field defined as “memory studies,” which  analyzes the historical, political, and philosophical significance of personal  and collective recollection. Memory studies goes back at least as far as Pla- to’s  2005 [360 BCE]  Phaedrus,4 but the field in its contemporary form5 was  initiated by Maurice Halbwachs’s Social Frameworks of Memory  1925, in On  Collective Memory [1992] , in which Halbwachs articulated his theory of col- lective memory. Halbwachs argues that, as individuals form their memories  in society, “It is also in society that they recall, recognize, and localize their  memories. … [Memories] are recalled to me externally, and the groups of  which I am a part at any time give me the means to reconstruct them”  Hal- bwachs 1992, 38 . Jeffrey Olick, Vered Vinitzky-Seroussi, and Daniel Levy  summarize Halbwachs’ theory of collective memory when they write, “All  individual remembering … takes place with social materials, within social  contexts,  and  in  response  to  social  cues”   2011,  19 .  One  implication  of  Halbwachs’s work is that a society’s technologies for storing and retrieving  its memories influence and inform how and what individuals recollect; as  Halbwachs states, the “means to reconstruct them [memories]” are given by  the society to the individual. Thus, how digital technologies affect collec- tive “remembering” is a point of interest for memory studies.  Jan and Aleida Assmann, drawing on Halbwachs’s theories and on Aby  Warburg’s 1930s writings on social memory, advanced their idea of cultural  memory beginning in the 1980s.6 Jan Assmann  1995  points out that Hal- bwachs’s  and  Warburg’s  thinking  resisted  the  nineteenth-century  notion  that collective memory depended on biological inheritance  “racial mem- ory” [125] and “survival of the type” [125–126] , and proposed the alterna- tive that cultural memory is the technology by which a society survives.  Each generation transmits culture to the next, not through genetic inheri- tance, but through the conservation and repeated reexamination or reuse  of cultural objects and rituals—“cultural formation[s]  texts, rites, monu- ments  and institutional communication  recitation, practice, observance ”   129 —that  constitute  a  society’s  “objectivized  culture”   128 .  Assmann  uses Warburg’s capacious idea of objectivized culture, which included “not    Glossary of Key Terms   29  only works of high art,” but also “posters, postage stamps, costumes, cus- toms,  etc.”   129 ,  which,  Warburg  argued,  possess  a  type  of  “mnemonic  energy”  129 .  Taking  up  the  Assmanns’  and  Warburg’s  arguments  that  objects  and  practices—including  those  that  originate  in  so-called  low  and  everyday  culture—are  bearers  of  cultural  memory,  media  scholars  over  the  past  twenty  years  have  investigated  how  collective  memory  and  social  iden- tity are consolidated and transmitted through communities’ uses of media  texts,  such  as  photographs,  pop  and  rock  songs,  films,  television  broad- casts,  and  digital  communications.7  In  line  with  this  branch  of  media  studies, fan fiction and other genres of transformative fan works, as well  as  the  source  texts  that  inspire  them,  can  be  seen  as  cultural  memory  objects,  possessing  the  kind  of  “mnemonic  energy”  that  Warburg  attrib- uted to posters and postage stamps. Fan communities define their group  identities in part through what Warburg calls “costumes” and “customs”   dressing up as favorite characters and gathering together at fan- or indus- try-organized conventions, a type of public performance called “cosplay,”  is  a  long-standing  fannish  tradition  that  combines  costumes  and  cus- toms ,  and  in  part  through  collecting,  circulating,  consuming,  and  dis- cussing  fannish  objects,  both  industry  issued  and  fan  made.  Fan  fiction  and fan fiction archives help to reinforce fans’ sense of participating in a  common culture. Within a given fandom, the practices of writing and or  reading fanfic are themselves acts of remembrance  of the source text and  of  the  affective  charge  fans  experience  when  interacting  with  the  source  text ,  and  archives  of  that  fandom’s  fiction  writing  are  aggregators  of  fans’ remembrances, which are plural and diverse, but recognizable as all  belonging to a specific fandom. Fic archives thus embody and convey the  cultural  memory  of  specific  fandoms,  as  well  as  the  cultural  memory  of  the larger enterprise of media fandom. For all fan archives, and the prac- tices and rituals involved in making and using fan archives, perpetuate the  cultural memory of what it is to be a media fan.  However, even as communities regard digital artifacts as instantiations  and  transmitters  of  cultural  memory,  and  eagerly  build  Internet  archives  in  order  to  preserve  their  access  to  these  objects  and  practices,  there  is  great  uncertainty  about  digital  media’s  capacity  to  serve  as  a  vehicle  for  cultural  memory  over  long  periods  of  time.  Digital  technologies  are  not  perfect archival technologies; rather, they tend toward loss and disappear- ance. Paschalidis, citing Robert Darnton, states that the “singular, distress- ing  law  that  governs  digital  evolution”  is  that  “hardware  and  software  become obsolete so rapidly as to condemn all digital texts ‘to belong to an  endangered species’”  Paschalidis 2008, 6; Darnton 2008, 79 . The rapidity    30   Break 0  with which digital material is vanishing raises alarms in Geert Lovink that  echo the fears of cultural amnesia expressed by memory studies scholars.  Lovink writes, “Because of the speed of events, there is a real danger that  an online phenomenon will already have disappeared before a critical dis- course reflecting on it has had the time to mature and establish itself as  institutionally  recognized  knowledge”   Lovink  2011,  8 .  In  other  words,  if digital objects and practices do not remain accessible long enough to be  thoroughly understood by the society that produces them, there may be no  digital cultural memory at all. Jan Assmann writes that “cultural memory  comprises that body of reusable texts, images, and rituals specific to each  society  in  each  epoch,  whose  ‘cultivation’  serves  to  stabilize  and  convey  that society’s self-image”  Assmann 1995, 132 , and if digital texts are not  reusable, if Internet rituals that arise around those texts are not reenactable,  then societies in this epoch, at the dawn of the digital age, cannot be sta- bilized. Even as people increasingly use digital networks and platforms to  create  and  archive  cultural  productions,  the  relationship  between  digital  technologies and cultural memory is tenuous at best.  In chapter 1, I will explore some of the questions that arise from think- ing “digital cultural memory” together with “memory studies”: How can  communities employ digital tools in making and preserving culture, while  at the same time, digital texts become inaccessible or unusable so rapidly  that digital technologies are sometimes characterized as antiarchival? How  can cultural memory, as defined by memory studies, be served by digital  platforms that are never permanent? Are online communities, and other  communities reliant on digital tools to bear their group identities into the  future, condemned to short life spans commensurate with the abbreviated  utility of these tools?  I will argue that online archives can only be made stable, reliable, and  accessible over the long term by human labor. One of my central claims  is that digital technologies are not innately archival, but must be made to  serve archival purposes by the constant efforts of archivists. Thus, the sec- ond referent of digital cultural memory is a labor requirement: communi- ties must work to conserve their digital artifacts and rituals, or risk losing  them to the digital’s proclivity for ephemerality and loss.  What Is “Global Theater”?  or, What Does New Media Studies Have to Do  with Performance Studies?   What  does  performance  studies  have  to  do  with  new  media  studies?  Or:  Why use performance studies in an analysis of Internet cultures and digital    Glossary of Key Terms   31  phenomena? My answer is: New media studies has had quite a long history  of  borrowing  metaphors  and  frameworks  from  the  fields  of  drama,  the- ater, and performance, and while this genealogy may not be well known to  either performance scholars or new media scholars, it is an important one;  I situate my work within this robust, if unheralded, school of thought. I will  briefly review the major intersections between new media studies and per- formance studies, and then, in the next section, I will explain why I believe  that it is useful to think “new media” and “performance” together when  studying online fan cultures and fan archiving.  Marshall McLuhan, one of the key founders of what we today call new  media studies, first compared new media to performance in 1970, when he  sought to replace his 1962 term “global village” with a new term: “global  theater.” In From Cliché to Archetype, McLuhan  1970  writes, “Since Sputnik  [launched  in  1957]  put  the  globe  in  a  ‘proscenium  arch,’  and  the  global  village has been transformed into a global theater, the result, quite literally,  is the use of public space for ‘doing one’s thing’”  12 . The “global village”  has become the “global theater”  apparently in 1957, even before McLuhan  first  mentioned  the  “global  village,”  but  let  us  not  scrutinize  McLuhan’s  chronology  too  closely   as  a  result  of  the  telecommunications  networks  that cross the world, making every place on the planet a potential perfor- mance space.8  McLuhan’s  replacement  of  “village”  with  “theater”  as  his  preferred  metaphor  is  read  by  John  Tinnell  as  a  commentary  on  live  video  trans- mission. Tinnell  2011  writes, “Widespread televisual applications of sat- ellite technology cultivated a tele-performative space, which … added an  awareness that whatever took place in the presence of various electronic  recording  devices  could  be  broadcast  to  and  seen  by  large  audiences  all  across  the  world,  in  real  time  and  for  all  time.  This  awareness  becomes  a force of enculturation; one does not need to possess a video camera to  be ontologically affected by the cultural  f act of televisual recording and  worldwide  broadcasting.”  While  I  agree  with  Tinnell  that  McLuhan  had  global live television in mind when he declared that the world is now a  theater, the implications of McLuhan’s “global theater” extend well beyond  the medium of television.  The Internet, more than television  indeed, the two are increasingly con- verging , is a public space for “doing one’s thing,” each participant gener- ating his or her own content, putting on his or her own show, as it were.  The  Internet  “turns  the  globe  into  a  repertory  theater  to  be  programed”   McLuhan  1970,  9–10   by  its  participants.  The  Internet  realizes  McLu- han’s vision of a space that serves as a stage that is theoretically open to    32   Break 0  an infinite number of players, each doing their thing for others to witness,  and  thus  contributing  “programming”  to  the  nonstop  theater.  McLuhan  is  even  clearer  in  his  prediction  of  a  networked  participatory  culture  in  his 1972 book, Take Today: The Executive as Dropout  coauthored with Bar- rington Nevitt , when he writes of “the institution of a new kind of global  theater, in which all men become actors and there are few spectators. The  population of the world is both the cast and content of this new theater.  The repertory of the theater consists of a perpetual happening, which can  include the retrieval or replay of any previous happenings that men choose  to experience”  McLuhan and Nevitt 1972, 145 .  Thus McLuhan introduces the link between new media and theater, pre- dicting future telecommunications platforms that will be open to participa- tion by all  all who can gain access to the platforms and have the knowledge  to use them, that is . From McLuhan’s phrase “perpetual happening,” and  his  statement  that  “all  men  become  actors  and  there  are  few  spectators”  we  can  see  the  influence  of  1950s  and  1960s  performance  culture—spe- cifically, the famous “Happenings” by Allan Kaprow and others—on early  1970s new media theory. The connection that McLuhan perceives between  performance and new media is interactivity, and McLuhan would not be the  only new media theorist to see this resonance: in The New Media Reader,  Noah Wardrip-Fruin and Nick Montfort  2003  write that “the idea of inter- action associated with Happenings [in the fifties and sixties] was profoundly  inspiring and has remained so for decades” as that idea “reflected and pro- voked a desire to break down distinctions between creator and audience—a  desire and activity now central for many new media practitioners. … The  ‘Happenings’ are a touchstone for nearly every discussion of new media as  it relates to interactivity in art”  83 .  Numerous new media theorists after McLuhan  though none cite him   have  argued  that  all  human–computer  interaction   HCI ,  and  not  only  computer-based art-making, is most fruitfully conceptualized as a form of  interactive performance. Brenda Laurel’s Computers as Theater  1991 , Sherry  Turkle’s Life on the Screen  1995 , Allucquére Rosanne Stone’s essay “Will the  Real Body Please Stand Up?”  1991 , and Stone’s book The War of Desire and  Technology at the Close of the Mechanical Age  1996  all argue that new media  actions  and  engagements  are  types  of  performance  because  they  invite,  and  often  require,  computer  users’  interactions  with  hardware  and  soft- ware and or other users via digital networks. Laurel, an interface designer,  relates  that  designers  often  regard  theatergoing  as  a  model  for  HCI:  “As  researchers  grapple  with  the  notion  of  interaction  in  the  world  of  com- puting, they sometimes compare computer users to theatrical audiences”    Glossary of Key Terms   33   1991, 16 . Laurel’s own view is that users resemble actors more than they  do audience members: “People who are participating in the representation  [of actions on their computer screens] aren’t audience members anymore.  … They become actors—and the notion of ‘passive’ observers disappears. In  a theatrical view of human–computer activity, the stage is a virtual world”   17 . Turkle writes that the interactivity of computer use has the potential  to boost each user’s sense of being an autonomous individual, of “being  an actor in one’s life”  1995, 274 . Stone states that “Computers are arenas  for social experience and dramatic interaction, a type of media more like  a public theater” than like prior forms of electronic media, such as cinema   1996, 16 .  Erving Goffman’s 1956 book The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life also  began to be explicitly cited by new media theorists in the 1980s and 1990s,  as performance studies  of which Goffman’s Presentation is a foundational  text   became  established  as  a  discipline   or  what  Shannon  Jackson  calls  an “anti-discipline”  in the US academy  Jackson 2004, 30 . Goffman pro- poses that every person is an actor playing a variety of roles in her daily  life—that anytime “the individual is in the immediate presence of others,”  the individual expresses herself and tries to manage others’ impressions of  her, and in doing so, performs  Goffman 1956, 1–4 . Goffman’s concept of  everyday social performance resonates with McLuhan’s notion of a “global  theater” in which all are actors; Joshua Meyrowitz’s No Sense of Place: The  Impact of Electronic Media on Social Behavior  1985  was the first to combine  Goffman’s and McLuhan’s concepts. Although Meyrowitz’s  1985  analysis  centers on television and has limited application to contemporary network  technologies, he puts forward the notion that “electronic media [effect] a  very discernible rearrangement of the social stages on which we play our  roles”  4 . Goffman has been, by far, the most influential performance theo- rist on new media scholars.9 Goffman’s perspective on performance comes  through  clearly  in  statements  such  as  this  one  by  Annette  Markham  in  her  essay  “The  Dramaturgy  of  Digital  Experience”:  “Regardless  of  which  device or interface I’m using, what I’m wearing, or where I’m located I am  performing multiple roles on multiple simultaneous stages with a globally  distributed range of actual and potential audiences”  Markham 2013, 280 . McLuhan, Laurel, Turkle, Stone, and the diverse and growing group of  Goffman-influenced new media theorists all stress that network technolo- gies facilitate what Mark Poster  2012  calls “many-to-many communica- tion.”  In  a  global  telecom  network,  everyone  can  perform;  the  networks  are  like  open  stages  that  users  fill  with  their  performances.  Importantly,  liveness or presence is not a defining characteristic of performance for any    34   Break 0  of these thinkers. What is regarded as an essential feature of “performance”  to  many  performance  theorists—physical  bodies  that  are  copresent  with  one  another  at  the  time  and  place  of  action—is  not  at  all  necessary  for  “performance”  as  conceived  by  new  media  studies.  Stone  addresses  this  issue directly, stating, “We have to rethink some assumptions about pres- ence,” as major “shifts in cultural beliefs and practices” are giving on to  “repeated transgressions of the traditional concept of the body’s physical  envelope  and  of  the  locus  of  human  agency”   Stone  1996,  16 .  In  other  words, human agency, and therefore human presence, is no longer located  exclusively in the human body. Stone claims that the computer is “a tech- nological  object  that  acts  as  a  channel  or  representative  for  [physically]  absent human agencies”  16–17   Stone acknowledges her indebtedness to  Laurel  on  this  point .  But  Stone  is  rare  among  new  media  theorists  who  explicitly  deal  with  the  challenge  that  metaphors  of  online-interaction- as-performance  pose  to  definitions  of  performance-as-presence.  The  vast  majority of new media scholars simply assume that bodily presence is not  necessary  for  performance,  and  that,  following  McLuhan,  Goffman,  and  the aforementioned theorists, every person performs on the virtual stage of  the Internet each time he or she posts a comment, shares a link, publishes  a fan work, or builds an Internet archive.10  Therefore,  when  I  draw  on  metaphors  and  vocabularies  of  theater,  drama, and performance to describe the activities of Internet fan archivists,  I feel myself to be working within a well-developed branch of new media  theory that was founded more than four decades ago.  What Is Archontic Production?  My theory of archontic production is that many readers, filmgoers, gamers,  and television viewers engage deeply with the “archive” of media culture,  which  is  the  array  of  perceptible  cultural  artifacts  distributed  widely  for  mass consumption. From this archive of source texts, media users select the  texts they want to work with, and from those texts, they extract what they  like and what they need, using those extractions as the raw materials for  their own cultural productions, such as fan fiction.  A  virtual  archive—let  us  call  it  a  “meta-archive”11—is  opened  by  each  source text, and encompasses not only that source text but all variations  and transformations of it produced by readers, viewers, listeners, scholars,  critics, and fans. These meta-archives, comprising every version of a source  text that have ever been imagined, told, played, sung, written, or recorded  in an audiovisual medium, are conceptual rather than perceptible.   Glossary of Key Terms   35  I have appropriated the word “archontic” from Jacques Derrida’s essay  “Archive Fever,” in which Derrida states that no archive can ever be said to  be finished or fully completed. “The archive is never closed. It opens out of  the future”  Derrida 1995, 45 , he writes. Derrida recalls the original ties of  the concept and term “archive” to the archons, the lawmakers or “superior  magistrates”  9  in Greek society who housed the official documents of the  polis in their homes. “The archons are first of all the documents’ guardians.  They do not only ensure the physical security of what is deposited and of  the  substrate.  They  are  also  accorded  the  hermeneutic  right  and  compe- tence. They have the power to interpret the archives”  10 . I use “archontic”  to  signal  a  new  identification  of  the  “archons”  of  culture.  Who  has  the  power to interpret the archives of mass media? I argue that it is the audi- ences, the consumers, the users of media.  And I would also argue that it is these new archons who have taken it  upon themselves to “ensure the [digital] security of what is deposited and  of the substrate” in the meta-archives of mass media. A great deal of digital  cultural memory is composed of archontic producers on the one hand, and  archivists of archontic productions on the other.  What Is Fan Fiction?  Fan fiction  also called “fanfiction,” “fanfic,” or simply “fic”  refers to sto- ries  written  by  fans  of  mass-produced  texts   of  any  genre  and  all  media,  from  comics  to  video  games  to  novels  to  television  programs  to  popular  music   that  appropriate  the  characters  of  the  textual  universe,  and  occa- sionally  other  elements  as  well,  such  as  story  arcs,  settings,  narrative  themes,  and  so  on,  but  are  original  stories.  The  practice  of  revising  and  augmenting  received  stories  is  ancient—the  creation  of  folklore,  mythol- ogy, and tall tales depends on this practice12—but the beginning of fan fic- tion as it is currently understood, as a form of creative appropriation by  predominantly female communities organized as “fandoms” around mass  media productions, can perhaps be dated to the first issue of the first Star  Trek fanzine, Spockanalia, printed and released in 1967  Fanlore, “Spockana- lia” .13 Beginning in the early 1990s, fans began to post fan fiction on the  Internet  in chapter 5, I discuss the period of transition from zine-based, or  “print” fandom, to Internet-based, or “Net” fandom , and today, the vast  majority of fan fiction is published and distributed online rather than in  printed formats.  Fan  fiction  stories  usually  expand  on  potentialities  that  inhere  in  the  “source”  texts:  adventures  that  the  characters  could  have  had  but  never    36   Break 0  did; relationships or sexual encounters they might have had but didn’t—or  which were never portrayed onscreen; events in the characters’ lives that  may have taken place before, after, or in between the events described in  the source material. Many “fics” do not adhere very closely to their source  texts, and only borrow characters in order to put them in “alternate uni- verse” or “crossover” settings: for example, two characters in a movie about  a postapocalyptic wasteland might be “ficced” as a couple who meet in a  contemporary  coffee  shop,  or  in  a  Regency-era  ballroom,  or  at  Hogwarts  School  of  Witchcraft  and  Wizardry;  two  straight-identifying  characters  might  be  “ficced”  as  having  a  same-sex  relationship;  a  character  who  is  male in the source text might be written as a female in a fanfic. The attitude  of fan fiction to its source material is thus usually a strange combination of  fidelity and infidelity: a work of fanfic may be much the same as the source  in certain respects but very different in others. It is this hybridity of repeti- tion and difference in fan fiction that has led fan scholars to make a strong  case that performance studies and theater studies offer the best frameworks  for understanding fan fiction.  Kurt  Lancaster   2001   uses  Richard  Schechner’s  theory  of  “restored  behavior”  1985, 35–36  to describe fan fiction writing and reading: “Mem- ories  of  …  actors’  performances  of  their  characters  reside  within  the  fan  texts, and writers as well as readers restore these performances through this  work. … A fan fiction author places strips of behavior garnered from watch- ing  episodes  of  [a  television  show]  into  new  contexts.  The  reader  of  the  fanfic  imagines  the  immaterial  behaviors  occurring  in  the  story  as  being  concrete, or performed”  Lancaster 2001, 132–133 . Schechner argues that  all performance, “from shamanism and exorcism to trance, from ritual to  aesthetic dance and theater, from initiation rites to social dramas,” consists  of restored behavior, by which Schechner means “living behavior treated  as a film director treats a strip of film. These strips of behavior can be rear- ranged or reconstructed”  Schechner 1985, 35 . In Lancaster’s conception  of  fan  fiction,  fan  writers  do  not  physically  rearrange  or  reconstruct  the  strips of behavior that they witness actors performing into new live per- formances   “living  behavior” ,  but  they  effectuate  such  reconstructions  through  their  fanfic  stories,  and  so  produce  performances  in  their  read- ers’  imaginations.  Fan  fiction  stories  therefore  resemble  performances,  and operate according to performance principles, more than other kinds  of  fiction  stories  do,  because  fan  stories,  at  least  those  that  are  based  on  audiovisual media texts, intentionally and explicitly strive to evoke actors’  physicality  their facial expressions, styles of movement, and vocal intona- tions  in written form, and readers of fanfic understand that they should    Glossary of Key Terms   37  create mental images of specific actors performing the original scenes that  the fan author describes—they know that they should envision those actors  “playing” the scenes that the fan author has written for them.  Lancaster’s  reasoning  suggests  a  comparison  between  fan  fiction  and  screenplays, and Francesca Coppa’s essay “Writing Bodies in Space”  2006   makes this comparison explicit. Coppa relates that “some fan fiction has  been written in script or teleplay form, often by fans who aspired to write  for [a] produced show. … To write in script form would be a sign of a writer’s  aspiring professionalism” in the 1970s and 1980s  Coppa 2006b, 234–235 .  “But  the  script  form  has  always  been  unpopular  among  readers,”  Coppa  states,  “so  a  fan  whose  primary  audience  was  other  fans  rather  than  the  television  industry  was  more  likely  to  tell  her  dramatic  story  in  prose”   235 . Coppa’s point is that even though most fan fiction stories are written  as prose rather than in teleplay format, all fan stories are essentially scripts:  “The existence of the teleplay [as a format that fan authors occasionally use]  helps to demonstrate fan fiction’s roots as an essentially dramatic literature,  but the larger part of my argument is that fan fiction directs bodies in space  even when it’s not overtly written in theatrical form”  235 . Coppa echoes  Lancaster when she writes that fan writers and readers “bring our memories  of [actors’] physicality to the [fan] text, so the [fan] reader is precharged”   236 , that is, ready to imagine the actors playing out the scenarios written  by the fan writer. “We’ve met these characters already, and now we’re see- ing them again. In theatre, we call that a production,” writes Coppa  236 .  To think of fan fiction as a performance genre is a similar move to the one  that the “global theater” thinkers make in identifying networked commu- nications, including textual communications, as performances, as theater.  For Lancaster and Coppa, as for the global theater theorists, writing can be  performance. But the concept of global theater is that each person puts on  a performance online, that each of us is an actor on the virtual stage con- stituted by digital networks, while Lancaster and Coppa propose that fan  writers script and direct the action of what Coppa calls “bodies in space,”  the  actors  whose  screen  performances  fans  admire,  and  the  fan-directed  enactments of these bodies take place on a virtual stage that is not online,  but in fan writers’ and readers’ imaginations. We know, from the existence  of  fanzines  and  other  earlier  print-based  forms  of  archontic  fiction,  that  fan fiction-as-performance predates the Internet; the virtual stage on which  archontic productions take place—the “mind’s eye” of audiences—certainly  has a longer history than the virtual stage of telecommunications networks  on which global theater plays out.   38   Break 0  What Are Fan Fiction Archives?  Fan fiction archives are repositories of fan fiction stories, where authors can  deposit their fics and readers of fics can retrieve them. Morgan Dawn  2012   spoke to my research team about donating her large store of fanzines to the  University  of  Iowa  Libraries’  Zine  and  Amateur  Press  Collections   http:   www.lib.uiowa.edu sc resources zineresources  , following the lead of her  friend  and  fellow  fan  organizer  Sandy  Herrold,  and  other  zine  collectors  have done the same. The University of Iowa Collections constitute what is  currently the most visible and widely accessible archive of fan fiction  and  other forms of fan works, including fan art and fan commentary  published  from the 1960s through the 1980s. But Internet fan-fiction production has,  from the 1990s to the present, been archived primarily in fan-built digital  archives   I  describe  a  number  of  major  online  fic  archives  in  chapter  2 .  Typically, online fan fiction archives are databases that contain all of the  stories submitted to the archivists by authors; archivists organize the stories  according to various categories of metadata  source title, story title, author  name, characters [prominently featured in the fanfic], rating [from general  to mature], genre, etc. , to make the databases easily searchable by readers. If, following Lancaster and Coppa, we consider fan fiction to be perfor- mances, as stagings, as variants of source texts that are not “derivative” but  are  simply  diverse  productions  of  popular  texts,  and  if  we  also  take  into  account that these sorts of fan performances are far older than electronic  network  technologies,  we  must  define  fan  fiction  archives  as  something  other than simply periodically updated databases.  Every fan fiction archive is, in some sense, a concrete, visible incarnation  of a wide variety of performances based on that source material. The Lord  of the Rings archive, the Avengers archive, the Romeo and Juliet archive are  all virtual meta-archives, as I explained above. A meta-archive cannot be  seen; it is a construct, a metaphor that allows me to describe the relation of  adaptations, transmediations, remixes, commentaries and fan texts to one  another and to their sources. Lancaster’s and Coppa’s theories allow me to  assert that fan fiction archives embody and make perceptible these formerly  only-virtual  meta-archives.  A  meta-archive  grows  without  limit;  it  keeps  growing as long as audiences keep encountering the source material and  transforming  it.  Before  Internet  fan  archives,  it  would  have  been  impos- sible to visualize any one always-increasing meta-archive, except possibly  by placing every fan fiction zine in a given fandom on the same shelf—and  even then, only the fans who had physical access to that shelf would have  been able to read through all of the contents of that collection. But Internet    Glossary of Key Terms   39  fan fiction archives make visible and accessible multitudes of stories that  have been written in a given fandom.  Fan fiction archives put all of the  public and published  performances  based on a given source text on display, for fan readers’ engagement. It is  as if Shakespeare enthusiasts were able to see all  or, at least, many  of the  performances of Hamlet being produced simultaneously, in one giant per- forming arts building containing innumerable stages, each stage occupied  by a different company offering their unique take, revision, or reworking  of Hamlet. A Shakespeare fan could walk from stage to stage to stage inside  that  enormous  building,  watching  Hamlet  after  Hamlet  after  Hamlet,  and  when he reached what he thought was the last stage and the last version of  Hamlet, he might find that the structure had the capacity to expand infi- nitely, and that new stages, with new performances of Hamlet being played  out on them, were being added on to the building all the time.  What does it matter whether we can “see” a meta-archive or not? What  does  it  signify  that  fan  archives  make  visible  these  constantly  growing  meta-archives that were, before the Internet, only conceptual? One signifi- cance is that fan archives finally put to rest a question that has been asked  about consumers of popular culture and popular media for centuries, which  is:  Are  audiences  of  mass  texts  passive  or  active?  Do  they  merely  receive  ideas and ideological messages that are “injected” into them by the media  they consume  the “hypodermic needle” theory of media reception ,14 or  is  there  some  kind  of  active  response  engendered  in  them  by  their  acts  of consumption  the “active audience” theory of media reception ?15 For  decades,  cultural  studies  scholars  have  argued  that  audiences  are  active,  that they make their own meanings of texts, that they are never wholly pas- sive in their intake of media.16 Fan scholars, without exception, have made  the same claims. But online fan archives, and all collections of remix—in  fact, the rising popularity of remix as a new literacy, made possible by the  affordances  of  digital  and  Internet  technologies—serve  as  evidence  that  audiences actively and imaginatively engage with media texts. Audiences  create in response to the media texts they receive. Acts of media reception  spur acts of media production. Internet archives of fan appropriations and  remixes  are  deeply  important  because  the  massive  quantities  of  creative  output that they contain constitute a kind of proof that audiences are not  “cultural dopes”  Hall 1998, 446 , that is, the dupes of mass culture, but are  users of mass culture, who take from media texts what they desire to incor- porate in their own archontic productions.    1  Memory Machine Myth: The Memex, Media  Archaeology, and Repertoires of Archiving Chapter  Memory   Machine   1 Myth  The Internet Is Not a Memory Machine  The Internet, the World Wide Web, and desktop and mobile digital tele- communications devices comprise a system of networked computing that  is often framed as a giant memory machine, a comprehensive and infinitely  expansive archive, which automatically saves users’ posts and emails; the  sites they have visited; and the text, image, and video content they have  uploaded,  downloaded,  emailed,  or  blogged reblogged tweeted pinned  tagged. From this supposed total archive, users will presumably be able to  retrieve elements and traces of  what will be  their digital histories far into  the future.  However, the system of networked computing fails as an archive much  of  the  time.  The  Internet,  far  from  autosaving  all  that  we  do  and  share  there,  is  what  Wendy  Chun   2008   calls  an  “enduring  ephemeral.”  “The  internet may be available 24 7, but specific content may not”  167 , Chun  writes. In other words, the near-constant availability and functionality of  the network itself may suggest that everything that traverses the network  is permanent and durable, but this association between the persistence of  the  Internet  and  the  persistence  of  online  content  is  a  delusion,  a  false  equivalence. In this chapter, I will argue that when the Internet does work  well as an archive, it is because of the initiative and interventions of what I  call “techno-volunteers”: self-appointed, mostly nonprofessional individu- als and collectives who regard some digital cultural productions and events  as worth preserving, and who choose to devote their skills, time, effort, and  often their own finances to constructing and maintaining online archives.  Networked  digital  culture  is  “saved”  for  future  generations,  not  primar- ily through any automated operations, but through the labors of human  actors.   42   Chapter 1  Origins of the Memory Machine Myth  The  myth  that  the  Internet,  combined  with  networked  computers,  con- stitutes a massive digital memory machine is as old as the concept of the  Internet itself. Vannevar Bush, who served in World War II as Director of  the Office of Scientific Research and Development  OSRD   in which role  he coordinated the military research activities of scientists at government  and private institutions throughout the United States , first proposed the  research project that would become first the ARPANET, than the Internet,  in an essay called “As We May Think” that appeared in the Atlantic in July  1945. In the essay, Bush outlines his idea for a device called the “memex,”  which would be a desk-sized machine linked to a large network of infor- mation. The memex, writes Bush, will be a “mechanized private file and  library,” “a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and  communications,  and  which  is  mechanized  so  that  it  may  be  consulted  with exceeding speed and flexibility,” and will serve as “an enlarged inti- mate  supplement  to  his  [a  human  user’s]  memory”   Bush  1945,  sec.  6 .  Bush describes the memex as a large desk housing scrolls of microfilm, on  which are recorded documents, notes, and “associative trails”  sec. 8 , that  is, links between specific documents, or mental pathways through sets of  material, forged by the user  see figure 1.1 .  Bush’s  memex  concept  influenced  many  of  the  scientists  and  engi- neers who architected the Internet and other networked computing tech- nologies, such as J. C. R. Licklider, who wrote seminal papers in the early  1960s proposing interactive networked computers that would be operated  through graphical user interfaces  GUIs , and whose 1965 Libraries of the  Future quotes Bush’s “As We May Think” on its first page; Douglas Engel- bart,  whose  Augmented  Research  Center  team  invented  the  computer  mouse and did pioneering development on hyperlinking, networking, and  GUIs; and Ted Nelson, who coined the terms “hypertext” and “hyperme- dia.” Nelson makes Bush’s impact on his thinking clear when he begins a  1972 paper on hypertext with the sentence “Bush was right”  Nelson [1972]  1991, 245   this paper of Nelson’s is entitled “As We Will Think,” a direct  homage to Bush’s “As We May Think” .1 Licklider, Engelbart, and Nelson’s  work in the 1960s and early 1970s, answering the call issued by Bush in  his 1945 essay, gave rise to the Internet and to the system of networked,  graphical, hyperlinking, personal computing that forms the basis of con- temporary digital culture.   Bush can thus be credited as one of the “fathers” of the Internet. As head  of the OSRD, which oversaw the Manhattan Project and the manufacture of    Memory Machine Myth   43  Figure 1.1 A drawing of Vannevar Bush’s proposed “memex” machine. From LIFE, September  10, 1945, 123.  the first generation of nuclear weapons, he was also one of the “fathers” of  “the bomb.”2 It is not coincidental, I think, that Bush’s “As We May Think”  appeared in print just one month prior to the US military’s August 1945  release of atomic bombs over the Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  At the time that he wrote “As We May Think,” Bush almost certainly had  full advance knowledge of the plan to use atom bombs on Japan, and in  the essay, he alludes to the horrors of nuclear warfare and its world-destroy- ing potential—a potential that he knew the entire world would soon learn  about—and  contrasts  it  with  the  world-saving  potential  of  the  memex.  Bush writes that US scientists, having banded together so effectively dur- ing wartime for “the making of strange destructive gadgets,” should now  turn their talents toward “objectives worthy of their best.” In other words,  having become creators of killing machines for use in a global armed con- flict, one that “appears to be approaching an end,” scientists should, in the  postwar period, turn their talents to the creation of machines that will have    44   Chapter 1  “lasting benefit” to humanity  Bush 1945, sec. 1 . His proposal for such a  machine is the memex. Bush states: “The applications of science … have  enabled him [the human] to throw masses of people against one another  with cruel weapons. They may yet allow him truly to encompass the great  record  and  to  grow  in  the  wisdom  of  race  experience.  He  may  perish  in  conflict before he learns to wield that record for his true good. Yet, in the  application of science to the needs and desires of man, it would seem to be  a singularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to lose  hope as to the outcome”  sec. 8 .  What may take place next in the course of human history, Bush seems to  indicate, is the end of human history, that is, the end of the human. The ter- mination of the species may be brought about by the invention of weapons  of mass destruction, made possible by scientific research. But Bush proposes  that, just as his network of American science and technology researchers  has produced weapons that can usher in the final phase of human history— global nuclear war—so can the same network turn itself, in peacetime, to  the purpose of augmenting human intelligence—with the memex—to the  point that humans will be able to “wield” “the great record” for “his [the   human’s]  true  good”   Bush  1945,  sec.  8 .  Bush  pits  the  memex  against   the atom bomb in a timed race: either human research will bring about the  destruction of humanity, or it will increase humans’ capacity for learning  and thought by such a degree that humans will, at last, be wise enough  to serve their own “true good”  a world without war, perhaps? . In Bush’s  worldview, both the atom bomb and the memex are all-encompassing tech- nologies. Bush seems to perceive postwar humanity as confronting a binary  choice: total war, or complete archive. One or the other will be humanity’s  future, in Bush’s immediately pre-postwar prognostication.  The Memory Machine Myth after Bush  The Internet thus began as a fantasy of the perfect archive, a technology  that  would  preserve  the  vast  record  of  human  knowledge  in  its  entirety.  That  fantasy  has  accompanied  the  network  from  1945  to  the  present,  becoming pervasive in both scholarly and popular discourses.  Noah Wardrip-Fruin, commenting on Ted Nelson’s “dream of hyperme- dia” as it was laid out in Nelson’s groundbreaking Literary Machines  first  published in 1980 and revised and published nine additional times between  1981 and 1993 , points out that Nelson’s dream was in large part a vision of  “the ultimate archive.” Writes Wardrip-Fruin  2000 ,   Memory Machine Myth   45  Consider the dream of hypermedia, put forth by Ted Nelson and others over the last  three decades: That, in a not-so-distant future, we read and write  view and draw,  hear and compose  most everything from and to a world-spanning network. That  everyone have the ability to produce their own documents, and connect them with  any other public documents. That the author may constantly create new versions  of his or her own document, and individuals may create their own versions of any  public document. … That historical backtrack and degradation-proof storage allows  us to visit any version, any moment in the network’s history. To have the ultimate  archive, and yet have each element of the archive constantly in process. Dynamism  without loss. Impermanence enfolded within permanence.  Nelson’s hope continued Bush’s: they shared the dream that the system of  networked computing would prove to be a more robust, capacious, com- plete, and durable archive than had ever existed before.  Today, it is not uncommon to come across academic texts that subscribe  to the Bush–Nelson line of thinking about the Internet as an archive. For  example,  the  authors  of  Digital  Humanities  write,  “Ubiquitous  networks  have  led  and  will  continue  to  lead  to  evolutions  in  pedagogy  precisely  because they involve the outsourcing of memory. … We would be ignor- ing  precedent  completely  if  we  assumed  that  the  allatonceness  of  a  vast  and  increasing  digital  archive  accessible  anywhere  at  any  time  will  not  affect the way that we learn”  Burdick et al. 2013, 25 . The authors do not  explain or defend their equation of the Internet with memory, but treat it  as self-evident.  In  popular  discourse,  the  perception  of  the  Internet  as  an  automated  archive  circulates  widely  via  truisms  such  as  “The  Internet  remembers  everything.”  Adults  warn  youth  that  they  must  be  circumspect  in  their  speech  and  actions,  since  anything  they  say  or  do  can  be  recorded  and  distributed  online,  reaching  larger  audiences  over  longer  periods  of  time  than any young person probably intends. “The Internet is written in pen”  has become an oft-repeated saying. The notion that the Internet archives  children’s and teens’ foolish antics is reminiscent of a much older type of  threat directed at the young, that all their follies and missteps would be  documented in their “permanent records.” A 2012 Huffington Post article  by  Hemanshu  Nigam,  former  Chief  Security  Officer  of  News  Corp  and  MySpace, employs this exact phrasing: “By our own conduct, we build a  permanent record of everything we do online. Whether we want them to  or not, family, friends, recruiters, employers, enemies and criminals may  easily  access  our  lives  with  a  single  click  of  a  button.  What  might  seem  like a good idea at the time often leads to embarrassment and long-term  personal and professional devastation. The Internet remembers, and that    46   Chapter 1  is a fact that we must remember too”  Nigam 2012 . A host of similar blog  posts and op-eds, warning of the impossibility of erasing documentation of  one’s immature indiscretions from social networks, populate news, parent- ing, and career advice websites.  Warnings  about  the  Internet’s  auto-archival  nature  are  sometimes  couched within scenarios of tragedy, as in the blockbuster action film The  Dark  Knight  Rises   TDKR ,  the  final  installment  of  director  Christopher  Nolan’s trilogy of Batman films. In TDKR, one criminal character, cat bur- glar Selina Kyle, voices her dismay that she cannot “start fresh,” as crime- fighter Batman urges her to do. Selina laments, “There’s no fresh start in  today’s world. Any twelve-year-old with a cell phone could find out what  you did. Everything we do is collated and quantified. Everything sticks.”  In this framing, the Internet-as-memory-machine dramatically undermines  the ability of individuals to continually reinvent themselves, an ability that  is  presented  as  simultaneously  a  freedom  and  an  imperative  in  Western  postmodern,  postindustrial,  neoliberal  society.  Given  that  the  constant  flux of twenty-first-century global capital demands endless flexibility and  unfixity from workers at every economic stratum—capital mines the will- ingness of workers to “start fresh” multiple times over the course of their  lives—it is understandable that parents and educators are deeply concerned  about what they assume to be the Internet’s built-in archival functions, as  a young person’s adaptability, on which their academic and career success  depends, may be thwarted at any moment by the system’s recollection of a  wrong move from their past.  Warnings of the Digital Dark Age  However widely the myth of the automatically archival Internet has spread  over the past seventy years, the fact is that the system of networked com- puting  utterly  fails  as  a  memory  machine.  Professionals  in  the  field  of  library and information sciences  LIS  have issued warnings about digital  data’s tendency to degrade and disappear since the mid-1990s. They have  collectively proclaimed that the Internet and computers do not constitute  the greatest archive in human history, but rather the reverse. The current  historical moment, they argue, may be a “digital dark age,” a time of which  future generations will have scant records, owing to the short lifespans of  our current digital platforms, devices, and applications  as compared to the  lifespans of older technologies, such as paper .  As far as I can determine, the first note of caution about digital decay  was sounded in 1995, when Michael Lesk, a member of the US Task Force    Memory Machine Myth   47  on Archiving of Digital Information,3 gave a talk called “Preserving Digital  Objects: Recurring Needs and Challenges,” at Australia’s Second National  Preservation  Office   NPO   conference  on  Multimedia  Preservation.  Lesk  told a tale of archivists putting their faith into new media that appeared  to be betraying them. The abstract of his presentation reads, “Acid process  wood pulp paper, used in most books since about 1850, … threatened cul- tural memory loss. But digital technology seemed to come to the rescue,  allowing indefinite storage without loss. Now we find that digital informa- tion too, has its dark side”  Lesk 1995 . In other words, Lesk argued, digital  storage media at first appeared to be archivists’ ideal solution to the deg- radation of paper, but then turned out itself to be highly degradable. After  Lesk’s talk came a report by Paul Conway  1996 , then head of the Preserva- tion Department of Yale University Library, which pointed out, “Informa- tion in digital form—the evidence of the world we live in—is more fragile  than the fragments of papyrus found buried with the Pharaohs,” because  “the permanence, durability, and stamina of newer recording media” have  declined steadily over the course of the twentieth century, making the digi- tal age one in which we have “information density” but few options for  permanently  preserving  that  information  and  keeping  it  accessible.  One  year later, in 1997, Terry Kuny appears to have coined the phrase “digital  dark age s ” in a paper presented at the Sixty-third IFLA  International Fed- eration of Library Associations and Institutions  Council and General Con- ference. Kuny  1997  argued that “we are moving into an era where much  of what we know today, much of what is coded and written electronically,  will be lost forever. We are, to my mind, living in the midst of digital Dark  Ages”  1 .  Then, in the late 1990s, voices outside of the LIS professions—from the  mainstream press, the business world, and humanities research—joined in  the chorus cautioning that digital technologies are often antiarchival. In  1998, science and technology journalist James Gleick wrote in a New York  Times Magazine story, “Many of the world’s librarians, archivists, and Inter- net experts are warning that the record of our blooming digital culture is  heading for oblivion, and fast. They note that we have already begun losing  crucial  scientific  data  and  essential  business  records.  …  In  the  electronic  era, we are stockpiling our heritage on millions of floppy disks and hard  drives and CD-ROMs. These flaky objects go obsolete dismayingly fast, with  new technologies rolling in on product cycles as short as two to five years”   Gleick  [1998]  2002,  197 .  In  1999,  Stewart  Brand,  an  early  new  media  entrepreneur who founded the influential Whole Earth magazine, published  an  essay  in  Library  Journal  called  “Escaping  the  Digital  Dark  Age.”  Brand    48   Chapter 1  called for “a long-term strategy for storage,” a remedy to the fact that “there  is still nothing in the digital world like acid-free paper.” Brand quoted an  admonition from Peter Lyman, a librarian at the University of California,  Berkeley: “We know there is a 500-year life to microfilm properly cared for.  But what do we do with digital documents? … We need a digital equivalent  to microfilm, a 500-year solution”  Brand 1999, 46 .  One of the most widely cited critics of the myth of the archival Internet  is Wendy Chun, who dissects Bush’s “As We May Think,” criticizing Bush’s  prognostication that a future technology of networked memory will “make  possible the overarching archive of human knowledge in which there is no  gap, no absence—a summation of human knowledge”  Chun 2008, 159 .  Far from fulfilling Bush’s goal of a perfect archival technology, writes Chun,  “Digital media is not always there. We suffer daily frustration with digital  sources  that  just  disappear.  Digital  media  is  degenerative,  forgetful,  eras- able”  160 .  Chun characterizes networked computer memory as not wholly forget- ful,  but  as  unreliable  and  unpredictable  in  what  it  remembers.  Reconcil- ing  the  “Internet  remembers  everything”  narrative  with  the  digital  dark  age narrative, Chun states, “If things constantly disappear, they also reap- pear, often to the chagrin of those trying to erase data”  Chun 2008, 167 .  The system of networked computing sometimes resurrects un-looked-for,  unwanted information, and often deletes valuable and longed-for informa- tion. Vannevar Bush’s perfect memory machine has never existed.  The Wayback Machine: The Real Memex?  And yet, even in digital dark age discourse, one finds echoes of Bush’s belief  that a combination of the Internet and programmable computers will pro- duce an automated archive. Chun ascribes a kind of ultimate saving power  to a different “machine” than Bush’s memex: the Internet Archive’s Way- back Machine. In 1996, the Internet Archive, an organization I will describe  in more detail in chapter 2, began developing software to crawl and down- load all publicly viewable websites and take “snapshots” of them, in order  to record the websites at different intervals over their life spans. This soft- ware, and the service that stores, preserves, and makes accessible what it  “harvests,” is collectively called the Wayback Machine. Chun writes, “Like  search engines, the Internet Wayback Machine  IWM 4 comprises a slew of  robots and servers that automatically and diligently, and in human terms  obsessively, back up most webpages. … However, unlike search engines, the  IWM does not use this data to render the internet into a library but rather    Memory Machine Myth   49  uses the backups to create what it calls a ‘library of the Internet’”  Chun  2008, 168 . Chun, quoting from the Internet Archive’s website, compares  the Wayback Machine to libraries, and emphasizes the Wayback Machine’s  mission of maintaining digital cultural memory:  The need for cultural memory drives the IWM and libraries more generally. Noting  the loss of early film archives due to the recycling of early film stock, the archivists  state that they are building an “internet library” because “without cultural artifacts,  civilization has no memory and no mechanism to learn from its successes and fail- ures.”  …  The  IWM  is  necessary  because  the  Internet,  which  is  in  so  many  ways  about memory, has, as [Wolfgang] Ernst argues, no memory—at least not without  the intervention of something like the IWM.  Chun 2008, 168–169   It  is  curious  that,  despite  her  opposition  to  Bush’s  idealistic  goal  of  designing a comprehensive memory technology, Chun describes the Way- back  Machine  as  a  mechanism  that  accomplishes  Bush’s  hopes.  The  line  that  she  excerpts  from  the  Internet  Archive’s  website—“without  cultural  artifacts, civilization has no memory and no mechanism to learn from its  successes  and  failures”—reiterates  Bush’s  sentiments  quite  precisely.  The  storage of civilization’s memory in machines that will permit humans to  review their entire collective history and their accumulated knowledge, in  order to plan and execute the best possible future for humanity, is exactly  Bush’s dream for the memex.  Chun acknowledges that the Wayback Machine does not capture every  detail of every webpage that it archives, “because webpages link to, rather  than  embed,  images,  which  can  be  located  anywhere,  and  because  link  locations always change, the IWM preserves only a skeleton of a page, filled  with broken—rendered—links and images”  Chun 2008, 169 . But despite  the  Wayback  Machine’s  imperfect  recall,  Chun  nevertheless  attributes  to  the  Machine  the  same  all-encompassing  archival  power  that  Bush  attri- butes to the memex. Where others regard the Internet as the descendent of  Bush’s memex concept, Chun recognizes the Wayback Machine to be the  only “real” memex, or memex made real  in other words, in Chun’s view,  the  Internet  is  not  the  memex,  as  most  people  think—but  the  Wayback  Machine is a means by which the memex’s aims are accomplished . Posi- tioning the Wayback Machine in relation to the digital dark age discourse  summarized above, Chun writes, “Blind belief in digital memory threatens  to spread [a] lack of memory everywhere and plunge us … into the so-called  digital dark age. The IWM thus fixes the internet by offering us a ‘machine’  that lets us control our movement between past and future by regenerating  the internet on a grand scale”  169 .   50   Chapter 1  I greatly admire the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine and appreciate  that the Machine’s snapshots of websites at different points in time makes  it  possible  for  online  users  to  occasionally  visit  websites  that  have  been  taken down, or to see websites in previous incarnations, even if the “saved”  versions are, as Chun points out, somewhat “lossy”  with missing images,  broken links, etc. . However, I dispute Chun’s idea that the Machine suc- cessfully preserves digital cultural memory in an automated fashion. Both  Bush  and  Chun  fail  to  recognize  that  automated  archival  machines  can  be easily defeated by their own, or other machines’, operational assump- tions.  For  example,  the  Wayback  Machine’s  policies  cause  it  to  delete  its  records of virtually all websites whose original domain owners have ceased  to renew those domain names, which results in losses on a far greater scale  than  Chun  describes.  One  online  fan  fiction  archivist,  whose  fan  pseud- onym is Morgan Dawn  2012  and who was interviewed for my oral his- tory project, explains this particular failing of the Wayback Machine: “Once  you lose your domain ownership—so let’s say ‘Morgan.com,’ I allow it to  lapse. Somebody, usually bulk resellers, will snap it up, and they’ll park a  [new web] page [at that URL]. ‘This domain available for sale.’ They will  always put a robot text [robots.txt] file on that parked page. The Internet  Archive, Wayback Machine, honors robot text files and next time it scans  my—‘my’—former  website,  it  will  see  the  robot  text  and  it  will  retroac- tively remove my entire history. And this has been a problem that’s been  known  since  2007.”  Reinforcing  Morgan  Dawn’s  assessment,  a  blog  post  on  the  Economist  website  in  January  2014  calls  robots.txt  “the  [Internet]  archive’s kryptonite”  Fleischman 2014 . One of the driving questions of  Chun’s  2008  essay is, What leads to “the resuscibility or the undead of  information”   171 ?  The  Wayback  Machine,  though  it  sometimes  proves  very useful for the recovery of “dead” websites, also adheres to policies that  cause sites to be erased from its index, sites that it had previously recorded,  rendering it an untrustworthy archive that will likely become more unreli- able as time goes on, as more domain names expire and more gaps in the  Machine’s “memory” appear.  Fears of a digital dark age are therefore not necessarily opposed to the  myth of an automatically archival Internet. Chun seems to suggest that one  answer to the ephemerality of online data is to automate the periodic saving  of data through some memex-like technology. In other words, Bush’s goal  of making a networked technology into a comprehensive archive may have  failed,  but  other  automatic  archiving  machines,  however  imperfect,  may  succeed in preserving the cultural memory of these early years of the digital  age. A wish for a technological solution to the constant disappearance of    Memory Machine Myth   51  human  knowledge,  culture,  and  experience  lies  at  the  heart  of  both  the  myth of the Internet-as-archive and the dread of a digital dark age.  What is missing from both of these discourses is the figure of the human   archivist.  Techno-Volunteerism  Automated  archival  technologies  acting  alone  have  not,  to  date,  yielded  exceptional results. It is human archivists, working on and with digital tools  and networks, that make digital ephemera endure—when it does endure,  which is not often. Matthew Kirschenbaum writes,  As electronic objects begin to accumulate archival identities  by virtue of the librar- ies, museums, and other cultural repositories increasingly interested in or charged  with  collecting  them ,  it  will  become  essential  to  understand  …  where  the  most  significant challenges of digital preservation finally lie. … Those challenges, while  massively technical to be sure, are also ultimately—and profoundly—social. That is,  … effective preservation must rest in large measure on the cultivation of new social  practices to attend our new media.  Kirschenbaum 2012, 21   Here Kirschenbaum argues that many of the answers to complex questions  about digital preservation lie not in the technical end of archiving, but in  the social aspect—in people. People must work together to preserve “elec- tronic objects”; technology alone will not accomplish it. Nonprofessional  Internet  archivists  have  dedicated  thought,  intent,  and  time  to  develop- ing the “new social practices” of archiving for which Kirschenbaum calls.  At some point in each of their lives, these people decided that what they  wanted to do with their spare time was to construct and maintain Internet  archives  of  cultural  content.  I  call  these  self-designated  digital  archivists  “techno-volunteers.”  I  will  use  the  terms  “techno-volunteers”  and  “techno-volunteerism”  to signal a distinct break from the technological determinist  or “techno- determinist”  thinking that has suffused theories of digital archives from  1945  to  the  present.  Technological  determinism  is  a  school  of  thought  that  emphasizes  the  agency  of  technologies  in  moments  of  sociocultural  change; a simplistic summary of a techno-determinist outlook is, “Shifts in  technology cause shifts in society and culture.” The methodological school  most  often  opposed  to  techno-determinism  is  social  constructivism   or  social construction of technology [SCOT] , which focuses on how humans’  agency and social structures decide what kinds of sociocultural impact spe- cific technologies have; social constructivism’s preferred object of analysis    52   Chapter 1  is “The social shaping of technology,” a framework initially proposed by  Donald MacKenzie and Judy Wajcman  [1985] 1999 . According to this per- spective, “Our technology of production is in many ways the result of our  social relations,” and “technical choices are simultaneously social through  and through”  143 .  New media studies usually frames the beginnings of the techno-deter- minist  vs.  social  constructivism  opposition  as  a  battle  of  ideas  between  Marshall  McLuhan   cited  as  the  preeminent  technological  determinist   and Raymond Williams  as the primary advocate of the social construction  perspective  that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. Narratives about this  debate then point to the 1980s development and launch of actor-network  theory  ANT  by Bruno Latour, Michael Callon, and John Law as a kind of  resolution of the dichotomy, as ANT awards the same possibility for agency  to all actors, or actants—both humans and nonhumans—that combine to  form a sociotechnical system. Nonhuman actants may not have intentions,  as humans do, but they nevertheless “make others do things”  Latour 2005,  107 ; for example, speed bumps cause human drivers to slow their vehicles,  and so must be taken into account as significant players in social action.  In his study of cell phone usage, Gerard Goggin articulates the viewpoint  shared  by  many  new  media  theorists,  that  ANT  offers  a  middle  ground  between  techno-determinism  and  social  constructivism:  Goggin  writes  that ANT revises “formulaic oppositions between technology and society,”  as it refuses to subscribe wholly either to the deterministic position or to  the “countervailing reaction that society determines technology”  Goggin  2006,  11 .  Over  the  past  thirty  years,  ANT  has  usefully  drawn  attention  to “the necessity of a composition of forces to explain [an] action” and has  productively asserted that humans and nonhumans are always co-actants,  with frequent variance as to which actant, and which type of actant, is the  “prime mover” in an action  Latour 1994, 35 .  However,  in  studies  and  theories  of  archival  technologies,  determin- ism has always been a popular stance. Above, I described how Bush, Bush’s  adherent  Nelson,  Bush’s  critic  Chun,  and  numerous  popular  writers  and  texts, have all promoted an idea of the Internet as an automatic archive.  Wolfgang Ernst, outlining his proposal for a method of “media archaeol- ogy,” conceives of recording technologies, beginning with the photographic  camera, as “registering the past coldly, in contrast to painterly animation  and historical imagination”  Ernst 2013, 47 —painting and history writing  being two modes of recording the past that preceded photography. Here  is  another  of  Ernst’s  descriptions  of  photography  as  a  memory  machine:  “With  the  emergence  of  photography,  the  idea  of  the  theatrical  gaze    Memory Machine Myth   53  literally staging the past is displaced by the cold mechanical eye, a tech- nologically  neutral  code  rather  than  a  subjective  discourse”   Ernst  2005,  592 . While photography is a vastly different technology from the Internet,  they are both rendered into devices that record the past in a “mechanical”  and “neutral” way in the discourse of Bush and his successors and in the  discourse of Ernst and media archeologists.  While  human  decision  and  action  are  presumably  necessary  to  acti- vate the memex’s and the photographic camera’s documenting and stor- age  functions,  Ernst  downplays  the  participation  of  the  human  user  to  the point of claiming that photographs are a non-“subjective discourse,”  and Chun frames the Internet “snapshot”-taking system of the Wayback  Machine as non-reliant on human choice or intent, as do Nigam and others  who perceive the Internet as a “permanent record.” Even when Ernst writes  directly about Internet archives, rather than memory technologies such as  photographic cameras, he uses a language of automaticity; for example, dis- cussing “born-digital media art,” Ernst asks, “How does dynamic art archive  itself?”  2013, 82 .  In this book, I will relate the stories of many digital archivists and archive  users to reveal how the old category of “archives” is being renewed in and  through new media, generating new cultural forms and conflicts. By draw- ing heavily on my research team’s interviews with human actants in digital  archival  systems,  I  will  be  employing  a  “theatrical  gaze,”  which  Ernst  is  eager to shunt aside in favor of the “cold gaze” of media archeology  see  Parikka 2013, 8 , in “staging the past” of digital archiving for the reader.  While much valuable work on media technologies has resulted from Ernst’s  cold  gaze,  with  its  attention  to  the  physical  materiality  and  engineered  operability of machines, a theatrical gaze will capture the participation of  human as well as nonhuman actants in the history of Internet archiving.  The efforts of what I call techno-volunteers have been so crucial to online  archiving that to ignore or marginalize this labor would be to completely  misperceive what it means, and what it takes, to “save” the Internet.  Repertoires of Digital Archiving  To say that I advocate techno-volunteerism over techno-determinism as a  lens for understanding digital memory means that I wish to emphasize that  Internet culture is best preserved by self-designated archivists who perform  the labor required to create and sustain online archives, rather than by any  built-in functionalities of the network or by any software system.   54   Chapter 1  I argue that techno-volunteers have managed to archive online cultural  production through developing archival repertoires, that is, through prac- tices and ways of doing that are passed from person to person. “Repertoire”  is a mode of memory that, as Diana Taylor  2003  points out, is often held  to be the antithesis of the memory mode of “archive”  19–22 . “Repertoire”  transmits knowledge through processes of embodied mimesis, one person  imitating what another person does, while “archive” transmits knowledge  through  recording  technologies,  such  as  handwriting,  printing,  sound  records, photographs, film, and so on, one person decoding the knowledge  that another person has encoded in fixed form. But Taylor resists the notion  that the two modes of transmission form a dichotomy, and points out that  archive and repertoire frequently cooperate or operate simultaneously.  I  argue  that  techno-volunteers  have  developed  ways  and  means  of  archiving the Internet that form the backbone of digital cultural memory.  Without these practices, few, if any, digital archives would be in existence.  Thus, if the Internet is ever usable as archive, it is made so by repertoire.  Internet  archiving  depends  on  techno-volunteers’  archival  repertoires.  Thus, it cannot be said that print culture’s elevation of archive as a superior  memory mode has persisted, unchallenged, into the twenty-first century, as  digital culture has become more prevalent. Techniques of repertoire have,  so far, mattered at least as much as the technics of archives in the preserva- tion of digital networked culture.  Archiving  with  digital  technologies  requires  human  enactment  of  the  archivist’s  repertoire.   Also,  digital  archives  require  a  great  deal  of  non- repertoire-based performance: online archiving has been so experimental  throughout its first few decades that it often demands creative improvisa- tion, and archivists sometimes wish they had more of a repertoire to rely  on.  Print culture opposed archive to repertoire and assigned very different  values to them; it placed archival modes in a privileged position over reper- toire, linking notions of objectivity, facticity, fixity, whiteness, and moder- nity to archive, while relegating repertoire to the lesser position, associating  repertoire  with  unreliability,  subjectivity,  fluidity,  non-whiteness,  and  ancientness or “tradition.” In the digital era, repertoire factors so heavily  in the making and sustaining of digital archives that its inextricability from  the archival mode, and its significance in processes of cultural preservation,  cannot be contested.  One might say that print and analog media archives were, and still are,  just as dependent on repertoire as digital archives. After all, human archi- vists have always been necessary for the archiving of cultural materials—a  major  objective  of  LIS  education  programs  is  to  transmit  the  repertoires    Memory Machine Myth   55  of archival labor required by traditional memory institutions to successive  generations of workers. But the elaborate repertoires and rituals of librar- ians  and  archivists  have  tended  to  remain  what  Erving  Goffman   [1956]  1959  would call “backstage” at memory institutions. Digital archives, in  contrast, have foregrounded archival repertoires, for three major reasons.  First,  because  the  first  generation  of  Internet  archivists  have  brought  these repertoires into existence, their practices and ways-of-doing are more  evident to users than the regularized, professionalized practices of LIS work- ers at traditional archives and libraries. Even if digital archive users do not  “see” the vast majority of the work performed by archivists, users do see the  differences between various archivists’ methods, the upgrades and altera- tions that archivists make to their sites, and the moments when archives  break  for example, when archives lose massive amounts of data  or suc- ceed  for example, when archives experience large influxes of new content  or recover data that was presumed lost —in other words, the irregularities  and lack of standardization between digital archives at this time, when the  entire  genre  of  online  archives  is  still  so  young,  announce  the  fact  that  humans are driving these archives, and those humans are still in the pro- cess of inventing and refining the repertoires of digital archival work.  Second, archivists often do a great deal of what Goffman  [1956] 1959   would call “front stage” work, representing their archives to the public and  interfacing directly with users, and in general serving as the “face”  or, at  least, the name and email address  of their archives. However, oftentimes  only one archivist—the lead or founding archivist—is the primary contact  for the archive’s users; in many cases, a team of workers is required to sup- port an Internet archive, and this support staff’s work often is invisible to  the public. Also, even if users know who the archivists of a given repository  are, and frequently communicate with them, they may know nothing of,  or severely underestimate, the type and quantity of labor that the archivists  put into keeping their archives up to date and their interfaces easy to use. The third reason that archival repertoires are more prominent in digi- tal archiving than in print and analog archiving is the tendency of digital  archives to fail. As I have been emphasizing, building on Chun’s “enduring  ephemeral” argument, digital data is so prone to disappearance that con- stant intervention is required to refresh data storage and keep it retrievable.  At the least, data must be migrated to new servers when old servers cease  to function optimally. Also, the rental costs of server rack space must be  paid,  ownership  of  website  URLs  must  be  renewed,  sites  should  be  mir- rored   redundancy  is  one  of  the  best  methods  for  staving  off  accidental  data disappearance , and when a lead archivist decides to quit her archival    56   Chapter 1  responsibilities,  she  should  recruit  her  replacement s   and  oversee  the  smooth transition of the archive into new hands. If librarians had to not  only enter books into their records and put them on the shelves of a library,  but also had to move the entire library to a new building every few years,  and  also  had  to  pay  the  rent  and  other  fees  associated  with  having  the  library building in the first place, and also had to make sure that for every  single book in the library, a copy existed in another library with which they  were in direct contact, and if librarians had to personally designate their  replacement before resigning their post, or else risk the closure of the entire  library, then both librarians and the library-going public would be far more  conscious  of  how  much  repeated  human  labor  and  intervention—which  I  am  calling  archival  repertoire—goes  into  the  maintenance  of  a  library.   Of course, the type of migration and mirroring labor that I am describing  would be far more physically taxing, and would require much more time  and  many  more  financial  resources,  for  employees  at  a  brick-and-mortar  library than it is for digital archivists, but digital archivists must still devote  significant volumes of energy, time, and money to their repositories—just  because the digital archive’s repertoire is physically easier, and cheaper, to  enact  than  the  built-library  repertoire  does  not  mean  that  it  isn’t  work.   Users of Internet archives know that archivists are needed to make those  archives operational—if only when the archivist goes on a vacation, gets  too busy with his or her “real” job or personal life to actively maintain the  archive, or leaves the archive altogether because it becomes too much of a  drain on his or her personal resources. The day that an online archive dies,  or goes dark  that is, becomes inaccessible to the public , is the day when  an archivist ceases to enact the repertoire, and this is usually the day when  the user base becomes painfully aware of the repertoire’s existence, and the  necessity of the repertoire’s repeated performance.  Repertoires and Scripts in New Media Studies  I am not the first to borrow the term “repertoire” from performance theory  and apply it to new media phenomena. The field of digital design studies  has thoroughly incorporated “repertoire” into its vocabulary, often using  it to refer to the sum of practices and ways-of-doing that designers employ  in  their  work   for  example:  “A  rich  repertoire  of  templates  and  a  devel- oped  language  for  design  qualities  are  two  essential  components  of  pro- fessional design ability” [Löwgren and Stolterman 1998]; “A repertoire of  practice refers to the sum of available tools, techniques, strategies, tactics,  ways of working, expertise and know-how from which a practitioner may    Memory Machine Myth   57  draw, choose from, and or combine to suit both known and novel situa- tions  or  address  a  particular  purpose”  [Burrows  and  Morgan  2010] .  This  translation of design activity as “repertoire” has been especially useful for  design pedagogy, as instructors can encourage students to build their reper- toires by demonstrating their own “repertoires of practice” or “repertoires  of experience.”  For instance, the abstract for a paper by design educators  Philippe Saliou and Vincent Ribaud [2004] reads, “Performing good design  is a difficult task. To take up this challenge, practitioners rely on their reper- toire of experience. Students, however, do not have any such repertoire. We  propose an approach aimed at bootstrapping the repertoire.”   However, a richer use of “repertoire” in design studies can be found in  Erling Björgvinsson, Pelle Ehn, and Per-Anders Hillgren’s 2012 essay “Ago- nistic Participatory Design.” Björgvinsson, Ehn, and Hillgren write about  the struggles that often arise among participants in an emerging system,  and  stress  the  importance  of  the  designer’s  leadership  in  negotiating  the  various  demands  placed  upon  the  system:  “The  design  researcher  role  becomes one of infrastructuring agonistic public spaces mainly by facilitat- ing the careful building of arenas consisting of heterogeneous participants,  legitimizing those marginalized, maintaining network constellations, and  leaving behind repertoires of how to organize socio-materially when con- ducting  transformative  innovations”   Björgvinsson,  Ehn,  and  Hillgren  2012, 143 . Substituting “digital archivist” for “design researcher” in this  formulation enables me to surface a number of core components of digital  archival labor:     The digital archivist engages in infrastructure building, or infrastructuring.5    The archivist infrastructures public spaces that are often “agonistic,” that  is, engaged in conflict  see Mouffe’s [2000] argument in The Democratic Par- adox that “agonistic pluralism” is a better model for democratic interaction  and action than consensus building .    A large part of the archivist’s task in building these spaces is moderating  the  conflicts  that  arise,  such  that  “marginalized”  opinions  are  registered  and taken into account and the “network constellation” made up of “het- erogeneous participants” remains operational despite the heterogeneity.    Therefore, the archivist works from a repertoire, a repertoire of how to  organize a system socially and materially  that is, technically , a repertoire  of how to bring new digital archives into being, how to grow them, and  how to sustain them.  The repertoire of digital archiving, from this perspective, consists at least  as  much  of  managing  human  relations,  including  arbitrating  majority    58   Chapter 1  minority  disagreements,  as  it  does  of  providing  technical  services.  As  an  Internet archivist succeeds in enlarging the public space  the archive  she  has  constructed,  and  in  dealing  with  the  space  in  a  way  that  honors  its  “agonistic  pluralism”  on  a  continuing  basis,  the  archivist  not  only  adds   to  her  own,  individual  repertoire  of  how-to-do-digital-archiving,  but   potentially to other Internet archivists’ repertoires as well: like design stu- dents, digital archivists learn from observing one another’s repertoires of  practice.  Design  studies’  application  of  “repertoire”  to  infrastructuring—the  notion that infrastructuring emerges from, and enhances, a designer’s  or  archivist’s  repertoire, and that it involves negotiating between people as  well  as  solving  technological  problems—reinforces  my  perspective  that  the growing phenomenon of digital archiving is better understood when  viewed  through  the  lens  of  techno-volunteerism  rather  than  the  lens  of  techno-determinism. Techno-volunteerism emphasizes the role of human  actants in the creation of systems that preserve digital content and Internet  content. Archivists are, as I have argued, incredibly important actants in  the building of online archives, and their repertoires must include not only  technical skills but techniques for receiving and processing users’ feedback  in the form of demands, complaints, requests, and compliments. In addi- tion, this ongoing dialogue between designers archivists and archive users  illustrates  that  users  of  online  archives  are  themselves  techno-volunteers  whose interactions with online archives help to shape them.  The recognition that users contribute to the design of platforms has been  fostered by the subfield of design studies called “Participatory Design” and  has also been productively discussed as “collaborative media” by Jonas Löw- gren and Bo Reimer in their 2013 book by that title. Löwgren and Reimer   2013   attempt  to  put  to  rest  the  question  of  technological  determinism  versus social constructivism by asserting, “People using collaborative media  products and services—people who produce media texts with the help of  the  products  and  services  and  people  who  consume  texts—continuously  take part … in the design process”  148 . In other words, the “uses” of a  technology are never inherent in that technology, and are never completely  fixed in place by the designers of that technology, but arise, over time, from  interactions between the technology itself, its original designers, and the  users who become its codesigners over time. Löwgren and Reimer point to  another appropriation of performance language by new media studies—the  concept of “scripts”—to make their point that “The designer [is] one actor  in a large participatory process, not the actor”  144 . Löwgren and Reimer  cite  ANT  theorist  Madeleine  Akrich’s  argument  that,  “like  a  film  script,    Memory Machine Myth   59  technical objects define a framework of action together with the actors and  the space in which they are supposed to act”  208 . Akrich does not mean  to imply that the “script” that technical objects give to actors wholly deter- mines the performance of the actors with those technologies; like actors in  a  stage  or  media  production,  there  is  “incessant  variation”  between  “the  designer’s projected user and the real user,” and “the user’s reactions … give  body to the designer’s project”  209 .  Affordances Need Performances  What Akrich describes as a “script” written into a technology’s workings  and  interface,  most  designers  would  call  a  set  of  “affordances.”  Löwgren  and  Reimer  credit  Donald  Norman  for  importing  the  term  “affordance”  into the field of interaction design in 1988, “as a way to understand what  it is in a thing that makes it interesting or relevant for a potential user”   Löwgren  and  Reimer  2013,  25 .  Yochai  Benkler   2006   lauds  designers’,  engineers’, and STS  science and technology  scholars’ enthusiastic adop- tion of “affordances,” as Benkler argues that the concept allows technology  theorists to move away from “a naïve [technological] determinism.” Ben- kler writes, “Different technologies make different kinds of human action  and interaction easier or harder to perform. … Neither deterministic nor  wholly malleable, technology sets some parameters of individual and social  action. It can make some actions, relationships, organizations, and institu- tions easier to pursue, and others harder”  17 .  But  it  is  possible  to  move  even  more  definitively  away  from  techno- determinism  than  Akrich  and  Benkler  do.  Rather  than  being  concerned  with  what  is  “in”  a  technology  that  makes  human  action interaction  “easier or harder to perform,” we can emphasize that affordances need per- formances.  Affordances  for  archiving  may  inhere  in  networked  comput- ing—Bush insisted that computing have the potential for vast information  storage and retrieval in “As We May Think,” and his essay influenced sub- sequent hardware and interface designers to develop this potentiality—but  archival affordances do not bring archives into being. They may make build- ing archives “easier to pursue,” as Benkler would say, but as this book will  detail, the building and  especially  the maintaining of digital archives is  not at all easily done; little is easy about the task of online cultural preser- vation. Technologies’ affordances, or “scripts,” may suggest uses for those  technologies, but it is the human actor—let us replace “actant” with the  older  and  more  suggestive  term  “actor”  here—who  must  perform  those  scripts, and it is the human body that “gives body,” as Akrich says, to the    60   Chapter 1  potential  inherent  in  a  technological  system.  The  human  actor’s  perfor- mance—the  mind’s  decisions  and  the  body’s  actions—actualizes  what  is  virtual  in  machines   their  possibilities,  their  theoretical  capacities ,  and  because volunteerism—human will—is involved, the actuality never maps  directly onto the virtuality. That is, there is never a precise, one-to-one cor- respondence between a technology’s virtual aspects, encoded by its design- ers, and the technology’s actual functioning, as performed by users.  A script is never, and can never be, performed exactly as intended, even  if  the  intentions  of  the  “authors”  are  incredibly  clear   which  is  hardly  ever the case . Rather, a script is always brought to life by, in, and through  human performance differently than the script’s writers can predict. In fact,  like  every  script,  technologies’  scripts  are  performed  differently  by  every  human  actor  every  time  a  performance  takes  place.  The  laws  of  perfor- mance  different-with-every-actor, different-every-time, even if there is an  underlying resemblance or repetition between iterations as every actor who  engages with a specific technology works with the same “script”  trump the  theory of technological determinism, in the case of digital archiving and in  the case of much technological use.  Concepts and terms of performance, as employed in design studies’ and  ANT’s  theories  of  technological  development,  thus  highlight  the  funda- mental parts that people play in creating infrastructures of digital cultural  memory. “Performance” connotes modes of transmission that are not fixed   as are text and recorded media , but are processual and evolving, that are  repetitious but are also unique in each instance—and so is an apt descrip- tor for how digital archiving currently occurs. “Performance” implies that  human actors must embody and execute scripted functions—and so is use- ful  as  a  metaphor  for  the  necessary  collaborations  between  humans  and  nonhumans  that  produce  digital  archival  infrastructures.  The  readiness  with which some branches of new media studies are appropriating the lan- guage of performance indicates an opportunity for performance studies to  assert  its  centrality  in  the  digital  age.  But  it  also  challenges  performance  scholars to decouple performance from liveness and physical presence, and  to turn their theoretical attention to the forms of repertoire and enactment  that are arising in and through new media, forms that do not depend on  face-to-face, real-world contact.  Although many have dreamed that computing machines could be built  to  house  and  preserve  human  knowledge,  or  have  assumed   hopefully  or  anxiously   that  the  Internet  and  networked  computing  systems  auto- matically save what users publish online, Vannevar Bush’s ultimate mem- ory  machine  is  still  a  myth.  The  digital  archives  that  techno-volunteers    Memory Machine Myth   61  construct,  drawing  on  their  repertoires  of  practice  and  experience,  and  building on those repertoires as they learn to negotiate the divergent needs  and desires of their users and to navigate constant server-side and coding  challenges, are currently the only persistent, reliable forms of digital cul- tural memory. These archives are only as persistent and as reliable as the  humans who make them. Even so, they are, so far, more dependable than  machines.    Break 1  Canon and Repertoire Break  and  Canon   1 Repertoire  The Breakdown and Multiplication of “Canon”  My initial concept for chapter 2 was that it should contain a list and descrip- tion of some “canonical” digital archives, in order to give the reader a better  understanding of the practice of rogue archiving that is this book’s subject.  But what would it mean to propose a “canon” of such archives? The rise of  digital culture has thrown the very concepts of canon, canonization, and  canonicity into radical question. I must investigate how networked com- puting forces a rethinking of “canon” before risking any new deployment  of the term.  I  will  first  briefly  recapitulate  for  the  reader  the  fact  that  the  idea  of  a  cultural  canon  came  under  fire  long  before  the  advent  of  widespread,  everyday digital culture in the 1990s. Starting in the late 1950s and for sev- eral decades following, postmodern theorists and artists, including Susan  Sontag, Andreas Huyssen, Andy Warhol, and Frederic Jameson,1 questioned  the  utility  of  canonization,  of  a  distinction  between  “high”  culture  and  “low” culture; they argued that the conferral of elite status on once-shock- ing and avant-garde works—such as the modernist output of Pablo Picasso,  Gertrude Stein, Virginia Woolf, Igor Stravinsky, and others—seemed only  to dull the works’ oppositionality and transform them into what Jameson   1984   deemed  “a  set  of  dead  classics”   56 .  Postmodernists  called  for  a  collapsing of high and low categories, or an incorporation of the “pop,”  “mass,” and “commercial” into the cultural canon.  Over  the  same  period  of  time,  from  roughly  the  1960s  through  the  1990s, the “canon wars” raged on US university campuses, fought between  traditionalists who sought to identify and defend a core curriculum—“the  ‘basic’ things an educated person should know, … knowledge [that] devel- ops the informed citizenry a democracy needs to thrive”—and reformists,  who expressed “increasing discomfort with inherited curricula, … seen as    64   Break 1  constrained  by  issues  of  race,  class,  gender,  and  first-world  biases  rooted  in Eurocentric traditions,” write Anne Burdick et al.  2013, 23  in Digital  Humanities.2 “The wars over the core,” as Burdick et al. call these conflicts  in the humanities, multiplied the number and types of cultural canons rec- ognized as legitimate on college campuses, as faculty and students formed  new  curricula,  programs,  and  research  agendas  in  ethnic  studies,  gender  and women’s studies, disability studies, and other previously ignored and  marginalized areas.  But Burdick et al. claim that the most dramatic shift in humanistic study  effectuated by the canon wars was not the proliferation of different canons   or canons of difference , but the elimination, or extreme diminishment, of  “the very idea of sharing common references or approaches.” The authors  write  that  “the  perspective  of  …  once-excluded  materials,”  incorporated  into  humanities-oriented  scholarship  over  the  course  of  the  canon  wars,  “carried with them alternative methodologies and different value systems  that  shattered  any  illusion  of  a  single  belief  system  within  humanistic  thought”   Burdick  et  al.  2013,  23 ,  and  so  the  very  notion  of  canonicity  itself, the thought that there should be any center of study that would be  recognized as such by a group of scholars, faded.  Burdick et al.  2013  make the case that the clearing away of canonic- ity has opened the possibility for a new “generative humanities” to arise,  one that combines traditional forms of scholarly analysis with “computa- tional capacity”  5 , and that will depend on, among other methodologies,  “enhanced critical curation”  32–34 . The authors argue that the digital era  calls for heightened emphasis on curation, which they define as the indi- vidual scholar’s ability “to filter, organize, craft, and, ultimately, care for a  story composed out of—even rescued from—the infinite array of potential  tales, relics, and voices” being made available via digital collections  34 .  “In the Digital Humanities, curation refers to a wide range of practices of  organizing and re-presenting the cultural record of humankind in order to  create value, impact, and quality”  34 , they write. The authors argue, in  other words, that scholars will never again be able to agree on a “canon,”  because they now have too much “archive.” At best, individuals or teams  will decide on selection strategies that they will apply to the panoply of  digital  archives  at  their  disposal,  and  form  their  own  curated  collections  of content, rather than attempting to establish a cultural canon based on  broad consensus.  But then, given the potentially overwhelming preponderance of online  archives hinted at by Burdick et al., can or should there be a “canon of digital  archives” upon which humanities scholars agree, which presumably many    Canon and Repertoire   65  scholars would utilize as their sources for primary documents? Surely, such  a  canon  would  include  large  electronic  repositories  that  can  be  accessed  through  subscribing  memory  institutions   school  and  university  librar- ies,  for  instance ,  such  as  JSTOR,  Artstor,  and  EEBO   Early  English  Books  Online ; archives assembled by, or in close cooperation with, memory and  heritage organizations, such as Europeana and all of the online portals of  museums and libraries that offer access to content; and for-profit archives  such as Getty Images. But what about archives that exist separately from  the organizational structures that dominated the print era: governments,  museums, libraries, universities, and corporations? What about born-digital  archives  founded,  operated,  and  most  often  funded,  by  volunteers ama- teurs hackers pirates fans?  It  is  widely  accepted  that  if  certain  brick-and- mortar institutions have cultural legitimacy, such as the Library of Congress  or the Musée du Louvre, then their online archives carry the same legiti- macy. Can “rogue” digital archives attain the same legitimacy—can they be  “canonized”?  My answer is no. I argue that the new media have ushered a new archival  system into being, one that has little to do with print culture’s definitions  of “archive.” Rogue digital archives cannot be canonized, but they do mani- fest archival styles, or archival repertoires, that can.  Canon Repertoire and Archive  A  cultural  canon  is  usually  thought  of  in  relation  to  a  cultural  archive.  The  title  of  Aleida  Assmann’s  essay,  “Canon  and  Archive,”  in  Astrid  Erll  and Ansgar Nünning’s anthology Media and Cultural Memory  2008 , pre- pares the reader for a repetition of the truism that a canon is an archive in  certain  respects,  in  that  whatever  literary  texts  or  audiovisual  works  one  could point to as canonical within a given culture constitutes a conceptual  archive of what nineteenth-century cultural critic Matthew Arnold  2009   would call “the best which has been thought and said in the world”  5 ,  at least as perceived by members of that culture. What is canonical there- fore is, de facto, what is “archived” by the culture and society; canonical  works are preserved, both virtually  theoretically everyone knows them and  remembers them  and literally  they are conserved in repositories and kept  safe from material degradation, as much as possible .  But  A.  Assmann’s  essay  argues  for  a  new  relation  between  canon  and  archive. Rather than drawing an equivalence between canon and archive,  A.  Assmann   2008   aligns  canon  with  repertoire,  and  defines  archive  as  quite different from both of those terms. She explains that active or working    66   Break 1  cultural memory differs from passive cultural memory. “The institutions of  active memory preserve the past as present while the institutions of passive  memory  preserve  the  past  as  past,”  she  writes   98 .  She  makes  clear  that  working memory transpires through repeated performances of the canon—she  gives  the  example  of  “works  of  art,  which  are  destined  to  be  repeatedly  re-read, appreciated, staged, performed, and commented [on]”  99 —while  the  archives,  the  institutions  of  passive  memory,  hold  cultural  materials  that  are  “relicts”   sic,  99 ,  that  are  inert,  that  await  “new  contexts”  and  “new interpretations” by future scholars and artists who may discover them   99 . I extrapolate from A. Assmann, though she may not go so far as to put  it this way, that a culture’s canon is defined by a culture’s repertoire. That is,  whatever texts a culture continually reperforms, restages, comments upon,  rereads, and so on—whatever is reembodied by the individuals of that cul- ture, over time—comprises that culture’s canon. When a work drops out of  the repertoire, then, and fails to be restaged and reperformed and reread for  a generation or longer, one calls it a “forgotten” work. Such a work exits  the canon and enters the archive. Also, texts can also move from the unper- formed archive into the performed canon. Canon = texts + performance.  Archived texts sit unaccessed most of the time, unread most of the time,  unperformed most of the time.  For  digital  culture,  the  conflation  of  canon  with  repertoire  holds  two  interesting ramifications. First, digital archives potentially redefine what A.  Assmann calls “active memory” and “passive memory,” in the sense that  these become highly individualized: all materials contained in an online  database  are  equally  available  to  the  user—no  materials  are  any  more  “hidden” or “stored away” than any other materials, all materials that are  indexed can be retrieved from the database—and so users of an Internet  archive may “activate” whichever of the materials they wish, constructing  their own personal canons based on the materials that they use. In other  words, if repertoire is canon, then whatever a user finds in an archive and  chooses to use is a canonical work, for that person. Digital archives erect  no physical barriers between categories of information, so conceivably any  piece of information, any archived data, can enter into one person’s rep- ertoire  and  canon;  thus,  there  are  as  many  possible  canons  as  there  are  archive users, and no possibility for a single canon, achieved by a consensus  of cultural archive users, that would be distinct from the culture’s archive.  For each person, of course, “canon” and “archive” would still be separate,  though what texts enter a person’s repertoire at any given period, and what  texts lie unused in the archive, may change frequently. But for the culture  at large, the notion of a shared canon becomes tenuous at best when digital    Canon and Repertoire   67  databases store much of the cultural memory. This idea that digital archives  assist  and  manifest  the  predigital  trend  of  infinite-canons,  meaning  no- canon, dovetails with the ideas of the Digital Humanities authors, described  above.  A. Assmann  2008  writes, “Although we cannot imagine a culture with- out  an  active  cultural  memory,  we  can  well  imagine  a  culture  without  a  passive  storing  memory”   105 .  When  A.  Assmann  writes  of  “active  cul- ture memory” without “passive storing memory” here, she is referencing  “oral  cultures  in  which  the  cultural  memory  is  embodied  and  transmit- ted through performances and practices,” in which “material relics do not  persist and accumulate,” and in which “the range of the cultural memory  is  coextensive  with  the  embodied  repertoires  that  are  performed  in  fes- tive rites and repeated practices”  105 . She cites Diana Taylor’s works on  “indigenous embodied practice as a form of knowing as well as a system for  storing and transmitting knowledge”  Taylor 2003, 18 . But even though  A.  Assmann  is  discussing  “indigenous”  and  “oral”  cultures  such  as  those  whose culture is now defined by UNESCO as “intangible cultural heritage”   A. Assmann 2008, 105 , I think that her definition of “a culture without a  passive storing memory” well describes digital culture.  This  is  not  because  there  is  no  such  thing  as  “archive”  anymore,  but  because of the flatness of digital databases—the fact that any item can be  retrieved from a database with equal ease, without architectural or status  barriers separating certain categories of information from others  at least,  this is the case for rogue digital archives —any individual user of an archive  may incorporate any content from that archive into their working memory,  or canon, rather than leaving it untouched. In other words, when digital  archives form the substrate of cultural memory, the literature, music, film,  video, and static art that fill up one person’s passive cultural memory  in  essence, being forgotten, or unused, by that person  may be the very texts  that another person actively engages with, constituting that person’s work- ing cultural memory. So one can say that digital culture has no “passive  storing memory,” because that passive memory differs for each individual.  The culture as a whole cannot clearly define what lies fallow as “archive,”  as opposed to what is activated, living, in “repertoire,” or “canonical,” for  every member of that culture.  Digital Doing  At  the  same  time  that  digital  cultural  memory  collapses  broadly  appli- cable  demarcations  between  passive  memory  and  working  memory,  the    68   Break 1  possibility for a new kind of canon and repertoire arises with new media:  the  canon  of  digital  doing,  the  repertoire  of  computer  use,  the  routines  and rituals of human performances of technological affordances. Over the  past quarter-century or so, since the 1991 launch of the World Wide Web  and the subsequent explosion in everyday computer use, millions of peo- ple have collectively developed vast repertoires for interfacing with digital  devices and networks, exploiting the affordances built into technologies by  their makers.   What might be considered the core digital repertoire was invented by  Doug Engelbart and his team at the Stanford Research Institute  SRI ’s Aug- mentation Research Center in the 1960s, and presented to the public by  Engelbart at the Fall Joint Computer Conference  FJCC  in San Francisco  in  December  1968.  This  presentation  is  popularly  known  today  as  “The  Mother of All Demos”  Internet Archive 2010 , as it introduced a window- ing system, the mouse, hypertext, word processing, dynamic file linking,  and other elements of computing that are now taken utterly for granted,  so  fundamental  are  they  to  contemporary  hardware  and  software.  The  repertoire  that  Engelbart  demoed  in  1968,  which  all  users  have  by  now  adopted, includes: scrolling and pointing with a mouse, clicking to select  and open files, creating files and storing them in folders, opening multiple  windows on the desktop, inserting hyperlinks that connect two files. On  top  of  that  core  repertoire,  users  have  built  up  twenty-five  years’  worth  of bodily actions, performed mainly by fingers, thumbs, wrists, eyes, and  heads,  such  as:  dragging-and-dropping,  cutting-and-pasting copying-and- pasting, scrolling up and down, and swiping left and right.  These  actions  may  seem  thoroughly  determined  by  the  affordances  built into networked computing by designers and programmers, with little  room  left  for  users’  interpretations.  But  other  types  of  actions  routinely  performed by computer users are less “scripted.” The use of certain acro- nyms  IMO for “In my opinion,” ITA for “I totally agree,” YMMV for “Your  mileage may vary” ; the use of the pound sign    to denote a “hashtag” or  “tag” by which online posts can be marked as belonging to a specific group,  topic, or theme;3 the use of one pseudonym, or only a handful of pseuds, as  one’s login or username on multiple sites; the use of email and Web-based  platforms  such as blogs, journals, and social media sites  not only to com- municate  one’s  own  thoughts  and  emotions,  but  to  share  content  made  by  others   jokes,  videos,  image  macros,  GIFs ,  often  as  an  expression  of  oneself—these often-repeated actions were not dictated by the affordances  inherent in hardware, software, or networks, but came to be widely agreed  upon  conventions  through  human  users’  actions.  The  repetition  of  such    Canon and Repertoire   69  actions is not consciously willed by each user; rather, a collective memory  of digital use, of what kinds of performances are typical and acceptable and  effective, has been transmitted from user to user, and not through written  handbooks—so that users simply know what to do when they begin to use  a digital device, they remember, in their bodies, how to perform with their  machines. They have a working memory of what to do, when, and how,  when they wish to engage with other people remotely, via telecommunica- tions networks.  This collective memory of digital use is a digital repertoire because no  one reads a manual when they first begin using networked computers to  figure out how to be a user. Even when a user tries to build her competency  with  a  new  piece  of  software,  or  a  game,  or  a  social  site,  on  the  whole,  she will find simple observation of an experienced user engaging with the  platform, or a video demonstration of someone performing in that digital  environment, more helpful than reading an instruction set.  One could argue that a video demo is an archival format, but I claim that  demo instruction is, in fact, a transmission of repertoire: a showing-doing.  The learner of the repertoire learns by watching-doing, and then the learner  does the actions that they have observed. One can show-doing and watch- doing  on  a  screen  as  well  as  in  physical  space.   In  fact,  for  the  showing- doing and watching-doing of screen-based actions, a video recording that  fills the frame with the screen activity may be more efficient than sitting  beside someone and watching her manipulate the keyboard, although the  ability to ask questions of the more experienced user “in person” has its  own  advantages.   One  often,  in  fact,  reverse-engineers  the  “doing,”  sim- ply  by  noting  how  others  comport  themselves  in  networked  spaces   for  example, noticing that people append tag lines to their mobile phone and  tablet messages, apologizing for any spelling or grammatical errors made  because they are typing on a handheld device, may lead a user to append a  similar tag line to his outgoing messages . There are, of course, many highly  individualized  repertoires,  as  each  user  has  her  preferences  for  arranging  windows on her desktop, opening browser tabs in a certain order when she  first “gets online” in the morning, using specific hotkeys to execute specific  functions, and so on. But there is a growing shared digital repertoire also,  one that current and future generations learn by observing others’ doings. Canon,  as  A.  Assmann   2008   would  say,  is  the  content  of  a  culture’s  repertoire  because  what  is  canonical  is  constantly  reperformed,  reused,  restaged, reenacted. What is “in” the canon is shared through repertoire;  the cultural canon is “done” again and again and again. Digital culture has  built up a robust array of canonical movements and maneuvers, performed    70   Break 1  over and over again by individual bodies, and these canonical actions con- stitute the current digital repertoire. The widespread adoption of new cate- gories of devices—motion sensor gaming consoles such as Kinect, wearable  computers like the Apple Watch, virtual reality masks such as Oculus Rift,  3D printers, nanotechnology implants—will lead to the formation of new  canonical moves and the incorporation of those moves into the digital rep- ertoire. While there may also be a great deal of archival material about how  to use computers and the Internet—how-to guides and lists of steps to take  while  working  with  various  applications—these  are  not  in  the  “working  memory” of the current digital culture, but remain in the “passive mem- ory,” consulted only on occasion.  Print culture, too, has its repertoires  sitting in a chair to read a book,  inserting  bookmarks  at  stopping  points  in  one’s  reading,  conventions  of  correspondence,  and  so  on .  But  where  print  culture  privileged  archi- val memory over embodied memory—for example, through large capital  investments made in archival institutions such as museums and libraries— digital culture elevates repertoire. In three hundred years’ time, owing to  the high propensity of digital data to decay and disappear  as I described  in  chapter  1 ,  it  is  uncertain  whether  any  digital  artifacts  produced  over  the past twenty-five years will remain; but it is very likely that much of the  current digital repertoire will still be in use, albeit modified to adapt to new  device types.  Just  as  the  contents  of  most  telephone  conversations  have  not  been  archived but the repertoire of conversing via telephone has persisted into  the digital age, so too may much digital content be deleted over time even  as digital repertoires endure. For example, not a single image macro from  the 2000s may be retrievable in 2300—entire genres such as LOLcats and  Ryan Gosling “Hey Girl” variants may vanish—but users will still engage  in the practice of overlaying silly or adorable or remarkable pictures with  humorous  text  and  distributing  the  resulting  visual  assemblages  online.  Even if all the media texts distributed via the BitTorrent protocol are lost,  and the BitTorrent protocol also falls into disuse, peer-to-peer file-sharing  will still take place. If all of the documents released to the public by Wikile- aks are forgotten, the techniques for leaking classified information by way  of networked systems will be remembered, though updated and, probably,  highly refined over the next few hundred years. Wikipedia may fold, but  online crowdsourced encyclopedias will still be built.  While  it  may  appear  that  new  media  have  given  rise  to  a  preponder- ance of archives, it is really repertoire that is rising in the digital age. Dig- ital  archives  must  be  labored  on  to  survive,  and  who  knows  how  many    Canon and Repertoire   71  generations of labor each archive will attract? Every Internet archive that  has opened may close down within three hundred years; the repertoires for  digital archiving that are coalescing today will remain in play.  Repertoires of Archiving  I  predict  that  many  digital  repertoires  will  outlast  most  digital  archives.  And thus, chapter 2, which I had originally intended to suggest a possible  canon of digital archives, will offer instead a description of three canonical  styles of digital archiving that I perceive as dominant. Because there can no  longer be a single, consensus-based cultural canon for all of the reasons,  and after all of the historical movements, described above, and because the  coincidence of canon with repertoire is even clearer in digital culture than  it was in print culture, I can only point to repertoires of archiving, rather  than archives that contain canonical works or canonical archives.  The  definitions  of  “canon”  and  “archive”  so  firmly  established  in  the  era of print have changed dramatically in a digital regime: “archive” is now  an  incredibly  tenuous  construct  given  the  instability  of  digital  data,  and  “canon” can be interpreted either as a concept that is infinitely multipliable   i.e., everyone has her or his own personal canon, but there is no shared  canon  or as a concept that is fully aligned with repertoire, so that we can  have canonical practices but not canonical objects. This impacts how we  must think of digital archives, for we can only now conceive of arguing that  certain archival styles will persist—that is, certain ways of constructing and  designing archives, certain types of archives, certain tendencies in archival  practice—rather than arguing that specific archives will endure.    2  Archival Styles: Universal, Community, and Alternative  Digital Preservation Projects Chapter  Archival   2 Styles  The Proliferation Tradition  In this chapter, I will discuss three major digital archival styles, to which  I  assign  the  names  “universal,”  “community,”  and  “alternative.”  These  archival styles have been the most frequently employed, most prominent  and dominant styles employed in rogue digital archiving since this type of  activity began four decades ago, but they cannot be said to be “canonical”  methods of archiving—in fact, I will explain how each style is anticanonical  in its way.  Rogue archives reject what Raymond Williams called “the selective tradi- tion” of culture  Williams 2009, 47 —the custom by which a “minority” of  experts chooses, from all cultural documents, the percentage that are put  safely  into  repositories,  and  the  even  smaller  fraction  that  comprise  the  cultural canon, which is the short list of visual, literary, and musical pro- ductions that every member of that culture should learn, appreciate, engage  with deeply and repeatedly, and hold in common with every other member  of the culture.  Pierre Nora [1984] argues that archives are often as selective  as canons; he defines the work of “professionals of the archive” thus: “Pro- fessionals have learned that the secret of this trade is the art of controlled  destruction” [xxvii].   The selective tradition, so prevalent in the print era, already faced chal- lenges before the rise of new media. Rogue archivists amplify the challenge  to selectivity that began in the 1960s. Rogue archives operate according to  a logic of proliferation rather than selection. What proliferates in a system  of digital cultural memory is, first of all, the number and kinds of archives  in existence, as the affordances built into digital technologies enable more  and more people to undertake archival projects. And, with an increasing  number of archives accessible to all Internet users  and this broad accessi- bility is a major difference from the archives of the print era, which erected    74   Chapter 2  strong barriers to use, if only by restricting use to those who could physi- cally enter their structures , the process of canonization becomes severely  monadic. Every individual user must make decisions about what to select  and incorporate into her or his personal, unique canons from the wide range  of cultural archives available to them. Digital cultural memory consists of  an extreme multiplicity of archives, and a multitude of personal cultural  canons derived from those archives—many millions of canons-of-one—a  return to what Michel Foucault  1986  describes as the seventeenth-century  mode of archiving, when “museums and libraries were the expression of  an individual choice”  26 . In the workings of digital cultural memory, the  selective tradition gives way to a proliferation tradition.  Below,  I  will  briefly  gloss  the  universal,  community,  and  alternative  archival styles, and list a number of archives that I consider to be exemplars  of each. The discussion of specific archives will, I think, allow the phenom- enon of hacker fan amateur pirate volunteer archiving to take more con- crete shape for the reader. Also, because I will name the founders of these  archives  and  describe  their  contributions  whenever  possible,  I  hope  that  the  reader  will  better  grasp  the  immense  amount  of  “techno-volunteer”  labor that has been required to bring these online repositories into being  and support them over time.  After guiding the reader through what I perceive to be the three main  digital  archival  styles,  I  will  introduce  my  primary  case  study  of  digital  archives:  Internet  fan  fiction  archives.  Fan  fiction   also  called  “fanfic”  or “fic”  archives, built by fan archivists, store the creative output of fan  communities,  that  output  often  taking  the  form  of  fictional  stories  that  incorporate characters, plots, and settings from favored media texts  films,  television programs, comic books, anime, popular music, and so on . I view  fanfic archives as paradigmatic rogue digital archives, as they combine the  key characteristics of all three archival styles: they are simultaneously uni- versal, community, and alternative archives. A study of fanfic archives can  therefore illustrate the motivations, methods, and challenges that have so  far defined digital archiving.   My  own  long-term  affiliation  with  online  fan  fiction  communities  and archives  dating from 1999  means that I have a deeper understand- ing  of  the  work  of  fanfic  archivists,  and  the  workings  of  fanfic  archives,  than  I  do  of  other  types  of  Internet  archivists  and  archives.  In  addition,  my history, and my research team members’ histories, of involvement with  fanfic  archives  enabled  us  to  recruit  fifty  participants  for  an  oral  history  project focused on the evolution of these archives, and the interviews that  we collected have contributed greatly to my thinking on, and analysis of,    Archival Styles   75  fanfic archives as a specific instance of digital archiving, as well as digital  archiving as a trending practice. Therefore, in the chapters that follow, I will  make reference to the specific archives that I describe below, with most of  my investigation centering on the archives constructed by and for media  fans for their fiction production.  I  will  also  discuss  how  all  three  core  digital  archival  styles  are  antica- nonical,  in  that  they  are  attempting  to  do  away  with  traditional,  print- era notions of “canon,” “canonization,” and “canonicity.” I have already  reviewed  the  two  major  large  anticanon  movements  that  began  in  the  United  States  in  the  1960s:  the  movement  to  do  away  with  distinctions  between “high” and “low” culture and to incorporate low popular mass  commercial texts into the arenas of high art construction exhibition and  scholarly  analysis exegesis;  and  the  movement  to  expand  university  cur- ricula and research programs to include the study of ethnicities, genders,  sexualities, and other categories of people that had long been marginalized  by, or entirely excluded from, higher education. The digital archives that  I  will  name  here  continue  one  or  both  of  these  attacks  against  the  idea  of a predominantly Global North, white-, and male-authored high-culture  canon, and also battle the concept of canonicity in other ways.  Universal archives seek to replace canonicity and selective archiving— the  process  by  which  a  small  number  of  critics  or  experts  choose  which  works are “worth” teaching and rereading generation after generation, and  which  works  are  sufficiently  “valuable”  to  keep  safe  in  protective  store- houses—with comprehensive archiving, a process that strives to collect as  many cultural texts as possible, to make all the texts equally accessible to  the public, and to present all the texts as equally valuable.   Community archives support the canon-expansion work that was begun  by university reformists, striving to assemble and preserve texts that origi- nate from, or bear direct relevance to, cultures that have been historically  marginalized  in  traditional  memory  institutions.  Such  archives  stand  as  countercanons  to  the  cultural  canon  dominated  by  the  most  privileged  members of society, and encourage an understanding of cultural canonicity  as always multiple  allowing for many canons representing many cultures ,  or as always specific  each canon representing a singular, specific culture,  and never representing “everyone” .  Alternative archives propose new canons, canons of new types of objects  or objects that are ignored by traditional archives. These archives do not  seek to replace print-era cultural canons, but are content to let their assem- blies of odd, strange, controversial, nongeneric, or radically new texts stand  alongside those older sets of privileged works. Alternative archives employ    76   Chapter 2  nonnormative criteria in assessing artistic value and historical importance,  and, like community archives, call for an acceptance of multiple canons— at least one canon for every novel, degraded, or “forgotten” genre of cul- tural production.  I bring up the specter of canonicity in part to assert that what follows is  not a suggested set of canonical archives, but simply a number of archives  that, in my view, are interesting and important examples of the increas- ingly popular practice of digital archiving. I find these archives “good to  think with,” when considering what archiving is today, what it is becom- ing, whose efforts are making digital archives possible, and whose ideas of  archiving are influencing all of our ideas about archiving. Digital archiving  is deliberately opposed to the canonization of specific texts, and thus works  to undo some of the core priorities of print-era cultural memory. Also, the  chances that any of these particular archives will endure for more than one  or two generations is minuscule—and many online archives built in the last  quarter-century have already disappeared—but what is clearly ascendant,  what  is  being  enacted  with  increasing  frequency  and  sophistication,  is  a  repertoire of specific styles of archiving. In other words, what I describe in  this chapter is how more and more people are doing-archiving using digital  tools and networks, over and over again, regardless of what they are choos- ing to archive.  Traits of Rogue Digital Archives  Before I go into detail about what differentiates the three main digital archi- val  styles,  and  describe  specific  archives  that  exemplify  each  style,  I  will  offer the reader a list of the traits shared by all of these “rogue” archives:     They  are  freely  accessible  online,  that  is,  they  are  not  hidden  behind  paywalls or institutional password-protected walls. Some of these archives,  such as “Sly”1 and Open Library, require users to register on the site and  to  maintain  their  “good  standing”   as  defined  by  the  rules  of  each  site   in order to access the archives’ content, but membership is not fee based  or  predicated  on  any  institutional  affiliation.  JSTOR  and  other  academic  archives that require either payment or a university ID login are therefore  not among the archives that I am studying.    They allow users to view or download cultural texts in their entirety. I do  not consider encyclopedic projects such as Wikis to be archives, since they  mostly offer factual information and commentary about cultural texts, and  not the texts themselves.   Archival Styles   77     They are not restricted by copyright laws. Some archivists only upload  texts that have entered the public domain  such Project Gutenberg , some  archive  texts  to  which  they  own  the  copyright   such  as  the  FAMA  Col- lection , some adhere to the copyright permissions used by public librar- ies   such  as  Open  Library,  many  of  whose  texts  readers  can  borrow,  but  not  download  permanently ,  some  claim  that  their  activities  are  permit- ted by fair use  such as Download Finished , and some simply contravene  copyright laws that they feel hinder, rather than help, cultural preservation   such as the Eldritch Press and Sly . I am not studying YouTube because, in  addition to being a for-profit, Google-owned platform and therefore driven  by very different motivations than the archives I am investigating, YouTube  “reserves the right to remove Content and User Submissions without prior  notice,” and most of its takedowns are motivated by suspicions of copy- right infringement.2 Though many users consider YouTube to be something  like a media archive, the platform’s position on copyright means that it can- not be relied upon to protect, or keep accessible, all of the content uploaded  to it.    They  were  founded  outside  of  traditional  memory  institutions  such  as  government- and university-supported libraries and archives and museums  of physical artifacts. Thus, I am not including projects such as the Hemi- spheric Institute’s Digital Video Library or Cornell University’s Rose Goldsen  Archive of New Media Art Archive, which were founded with the support  of university libraries, even though they share many other traits with rogue  archives. Although some of the rogue archives that I will describe below  run on university servers and receive university support, they were not con- ceived by, or even in cooperation with, university LIS teams and are not  extensions or subprojects of university libraries.    They are dedicated to the persistent publication and long-term preserva- tion of their contents.    Their founders and workers are people who, for the most part, received  no  formal  training  in  archiving  or  records  management  and  are  not  LIS  professionals.    They are staffed primarily, or entirely, by volunteers.  Universal Digital Archives  What  I  call  “universal”  digital  archives  set  for  themselves  missions  of  extreme breadth, and aim for all-inclusiveness. Project Gutenberg wishes to  make every book in the public domain available online. The Rosetta Project  aims to preserve all known human languages. Open Library hopes to one    78   Chapter 2  day host “a web page for every book ever published.” Archive Team’s infor- mal motto is “We Are Going to Rescue Your Shit.” Each universal archive  strives to become the defining digital archive of its kind, or even, in the  case of the Internet Archive, the preeminent digital archive. Their common  goal of comprehensiveness matches Vannevar Bush’s original aspiration for  the  memex.  Everyone  who  works  on  these  archives  labors  intensively  to  make the Internet fulfill Bush’s  1945  dream of a machine-based system  that will “encompass the great record”  sec. 8 , even as the vast quantity of  work they put into digital preservation underscores that the Internet falls  far short of an automatic memory machine.  The  adjective  “universal”  carries  a  certain  historical  weight,  or  “bag- gage.”  For  centuries,  Enlightenment  language  and  thought  defined  the  “universal”  subject,  the  possessor  of  natural,  innate  “universal”  rights,  as  a  white   European-descended ,  heterosexual,  able-bodied  male  of  the  bourgeois  or  propertied  class  in  the  Global  North.  I  do  not  think  it  is  a  coincidence that all of the “universal” archives I will describe in this subsec- tion were created by educated white American or European men, most of  them computer programmers. I do not argue that these archives’ goals of  completism and comprehensiveness were wholly determined by the race,  class, and gender of their founders, but there is some resonance between  the founders’ common status as “unmarked” persons3 and their interest in  creating “unmarked” archives, that is, archives that are not designated to be  relevant to particular Internet users, but are intended for use by all people  who have access to the Internet. These archives’ organization, presentation,  and content selection make no reference to identity differences—races eth- nicities,  nationalities,  geographies,  physical  abilities,  genders,  sexualities,  political  or  class  affiliations.  These,  more  than  any  other  rogue  archives,  could easily be taken for new expressions of the Enlightenment’s affection  for  “‘totalizing’  and  ‘universal’  representations  which  reject  and  obscure  … local knowledge and nuances”  Edney 1999, 167 , and for “abstract and  strictly functional systems for the factual ordering of phenomena in space”   Harvey 1989, 249 .  Some universal archives are among the earliest online archives created   illustrating  the  fact  that  one  specific  race gender class  of  people  gained  network  access,  and  the  skills  and  opportunities  to  build  new  virtual  spaces,  earlier  than  others ,  and  have  become  sufficiently  sizeable  and  famous  enough  to  warrant  speculation  that  they  could  one  day  soon  be  promoted as important cultural resource repositories, like the Smithsonian  or the Library of Congress, by schoolteachers to their students. They could  join the ranks of many privately founded institutions that became public    Archival Styles   79  treasures,  such  as  Benjamin  Franklin’s  Library  Company  of  Philadelphia   which  inaugurated  the  free  lending  library  system  in  the  United  States   and the Museum of Modern Art  MoMA . Something like a history of digi- tal archiving could be agreed upon by new media scholars, and the story  of universal archives that I tell below might be regarded as a draft of such  a  history.  In  other  words,  these  archives’  apparent  disinterest  in  identity  politics  and  their  completist  missions  may  make  them  prime  candidates  for incorporation into educational curricula and into mainstream cultural  heritage and history practices in the near future.   Rather than operating in the “selective tradition” described above, uni- versal digital archives are aligned with Raymond Williams’s wish for a pres- ervation  of  “documentary  culture”  which,  “more  clearly  than  anything  else,” can express the life of a past period “to us in direct terms, when the  living witnesses are silent.” The selective tradition causes much of the docu- mentary record of a “lived culture” and its particular “structure of feeling,”  to be lost  Williams [1961] 2001, 65–66 . Working against such loss, uni- versal online archives strive to save and keep as much of the documentary  culture as they can acquire and digitize, presumably for the benefit of future  users who will be able to reconstruct “structures of feeling” of a past period  with more ease and accuracy than they would have been able to do from  the documents selected for preservation by print cultural memory.  Here is a list of some of the most well-trafficked universal digital archives   in chronological order  organized by their founding dates .  Project  Gutenberg  was  the  first  online  archive  of  cultural  material,  founded in 1971 by Michael Hart while he was an undergraduate student at  the University of Illinois. Hart was friends with the operators of the univer- sity’s Materials Research Lab’s Xerox Sigma V mainframe, and these friends,  searching for uses for the mainframe, awarded Hart an operator’s account  and a “grant” of unlimited computer time. Hart decided to “repay the huge  value  of  the  computer  time  that  he  had  been  given”  by  facilitating  “the  storage, retrieval, and searching of what was stored in our libraries”  Hart  1992 . Hart initially digitized and uploaded all of the books himself, averag- ing one book per month in 1991. In the 1990s, he began recruiting volun- teers “from numerous nations to help type, scan, and or proofread Project  Gutenberg’s  ‘eBooks,’”  and  by  2008,  newly  digitized  books  were  being  uploaded to Project Gutenberg at a rate of 340 per month, owing to the  work of “tens of thousands of volunteers in various teams”  Lebert 2008 .  Project Gutenberg initially ran on the ARPANET  Advanced Research Proj- ects Agency Network , the precursor of the Internet, when few people had  access to the network. When Hart opened Project Gutenberg, there were no    80   Chapter 2  hyperlinks, no websites, and no graphical user interfaces, and if Hart had  tried to email his first 5K text file—a digital version of the US Declaration of  Independence, which he uploaded on July 4, 1971, the 195th anniversary  of the Declaration’s signing—to the one hundred computers that were then  linked to ARPANET, he “would have crashed the network”  Lebert 2008 ,  so he stored the file in a directory and issued a message stating where oth- ers could find it.  Six users downloaded the Declaration file, indicating to  Hart that Project Gutenberg could be a service that some found useful.  The  system of networked computing had to become more robust, more popular,  and more accessible before large-scale digital archiving could begin.  Digital  archiving  began  in  earnest  in  1992,  one  year  after  the  launch  of the World Wide Web, which marked the beginning of what I call the  “public Internet,” that is, the Internet whose user group was not limited to  employees and researchers at universities, research labs, and government  institutions—the Internet that could be used by anyone who had access to,  and knowledge of, computer hardware, network protocols, and an Internet  service provider  ISP . In the early ’90s, many people participated online at  their workplaces, but early ISPs such as CompuServe and America Online   AOL  facilitated the growth of home-based networked computing.  In 1992, Judson Knott and Paul Jones designed and opened the SunSITE. unc.edu website. SunSITE was named for Sun Microsystems, the corporate  donor whose grants made the site possible. It began, and is still housed, at  the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and was eventually mirrored  at more than twenty other institutions. SunSITE, later known as MetaLab  and now called ibiblio, started as “one of the first electronic repositories  on the Internet to incorporate emerging networked information discovery  and retrieval tools”  Knott and Jones 1996  such as Wide Area Information  Server  or WAIS, a text searching system; WAIS was developed by Think- ing  Machines,  Inc.,  a  company  that  included  Brewster  Kahle,  who  later  founded the Internet Archive  and Gopher  a pre–World Wide Web proto- col for distributing, searching, and retrieving documents on the Internet .  SunSITE’s purpose was to build a library of content and make it searchable  and readable by a large number of users; one of the first content collections  hosted on the site were documents contributed by the 1992 Clinton Cam- paign  the Clinton White House went on to share a great deal of official  presidential text documents with SunSITE .  Linux distributions were among SunSITE’s most frequently downloaded  content. The Linux kernel was developed by Linus Torvalds and released in  October 1991 with the intention that the kernel would serve as the basis of  free and open software development; Linux distributions, or “distros,” are    Archival Styles   81  the multiple, varied operating systems built atop the Linux kernel. SunSITE  archived  not  only  the  distros  themselves,  but  also  the  guides  created  by  the Linux Documentation Project, which is “an organization of volunteers  authoring, reviewing and managing documents about the Linux operating  system”  Garrels 2004 . Garrels  2004  writes that between 1992 and 1996,  “Sunsite  a famous server machine at the University of North Carolina  …  was the first Web site offering information about Linux. Also, when you  wanted to download Linux software, Sunsite.unc.edu was the place to go.”  Sunsite Metalab ibiblio  thus  started  as  an  archive  of  archives,  a  database  of databases, a “collection of collections”: “It began as one of the world’s  first online libraries and as a way to share and support all kinds of free soft- ware. … From Project Gutenberg  the famous free book archive  to etree.org   where fans of tape-friendly bands share concert music , and from charities  and non-profits both locally and worldwide … to video documentaries of  folk practice, ibiblio.org hosts one of the largest collections of collections  on the Internet”  ibiblio, “About” . On ibiblio’s “People” page, one finds  the header “Meet the people of ibiblio.org who, collectively, never sleep,”  followed  by  a  list  of  four  individuals,  and  a  link  to  another  page  titled  “Former ibiblio staff members” listing 79 people. These are, apparently, all  of the people who have had a hand in managing and operating ibiblio’s  archiving efforts since 1992.  Another  important  online  archive  from  the  mid-1990s  was  Eldritch  Press, now hosted by ibiblio. As related by Lawrence Lessig in Free Culture,  in 1995, Eric Eldred, a retired disabled computer programmer, “was frus- trated that his daughters didn’t seem to like [the works of canonical Ameri- can author Nathaniel] Hawthorne” and so “decided to put Hawthorne on  the Web. An electronic version, Eldred thought, with links to pictures and  explanatory text, would make this nineteenth-century author’s work come  alive”   Lessig  2004,  213 .  Eldred’s  experiment  with  digitizing  Hawthorne  motivated  him  to  “build  a  library  of  public  domain  works  by  scanning  these works and making them available for free” on the Internet, and not  only copies of the works, but “derivative works from these public domain  works”   213 .  The  online  library  Eldritch  Press  was  Eldred’s  variant  on  Project Gutenberg: rather than offering up “clean” digital copies of public  domain books as Project Gutenberg did, Eldritch Press offered modified cop- ies  with “pictures and explanatory text” . When the US Congress passed  the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act  CTEA  in 1998, extending  the terms of existing copyright “for the eleventh time in forty years”  Les- sig 2004, 214 , Eldred found he could not legally post Robert Frost’s poetry  collection New Hampshire online  New Hampshire was originally published    82   Chapter 2  in 1923, and because of the CTEA, the book will not enter public domain  until 2019 .  Eldred  decided  to  wage  a  legal  battle  against  the  copyright  extension,  and Lessig represented him in the courts, eventually arguing Eldred’s case— and  the  case  against  indefinite,  unlimited  copyright  extensions  and  an  apparent  end  to  the  notion  of  a  public  domain—before  the  US  Supreme  Court in 2002 in Eldred v. Ashcroft. The Court ruled against Eldred, and Les- sig began crusading against unlimited copyright through his writing  Free  Culture is dedicated to Eldred  and his participation in the nonprofit organi- zation Creative Commons, whose licenses allow creators to place modified  copyrights on their works, in order to give others the right to “share, use,  and even build upon” those works  Creative Commons, “About” . In the  lore of the copyright wars over digital remix, peer-to-peer file sharing, and  “piracy” that began raging in the late-1990s and continue today, Eldred v.  Ashcroft, Lessig’s activism, and Creative Commons are all famous elements.  Less well-remembered is that Eldritch Press, a free online archive of modi- fied classic novels launched and operated by a single hobbyist, was at the  heart of some of the most crucial early copyright battles involving digital  technologies.  In 1997, Brewster Kahle published an essay in Scientific American called  “Archiving  the  Internet,”  in  which  he  announced  that  he  had  created  a  new organization, the Internet Archive, the year prior, which was “collect- ing the public materials on the Internet to construct a digital library. The  first step is to preserve the contents of this new medium. This collection  will include all publicly accessible World Wide Web pages, the Gopher hier- archy,  the  Netnews  bulletin  board  system,  and  downloadable  software.”  Kahle  1997  draws upon the “digital dark age” discourse, without employ- ing the exact phrase:  While the Internet’s World Wide Web is unprecedented in spreading the popular  voice  of  millions  that  would  never  have  been  published  before,  no  one  recorded  these documents and images from 1 year ago. The history of early materials of each  medium  is  one  of  loss  and  eventual  partial  reconstruction  through  fragments.  A  group of entrepreneurs and engineers have determined to not let this happen to the  early Internet.  Even though the documents on the Internet are the easy documents to collect  and archive, the average lifetime of a document is 75 days and then it is gone. While  the changing nature of the Internet brings a freshness and vitality, it also creates  problems for historians and users alike. …  Where we can read the 400 year-old books printed by Gutenberg, it is often dif-  ficult to read a 15 year-old computer disk. …   Archival Styles   83  Building the Internet Archive involves gathering, storing, and serving the tera-  bytes of information that at some point were publicly accessible on the Internet.  The Internet Archive officially made its online repositories public in 2001,  and today stores 16 petabytes of data. While the Archive is not staffed exclu- sively by volunteers  it employs approximately 200 people ,4 it depends on  a volunteer force for media migration, book scanning, and various day-to- day operations such as event planning. Kahle himself is the public repre- sentative  of  the  Archive  and  its  Wayback  Machine   described  in  chapter  1 ,  promoting  his  project  of  “building  the  great  library”  and  having  the  Archive  serve  as  a  “home  for  the  [cultural]  commons”   Conrad  2014   in  numerous  interviews  and  talks  every  year.  It  is  ironic  that,  of  the  digital  cultural  memory  projects  mentioned  here,  the  most  automated  archive   although the Internet Archive hosts far more content than that collected  by the Wayback Machine  probably has the most visible human face and  voice in the press.  The Long Now Foundation’s Rosetta Project was launched by Alexander  Rose, Stewart Brand, and Doug Carlston  with input from Brewster Kahle   around  2006.  The  Rosetta  Project  has  archived  text  documentation  and  or multimedia recordings of over 2,500 languages, and intends to “build  a publicly accessible digital library of material on the nearly 7,000 known  human languages”  The Rosetta Project, “The Rosetta Project—Texts” . The  project is hosted at the Internet Archive.5  Open  Library  was  founded  in  2006  by  famed  Internet  activist  Aaron  Swartz and other collaborators. The library is primarily “an open, editable  library catalog, building towards a web page for every book ever published,”  but it also allows users to download and borrow full ebooks. It currently  offers more than one million out-of-copyright  “classic”  ebooks for down- load, mostly through the Internet Archive’s collection of digital texts  the  Internet Archive hosts Open Library , and hundreds of thousands of copy- righted  “modern”  ebooks for borrowing, through cooperation with public  libraries all over the world. Open Library encourages registered readers to  contribute to, and correct, catalog information as well as to submit patches  to the Open Library API on a volunteer basis.  Archive  Team  was  begun  in  2009  by  Jason  Scott   an  employee  of  the  Internet  Archive   and  a  group  of  fellow  self-described  “rogue  archivists,  programmers, writers and loudmouths dedicated to saving our digital heri- tage.” The Team has downloaded a number of large websites and networks  that were facing permanent deletion. They also make copies of sites that are  not endangered, as a precaution against those sites’ disappearance. Their    84   Chapter 2  first  massive  archival  download  was  the  Web-hosting  service  GeoCities   on which many first-generation Internet users designed and ran their first  websites in the 1990s . Wrote journalist Austin Modine in 2009, as Yahoo!   GeoCities’ parent company  prepared to close the service, “Geocities is a  resource worthy of preservation if there ever was one. Nearly two decades[’]  worth of blinking text, animated gifs, fanfiction, and broken links are at  risk of disappearing with the blink of the eye. This is the personal internet  young,  raw  and  blemished—before  big  blogging  services  and  social  net- working sites arrived to completely homogenize the space”  Modine 2009 .  Other sites saved by Archive Team just prior to their closures are FortuneC- ity,  MobileMe,  Posterous,  Snapjoy,  and  GoogleReader;  Archive  Team  also  has  saved  a  copy  of  FanFiction.net  and  selected  streams sections  of  Red- dit, Facebook, and Twitter, all of which are  currently  thriving sites and  services, “just in case.” Users can download many of the sites preserved by  Archive Team at their site or from their page at the Internet Archive. The  Team  is  “100%  composed  of  volunteers  and  interested  parties”   Archive  Team, “About” ; a 2009 TIME article covering the Team’s rescue of GeoCi- ties’ data reported that “30 people operating nearly 100 computers” worked  for “nearly six months to download as many of the GeoCities pages as they  could find”  Fletcher 2009 .  Community Digital Archives  Not all digital archiving projects are informed or guided by universal think- ing. Many online archives are of, for, and by highly specific communities,  including communities defined by ethnic, national, geographic, linguistic,  or temporal identities  or intersections of two or more of these  and com- munities of affinity. Stevens, Flinn, and Shepherd  2010  write that online  “community  archives”  have  been  created  in  increasingly  large  numbers  since  2000  by  “historically  marginalized  groups  for  greater  visibility  for  their histories.”  I regard such archives and their archivists as participants in what Flinn   2007  calls the “community archives ‘movement’”  152–153 . Flinn traces  the origins of this movement to the post–World War II period, when “local  history became increasingly popular and respectable both as an academic  discipline  and  at  a  non-professional  grassroots  level”   155 .  British  local  history groups were informed by “the developments in oral history, the His- tory Workshop movement and public history in the 1970s and 1980s, all of  which tended to be inspired by ‘an allegiance to those whose lives are still  excluded from historical practice and a commitment to praxis which places    Archival Styles   85  emphasis on what is being said rather than the status of who is saying it’”   155–156 . This type of amateur and community archiving has only grown  in the UK, the United States, and elsewhere over the past thirty years, with  many  “independent  cultural  heritage  initiatives  [emerging]  directly  out  of a context of marginalization … and struggle”  156–158 . Archives cre- ated to house documents pertaining to the lives and cultures of working- class laborers, ethnic and religious minorities, LGBT and queer people, and  women are among these  156–158 .  Thus, born-digital archives, founded independently of traditional mem- ory institutions, serve both extraordinarily generalist and highly particu- lar  aims.  Amateur,  volunteer,  nonprofessional  digital  archiving  has  been  undertaken both by white male hackers and engineers driven by motives  similar to those of Bush—the safeguarding and transmission of enormous  corpuses of information in order to perpetuate and augment human knowl- edge writ large—and by minoritarian communities that have exploited new  media’s democratizing potentials to launch archives for their own cultural  artifacts, which were often ignored, excluded, or marginalized by the offi- cial state-sponsored brick-and-mortar archives of print and analog culture.  What unites the two groups of Internet archivists is their archival labor: the  time, effort, and skills that they have devoted to creating, and maintaining,  sites of digital cultural memory.  Community digital archives resist notions of “canonicity.” For example,  designating  some  community  archives  “canonical”  would  be  impossible.  Such archives are designed for use by the members of specific groups, so  that they may experience a sense of belonging and better understand differ- ent aspects of their shared identity; so none of these archives can be deemed  “better” than others, only more or less relevant or pertinent to individual  users. In addition, community archives are philosophically opposed to both  the broad valorization of canonical cultural texts  as stated above, Williams  argues that such valorization almost always reflects the tastes and interests  of the dominant class, giving the impression that, for the most part, minor- ity groups produce no cultural texts of importance , and to the canoniza- tion of specific items within their collections, as their goal is to gather and  preserve as much material as possible pertaining to their members. Thus, a  canon of community archives could never be proposed for use by a general  audience, but each individual could point to a set of community archives  that they find interesting and compelling for personal reasons.  Here  is  a  short  list  of  several  specific  online  community  archives  that   greatly interest me.   86   Chapter 2  The FAMA Collection is a repository of creative works made by Sarajevo  artists  during  the  Bosnian  War;  one  such  artist,  Suada  Kapic,  founded  it  in the mid-2000s and it remains operational today. The collection’s mis- sion is to “bring home the human scale of events, places and experiences  of the Siege of Sarajevo ’92–’96.” “As a virtual Bank of Knowledge, it aims  to  bridge  a  digital  divide  between  the  Culture  of  Remembrance  and  the  Real-Time  Quest  for  knowledge”   http:  www.famacollection.org eng  .  Throughout  the  war,  FAMA’s  art  projects,  such  as  Kapic’s  dark  parody  of  tourist pamphlets, the Sarajevo Survival Guide, disseminated crucial informa- tion about the human rights violations and daily horrors taking place in  the former Yugoslavia to Western Europe and the United States. Therefore,  the digital archiving of the FAMA works amounts to an effort to save valu- able artworks that were also effectively weapons of antiwar. Although the  FAMA Collection could also be considered an alternative archive  I describe  alternative archives below , its major goal is to communicate the experi- ences  of  a  people  who  lived  under  siege,  who  endured  one  of  the  most  brutal  ethnic  conflicts  in  the  post–World  War  II  period,  not  to  create  an  alternative canon to that found in art museums.  The  South  Asian  American  Digital  Archive   SAADA   is  a  collection  of  ephemera   personal  letters,  flyers,  magazine  articles,  photographs,  and  so on  that documents the experiences of South Asian immigrants to the  United States. SAADA was created by Samip Mallick in 2008. Mallick states  that SAADA is the only archive “working to systematically document and  preserve the history of the South Asian American community. … We feared  that this important history was in danger of being lost. Our mission is not  just to preserve the history of our community, but also to ensure that these  histories are more widely known to everyone, especially within our own  community.” Archive volunteer Manan Desai relates that SAADA’s goal is  “providing  access  to  historical  materials  directly  to  the  public  without  a  great  deal  of  mediation.  Our  goal  is  to  allow  the  reader  to  confront  and  understand the material for her or himself”  Ganeshananthan 2011 .  The  Radfem  Archive,  a  website  that  offers  free  downloadable  texts  of  “radical feminist literature, writing and history,” was launched in 2011 by  anonymous archivists. The archivists state that they were driven to build  Radfem by an awareness that “the popular books will get reprinted, while  the unpopular, forgotten books will continue to stay out of print and out of  the minds of future generations.” For example, they argue, “Most of [anti- pornography activist] Andrea Dworkin’s books are currently out of print,  some for many years. … With this project, we hope that people will read  and reread her work. We hope that her ideas will not be ‘buried with her’    Archival Styles   87  and lost to future generations. We hope her anger, her voice and her ideas  rediscovered will get us all that much closer to the days of liberation that  she dreamed [of] and fought for”  Radical Content Collective 2011 .  The  Michigan Trans  Controversy  Archive  saves  news  articles,  press  releases,  essays,  open  letters,  petitions,  and  interviews  about  “the  ongo- ing  controversy  over  the  exclusion  of  transsexual  [people]   both  male- to-female  and  female-to-male   at  the  annual  Michigan  Womyn’s  Music  Festival  [MWMF]”   http:  eminism.org michigan  .  Emi  Koyama  has  run  the archive as a subsite of her personal website, eminism.org, since 2013.  The policy of exclusion of trans people from the MWMF has been the sub- ject of heated debate in feminist and LGBTQ communities since at least the  early 1990s, when a group of women  trans and cis  began protesting the  policy by organizing an annual event called Camp Trans that takes place at  the border of the festival grounds, at the same time as the festival.  The projects I have described here are but a handful of a legion of online  archives created by members of minority and marginalized communities  over the past twenty-five years, intended to preserve the artifacts and cul- tural productions that are meaningful to them, in the hopes of conveying  core information about their shared values, experiences, histories, identi- ties, and affinities across their membership and across time, to their future  membership, their constituents-to-come.  Alternative Digital Archives  What I call “alternative” digital archives take a markedly different approach  to data collection than do universal and community archives. Rather than  trying to acquire  or digitize, as Project Gutenberg, Open Library, and the  Radfem Archive do  and safeguard as many cultural texts as possible, alter- native and avant-garde archives limit their scope to targeted genres, and  often serve as central repositories for emerging or degraded genres. They  still may resemble universal archives in their aims; for instance, Sly states  that it is building a “comprehensive library” of non-Hollywood films. But  unlike universal archives, these are not generalist collections. Rather, alter- native  archivists  seek  to  define  new  “universes”  of  art  and  media  forms,  forms  that  have  not   yet   been  granted  significant  status  by  traditional  memory institutions. They are assembling diverse and robust collections of  nonmainstream cultural genres.  These  online  collections  facilitate  the  emergence  of  new  canons  by  making  accessible  large  collections  of  alternative  material.  In  so  doing,  they  question  the  supremacy  and  authority  of  traditional  canons  of  art    88   Chapter 2  and media. Alternative archives fill a gap left by “high” art museums and  film  libraries’  reluctance  to  recognize  or  incorporate  certain  genres;  they  function as the online museums libraries of emerging, ignored, or derided  genres. They do not seek acceptance by, or mergers with, what Lisa Lewis   1992  calls “official” culture, but operate alongside and independently of  that culture. These are online archives of different cultures, other cultures,  and subcultures.  Many art projects could fall into this category. I have decided to list only  two projects by artists’ collectives, Netbase and Download Finished, which  are both still accessible by the public, even though they have been discon- tinued and are no longer adding new works. I am not including projects  that  have  gone  dark  and  are  inaccessible,  such  as  the  HILUS  Intermedia  Project Research, “the first integrated reference system for media art, video,  new media and art in Austria,” which operated from 1992 to 1996  Rhi- zome.org 1996 . It appears that volunteers continue to maintain Netbase  and Download Finished, despite their having ceased activity several years  ago; as I have argued, only persistent human labor keeps online archives  operational  and  usable,  and  when  that  labor  ceases  to  be  invested  in  an  archive,  the  collapse  of  that  archive  inevitably  follows,  immediately  or  eventually.  Netbase, an “Institute for New Culture Technologies,” was founded by  Konrad Becker and Francisco de Sousa Webber in 1995  as Public Netbase ;  in 2006, the right-wing Austrian government withdrew funding from the  project and dismantled the Netbase organization, despite Netbase’s having  won prestigious awards such as the Prix Arts Electronica 1995 and the Prize  of the City of Vienna 2000. Its archive hosts the websites, as well as text,  image, and video documentation, of a number of political art events that  took place in Western Europe during Netbase’s active years. These events  include “nikeground”  2003  in which the collective 0100101110101101. ORG temporarily rebranded Vienna’s historic square, Karlsplatz, as “Nike- platz,” as a protest against the ubiquitous corporate branding of European  cultural institutions; and “Free Bitflows,” by exStream  a collaboration of  five European media art organizations , which was a 2004 “digital culture  event” in Vienna, consisting of a conference, an exhibition, and a series of  workshops,  that  investigated  the  question  of  “‘semiotic  democracy,’  that  is[,] the ability of the largest number of people to create and share culture  freely,” while also seeking ways to ensure that “in the context of overabun- dance and heavy-hitting marketing machines, new, independent content  can  still  find  its  audience”   Free  Bitflows,  “About” .  Netbase  also  houses    Archival Styles   89  many documents pertaining to its own activities and its closure by the Aus- trian government.  The  Rhizome  ArtBase  is  the  most  prominent  “online  archive  of  new  media  art.”  Mark  Tribe  founded  the  ArtBase  in  1999  with  a  handful  of  volunteers,  who  later  became  grant-funded  employees   including  Alex- ander  Galloway,  now  a  prominent  new  media  theorist ,  at  Tribe’s  digital  arts  platform  Rhizome.org.  ArtBase  “provides  an  online  home  for  works  that  employ  materials  such  as  software,  code,  websites,  moving  images,  games  and  browsers  towards  aesthetic  and  critical  ends.”  It  now  houses  over  2,100  works,  and  regularly  acquires  new  works  through  artist  sub- missions   reviewed  by  the  curatorial  staff   as  well  as  through  invitations  and commissions that it extends to artists. The ArtBase provides not only  storage but technical support for the works in its collection: “As any artist  who has worked with technology for more than a few years can verify— things break. … We aim to ensure the longevity of these works, … mitigat- ing obsolescence while respecting artistic intent”  Rhizome.org, “About the  Rhizome ArtBase” .  The private file-sharing site Sly opened in 2005  by my best estimate ,  which  is  building  “a  comprehensive  library  of  Arthouse,  Cult,  Classic,  Experimental and rare movies from all over the world,” and currently hosts  over 130,000 torrents. As is the case for most private peer-to-peer  p2p  file- sharing sites, the founders of Sly conceal their identities, but I assume that,  like nearly all pirate sites, Sly is run by unpaid volunteers. In addition, all of  the site’s registered members are, in essence, volunteer workers for the site,  since files can only be transferred between members with their active coop- eration—some members must “seed”  continually upload  files in order for  others  to  acquire   download   them.  As  Tim  O’Reilly  explains   using  the  BitTorrent  p2p  file-sharing  protocol  as  an  exemplar  of  Web  2.0  user  par- ticipation , “the network of downloaders … provide both bandwidth and  data to other users. The more popular the file, in fact, the faster it can be  served, as there are more users providing bandwidth and fragments of the  complete file. … Every BitTorrent consumer brings his [sic] own resources to  the party. There’s an implicit ‘architecture of participation,’ a built-in ethic  of cooperation, in which the service acts primarily as an intelligent broker,  … harnessing the power of the users themselves”  O’Reilly 2005 .  However,  unlike  the  Pirate  Bay  and  other  p2p  torrent  sites,  Sly  is  not  only a network for content sharing, but a network for archive building: the  site incentivizes members to upload new content, including not only film  files but subtitles of films in as many languages as possible, and paratextual  content such as descriptions and reviews of films, posters that accompanied    90   Chapter 2  the films’ theatrical releases, factual information about the making of the  films, and so on. Sly also rewards members for keeping films indexed on  the site “seeded,” or available for download, which also marks its difference  from most p2p sites, which do not require persistent seeding.  Download  Finished  was  created  by  Zurich-  and  London-based  art  col- lective !Mediengruppe Bitnik and “artist entertainer postmodernist” Sven  König. Download Finished, which was active from 2006 through 2009, was  a participatory art platform: the site instructs users to search for a popu- lar  film  title  of  their  choice,  download  that  film  file  via  a  p2p  protocol,  transform the file into a pixelated, highly compressed version, append their  name or pseudonym to the transformed file, and then watch “their” trans- formative artwork  a visitor to the site can still read all of these steps, but  can  no  longer  use  the  search,  download,  and  transformation  functions .  Download Finished now serves primarily as an archive of hundreds of pix- elated  videos  that  people  created  using  the  sites’  affordances:  all  strange  and degraded replays of famous movies, all original appropriative artworks,  executed entirely through the website’s embedded software.  Fan Fiction Archives  In the following sections, I will draw on my research team’s interviews with  fan fiction archivists and users to explain how fanfic archives simultane- ously exemplify the universal, community, and alternative archiving styles.  Having access to the oral history testimonies of one category of archivists  and archive users allows me—and will, I hope, allow the reader—to begin to  comprehend the rich, textured, powerful emotional and intellectual experi- ences undergone by participants in rogue archival cultures. Oral history as a  method aims not only to “fill gaps in written records”  Morrissey 2007, 161   and to compensate for the fact that the “written record simply ignore[s] so  much of the daily life of so many people,” but also to seek “to understand  all forms of subjectivity, … perceptions, and consciousness in all its multi- ple meanings”  Ronald J. Grele, cited in Morrissey 2007, 161 . The “written  record” so far left behind by amateur hacker volunteer pirate fan archivists  is  quite  scarce;  most  archivists’  motivations,  attitudes,  and  thought  pro- cesses have been documented in only a handful of interviews and “FAQ”  or “About Us” sections on websites. The oral histories of fanfic archivists  and archive users that my team and I collected enable me to present a more  complete  picture  of  digital  archiving  than  I  could  have  assembled  had  I  only consulted the published traces of this cultural phenomenon.   Archival Styles   91  Fan Fiction Archives as Universal Archives  Many fanfic archives are universal archives in the sense that their archivists  work to collect all, or as many as possible, of the texts within the fandom,  or subfandom, that they serve. The goal of comprehensiveness, of encom- passing  all  known  fanfic  content  produced  for  a  given  television  series,  film,  or  character  pairing,  guided  the  majority  of  archives  from  approxi- mately 1995 through 2002. These years witnessed the first great wave of  online fan fiction archiving, which many of our oral history participants  called the period of the “central” or “centralized” fanfic archive. The Gossa- mer Project  figures 2.1 and 2.2  is the largest repository of fan fiction based  on the sci-fi television series The X-Files, and one of the best-known single- fandom archives. Chael, one of the three lead archivists of Gossamer  Deir- dre and Vera Heinau are the others , states in his oral history interview that  the benefit of a central archive for a fandom is that fans can easily find the  stories at one site: “If you can search [the Internet], you type in ‘X-Files fan  fiction’ and Gossamer’s going to come up. Because you know, ‘Well, hey,  I’m looking for fan fiction, and I want it to be associated with this TV show.’  And now, you have 35,000 stories at your disposal. Have fun. That’s more  than an afternoon”  Chael 2012 . Vincent Juodvalkis opened Gossamer in  1995, and Gossamer remains the unquestioned primary resource for X-Files  fic. Even though many other smaller X-Files fic archives were active at the  height of the series’ popularity in the late 1990s, our oral history partici- pants repeatedly mentioned Gossamer as the fanfic storehouse for X-Files  fans. States Azure Lunatic  2012 , “I discovered Gossamer pretty early [in its  history], and I was all over that. And having discovered Gossamer, I didn’t  really need to look anywhere else, because there’s all the fic, there.”  Trekiverse  figures 2.3 and 2.4 , an archive of Star Trek–related fic cover- ing all television series and film installations of the Trek franchise  Consta- ble Katie and Stephen Ratliff serve as its lead archivists today , and the Due  South Archive  Figure 2.5 , which contains stories by fans of the Canadian  Mountie-in-Chicago detective show Due South, are two other famous cen- tral fic archives that launched in the mid-1990s and are still active as of this  writing  Speranza is the current lead archivist of the Due South Archive .  A variant of the idea of the centralized fanfic archive that focused on one  fandom was the archive of all stories within a specific genre. For example,  Francesca Coppa relates in her oral history interview that a fan named KS  Nicholas, also known as KS Nick, ran a website called “Slash Fan Fiction on  the Net”  figure 2.6 , containing links to every slash  male male pairing   fan fiction story and site online that she could find. Coppa recalls of KS    92   Chapter 2  Nicholas’s site, “That’s where you lived” if you were a slash fan online in  the late ’90s. “It was just a plain list of, you know, ‘Fairycat’s Highlander Sto- ries,’ with a link. And just one after the other.” Coppa means that KS Nicho- las’s  slash  archive  was  quite  simple  in  appearance—stories  were  grouped  by author name and fandom, and hyperlinks took readers to the authors’  websites or to specific stories—but despite its lack of visual interest, the site  served a crucial purpose for many fans. Coppa says, “[KS Nicholas’s archive  was] a fundamental kind of site for those of us who came in [to Internet  fandom] at that period. You could look at two [web] pages and say, This was  the whole world [of slash fic online]”  Coppa 2012 .  Then,  beginning  in  the  early  2000s,  with  the  rise  of  early  social  net- works  such  as  the  blogging  platform  LiveJournal,  which  did  not  have  robust archiving functionalities, many fandoms ceased to maintain central  archives for fan fiction. Still, the impulse to create centralized fic archives  persisted through the first crest of social media. Fans used social bookmark- ing  sites  such  as  Pinboard  and  Delicious  to  create  more  durable  archives  than  could  be  reasonably  created  on  LiveJournal  blogs   for  example,  the  BSG Femslash Archive [figure 2.7], which contains links to all of the female  female  fanfics  based  on  the  sci-fi  series  Battlestar  Galactica  that  the  lead  archivist could gather, is located on Delicious .  In  the  late  1990s  and  early  2000s,  fans  began  creating  archives  and  archive  software  that  allowed  fan  authors  to  format  and  post  their  own  stories,  rather  than  requiring  “archive  elves,”  as  fan  scholar  Francesca  Coppa calls early fanfic archivists, to code each story submission by hand;  these included Fanfiction.net  FF.net   figures 2.8 and 2.9 , a multifandom  database that opened in 2000  founded by Xing Li , which is the largest  fanfic archive today, and Automated Archive and eFiction, software with  self-upload functions that many fans used to create their own customized  archives. For example, my research team interviewed Liviapenn, one of the  founding archivists of the Smallville Slash Archive  figure 2.10 , dedicated  to  slash  fic  written  for  the  Superman  television  series  Smallville,  which  was built using Automated Archive software; Karen Hellekson, the current  archivist of Warp 5 Complex  figure 2.11 , a Star Trek: Enterprise fic archive,  which  was  built  with  Automated  Archive  software  and  then  migrated  to  eFiction; and Robin Nelson, one of the founding archivists of Gossip-Fic. net  figure 2.12 , a Gossip Girl fic archive, which was also constructed with  eFiction software.  Some fans created multifandom archives for specific genres rather than  for specific source texts or pairings: oxoniensis opened an archive of the  fics generated by her annual  or, in some years, semiannual  writing festival    Archival Styles   93  The Porn Battle  figures 2.13 and 2.14  in 2006, and jinjurly launched the  Audiofic Archive  figure 2.15 , a repository for audiofic or “podfic”—record- ings of fans reading fan fiction stories aloud, similar to “books on tape”—in  2006.  Then,  in  the  late  2000s,  after  fans  began  to  sour  on  social  media  platforms as well as FF.net because of their censorial policies  which I will  describe in more detail in chapter 3 , a large body of fans gathered to found  the  volunteer-run  Organization  for  Transformative  Works,  whose  first  major initiative was to build the Archive of Our Own  AO3   figures 2.16  and 2.17 , a multifandom database designed and coded by fans and hosted  on OTW-owned  fan-owned  servers. AO3’s mission is to act as a “noncom- mercial and nonprofit central hosting place for fanworks using open-source  archiving software”  Archive of Our Own, “About the OTW” .  AO3 is now second only to FF.net in size, and is growing at a faster rate  than FF.net  see the conclusion for visualizations of both , and so is on track  to become the largest fan fiction archive online. Many of the fans that we  interviewed in 2012 regarded AO3 as already far superior to FF.net, regard- less of the relative sizes of the archives, because FF.net is for-profit and AO3  is not-for-profit; because FF.net has a reputation for hosting fic primarily  written by younger, “feral” fans; because AO3’s user interface was built by  fans for fans, and so offers better navigability and functionality  although  AO3 is still in “beta,” that is, many of its features are still under construction  and being tested ; and because FF.net has censored and deleted numerous  fans’ stories while AO3’s policy is to never practice censorship or deletion.  AO3 is thus currently building a strong reputation as the universal archive  for fan fiction.  So, media fans seemed to transition from a phase of highly centralized  archives  from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s  to a phase of decentralized  archiving in the early rush of social media  during the 2000s , and around  2007, the concept of a central archive—which AO3 explicitly calls itself— became dominant in fandom once again. This trajectory of  Centralization  mid-1990s to early 2000s   → Decentralization → Centralization   early-to-mid-2000s    late 2000s to present   over the years 1995 to 2012 certainly does not fit the history of every fan- dom, as fandom is not monolithic and each fandom has had its own history,  but almost all of the fans interviewed by my research team perceived this to  be the general arc of fan archiving. What comes through clearly from our  interviewees is that the desire for archives for fan fiction has persisted over  time, and that when the technologies and platforms have become popular  with fans but have not offered affordances for archiving, fans have found    94   Chapter 2  complementary  platforms  and  software  or  have  designed  new  platforms  and software to facilitate the construction of archives.   As my research team conducted interviews in 2012, before the platform  Tumblr   which  does  not  function  as  an  archive   became  such  a  promi- nent  host  for  online  fannish  activity,  it  is  difficult  to  say  whether  the  current moment is one of centralization or decentralization for fan archi- vists. Coppa states that Tumblr, as a nonarchive, and AO3, as the result of  decades of fans’ experimentations with archival forms, serve fans quite well  in combination: “Tumblr and the AO3 is becoming the new slash pairing  of fandom. … You post your link [to your fan fiction story] on Tumblr, and  then you read [the story] at the AO3 and then you do your pictures [on  Tumblr]. … They complement each other in ways that are really interesting  but we could not have imagined [at AO3]. There was no Tumblr when we  started designing this thing. And I don’t know that there will be a Tumblr  in  four  years.  But  we’ll  [AO3  will]  be  around  in  four  years,  or  ten  years”   Coppa 2012 .  The  drive  to  digitally  and  publicly  archive  absolutely  everything—at  least,  everything  within  certain  parameters,  everything  within  a  specific  genre—thus motivates fanfic archives as much as it does Project Gutenberg,  the Internet Archive, the Rosetta Project, Open Library, and Archive Team;  all universal archives and archivists demonstrate this impulse to acquire,  contain,  and  offer  all  information  that  matches  the  archive’s  declared  mission.   Universal  archives  appear  to  be  highly  disinterested  in  the  question  of canons. The idea of privileging some texts over others is alien to such  repositories. Plenty of people may be invested in discriminating between  the contents found in these capacious repositories: for example, in Internet  fandom,  individual  fans’  recommendation  lists,  usually  containing  titles  and descriptions of their favorite fan fiction stories with links to those sto- ries, is a popular type of fan site. Similarly, on the Internet Archive, the right  margin of each category, such as “Texts,” “Audio,” and so on, contains a  list of “Staff Picks.” But such expressions of taste will always be highly per- sonal, unique to each user, and the recommendations may change or rotate  frequently,  as  they  do  in  the  case  of  the  Internet  Archive’s  “Staff  Picks.”  Of course, taste leaders may establish themselves in any cultural arena— some fans’ recommendation pages receive thousands of hits—but universal  archives do not structurally, permanently prioritize any subgroup of texts  over the remainder of their contents. There may be some algorithmic cura- tion: the Internet Archive and Project Gutenberg both publish frequently  updated lists of their most downloaded files, and many fan fiction archives    Archival Styles   95  allow readers to see the number of “hits”  views  and “reviews”  comments  feedback  each story has received. Some users may choose to access certain  files because of their popularity.  But rather than investing any resources into positioning themselves as  the origin and ground for new, postprint “selective traditions,” universal  archives cultivate an image of impressive abundance. I think that universal  archives are far more invested in performing plenitude than in servicing  selection because so much selecting-out is already executed by the ephem- eral properties of digital data and the proclivity for forgetting in digital cul- ture. The propensity of data to disappear or to become unfindable, which  stems  simultaneously  from  technological  affordances  and  information  abundance, is so great that universal archives define victory as the accu- mulation of preserved data. The accumulation, the sheer quantity of files  saved and kept retrievable, is what universal archivists desire to accomplish  and to display. In volume lies their victory. There is no room for a selec- tive tradition of any kind—no shuffling of less popular works to basement  storage, no showcasing of special collections in the “best” room, no tacit  cooperation with tastemakers or cultural critics who wish to erect cultural  canons—in an archival repertoire so focused on fighting loss.  Fan Fiction Archives as Community Archives  The universal bent of early Internet fan fiction archives was simultaneously  an impulse toward community archiving: a central archive typically oper- ated in tandem with a single central mailing list, and together these com- prised the online “infrastructure” of a fandom, according to Coppa: “Before  [the 2000s], if you hit a new fandom [online], you knew what to do: you  went to the archive, you joined the mailing list. You plugged yourself into  the infrastructure”  Coppa 2012 . Universal archives can thus help a com- munity, especially a subcultural group such as a media fandom, to define  itself and locate itself; a central archive that aims to corral all of the stories  produced by a fandom in one site, like a central mailing list on which all  discussions and arguments within a fandom take place, can help a commu- nity by providing stable and easily located gathering places.  In such a centralized system, the culture of an online community can  be easily found, clearly identified, and quickly learned by every member  of that community. Central archives thus facilitate the integration of new  members.  Many  of  our  interviewees  spoke  about  how  they  used  central  archives  for  this  purpose,  to  “get  up  to  speed,”  so  to  speak,  with  a  fan- dom they had just joined. Te remembers that when she initially discovered    96   Chapter 2  slash fan fiction in 1997, “I read all of the slash that I could find that was  online at the time, in fandoms like [Star] Trek [NBC, 1963–1969] and X-Files  and Highlander [syndication, 1992–1998]”  Te 2012 . Litotease says of her  moment  of  discovery  of  Sentinel   UPN,  1996–1999   fan  fiction,  “I  found  this world and I could go crawl inside [it like] a book. … I love the long  fictions. I love the novel-like fictions. I like to go crawl inside a world and  not  come  out.  And  I  found  one.  And  it  was  amazing.  And  I  was  follow- ing  this  path  through  all  of  these  different—I’ve  read  all  of  the  Sentinel  stuff”  Litotease 2012 . via_ostiense remembers that when she first found  Harry  Potter  fanfic  archives,  “I  didn’t  really  know  anything  about  fic,  or  who the good writers were or anything like that, so I started with the let- ter A, going by author listings, and tried to just work all the way through  them”   via_ostiense  2012 .  From  her  first  years  in  online  fandom  to  the  present, Kristina Busse has had a ritual of reading every story housed in the  archives of each new fandom that she joins. For the Sentinel, Due South, and  X-Files fandoms in the 1990s, and more recently, for the Inception, X-Men:  First Class, and Bandom fandoms,6 she would either read alphabetically by  author, or “would start with the longest—you could sort them by length,  and I would start with the longest story—and then just read all of them.  … And, of course, you encounter someone who can’t write, and then, you  know, you like throw out all the stories by them. But on the whole, I would  really read every single story. And so … I would always say something to  people who’re like, ‘Well you can’t know that,’ and I was like, ‘I’ve actually  read the archive [of the fandom] comprehensively!’”  Busse 2012 .  Rather than regarding these stories of intense usage of central fic archives  as the behavior of media “addicts,”7 I read these stories as illustrative of how  deeply many media fans long for a sense of community, of not-being-alone,  of membership in a group that they were not born into but to which they  instantly feel they belong. Fan archives provide a sense of history and cul- tural memory to a fandom, and when newcomers join the fandom, they  familiarize  themselves  with  the  storytelling  conventions,  major  authors,  popular tropes, rituals, and argot of their new community by immersing  themselves all at once in the community’s archive, and consuming its cul- tural  texts  until  they  deeply  understand  the  fandom’s  workings  and  can  rightly consider themselves acculturated to the group. The process of read- ing quickly through a central fic archive is a crucial step in making oneself  into a member of that fandom. In fact, newcomers to a fandom who fail to  take this step—who do not take the time to learn the culture of the com- munity from its archives, and who contribute stories or participate in dis- cussions without a knowledge of the past, the traditions, the customs of the    Archival Styles   97  group—are often despised and derided as “feral,” a fannish term that con- notes childishness or immaturity, unsophistication, ignorance, and, most  importantly, a not- yet- belonging.  Thus, fan fiction archives demonstrate that Internet community depends  on infrastructure. The infrastructuring labor of fan archivists, and of techno- volunteers  in  similar  support  roles,  makes  possible  the  multiplication  of  affinity-based communities on digital networks. Early theorists of nascent  Internet  culture  such  as  Janet  Murray,  Allucquére  Rosanne  Stone,  and  Howard Rheingold drew attention to how chatrooms, MUDs and MOOs,  listservs and other platforms for discussion, debate, and storytelling could  facilitate  a  sense  of  affiliation  and  connection  between  individuals  who  were not necessarily bonded by shared geographies, ethnicities, nationali- ties, age, or economic class;8 Rheingold  1993  called these “virtual com- munities,” and participation in these types of social networks has become  a common practice for Internet users. But feelings of community are gener- ated by more than the everyday communications that transpire on social  media sites. Archives, full of the cultural content produced by affinity-based  online groups, and rich with those group’s cultural traditions, very often  serve as the mechanisms by which new members orient themselves to the  groups’ interpretive practices, expressive modalities, and preferred genres  of production. Deep engagement with the archives of Internet subcultures  gives  newcomers  the  cultural  knowledge  they  need  to  begin  producing  and  sharing  their  own  texts,  and  offering  informed  commentary  on  the  textual production of others—in short, to begin participating fully in the  subculture.  But  a  virtual  community  member  does  not  need  to  generate  content  for an online community in order to fully feel invested in, and a member  of, that community. Oral history participant Alexis Lothian  2012b  recalls  that, upon discovering fan fiction for the first time through a Harry Potter  fic archive, she experienced “a sense of belonging, even though I didn’t,  and never have actually, written much fiction. I still felt as if these were my  people.” In Lothian’s remarks, we see how powerful a role online archives  can play in Internet users’ lives: archives can provide users with a feeling  of having found a home and a “people” they can claim as their own  recall  Coppa’s phrase that KS Nicholas’s slash archive was “where you lived” on  the Internet during the years that it was active .  And  having  found  this  type  of  home  on  the  Internet,  new  members  may go on to add their own works to those communities’ archives, or they  may not; the immersion in the communities’ cultural productions imbues  them  with  the  feeling  of  homecoming  and  community  whether  or  not    98   Chapter 2  they become a cultural producer themselves. So-called lurkers in online fan  groups, who read fan fiction stories and discussions but do not post their  own stories or comments, may therefore feel the same degree of belonging  to the group, simply through their uses of fanfic archives, as fan authors  and fan reviewers feel. Lurkers and authors may not have the same social  status in an online community, but they may have the same cultural status,  in that they are both fully invested members of that community’s culture,  insofar as they are both deeply familiar with the community’s archives of  cultural production.  The importance that fans place on the feelings of belonging that they  receive from their engagement with fan fiction archives stems largely from  the  fact  that  these  archives  are  predominantly  queer  and  female  online  spaces. Chapter 3 will explore fanfic archives as a queer, feminist archival  tradition in detail. Here, to illustrate how fannish online communities and  archives  have  enabled  members’  fuller  exploration  of,  and  identification  with,  queer  and  female  perspectives,  I  will  simply  cite  a  few  oral  history  participants’ statements. Lothian says of her initial encounter with fanfic  archives: “I was reading slash and I was reading, well, sexually explicit fic- tions, and so there was … something really amazing about this outpouring  of sexuality and desire”  Lothian 2012b . Te recalls that when she initially  discovered a Star Trek slash archive, she felt struck by lightning: “Wham!  Here I am, finding authors like [redacted], and all of these other great, won- derful slash goddesses”  Te 2012 . Te emailed feedback to the first author  she read. “I was like, ‘Holy crap! This [is] amazing! This is the best porn I  have ever read. You’re awesome!’” When the author replied to Te, Te began  to understand that many women, not just the one author, were writing the  kind of “porn” that Te wanted to read. “I realize[d], ‘What the fuck? This is  a community of incredibly perverse women”  Te 2012 .  For  many  women,  it  is  a  powerfully  validating  experience  to  encoun- ter  storehouses  of  “pornography  by  women  for  women,  with  love”   as  award-winning science fiction author Joanna Russ [1985] called slash fan  fiction —to  find  repositories  of  cultural  production  by  female  authors  about nonheteronormative, or simply nonnormative scenarios of human  interaction   nonnormative  in  that  they  are  outside  the  bounds  of  what  Gayle Rubin [1984] calls “the charmed circle” [280] of acceptable gender-  and sex-related identities and acts for women, i.e., heterosexual marriage,  monogamy, childbirth and child-rearing, and other forms of family care .  The editors of The Feminist Porn Book argue, “The overwhelming popularity  of women’s erotic literature, illustrated by … the flourishing women’s fan  fiction community, … proves that there is great demand among women for    Archival Styles   99  explicit sexual representations. … Women-authored erotica and pornogra- phy speaks to fantasies women actually have, fantasies that are located in  a world where women must negotiate power constantly, including in their  imaginations and desires”  Taormino et al. 2013, 14 . Given how little the  cultural industries cater to women’s fantasies, and how rigidly mainstream  media texts keep women characters’ actions within the bounds of “norma- tive and constricted sexualities”  14 , it is unsurprising that female media  users have turned to new media to assemble archives of their alternative  versions of older media. Engaging with fanfic archives, queer and female  subjects derive a sense of community belonging, for the sheer preponder- ance of alternative cultural production that they encounter in the archives  informs them that, although they exist outside “the charmed circle,” they  are far from alone.  Like the FAMA Collection, SAADA, the Radfem Archive, and the Michi- gan Trans  Controversy  Archive,  fanfic  archives  work  to  save  and  “keep  alive” the shared sensibilities, experiences, thoughts, ideas, and expressions  of a group that does not find itself well represented in either mainstream  culture  or  traditional  memory  institutions.  The  texts  kept  by  a  commu- nity archive have definite, often profound, relevance to that community’s  members, and are often viewed as irrelevant, unimportant, or simply not  very interesting to nonmembers. However, most community archives wel- come use by nonmembers who wish to gain a better understanding of the  communities through engaging with their recorded cultures. Nonmembers  thus educated can become allies of those communities, who support those  communities’ various struggles without identifying as one of them  as, for  example, men can be allies of women’s movements, though they do not  identify  as  women,  and  as  non–Asian Pacific  Islander  Americans  can  be  allies of API movements, though they do not identify as API . Also, non- members  can  become  members  of  certain  communities,  such  as  fan  fic- tion and radical feminist communities, through their use of those groups’  online archives, by which they learn how to be members, and transform  their identities through that learning  changing their identities from not- fan to fan, or from not-feminist to feminist .  The majority of community archives are politically opposed to the con- cept of “canonicity,” as they typically refuse traditional notions of hierar- chy, status, and privilege, and regimes organized according to vertical logics  under which their members have suffered, or from which they have been  systematically  excluded  from.  Community  archives  encourage  users  to   draw whatever they need from their stores—to construct their own personal  canons from the collections, if they wish—and the archives themselves are    100   Chapter 2  not structured in ways that support the canonization of some items over  others.  In addition, I predict that no community digital archive will become a  dominant institution in the larger field of digital culture in the way that  the  Museum  of  Modern  Art,  the  New  York  Public  Library,  or  the  Library  of  Congress  are  dominant  cultural  institutions  founded  in  the  print  age,  or even in the way that the Internet Archive strives to be a dominant cul- tural  institution  in  the  early  digital  age.  New  media  have  facilitated  the  assembly  of  communities,  and  the  construction  of  community  archives,  that are small and specific, and that are “minor” in the sense proposed by  Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. These communities and their archives are  minor not because their concerns, commitments, and contents are minor,  but  because  their  concerns,  commitments,  and  contents  are  constructed  within a major culture.9 A single story about an individual that is written in  a “minor” language is always political, argue Deleuze and Guattari  1986 ,  because “a whole other story is vibrating within it”  17 . That is, the story  of the whole community, the whole story of a minor community, vibrates  within  one  story  of  a  lone  member  of  that  minority.  Because  a  “minor”  cultural production, within a “minor” culture’s archive, contains multiple  texts  that  each  contain  and,  in  some  sense,  represent  the  “whole,”  each  text is equally valuable and each such minor archive is as important as any  other. Or rather, each archive holds extraordinary importance, power, and  significance for the minority that it serves. Thus, the community archival  style refuses every permutation of canonicity.  Fan Fiction Archives as Alternative Archives  The question of quality often comes up when I present scholarly work on  fan fiction. Nearly every time I have given a paper at an academic confer- ence on the topic of fanfic, one or more audience members asks a variant  of this query: “But is any of it any good?” My response is: Many fan fiction  writers strive for a high degree of literary quality, not only mimicking styles  learned from established print authors but producing new kinds of experi- mental fiction. At the same time, many fic writers do not aim for literari- ness in the slightest, but are trying to produce entirely different types of  “quality” fiction.  In  our  interviews  with  fan  fiction  archivists,  writers,  and  readers,  we  noted a wide range of comments on the topic of quality in fanfic. Some par- ticipants emphatically stated their preference for “literary” fic over poorly    Archival Styles   101  written fic. For example, Litotease states that when she first began reading  online fic,  I  was  delighted  by  the  stories.  I  don’t  know  how  I  had  the  good  luck  to  stumble  across. … My very first stories [that I read] were exquisitely written. I didn’t trip over  the twelve-year-old writing Mary Sue fanfic. I tripped over [renowned Sentinel and  Due South fic authors] Francesca and astolat, at the very beginning. So, the world- building was phenomenal. The characterizations were true. One of the most amaz- ing things about Francesca as a writer is that she’d write the characters one way, like  [the reader will say], “Of course, that’s exactly how they are,” and then, just to play,  she will switch them. And I’ll read it and I’ll go, “Well, of course. That’s exactly how  they are.”  Litotease 2012   Like Litotease, nightflier makes a strong distinction between badly written  fic and literary fic, stating,  [The X-Files community was] the most amazing fic community I’ve ever seen. They  produced so much quality of every level from the worst—I mean, barely writing in  English, like, no grammar, no punctuation—I read stories that were like medieval  manuscripts  where  all  the  words  were  written  together  and  every  other  one  was  spelled wrongly. Like, I read fic written like that, and I read fic that was literature,  that I will be quoting lines from those stories to my dying day. It was so poetic and  beautiful and taught me so much about writing.  nightflier 2012   We can derive nightflier and Litotease’s criteria for distinguishing between  “good” and “bad” fic. Good fanfic is defined by: solid “world-building” and  “characterizations”;  experimentations  with  form  such  as  a  single  author  writing the same characters completely differently in two different stories   both versions being convincing interpretations of the characters ; “exqui- site” and “beautiful” writing, which sometimes takes the form of “poetic”  language,  rich  with  memorable  lines.  Bad  fanfic  is  defined  by:  immatu- rity or lack of sophistication in authorial voice  “twelve-year-old Mary Sue  fanfic” ; and poor grammar, punctuation, spelling, and formatting. Their  standards for good fanfic seem to match widely accepted standards for good  literary fiction.  But other interviewees defined “good” or “quality” fanfic differently, in  ways that had little to do with literariness. Or rather, they acknowledged  that  much  of  the  fanfic  they  enjoyed,  or  that  found  popularity  in  their  fandoms, was not “quality” fic. Julie Levin Russo recalls that many or most  femslash  female female  fanfic writers in the late 1990s did not seem par- ticularly interested in producing “literary” stories:  I  think  the  stylistic  emphasis  of  late-nineties  [femslash]  fanfic  was  very  much   influenced  by  romance  novels.  Or  there  are  maybe  two  genres.  So  one  was  just    102   Chapter 2  straight-out porn, you know, … like PWP [Plot-What-Plot]. Dirty fic. And then there  were these whole romance novels that people would write. There was a real emphasis  on the first-time story, like the saga of how two characters first got together. And  even after you got past the first time, I think in the lesbian romance novel tradition,  there would be constant obstacles that would come up in the relationship that the  characters would then have to overcome. … [It was fic] that was just very driven  by the id, and fic that was really oriented toward producing certain feelings, and it  didn’t really matter if it was well written and if all the punctuation was right. But  then also, I think, looking back at it now, you also have to cringe, too. Because a  lot of it is so bad. So you can both really enjoy reading it, and get caught up in the  story and the feelings and the erotic charge, and then also at the same time be really  uncomfortable with how bad it is. So I think that’s a unique pleasure of reading fic  that’s [more than] a decade old today.  And  I  think  that  [in]  my  later  experiences  [in  the  2000s]  in  LiveJournal  fanfic  communities, there was a much bigger emphasis on literary writing, and on show- don’t-tell, on carefully crafting prose. And on fan fiction as a sort of creative writing  exercise.  Russo 2012   Russo here acknowledges two kinds of “good” fanfic. One kind of “good”   or, we might say, effective  fanfic does not necessarily meet the standards  of literariness that Litotease and nightflier lay out in their above quotes, but  it succeeds with its readers because it delivers a certain affective experience,  often a libidinal and or romantic experience. The other category of “good”  fanfic that Russo establishes is “literary”: its authors adhere to the “show- don’t-tell” rule, “carefully craft” their prose, and seem to engage in fanfic  writing as a “creative writing exercise” rather than an exercise in conveying  affect. Russo speaks of paradoxically holding both sets of criteria for “qual- ity” in her mind when she rereads late-1990s femslash fic. She knows that  some of what she can “really enjoy reading” and “get caught up in” is also  “so bad,” and calls this peculiar  re reading experience “a unique pleasure.” Russo references the Freudian term “id” when she describes the category  of  effective affective  fanfic,  and  another  participant,  Kristina  Busse,  calls  this category of fan writing “id fic.” Busse says that when she first discov- ered fanfic, the first story that she read  was such—it was every cliché in the book. It was a Mary Sue, and it was … just—I  mean  it  was  just  horrible.  However.  However,  I  had  never  encountered  this.  …  I  think one of the things I love about kind of, what we would usually call bad fic, is  that it’s real id fic and so it hits all of those things that, you know, you don’t get  in real literature. You don’t even get [those things] in good fanfic. It hits all those,  all those things where you lie in bed and dream up whom you want to pair with  whom, and, you know, create these crazy scenarios. And that’s exactly the stuff it  was.  Busse 2012    Archival Styles   103  I  underscore  the  difference  between  “literary”  fanfic  and  “id  fic”  not  because I wish to claim those as the only two definitions of “quality” fanfic  that currently circulate in media fandoms—our interviewees spoke of an  astoundingly diverse range of fanfic genres, writing styles, and tropes that  they have found interesting, innovative, hilarious, compelling, entertain- ing, and otherwise “good”—but because I wish to illustrate that fanfic is an  alternative system of cultural production that has not, so far, been system- atically incorporated into either the world of “high” art or the commodity  categories of the “mainstream” culture industries, and that this nonassimi- lation is divorced from questions of quality.  On the one hand, there is online fanfic that meets the standards that  most literary critics would agree on for “quality” writing, and these stories  have not been recognized as “literature.” Fan fiction can be as “good” as  good  writing  gets,  and  yet  it  is  never  a  candidate  for  earning  the  desig- nations  of  either  “art”  or  “mainstream  culture”  because  it  is  subcultural  production, circulating in what John Fiske  1992  calls a “shadow cultural  economy”  30 . Fic is writing that originates from, and circulates in, vol- unteer-organized, affinity-based Internet communities rather than writing  that comes to the public’s attention through the funneling mechanisms of  print publishing and mass media. On the other hand, much fanfic earns  favor with fan readers precisely because it does not adhere to the definitions  of “quality” established by the art literary worlds and mainstream media.  Busse says that the pleasures of “id fic” lie in its provision of content that  “you  don’t  get  in  real  literature,”  and  that  “you  don’t  even  get  in  good  fanfic”  Busse 2012 . Readers and audiences do not often find the affective  charge of which Russo speaks in the offerings of either mass culture or liter- ary high culture. And there are many other types of fanfic whose value, for  appreciative readers, lie far outside the categories for aesthetic or concep- tual achievement learned from what Lewis calls “official culture” or what  Fiske calls “normal popular culture”  30 .  Thus, fan fiction archives must be called “alternative” archives, even if a  good deal of fanfic meets the bar of what the arbiters of “official” or “nor- mal” culture would call “good” writing. The path of literary fanfic to realms  of greater visibility and higher cultural capital remains “shadowy” at best.  Fanfic archives store “bad” fic as well as “good” fic, or rather that they store  fiction that might be received as “good” for any number of reasons—fic- tion that does not need to fulfill any requirements for “quality” writing set  out by the print publishing industry—and thus facilitate the development  of new reading tastes  such as Russo’s “unique pleasure” in badly written    104   Chapter 2  but  emotionally  and  affectively  powerful  fanfic ,  and  the  emergence  of  unexpected subgenres and styles.  Online fanfic archives thus resemble other alternative digital archives:  fic archives collect and preserve a fairly new, fast-growing genre of digital  culture, as does the ArtBase; fic archives collect users’ digital derivations and  appropriations of popular media that exist in a gray zone of legality, as does  Download Finished; most fic archives collect both “bad” and “good” texts,  as Sly collects both “badfilm” and “art film,” under the overarching ban- ner of nonmainstream film. As I will explore in chapter 6, fic archives also  collect and document “events”—online writing festivals, contests, battles,  exchanges, and other time-limited happenings designed to encourage fan  production—as does the Netbase. All of these alternative and avant-garde  archives are committed to corralling, preserving, and making broadly acces- sible digital material in new genres, “low” or derided genres, derivative  and  therefore, questionably legal  genres, and genres that resist categorization.  The contents of alternative archives have not  or, again, not yet  entered  into the canons of high or mass culture, and the archivists of these reposi- tories  do  not  seem  deeply  invested  in  forcing  that  entry.  Rather,  these  archives serve as countercollections, storehouses of culture outside highly  visible “official” cultures, from which users can construct their own canons  employing  curatorial  tastes  that  deviate  from  the  cultural  norm.  In  fan- dom,  “canon”  has  a  specific  meaning:  it  refers  to  the  “source”  texts  on  which fan works are based, so in a film fandom, the canonical text is the  film itself, and in a television fandom, the canonical texts are the episodes  of the TV series, and in a comic book fandom, the canonical texts are the  comic book issues. Fan production is always noncanonical, by definition.  This use of “canon” in media fandom parlance makes archives of fan works  anticanonical, in the sense that these archives refuse to allow the source or  canonical  works  to  remain  intact,  untouched,  complete  in  and  of  them- selves—these archives refuse to let canonical works form inviolable, closed  wholes.  Fanfic  archives  record  the  multitude  of  ways  that  users  open  up  canons, and revise, rework, interpret, and vary their contents.  And  fanfic  archives  are  also  anticanonical  in  another,  deeper  way.   Like  other  alternative  online  archives,  they  reject  the  “selective  tradi- tions” of both high art and mainstream media. They encompass marginal   and  emerging  forms  of  digital  making.  They  designate  the  deviant  and  subcultural  worthy  of  preservation.  If  cultural  canons  are  predicated  on   some common conceptions of artistic or literary “quality,” alternative digi- tal archives either utterly dismiss the question of quality or radically rede- fine quality.   Archival Styles   105  The Repertoire of Archive Use  As  cultural  production,  distribution,  and  consumption  increasingly  tran- spire on new media platforms, how does the seeker of culture proceed? How  does the seeker of culture know where to look, what to look for, what to  save and discard, and how to understand what networked society at large  is  saving  and  discarding?  What  seekers  of  culture  must  do  now  is  begin  to grasp the repertoire of archiving that has developed over the past forty  years,  and  to  take  the  initiative  to  create  their  own  repertoires  of  archi- val  use.  Digital  archives  rise  and  fall,  and  all  the  ones  I  have  named  in  this chapter may collapse in the next handful of years or decades. But the  impulse to found cultural archives, to save small or large swaths of culture  that one finds important, will continue and is only getting stronger in the  Internet population, so that if one looks, one will always be able to find  where culture is being “kept,” and in turn, one must decide how to “keep”  the texts, works, and artifacts that one finds in archives online. The digital  reduces  the  “canon”  to  an  individual’s  collection  of  material;  the  act  of  “canonization” becomes a constant, personal practice of searching, discov- ering, and consistently, actively preserving and reusing.  We  will  have  universal  archives  long  after  the  Internet  Archive  effort  comes to an end; we will see more and more community archives built in  the decades to come; and the tendency to create online spaces for emerg- ing and alternative genres will not diminish. Seekers of culture in the digi- tal age must be prepared to constantly quest for, and stumble upon, new  archives of these types. They must also become accustomed to experiencing  the frequent loss of archives—to watch archive after archive simply vanish  from the Internet—archives to which they have become attached.  Thus, the general repertoire of archive use that develops in tandem with   the repertoire of archive building is this:  1.  Be on the lookout for, and actively search for, the kinds of digital archives  you need. 2.  Know  that  there  are  universal,  community,  and  alternative  archives— which of these are you seeking, and for what type s  of content? 3.  Be  grateful  when  you  find  the  sort  of  archive  you  wished  to  find.  Be  appreciative of the volunteers who labor to keep those archives functional  and operational. 4.  Decide  what,  of  the  contents  you  encounter  from  these  archives,  you  want to save, and treasure. Copy these to your personal archive, your pri- vate  storage.   You  will  necessarily  develop  many  highly  individualized    106   Chapter 2  repertoires, of how to continually update and migrate and maintain your  personal  digital  collection,  following  this  step.   Anticipate  that  any  ser- vice you use to manage your personal archive may fold, that any server on  which you store your archive may degrade, and so you will likely have to  migrate your data again and again, over the course of your life. 5.  When your favorite Internet archives close, you will grieve, but you can  also  hope  and  even  expect  that  new  archives  are  likely  in  development,  as long as new techno-volunteers are signing themselves up for archivists’  duties. Return to step 1. 6.  Also, during any of the above steps, know that you could become a vol- unteer archivist. You could support an existing archive, save a dying one,  or found a new one. This is what repertoire means: all but the earliest vol- unteer  archivists  watched  others  do  archiving  before  they  opted  to  do  it  themselves, and they learned the “how” of rogue archive building partly  by copying the actions, styles, methods, and designs they witnessed others  performing and executing. So archive using can become archive building.  The two repertoires not only repeat across multiple bodies, but sometimes  merge in the same bodies.  The drive to archive has so far coalesced around these three styles—univer- sal, community-based, and alternative—but more modes of digital preser- vation may become prominent in the near future. What all of these archival  styles share is a quest to obliterate the “selective tradition” that served as a  dominant cultural logic of the print era.

Break 2  Archive Elves Break  Archive   2 Elves  The repertoire of digital archival labor—the steps taken by each person or  group who decides to construct an Internet archive from scratch—typically  consists of the following  as described to my research team by our inter- viewees : getting sufficiently motivated to launch the project, which usu- ally involves either feeling angry or scared that no archive exists for one’s  online  community’s  materials;  acquiring  server  space,  and  ensuring  that  the content one archives will not violate any of the server company’s terms  of service  which has led many archivists to purchase their own servers ;  designing  the  user  interface;  devising  a  system  for  intake  that  will  keep  up with the rate of submissions, which can be particularly difficult when  one  is  archiving  a  “live”  community,  that  is,  an  online  community  that  is constantly producing new material; dealing with the public, which can  mean handling cease-and-desist notices or other challenges from copyright  holders if one is archiving appropriative or remix-based content—but more  often means handling the queries and criticisms of archive users; manag- ing growth, usually in the form of recruiting assistance  additional techno- volunteers   when  necessary;  redesigning  the  interface  when  it  becomes  technically or aesthetically outdated; and backing up the archive regularly,  without fail.  This  repertoire  of  archive  building  demands  a  great  deal  of  archivists’  skill, time, and, in many cases, money  some archivists must add “fund- raising” to the above list , but tends to go unnoticed or misunderstood by  archive users. Some users mistake hacker pirate amateur fan-run archives  for corporate-funded and corporate-developed sites—thinking there is no  difference between, for instance, the Archive of Our Own  AO3  and Tum- blr, both of which host enormous amounts of fan activity, but only one of  which  Tumblr  is a for-profit business with engineers on staff—and they  assume  that  a  well-paid  full-time  team  is  constantly  available  to  provide  them  with  technical  support  and  service.  Some  users  know  that  teams    124   Break 2  of  volunteers  maintain  some  of  the  archives  they  use,  and  expect  those  volunteers to perform desired technical labor and fulfill user requests on  demand. It is likely that a significant percentage of Internet users simply do  not know for certain who or what creates or sustains the online platforms  that they use every day, and do not know that there is a substantive dif- ference between platforms owned and managed by corporations, govern- ments, and endowed not-for-profit organizations, and platforms designed  and run by hobbyists and not-for-profit organizations that must constantly  solicit funds or pay out of pocket to stay operational.  Henry  Jenkins  suggests  one  reason  that  the  work  of  networked  infra- structure-building may seem opaque to the millions who regularly interact  with the products of that labor: it is not online infrastructure, but online  community, that excites and engages people. “The platform companies no  doubt  would  love  us  to  say  that  we  are  participating  in  their  platforms;  they talk about the Reddit community or the YouTube community. Yet I  suspect  in  most  cases,  the  participants  do  not  understand  themselves  in  these terms at all. The participants in the Archive of Our Own understand  themselves as part of fandom”  Clark et al. 2014, 1465–1466 , rather than  as part of a platform, Jenkins argues. This viewpoint aligns with my descrip- tion  in chapter 2  of the importance that “community archives” have to  their members: such archives provide resources with which individuals can  form and strengthen their understandings of their identities, and experi- ence a sense of common identity with others. The details of infrastructure  ownership and support may matter little to community archive users.  What looms large for users is that online resources allow them to find  one another, and to feel a connection with one another. Archives provide  this connection through giving members of a community a sense of shared  culture.  What  makes  those  resources  appear  and  what  keeps  them  going  are questions that may simply not occur to most people who take part in  online communities. Even in the case of AO3, which was formed explicitly  by fans to be a fan-owned platform, members and visitors who were not  part of the early days of AO3’s organization may be ignorant of the archive’s  origins and mission, and how deeply its founders felt the need to create an  online space for fans over which no corporate interest could have control. Other  factors  contribute  to  users’  lack  of  awareness  of  network  work.  Sociologist Mauricio Lazzarato first proposed the term “immaterial labor”  in 1996  Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri [2000] adopted and popularized  the term in their book Empire  to describe, Lazzarato states, “the changes  taking  place  in  workers’  labor  processes  …  where  the  skills  involved  in  direct  labor  are  increasingly  skills  involving  cybernetics  and  computer    Archive Elves   125  control   and  horizontal  and  vertical  communication ”   Lazzarato  1996,  133 . Lazzarato also glosses immaterial labor as “the activity that produces  the ‘cultural content’ of the commodity,” consisting of “a series of activi- ties that are not normally recognized as ‘work’—in other words, the kinds  of activities involved in defining and fixing cultural and artistic standards,  fashions, tastes, consumer norms, and, more strategically, public opinion”   133 . By offering dual definitions of immaterial labor, Lazzarato attempts  to account for both the apparent “immateriality” of digital work itself, the  seeming nonphysicality  putting aside issues of hardware performance and  ergonomics   of  creating  infrastructure  and  communicating  with  and  via  computers, and the “immateriality” of the Internet content created by cul- tural workers, most of whom produce this content voluntarily and during  their “leisure” time, not under the rubric of “work.” Part of Lazzarato’s proj- ect is to emphasize that labor that appears to lack three-dimensional form  or that seems largely divorced from physical expenditure is nevertheless real  work. But the very “immateriality” of digital archival labor brackets it off  from perception, making it seem either nonexistent  the user does not ask  “Who or what makes this infrastructure possible?”  or not-work  the user  thinks that creating online cultural infrastructure is only fun and recreation  for the creators .  A  number  of  scholars  in  various  fields—Lazzarato   1996 ,  Tiziana  Ter- ranova  2004 , and Trebor Scholz  2013  in new media studies; Shannon  Jackson  2011  and Rebecca Schneider  2012  in performance studies; Hardt  and Negri  2000  in philosophy; Saskia Sassen  1991  in urban studies; John  Caldwell  2008  in media industry studies; Andrew Ross  2009  in cultural  studies; and Gregory Sholette  2011  in art criticism, to name a few—have  foregrounded the labor that produces the necessary infrastructure for cre- ative endeavors, pointing out how often such work is downplayed or dis- counted.  This  scholarship  makes  plain  how  often  those  who  do  creative  infrastructuring are depicted as invisible, even otherworldly, forces. In his  analysis of digital effects designers working on major Hollywood blockbust- ers at shops such as Industrial Light and Magic  ILM  and Pixar, Caldwell   2008  highlights the frequency with which digital cultural labor is charac- terized not as effort, but as “magic”: “No matter how complicated, intimi- dating, or overwhelming the behind-the-scenes picture of a studio back lot  or a computer-generated imagery  CGI  effects department may appear in a  making-of [video], the DVDs that include such things will typically explain  or  reduce  the  whole  undertaking  using  fairly  archaic  notions  linked,  for  example,  to  the  persistence  and  playful  ‘magic’  of  artists  and  medieval  alchemists”   21 .  Sholette  similarly  writes  about  the  people  who  support    126   Break 2  the art world but are not famous or renowned artists; these people might  teach  in  art  schools,  attend  art  shows,  and  purchase  art  journals  and  art  equipment. Sholette  2011  calls them “dark matter”  1 , an “army”  7, 16   of “invisibles”  3  who are “an essential component of the elite art world  whose pyramidal structure looms over them”—they form an unseen base  that props up the pyramid’s peak  3 .  Francesca  Coppa,  one  of  the  founders  of  AO3,  offers  another  way  to  think of those who work in support roles for digital creators and makers— behind-the-scenes and behind-the-screens, as it were—as magical entities.  In my interview with Coppa, she recounted what it was like to interact with  online fanfic archives in the mid-1990s, when a handful of workers had to  labor intensively to keep those archives running smoothly:  Archives, the way you would do it is, you would literally [e]mail your copy [of your  fan fiction story]—in other words, there was no automatic archive. You would have  to send your copy to a person, and that person would put the story up, they would  code—because nobody knew how to do HTML, you couldn’t just put your stuff up,  you didn’t have a website, it was all so primitive, you know? But you could email  your story to somebody, and they would put it on a website for you, and make it  visible, and code it up in certain ways. And [we] called those people “archive elves.”  …  And  so,  for  instance,  Highlander  had  an  archive,  and  the  archive  elves  would  manually put the stories up. And often, they would fall behind, and people would  complain. You know: “I sent you my story two days ago and it’s not up yet.” These  [archive workers] are people with lives and jobs! They were doing it voluntarily. Put- ting [the stories] on the line like laundry for you, you know?  Coppa 2012   Coppa here puns on the word “online,” stating that early fanfic archivists  put stories “on the line like laundry,” and thus compares digital archival  labor to routine, domestic, feminized labor that often goes unnoticed by  those who benefit from the work. Coppa implies that just as residents of  a household may think that freshly laundered clothes and linens miracu- lously appear, when laundering in fact requires someone’s time and energy,  so users of 1990s archives tended to think that their stories should simply  appear online, without considering that archivists had to devote effort to  marking up the stories in HTML before posting them.  One  can  detect  a  strong  correlation  between  Caldwell’s  magic  alche- mists, Sholette’s dark army of invisibles, and Coppa’s archive elves: all three  figurations of infrastructuring laborers relegate them to the status of unnat- ural, subhuman, or nonhuman actants, possessing impressive powers and  necessary  for  the  effectuation  of  important  actions,  but  operating  in  the  shadows of human creativity. The alchemists, invisibles, and elves are facil- itators  of  more  heroic  archetypes:  actors,  artists,  writers.  The  facilitators’    Archive Elves   127  creations make possible the creative work of others—but their supportive  productivity is regarded as wand waving and spell casting—the manifesting  of  supernatural  powers—rather  than  as  ordinary  human  industriousness.  Lazzarato’s  descriptor  for  digital  and  cultural  labor,  “immaterial,”  comes  to apply to the laborers themselves, as they are discursively translated into  disembodied forces and mystical, imperceptible beings.  In theater studies, a similar language is sometimes used to describe crew  members who labor backstage: Alice Rayner  2006  calls these workers “the  ghosts of theatre”  148  and “ghosts behind the curtains”  137 , who make  possible the “hallucinations of the onstage world”  142 . Backstage theater  work  is  far  more  material  than  digital  infrastructuring  labor  in  that  it  is  more obviously physical and the output is a live embodied event. But there  is something about digital archiving that invites comparison to a theater  production’s run crew. Something about the intangibility and invisibility  of Internet infrastructuring calls to mind the image of crewmembers shuf- fling around in the near-dark; both kinds of workers create the conditions  for entertainment without being seen. Digital archivists do much of their  work  at  the  “back  end”  of  archives,  as  technical  theater  workers  operate  backstage; the public that interacts with the “front end” of archives does  not, and is not meant to, see and understand all of what transpires at the  back end, just as the public that watches a play unfold onstage does not,  and is not meant to, see and understand all of what transpires backstage.  Digital archivists want users’ experiences of their archives to seem smooth  and  frictionless.  Archivists  think  that  it  should  be  as  easy  for  an  online  archive’s visitor to dip into the database as it is for a play’s audience to slip  into the “hallucination of the onstage world”  for the moment, I am setting  aside performance forms that strive to discomfort and disorient audiences  rather than envelop and immerse them . The smoothness of platform use  to which the majority of platform designers aspire requires the erasure of all  traces of the designers’ labor.  So, both archivists and users wish for digital archives to work as if by  magic. It is no wonder, then, that the effort of archivists goes unnoticed by  archive users: the nature of online infrastructuring is such that the infra- structure builders aim to make themselves and their work invisible, ghostly,  and immaterial. If using a networked digital archive feels like using a magic  memory machine, this is in part because both the server that stores data  and  serves  it  up  on  command,  and  the  servers   archivists   who  serve  the  archive users  on demand  and maintain the integrity of the archive, are  concealed from the user’s view.   128   Break 2  From my perspective as a theater maker who has worked far more often  backstage  or in the booth  than onstage, digital archivists seem much like  a technical theater crew, who move set elements around between scenes, or  operate sound, lighting, and video cues from somewhere behind the audi- ence, clad in black, in low lighting so as to go as unnoticed as possible. Both  digital archives and theatrical shows require a great deal of hidden human  activity to produce seamless flows of onstage front-end performance. Both  bring into being virtual spaces with which the public expects to interact  without suffering interruptions, delays, or barriers. In both cases, if the pub- lic can see you working hard to produce those effortless  in the public’s eye   interactions, you’re “doing it wrong.”  Again, I am momentarily neglecting  nontraditional performance forms that deliberately call attention to their  technical and backstage workings.   The comparison between digital labor and theatrical labor also helps to  reveal what we might call the nested aspect of immaterial labor: performance  artists and actors, like fan writers and other members of online communi- ties who provide immaterial labor, most often at the fringes of mainstream  society, themselves depend on large networks of people to allow their mar- ginalized operations to transpire and come to fruition. Rayner  2006, ix– xxxv   refers  to  this  nested  aspect  of  immaterial  work  as  the  “double”  of  artmaking; Jackson  2011, 177 , describing performance art events, states  that however “immaterial” these events may seem, they “still need a certain  kind of technical labor in order to exist.” Fans who create digital works in   as John Fiske put it  the “shadow” of official cultural texts rely on teams  of technically skilled people to publish, distribute, and preserve their cre- ations, who operate in the shadow of the fan creators. Immaterial laborers  do not work on their own, but within networks of production.  Like technical theater workers, rogue digital archivists do not typically  labor in the hopes of generating tremendous profits, either for themselves  individually or for the larger organization  the archive  that they support,  so they are not quite the “netslaves” that Terranova  2004  discusses in Net- work Culture, the volunteer intern moderators and Web designers recruited  by large Internet companies whose free labor allows publicly traded firms  to  multiply  their  stock  valuation   73–80 .   At  the  same  time,  it  must  be  acknowledged  that  all  fans  who  generate  online  content  indirectly  add  value to the media companies whose products they continually promote  by extending those products’ relevance.  Nevertheless, there can be a perni- cious tendency for everyone who benefits from the creative and technical  labor of back-end backstage workers to undervalue that labor, by regarding    Archive Elves   129  the workers as simply part of the machinery of production, as robots who  serve.  One fan, Morgan Dawn, spoke in her interview about the stresses that   archive users can put upon volunteer archive workers:  There’re these very weird preconceptions as to the people who are the drivers [of fan  platforms and fan organizations]. There are very few people who get off their butts  to do much of anything. And sometimes [the platform and organization builders]  are not the easiest people to work with. I mean, usually they’re not. But you have to  admire the fact, and respect the fact, that they’re getting shit done. And what you  have to do is find a way to work with them and that is not happening. …  It’s  more  about  the  ability  to  drive  away  people  who  contribute,  and  I’m  not  talking about writers and vidders. I’m talking about people who do the infrastruc- ture. A friend of mine is one of the people who works on the OTW [Organization of  Transformative Works, parent organization of the Archive of Our Own] systems. So,  … this is the person who runs the servers, okay? And the pressures that they’re being  put under, with the criticisms all being heaped upon them, is wearing them down.  And if you have individuals who are constantly under criticism, while they’re doing,  in my opinion, the most impossible shit, it’s going to be very, very, very difficult [for  those individuals] to maintain that kind of energy.  Dawn 2012   Morgan Dawn points out that, in the case of AO3, a nonprofit fan-made  archive whose early volunteers constantly struggled to bring online enough  servers to handle the archive’s rapidly rising demand, users sometimes treat  the  volunteers  like  servants,  venting  their  impatience  and  dissatisfaction  without  recognizing  the  impact  their  complaints  may  have  on  workers’  morale.  Chael, a lead archivist of the Gossamer Project  the major X-Files fan fic- tion archive , says that once, in response to users emailing to ask when the  next update was coming, and to register their disappointment that “fresh  stories” had not yet appeared on the site, he posted a testy message:  Hey, you guys always want to see the latest stories. We already have 10,000 great  stories on the archive. And while you are waiting, I’d prefer you go read those stories  rather than complaining. We are all volunteers. We don’t ask anything from you  to maintain this site. And we’ll get the stories out as soon as we can get them out.   Chael 2012   Soon afterward, Chael says, he posted a “more professional response,” which  stated that, going forward, the archivists would always announce a “Next  Update Date” so that users could anticipate when new work would appear  on the archive. Chael’s follow-up message, which focuses on logistics rather  than emotions, illustrates archivists’ belief that, although they are volun- teers, they should interact with their public as if they were professionals,    130   Break 2  present the archive as an efficient technical service, and resist any urge to  gripe to users about their occasional struggles with intake. However, archi- vists’ efforts to match or better the usability of commercial websites, and  to maintain a professional demeanor at all times, likely encourages archive  users to misinterpret their moments of being overwhelmed as technologi- cal glitches.  When users of digital archives conflate the mechanical servers and the  human servers, they participate in what Georg Lukács called “reification”   which Christian Fuchs notes is “a reformulation of Marx’s [1867] concept  of  fetishism”  [Fuchs  2012a,  697] .  In  a  process  of  reification,  “a  relation  between people takes on the character of a thing and thus acquires ‘phantom  objectivity,’ an autonomy that seems so strictly rational and all-embracing  as to conceal every trace of its fundamental nature: the relation between  people”  Lukács [1923] 1971, 83 . The relation between users and archivists  can take on the character of a thing—a memory machine—and the reifica- tion of the idea of fully automated digital cultural memory obscures the  fact that digital cultural memory does not have any rational “objectivity,”  but is a nascent concept in flux, being unevenly realized through relations  between people, in the work that archive builders do for archive users and  the constant negotiating that takes place between the two groups.  The states and quasi-state entities that sponsored the founding of archives  during the print era desired those archives’ reification; they benefited from  archives  being  taken  for  truth-collecting  and  truth-producing  machines,  for then narratives of state power, control, and hegemony were supported  by the totality of documents preserved, and were therefore unquestionable.  “It could never have been otherwise,” announce archives of the state. But  archiving in the digital era is not coupled with state power in the same way,  and it does not need to reinforce existing hegemonic structures to the same  degree. Therefore, the current generation would be remiss to reify archives,  to mistake them for machines whose operations are concealed and secret to  a large degree, and to again forget that humans in relation to one another  produce cultural memory. If users can perceive the human labor that under- girds digital cultural memory, then they can continue to question what that  memory is and what it should be, what narratives it does or should support,  and what power structures it endorses, questions, or facilitates.   3  Queer and Feminist Archival Cultures: The Politics of  Preserving Fan Works Chapter  Female   Archival   Queer   and   3 Cultures  I want us to own the goddamn servers. —Speranza  Women Fans against Male-Dominated Tech  What  motivates  digital  archivists  to  donate  the  labor  and  time  required,  often in vast quantities, to build and maintain their archives? Many archi- vists who spoke to my research team pointed to their fear of loss, their anxi- ety over digital ephemerality, and their suspicion that if they do not save a  community’s cultural works, those works will vanish entirely. For example,  Deirdre, a lead archivist of the Gossamer Project  the main archive of X-Files  fan fiction , recalls one prolific fandom from the 1990s whose works can no  longer be found online:  The sad thing is, … Babylon 5 was not a rare fandom. Babylon 5 was as popular [as a  source text for fan fiction] in ’97, ’98 as The X-Files was. [But] the archives collapsed  and vanished! … Everything is gone. … I know there was as much fiction being gen- erated in that fandom [as in X-Files fandom], and it is all gone. … One of the things  that has always prompted me to keep on with Gossamer, and to try to keep it going  and to try to keep it going the best [I] can, is because I watched a fandom disappear.   Deirdre 2012   However, a different set of motivations led to the formation of the Orga- nization  of  Transformative  Works  in  2007  and  the  Archive  of  Our  Own   AO3  in 2009, which is currently the fastest-growing multifandom archive  online. In the mid-2000s, a number of fans noted that significant transfor- mations were taking place in the workings of the Web, a set of changes that  gravely  threatened  the  types  of  communities  that  fans  had  been  forging  online since the early 1990s. When “Web 2.0” discourse rose to prominence  beginning  in  2004   O’Reilly  2005 ,  technology  firms  and  entrepreneurs    132   Chapter 3  began to show great interest in, and attention to, user-generated content  and  social  networks,  including  Internet  fandoms,  which  had  pioneered  many practices of online community, participation, and remix production  that rapidly became standard on the “social Web.”  On the one hand, social media corporations sought to impose restric- tions on what types of content were permissible to share online, leading  to  events  in  which  numerous  users  suffered  takedowns  of  their  content  without warning. One such incident was “Strikethrough 2007,” in which  Six Apart, the company that owned the blogging platform LiveJournal, sud- denly  deleted  hundreds  of  journals  containing  fan  fiction  and  other  fan  works because they contained what was deemed offensive sexual content.  Similarly, from the mid-2000s to the mid-2010s, the for-profit archive Fan- Fiction.net  FF.net  conducted multiple “purges,” deleting thousands of sto- ries that site moderators decided were too sexually explicit.1 On the other  hand, social media entrepreneurs aimed to build sites that would attract fan  fiction writers and turn their productions into financial profit—for the site  owners, not the fans and writers. The most notorious of these attempts to  monetize fan fiction was the short-lived company FanLib  2007–2008 ,2 but  in the mid-to-late 2000s, there were signs that additional attempts might  be made to corporatize fan fiction in ways that would not prove beneficial  to fans.  In my interview with her, Francesca Coppa describes the feelings about   Web 2.0 shared by many fans during this period:  [There was] a move away from a fan-owned, hacker’s, primitive Internet to a more  commercialized Internet. And that had repercussions, but nobody saw those until  the second half of the [2000s]. And then it became clear that we were then being  hosted on—like, Who the hell owns this [site]? Wait, where are we sitting? Who owns  this chair? I thought you owned this chair. No, I don’t own this chair. … You just felt like  every idiot who had [an idea that], I’m gonna make a million dollars on the Internet!  And I know what I’ll do, I’ll do something fannish and get all these fan girls working for  me in some way. … Classic Web 2.0: You make all the content, we’ll take all the money.  … Obviously, FanLib was the big one there. But there were others. You felt like there  was always some—somebody’s just gone and squatted on Fandom.com, somebody’s  gone and taken Fanfiction.com, Yourfanfiction.com—and you would think, What  the heck are they planning? …  And I have to say there was a gender piece of it, the sense that, like, some dude  was going to come and make millions off of us. … I remember some of us talking,  and saying, “It’s not even that they’re gonna make millions and give us some great  service.” Like, our bigger fear was some idiot, who had really no sense of what he  was doing or what the community was doing, was going to build something and get  everybody on it, and collapse [it] in two years. Ah, this isn’t so profitable. And just shut    Female and Queer Archival Cultures   133  the thing down. And in fact, we were afraid that might [happen] already with some  of  the  [social]  networks  that  we  were  beholden  to.  And  there  was  nothing—and  there is nothing—to stop LiveJournal from saying, You know, it just isn’t that profit- able. And folding up the tent. And so we never really had a fannish infrastructure  that was so dependent on people who didn’t care at essence about the activity they  were hosting.  And so when the Strikethrough issue [happened], and Fanfiction.net was purging  adult fiction semiregularly, … there was a whole sort of way in which you really felt  that the infrastructure started to feel a little bit fragile.  Coppa 2012   After  Strikethrough  and  FanLib,  the  prominent  fan  Speranza   writing  in her LiveJournal, cesperanza.livejournal.com  issued this “battle cry” to  online fan communities: “I want us to own the goddamn servers”  Busse  2009 . She and other fan leaders worked to raise awareness of the need for  fans to own and manage their own Internet infrastructure, and to actively  preserve  their  communities’  works  without  interference  from  for-profit  corporations  unfamiliar  with  fans’  community  and  cultural  priorities.  In  response  to  these  calls  to  action,  a  large  group  rallied  to  form  the  OTW  as  “a  nonprofit  organization  established  by  fans  to  serve  the  interests  of  fans  by  providing  access  to  and  preserving  the  history  of  fanworks  and  fan culture in its myriad forms”  Organization for Transformative Works,  “What  We  Believe” .  The  OTW  developed  AO3  to  be  “a  noncommercial  and nonprofit central hosting place for fanfiction and other transformative  fanworks, using open-source archiving software.” The OTW also founded  Open Doors, another conservation effort that focuses on “at-risk fannish  projects,”  such  as  fanzines  and  online  fanfic  archives  that  are  in  danger  of disappearing because of hosting companies closing down, or archivists  passing  away   Organization  for  Transformative  Works,  “Our  Projects” .3  The projects run on servers owned by OTW, purchased with funds donated  by users  all news regarding the state of the Archive of Our Own’s servers is  tagged “servers of our own” on the AO3 site .  The majority of members of fan fiction communities are women, and  reflecting and drawing upon their constituency, OTW and all of its proj- ects, including AO3, have been brought into being by women coders. In  2009, Alex Skud Bayley delivered a keynote address at the O’Reilly Open  Source Convention  OSCON  about the need for open source communities  to recruit more women. The two majority-female open source projects to  which she pointed, as examples to the rest of the open source field, were  Dreamwidth, a blogging platform built by fans as an alternative to Live- Journal in the wake of Strikethrough, and AO3. Bayley related quotes from  some of the women developers who had joined these efforts, who spoke    134   Chapter 3  of  how  welcoming  of  women  contributors  both  projects  were,  and  how  willing they were to train beginners  Bayley 2009 . One volunteer devel- oper told Bayley, “Deep down, I had always assumed coding required this  kind of special aptitude, something that I just didn’t have and never would.  It lost its forbidding mystique when I learned that people I had assumed  to be super-coders  surely born with keyboard attached!  had only started  training a year ago. People without any prior experience! Women! Like me!  Jesus! It’s like a barrier broke down in my mind.” As a result of AO3’s wel- coming attitudes, writes fan scholar Kristina Busse, the archive offers not  only “some of the things most of us would like to see in terms of accessibil- ity, search functions, tagging, etc. but in the process teach[es] fans to code  and to teach others to code”  Busse 2009 . AO3 thus increases the likeli- hood of women having the skills to participate, voluntarily and or profes- sionally, in technical communities.4  AO3 emerged from a conscious effort on the part of women fans to open  an archive that would be designed, operated, and managed at every level,  from mission to code to interface, by members of their communities. While  AO3 is singular in that it was deliberately founded as a reaction against the  maneuvers of male-dominated corporate entities in the early years of Web  2.0  in Coppa’s [2012] phrasing, “there was a gendered piece” of the OTW  effort,  which  was  to  prevent  “some  dude”  from  “com[ing]  and  mak[ing]  millions off of us” , other fan archives, predating and postdating AO3, have  shared AO3’s mission of safeguarding women’s cultural productions.   I argue that all fan-built fan fiction archives function as women’s com- munity archives. I also regard these archives as queer community archives,  as I will explain below. In establishing AO3, female fans collectively made  explicit their shared need to preserve the works that represent and express  their common interests, experiences, and identities; but in my view, all fan  fiction archives have been fueled by that need, even when it has gone unar- ticulated. These archival projects are motivated not only by a fear of losing  content to digital ephemerality, but also by a need to reinforce a sense of  collectivity among the women and LGBTQ-identifying people who popu- late fan fiction fandoms. Fan archiving is driven by a political longing: a  longing to protect and sustain female and queer communities and cultures.  Archives as Counterinstitutions  In chapter 2, I explained that fan fiction archives fulfill the functions of  all three major types of rogue digital archives: they are, at once, universal  archives,  community  archives,  and  alternative  archives.  But  my  research    Female and Queer Archival Cultures   135  team’s  interviews  made  clear  that  the  community  aspect  has  proved  the  most crucial to the people who have built, maintained, contributed to, and  or used online fan fiction archives for many years.  One of the greatest political potentials of rogue digital archives is that  groups that have occupied the margins of “mainstream” society, and have  consequently  been  largely  marginalized  by  traditional  memory  institu- tions, can build their own robust cultural memory sites, as something like  counterinstitutions, akin to the “counternarratives” told by postcolonial,  ethnic, and feminist writers who archontically rewrite the stories of domi- nant  culture   I  discuss  this  concept  in  more  detail  in  chapter  7 .  Rogue  archives transform “the museum,” “the library,” and “the archive,” which  have long supported, and been supported by, the state or private capitalists,  into supportive infrastructure for groups whose histories and cultures are  constantly in danger of being overwritten, forgotten, deleted, or relegated  to dark corners by the guardians of “official” history and culture.  In myriad ways, Internet fan fiction archives serve as critically impor- tant community archives for female and queer cultural creativity. Because  a great deal of fan fiction consists of sexually explicit content written by  women for women, and because female sexual expression is heavily limited  by sociocultural norms, fan fiction archives are sites in which women and  girls can feel that they are participating in a tradition of female writing and  reading, and can experience a sense of safety in numbers. In addition, fan  archives are queer archives, in part because of the volume of stories located  on these sites that are about male male, female female, and other romantic  and sexual  and also, aromantic and asexual  pairings and groupings that  diverge from the social norm of male female coupling, and in part because  of the large number of self-identified queer fans who use these sites, but  also  because  fan  archives  facilitate  numerous  acts  of  representation  and  communication that exceed the bounds of heternonormativity.  The Moment of Discovery  One of the strongest themes that emerged in my research team’s interviews  with fans was their strong and positive affective response when they first  found online fan fiction archives. I will call this initial encounter, described  by so many interviewees, the moment of discovery. Alexis Lothian, remem- bering her moment of discovery, which took place in 2003 when she stum- bled upon Harry Potter fan fiction, says, “I loved it. I was incredibly—it was  exciting. … Definitely it was a very visceral excitement”  Lothian 2012b .  nightflier  states  that  her  moment  of  discovery,  which  was  the  first  time    136   Chapter 3  she came across the Gossamer archive in the late 1990s, “was like a revela- tion.  I’ll  never  forget  that  day”   nightflier  2012 .  eruthros,  using  similar  terminology as Lothian, recalls that she “sort of stumbled into some sort of  online fandom, I think it might have been Due South first, and the Due South  mailing list … and archive,” and says that “thirty seconds after I found the  archive I found slash fandom and decided that was pretty awesome, and I  wanted to be there”  eruthros and thingswithwings 2012 . oxoniensis also  employs the metaphor of “stumbling” to characterize her moment of dis- covery, with Lord of the Rings fan fiction, in 2002: “My first contact with  fan fiction was an accident. I’d never heard of fan fiction, either by word  of  mouth  or  online,  so  it  was  all  rather  a  surprise  when  I  first  stumbled  across it. … Some stories were moving, some funny, some incredibly hot,  some utterly gripping. And to be able to find this all just by searching the  Internet was wonderful”  oxoniensis 2012 . oxoniensis says she feels “very  nostalgic” about “those heady first days of discovery.” Like Lothian, eruth- ros, and oxoniensis, Robin Nelson remembers her moment of discovery as  happening by chance. “It was pure accident,” says Nelson  2012  of finding  a Usenet group dedicated to Anne Rice fan fiction in 1996 or 1997. “I didn’t  know that fanfic even existed at that point. … I was actually thrilled. I was  elated.”  Participants gave a variety of reasons for their instantaneous affection  for fan fiction archives, but a common theme was the feeling of being not- alone, of being suddenly a member of a community, at the moment of dis- covery. As indicated by the above quotations, many fans had never known  of the existence of fan fiction before “stumbling” across a fic archive, and  thus had always felt isolated in their acts of what I call archontic produc- tion—the  appropriation  and  transformation  of  existing  narrative  worlds.  These interviewees said that this feeling that they were alone in practicing  transformative creativity was dissipated by their encounter with fan fiction  archives. “I think the overarching emotion,” Lothian  2012b  says of find- ing Harry Potter fan fiction, “was the sense of getting away with something.  … Because people are … thinking of this stuff, and they’re actually writing  it down. And I know this is a common emotion among fans, this sense that  you’ve … been kind of telling these stories, or sort of expanding on uni- verses that you’ve been reading about in your head, for your whole life, as  I had, and then you discover that people are doing this and sharing it, and  they’re building a community around it.”   Robin Nelson  2012  similarly recalls that one of the reasons that she  was “thrilled” at discovering the Anne Rice fan fiction newsgroup was that  “I did the same thing in my head. I had done that for years. Since I was a    Female and Queer Archival Cultures   137  kid. I had always read books and then my favorite ones, I would make sto- ries up about in my head.” When she found the newsgroup, Nelson says,  “I felt like for the first time, that it made sense. That other people did that,  too. I always thought I was really weird.” Victoria P.  2012  remembers that  when she first found an archive of fic based on the television show Homi- cide: Life on the Street, “I read the first couple of stories I thought were good,  and  went,  OKAY.  I  GET  IT  NOW.  Because  I  had  always  made  up  stories  about my favorite characters in my head—Mary Sue stuff,5 sure, but also,  just, what happened next and who got together, etc.” Thus, one of the fore- most  pleasures  experienced  by  fans  upon  first  encountering  Internet  fan  fiction archives was the pleasure of realizing that a solitary activity could be  a group activity, that they were not alone in inventing original stories about  borrowed characters. Lothian  2012b  describes feeling transgressive  “get- ting away with something”  at her moment of discovery, and Nelson  2012   describes feeling relief  “I always thought I was really weird” before find- ing fanfic ; these both suggest a transition from secrecy to nonsecrecy. The  secret production of fan fiction, which had always been limited to the con- fines of their imaginations, turned out to be a secret that could be shared.  Lothian reads this secret-sharing as an entrance into a kind of conspiracy,  in which many fans were all “getting away with something” together, and  Nelson reads this secret-sharing as a reassurance that she was more normal   less “weird”  than she had previously thought.  The size of online fan fiction archives  which I explore in the conclu- sion —the  number  of  stories  housed  on  these  sites,  and  the  number  of  authors who contributed them—gave Lothian, Nelson, Victoria P., and oth- ers a “sense of belonging,” a feeling of recognition  “I GET IT” , and the  security of knowing that they were not alone. In other words, if these sites  had not been archives, had not immediately given the impression of being  well-stocked repositories, trafficked by many writers and readers, then they  may not have not have communicated to fans the same aura of safety— safety in numbers, safety in being among like-minded individuals, safety in  standing with others.  One might say that any online community that one joins can give the  same impression of being not-alone, and that it is not necessarily the archi- val format that creates a sense of safety. While that is true, there is a special  attribute of archives that gives fans a feeling of being situated within some- thing larger than themselves: archives allow users to access the documents  that constitute the cultural tradition of a community. Archives allow users  to develop an understanding of what cultural texts the archive’s commu-   138   Chapter 3  nity has produced over time. In other words, archives are the bearers of the  history and memory of a community.  The Emotional Power of Archives  One of the primary motives of community archivists, especially those that  aim  to  collect,  preserve,  and  make  accessible  the  texts  and  ephemera  of  people  who  have  been  structurally  denied  social  and or  political  power,  is  to  incite  positive  feelings  in  those  who  identify  as  members  of  those  marginalized groups. Writes Joan Nestle  1990 , a founder of the Lesbian  Herstory  Archives   LHA ,  “One  of  our  battles  was  to  change  secrecy  into  disclosure,  shame  into  memory”   90 .  Theorists  of  archives,  taking  into  account the wave of community archiving that has grown steadily since the  1970s, also stress the importance of the feelings produced in those whose  documents are archived, and those who access those documents through  the archives. Achille Mbembe  2002  states that the archive “is supposed  to belong to everyone. The community of time, the feeling according to  which we would all be heirs to a time over which we might exercise the  rights of collective ownership: this is the imaginary that the archive seeks  to disseminate”  21 . Jeanette Bastian  2003 , in her study of the archives  of the Virgin Islands, writes, “The development of bodies of records pre- served and valued by communities over time suggests that the keeping of  archives goes beyond the need to account for the past and speaks to other  felt needs within the communities themselves, the primary one being that  of a community  or national  identity.” Bastian calls for “recognition of the  profound emotional as well as historical value of records” to the identity- building of groups, such as former colonies, whose identity is in question   Bastian 2003, 6 .  In An Archive of Feelings  2003 , Ann Cvetkovich makes a strong case for  the importance of archives’ emotional effects, and for archives that store  emotions. Cvetkovich  2003  describes “the profoundly affective power of  a useful archive, especially an archive of sexuality and gay and lesbian life,  which must preserve and produce not just knowledge but feeling”  241 .  Cvetkovich’s concept of “an archive of feelings” refers to a multisited queer  archive—one composed not just of brick-and-mortar community archives  such as the LHA but also of cultural texts “as repositories of feelings and  emotions, which are encoded not only in the content of the texts them- selves but in the practices that surround their production and reception”   7 —and this broad archive, a version of which Cvetkovich assembles in her  book, not only evokes feelings of identification and compassion in its users    Female and Queer Archival Cultures   139  but serves to record and communicate queer feelings as well, that is, “the  many forms of love, rage, intimacy, grief, shame, and more that are part of  the vibrancy of queer cultures”  7 .  Nestle, Mbembe, Bastian, and Cvetkovich all describe ways that commu- nity archives are heavily charged with affect, and that a successful archive,  a “useful archive,” in Cvetkovich’s phrasing, incites powerful emotions in  their users. The emotions that these theorists imagine community archives  instilling include: the feeling that one belongs to a collective and is therefore  not alone in her feelings, in whatever feelings that common positionality or  identity incites in her; the feeling that the history of one’s group warrants  remembering,  and  that  the  social  memory  or  collective  memory  of  that  group is deserving of being sustained and passed on; and the feeling that,  if institutional and official archives ignore, or fail to recognize, the value of  the group’s documents, that the group itself does honor and treasure those  documents. “The very existence of these independent archives provide evi- dence  of  just  how  much  has  been  excluded  [from  official  archives]  and  the professional practice [of archiving] that has been responsible for such  exclusions,” state Andrew Flinn and Mary Stevens  2009, 17 .  The  excitement,  recognition,  and  belonging  that  fans  feel  when  ini- tially  encountering  fic  archives  are  the  very  feelings  that  archivists  and  theorists claim are the intended affects imparted by community archives.  Nestle writes about how the LHA has fought to “change secrecy into disclo- sure”; this phrase describes exceedingly well what Lothian and Nelson went  through when they realized that their secret habits of archontic production  did not have to be secret any longer, but could be shared with others—per- haps  becoming  a  collective  secret  practice  instead  of  a  solitary  one.  The  sheer number of stories contained in fic archives, and the number of people  participating in those archives, communicates to fans that, even if fan fic- tion  is  rarely  recognized  as  a  proper  literary  or  artistic  genre  by  cultural  gatekeepers  both industrial and academic , at least fans archive their own  communities’ cultural texts and, in doing so, assert that fans’ productions  have cultural value and are worth preserving.  The feelings of finding themselves not alone, but part of a community of  fans, and part of a tradition of fan fiction writing, is part of what drives fans  to immerse themselves in the fiction of the first archives they find. cofax7   2012  states that immediately after she discovered X-Files fanfic on ATXC,  Gossamer, and the Annex  an archive of novel-length X-Files fic , “I read an  enormous amount of X-Files fan fiction in a very short period of time. I got  totally overwhelmed by it.” Gigi Morgan  2012  reflects on the period of  time that she spent reading fanfic right after finding her first fic archive: “It    140   Chapter 3  does become much more consuming for that period. You really do want to  read every fan fiction that strikes your interest and, you know, just kind of  … forget about everything else for a little while.”  Why  do  fans  tend  to  read  archives  so  comprehensively  upon  initially  discovering them? Most fans would probably say that they are simply desir- ous  of  consuming  as  much  cultural  production  as  possible  that  focused  on an interest of theirs—that they are left “wanting more” by the source  text, and are so pleased that to find that fellow fans have written stories to  expand the story universe that they dive headlong into the fic, simply to  get through as much of the longed-for storyworld as possible. Plenty of fans  likely feel that the pleasure they take from immersing themselves in nar- rative worlds is what motivates them to plow through fan fiction archives  at first: they enjoy committing themselves fully to source texts  commer- cially produced novels, films, television series, video games, manga, anime,  and  so  on ,  for  example,  by  reviewing  these  texts  and  closely  analyzing  them, learning the trivia pertaining to the texts, and so on; thus, fans might  say, it is logical that when they initially come across fan texts, they find  themselves committing fully to those, as well. By this line of reasoning, the  internal proclivity for devoting what N. Katherine Hayles  2007  calls “deep  attention” to cultural productions, which leads people to be fans of media,  is what leads them to also be fans of fan fiction.  I  perceive  another  motivation  in  fans’  comprehensive  reading  of  fic  archives,  which  is  fans’  need  to  absorb,  in  a  short  amount  of  time,  the  cultural memory of a group—that is, a fandom—into which they were  in  many cases  not born or raised, but with which they identify, and to which  they  feel  they  belong.  Going  through  the  backlog  of  stories  housed  in  a  fan fiction archive quickly confirms for fans the feelings that I discussed  above,  the  feelings  of  being  not-alone,  of  discovering  a  community  that  one instantly recognizes as, in some way, one’s own. In other words, the  experience  described  by  fans  is  that  of  learning  that  a  community  exists  to  which  one  instinctively  feels  she  is  already  a  member.  The  process  of  immersing oneself in a fic archive all at once also enables the fan to instruct  herself in a history, and a literacy, of archontic production for which she  may  feel  an  innate  affinity,  but  of  which  she  had  no  prior  knowledge.  Reading all of the stories that have already been written, prior to the fan’s  arrival, helps to educate her in the tropes and themes that are prevalent in a  particular fandom’s writing, which in turn informs the new fan about how  the fandom has been processing the source text over time. New fans take in  the cultural memory of the group in order to transform themselves into full  members of the group, with some understanding of how the group engages    Female and Queer Archival Cultures   141  with the source text and transforms it, and in order to continually reassure  themselves, with each new story they read, that they have indeed found a  group that is rich in the types of cultural production and practice that they  formerly thought could only be done in secret and in solitude.  The  fact  that  so  many  fans  “stumble  upon”  fan  fiction  archives— that  they  never  suspect  the  existence  of  fan  fiction  before  finding  these  archives—indicates that fan fiction is missing from the archives of main- stream culture. Fans do not encounter printed books of fan fiction on the  shelves  of  bookstores  or  of  libraries;  fan  fiction  is  not  regularly  a  part  of  school curricula and is not often the object of academic study. Therefore,  when fans discover fan fiction archives, they respond to them and utilize  them  as  community  archives,  as  the  repositories  of  the  cultural  memory  of a group that has been largely ignored by institutional archives, by high  culture or what Lisa Lewis  1992, 2–3  terms “official culture,” and by com- mercial popular culture. The absence of fan fiction from what I am calling  the  archives  of  mainstream  culture  leaves  people  hungry  for  knowledge  and training in the tradition of archontic production centered on media  texts. Thus, they tend to rapidly consume all of the texts they find in the  first archives they discover, because they long for exposure to, and educa- tion  in,  a  tradition  that  they  never  knew  from  official  cultural  archives,  but which they recognize as a tradition to which they are rightful heirs.  I  acknowledge that these experiences of discovery described by our oral his- tory participants may be historically specific. People who are now teens or  younger may grow up with a high level of new media literacy and a deep,  innate understanding of digital remix and online versioning, and therefore  may regard fan fiction archives and communities as intrinsic components  of their media landscape, not as new worlds to be discovered.   Andrew  Flinn   2007   defines  community  archiving  as  “the  grassroots  activities  of  documenting,  recording  and  exploring  community  heritage  in which community participation, control and ownership of the project  is essential”  153 . Flinn is interested in how digital network technologies  have made possible new kinds of community heritage projects that “take  place on the web with connections to … shared identities made by a virtual  community in a virtual space. Some of the digital material created … might  be artificial or ephemeral, but nonetheless it represents an important fur- ther source of material whose long-term preservations requirements need  to be explored.” Internet fan fiction archives fit Flinn’s description of com- munity archives in the digital age well: these archives are built by people  who have a “shared focus … [or] interest”  153 , they are grassroots efforts  that understand themselves to be solely beholden to their own members    142   Chapter 3  and not to any institutional archives, and they exist to house digital mate- rial, which challenges fan archivists to be inventive with their preservation  strategies. But the term “community archives” carries connotations beyond  Flinn’s basic parameters.  Gender and Sexuality in Fandom  Above,  I  stated  that  community  archives  are  often  founded  by  and  for  subordinated  groups  that  feel  that  their  histories  have  been  historically  excluded  from  institutional  archives.  I  propose  that  fan  fiction  archives  are  community  archives  that  similarly  safeguard  the  cultural  memory  of  groups left out of the official archives of culture. Fan fiction archives are,  de  facto,  archives  of  women’s  and  girls’  culture,  as  the  majority  of  their  contributors and users are female: in a 2003 survey of 1,000 participants in  a slash fan fiction online community, only 26 people, or 2.6 percent, self- identified as male  rushlight75 2003 ; in a 2013 survey of 10,005 fan fiction  writers and readers conducted by the Archive of Our Own, only 417 peo- ple, or 4 percent, self-identified as male  Lulu 2013 ; in the much smaller  sample constituted by the participants in our oral history project, only 3  of 50 participants, or 6 percent, self-identified as male. Thus, fan archives  definitely do the work of valuing and preserving a genre of gendered cul- tural production that is, for the most part, overlooked or derided by the  male-dominated  media  industries.  According  to  a  2013  Celluloid  Ceiling  study supported by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and  Film, women working in the television and film industries in 2012 consti- tuted 9 percent of directors, 15 percent of writers, 20 percent of editors, 2  percent of cinematographers, and 25 percent of producers; 38 percent of  films employed 0 or 1 women in these roles  Lauzen [2013] and Newsom  and Lauzen [2013] . Women are not the majority of authors of mass media  texts,  so  they  make  themselves  the  authors  of  fan  texts  that  rewrite  and  revise media texts.  I interpret female fan authorship as a response by women and girls to  a media culture in which they rarely see their own narrative priorities and  preferences  play  out,  and  so  feel  compelled  to  create  their  own  versions  and  extensions  of  film,  television,  music,  game,  and  comic  culture.  It  is  the very exclusion of female narrative desires from the archives of culture,  in  other  words,  that  motivates  women  and  girls  to  write  fan  fiction  and  to create their own archives for their archontic productions. As Francesca  Coppa  2012  says in her interview, women are “just sort of accustomed  … to watching movies for the middle. Or watching movies for particularly    Female and Queer Archival Cultures   143  emotive  parts.  Because  kind  of  inevitably,  the  arc  of  the  [film]  would  be  awful  or  disappointing  or  exclusionary”  for,  and  to,  women.  “So  you  watched in this kind of selective way for the great bits in the middle. And I  think fandom is all about the great bits in the middle. And we sort of trash  the end. There’s something female …, it’s that we almost don’t do endings.  Or we end, we start again. And I think there’s a suspicion the ending’s not  going  to  go  well  for  us.”  Coppa  offers  the  view  that,  because  the  major- ity  of  mainstream  media’s  plot  arcs  and  character  development  trajecto- ries do not cater to women’s interests, do not give female audiences what  they would want, do not valorize female perspectives, and do not promote  female-centric narratives, female fans must resource the “great bits in the  middle” that they like, the parts that deliver what they desire from media,  and  use  these  bits  to  form  female  texts.  The  subset  of  archontic  produc- tion that is fan fiction writing is largely driven by female imperatives. In  this statement, I am echoing Adrienne Rich’s 1979 statement on women’s  writing: “Re-vision—the act of looking back, of seeing with fresh eyes, of  entering an old text from a new critical direction—is for women more than  a chapter in cultural history; it is an act of survival”  Rich 1986, 33–49 .  For Rich, archontic production is a necessity for women; if women want  to see themselves in the texts that they consume, they must re-see, that is,  re- en vision, or re-vise, those texts. Fan fiction archives are thus archives of  women’s culture—of cultural products that women make, and of ways that  women interact with the culture that surrounds them and yet often does  not represent them in ways that women recognize or want.  Fic archives also have missions similar to queer archives, in several ways.  Fic archives facilitate a “change [from] secrecy to disclosure,” as described  above,  a  process  crucial  to  many  members  of  queer  communities.  David  Wojnarowicz   1991   writes,  “Each  public  disclosure  of  a  private  reality  becomes something of a magnet that can attract others with a similar frame  of reference”  121–122 , and fic archives help individuals who thought they  were “really weird”  in the words of interviewee Robin Nelson  or all alone  in their fannish proclivities realize that they can belong to, and participate  in, publics  or semipublics  built around those very proclivities. Fic archives  provide  newcomers  with  access  to  cultural  resources  that  help  them  ori- ent themselves within a group with which they immediately identify. Fic  archives reassure their members, through the numbers of stories and the  number of people assembled on and in archival sites, that there is an entire  culture that they can claim as their own.  But how is it possible to compare fan communities to queer communi- ties, and fan archives to queer archives? Fans are, after all, not marginalized,    144   Chapter 3  oppressed, or targeted by laws or policies or prejudices in the same way that  LGBTQ individuals and groups are; fans are not the victim of hate crimes  or  of  structural  sociocultural  oppression.  To  be  sure,  there  is  a  streak  of  fan discourse that employs the language of queer cultures. Some fans talk  about  being  “closeted,”  that  is,  careful  to  conceal  their  fannish  practices  from others; some discuss their “coming out” to friends and family when  they  decide  to  publicly  own  their  fannish  identities  and  activities;  some  report “being outed” against their will by other fans, sometimes acciden- tally, and sometimes maliciously—their fannish pseudonyms exposed and  their fan fiction stories circulated to their employers or coworkers or family  members.   Queer scholars have not been uncritical of what can be perceived as fans’  appropriation of queer frameworks. John Edward Campbell  Jenkins 2011a   has asked fan scholars “to be a bit more reflexive about comparisons of fans  to sexual minorities,” as the consequences for identifying publicly as a fan  are typically far less severe than for identifying publicly as LGBTQ. “There  is a way that sexual minorities growing up in this society must constantly  police their behavior, their tastes, their gestures, even their subtlest glances  to conceal their difference from mainstream society,” Campbell writes; in  contrast, fans do not have to police or conceal themselves in the same way,  to the same degree, facing the same possibilities of ostracization and con- demnation. In high school, Campbell states, “While I was very open about  my love for all things Star Wars since seeing the first film, I was utterly silent  about my love for men, even to myself. Being a fan of Star Wars was cool.  Being different was dangerous”  Jenkins 2011a .  Next to Campbell’s resistance to drawing an equivalence between “fan”  and “queer,” I will place Henry Jenkins’s  HJ  and Cynthia Jenkins’s  CJ   thoughts, shared in their joint interview, on the way that the fan identities  and queer identities sometimes “parallel” one another:  HJ:    I’m  not  unsympathetic  to  [Campbell’s]  critique.  But  I  think  it  also  doesn’t  acknowledge some of the very particular stories that I’ve run across through years  in  fandom  where,  in  fact,  the  parallels  are  very,  very  strong.  Because  reading  and  writing fan fiction is so bound up with sexual fantasies and sexual identities for most  hard-core fans. We hear stories of wives who don’t dare tell their husbands they read  and write stories, and end up lying about going to cons and deceiving them about  that aspect of their lives. Or husbands who prohibited their wives from having their  fan friends over when they’re not there. I’ve heard of stories of parents who either  destroyed all the zines or threw the kid out of the house because they found fan sto- ries that had erotic content or just because they were fans.   Female and Queer Archival Cultures   145  CJ:   Or the classic, “Oh my God, when I die, they’re going to go through my stuff”  stories.  HJ:   Yeah, half the fans I know have stories of who’s going to clear out their zines  after  they  die  before  their  parents  or  their  husbands  or  their  children  go  through  and find what it is they read. And that stuff is bound up with … To my mind, [the  experiences of being queer and being a fan] are not so far removed. If all you mean  is, there’s a little social embarrassment because you like Star Wars, and half the planet  likes Star Wars, then no, there’s not a parallel. If your ability to conduct your personal  life is directly affected by people’s perceptions of your fantasy life, because of things  they read in relation to your identity and desire, then that is a kind of queerness.  Jenkins and Jenkins 2012   Henry  and  Cynthia  Jenkins  are  here  discussing  zine-  and  con-based  fan- nish practices  “cons,” or fan conventions, are real-world events in which  fans  gather  to  discuss  their  favorite  texts,  sell  and  buy  fannish  products,  potentially wear costumes related to their fandoms, and otherwise celebrate  their fannish identities and communities , rather than practices based on  the construction and use of online fan archives. But the stories they tell of  fan lives bearing some resemblance to queer lives—of fans being secretive,  guarded, or evasive about these practices for fear of their family members  finding  them  out,  or  of  being  policed  by  family  members  as  to  whether  and  to  what  extent  they  can  engage  in  these  practices—were  echoed  by  our oral history participants, all of whom are Internet fans. Many of the  conflicts that fans experience either in their private domestic spheres, pub- lic  spheres  such  as  their  workplaces  and  larger  professional  networks,  or  the “semipublic”  Michael Moon, quoted in Berlant 2008 and Cvetkovich  2003  spheres of Internet fandom, arise from fans’ writing, or comment- ing  on,  fan  fiction  with  sexual  content.  Above,  I  referred  to  the  various  “purges”  that  FF.net  has  initiated,  including  an  especially  deep  purge  in  June 2012, which deleted approximately 8,000 stories containing textual  descriptions of physical actions that FF.net’s moderators judged to be too  explicitly sexual or violent  Ellison 2012 . Even fan fiction archives are not  always the safe spaces that fan authors and readers hope they will be.  The  disclosure  of  one’s  sexual  fantasies,  or  of  the  relationships  and  acts that one enjoys eroticizing, or of the degree of eroticism  on the scale  of “soft-core” to “hard-core” sexually explicit writing  that one favors, has  led  to  censure  and  censorship,  in  the  experiences  of  many  fans.  Not  all  Internet fan fiction contains sexual content, but because it is easier to find  erotic fiction in fic archives than it is on the shelves of most bookstores  and libraries, one of the aspects of online fic archives that fans value most  is that they constitute a kind of female public sex culture. I am borrowing    146   Chapter 3  here from Cvetkovich  2003 , who writes of a “lesbian public sex culture”  being constituted by “a print culture of books about sex, consumer stores  such as Good Vibrations and Toys in Babeland that are as much commu- nity centers as  thriving  businesses, performance cultures, and sexual sub- cultures organized around an increasing proliferation of sexual practices”   35 . Fan fiction archives are analogues to many of the objects that Cvet- kovich lists as constituting a lesbian public sex culture, as fic archives have  an electronic publishing culture of stories about sex; are as much sites for  communal  activity  as  they  are  repositories  to  be  accessed  by  individual  users;  are  performance  spaces  and  performance  cultures   as  I  will  discuss  in chapter 6 ; and contain a great deal of content that explicitly describes  sex acts, content that is informed by “an increasing proliferation of sexual  practices.” A number of fan scholars point to the liberatory potential, as  well as the risks, that attend participation in female public sex cultures, and  designate such cultures as both “female” and “queer.”  Catherine  Tosenberger   Jenkins  2011a ,  directly  responding  to  Camp- bell,  marks  the  difference  between  “affirmational  fannish  spaces”  and  “transformational fannish spaces.” Affirmational fannish spaces, in which  fans assemble trivia or facts, discuss minutiae pertaining to the source text,  and  otherwise  investigate  what  the  source  text  offers  without  seeking  to  alter  or  contradict  it,  are  “often   not  always,  but  often   majority  male.”  “Transformational fannish spaces,” such as fan fiction and fanvid commu- nities and archives, in which fans collectively rewrite and revise the source  text,  “are  more  likely  to  be  majority-female,  and  overtly  queer  or  queer- friendly.” “Transformational fans were also likely to be treated as an even  more pathological form of the pathologized fan,” writes Tosenbeger of early  academic studies of media fans: “those fan boys fighting about the engines  on the Enterprise might be hopeless geeks, but at least they’re not perverts  writing gay porn about Kirk and Spock!” Like Henry and Cynthia Jenkins,  Tosenberger  locates  the  queerness  of  fan  fiction  in  its  preponderance  of  sexual and erotic themes. “I think it’s really important to point out that  particularly in transformational fandom, sexuality, and fan production as  a means of exploring and articulating sexuality, is a big deal—this is espe- cially true for younger fans, whose expressions of sexuality are so heavily  policed in institutional settings,” Tosenberger states  Jenkins 2011a .  Tosenberger’s  highlighting  of  the  “policing”  of  sex-related  expression,  particularly  by  young  females,  in  public  spaces,  and  of  the  routine  deri- sion by academics of transformational  i.e., “majority-female, and overtly  queer or queer-friendly”  fannish spaces, calls for an understanding of fan  archives  as  spaces  that  offer  fans  shelter  from  censorship,  mockery,  and    Female and Queer Archival Cultures   147  shaming  spaces in which it is the “norm” for female and queer people to  share writing on diverse sexual themes with and for one another —and at  the same time, she implies that such spaces make fans perceptible to non- fans, and therefore render fans susceptible to ridicule and condemnation.  Fan archives thus can function as explicitly queer spaces do, as simultane- ously “safe spaces” and spaces of targeting.  Tosenberger also points out that many fan fiction authors and readers  self-identify as queer. “In slash fandom, … the majority of slashers identify  as somewhere on the queer spectrum, myself included,” Tosenberger writes   Jenkins 2011a . In 2010, a fan named melannen analyzed ten polls con- ducted over seven years on fan fiction sites  predominantly hosting slash  content  that asked participants how they identified their sexuality. Count- ing as “straight” “any poll answer that was straight, heterosexual, primar- ily heterosexual, heteroflexible, or [the] direct equivalent,” and counting  as “queer” “everybody else, including people who identified as bi-leaning  straight, questioning, and asexual,” melannen found that between 37 per- cent and 84.5 percent of respondents to all ten polls self-identified on the  queer spectrum; the median percent of queer respondents was 59.7 percent  and the mean was 60.8 percent  melannen 2010 . melannen’s conclusion  was that “the majority of slashers identify as queer,” which she feels must  be widely understood within fandom in order to advance fan discussion  around  “how  straight  women’s  sexuality  interacts  with  queer  sexuality,”  and other important topics around sexual identity and fan production.  The  2013  Archive  of  Our  Own  survey   analyzed  by  Lulu   mentioned  above, which garnered responses from 5,709 slash readers and 2,765 cre- ators   writers,  vidders,  etc. ,  similarly  found  that  only  31.7  percent  of  respondents identified “solely as female” and “solely as heterosexual,” with  remaining  respondents  identifying  either  as  “partially  female,”  “partially  heterosexual,”  or  both;  these  results  prompted  numerous  fans  to  affirm  Tosenberger’s and melannen’s assertions that a significant portion of online  fan fiction writers and readers self-identify as queer: “Evidence suggests that  it is worth questioning the assumption that all or most M M fans [fans who  read and or write fiction about male male pairings, called “slash fiction”]  are heterosexual women,” wrote a fan named Lulu  2013 , in a Tumblr post  summarizing the AO3 survey results. “It boils down to this, Slash fandom  is a goddamn queer majority demographic. … Read it, breathe it, own it. Slash  fandom is and always has been a queer community,” wrote another fan,  Suaine  quoted by sublimeglass 2013 , also citing the AO3 poll. Among the  participants in our oral history project, who were not all slash fiction writ- ers or readers, 23 out of 50, or 46 percent, self-identified as queer  inclusive    148   Chapter 3  of terms such as “bisexual,” “ambiguous,” “hetero queer,” and “sapiosex- ual” . In addition, several of our interviewees said that they participate in  fan fiction sites in part because they regard these sites as queer spaces. For  example, eruthros states in her oral history interview, “The whole time I’ve  been  in  fandom,  I’ve  been  in  fandom  because  I  was  queer.  And  because  there wasn’t a lot of queer fic or conversation or whatever happening in  other spaces”  eruthros and thingswithwings 2012 .  Thus,  Internet  fan  fiction  archives  serve  as  queer  spaces.  I  agree  that,  as Campbell points out, an individual who publicly claims the identity of  “queer” is vulnerable to legal, medical, and sociocultural discrimination to  an extent that an individual who declares him- or herself to be a “fan” is  not  although, as the Jenkinses state, fans are not exempt from identity- based disciplining and repression . But even though “fan” is not equivalent  to “queer” in legal medical sociocultural discourses, fan archives are queer  archives. I make this assertion not only based on the counts of queer users  of fan archives generated by the archives themselves  the Archive of Our  Own 2013 survey and the ten polls analyzed by melannen  and by my own  study, but also based on the ways that fan archives “count” in the lives of  fans,  both  straight  and  queer.  Here  I  am  building  on  the  work  of  Alexis  Lothian, Kristina Busse, and Robin Anne Reid, who deem online slash fan- dom “queer female space,” on Alexander Doty’s idea of “queer reception,”  and on Jack Halberstam’s and Cvetkovich’s thinking on queer archives.  Fan scholars Lothian, Busse, and Reid  2007  write, “For us, slash fandom  has become a place where a young urban dyke shares erotic space with a  straight married mom in the American heartland, and where women whose  identity  markers  suggest  they  would  find  few  points  of  agreement  have  forged erotic, emotional, and political alliances.” While asserting that slash  fandoms are usually “dominated by middle-class, educated, liberal, English- speaking,  white  North  American  women,”  the  authors  declare  that  their  personal experiences in slash fan fiction communities, and the testimonies  of the slash fans that they quote in their essay, “suggest there is something  interesting, and queer, going on here”  Lothian, Busse, and Reid 2007, 104 .  They contend that online slash fan fiction sites facilitate “forms of radical  intersubjective contact”  105 , bringing women of diverse sexual identities,  geographic locations, and family constructions into intimate connections  with one another.  One fan, Cat, quoted by Lothian, Busse, and Reid states, “For me, what’s  interesting about the eroticism of fandom isn’t the erotic content in general  but its communal nature and the way sexual activities and proclivities on  the fringes of ordinary acceptability are considered quite normal”  106 . It    Female and Queer Archival Cultures   149  is not just male male or female female sex acts being depicted in fan fiction  that makes fan fiction archives queer female spaces, in other words; it is  the communal play with boundaries and borders that fannish sites permit,  which Cat describes as “a continual negotiation of who we are and how we  constrict ourselves”  108 . Lothian, Busse, and Reid quote a number of fans  who are uneasy with the expansion of the term “queer” to include such  play, which can be interpreted as a shallow “playing-at” being queer that  blithely appropriates a sexual minority’s scripts, and they also cite fans who  imagine that some fans who self-identify as straight might “be involved in a  queer community queer writing and object strenuously to being described  by that term”  109 . Nevertheless, because fans, queer and straight, congre- gate in online fan sites in order to collectively produce and consume “slash  products that … can be queer in their content …—many of them in ways  more profoundly transgressive than simply containing m m or f f relation- ships,” states a fan named T., this type of Internet space “provides room  for people to queer their identities. Queerness isn’t a mandate here—it’s an  open possibility”  109 .  What  comes  across  clearly  from  the  group  of  fans  that  participated  in Lothian, Busse, and Reid’s study is that online slash fan fiction spaces  have  real-life,  real-world  consequences  for  their  participants,  whether  or  not those participants identify as queer, because in these spaces, fans can  question  and  defy  prohibitions  and  policing  on  their  own  imaginations,  identifications, and intimacies. It is fan sites’ actual effects on fans them- selves,  rather  than  the  virtualized  fictions  of  same-sex  encounters,  that  make  these  queer  female  spaces.  Lothian,  Busse,  and  Reid  again  cite  T.,  who says, “When I think of the exuberance I felt participating in fandom, I  think it was at seeing women stepping forward to describe their own erot- ics,  because  our  culture  silences  female  desire  as  effectively  as  it  silences  queer desire”  106 . In his oral history interview, Henry Jenkins speaks to  this silencing: “In my mind, the whole point of queerness is to talk about  nonnormative sexualities”  Jenkins and Jenkins 2012 . If we consider how  thoroughly most females’ fantasy lives are constrained by heteronormative  imperatives, then we can see how necessary and enjoyable queer spaces,  such as Internet fan fiction archives, might be for many women and girls,  as  they  offer  the  opportunity  to  explore  concepts  of  sexuality,  romance,  friendship, and other types of connections that fall outside of dominant  social regulation and policing, in numbers that provide participants with a  sense of safety for their creative practices.  But while Lothian, Busse, and Reid write specifically about online slash  fandom as a “queer female space,” I propose that all Internet fan fiction    150   Chapter 3  archives—which I define broadly as sites where users can access multiple  fan fiction stories, including individuals’ online journals—are queer female  spaces, regardless of whether they contain same-sex content. Female expres- sions, articulations, preferences, priorities and desires are lacking in pub- lic  discourse  generally,  and  in  mass  media  texts  specifically—particularly  highly erotic and sexualized expressions. Female fans “queer the [source]  text” in specifically sexual ways when they write stories about intercourse  between two male characters or two female characters, or stories about non- normative erotics such as BDSM  bondage, domination, sadism, and mas- ochism ,  incest,  polyamory,  and  nonconsensual  sex.  As  Jack  Halberstam  writes,  many  male female  sexual  scenarios  can  be  read  as  queer.  Writing  about the interplay between superhero Batman and antiheroine Catwoman  in  the  1992  Tim  Burton  film  Batman  Returns,  Halberstam   1992   states,  “When they [Batman and Catwoman] encounter each other in costume,  something much sexier [than what Halberstam, earlier in the essay, calls  “vanilla sex”] happens. … To me their flirtation in capes looked queer pre- cisely  because  it  was  not  heterosexual:  they  were  not  man  and  woman,  they  were  bat  and  cat,  or  latex  and  rubber,  or  feminist  and  vigilante.  …  Just because Batman is male and Catwoman is female does not make their  interactions heterosexual. Think about it. There is nothing straight about  two people getting it on in rubber and latex costumes, wearing eyemasks,  and carrying whips and other accouterments”  11 .   Similar  to  Halberstam’s  argument  that  male female  character  pairings  can  “look  queer”  is  Alexander  Doty’s   1993   claim  that  users  of  cultural  texts need not identify as queer in order to engage in what he calls “queer  reception”: “Queer positions, queer readings, and queer pleasures are part of  a reception space that stands simultaneously beside and within that created  by heterosexual and straight positions. … Queer reception is often a place  beyond the audience’s conscious ‘real-life’ definition of their sexual identi- ties and cultural positions—often, but not always, beyond such sexual iden- tities and identity politics, that is”  15 . Doty states that he doesn’t “want to  suggest that there is a queer utopia that unproblematically and apolitically  unites straights and queers  or even all queers  in some mass culture recep- tion area,” because “queer reception  and production  practices can include  everything from the reactionary to the radical to the indeterminate”  15 .  Following  Doty,  I  assert  that  queer-identifying  and  straight-identifying  fans  often  interpret  mass  media  texts  queerly,  and  create  queer  versions  and  variants  of  the  texts  they  use—and  rather  than  thinking  that  these  interpretations  and  versionings  take  place  in  a  purely  theoretical  “recep- tion space” or “in some [hypothetical] mass culture reception area,” I can    Female and Queer Archival Cultures   151  state definitively that these actions of queering take place, with great fre- quency and in high volume, on specific fan websites and online archives. I  do not regard the “areas” in which fans collectively queer texts as “utopic,”  “unproblematic,” or “apolitical.” Rather, fan websites and online archives  are real queer spaces populated by people who identify across a broad range  of  genders  and  sexualities,  which,  like  all  real  queer  spaces,  are  rife  with  internal and external conflicts and are highly political.   In addition to engaging in what Doty calls “queer positions, queer read- ings, and queer pleasures,” female fans queer themselves when they identify  with male characters in heterosexual narratives, writing and reading about  male  heroes’  feelings  of  romantic  affection  for  female  characters.  Female  fans queer female characters each time they depict a specific fictional woman  or girl as more empowered, more self-determining, more dominant than  she is in the source text—in short, placing her in the position of centrality  and  mastery  typically  assigned  to  male  characters.  Female  fans  engage  in  queer relations by writing sexual or romantic fiction specifically for fellow  female fans, for the purpose of intentionally turning other women on, or  at the least, fulfilling those women’s desires to be temporarily transported  into an imaginary that is highly charged with libidinal energies. Whichever  of these acts women and girls perform when they make and consume fan  fiction, they are all acts of queering.  Thus, Internet fan fiction archives are queer female spaces, because they  are  spaces  in  which  women  explore  myriad  alternative  ways  of  feeling,  being,  sexing,  doing,  and  communicating,  and  thereby  resist  or  defy  or  transgress what Adrienne Rich  1986  called “compulsory heterosexuality.”  Internet fan archives facilitate multiple genres of female narrative interpre- tation and creation, multiple modes of female relation, and multiple regis- ters of female affect, desire, and sexual identification, all of which exceed  the boundaries of compulsory heterosexuality.  The Work of Queer Archives  Halberstam  2005  and Cvetkovich  2003  detail the significant work that  queer archives do. Halberstam states that “the notion of a [queer subcul- tural] archive has to extend beyond the image of a place to collect material  or hold documents, and it has to become a floating signifier for the kinds  of  lives  implied”  by  the  archive’s  contents.  “The  archive  is  not  simply  a  repository; it is also a theory of cultural relevance, a construction of collec- tive memory, and a complex record of queer activity.” The queer subcul- tural archive, in other words, is a record of “queer history in the making”    152   Chapter 3   169–170 . Halberstam allows us to perceive fan archives as sites that not  only  store  fan  productions,  but  also  record  the  transformations  of  fan  groups’ “cultural relevance” and “queer activity”—their impact on main- stream media and nonfannish media users, and their ways of communicat- ing  and  creating  that  mark  their  differences  from  the  mainstream—over  time. These archives testify to the various “kinds of lives” lived by members  of these queer subcultures in different historical periods, and enable a larger  understanding of fans as actors in “queer history.”  Cvetkovich  characterizes  queer  archives  as  focused  on  preserving  the  “intimate  and  personal,”  and  consisting  of  objects  “collected  according  to sentiment and emotion,” “materials that archive emotion and feeling,”  “in contrast to institutionalized cultural memory”  269 . “In the absence  of  institutionalized  documentation  or  in  opposition  to  official  histories,  memory  becomes  a  valuable  historical  resource,  and  ephemeral  and  per- sonal collections of objects stand alongside the documents of the dominant  culture in order to offer alternative modes of knowledge”  8 , Cvetkovich  writes. This privileging of feeling and sentiment in queer archives also takes  place in fan archives, as fans are often defined  primarily by their detrac- tors  by the strength of their emotional responses, positive or negative, to  source texts. Also, fan fiction stories are themselves “materials that archive  emotion  and  feeling”—each  story  bearing  traces  of  what  its  author  felt  about a particular mass media production. Affective experiences and invest- ments  that  are  excluded  from  traditional  cultural  memory  institutions— powerful feelings that, when publicly manifested by queer individuals or  by individual fans, can be interpreted as “too much” emotional demonstra- tion—are prioritized and carefully preserved by alternative cultural mem- ory institutions. Cvetkovich implies that queer groups have a felt need for  the expressions of their feelings to be acknowledged as culture, as valuable  productions worthy of saving, if only by their own members for their own  members; I argue that fan groups feel the same. Both groups would claim  that their preservationist efforts are rooted in “the fierce conviction of how  meaningful and palpable these alternative life worlds can be,” and are moti- vated by “the fear that they will remain invisible or be lost” owing to their  ephemerality  166 .  Cvetkovich also explicitly brings queer archiving and fan archiving into  alignment when she discusses the importance of popular culture “reception  and  fandom”  among  queer  communities.  She  writes   in  alignment  with  Doty  that, for decades, the “ostensible heteronormativity” of celebrity cul- ture and pulp fiction has been “queered by the machinations of reception  and  fandom”   252–253 ,  and  that  therefore,  films  and  pulp  novels,  and    Female and Queer Archival Cultures   153  processes of viewing and interpreting and “camping up” popular culture  that are documented in queer art and performance works, must be included  in the lesbian archive of feelings. In assembling archives of transformative  acts of media reception, Cvetkovich states that fan archivists lead the way  for queer archivists to follow:  I take the fan as a model for the archivist. The archivist of queer culture must pro- ceed like the fan or the collector whose attachment to objects is often fetishistic,  idiosyncratic, or obsessional. The archive of lesbian fandom and fantasy would need  to  include,  for  example,  pinup  photos,  gossip,  film  clips,  and  other  memorabilia  that serve as the material evidence of fan culture. The fan cultures that queer certain  stars or the use of pulp novels as an indication of the existence of homosexuality  are historical practices whose story is not wholly told by the objects and persons in  and around which these forms of reception take place. … In the archive of lesbian  feeling, objects are not inherently meaningful but are made so through their signifi- cance to an audience.  253–254   Cvetkovich views the fan “as a model for the [queer] archivist” because fans  have collectively generated deep knowledges around how objects are made  meaningful by audiences’ interpretations and attachments, how to collect  objects that come to have fetishistic or deeply emotional significance for  individuals and groups, and how to build and sustain such collections. I  stated above that despite the fact that “fan” and “queer” are not equivalent,  fan  archives  are  queer  archives.  Viewing  the  link  between  queerness  and  fandom through Cvetkovich’s lens, we can rephrase my earlier statement:  queer  archives  are  frequently,  at  least  partially,  fan  archives.  Both  queer  and fan groups grasp the power of appropriating and transforming received  cultural texts, and therefore, any archive that hopes to adequately represent  either queer or fan sensibilities must archive queer and fannish archontic  productions.  Necessary Archives  Fan  archives  must  be  regarded  as  having  consequence  and  relevance  for  both fans and for larger society, in the way that community archives—par- ticularly queer archives—do, because they are “safe spaces” for nonhetero- normative practices, and because they safeguard fans’ histories of affective  experiences and transformative productions, which are histories of explora- tions of, and experimentations with, possibilities  including possibilities of  sexual identifications, desires, and fantasies  that are not recorded or docu- mented anywhere else. As many queer archivists, fan archivists, and com- munity archivists would argue, society benefits when, rather than seeking    154   Chapter 3  to suppress or eliminate minoritarian, marginalized, and nonmainstream  cultures,  it  strives  to  perpetuate  these  cultures;  according  to  the  logic  of  inclusiveness, the importance of these groups’ cultural memory institutions  must be acknowledged.  At the same time, the cultural productions of queer and marginalized  groups, when archived, can lead these groups to be clearly marked, identi- fied, and targeted for various types of exploitation and repression—and the  same  is  true  of  the  archived  productions  of  fans.  People  who  identify  as  fans are exposed to different risks by their participation in fan archives than  nonfans who identify as ethnic or sexual minorities and who take part in  building archives specific to their communities. I would never claim that  fans are subjected to the same mechanisms of control, or are disciplined in  the same ways, as these structurally disempowered groups. But fans, most  of whom identify as female, and many of whom identify as queer, are vul- nerable to attacks by corporate and legal entities, and fan archives can be  undermined  by  a  wide  range  of  censorial  forces  that  oppose  female  and  queer expressivity, especially in the realm of explicit sexuality. A desire to  protect  their  communities  against  these  threats  motivates  fan  archivists,  whether they manage small, single-fandom databases or volunteer for the  enormous, and rapidly expanding, multifandom repository of AO3. Fans’  archival  labor  is  crucial  preservationist  work  in  the  contemporary  digital  media space, for if we admit that a diverse and open society needs wom- en’s archives and LGBTQ archives, then we must count fan fiction archives  among our vital cultural memory institutions.   Break 3  Fan Time versus Media Time Break  Fan   versus   Time   Media   3 Time  Time and Performance in the Global Theater  In Acting Out, Bernard Stiegler  [2003] 2009  expresses anxiety over the mass  synchronization of individual consciousnesses by media: “[Media audiences]  end up being so well synchronized that they have lost their diachrony, that  is, their singularity, which is to say their liberty, which always means their  liberty to think”  55 . This break will investigate time and media consump- tion, opposing fan time to media time, and will address a concern that sev- eral theorists in addition to Stiegler have raised, which is that fans make  themselves captive to the temporalities of mass media by producing many  online  performances   I  am  here  drawing  on  Marshall  McLuhan’s  idea  of  the “global theater,” which posits that computer-mediated communication  facilitates new forms of everyday performance, as I explained in break 0 . I  posit that archives of fan works serve as an infrastructure that allows fans to  keep to an alternative, even oppositional, temporality to media time.  In Audiences, Nicholas Abercrombie and Brian Longhurst  1998  charac- terize mass media audiences as “diffused,” meaning that “in contemporary  society, everyone becomes an audience all the time. Being a member of an  audience is no longer an exceptional event. … Rather it is constitutive of  everyday life”  68–69 . And when everyone is an audience member, every- one is also a performer: “People simultaneously feel [that they are] mem- bers of an audience and that they are performers; they are simultaneously  watchers and being watched”  75 . Abercrombie and Longhurst explicitly  state that their thinking is informed by the blurring of boundaries between  “art and life,” “intermedia and performance art,” and “arts and non-arts”  promoted  by  postmodern  performance  artists  and  theorists,1  and  along  these lines, they cite Erving Goffman as an important early articulator of  the idea “that performance is entirely pervasive in everyday life”  74 . But    156   Break 3  they also criticize what they regard as Goffman’s failure to historicize this  phenomenon.  In Abercrombie and Longhurst’s analysis, the combination of “spectacle  and narcissism” that leads to everyone performing for everyone else, and  constantly serving as audiences for everyone else’s performances, has not  existed in every period of human society, but is specific to the era of mass  media: “One of the reasons that modern societies are more performative is  that the media of mass communications provide an important resource for  everyday performance”  74 . The “resource” that telecommunications pro- vides would seem to be that of a stage, a theater so capacious that, as McLu- han  1970  says, it encompasses the globe, in which billions can perform in  ways that are perceptible, accessible, and consumable by others.  Although  Abercrombie  and  Longhurst  never  mention  the  Internet,  their  conception  of  mass-media-as-stage  echoes  the  “global  theater”  the- ory of new media that McLuhan inaugurated and which I am developing  throughout this book: the Internet is a stage that allows all users to perform  to  other  users,  through  text  posts  or  images  or  videos  or  songs,  through  sharing playlists or liking others’ posts or publishing remixes or founding  digital archives. Building on Abercrombie and Longhurst’s arguments, Matt  Hills’s Fan Cultures  2002  also reads fannish audiences as performers and  takes a critical view of such performances—he does not deride fans for per- forming online, but argues that by performing, fans turn themselves, as a  group, into a disciplined extension of the culture industries. Hills  2002,  177  writes that when fans participate in an online newsgroup related to  a  television  series,  this  segment  of  the  “‘audience’  can  be  approached  as  a mediated product or performance itself,” with fans’ online posts collec- tively constituting a secondary consumable media text, made up of their  aggregated “self-representation[s] and self-performance[s].”  Fans’ “speculations, observations and commentaries,” gathered together  in large online communities, present “the audience-as-text” to fellow fans  and  interested  lurkers,  and  this  audience-text  gets  consumed  alongside  “the  originating  commodity-text”   Hill  2002,  177    for  example,  a  tele- vision program that serves as the primary object of interest of an online  fandom .  Hills  reads  the  “just-in-time”   178   temporality  of  online  fan  performances as rigidly determined by the television broadcasting sched- ule: “Practices of fandom have become increasingly enmeshed within the  rhythms and temporalities of broadcasting, so that fans now go online to  discuss new episodes immediately after the episode’s transmission time—or  even  during  ad-breaks—perhaps  in  order  to  demonstrate  the  ‘timeliness’  and  responsiveness  of  their  devotion”   178 .  Here,  Hills  echoes  Stiegler’s    Fan Time versus Media Time   157  fears of mass synchronization.  I wonder if Hills would interpret forms of  Internet  fan  performance  that  are  even  more  “just-in-time,”  such  as  live  blogging  and  live  tweeting—posting  reactions  on  social  media  platforms  as a television program or sports event is airing—as contemporary exem- plifications  of  what  he  calls  “the  colonizing  spatiotemporal  processes  of  timely and information-saturated commodity exchange” [177].  Hills unfa- vorably contrasts the timeliness required of online fan performance with  the  more  relaxed  temporality  of  pre-Internet,  print-based  fan  participa- tion.  He  writes,  “Describing  the  temporality  of  just-in-time  fandom  as  a  techno-evolution  towards  fuller  ‘interactivity,’  which  is  deemed  superior  to the prior ‘time-lag’ involved in writing to and reading niche magazines’  letters pages, … neglects the extent to which this eradication of the ‘time- lag’ works ever more insistently to discipline and regulate the opportunities  for temporally-licensed ‘feedback,’ and the very horizons of the fan experi- ence”  179 .  I will put aside for the moment the question of what has happened to  the temporal structuring of online fan performance in the postnetwork era,  when television content is consumed in a less regularized way  owing to  time-shifting technologies and the increase of the practice of all-at-once— “marathon”  or  “binge”—viewing  of  television  seasons  and  series .  What  remains  relevant  from  Hills’s  writing  is  his  suggestion  that  mediated  fan  performances might be giving rise to new kinds of temporalities, or new  perceptions of time. Hills’s distaste for what he reads as an increasing con- flation of the temporalities of online fan performance and those of televi- sion broadcasting lead me to suggest that we establish a concept of “fan  time” as distinct from “media time.”  Wishing for Alternative Temporalities  I define “media time” as consisting of the schedules mandated by the cul- ture industries’ production and sales cycles: the time of broadcasting in the  network television industry, the time of “drop dates” or release dates in the  music industry and in the online streaming industry, the time of premieres  in the film industry. We can read in Hills a wish for fan time to be different  from  media  time,  for  fans  to  have  their  own  performance  times,  that  is,  their own schedules for making and sharing performances, that are not so  tightly pinned to media time. Hills writes almost nostalgically of the way  that print time, and postal time, were structurally, technically slower than  electronic media time, and so print- and postal-based fan activities  and, I  would add, convention or “con”-based fan activities  de facto took place    158   Break 3  on  a  divergent  time  frame  than  media  releases.  But  in  an  age  of  digital  networks, when fan time can be  and, Hills would say, is compelled to be   coincident with media time, can fan time also still sometimes be different  from media time?  Online fan archiving is one way that fans can assert and defend their  ability to determine the temporality of their engagements with media texts.  Fan archivists, and all contributors to and users of fan archives, manifest a  wish to delay and or repeat their consumption of fan performances  in the  case of fan fiction archives, fan performances take the form of fan-authored  stories , so that the instant that a fan performance appears online is not the  only time that that performance can be consumed and appreciated. In addi- tion, Internet fan archives maintain the possibility of individuals joining  fandoms, and creating fan performances, long after a media text has ceased  to air on television and can only be found on a streaming site, or after it has  left the movie theaters and is only circulating on home media.  In other words, just as Jacques Derrida  1995, 24  says all archives open  onto  the  future,  fan  archives  keep  open  their  doors  to  fan  performances  that do not coincide with media time, and in doing so—in giving fans a  way  to  join  fandoms  belatedly,  in  offering  fans  sites  and  content  reposi- tories where fans can locate and engage with fan performances made ear- lier—fan  archives  tacitly  encourage  fans  to  perform,  and  to  make  public  their performances, in their own time, on their own schedule, whenever  they first discover a favorite media text or years after they first become fans  of a text, irrespective of when the text was initially released. Thus, in addi- tion to preserving fan works themselves, fan archives also preserve fan time  itself, allowing fan time to be variant and undecided—in fact, allowing it  to be decided entirely by individual fans—even as market forces work  if we  follow Hills’s and Stiegler’s arguments  to bring fan time and media time  into as close a bind as possible.  Time Feminized and Queered  The word “bind” in relation to temporality brings to mind Elizabeth Free- man’s  2010  landmark work Time Binds: Queer Temporalities, Queer Histories,  and I find many resonances between my idea of “fan time” and Freeman’s  and Jack Halberstam’s  2005  idea of “queer time.” Freeman coins the word  “chrononormativity”  to  describe  “the  use  of  time  to  organize  individual  human  bodies  toward  maximum  productivity,”  which  results  in  a  sense  of normal or regular time being implanted in individuals; she states that  chrononormativity is “a technique by which institutional forces come to    Fan Time versus Media Time   159  seem  like  somatic  facts.”  She  gives  the  example  of  industrial  wage  work  enacting a “violent retemporalization of bodies once tuned to the seasonal  rhythms of agricultural labor”  Freeman 2010, 3 , and Halberstam discusses  the  “time  of  reproduction,”  and  other  timetables  governing  conception,  childbirth, and childrearing, as fictions governed by “strict bourgeois rules  of respectability” and believed by many to be “natural and desirable”  Hal- berstam 2005, 5 . “Factory time” and “family time” are therefore two tem- poralities that arose in Western nations owing to a sedimentation, in the  modern period, of certain social, economic, and cultural norms, but “queer  time,” for both Freeman and Halberstam, throws these chrononormativi- ties into question.  “Fan time” similarly casts doubt on a range of dominant temporalities— not only on “media time,” but on what I would call “work leisure time,”  “linear time,” and “self other time.” Fan time is usually time spent on plea- sure rather than on productivity  or, when it is productive time—as when  fans invent their own performances—it is a productivity driven by pleasure  seeking  rather  than  by  an  imperative  to  do  wage  work ;  it  is  time  spent  in repetition rather than in progression  or rather, time spent consuming  multiple works related to one source text, rather than time spent consum- ing successive, distinct media products ; it is time spent on one’s self rather  than on one’s family or work customers colleagues  although one can argue  that fan time is also usually time spent with other fans, in online spaces,  and so it is not exclusively time spent on the self—but it is typically time  spent not on economic or domestic obligations .  The  time  that  women  spend  on  recreational,  media-related  pursuits,  such as reading romance novels and viewing soap operas, has long been  suspect in Western cultures, as indicated by the popular stereotypes of the  romance- or soap-“addicted” housewife as delusional, lazy, and or unintel- ligent, and by women’s commonly affixing the label “guilty pleasure” to  women-centric reality television shows and melodramas that they regularly  view. But feminist scholars such as Janice Radway  1991 , Tania Modleski   2007 , and Lauren Berlant  2008  have argued that women’s time is usu- ally subjected to so many diverse demands that many women experience  moments of private reading and viewing as periods of relief from others’  requirements, of self-restoration, and of escape from workplace and domes- tic labor. Fan time can therefore be seen as countering the ways that wom- en’s time is typically structured and routinized.  We  might  also  think  of  how  “fan  time”  and  “queer  time”  overlap,  as  when fans “queer a text,” producing online performances  which, again,  can be stories, videos, animated GIFs, commentary reviews, and so on  that    160   Break 3  foreground homoerotic or homosexual relations, or any nonheteronorma- tive romantic and sexual relations, between characters. Same-sex fiction or  “slash” fiction is an extraordinarily popular genre of fan fiction, as evinced  by the fact that most early scholarly research on fan fiction focused exclu- sively on slash fan communities and slash fic. The sheer quantity of slash,  polyamorous  “threesome” or “moresome” , BDSM  bondage-domination- sadomasochism ,  and  other  nonheteronormative  fics  produced  suggests  that  a  considerable  percentage  of  fan  time  is  queer  time.  The  fact  that  the majority of fic writers and readers are women and girls suggests that  the majority of fan time is women’s time, or what we might call alterna- tive women’s time, since that aligns better with my earlier statement that  women’s time is largely defined by external demands related to work and  domestic duties. With these readings of fan time in mind, I argue that Inter- net fan  archives not only help fans to refuse any temporal  regulation of  their performances by media time and the culture industries; fan archives  also aid fans’ refusal of chrononormativities linked to gender and sexual  orientation.   4  Repertoire Fills the Archive: Race, Sexuality, and Social  Justice in Fandom Chapter  Repertoire   Fills   the   4 Archive  Wanted: Content  Traditional  memory  institutions  are  built  by  professional  archivists,  who  acquire  new  entries  either  by  purchase  or  other  forms  of  active  search  and collection, or by donation. Rogue archivists also use these acquisition  methods   search-and-collect  or  donation ,  but  they  also  actively  solicit  the submission—and sometimes the creation—of content. Just as comput- ing communities and corporations occasionally organize “hackathons” to  inspire participants to write new code or brainstorm innovative projects in  short, defined periods of time, many rogue archivists run challenges, drives,  exchanges, and other time-constrained events to expressly encourage the  contribution of new materials to their repositories. In many cases, archi- vists structure these events to attract or generate specific types of content,  if they notice that certain categories of their archives are lacking and need  to grow.  In this chapter, I will describe how communities of volunteer amateur  fan pirate archivists and archive users stage events for digital content cre- ation and storage. In other sections of this book, I ask the reader to consider  the repertoires of archive building and archive use, as well as the repertoire  of  another  kind  of  memory  work,  the  work  of  versioning,  of  which  fan  authorship is but one genre. Here, I will present another type of repertoire:  the repertoire of archive contribution. I will show how archivists seek to  motivate the enactment of this repertoire, combined with the repertoire of  versioning, not only to assist them in growing their archives quantitatively,  but to qualitatively change the nature of their archives. In other words, by  urging archive users to become archive contributors, archivists seek to real- ize, at least partially, the promise of democratization and difference inher- ent in rogue digital archives.   162   Chapter 4  Thus, the uses that archivists make of repertoire—the ends to which they  put their audiences’ repertoires—are not only practical but political. Rogue  archivists not only want to grow their archives by inviting and facilitating  crowdsourced contributions, they also wish to fulfill the potential of digital  archives to allow anyone  in theory  to make deposits, and in doing so, to  expand the archives’ possible purposes and significations. The repertoire of  archive contribution is a carnival repertoire, for the digital archivists that  stage online events to promote a flurry of contribution activity often seek  to  imbue  these  events  with  an  air  of  festivity  and  fun,  demarcating  the  event times and spaces  the spaces are the digital archives themselves  as  special and extraordinary in the lives of their communities. To explore the  operations and effects of the carnival repertoire that plays out on digital  archives,  I  will  delve  into  the  large  body  of  theoretical  writing  that  has  taken up Mikhail Bakhtin’s  1984  analysis of carnival in medieval Europe,  as “a second world and a second life outside officialdom, a world in which  all  medieval  people  participated  more  or  less,  in  which  they  lived  dur- ing a given time of the year”  6 . I will argue that the carnival-like events  organized by digital archivists to encourage contributions are intended to  influence broader society and culture, and to serve as unofficial, idealized  spaces  that  make  imaginable,  conceivable,  and  graspable  new  modes  of   living,  being,  identifying,  and  communicating.  I  claim  that  rogue  archi- vists  who  run  archive-donation  events  are  as  concerned  with  shaping  a   collective  future  as  they  are  interested  in  memorializing  or  preserving  a  collective past.  Archive Events  Sly,1 a file-sharing site that aspires to be “more than just a regular BitTor- rent tracker for movies,” and defines itself as “a comprehensive library of  Arthouse,  Cult,  Classic,  Experimental  and  rare  movies  from  all  over  the  world,” runs a Master of the Month  MoM  uploading event every month.  Moderators announce a new MoM theme at the start of the month, and  “ask our users [to] share everything related to each Master of the Month  and get a fat bonus in the process”  bonuses take the form of share ratio— the ratio of bytes uploaded to bytes downloaded—and the higher a mem- ber’s  ratio,  the  more  files  they  can  download  from  the  site .  Past  MoM  themes include: Iranian films, stop-motion animation, blaxploitation, Kay  Francis, Hammer films, Kaiju-eiga, the golden age of serials  1929–1956 ,  Polish animation, Marguerite Duras, Otar Iosseliani and Georgian cinema,  ethnographic cinema, twenty-first-century video art, Spanish cinema under    Repertoire Fills the Archive   163  Franco, European sovereign-debt crisis, Ida Lupino, Chinese cinema under  Mao, Israel, Palestine, queer cinema s , and many others.  The  moderators  of  Sly  use  MoM  events  to  bulk  up  categories  of  their  archive that they deem to be undersized. Sly need not encourage uploads  of well-known art-house classics such as Chris Marker’s La Jetée  of which  three versions of differing resolutions are currently available on the site  or  of camp cult classics such as Russ Meyer’s Beyond the Valley of the Dolls  of  which Sly offers two versions . Rather, as evinced by the heterogeneous list  of MoM themes, it seems that the Sly moderators feel they must actively  solicit  users’  contributions  of  films  from  overlooked  historical  periods;  films made under restrictive political regimes that were rarely distributed  internationally;  films  from  non-Western  nations;  films  about  ethnic  and  sexual minorities; films in “minor” genres  nonfiction, serials, video, and  animation ; and films starring, directed by, or adapted from the works of  important women artists who may not be as well known to contemporary  audiences as they deserve. From the MoM themes, we can deduce what Sly’s  moderators have perceived to be gaps or deficiencies in their archive.  Looking  through  the  “collections”  generated  by  the  MoM  events,  we  can see that the Sly archive successfully expands its holdings through these  monthly  community  events:  the  average  number  of  films  uploaded  for  each  of  the  MoM  themes  listed  above  is  405.  The  least  generative  MoM  theme was Marguerite Duras  41 films , and the most generative MoM was  queer cinema s   2,770 films . Through incentivizing members to contrib- ute specific types of content at specific times, the archive fills in its weak  areas, and also exposes users to bodies of work with which many are likely  unfamiliar. Thus, the MoM events allow Sly to more robustly fulfill its mis- sion  of  becoming  a  “comprehensive  library”  of  nonmainstream  cinema.  Without the themed MoMs, if the Sly moderators simply allowed its mem- bers to upload whatever they chose to, the Sly archive might only contain  the most popular, most often-watched “art-house, cult, classic, experimen- tal and rare movies,” and smaller categories might be left underpopulated  indefinitely.  Sly  is  not  the  only  digital  archive  to  organize  contribution  drives.  Archive  Team  constantly  recruits  volunteers  to  help  download  and  save  certain websites, online communities, and social networks. Their deadlines  for each project are determined by the site owners’ intention to shut down,  or “sunset,” their sites at specified times  for example, as of this writing in  July 2014, Archive Team is operating a project focused on “Saving Verizon  customer pages, shutting down September 2014” . The South Asian Ameri- can  Digital  Archive   SAADA   is  currently  running  the  First  Days  Project,    164   Chapter 4  which invites archive users to submit their personal stories of their first day  in the United States, formatted as video, audio, or text  South Asian Ameri- can Digital Archive, “First Days Project” . Rhizome commissions digital art- works for its ArtBase through its annual commissions cycle  which makes  some awards based on the decisions of a jury and other awards based on  the votes of the online public , its RhizomeTumblr Internet Art Grant pro- gram  for artists working in and with the Tumblr blogging platform , and its  Internet Microgrant program  which funds proposals that attract the most  online  votes  in  the  amount  of  $500 .  In  2013,  the  Internet  Archive   IA   solicited proposals for a yearlong Tumblr residency program; the archivists- in-residence each curated content from the IA and showcased their mini- collections on the Internet Archive’s official Tumblr for one week in 2014   “Commissions” .  Some of these archive events attract contributions of content that users  already possess; for example, members of Sly may have saved digital files of  rare films on their drives or servers, and respond to the MoM’s call-to-upload  whenever they see an appropriate theme pop up. Other archive events are  intended to inspire archive users to create new content; SAADA’s First Days  Project, Rhizome’s commissions programs, and the IA’s Tumblr residencies  all incite users to generate new digital material for the enlargement of these  archives’ stores and, hopefully, of the archives’ audience base as well  it is a  truism of website operation that if a site that wishes to increase its traffic, it  must constantly publish new content . Another way that we might think of  these archive events is as drivers of transmediation: for the Sly MoMs, users  might “rip”  make digital files of  their hard-copy versions of films; for the  First Days Project, SAADA users must transform stories that exist in their  memories,  which  they  may  have  only  told  orally,  into  text audio video  recordings;  for  the  IA  Tumblr  residencies,  IA  users  must  select  a  body  of  items already contained in the IA and fashion them into a collection with a  visual style of presentation suitable for the Tumblr platform. We might say,  then,  that  archive  events  motivate  users  to  either  donate  digital  content  that they already have, make new digital material that they can contribute  to an archive, or make new  digital  versions of material that already exists,  either in their personal memories collections or in the archives themselves. From  the  preponderance  of  archive  events,  we  see  that  digital  archi- vists have the same goal as traditional archivists—that of preserving exist- ing  material—and  take  on  the  additional  objective  of  inciting  users  to  deliver fresh material to the archives. To the repertoires of archive use and  archive building, which I discussed in earlier sections, we must therefore  add  another  repertoire:  the  repertoire  of  archive  contribution,  which  is    Repertoire Fills the Archive   165  practiced by both digital archivists  who must organize and run the con- tent-driving events  and their audiences  who, hopefully, fulfill the requests  for new content issued by the archivists . Through the repeated enactment  of the repertoire of archive contribution, digital archives grow.  Battles, Bingos, and Bangs  Internet  fan  fiction  communities  and  archives  have  frequently  designed  and hosted content-generating events, such as kink_bingo, Amplificathon,  and  the  Porn  Battle,  which  were are  all  moderated,  rule-governed,  and  time-based  writing  challenges,  similar  to  National  Novel  Writing  Month  or Wikipedia’s Open Barn Raising  a kind of hackathon at which volunteer  members  of  WikiProject  Open  gather  “online  and  in  person  to  improve  Wikipedia articles related to openness in education”; see Wikipedia 2014 .  Many  fanfic  communities  and  archives  organize  these  types  of  events  in order to fill perceived gaps in the archives, like the Master of the Month  drives  on  Sly,  or  to  inspire  the  creation  of  more  of  the  kinds  of  content  desired by archivists, like Rhizome’s commissions programs and SAADA’s  First Days Project. In addition to the fan writing challenges listed above,  there are several other popular genres of fan content drives. For example,  Big Bang challenges require participants to produce novel-length stories in  a stated period of time  the original Big Bangs, in the Harry Potter fandom,  set a 50,000-word minimum, but more recent Bangs have lowered the man- datory word count , upon completion of which fan authors are rewarded  with fan art created specifically for their stories.2 Currently, the AO3 hosts  1,799 Big Bang works written for a diverse set of fandoms  Archive of Our  Own, “Big Bang Challenge” .  Another  challenge  called  Remix  Redux  invites  fan  authors  to  “remix”  other fan authors’ works, for instance, by rewriting the earlier story from  a different character’s point of view. The challenge is in its eleventh year,  and  AO3  now  holds  1,320  Remix  Redux  stories  spanning  413  fandoms   Archive of Our Own, “We Invented the Remix … Redux” . Trope Bingo,  another multifandom challenge, “uses common and well-known fandom  tropes as squares” on bingo cards that are sent to all “players”  fans who  sign up to participate , and asks players to make “bingo” by creating one  fan fiction story, of 500 words or more, for each of five contiguous squares  on  their  card   so,  each  player  creates  a  minimum  of  five  works  over  the  course of the challenge   Dreamwidth, “Trope Bingo” . The list of possible  tropes includes amnesia, forced to marry, mistletoe kiss, poker strip poker,  presumed dead, road trip, secret twin doppelganger, sharing a bed, snowed    166   Chapter 4  in,  and  time  travel   trope_bingo  2013 —all  scenarios  and  situations  that  frequently recur in most fandoms’ fan fiction. At present, the AO3 contains  1,768 Trope Bingo works in 613 fandoms  Dreamwidth, “Trope Bingo” .  Probably  the  most  famous  fan  works  exchange  is  Yuletide,  an  annual  winter holiday event dedicated to small or “rare” fandoms  that is, fandoms  with few fan fiction stories written for them , in which fans nominate rare  fandoms for which they want stories written, and or sign up to write sto- ries in rare fandoms; based on their preferences, fan writers are then given  assignments to write stories of at least 1,000 words for specific fandoms,  and have four weeks to complete their assignments before December 25,  when all stories are “revealed,” or posted online, at the AO3  Archive of  Our Own 2009 . The eleventh year of Yuletide took place in 2013, and the  AO3 now holds 23,826 Yuletide works written for 5,421 fandoms  Archive  of Our Own, “Yuletide” .3  dark_agenda Challenges  Of special interest to me are fan events that aim to increase the racial, eth- nic, national, and sexual diversity of fan works. A fan activist group called  dark_agenda, founded in 2009, states its mission to be “offer[ing] resources  [to  fans]  in  order  to  increase  the  representation  of  international,  non- English  and  non-Western  fandoms  in  multi-fandom  fanwork  exchanges  and festivals, as well as promote the responsible portrayal of characters of  colo u r”  Dreamwidth 2014 . The group’s members have so far run a num- ber  of  ficathons  focused  on  “chromatic”  characters—“chromatic”  being  the term selected by dark_agenda’s leaders as “an umbrella definition for  ‘person of colo ur ,’ ‘non-white,’ ‘multiracial,’ ‘indigenous,’ ‘sourcelander,’  ‘hyphenate,’ ‘diasporian,’ etc.”  In  2009  and  2010,  dark_agenda  ran  Chromatic  Yuletide,  a  “subchal- lenge” of Yuletide, which operates according to the same rules as Yuletide  but focuses on “increas[ing] the representation of chromatic sources and  characters  in  rare  fandoms.”  Over  those  two  years,  279  Chromatic  Yule- tide  works  in  298  fandoms  were  archived  on  the  AO3   Archive  of  Our  Own, “Chromatic Yuletide 2009,” “Chromatic Yuletide 2010” .4 In 2010,  the  group  also  launched  the  Racebending  Revenge  Challenge  “as  a  pro- test  against  whitewashing  in  Western  media  and  in  particular  The  Last  Airbender”  dark_administrator 2011b .5 Participants in the challenge were  asked to “Re-write one or more white characters in the fandom s  of your  choice as chromatic non-white PoC [people of color], in a story of at least  500 words, with some acknowledgment of how the racial difference would    Repertoire Fills the Archive   167  make a difference to the story being told.” The master list of challenge sub- missions on Dreamwidth contains 48 works in 36 fandoms  Dreamwidth  2013 .  In  addition,  dark_agenda  organized  Chromatic  Remix  Redux  in  2011,  which  operated  alongside  the  main  Remix  Redux  challenge,  and  asked  participants to feature a chromatic character in their remixes. The Chro- matic  Remix  Redux  archive  on  the  AO3  now  holds  1,320  works  in  413  fandoms   Archive  of  Our  Own,  “Chromatic  Remix  Redux” .  In  2011,  the  founder  and  moderator  of  the  Porn  Battle,  oxoniensis,  invited  dark_ agenda  to  run  a  Chromatic  subchallenge  for  Porn  Battle  XI.  In  her  oral  history  interview,  oxoniensis   2012   states,  “The  Chromatic  side  to  the  Battle was inspired by the Chromatic Yuletide. I wanted to do something  to  help  encourage  more  entries  that  included  people  of  color.  Actually  making a separate list of all the Chromatic prompts had two purposes: to  put  the  idea  of  writing drawing  etc.  a  person  of  color  in  people’s  minds  and make it easier for them to do so.” The Porn Battle archive shows that  the Chromatic Porn Battle resulted in approximately 1,957 prompts  The  Porn Battle, “Chromatic Prompts”  and 218 fills  The Porn Battle, “Chro- matic Entries”  in 115 fandoms. Also in 2011, dark_agenda ran the Kalei- doscope  Fanwork  Exchange,  “a  multimedia  fanwork  exchange  …  open  to all sources with chromatic characters or people and by chromatic cre- ators,”  welcoming  all  genres  of  fan  productions  in  all  languages,  “par- ticularly  in  English  dialects  and  non-English  languages  associated  with  chromatic cultures.” The Kaleidoscope archive on the AO3 holds 64 works  in 61 fandoms  dark_administrator 2011a .  The above is not a comprehensive listing of dark_agenda’s activities, but   the events described are the group’s highest-profile projects.  A Darker Archive  The  first  way  that  I  will  “read”  the  online  activities  organized  by  dark_ agenda—the Chromatic Yuletides, Racebending Revenge, Chromatic Remix  Redux, Chromatic Porn Battle, and Kaleidoscope—is as a series of responses  to, and protests of, the notorious underrepresentation of racial and ethnic  minorities in mass media productions. In my view, the primary intention  driving the dark_agenda was similar to the intention behind Sly’s MoMs  and SAADA’s First Days Project: to incite the crowdsourced creation of new  content, content of a specific category and type that was perceived to be  lacking from an archive. In the case of the chromatic fanworks challenges,  the “archive” whose gaps were being filled was not an individual online fan    168   Chapter 4  fiction archive; it was the enormous metaphorical archive constituted by  studio films and broadcast and cable television programs.  For  decades,  media  scholars  and  watchdog  groups  have  accused  mass  media of offering predominantly “negative and or stereotyped images of  many groups,” as well as of “providing too few images of certain groups”   Klein and Shiffman 2009, 56 . On this last point—that films and television  programs contain “too few images” of certain groups, particularly nonwhite  characters—every study of media content ever published is in agreement.  The 2014 Hollywood Diversity Report issued by the Ralph J. Bunche Center  for African American Studies at UCLA, for example, shows that “minorities  claimed only 10.5 percent of the lead roles” in Hollywood films made in  2011  Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies at UCLA 2014,  6 , and that “minority actors claimed just 5.1 percent of the lead roles in  broadcast comedies and dramas” in the 2011–12 season  8 . Minority per- formers fared better in cable comedies and dramas, playing 14.7 percent of  the lead roles  8–9 . The report’s analysis of “minority cast share,” or the  percentage of the total cast of the media text consisting of minority charac- ters, showed that there were more minority actors in supporting positions,  but only 26.7 percent of films  6–7 , 25.3 percent of broadcast television  programs  11–12 , and 27.2 percent of cable television programs  12  had  casts that were at least as diverse as the US population  which is 36.3 per- cent minority . In both lead and supporting roles, therefore, nonwhites are  dramatically underrepresented in the mass media.  Gaye Tuchman  1978 , Debra Merskin  1998 , Bonnie Y. Ohye and Jes- sica  Henderson  Daniels   1999 ,  and  Hugh  Klein  and  Kenneth  Shiffman   2009  refer to the media’s underrepresentation of specific groups as “sym- bolic annihilation.” Merskin defines symbolic annihilation “as the way cul- tural production and media representations ignore, exclude, marginalize,  or trivialize a particular group”  1998, 335 . I choose to think of the media’s  symbolic  annihilation  of  minorities  as  an  annihilation  from  an  archive  of images and sounds and narratives—an archive of recorded storytelling  media. When Klein and Shiffman point to the “near-total absence” of cer- tain groups from mass media  2009, 56 , I think of this absence as an archi- val absence, that is, as the exclusion of those groups’ documents and texts  from  an  archive.  When  Klein  and  Shiffman  state  that  “the  absence  of  a  particular group in the media instructs people, albeit tacitly, about how one  should or should not act, and about what one should or should not look  like”  57 , I consider Eric Ketelaar’s  2001  arguments that all archives con- tain “tacit narratives of power and knowledge”  132 , that “social, cultural,  political,  economic  and  religious  contexts  determine  the  tacit  narratives    Repertoire Fills the Archive   169  of an archive”  136–137 , and that the analyst of an archive “should make  these  contexts  transparent,  maybe  even  visible”   137 .  Like  an  archive,  the corpus of mass media texts is replete with tacit narratives that reflect  the power structures of the society and culture in which the text is made,  and mass media scholars like Klein and Shiffman make visible the media  archive’s tacit narratives.  dark_agenda’s project, therefore, is at least in part the construction of a  parallel archive to the archive of mass media, an archive of fan-produced  storytelling media that features characters of color as the lead characters,  and that symbolically annihilates not white characters  who may still, after  all, feature—as supporting players—in the works created for dark_agenda’s  “chromatic”  challenges ,  but  white  dominance  and  white  privilege  in  media representations. dark_agenda, in other words, sets an agenda for fan- dom, as a collective, to answer the erasure, exclusion, and diminishment  of characters of color from the archive of media by collectively construct- ing a darker archive, an archive full of the stories of the darker characters  found  in  filmic  and  televisual  source  texts,  who  most  often  “prop”  and  “pedestal”  the  white  characters.  Another  way  that  we  could  conceive  of  this darker archive is as an addition, an insertion, a forced entry, of stories  about people of color into the total archive of media, which we might call  the  Mediascape.  By  calling  into  being  a  darker  archive,  dark_agenda  has  attempted to transform the Western Mediascape, or cultural imaginary, as a  whole—has tried to make the giant Media Archive more inclusive and more  representative of the actual racial and ethnic diversity of human existence  than it would be if the culture industries’ productions were allowed to pro- liferate unanswered.  Touring through the “dark archive” that was called into being by dark_ agenda, one finds that the only stories about “Disney Princesses” feature  Tiana,  the  African-American  heroine  of  The  Princess  and  the  Frog,  and  Mulan,  the  Chinese  warrior  heroine  of  the  eponymous  film;  Cinderella,  Aurora  Sleeping Beauty , Ariel  The Little Mermaid , and Belle  Beauty and the  Beast  do not figure in this archive, except to serve as foils to the princesses  of color. One encounters a story in which the Kryptonians in the Superman  universe, including Kal-El Clark Kent Superman himself, are black  written  for the Racebending Revenge challenge , and young Clark must deal with  rampant  racism  in  Smallville  growing  up.  One  notes  that  all  of  the  sto- ries taking place in the universe of the CBS award-winning television pro- gram The Good Wife “star” Kalinda Sharma, the British Indian investigator,  rather than the series’ actual lead character, Anglo-American attorney Alicia  Florrick. Chromatic characters are always the lead characters, with white    170   Chapter 4  characters  either  absent,  “cast”   or  rather,  recast   in  supporting  roles,  or  acting as villains and obstacles. In her analysis of Ernest Hemingway’s fic- tion, Toni Morrison notes that Hemingway’s white American male heroes  are often surrounded by black African male nurses: “Tontos all,” Morrison  calls the nurses, “whose role is to do everything possible to serve the Lone  Ranger without disturbing his indulgent delusion that he is indeed alone”   Morrison 1992, 82 . Morrison here could well be describing the relation  between characters of color and white characters in most US media fictions:  chromatic  characters  “do  everything  possible  to  serve”  the  white  heroes  without disturbing the illusion that they are the sole heroes protagonists  stars leads. The stories generated by dark_agenda’s challenges reverse this  historical  relation,  putting  chromatic  characters  in  the  heroic  and  domi- nant positions, and white characters in the positions of support.  I realize that “dark archive” has another meaning, that of an archive that  functions but is closed to the public, whereas here I use the phrase to refer  to a metaphorical archive full of stories about nonwhite characters. Simi- larly, the phrase “dark agenda” usually refers to a group  real or fictional   having  a  concealed,  nefarious  plan—a  conspiracy  plot—but  the  fan  col- lective dark_agenda undertakes schemes to correct  in some small degree   an injustice, which is mass media’s historically, consistently, foregrounding  and focusing on white characters and marginalizing characters of color. The  name “dark_agenda” is therefore somewhat ironic, as it implies that media  audiences must engage in conspiracy tactics in order to bring about even  a minor revolution in media representations of nonwhite peoples—that is,  only an unofficial, largely unnoticed, series of writing and media produc- tion events, taking place in the “shadow economy”  Fiske 1992  of fandom,  and  making  no  difference  to  the  casting  processes  of  films  or  television  series, can hope to create archives in which every text is primarily about a  person, or people, of color. My term “dark archive” is also ironic, as it hints  that the only archive that can effectively feature characters of “darker” skin  color than the characters who dominate cinema and television is one that  will go largely unseen and unused by Hollywood media producers and the  vast majority of media consumers—the archive is dark not because its archi- vists intend it to be inaccessible, but because so few media makers and audi- ences are interested in the question of where to find versions of media texts  that are predominantly populated by nonwhite characters.  In break 2, I cited Gregory Sholette’s characterization of amateur artists,  whose  labor  and  purchases  support  those  at  the  pinnacle  of  the  profes- sional art world, as “dark matter” and as an “army” of “invisibles”  Sholette  2011, 1, 3, 7, 16 . Those who participate in dark_agenda’s events constitute    Repertoire Fills the Archive   171  a different kind of dark army of invisibles: one that does not support the  top of the media industry pyramid, but tries to undermine its racist world- view from below, from the unseen base. The “agenda” of this army is to  combat mass media’s symbolic annihilation of darker-skinned peoples by  constructing  a  parallel  “dark  archive”—or,  we  could  say,  by  “darkening”  the total Media Archive—through staging events that prompt the produc- tion of a plethora of stories about characters that usually exist only in the  shadows of whiteness.  The Vernacular Creativity of Archivists  Rogue  digital  archives  are  therefore  often  filled  through  events,  that  is,  through archivists demarcating specific objectives for archive users, special  places  sections of the archives, or subarchives , and or particular times  the  durations of the challenges  in which users must make their deposits. In the  collective excitement and sense of group fun that they elicit, these online  content drives resemble real-world event genres such as community theater  amateur  dramatics,  local  fairs,  quilting  bees,  and  craft  competitions—all  forms of what Tim Edensor et al.  2010  call “vernacular creativity,” which  they contrast with “state-led spectacular flagship projects”  5  such as art  biennials, high-profile music festivals, and the development  read: gentri- fication  of “distinctive cultural quarters” within urban centers  5–6 . With  their idea of vernacular creativity, Edensor et al. seek to expand the defini- tion of cultural creativity beyond long-standing notions of “the uniquely  creative individual”  8  or the “cool city”  5 , to include creativity that “is  located in everyday, popular, vernacular culture”  9 .  Evoking the earlier work of British cultural studies scholars such as Dick  Hebdige  1983 , Raymond Williams  [1958] 2002 , and Paul Willis  1997 ,  Edensor et al. argue for greater recognition of what Willis calls “common  culture,” that is, the “vibrant symbolic life and symbolic creativity in every- day  life”   Willis  1997,  206   and  “the  necessariness  of  everyday  symbolic  and communicative work”  208 . Vernacular creativity, for Edensor et al.,  is a term that honors the “sensation, fun, desire and festivity” in common  culture. I regard digital archives’ content drives as a recently inaugurated  category of vernacular creativity, though this category bears close relation  to far older vernacular traditions. Like barnraisings  a term that, as I stated  above, Wikipedia sometimes uses for their page editing events , bake sales,  fundraising races, charity auctions, craft competitions, and other live local  practices  already  mentioned,  online  archive-contribution  events  encour- age  members  of  a  community  to  come  together  and  share  their  creative    172   Chapter 4  and productive energies, in designated spaces and at specified times. Digi- tal  archivists  import  a  long-standing  repertoire  of  community  activity— the repertoire of festival organization and local event management—from  physical into virtual space. They use this repertoire of community activity  to literally enlarge a “common culture,” that is, the cultural texts held in  common by a group. Edensor et al. permit us to perceive the creativity of  digital archivists in appropriating older, real-world traditions as the bases  of new kinds of online festivals. Edensor et al. write: “Creativity should …  be conceived as an improvisation quality that, across all forms of cultural  activity, requires people to adapt to particular circumstances. Even in appar- ently repetitious practices, regeneration actually takes place under circum- stances that are always different. … This means that there ‘is creativity even  and especially in the maintenance of an established tradition’”  Edensor et  al. 2010, 8; citing Hallam and Ingold 2007, 5–6 . By translating real-world  traditions into virtual sites, and ensuring that ancient repertoires of com- munal fun-making and collective content production survive through con- tinual online reenactment, digital archivists increase the quantities of data  stored and saved in their servers. Thus, a repertoire of vernacular creativity  fills archives of crowdsourced content. In this, as in so many other ways,  the memory modes of repertoire and archive are shown to be mutually and  inextricably dependent on one another in the digital age. By “remember- ing” and renewing traditional event structures that inspire a group to take  enthusiastic and timely action, rogue archivists fill their communities’ net- worked memory banks.  “‘Carnival’ Is an IP Address”  A closely related repertoire to that of the “vernacular” and “everyday” cre- ative practices lionized by Edensor et al. is the repertoire of carnival. If we  can see how the baking competition and the book drive are translated into  Internet events, how does carnival take place online? One might say that  the  Internet  itself  is  a  carnival;  Bakhtin  eases  the  path  for  such  a  defini- tion by describing medieval carnival in similar terms to those that Marshall  McLuhan  uses  to  describe  global  networked  telecommunications.  Where  McLuhan  and  Nevitt   1972   state  that  in  the  “global  theater,”  “all  men  become actors and there are few spectators”  145 , Bakhtin  [1965] 1984   writes,  “Carnival  does  not  know  footlights,  in  the  sense  that  it  does  not  acknowledge any distinction between actors and spectators. … Carnival is  not a spectacle seen by the people; they live in it, and everyone participates  because its very idea embraces all the people”  7 . Donald Theall explicitly    Repertoire Fills the Archive   173  compares the Internet to carnival as defined by Bakhtin, stating that the  Internet and the Web in the 1990s challenged “those accustomed to the  comfort of the hierarchical control of the state, corporation, and church”  by inaugurating “anarchic freedom [within] an essentially non-hierarchical  entity permitting powerful exchange and communication”; an entity that  serves as “a site of personal freedom as an extension of [the user’s] home,  common room, or watering place” and that offers “great potential for car- nivalesque unmaskings”  Theall 1999, 158 . In this framework, the Inter- net seems quite analogous to the “second world and second life”  Bakhtin  [1965] 1984, 6  incarnated by the medieval carnival, and the virtual world  and the physical world could be regarded as constituting a new “two-world  condition”  6 .  But  of  course,  the  Internet  only  has  the  potential  to  be  carnivalesque.  It can serve as a site of “anarchic, personal freedom,” but it is also, writes  Theall, “a serious source of communication, information and data,” oper- ating  as  a  crucial  platform  for  business  and  government:  “[The  Internet]  intertwines  the  manipulative  promotion  of  commercial  …  interests  with  the indulgent leisure of transgression and playfulness”  Theall 1999, 159 .  And there is a persistent danger, Theall argues, of corporate forces seeking  to close down certain types of play that transpire online, just as the eigh- teenth and nineteenth centuries witnessed “the sanitization of traditional  carnival and other transgressive spaces”  159 . So, if we make the case that  we  can  find  a  new  version  of  carnival  online,  we  must  find  it  in  spaces  and events that are, in some way, directly or indirectly, opposed to what  Bakhtin calls “officialdom” and what Theall calls “serious” enterprises. And  we must acknowledge that carnival does not take place all year round, but  is confined to special times; “carnival time,” as Bakhtin says, is different  from other times of the year, and it is only “during carnival time [that] life  is subject only to its own laws, that is, the laws of its own freedom”  [1965]  1984, 7 . So, while I do not think it can be said that the Internet as a whole  is a constant manifestation of carnival, I think we can discover carnival tak- ing place on the network, and that one group of sites where carnival thrives  is fan fiction archives. The “doing” of carnival, the repertoire of carnival,  has been imported from physical to virtual reality. As my colleague at the  Berkeley Center for New Media, Professor Greg Niemeyer, hearing me talk  about the carnivalesque in online fan communities, remarked, “‘Carnival’  is now an IP address.”  I perceive the spirit of carnival to suffuse dark_agenda’s challenges. The  challenges are time specific, and, like Bakhtin’s medieval carnival, their pri- mary purpose is to upend an existing hierarchy: the racial ethnic hierarchy    174   Chapter 4  of media representation. “Carnival shakes up the authoritative version of  language and values, making room for a multiplicity of voices and mean- ings,” writes Shanti Elliot  1999, 129 . “Carnival reversal implies a change  from principles of stability and closure to constant possibility”  130 . Elliot  derives the idea of “carnival reversal” from Bakhtin, who argues that car- nival demonstrates “the peculiar logic of the ‘inside out’  à l’envers , of the  ‘turnabout,’ of a continual shifting from top to bottom, from front to rear,  of  numerous  parodies  and  travesties,  humiliations,  profanations,  comic  crownings  and  uncrownings”   Bakhtin  [1965]  1984,  11 .  dark_agenda’s  fanworks  exchanges  effectuate  a  reversal,  an  inside-out,  a  turnabout,  of  mass media’s all-too-stable principles, which favor white heroes and their  narratives above all. dark_agenda brings about times and spaces in which,  only briefly and only through what Elliot calls Bakhtinian “‘unofficial’ lan- guage”  Elliot 1999, 130 , the media world’s habitual privileging of white- ness is transformed, and the prominence of nonwhite characters and their  stories becomes possible.  Other  fan  challenges,  such  as  kink_bingo  and  Amplificathon,  also  are  carnivalesque,  perhaps  even  more  so  than  dark_agenda  in  their  empha- ses on  what some might deem  bodily excesses. Although many “kinks”  included in kink_bingo’s cards6 are not sexual acts, the moderators, eruth- ros and thingswithwings, always include sexual kinks that are not common  in fan writing, such as watersports, enemas, “plushie” or furry kink, blood  play, and medical play. “I think we’ve done some good work to help make  kinky fic more acceptable and less shadowy and locked away,” says thing- swithwings  eruthros and thingswithwings 2012  in her interview. Ampli- ficathon, the challenge run by jinjurly  founder of the Audiofic Archive ,  invites fans to record themselves reading fan fiction stories aloud and to  share  those  recordings   “audiofics” ,  which  jinjurly   2012   says  are  often  perceived as “very strange” and “very intimate,” in that “you are basically  sharing a part of your body with people in a way that, yeah, sometimes  people find really creepy.” jinjurly describes how some audioficcers express  regret  for  their  vocal  performances:  “The  number  [of  audioficcers]  I’ve  seen apologize for having Southern accents is really pretty dismaying, or  German  accents,  or  whatever  your  unpopular  accent-of-the-month  is.  …  I mean, you see people self-castigating for accents all the time. … [People  say] ‘Oh, I talk too fast, or I talk too slow, or my voice isn’t pretty enough,  or  oh,  my  accent.’  You  know  what?  Who  cares?  It’s  your  voice.  It’s  your  voice, and because you’re a person, your voice is important”  jinjurly 2012 .  For jinjurly, the uniqueness and distinctiveness of each reader’s speech is  precisely what should be celebrated, as every individual voice matters, and    Repertoire Fills the Archive   175  deserves to be heard, literally and metaphorically, in fandom and in larger  society. She says,  That diversity is—that’s what I want the world to be, that’s what I want fandom to  be. And so that’s what I want the [Audiofic] archive to be. I want it to include as  many things as possible and I want to not curate. I don’t want to pass judgment on  anything. … I want to say, “Hey look, we’re [fandom is] big and we’re [all] differ- ent and isn’t it cool that we’re this giant tapestry that you’re too close to see it, but  I’m sure there’s a picture there somehow.” … The fact [is] that I approach this fairly  politically and that I definitely have an agenda there—I mean, the agenda is sort of,  broadly stated, is that every voice be valued and that everybody’s contribution be  valued. … So yeah, that’s why we solicit [for the Audiofic Archive through Amplifi- cathon and other mechanisms].  jinjurly 2012   Both kink_bingo and Amplificathon ask fans to bring into being represen- tations  and  performances  that  may  strike  some  as  “too  much.”  Some  of  the kink_bingo prompts may strike a portion of the players as too perverse;  some of the audiofics produced for Amplificathon may sound to listeners  as too accented. But this too-much-ness in the productions of composed  and default bodies  defined in chapter 6 , which both challenges not only  welcome but actively call for, is a mainstay of the carnival repertoire.  Bakhtin makes clear that carnival, as a form or style or action, does not  only transpire in the lived world, but is also evident in a wide range of artis- tic genres. In Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics, Bakhtin  [1963] 1993  focuses  on the carnivalesque in literature; he writes, “Carnivalization, once it has  penetrated and to a certain extent determined the structure of a genre, can  be used by various movements and creative methods. … In fact, every move- ment and creative method interprets and renews it in its own way”  160 .  Bakhtin argues that the translation of live carnival into the realm of litera- ture is evident in the genre of “grotesque realism,” exemplified by Miguel  Cervantes’s Don Quixote and the body of Sancho Panza: “Sancho’s fat belly   panza , his appetite and thirst still convey a powerful carnivalesque spirit.  … Sancho’s materialism, his potbelly, appetite, his abundant defecation, are  on the absolutely lower level of grotesque realism”  Bakhtin [1965] 1984,  22 . I read kink_bingo and Amplificathon as allied with Cervantes’s project  to import carnival into the format of written text—to transmute the physi- cal event of carnival onto the page  or screen —and, in doing so, to reverse,  challenge,  and  unsettle  Western  modernity’s  idealization  and  normaliza- tion of the body. Writes Bakhtin, “The Renaissance saw the body in quite a  different light than the Middle Ages. … As conceived by these [Renaissance]  canons, the body was first of all a strictly completed, finished product. …  All signs of its unfinished character, of its growth and proliferation were    176   Chapter 4  eliminated; its protuberances and offshoots were removed, its convexities   signs of new sprouts and buds  smoothed out, its apertures closed. … The  inner processes of absorbing and ejecting were not revealed. The individual  body  was  presented  apart  from  its  relation  to  the  ancestral  body  of  the  people”  [1965] 1984, 29 . Kink_bingo and Amplificathon ask participants  to join them in staging carnivals online, carnivals that take place through  written  words  and  spoken  stories,  as  do  Cervantes’s  novel  and  Quixote’s  tales. These networked fan carnivals, like medieval carnivals and the carni- valesque literature studied by Bakhtin, revel in all permutations of bodily  desire and all possible accents of speech. They open up the metaphorical  archives  constituted  by  source  texts  and  the  actual  archives  located  on  Dreamwidth  and  the  AO3  and  the  Audiofic  Archive,  and  they  urge  fans  to add their stories of piss and blood and fecal matter, and their voices of  diaspora and transnationalism and regionalism and immigration, to those  archives.  The  stories  produced  for  and  through  kink_bingo  and  Amplifi- cathon not only enlarge archives quantitatively, they also transform them  qualitatively, demonstrating that the archives can hold more than anyone  thought them capable of, stretching the capacity of the archives beyond all  conventional limits of appropriateness and normality.  “The  body  of  grotesque  realism  was  hideous  and  formless.  It  did  not  fit the framework of the ‘aesthetics of the beautiful’ as conceived by the  Renaissance,”  writes  Bakhtin   [1965]  1984,  29 .  The  fanworks  challenges  that I have described all refute dominant “aesthetics,” as established and  reified by mass media. Aesthetics that privilege the white body, that shun  “deviant”  forms  of  pleasure  and  connection,  and  that  designate  a  small  spectrum of American and British accents to be the “norm” in spoken Eng- lish—all  come  under  attack  by  the  proliferation  of  stories  generated  by  those who accept the challenges set forth by dark_agenda, kink_bingo, and  Amplificathon. Bakhtin states that carnival has political ramifications, in  that “its joy at change and its joyful relativity, is opposed to that one-sided  and gloomy official seriousness which is dogmatic and hostile to evolution  and change, which seeks to absolutize a given condition of existence or a  given social order”  Bakhtin [1963] 1993, 160 . Carnival reminds its par- ticipants that the future is open, that existing social structures and divides  are more fluid, and more subject to transformation, than they appear. The  carnival of Internet fan production events urges media consumers to realize  the transmutability of mass media’s representational logics, and to take the  initiative themselves to invert and broaden the culture industries’ defini- tions of “acceptable,” “beautiful,” or “legible” bodies, voices, and physical  acts.   Repertoire Fills the Archive   177  Elliot  interprets  Bakhtin’s  emphasis  on  the  physicality  of  the  carni- valesque—Bakhtin’s fascination with the constant openness of mouths and  other bodily orifices in carnival literature—as indicative of Bakhtin’s belief  in the “constant possibility” of change. Elliot writes that “nothing is fixed  in Bakhtin’s carnival world, and everything is in a state of becoming. …  By  paying  close  attention  to  the  relationships  between  objects   mouths,  anuses, food, excrement , Bakhtin reveals a hidden network of values. The  image of becoming expresses hope for the future, which Bakhtin contrasts  to the ‘official’ preoccupation with the past that renders life pre-determined  and unchangeable. … [Bakhtin] understands interest in the open orifices  of the human body as an artistic way of shaping the future by passing the  material of the world through them”  Elliot 1999, 130 . Elliot gives us yet  another way to understand archontic production: as a digestion of the past,  as an embodied transformation of received matter into new substance, as  a way of opening oneself to archival material and feeding on it, then using  that  nourishment  to  project  a  future  that  little  resembles  the  raw  input.  Rather than carnival time being marked by its being a temporary but short- lived exception from “regular” time, we can see carnival time as a critical  time when change occurs, or becomes imaginable. A carnival may be brief  in  duration—even  in  carnival  literature,  the  experience  of  reading  Quix- ote or a Dostoevsky novel, or a kink_bingo story, or a chromatic challenge  story, or any carnivalesque piece will not last very long—but it can infuse its  participants with a conviction that the prevailing social and cultural order  and structure need not always prevail.  Fictions for Real Change  But by what mechanisms will the writing of fictional stories, and the build- ing  of  fan  archives,  lead  to  radical  social  and  cultural  change?  Scholars  on  “fan  activism”  have  demonstrated  that  media  texts  serve  as  powerful  shared  archives  of  symbols,  narratives,  slogans,  and  characters  that  mil- lions of citizens have used in demonstrations and other public actions. In a  special issue of Transformative Works and Cultures on “Transformative Works  and Fan Activism”  vol. 10 , Henry Jenkins  2012  writes about the Harry  Potter Alliance’s numerous campaigns for human rights, marriage equality,  labor rights, net neutrality, and other liberal causes; Jonathan Gray  2012   describes protestors of the Wisconsin union-busting Budget Repair Bill in  2011 using iconography and narratives from Star Wars, South Park, and The  Simpsons in their clothing and signage; and Melissa M. Brough and Sangita  Shresthova  2012  analyze the decision of Palestinian West Bank activists,    178   Chapter 4  in December 2010, to cosplay  costume-play  as the blue Nav’i from James  Cameron’s  film  Avatar,  identifying  their  cause  with  that  of  the  fictional  Nav’i, who are forcibly evicted from their land by invaders in the movie, in  order to draw mass media attention to their grievances.  As Rebecca Schneider documents, numerous Occupy Wall Street  OWS   participants and supporters wore costumes based on mass media archives,  including the Wachowski Siblings’ V for Vendetta  many who took part in  OWS  wore  Guy  Fawkes  masks,  with  their  “white-face  grin,”  used  by  the  protagonist of the film  and zombie texts such as George A. Romero’s clas- sic cult movie Dawn of the Dead and the popular comic and television series  The  Walking  Dead   “In  a  3  October  2011  protest  action,  OWS  protesters  representing the 99% bloodied themselves, munched on Monopoly money,  and  marched  on  Wall  Street  as  zombies,”  writes  Schneider  [2012,  154] .  Louisa Ellen Stein describes how, in the wake of the 9 11 attacks, members  of an online community dedicated to the television series Roswell “drew on  Roswell fan repertoires to manage disagreements and debates, to organize  community actions and charity drives, to create memorial art images and  to share their experiences and feelings”  Stein 2002, 473 .  Clearly, participants in media fandoms often use their “fan repertoires”  of communal discussion and collective action for real-world, political, and  even revolutionary causes and goals. Stephen Duncombe  2012  argues that  in  fact,  fandom  is  a  necessary,  or  at  least  highly  generative,  groundwork  from  which  activism  springs:  “Scratch  an  activist  and  you’re  apt  to  find  a fan. It’s no mystery why: fandom provides a space to explore fabricated  worlds that operate according to different norms, laws, and structures than  those we experience in our ‘real’ lives. Fandom also necessitates relation- ships with others: fellow fans with whom to share interests, develop insti- tutions, and create a common culture. This ability to imagine alternatives  and build community, not coincidentally, is a basic prerequisite for political  activism”  sec. 1 .  In her interview, Tari talks about fans’ ability to collectively conceive of  political and social change in language similar to Duncombe’s. Comment- ing on the allegation that participation in fandom is mere escapism, she  says: “[Fandom] is escaping [reality], but I think there’s a lot of benefit in  fantasizing and dreaming of things that are not necessarily realistic, you  know?”  Tari 2012 . Fans, having cultivated the skill of immersing them- selves in, and expanding, unreal worlds, can create elaborate fantasies of  utopian ways of being, and to construct activist performances, demonstra- tions, and campaigns that try to bring the real world closer to those utopias.    Repertoire Fills the Archive   179  Change Within  Another means by which fans’ politically oriented stories can affect or influ- ence lived reality is through the internal changes that such stories might  effect in fans themselves. We might think of the carnivalesque challenges  run  by  dark_agenda,  kink_bingo,  and  Amplificathon  as  “tactical  media,”  defined by Rita Raley  2009  in her book of that name. Under the umbrella  term “tactical media,” Raley discusses leftist Internet-based appropriations,  takeovers,  and  interventions  by  digital  artists  and  political  hackers.  She  writes, “‘Tactical media’ is a mutable category that is not meant to be fixed  or exclusive. … In its most expansive articulation, tactical media signifies  the intervention and disruption of a dominant semiotic regime, the tem- porary creation of a situation in which signs, messages, and narratives are  set into play and critical thinking becomes possible. Tactical media operates  in the field of the symbolic, the site of power in the postindustrial society”   Raley 2009, 6 . While leftist  or antineoliberal  video games, network maps,  and “hacktivist” actions constitute the bulk of Raley’s examples of tactical  media, I regard political fan fiction as belonging to this category of cultural  production. Like Raley’s chosen objects, politically charged fanfic “operates  in the field of the symbolic,” “signifies the intervention and disruption of  a dominant semiotic regime,” and constitutes a “parasitic media response”   9 —that is, “the substitution of one message for another, the imposition  of an alternative set of signs in the place of the dominant”  6 . But in one  respect especially, political fic works as tactical media does: the change it is  most likely to manifest is in the minds and hearts of its audience.  Raley states that tactical media “engage in a micropolitics of disruption,  intervention, and education”  2009, 1 . It is the possibility of education that  I  wish  to  stress—by  this,  Raley  means  the  education  of  those  who  view,  consume, play, or participate in, tactical media. Raley writes that she prefers  to think of tactical media pieces as “performances” rather than as “objects”  specifically because the rubric of performance contains  in Raley’s view  an  implicit acknowledgment that the point of the work is how its audience  perceives it. She writes,  To articulate tactical media in terms of performance rather than as static art object  emphasizes viewer experience and engagement. … To conceive of tactical media in  terms of performance is to point to a fluidity of its actants, to emphasize its ephem- erality, and to shift the weight of emphasis slightly to the audience, which does not  simply complete the signifying field of the work but records a memory of the perfor- mance. … Tactical media is performance for which a consumable product is not the    180   Chapter 4  primary endgame; it foregrounds the experiential over the physical. … As the action  comes to an end, what is left is primarily living memory.  12–13   These statements allow me to perceive a direct alignment between Raley’s  idea of tactical media and Aleida Assmann’s concept of “working memory,”  which is synonymous with cultural repertoire, as I discussed in break 1. I  asserted that there is little reason to try to define a contemporary cultural  canon,  or  repertoire—after  the  onset  of  postmodernism  and  the  “canon  wars” over university curricula, there is no body of works that presumably  everyone in a given culture knows, and collectively rereads or reperforms.  Rather, each of us, individually, now forms our own canons, curates our  own repertoires, and decides what will enter our working memory, or what  Raley  calls  our  “living  memory.”  It  is  the  private  individual’s  canon rep- ertoire working  memory living  memory  that  tactical  media  can  change.  The  greatest  “victories”  that  tactical  media  can  achieve,  Raley  posits,  are  not  “any  systemic  change”   2009,  9 ,  but  rather  consist  in  revolutionary  transformation that takes place at the level of the “micropolitical,” that is,  within  the  personal  perspectives  of  the  people  who  engage  with  tactical  media projects.  In  foregrounding  nonwhite  and  non-Western  characters  and  making  them  the  heroes  and  protagonists  of  familiar  narratives,  drawing  atten- tion to nonnormative sexual practices, and encouraging the multiaccented  voices  of  fans  to  be  recorded  and  heard,  dark_agenda,  kink_bingo,  and  Amplificathon try to disrupt the individual fan reader’s private belief sys- tems, which are likely heavily shaped by the racial sexual national regional  hierarchies  of  mass  media  representation.  Reading  these  fanworks  chal- lenges through Raley’s lens, we should measure dark_agenda’s success not  by  whether  the  group  ever  influences  Hollywood  studios  and  networks  to  be  more  inclusive  in  their  casting  and  writing  practices   although,  as  fan-organized  boycotts  of  The  Last  Airbender  show,  fan  activism  can  gar- ner  public  attention  and  influence  the  culture  industries’  revenues ,  but  by whether dark_agenda raises individual fans’ awareness of the systemic  racism of media representations, and inspires them to become critical of,  and opposed to, the ideology of white privilege that informs most mass- marketed narratives.  Raley thinks that tactical media consumption can turn their audiences  into tactical media makers producers coders hackers, and that this multi- plied  resistance  to  networked  power  structures  can,  and  must,  occur  pri- marily in the network. dark_agenda, kink_bingo, and Amplificathon also  have this goal: to turn fan consumers into fan producers, to encourage fans    Repertoire Fills the Archive   181  who read stories about chromatic characters or who listen to an accented  person’s podcast to then write about chromatic characters and record their  own podcasts, in their unique voices. However fleeting, momentary, and  ephemeral   like  performances   such  resistances  may  be,  they  may  also,  Raley  hopes,  amount  to  something  like  constant,  distributed,  networked  critique, which may be the most effective way to disturb, and pose an ongo- ing challenge to, networked power. Raley writes, “If we have only a ‘plural- ity  of  resistances,’  a  ‘being-against,’  always  and  everywhere   with  echoes  of Trotsky’s Permanent Revolution and Snowball’s continual rebellions dif- ficult to overlook , then in fact the teleology of revolutionary organization  is  itself  disrupted.  Instead  of  a  single,  spectacular  disruption,  we  have  a  ‘multiplicity of discontinuous sites of enunciation’”  2009, 25; citing Arditi  2007, 104 .  But  some  fans  feel  that  even  if  the  majority  of  effects  engendered  by  fanworks  challenges  transpire  in  the  minds  and  memories  of  individual  readers, just that change in people’s private worldviews is a change in the  world. jinjurly states, “I think that reading and reacting to things, or even  just reading silently and never talking to anybody about them, that’s a role,  and that’s a really important role, and I think that enjoying fanworks, and  …—‘consuming’  them—is  a  fanwork  in  itself.  I  think  that  you’re  doing  work inside your head if you’re pulling together ideas, you’re synthesizing  stuff. That’s work, … and it is changing the way that you’re reacting to the  world, the way that you’re interacting”  jinjurly 2012 . The most important  network effects of politically oriented fan writing events may manifest in  the form of one-to-one interpersonal exchanges, in the ways that people  think  and  speak  about  race,  ethnicity,  sexuality,  and  nationality  in  their  day-to-day lives, and in the actions that people take as private citizens— even in the seemingly simple decisions that they make about whether or  not to buy a ticket to a certain film, or to add to the audience of a television  program; that is, whether or not to be a fan of a given product. If the “per- sonal is political,” as the New Left espoused  Duncombe 2003, 237 , then  the alteration of people’s personal fannish perspectives, commitments, and  investments  may  have  a  political  result.  The  “cumulative  effect”  of  fans’  “parasitic media responses,” Raley states  2009, 9 , “may not be immedi- ately perceptible” or discernible as revolutionary at all, but may neverthe- less constitute a “cultural critique … invested with a transformative power  … in which one must place a certain belief”  14 .   182   Chapter 4  “RaceFail ’09” and Social Justice Fandom  In  fact,  fans  seeking  to  change  the  minds  of  fans,  especially  fans’  views  and opinions of race, ethnicity, sexuality, and nationality, has been a major  movement  within  Internet  fandom  since  at  least  2009,  when  an  event  widely referred as “RaceFail” took place, initially on the blogging network  LiveJournal and then spiraling out to many other platforms that hosted fan  discussion and publication. RaceFail ’09 began with a post by professional  science fiction fantasy author Elizabeth Bear  2009  on her LiveJournal  LJ   entitled  “whatever  you’re  doing,  you’re  probably  wrong,”  in  which  she  gave advice to fiction authors about “writing The Other”—meaning, char- acters of a different ethnic, gender, national, or cultural identity than the  author’s own—“without being a dick.” The post was widely linked to and  quoted on other people’s LJs, and some of the responses to Bear’s piece also  attracted a great deal of attention and popularity. These included posts by  people of color and people originating from the Global South who pointed  out  the  prevalent  biases  in  sci-fi fantasy  representations  of  “the  Other,”  including in Bear’s own books. Numerous professional authors, as well as  readers and viewers—fans—of sci-fi fantasy texts then began engaging in  debates over racism and other prejudices in both mass-marketed works and  in fan works, these debates occurring through hundreds, if not thousands,  of online posts addressing how people of color, and difference in general,  are depicted in popular media, and how fans of color often feel silenced  and marginalized by these portrayals, as well as by fannish discourses and  practices that reproduce many of mass media’s biases and hierarchies.7  From  2009  onward,  many  Internet  fans,  fan  discussions,  fan  produc- tions, and fan organizations have committed themselves to a broad move- ment  that  many  call  “social  justice  fandom.”  Social  justice  fandom  does  not have an obvious set of leaders and does not take place on a specific set  of websites. We might think of it in the terms that Manuel Castells uses to  describe  recent  political  movements  in  which  social  media  has  played  a  large role, such as the Egyptian revolution, the “Arab Spring,” and Occupy  Wall Street. Castells  2012  calls these “leaderless movements”  224 , and  states, “Because they are a network of networks, [they] can afford not to  have an identifiable centre, and yet ensure coordination functions, as well  as deliberation, by interaction between multiple nodes”  221 . Some of the  “nodes” that make up social justice fandom include fans who post critical  reflections on how they process the racism, sexism, and jingoism inherent  in so many texts of which they are fans;8 fans who document and com- ment on the resistance to discussions  of difference,  and to the points of    Repertoire Fills the Archive   183  view expressed by people of color, that they witness in Internet fandom;9  and  fanworks  exchanges  and  challenges  that  explicitly  strive  to  increase  fandom’s inclusivity and diversity, such as kink_bingo, Amplificathon, and  the chromatic events organized by dark_agenda. Of course, each of these  actions is not entire leaderless—Christian Fuchs prefers the term “soft lead- ers”  Fuchs 2012b, 783 —but the authors and coordinators of these online  posts and events are not setting any long-range plans or objectives for social  justice fandom to accomplish as a whole; rather, they are “moving and net- working, keeping the energy flowing,” in Castells’s  2012, 144  words. That  is, their actions sustain fans’ constant critique of prejudice in mass media  and  in  fan  discussions,  and  disseminate  to  a  broad  spectrum  of  fans  the  feeling that such critique is worthwhile and significant.   Many fans who participated in our oral history project consider politi- cal fanworks challenges to be part of social justice fandom. Alexis Lothian  speaks of kink_bingo as  a kind of formation that comes from pan-fandom social justice … but [is] also really  very much about pleasure, you know. So kink_bingo … is all about, like, writing fic  about weird sex, … out-of-the-ordinary sex, nonvanilla sex. … But the whole frame- work and the way that it’s organized is about—it is explicitly political in the broadest  sense, you know. It says, well, you’ve gotta understand, … your kink is—one kink is  not better than another, … but at the same time, like, we really don’t want to see sto- ries that are using kink in a really oppressive and horrible way. … A lot of the discus- sion on the community is about … how kink intersects with social justice and with  people’s personal politics, or people’s personal experiences. So for example there’s a  lot of stuff about disability, … and then, you know, there’s a kind of implicit thing  which is that a lot of disability kink is very dehumanizing to people who actually  have disabilities, but how do you engage the intersection of kink and disability in a  way that’s actually both sexy and respectful.  Lothian 2012b   Tari, who is one of the organizers of Kaleidoscope, a dark_agenda challenge,  recalls that she was inspired to volunteer for the Chromatic Yuletides, and  to help plan Kaleidoscope, after RaceFail. She says that before RaceFail, pub- lic discussions of race were often disturbing to her, as a person of color:  People would … say really problematic things, like, “Oh but black people are rac- ist  against  white  people,  too.”  And,  “Why  are  they  so  sensitive?”  and  blah,  blah,  blah. And I’d listen to all of this and I wouldn’t speak out, you know? I’d just keep  my  mouth  shut  and  felt  really  uncomfortable.  And  then  RaceFail  happened.  And  … when I got wind of it and I started following these links, I saw people describe  exactly the sort of language that I’d been hearing offline and explaining why that  was not right. And I was just like, “Oh, that’s what I was looking for. That articulates  all these—why that [kind of discourse] made me feel uncomfortable.” You know, I’d    184   Chapter 4  be like, “Oh it’s not really racism because no one’s threatening to kill me or beat me  up or something.” But why this counted as violent speech, and why this was harm- ful—all of those articulations were really helpful to me. And then RaceFail entered  this point where it started getting really racist, and [there were people] saying some  really, really horrible things, … comparing people of color to animals and things like  that. … But … there was this real mobilization of fans of color to support each other  and be support networks for each other. … And I think that was what got me inter- ested in these fandom challenges that do have a social justice theme. Because for me,  it’s—that’s what it’s about—it’s about that decolonization process. In actively trying  to encourage and also to consume fannish works that are about people like me that  have positive messages about people like me.  Tari 2012   Tari subscribes more to Raley’s theory that tactical media’s greatest impact  and  legacy  are  to  be  found  in  the  “living  memory”  of  its  audiences  and  participants than to a Castellian idea that online fan activism will one day  spark revolutionary action. She states, “I don’t even really think of [Kaleido- scope] as ‘advancing the cause of social justice in the world at large’—that’s  not how I think of it. I think of it as like this personal project of dismantling  those  thought  cycles  and  internalized  stereotypes  and  harmful  messages  that you’ve gotten from your socialization growing up. That’s what I see it  as. And I think telling stories about female characters, characters of color, …  LGBT characters. All of these are basically serving that function, to rewrite  those messages that you’ve internalized”  Tari 2012 .  Fans  we  interviewed  averred  that  RaceFail  and  the  subsequent  rise  of  social justice fandom have, indeed, altered their perspectives, actions, and  speech on issues of difference and diversity in cultural texts. For example,  Starlady, who identifies as white American, recounts that RaceFail “changed  my understanding of science fiction and … catalyzed my becoming more  knowledgeable about social justice issues. … I was like, ‘Well okay, there’s  these  people  on  this  one  side  who  are  claiming  that  there’s  no  problem  [with depictions of nonwhite characters] here,’ and I’m like, ‘That’s clearly  not true, so I’m going to identify with the other side. Count me in with  them! There’s a line, and I want to be on that side of it!’”  Starlady 2012 .  Starlady began tracking the books she reads in a spreadsheet, and taking  note of how many characters in those books, and authors of those books,  are people of color. “I have definitely made an effort to read more books  by women and by nonwhite authors. … And I can post about [these books]  and alert people that, ‘Hey, this cool thing exists.’ I’ve also become much  more  conscious  about  issues  of  race  and  representation  in  fanfic  and  [in  other fiction] writing”  Starlady 2012 .   Repertoire Fills the Archive   185  Lothian has noticed that professional sci-fi fantasy writers, particularly  those who attend WisCon  a feminist sci-fi convention held annually in  Madison,  Wisconsin ,  in  the  wake  of  debates  around  representations  of  nonwhite, non-Western characters and cultures in fiction, are “either step- ping  back  from”  discussing  how  they  are  depicting  “the  Other”  in  their  writing,  “or  really  stepping  into  it  and  saying,  ‘Well,  okay.  This  is  what  I’m writing; I want to think about the implications of what I’m writing,’  and seeking, for example, beta readers [who volunteer to read and edit fics  before they are published], who will hopefully, you know, help them [writ- ers] to understand when something, if something is problematic.” eruthros  and thingswithwings feel that, with kink_bingo, they have accomplished  a greater acceptance and acknowledgment of diverse kinks in fandom gen- erally. Says thingswithwings, “What we see in fandom now as opposed to  even five years ago or ten years ago is kinky fic being integrated … into fan- dom space where one of the first things people do with a new fandom now  is find the kink meme. … The point of kink_bingo is to challenge people  to engage with things that they don’t think about very much, or maybe  they even have a squick for, and there’s obviously a big difference between  a squick and a trigger. … We want to make as much space as we can for  people  with  triggers  while  also  …  providing  this  challenge  and  helping  people to move themselves out of their comfort zones when they want to”   eruthros and thingswithwings 2012 . eruthros adds, “And also safer spaces  for people whose kinks these are”  eruthros and thingswithwings 2012 .  Though social justice fandom discussions and fanworks challenges have  influenced many fans and professional authors to work at what Tari calls  “decolonization” and the “dismantling [of] thought cycles,” they have also  attracted a great deal of criticism and backlash. Several of our oral history  participants said that they see a kind of bandwagon or “dog-piling” effect  happening in many social justice discussions, with people tending to hurl  insults at fellow fans for being racist or otherwise prejudiced in ways that  seem  to  do  more  harm   by  “bullying”  the  offender   than  good   by,  for  example, educating the offender about their missteps . What is generally  called “call-out culture” on the Internet is described by some as “the act of  drawing attention to problematic behavior,” which can “involve discussion  and  forgiveness”   Uprichard  2013 ,  but  is  dismissed  by  others  as  “toxic”  and  “a  tool  to  legitimate  aggression  and  rhetoric[al]  violence”   Dzodan  2011 . One of our interviewees, Arduinna, describes how many fans deride  what  they  perceive  to  be  social  justice  fandom’s  call-out  culture:  “They  [people who are critical of social justice fandom online] call the dog-pile-y  people ‘social justice warriors,’ SJW, as people who aren’t really—who are    186   Chapter 4  less interested in real social justice [than] in waving the flag of social justice.  As people who just want to talk the talk and look really good and get points  for being attack-y and dog-pile-y: ‘Oh, I dump on everybody, therefore I’m  awesome’”  Arduinna 2012 .  Tari talks about how some of the critics of Kaleidoscope, and of dark_ agenda generally, seemed to perceive the chromatic challenges as somehow  “calling out” white fans for not being sufficiently concerned with social jus- tice: “A lot of the criticism that is raised about dark_agenda is that it makes  people feel guilty for not participating in it. … I think people miss out on  [the point of the challenges] because I think they interpret it as being, ‘Oh,  this is for white people writing about people of color.’ No, I mean, if that  happens, that’s great, but that’s not the point. If you don’t participate in  the challenge, I don’t care. I don’t judge your social justice cred or what- ever. I—the point of the challenge is for people who want to write about  characters that look like themselves. And to find fic for characters that look  like themselves”  Tari 2012 .  The fact that some fans strongly oppose or mock social justice fans while  others eagerly identify with it makes me optimistic that, at the least, issues  of  inclusion  and  difference,  and  how  fans  should  or  should  not  handle  them, are being openly debated on fan sites—as long as these debates con- tinue, questions about race ethnicity, disability, nonnormative sexualities,  and nationality are not being ignored, sidelined, or repressed in fandom. In  my view, the disagreements and attacks, misreadings and misunderstand- ings, that have arisen around the theme of social justice in fandom show  that both internal, highly personal political work  in individual fans’ “liv- ing memory,” as Raley [2009] would say  and external, highly communal  political work  in fan networks, as Castells might say  are currently taking  place in Internet fandom. The online carnivalesque events that fans stage,  in  the  form  of  fanworks  challenges,  are  generating  change,  not  only  by  filling  fan  archives  with  diverse  content,  but  by  transforming  how  fans,  privately and collectively, think and talk about diversity.   Break 4  “Works” or “Performances”? Break  “Works”   or   4 “Performances”?  What Counts as a “Work”?  This  break  will  explore,  and  question,  the  prioritization  of  “works”  over  “performances,” and of the logics of “archive” over “repertoire,” in Internet  fan cultures.  In Dissonant Identities, Barry Shank writes on the circle of fandom and  performance that endlessly loops in music scenes: “Spectators become fans,  fans become musicians, musicians are always already fans, all constructing  the nonobjects of identification through their performances”  1994, 131 .  Such a scene is thus “an overproductive signifying community; that is, far  more semiotic information is produced than can be rationally parsed”  122 .  Applying this framework to Internet fan archives, we can see that not every- thing, not every performance, produced by the “signifying communities”  of online fandoms, can be archived; there is simply too much production  to effectively save. The vast majority of online fan archives were designed  to save fan works, not fan performances—that is, the archives assumed a clear  distinction  between  the  online  output  of  fans  considered  “works”  rather  than “performances,” and have preserved works rather than performances.  Fan  fiction  stories,  fan  art,  and  fanvids  have  always  counted  as  “works.”  But what of fan dialogues and discussions? Reviews and comments? What  about fan theories and encyclopedias? Episode reviews and clips? Links to  interviews with actors, directors, writers, and producers? What about pic- spams and icons?1 What about “meta”?2 What separates fan productions  deemed “archive worthy” from those that are not?  From Usenet to Databases to Social Media  The  history  of  the  technological  infrastructure  that  has  supported  fan  archives shows that how fandom has regarded works versus performances    188   Break 4  has evolved over time. When I first read the discussions on early  1990s   online  fan  fiction  communities,  such  as  Usenet  newsgroups,  I  noticed  many  posts  asking  for  a  complete  list  of  the  fan  fiction  stories  that  had  been previously posted to the group. Such lists would presumably help fans  know whether or not they had missed any stories, and might help them  locate the posts corresponding to those stories they had not yet read. The  emergence of fan fiction archives to exclusively house stories seems related  to fans’ demand for stories to be separated from other kinds of posts, to be  easily located, and to be preserved over time so that fans joining a news- group months or years after its founding could still access all of the stories  that the group’s members had produced. Many digital archives attempt to  separate “signal” from “noise,” but first, archivists must decide what is sig- nal and what is noise; for early fan archivists, it was apparently a simple  distinction made along the lines of “story” versus “nonstory.”  But  with  the  evolution  of  Internet  technologies  and  the  incredible  growth of online fandom between the year 2000 and the present, distinc- tions  between  “fan  works”  and  “fan  performances,”  between  “stories  to  be archived” and “nonstories to be excluded from archives” have become  less rigid. 1990s fan archives were mostly custom-built single-fandom data- bases and individual fans’ websites containing links to recommended sto- ries,  both  of  which  aimed  to  save  fan  fiction  stories  and  to  make  these  stories accessible to later readers. But the rise of social media in the early  2000s, including blogging platforms such as LiveJournal and Dreamwidth,  and microblogging platforms such as Tumblr and Twitter, led to archiving  formats  that  combined  stories  and  nonstories   commentaries,  debates,  reviews, and so on , that mixed fannish and nonfannish content, and that  facilitated interactivity and collaborative performance between authors and  readers  for example, readers can request that specific plotlines be written,  and  writers  can  volunteer  to  “fill”  particular  requests .  Readers  on  these  sites  are  not  merely  visitors  to  an  already  fixed  archive  of  stories,  whose  responses  to  finished  works  have  no  bearing  on  the  works  themselves;  rather, readers’ prompts and comments are integral to the creation of fan  works, and readers and writers perceive themselves to be coperformers in  what Ernst  2013, 82  would call a “dynarchive,” an archival scene that is  dynamic and evolving rather than static.  “Digital Performances” and “Stone Soup”  Internet  fan  fiction  has  almost  always  been  produced  in  the  context  of  lively fan communities. Although fan writers can certainly contribute new    “Works” or “Performances”?   189  stories to the archives of “dead” fandoms  inactive fandoms, in which no  discussions are taking place and no new stories are being posted , it is far  more often the case that fan writers feel inspired to write fresh works by an  active fandom’s multiplicity of shared performances, ranging from debates  over  the  source  text’s  meanings  to  screenshots  to  vids  to  fanmixes.3  The  broad spectrum of fan performances, in other words, feeds fan works, and  under the definition of Internet performance suggested by the “global the- ater” school of theorists, fan works are themselves a part of the fan perfor- mance spectrum. So, hard distinctions drawn between fan works and fan  performances have always been dubious: many fan fiction stories can only  be comprehended by readers who are familiar with other fan performances  that circulated at the time that the stories were conceived and written.  Fan scholar Alexis Lothian, who applies the term “performance” to online  communications in a way that aligns her with the “global theater” school,  points out that when fan works are archived separately from the discussions  and  other  fan  performances  that  give  rise  to  them,  important  “affective  elements” are lost. Lothian writes, “Residues of digital performances might  include blog comments, IM messages, and the cached versions of postings  taken down by their producers or rights holders. … [A fan] archive framed  as deposit library cannot account for the traces, glimmers, and residues that  give subcultural art its meanings and its feelings. Fictions may be the traces  of lived experience, but, when deposited in the archive, they will be framed  as art—the ‘thing itself’—with the politics and urgencies of the performance  it once embodied slipping out of memory”  Lothian 2012a, 11; emphasis  added .  Social  media–based  fan  archives  may  acknowledge  the  interplay  between readers and writers and make more visible the performances that  inspire and inform fan fiction, but databases that separate out fiction from  other types of fan performances are the largest and most heavily trafficked  types of Internet fan archives today. As a result, large segments of the activi- ties of fan communities—the “fast-flowing” performances that are, by con- vention, not framed as art—are “constantly vanishing” and “incompletely  archived”  Lothian 2012a, 10–11 .  Social media fan sites and fan databases are not always enemies. Increas- ingly, fan communities are using social media platforms in tandem with  fan  databases,  encouraging  members  to  collaboratively  perform  on  the  social platforms, then cross-posting or porting all resulting fan works to a  database for long-term preservation  fan fiction authors, for example, often  use Tumblr and AO3 as complementary sites, using the first for “marketing”  their stories, and the second for publishing and archiving them . I do not  argue that fan archives should merge database functions and social media    190   Break 4  functions. Fan databases that resemble older cultural institutions such as  libraries for print publications and museums for plastic arts—which distin- guish between works and social performances, and preserve the former but  not the latter—serve fandoms in crucial ways that no other format does,  and are highly valued by fans. What I wish to suggest, following Lothian,  is that databases’ design and features mask the extent to which fan works  always depend on fan performances, always emerge from and respond to a  broad range of fan performances, and are, in and of themselves, only one  of many kinds of fan performances. In other words, archival systems, such  as  fan  fiction  databases,  cover  over  the  important  fact  that  performance  undergirds the creation of works, that works are constituted in and as per- formance, and that even the category of “work” itself, as wholly separate  from performance, is something of a fiction.  It would be interesting to speculate about a future fan archive structure  that  could  preserve  a  fan  community’s  totality  of  performances  and  not  only fan works, that could serve as an archival record  with tags, indexes  by date and author, keyword search, and other navigation and retrieval fea- tures  of commentaries, interpretations, reviews, flame wars, and requests,  as well as fan fiction stories. Such an archive might allow a fuller, richer  grasp of the meanings of individual fan fiction works, as readers would ide- ally be able to recover more of the communal activity that spurred a given  author to write a particular story.   Such an archive might even pose a challenge to traditional definitions of  authorship. Legal scholar Rebecca Tushnet  2013  argues that copyright law  defines “authorship” quite narrowly, even though many cultural produc- tions today are constructed collaboratively. Tushnet states that contempo- rary creative works “often resemble the soup in the fable of ‘Stone Soup,’  in which a sharp operator convinces a village that he can make soup out  of stones—as long as each of the villagers contributes a little bit of meat,  vegetables, spices, etc. The resulting dish is delicious, and the stones are a  but-for cause of the soup”  1019 . Copyright law’s restricted definition of  authorship is a bit like “say[ing] that the stranger with the stones is the true  owner and proprietor of the soup”  1019 , Tushnet argues.  Applying the stone soup analogy to fan fiction, we might think of the  appropriated source text elements as just one category of ingredients that  goes into the “soup”  the fanfic story , with additional ingredients consist- ing of fans’ speculations, wishes, interpretations, videos, fanmixes, icons,  GIFs, and art—a fan writer might derive inspiration and ideas from all of  these for a new story, just as any author or artist is influenced by the culture  and society in which she or he is immersed. A fan archive that defined its    “Works” or “Performances”?   191  objects  as  the  complete  range  of  an  performances  taking  place  within  a  given fandom might make possible a far wider conception of authorship or  “makership” of fan works, in which the “sources” from which a fan author  archontically selects for incorporation into a fan fiction story include not  only mainstream media texts but also fan performances. All fan works might  be said to then be communally authored, although there would always be  individuals identifiable and nameable as the writers assemblers documen- tors distillers archontic producers of fan stories, just as there is always an  identifiable director and writer of a collaboratively made film, and an iden- tifiable producer and singer of a collaboratively made musical recording.  A fan archive that stores an expansive array of a fandom’s performances,  rather than only its works, would not do away with the category of the fan  author, but might usefully complicate and broaden current understandings  of how, and by whom, cultural works are created.  But  any  attempt  to  actually  archive  even  one  subcultural  scene  in  its  entirety would likely end in failure, if only because, as Shank says, “more  semiotic  information  is  produced”  in  a  fandom  “than  can  be  rationally  parsed.” The privileging of “works” over “performance” will continue to be  a useful fiction for the foreseeable future in digital cultural memory, even as  more and more participants on global networks recognize that performance  is the stuff that digital culture is made of.    5  Print Fans versus Net Fans: Women’s Cultural Memory at  the Threshold of New Media Chapter  Print   5 Fans  versus   Fans   Net   Women’s Anxiety about Digital Archives  Let  us  visit  a  scene  of  fan  cultural  memory  at  a  moment  before  digital  archives, or rather, at the moment when fandom’s cultural memory tran- sitioned from print media and face-to-face interaction to digital networks.  Between approximately 1989 and 1998, as the Internet became an increas- ingly popular locus for fan activity, fans began to wonder if their history  and culture would survive their mass migration to digital networks. This  question was directly linked to the gender of fandom: women fans expe- rienced  discrimination  and  harassment  in  their  early  forays  into  online  communities, and in the print-to-digital period, there was a strong public  discourse, or “cultural imaginary,” that identified women as the reposito- ries  living archives  and conveyers  enactors of repertoires  of humanness,  who would preserve the essence of humanity against the encroaching wave  of cyborgism and computing culture. This chapter documents female fan  communities’  initial  resistance  to,  and  mistrust  of,  the  prospect  of  relo- cating  to  virtual  online  space.  In  the  late  1980s  and  most  of  the  1990s,  women fans expressed strong feelings about the imminent digitization of  their entire culture.  I wish to record this moment of women’s anxiety about digital archives  in part because, without it, the history of digital archiving would appear  extraordinarily masculine, as the founders of the most prominent universal  archives, such as Project Gutenberg, SunSITE ibiblio, the Internet Archive,  the Rosetta Project, Open Library, and Archive Team, are men, and many  cooperate  with  one  another  or  have  a  history  of  working  together.  ibib- lio used database searching software WAIS, developed in part by Brewster  Kahle, when it opened, and today ibiblio hosts Project Gutenberg. Kahle,  founder of the Internet Archive, is involved with the Long Now Foundation,  which directs the Rosetta Project  it was Kahle who initially suggested the    194   Chapter 5  “hard copy” format of the Rosetta Project’s collection of human languages,  a three-inch nickel disk with an estimated 2,000-year lifespan [Kelly 2008] ,  and the Internet Archive hosts the Rosetta Project Archive as a special col- lection.  Aaron  Swartz,  architect  of  Open  Library,  worked  at  the  Internet  Archive, and Kahle convened a memorial for Swartz at the Internet Archive  after Swartz’s death  Kahle 2013 . Jason Scott, founder of Archive Team, is  the software curator at the Internet Archive  Scott 2013 .  It is thus Kahle  who serves as the primary connector for this “boys’ network” of archivists.   This group could easily be written up as the heroes of the rogue memory  movement,  and  such  a  narrative  would  feature  their  heroic  declarations  regarding the promise of digital archiving, such as Kahle’s statement: “This  is our chance to one-up the Greeks! It is really possible with the technology  of today, not tomorrow. We can provide all the works of humankind to all  the people of the world. It will be an achievement remembered for all time,  like putting a man on the moon”  Kelly 2006 .  While Kahle’s network deserves credit and praise for launching and grow- ing  their  important  archival  initiatives,  a  history  of  digital  archives  that  focused exclusively on them would ignore what it meant for women’s com- munities to enter into digital archiving. In a history of Internet archiving  primarily  centered  on  women’s  cultures,  fan  communities  become  the  clear object of interest: 1980s and 1990s media fandoms were populated  by women who were early adopters of digital networks—as well as women  who resisted the move to new technological platforms, and so many battles  that constituted the print-to-digital transition played out in those commu- nities. The print-to-digital transition, as regards cultural memory, must be  understood as a repertoire-to-archive transition for female fans, as what was  at stake for them in this period was, as we shall see, the potential loss of  their individual bodies and the loss of their collective body and embodied  memory to new media.  Women  fans  did  not  begin  digital  archiving  from  a  position  of   Enlightenment triumphalism, touting the possibilities of new technologies  to  make  tremendous  advances  in  preserving  the  great  project  of  human  knowledge,  as  Kahle  and  other  male  programmers  did   though,  as  I  dis- cussed  in  chapter  2,  Kahle  and  others  also  immediately  recognized  digi- tal  content’s  proclivity  for  disappearance  and  loss .  Instead,  the  entry  of  women’s  fan  communities  into  the  digital  age  was  fraught  with  internal  debates and doubts about new media’s ability to capture, and sustain, their  collective culture and memory.   Print Fans versus Net Fans   195  “Half-digital, half-not”  Between  1989  and  1998,  fandom  as  it  was  practiced  prior  to  the  advent  of  the  Internet  came  into  contact,  and  often  clashed  with,  fandom  as  it  began to form online. Media fandom, the branch of popular-culture-based  fandom  that  began  in  the  mid-1960s  with  the  first  airing  of  NBC’s  Star  Trek  and quickly expanded to include other television and film properties ,  consisted  for  several  decades  of  conventions,  face-to-face  meetings,  tele- phone chats, and the in-person or postal-based trade or purchase of “zines,”  which were printed publications containing fan works. From 1966 to 1989,  fan fiction circulated primarily in zines that were curated and collated by  fan editors, and sold at prices that were intended to cover the editors’ costs.  The practice of making and selling printed fan fiction zines did not end in  1989, but starting around that time, fans increasingly published their own  fan fiction on Internet sites.  It is too simplistic to state that there were two “camps” in media fan- dom through the 1990s, but two terms, referring to different mentalities or  practices—two ways of “doing” fandom—were repeatedly utilized in this  period: “print fans” and “Net fans.” An individual could be both a print  fan and a Net fan; if she joined fandom in the ’60s, ’70s, or early ’80s, par- ticipated in cons and bought zines, but then began accessing the Internet  in  the  late  ’80s  or  early  ’90s  and  became  equally  “fluent”  in  online  fan  practices as she was in offline practices, then she was both a print fan and  a Net fan. But while many fans were interested in having and using both  offline and online literacies of fannish production and engagement, many  other fans were literate in either print or Net fandom, and resisted or dis- dained the other mode. Although the two groups were not only or always  opposed to one another, tensions between the two cultures of fandom— “print fandom” and “Net fandom”—ran high throughout the first decade  of widespread Internet usage. What was at stake in fan debates during this  period was the question of which set of fannish practices would be primary,  and which would be secondary.  Henry and Cynthia Jenkins  HJ and CJ  gave a joint interview for our  Fan  Fiction  and  Internet  Memory  oral  history  project,  and  shared  their  memories of the print fandom versus Net fandom era. Henry and Cynthia  were highly active in fandom before the Internet: they both contributed to  APAs;1 Cynthia participated in the famous Professionals Circuit;2 and they  regularly  met  face  to  face  with  other  fans  in  small  and  large  gatherings,  ranging from get-togethers with a few fans in someone’s home to large sci-fi  conventions. Then, in 1989, when Henry got Internet access through the    196   Chapter 5  university where he worked, he began “staying after work an extra hour or  two” and reading fan discussions that were taking place online  Jenkins and  Jenkins 2012 . That same year, he connected with a local fan group dedi- cated to the CBS television fantasy series Beauty and the Beast, and began  attending their monthly meetings as part of his research for his landmark  fan studies book Textual Poachers. He was “the only guy who went to those  meetings,  between  it  [the  Beauty  and  the  Beast  fandom]  being  fan-fiction  driven and a fandom noted for being overwhelmingly female”  Jenkins and  Jenkins  2012 .  And  at  those  meetings  in  1989  and  1990,  he  recalls  that  some of the members were informing other members about online Beauty  and the Beast fandom via printouts:  HJ:  When I’d go to those meetings, there were two or three people there who were  using the Internet at that point at work, and who were printing out … those discus- sions around Beauty and the Beast on long dot-matrix paper and bringing it in note- books to the club meetings and passing them around. … Every month, people would  bring in—they’d read highlights [out loud], people would sit around the whole meet- ing, and flip through, and read the discussions, and so forth. But it was moving from  the digital back to the physical because most of those people didn’t have access to  networked computers. … There wasn’t a lot of fiction online at that point, but they  probably did print out some fiction.  Jenkins and Jenkins 2012   This moment of in-person fan meetings being places and times where some  fans learned about the Internet from other fans, and gained partial, belated,  transmediated  access  to  the  network  through  their  fellow  fans’  efforts,  reminds  Henry  of  “the  stories  you  hear  of  factory  workers  who  hire  one  person to read aloud to them while they’re working. This was particularly  [frequent in the case] of Lower East Side Jewish factory workers at the turn  of the century, that they would pool their money to have someone at work  who read [aloud to the other workers]. And one of them would have access  to  literacies  the  others  benefited  from.  And  this  [1989–90]  is  that  transi- tional moment where the half-digital, half-not phenomenon really comes  in”  Jenkins and Jenkins 2012 .  “Half-digital,  half-not”:  Henry  here  is  describing  the  relatively  small  body of Beauty and the Beast fans who held regular meetings, at which some  who had Internet access passed around printouts of online fan activity to  those who did not. But “half-digital, half-not” also describes the larger body  of media fandom. I am using “body” here deliberately, to draw a parallel  between  the  collective,  social  body  of  media  fans  in  1989–90,  and  a  fic- tional body frequently found in science fiction “cyberpunk” novels, tele- vision  series,  and  films  that  were  in  vogue  at  that  time:  the  body  of  the    Print Fans versus Net Fans   197  cyborg. Both the body of fandom and the body of the cyborg in the ’80s  and ’90s were sites of overlapping technologies: in the collective fan body,  it was technologies of print and face-to-face interactions that intersected  with network technologies; in the fictional cyborg body, it was advanced  mechanical  and  digital  technologies  that  fused  with  human  flesh  and  blood. In other words, the “half-digital, half-not phenomenon” that Henry  Jenkins describes arising at “that transitional moment” of the late 1980s  and early 1990s, the cusp of the transition between print culture and digital  culture, was not limited to the group of fellow Beauty and the Beast viewers  in his university town, but was a phenomenon experienced viscerally by  thousands  of  media  fans  across  the  United  States,  and  experienced  con- ceptually by millions of media consumers who read cyberpunk novels or  watched cyberpunk television programs and films. Fandom as a whole was  two halves at this historical moment. Partly print- and flesh-based, partly  digital, and majority women, fandom was a female cyborg entity.  Bionic Women or the Borg?  Henry and Cynthia Jenkins recall that the Beauty and the Beast fan group  welcomed the information about the digital sphere that their members cir- culated at their periodic meetings. Here is Henry and Cynthia’s exchange  about that group’s attitudes:  HJ:  The Beauty and the Beast women were [saying], “This is really cool. This is access  to more information. Our community just expanded.”  CJ:  … People were not feeling threatened [by online conversations] and feeling like  they were being cut out.  HJ:  No, it [Internet fandom] was something exotic, and an extra.  CJ:  And that was because the center of gravity was still face-to-face. And there was  just peripheral added richness [from the Internet], as opposed to the center of gravity  shifting away from the face-to-face and onto the digital.  Jenkins and Jenkins 2012   Other  oral  history  participants  also  recall  early  online  fandom  as  being  harmonious with print-based and in-person fan practices, and as supple- mentary  to  those  “real-world”  practices  rather  than  displacing  them.  Arduinna   2012   states  that  the  online  fan  communities  that  she  joined  in  1994–95  facilitated  zine  exchanges  and  meet-ups  at  conventions.  She  recalls,  “If  someone  had  zines  to  sell,  you  would  talk  to  them  privately.  I met a few people that way, where we just got chatting [online] about ‘I    198   Chapter 5  want to borrow from your zines,’ or ‘Let’s trade zines,’ and we would wind  up in these gigantic conversations for weeks or months just talking about  the zines and whatever.” Arduinna and five or six of her fellow fans on the  Forever Knight mailing list often conversed in a private IRC  Internet Relay  Chat  chatroom, and Arduinna says that those fans “came to visit me, we  had a great—We would meet at the cons. We had a great time. It was some  really good friends. And I’m still in touch with a couple of them”  Arduinna  2012 .  Arduinna talks about fans using online sites to arrange for the exchange  of videotapes as well as zines, and those exchanges serving to inaugurate  friendships: “If you were willing to write to someone [online] and say, ‘Do  you have a tape of this episode?’ Well that—Anything could be an opening  to an actual conversation and a friendship. It could be something as simple  as, ‘I missed taping my show—the show last night. Does anyone have a tape  they can send me?’ So, lots of trading stuff back and forth. Lots of physical  material went back and forth then”  Arduinna 2012 . In Arduinna’s telling,  it seems that the back-and-forthing of physical material sometimes led to  the back-and-forthing of physical bodies, as fans who “met” online agreed  to meet in person at fan conventions and at one another’s homes.  In this timeframe of 1989 to 1998, then, some fans looked to the Inter- net as a supplement to, or facilitator of, what could be called “in-person”  fandom. As the Jenkinses say, the Internet was “exotic, and an extra” com- ponent of fandom, but “the center of gravity” of media fandom was still  physical, manifesting in the form of in-person gatherings as well as in the  trade of material artifacts such as zines and videotapes. Fans like those in  the  Beauty  and  the  Beast  group,  and  on  the  Forever  Knight  mailing  list  to  which Arduinna subscribed, were cyborgs, but only just: they were humans  first and foremost, who enjoyed Internet fandom because it aided, or added  a new dimension to, their real-world exchanges and interactions. In their  experiences, the body of fandom was a human body with digital prosthetics  or extensions—a mostly human cyborg.  But other fans in this period felt differently about the Internet, perceiv- ing the new media as threatening to their decades-old traditions of practic- ing fandom through embodied interactions and physical objects. To these  print fans, the Internet was an alien entity that sought to incorporate all  fans into its vast, immaterial streams, and they resisted total assimilation.  I  am  borrowing  the  terms  “resistance”  and  “assimilation”  from  a  major  villain featured in the series Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep  Space Nine, and Star Trek: Voyager: the hive-minded Borg, who attempt to    Print Fans versus Net Fans   199  forcefully assimilate all species that they encounter in their space travels  into their biotechnological Collective. The Borg typically begin their assim- ilatory processes with an announcement to the species-to-be-incorporated  that “Resistance is futile.” I am inspired to invoke the Borg by my student  Lisa  Cronin’s   LC   oral  history  interview  with  the  fan  archivist  Morgan  Dawn  MD   2012 . In the interview, Morgan Dawn remembers the fierce  antipathy toward the Internet that many print fans expressed in the early  1990s:  MD:  That interaction, that negative or “Oh my God. What’s going on?” [attitude]  only lasted for two or three years, before literally everybody was overrun by the Inter- net. So, it didn’t really matter whether we liked it or not. [Laughing]  LC:  Yeah, the Internet was kind of assimilating.  MD:  Yes.  Dawn 2012   In  this  short  dialogue,  I  think  that  Lisa  and  Morgan  Dawn  draw  a  clear  parallel between the Borg and the Internet. Morgan Dawn describes print  fans’ attempting to fight incorporation into the network for a handful of  years before this resistance proved futile, as “everybody was overrun by the  Internet,” regardless of print fans’ wishes  “it didn’t really matter whether  we liked it or not” , and Lisa more directly frames that takeover as a Borgian  assimilation  Dawn 2012 .  In  the  universe  of  Star  Trek:  The  Next  Generation,  Star  Trek:  Deep  Space  Nine, and Star Trek: Voyager, the complete text of the Borg’s proclamation to  a species informing it of impending assimilation is as follows: “We are the  Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biolog- ical and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt  to service us. Resistance is futile.”3 The Borg absorb all physical abilities and  technical achievements of a particular species into their own unified com- plex, robbing those species of a distinct future for their culture. “Your cul- ture will adapt to service us,” the Borg declare, rather than the culture being  allowed  to  remain  independent  and  to  develop  on  its  own  terms,  in  its  own time, following the trajectories that it was already following before the  encounter with the assimilating Borg hive. This horizon of cultural death— the possible assumption of the entirety of print fan culture into digital fan  culture, or the imposition of a networked monoculture onto fandom that  would  obliterate  all  traces  of  the  face-to-face  and  physical  practices  that  preexisted  the  network—loomed  large  in  many  print  fans’  minds  in  the  1989–98 period and informed the tone of their responses to the Internet.    200   Chapter 5  While some fans perceived themselves to be mostly human cyborgs, other  fans feared that they, or all of fandom, were facing impending assimilation  into the collective cyborg entity of the Internet. The Star Trek Borg are a  very different sort of cyborg than, say, the Bionic Woman  the protagonist  of a popular 1970s television series of the same name, starring Lindsay Wag- ner . The Bionic Woman is a human being who has machine parts surgi- cally fused with her bones and muscles to make her far stronger, faster, and  more  perceptive  than  the  average  person;  the  Borg  comprise  a  collective  technological complex that requires all who enter its field of surveillance  to wholly merge with it, such that their organic matter and creativity are  instrumentalized to keep the Borg entity alive and growing. While Beauty  and the Beast fans, and Arduinna and her fellow Forever Knight fans, saw the  Internet as an enhancement technology, making them  as Net users  akin  to the Bionic Woman, other fans feared that the Internet would operate like  the Borg, as a master technology with extensive control over human opera- tions, to which humans and all their output would be mere fuel.  The Failings of Net Fandom  Reading through fans’ submissions to the letterzine Comlink in 1992 and  1993, one finds fans highlighting what they perceive to be three main fail- ings of the Internet: it is elitist, it encourages bad writing and poor com- munication, and it is not an archival medium. The writers frame the elitism  of the Internet as class based. They imply that only relatively wealthy fans  will be able to afford computers, and thus Net fandom will exclude fans  who are less well-off, whereas print fandom is not restricted to the upper  classes. The writers attribute the low quality of Internet prose, in both fan  fiction  and  discussion,  to  the  speed  with  which  networked  communica- tion takes place: “the immediacy” of the Internet “encourage[s] off-the-cuff  writing,” and conversations that take place over the course of a year in a  zine  last  “only  a  week”  online,  encouraging  people  to  post  without  first  “consider[ing] the words that one leaves behind in a public arena.” A sepa- rate issue from the poor use of written language is the speed with which  people leap into heated arguments on the Internet. The writers attribute  the frequency of online “flame wars” to Net fans not knowing one another  personally; Net fans are therefore not able to decode one another’s inten- tions  Fanlore, “Fandom and the Internet” .  The fact that the Internet is not an archival medium  the “ephemeral- ity” of Net fandom  is framed as a problem for newcomers in the Comlink  comments: “It may be possible to download and save BBS discussions but    Print Fans versus Net Fans   201  apparently, it’s rarely done, and few newcomers have access to what has  gone before … a sort of a background which gives people a sense of Group  Identity”  Fanlore, “Fandom and the Internet” . This argument resonates  with one I made in chapter 3, about the importance of new members of a  fandom having access to that fandom’s archives for their own encultura- tion,  in  order  to  gain  a  sense  of  belonging  to  the  group.  To  some  print  fans,  the  absence  of  any  reliable  way  to  conserve  online  activity  appar- ently promised a future for media fandom that had no past, or no way to  access the past. Thus, Net fans would suffer from a lack of “Group Iden- tity” and an “absence of tradition.” Also, print’s superiority to the Internet  as  a  medium  for  textual  preservation  means  that  zine  fan  fiction  is  of  a  higher quality than online fic: “Fanzine writers have at least an eye on the  possibility that people ten years in the future may be reading what they’re  writing now.”  But for each of these arguments for the advantages of print fandom over  Net  fandom  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s,  there  were  counterargu- ments.  With  regard  to  economic  elitism,  Jacqueline   2012   states  in  her  interview that the Internet created a “level playing field [of] interaction”  between fans, in part because it  made reading fanfic free. Back in the days when we could only get [fan fiction] in  dead tree fandom [“dead tree fandom” being a tongue-in-cheek nickname for print  fandom], you were talking about a $30-per-zine investment. And this is in the early  ’80s when $30 was probably a lot closer to the buying power of $60 now. And that  meant either you were dealing crack on the side or all of your money was going into  zines. And even if all of your money went into zines, and even if you were making  a five-figure income, at some point you couldn’t keep up. You couldn’t read all the  important stories in the fandom. You couldn’t do the interaction with the people.  Essentially, for your financial health and well-being, you had to pick a fandom. Or  four.  Jacqueline 2012   Computer  equipment,  from  the  1980s  through  the  present,  has  always  required  a  significant  financial  investment  and  has  never  been  afford- able by all, but Jacqueline’s comments show that class-based exclusions in  media fandom did not begin with Net fandom, as print fandom also erected  financial  barriers  to  participation.  What  print  fans’  allegations  of  elitism  covered over was a fear that the “center of gravity”  as Cynthia Jenkins put  it  was shifting away from print fandom to Net fandom in these years. The  tradition of fandom that had been founded in the 1960s was threatened  with disappearance in the 1990s owing to the rise of new media.  In their oral history interview, Henry and Cynthia Jenkins describe the   tensions that suffused print fans’ discourse during this period:   202   Chapter 5  HJ:  The original community felt they lost control as this stuff expanded. So one  friction is, “These people aren’t doing fandom right. They’re doing fandom by a dif- ferent set of rules. … These people are interacting online with each other all the time,  despite geographic distances.” Whereas the other group got together a handful of  times a year, it was really special, there was an enormous bond that grew out of going  to cons together over time. And those who couldn’t be there [online] every day got  more and more left out of the social interactions of the community.  CJ:  By  the  time  the  con  came  around,  those  conversations  they  wanted  to  have  were just so old hat, everybody was bored with it.  HJ:  They  couldn’t  participate  at  the  same  level.  Their  community  was  damaged,  because there was this new thing that was closer, more intense, more real-time, more  evolving,  that  formed  its  own  norms  and  consensuses.  …  I  think  people  thought  very hard that this was just going to exist alongside the old fandom, not that it would  become fandom.   Jenkins and Jenkins 2012   Henry remembers that Net fans offered fans who were not yet online “peer- to-peer mentorship of technical skills.” He also remembers other systems  that  fans  put  in  place  to  help  them  get  online  or  otherwise  learn  about  online fandom: “Fans donating equipment to fans who didn’t have [access  to computers or the Internet] through work or couldn’t afford it. The sys- tems of printing things out and bringing them to meetings. … In a lot of  ways, fandom dealt better with the digital divide than many other segments  of the population.” However, despite some early Net fans’ concerted efforts  to close the digital divide that some of their ranks were experiencing in the  early-to-mid-’90s, the divide was real for a significant number of print fans. Print fans thus voiced a range of opinions on a number of issues regard- ing the ascendance of Net fandom from 1989 to 1998. I argue that a single  thread tied together all of their concerns: a preoccupation with the absence  of human female bodies from the virtual network.  Missing Female Bodies  How would the female body inhabit the Internet? Conspicuously, as a tar- get? Or as a conspicuous absence, a structurally excluded other to digital  culture?  These two scenarios are tied together—targeting can easily lead to  exclusion.  These questions undergirded print fans’ criticisms of Internet  fandom.  Fans’  concept  of  a  digital  network  that  would  prove  inhospitable  to  human female life drew from, and contributed to, the “cultural imaginary”  of cyberpunk that circulated widely in US media from the 1970s through    Print Fans versus Net Fans   203  the  1990s.  A  plethora  of  cyberpunk  novels,  television  series,  and  films  depicted a near-future in which human bodies, especially women’s bodies,  were extraneous and disposable owing to the preponderance of advanced  technologies,  such  as  intelligent  machines  waging  outright  war  on  the  human race, and sophisticated digital networks that make bodies unneces- sary for action. In The Closed World, Paul N. Edwards  1996  uses the term  “cyborg discourse” as an umbrella descriptor for this pervasive set of narra- tives. “Cyborg discourse,” writes Edwards, includes “practices of computer  use,”  “experiences  of  intimacy  of  with  computers  and  of  connection  to  other people through computers”  Edwards references Sherry Turkle’s work  here ,  and  “fictions  and  fantasies  about  cyborgs,  robots,  and  intelligent  machines, increasingly prominent in science fiction and popular culture”   20–21 . Many works of cyborg discourse envision a near-future of human– machine relations  ranging from complete merging to entrenched warfare  between the two parties  in which “human” is equated with femaleness.  In  its  summer  1989  issue,  the  Whole  Earth  Review  published  a  forum  on the question, “Is the body obsolete?” with contributions from artists,  scientists,  academics,  and  fiction  writers.  Cultural  historian  Fred  Turner  describes  the  Whole  Earth  Review  as  a  key  part  of  entrepreneur  Stewart  Brand’s efforts to bring together “the residual countercultural and the flour- ishing technical” and to provide “the conditions within which a network of  conversations could move fluidly between the online and off-line worlds”   Turner 2006, 132 , by bringing news from the “electronic frontier” to curi- ous  nontechnical  readers,  and  by  fostering  debates  about  new  technolo- gies among a multidisciplinary set of thinkers. Throughout its 1985–2002  run,  the  Review,  which  was  a  successor  to  Brand’s  earlier  publication  the  Whole Earth Catalog, served as a central node for nationwide discourses and  activities concerning new media: it popularized the term “hacker ethic”;4  it  published  Howard  Rheingold’s  article  coining  the  term  “virtual  com- munity” in 1987  Turner 2006, 159 ; and the Review’s editor, Kevin Kelly,  would go on to become the founding executive editor of Wired magazine,  one of the most influential periodicals on the global tech industry since its  1993 launch. The Review in large part determined what people thought was  important to know, and ponder, in the sphere of technology, and what it  thought was important in 1989 was what Claudia Springer  1996  calls the  possibility of “deleting the body”  16 .  Some  contributors  to  the  Review’s  1989  forum  respond  affirmatively  to  the  magazine’s  question:  if  the  body  is  not  yet  obsolete,  it  is  getting  there. Artificial intelligence  AI  pioneer Marvin Minsky shares that “If it  was possible, I would have myself downloaded. Why not?” and opines that    204   Chapter 5  “evolution seems to be leading us to a machine consciousness”  Carstensen  and Kadrey 1989, 37 . Author William Burroughs recommends that humans  prepare themselves for “biologic alterations,” for a radical reconfiguration  of the human body that will ensure the survival of the species  Cartensen  and Kadrey 1989, 54 . Other contributors oppose this dream of “bodiless  immortality”  Springer 1996, 27 : author Kathy Acker writes, “I don’t think  I can even conceive of the body being obsolete unless I start thinking about  suicide”  Carstensen and Kadrey 1989, 51 ; environmental author Stepha- nie Mills states, “Bodies are holy, right down to the asshole”  45 ; and femi- nist porn actress Nina Hartley declares, “Anyone who has regular orgasms  can tell you the absurdity of saying the body is obsolete”  41 . While there  are male contributors in this issue of the Review who argue against “down- loading” the human mind into a machine construct, it is notable that all of  the women contributors are staunch defenders of the body, its utter neces- sity and its sacred profanity. In response to the question, “Is the body obso- lete?,” the female respondents are the guardians of embodiment, the ones  who remember that bodies matter, the preservers of the “natural.” This is a  persistent trope in visions of the future that circulated during the 1980s and  1990s: as the flesh appears ever weaker and decreasingly mandatory in the  face of technology’s galloping developments, women become the “natural  preserve” of human embodiment, the memory-keepers of, and advocates  for, the importance and significance of physicality.  This  association  between  women  and  embodiment  permeates  cyber- punk fictions from the 1980s and 1990s. Cyberpunk is a genre of science  fiction  that  was  founded  by  William  Gibson’s  novel  Neuromancer   1984   and gained global popularity through blockbuster Hollywood films such as  James  Cameron’s  Terminator  films  and  the  Wachowskis’  Matrix  franchise.  Cyberpunk  fictions  usually  depict  a  dystopian  near-future  in  which,  as  Sherryl Vint puts it, “humanity and its technology now share the narrative  foreground”  Vint 2007, 103 ; cyberpunk stories often take place largely or  wholly in cyberspace, and concern human–tech relations. Whether these  relations  are  too  intimate  or  frighteningly  adversarial,  they  are  always  depicted as fraught.  Vint writes that the “appeal of cyberspace is linked directly to the repres- sion of the material body in cyberpunk fiction. … The world of cyberspace  is  the  consummate  world  of  the  Cartesian  dualist:  in  cyberspace,  one  is  the mind, effortlessly moving beyond the limitations of the human body.  In  cyberpunk  fiction,  the  prison  of  the  ‘meat’  [Neuromancer  characters’  derogatory term for the human body] is left behind”  103–114 . But, Vint  argues, just as Cartesian dualism “has a misogynistic heritage”  for many    Print Fans versus Net Fans   205  Enlightenment thinkers, only the male subject may achieve “the transcen- dence of pure mind,” while “the female subject must remain immanent,  absorbing all the limits of materiality that man has cast off” [104] ,5 so the  gender politics of cyberpunk often award to male characters the ability to  leave the body behind for the limitless range of motion of cyberspace, and  relegate  women  to  what  we  now,  following  Gibson’s  nomenclature,  call  “meatspace”  the real world, the other of cyberspace . In Neuromancer, the  female character Molly is much physically stronger in the real world than  the male protagonist, Case, but Case is far more capable in cyberspace—a  difference that becomes painfully clear to Molly when she breaks her leg,  and Case, temporarily “jacked in” to her consciousness, “is able to simply  switch away from the pain”  Gibson 1984, 105 . N. Katherine Hayles  1996   states that in this sequence in the novel, “the character immersed in her  physicality is a woman and the character who can escape it is a man”  118 ,  a gendered division of embodiment–disembodiment familiar from Enlight- enment philosophy.  Cameron’s Terminator movies and the Wachowskis’ Matrix trilogy seem  to make a similar argument for the superiority of the nontechnological but  physically strong woman over male figures who are fully merged with tech- nology, as both texts feature female characters who are alienated from tech- nology, and but are responsible for saving humans against the encroaching  power of machines  Sarah Connor in the Terminator franchise and Zee in the  later Matrix films . In Digitizing Race, Lisa Nakamura  2008  explicitly makes  a connection between the Matrix’s visual representation as overwhelmingly  white and male and the Internet as a dominating force. Nakamura states  that the problem at the heart of the Matrix movies is “the problem of frac- tious  machines,  machines  that  we  know  are  machines  because  they  are  identical to each other, infinitely replicable, and spread in a viral fashion.  So too do we know that they are inhuman because they are represented  by white men, the ‘agents’ … who embody the uniformity of white male  culture and equate it to machine culture. This is how the films portray their  strong critique of information society … machine culture is viral, oppres- sive, and assimilative”  Nakamura 2008, 100 .  Like the Borg in Star Trek: Voyager, the AIs in the Matrix films are an assim- ilating force; the Borg and the Matrix machines seek to denude humans of  their individuality and capacity for independent action, and in doing so,  they  strive  for  the  elimination  of  humanity,  that  is,  of  the  most  human  aspects of humans. All three antagonists are totalizing forces seeking total  control over the Earth  or in the Borg’s case, over the universe . And in the  fictions in which these techno-villains appear, the antidote to hypertrophic    206   Chapter 5  technologization is femaleness. Edwards offers an interpretation of the Ter- minator movies’ uses of gender: in the Terminator universe, Edwards writes,  “Women are the final defense against the apotheosis of high-technology,  militaristic masculinity represented by the Terminator—not only because  they harbor connections to emotion and love, as in more traditional imag- ery, but because they are a source of strength, toughness, and endurance”   Edwards 1996, 25 .  Thus, speculative debates about the future of high-tech, as well as cyber- punk fictions, in the 1980s and ’90s suggested that women would some- how stand outside of technologies that aimed to either “delete” or co-opt  the human body. These texts posit that, among humans, it will be women  that fight for an embodied future, and for the future of embodiment writ  large. According to this logic, it is to women’s—and indeed all of human- kind’s—advantage that women’s bodies will be missing from the absorptive  technological entities that will threaten human existence. This equation of  women with the “natural,” nontechnological human body is enormously  problematic, as it mirrors and reproduces the male mind–female body split  that, as I argued above, has been a large part of widespread misogynistic  tropes  from  the  Enlightenment  onward.  But  it  is  important  to  note  that  a  number  of  massively  popular  cyberdystopian  visions  of  the  ’80s  and  ’90s  “privileged”  embodiment,  and  especially  female  embodiment,  over  and against the looming prospect of a large-scale merger of humans with  machines.  The Cultural Imaginary of Cyberdystopianism  For print fans, the Internet of the ’80s and ’90s was a destabilizing techno- logical entity that promised to overwhelm or incorporate their community,  analogous  to  the  threatening  supertechnologies  that  were  hypothesized  during  those  decades,  such  as  Skynet   the  technological  system  that  attempts  to  extinguish  humans  in  the  Terminator  films ,  the  Matrix,  and  the Borg. As soon as fans began populating the Internet and conducting  fannish business there  “conversing” about favorite media properties, post- ing and reviewing fan fiction stories , print fans perceived Net fandom as  threatening to obviate their bodies.  I do not claim that print fans were projecting fears inculcated in them  by fictional representations onto the actual Internet, but rather that print  fans’ reality and cyberpunk’s fantasies both partook of, and contributed to,  the  same  “cultural  imaginary”  of  advanced  networked  technologies  that  circulated in the last two decades of the twentieth century.   Print Fans versus Net Fans   207  I am using the concept of “cultural imaginary” that was formulated by  literary theorist Winfried Fluck in his book Das kulturelle Imaginäre  1997 .  Susanne Hamscha  2013  summarizes Fluck’s concept: “Fluck employs the  notion of the ‘cultural imaginary’ to describe the ‘inventory,’ as he calls it,  of images, affects, and desires that both determines and challenges one’s  perception of reality”  44, citing Fluck 1997, 21 . Hamscha points out that  Fluck’s “cultural imaginary” functions much like Jan Assmann’s “cultural  memory.” Writes Hamscha, “Assmann describes cultural memory as ‘that  body of reusable texts, images, and rituals specific to each society in each  epoch, whose “cultivation” serves to stabilize and convey that society’s self  image,’ and introduces the notion of an ‘inventory’ or ‘archive’ in which  legitimate performances, articulations, and cultural texts are stored for reac- tivation”  Hamscha 2013, 47; citing Assmann 1995, 132 . Fluck’s “cultural  imaginary” and Assmann’s “cultural memory,” as interpreted and brought  into  correspondence  by  Hamscha,  function  much  like  my  notion  of  the  archontic in fiction. Fluck and Assmann see “archives” of “texts, images,  and rituals” being used by social actors to give shape, character, and mean- ing to the events transpiring around them, and I see similar “archives” of  textual elements  characters, settings, storylines  being used by media fans  to generate interpretations and new versions of favorite narratives. What is  common to all of these theories is a view that cultural artifacts and perfor- mances do not directly impose their logics on their audiences; rather, mass  cultural productions are raw materials for ordinary individuals’ transforma- tions, reenactments, and alterations. People engage with culture as archive  because cultural productions and discourses provide resources for meaning- making activities. Fluck and Assmann propose that reality and fiction often  feed into one another to give definition, a kind of “identity,” to a society in  a specific era or “epoch.” That is, the operation of “fanficcing”—extracting  specific elements of circulating discourses and renewing them through rep- etition and translation—is a method by which people reinforce and extend  certain perceptions of reality, not only fictional worlds.  Moreover, as with my idea of archontic production, when people enter  the archive of a cultural imaginary and transform its elements, their pro- ductions  add  to  and  expand  that  cultural  imaginary.  Hamscha  describes  the  perpetuation  of  the  American  cultural  imaginary  through  individual  and collective embodied practices as “performances.” Americans, Hamscha  claims,  constantly  reenact  “foundational  scenarios”  that  “produce  fanta- sies of national unity and integration, fantasies of an indivisible ‘America’”   2013,  43 .  Hamscha  takes  up  Lauren  Berlant’s  work  on  how  the  Ameri- can flag, Uncle Sam, Mount Rushmore, the Pledge of Allegiance and other    208   Chapter 5  “aesthetic  and  discursive  ‘national’  objects”  form  an  “archive  of  hiero- glyphic  images”  that  works  to  “create  a  national  ‘public’”   Berlant  1997,  103 ; in other words, this archive of images, places, and words holds out  a promise of national wholeness for Americans. Hamscha wishes to con- sider how, in addition to nationalistic symbols, “literature and popular cul- ture” are also used as archives that people plunder for the “construction of  national identities”  Hamscha 2013, 44 .  The identity of “fan,” like the identity of “American,” is a collective iden- tity that must be perpetuated through archontic uses of a shared cultural  imaginary;  the  archive  of  a  cultural  imaginary  consists  largely  of  “foun- dational scenarios” that must be constantly reperformed in order to give  definition and a sense of cohesion to the group. Media fans’ cultural imagi- nary from the 1960s through the 1980s drew on utopian sci-fi discourses,  such as those promulgated by Star Trek: The Original Series, that emphasized  fellowship  and  friendship  among  individuals  from  diverse  backgrounds  who found themselves sharing common spaces in the joint pursuit of one  enterprise—fannish enjoyment, pleasure, and community. Fans’ traditions,  as described in the testimonies of the Jenkinses and the Comlink contribu- tors above, included many varieties of in-person meet-ups, ranging from  local fan group sessions to conventions, and they also included participa- tion in print publications, such as zines, APAs, and letterzines. However,  as  the  Internet  became  an  increasingly  prominent  site  of  fandom  in  the  1990s, print fans started to draw on, translate, and augment a different cul- tural imaginary: the cyberdystopian scenarios of the ’80s and ’90s, which  depicted computer networks as oppressive to humankind in general, and  alienating of women in particular  an alienation that, as stated above, was  not always viewed by fans as an exclusion, but sometimes as an advantage . References  to  Net  fandom  taking  place  on  a  different  time  scale  than  print fandom—Henry and Cynthia Jenkins  2012  compare the “interact- ing … all the time” of online fandom to the “[getting] together a handful  of times a year” of print fandom, and one letter in Comlink notes that “a  conversation that, in Comlink, for example, spans a year, lasts only a week  on the bulletin board”  Fanlore, “Fandom and the Internet” —call to mind  the moments in the Matrix films when the AIs in the Matrix move at “bul- let time” speeds, much more rapidly than the human protagonists’ avatars   only Neo, the only human who seemingly has the ability to manipulate  the Matrix, can match the machines’ speed .  For  print  fans,  as  for  the  human  characters  in  1990s  science  fictions,  faster  was  not  better.  The  Internet  seemed  to  operate  on  machinic  time  rather than on human time, but machinic time seemed inimical to human    Print Fans versus Net Fans   209  modes of movement, expression, and relating. In  what they perceived to  be   the  poor  quality  of  online  discourse,  print  fans  found  evidence  that  humans could not communicate at the speed of machines without their  communication suffering. The Internet not only compressed the temporal- ity of fannish interactions, it also collapsed the space that used to separate  fans. Henry Jenkins points out that the “real-time” interactions of Net fans  took  place  “despite  geographic  distances”   Jenkins  and  Jenkins  2012 .  In  her oral history interview, Rachael Sabotini  2012  describes print fandom,  or “early fandom,” as “like a giant house party. Since you tended to partici- pate together either at cons, or in local gatherings, you know, or in writing  letters and stuff. … Extraversion was required for that initial stuff …; there  was a lot of activity that required you to go outside of yourself.” New media  changed  that  spatial  relation  of  the  individual  fan  to  other  fans,  and  to  fandom at large, says Sabotini. “The technology of having your phone, …  having  the  computer,  just  brings  a  different  aspect.  …  It’s  much  more— you’re carrying fandom in your head all the time now. … It’s in your head,  it’s  in  your  pocket,  it’s—you’re  constantly  immersed.  Whereas  there  was  much more space in that original environment. And other people tended  to fill that space, and it wasn’t so much in your head”  Sabotini 2012 . The  language that Sabotini uses characterizes the onset of Net fandom as a tran- sition that individual fans made from body to mind, from physicality to  virtuality. Sabotini herself was a full participant in both print fandom and  online fandom during these transitional years—hence her unwillingness to  establish a hierarchy between them—but she acknowledges that other print  fans had difficulty with the shift to Net fandom. “It [was] a little unsettling  to the very early fans, because it [was] so different from what they were used  to and how they were used to thinking of fandom,” she states.  I argue that the sweeping change that was “unsettling” to print fans in  the 1990s was, in essence, the same sweeping change that was unsettling to  readers and viewers of dystopian cyberpunk fictions in the same time period:  the change from the body to the mind as the primary agent for meaning- ful interaction, as the Internet and other new media became increasingly  integrated into millions of people’s lives. Cyberpunk announced and artic- ulated, in exaggerated visual, sonic, and narrative vocabularies, the fright- ening consequences of digital technologies’ relegation of the body to the  status of insignificant, irrelevant “meat.”  Against the threat that humans would soon become immaterial  mean- ing both nonmaterial or virtual beings and not mattering or being irrele- vant to machinic processing , cyberpunk posited women as the repositories  and guardians of the human body and of the defining essence of human    210   Chapter 5  society.  Rather  than  characterizing  female  fans  as  resistant  to  new  tech- nologies because of some irrational inertia and distrust of the new, or as  excluded  from  online  participation  purely  because  of  economic  circum- stances,6 I perceive print fans as a group that experienced, in a visceral way  that  had  direct  ramifications  for  their  communities,  the  dread  of  bodily  “deletion” that permeated US culture in the last decades of the twentieth  century.  The Female Body Always Remains  One reason that print fans may have resisted networked “connection” was  that  they  understood,  or  rapidly  learned  either  from  their  own  or  other  fans’ initial engagements with the Internet, that the female body does not  actually ever go unmarked, even in purely text-based virtual encounters.  Morgan Dawn  2012  recalls, in her oral history interview, that in the early  ’90s,  women  were  frequently  harassed  online.  Morgan  Dawn  states,  “We  [female  fans]  were  concerned  with  what  was  happening  to  women  who  were online in the early ’90s. Which were, ‘Hi! I’m a woman.’ ‘Hey, wanna  have sex with me?’ You know, literally, that’s what we were constantly get- ting hit with, when you identified yourself as a woman. And God forbid  you identified yourself as a geek woman, because you would get hit on even  harder”  Dawn 2012 . This accords with Rose Allucquère Stone’s assertion  in 1991 that online communications “maintain the preexisting codes”  14   of  gender:  “Bodies  in  cyberspace  are  …  constituted  by  descriptive  codes  that ‘embody’ expectations of appearance. Many of the engineers currently  debating the form and nature of cyberspace are the young turks of com- puter engineering, men in their late teens and twenties, and they are preoc- cupied with the things with which postpubescent men have always been  preoccupied. This rather steamy group will generate the codes and descrip- tors by which bodies in cyberspace are represented”  Stone 1991, 14–15 .  In other words, given that the majority of computer scientists in the early  years of the public Internet were  and are today  male, bodies in cyberspace  will be described, represented, and recognized—and, one can extrapolate,  addressed—according to “the preexisting codes for body”  14 , that is, for  gendered bodies, that proliferate in real-world spaces.  The alienation from the Internet that female fans experienced when they  began to take part in online fan discussions had to do not only with their  being  women,  but  with  their  reading  and  interpreting  source  texts  in  ways  that are frequently gendered as female. In their oral history interview, the  Jenkinses share recollections that echo Morgan Dawn’s, discussing how, on    Print Fans versus Net Fans   211  the Internet in the late ’80s and early ’90s, “women [were] feeling unsafe …  going into a space [where] they were going to be picked on, harassed”  Jen- kins and Jenkins 2012 . They locate the cause of women’s “feeling unsafe,”  being “picked on” and “harassed,” in the clash between how men tended  to define fandom and how women tended to define fandom, a clash that  took place openly for the first time on the Internet.  HJ:  You had all these different fandoms. If you go back to my fandom as a male  experience  versus  Cynthia’s  experience,  those  conversations  [between  male  and  female fans] hadn’t happened before. So to be a … male Star Trek fan [meant that  you] lived in a world where you knew how to read Star Trek, what to talk about, what  episodes mattered. And women lived in a totally different world. And you created a  discussion list, and you brought them together, and, “What?!”  CJ:  You knew a male Star Trek fan who could tell you specs on every kind of ship. It  [male fandom] is, like, totally hardware centered.  HJ:  [Male fans] knew the command structures, the uniforms and the badges, the  ships and the technology. And had a totally different sense of what episodes were  good and bad than those [female fans] who were into the characters. And so flame  wars  were  everywhere.  …  Flame  wars  that  were  leaving  women  unwilling  to  talk  online.   Jenkins and Jenkins 2012   Morgan Dawn also has memories of the content of female fans’ interests— in “characters” rather than “hardware”—making them feel targeted when  they tried to participate in early online fan communities: “There we were  talking about slash [fanfic], or wanting to talk about slash, which was not  very well accepted in fandom at the time, or at least online. And so we had  all this vulnerability.” The Jenkinses and Morgan Dawn recall that female  fans, in order protect themselves from the “flame wars,” “feeling unsafe,”  feeling  “vulnerable,”  being  “picked  on”  and  “harassed”  in  mixed-gender  Internet  communities,  founded  majority-female  and  exclusively  female  online  groups.  Morgan  Dawn   2012   recalls  that  in  order  to  sign  up  for  Virgule-L, which was likely the first slash mailing list opened and “was all  run for women, by women,” a newcomer had to “give them your real full  name,” had to “sign a statement that no one but you would be reading your  email,” and had to “promise not to advertise or talk about the mailing list  in open areas.” Says Morgan Dawn, “You couldn’t even mention [Virgule-L]  online. […] It was extremely restrictive, but ultimately, [that was] what we  needed to get [it] off the ground.” Eventually, as “more and more people  were joining online—in various CompuServe and AOL and GEnie commu- nities,” Morgan Dawn remembers, “it became less of an issue to be open    212   Chapter 5  and talking online about slash.” But the opening years of the Internet were  difficult for, and sometimes openly hostile to, women fans and their inter- ests in slash fan fiction.  Morgan Dawn successfully overcame the barriers to online participation  that female fans faced at the start of the 1990s; other women in fandom  either  could  not  or  did  not  want  to  fight  to  push  past  those  barriers  of  shaming and flaming. Women’s bodies as objects of male desire, women’s  bodies  as  targets  of  men’s  sexual  come-ons,  women  fans  as  preoccupied  with  men’s  bodies  and  overly  invested  in  fantasies  of  male male  sexual  intercourse:  these  were  the  stereotypes  and  predominant  conceptions  of  female  bodies  that,  as  Stone  argues,  “generated  the  codes”  of  male  fans’  interactions with female fans in the opening years of Net fandom. As stated  above, many cyberpunk fictions and nonfictions establish an unbreakable  link of femaleness to flesh, even in worlds dominated by digital environ- ments; this equation of “woman” with “body” is also highlighted in the  recollections of early Net fans. The fact that female fans could not be decou- pled from female embodiment as they ventured online did not invite their  mass migration to the Internet in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Fan Cultural Memory as Repertoire  What weighed even more heavily against the prospect of “going online”  than the targeting of female bodies online in this timeframe was the expec- tation that print fandom’s collective memory would be erased if Net fan- dom became dominant. For print fans, the fear of the body’s “deletion” that  numerous cyberdystopianists expressed was more than a vague anxiety for  humankind’s future—fans quickly became pessimistic about their own cul- ture’s future. A transition of fandom from the body to the network meant  that the institutional memory modalities that fans had developed would  possibly  dissolve.  These  memory  modalities  were  embodied:  print  fans’  cultural memory was constituted through repertoire rather than through  archive. In the quotations above, one can sense the great significance that  print fans placed on meet-ups, and the idea that face-to-face connections  among fans might be replaced by virtual interactions haunted print fans.  If fans’ bodies never occupied the same spaces, and if the timescale of fan  interactions sped up to match machine time rather than human time, how  would  generations  of  fans  understand  one  another,  and  how  would  the  traditions, rituals, and concepts of fandom be passed down from one gen- eration to another?   Print Fans versus Net Fans   213  Practices such as new fans seeking out more experienced fans at conven- tions, talking zine dealers into showing their fanfic zines  which many kept  separate from general content zines , and exchanging videocassettes with  fan  friends  by  mail  constituted  the  repertoire  of  print  fandom.  Through  experienced fans’ acts of initiating and guiding newcomers, acts that were  primarily  performed  face  to  face,  print  fandom  perpetuated  itself.  Before  the Internet, fans preserved and transmitted their shared cultural memory  through a well-established repertoire that was not written down in a man- ual or widely publicized in any press, even the zine press.  The lack of documentation of fandom and its repertoire—that fact that  nowhere could new fans find written instructions that spelled out how to  acquire fanfic—is attributable to fans’ strong desire to not draw attention  to themselves and their activities, particularly the writing and dissemina- tion  of  fan  fiction.  Fans  wished  to  escape  the  notice  of  copyright  hold- ers of the source texts on which fans based their unauthorized fiction, as  they felt that copyright holders could claim that fanfic was infringement  and  issue  cease-and-desist  orders,  or  even  sue  fans  who  published  zines.  Fans also sought to avoid pinging the radar of “mainstream” society, which  fans suspected would mock and condemn fanfic and its writers. By limiting  knowledge  of  its  customs,  traditions,  and  transactional  methods  to  face- to-face encounters  or requiring some face-to-face, personal, full-real-name  familiarity as the basis for the transmission of fannish knowledge , fandom  was able to keep its workings relatively secret; at the least, fandom was able  to believe that its workings remained secret. Fandom chose repertoire—that  is, it chose embodied methods for keeping its culture alive and growing—in  the years before the Internet, as a defense against discovery. But once fan- dom entered the arena of the Internet, and the majority of fannish meet- ings and transactions began to take place online rather than in-person at  conventions,  print  fans  forecasted  that  the  “deletion”  of  the  body  from  fandom might mean the deletion of the entirety of fandom. Fan culture  had endured only through repertoire; if the repertoire was forgotten and  left unrepeated by Net fans, would the culture as a whole perish?  The thread of continuity that had run through media fandom and con- nected different generations of fans since the mid-1960s, comprising fan- nish customs and rituals that was handed over from fan to fan via embodied  practices, appeared to breaking in the face of Net fandom’s rising popularity  in the 1990s. When print fans tried to peer into the future of Net fandom,  past the breaking of their thread of tradition, they could see … nothing. If  Net fandom did not care to archive itself, and if it did not require new fans    214   Chapter 5  to know anything about its past, then it would be a fandom that might  endure for many years, but it would be a collective without memory.  The Body + the Book  But how can I claim that the primary memory modality of print fandom  was repertoire rather than archive, when print fandom defined itself largely  by  its  archival  component—printed  zines,  which  were  compiled,  edited,  reproduced, and sold by fans? It is clear that print fans regarded zines as  artifacts of cultural memory that held the promise of duration, in contrast  to online fan fiction, which they perceived to be extremely ephemeral. For  example,  one  fan,  the-other-sandy,  posted  a  piece  on  her  LiveJournal  in  2007 called “No More Zines? :- ” in which she compares the short life of  online fic with the endurance of zine-published fic, stating, “Electronic fic  is highly perishable. … Yet, no matter how old my zines get  and some of  them are over twenty-five years old , I’ve never opened one up and gotten  a 404 File Not Found error.”  Print fans conceived of their embodied routines and rituals as constitu- tive  of  what  Aleida  Assmann   2008 ,  in  her  essay  “Canon  and  Archive,”  calls  “working  memory,”  which  she  defines  as  the  “active  dimension  of  cultural memory”  100 , which operates through “repeated performance,”  attracting  “continued  individual  and  public  attention”   101   to  the  reli- gion, art, and history of a society. The Catholic church’s “continuously and  periodically repeated liturgical rites and practices”  100  are an example of  working memory; another example can be found in the Western world’s  “canon of classical texts” being “performed on the stages of theaters and in  the concert halls”  101 . Assmann makes direct reference to Diana Taylor’s  writings on indigenous performance as “nonarchival system[s] of transfer”   Taylor 2003, xvii  and links her own concept of working memory to Tay- lor’s idea of repertoire, equating “active cultural memory” with “embodied  repertoires that are performed in festive rites and repeated practices”  Ass- mann 2008, 105 .  Fans coming together in real-world spaces to celebrate their “canonical”  texts, in local groups and at large conventions; experienced fans tutoring  new  fans  one  on  one;  fans  physically  exchanging  treasured  goods:  these  formed the repertoire, the working cultural memory, of print fandom. Zines  served a different function in the worldview of print fandom, the function  of what Assmann calls “passive memory,” which is made up of the “objects  in  the  historical  archive”   103   of  a  society.  The  written  documents  of  a  nation or a community are “not trashed, because they are considered to be    Print Fans versus Net Fans   215  of historical or scholarly interest”  103 ; therefore they are “stored in the  archive” as “inert” and “potentially available” knowledge, giving them “the  chance of a second life that considerably prolongs their existence”  103 .  The embodied modes for the passing-on of fannish knowledge were print  fandom’s  working  memory,  or  repertoire,  and  zines  were  print  fandom’s  passive memory, or archive.  But there is another way to view the role of zines in print fandom. In  the published remarks of print fans who sought to defend their way of fan- dom from being decimated or swallowed up by the growing Internet in the  1980s and 1990s, as well as the statements of print fans in the 2000s who  wished to keep alive the memory of print fandom, I find that printed zines  are discussed more as repertoire than as archive. In other words, at the his- torical moment when printed matter began to be threatened with obsoles- cence, fans started to characterize their material publications as important  because they gave onto specific acts of reading. Here are some descriptions  by print fans of zine reading, as a meaningful experience, published in zines  and online between the 1984 and 2010:  First, I just sit a minute with the zine in my lap and feel its weight. I turn [to] the  table  of  contents  and  read  that,  plus  any  comments,  notes,  etc.  that  the  editors  might have put in. Then I page through the entire zine, not reading any of the sto- ries, but just looking at the illos [illustrations] and imagining the stories that they are  illustrating. Only then comes the serious business: THE FIRST READING. I read right  through each page in order from the first to the last. I like to get the feel of a zine, the  momentum, because I feel that every editor puts a lot of thought and energy into the  distribution and order of the material.  from the letterzine Not Tonight, Spock!, Issue  2, March 1984; Fanlore, “Zines and the Internet”   There is something very tactile about holding [a zine] in your hands that cannot be  duplicated by downloading fiction off the ’Net.  from the editorial of the Starsky &  Hutch printed slash anthology Leave a Light On for Me, October 2002; Fanlore, “Leave  a Light On for Me”   If you were “raised” on zines, even with all the great things to enjoy on the web, on  the Kindle or other ebook reader, there’s still nothing quite like holding a zine in  your hands. Especially a zine that has the tactile pleasure of fine papers, interesting  textures. That was one of my favorite things about the early B7 Complexes7—portfo- lios were printed on lovely parchment paper that not only looked great, they were a  treat to touch and hold.  Walsh 2010   These  odes  to  zine  culture  contain  numerous  references  to  the  human  body’s contact and interaction with the printed zine: the “tactile pleasure”  of feeling the textures of the paper on which a zine is printed; the physical    216   Chapter 5  and durational act of plucking a new zine out of a mailbox, sitting down  with it, weighing it in one’s hands, and flipping through its pages twice,  first speedily and then carefully; the ritual of ensconcing oneself on one’s  couch  or  in  one’s  bed,  preparing  to  read  a  zine  intensively,  in  the  same  manner  that  one  reads  novels.  In  these  fans’  accounts,  the  zine  is  not  valued as a textual repository or archival document; it is not defined as a  printed form intended to preserve fans’ cultural productions for posterity.  Rather, for these fans, the zine is a prop that is integral to  what were in the  heyday of print fandom  routine experiences of physical joy. The zine is the  fetish object for the print fan, and the fan’s engagement with that object is  a highly pleasurable and personal embodied performance. Let us also recall  Henry Jenkins’s observations of the Beauty and the Beast fan club passing  around  printouts  of  Internet  discussions  and  fan  fiction  in  1989,  which  show that even when printed matter was not fetishized for its rich textures  or fine illustrations, or for the difficulty of its acquisition, printed text was  still a prop for ritual—and in this case, social—experiences. Printed material  played a crucial part in fans’ repertoires.  Thus, the repertoire of print fandom, the working cultural memory of  pre-Internet fandom, consisted of both body and book. There were many  physical  practices  through  which  fans  communicated  their  specialized  knowledges  to  one  another,  and  there  were  also  embodied  rituals  that  centered on printed artifacts, such as zines and printouts of online com- munications. These rituals of finding, buying, trading, touching, handling,  holding, sitting with, scanning, passing around, reading quietly in private,  reading aloud to a group, and other physical interactions with zines were  highly  affectively  charged  for  fans,  and  became  even  more  meaningful  when fans had cause to mourn their fading away, as zine culture became  displaced by Internet culture. Although zines did fulfill the function of pas- sive memory in print fandom, fixing the textual productions of fans in an  archival format that would allow them to be accessed long after their initial  printing,  at  the  close  of  print  fandom  it  was  clear  that  the  more  signifi- cant function of zines was as a key component of print fandom’s working  memory. In the end, what print fans did with zines loomed larger in their  cultural memory than the printed matter itself.  Uncertain Surrogacy  At the heart of these widespread anxieties about sophisticated digital tech- nologies  in  the  last  decades  of  the  twentieth  century,  I  perceive  a  deep  concern with replacement and uncanny repetition, or what performance    Print Fans versus Net Fans   217  theorist  Joseph  Roach  calls  “surrogation.”  In  Cities  of  the  Dead,  Roach   1996  explores “the three-sided relationship of memory, performance, and  substitution,” and proposes that “culture reproduces and re-creates itself by  a process that can be best described by the word surrogation”  2 . Surrogates  step into roles vacated, by death or other kinds of attrition, attempting to  perform those roles in ways that imitate the departed predecessors. How- ever, Roach claims, “because collective memory works selectively, imagina- tively, and often perversely, surrogation rarely if ever succeeds”  2 . Roach  offers a number of scenarios in which substitutes are found wanting or are  rejected outright, such as the surrogate either failing expectations  “creat- ing a deficit”  or exceeding expectations  “creating a surplus” ; the surro- gate polarizing their audience and causing the group to divide into camps;  or the surrogate tapping into fears of “uncanniness,” which “may provoke  many unbidden emotions, ranging from mildly incontinent sentimental- ism to raging paranoia”  2 .  Although  Roach’s  examples  of  surrogates  in  Cities  of  the  Dead  do  not  include cyborgs or automata, they do include other categories of objects  that breach the life–nonlife divide, such as effigies and puppets, and it is  the question of whether these objects should be accepted as if they were  living  that  disturbs  audiences  and  interlocutors:  the  puppet,  automaton,  or cyborg is not—or not fully—a living human, but should it be taken for a  fully alive person? Is the cyborg an acceptable substitute for a human? As I have  argued, this question is especially fraught when the cyborg purports to be a  substitute for the female body, as Western epistemologies from the Enlight- enment  through  cyberdystopianism  have  so  closely  tethered  femaleness  and human embodiment. From E. T. A. Hoffmann’s Olympia to Metropolis’s  Robot Maria to the operating system vocalized by Scarlett Johanssen in Her,  the hypothetical female mechanical surrogate is repeatedly presented as a  deeply unsettling figure. Fans, as a majority-female subculture—a subcul- ture that learned when they first went online in the 1980s and ’90s that  their gender would not be forgotten, overlooked, or made welcome in the  new media but would bear the weight of many of the same stereotypes and  subject positions in cyberspace that it did in meatspace—had much to con- sider as they found themselves transitioning into a female collective sited  primarily in digital networks.  Could a fan culture that was digitally embodied be an effective surro- gate for a fan culture lived through human bodies? This was the question  for  fandom  in  the  late  years  of  the  twentieth  century,  the  early  years  of  the  Internet.  Were  human  transactions  and  interactions  that  transpired  online, through avatars and marionettes  defined in chapter 6 , acceptable    218   Chapter 5  substitutes for the embodied human practices that they were attempting  to  replace?  A  core  function  of  “in-person  fandom”  was  the  transmission  of fannish culture, comprising traditions, knowledge, and cultural objects  such as zines. If cyborg, networked fans—fans who were “half-digital, half- not,” and who “lived” and “talked” and “met” online, but never or rarely  in person—were not going to transmit their culture through techniques of  repertoire, would they do it through technologies of archive? To some print  fans in the 1990s, it seemed that the cyborg version of themselves would  have neither repertoire nor archive. The cyborg would have no memory.  Print fandom feared that Net fandom would become a substitute for print  fandom without any knowledge of its predigital past, and would also be  devoid of any capacity for recording its own digital history as it unfolded.  The Other Cyborg  At precisely the same time that the cyberdystopian thinkers, writers, and  producers developed the cyborg as the totem of a possible future, a future  of  frenzied  networked  production  taking  place  in  compressed  machinic  time, in limitless virtual space, without human physicality to restrain it or  cultural memory to track it, feminist theorist Donna Haraway generated a  very different cyborg figure. Haraway’s 1985 “Cyborg Manifesto” posited  the cyborg as “an ironic political myth faithful to feminism, socialism, and  materialism”  Haraway [1985] 2000, 291 , a hybrid being “resolutely com- mitted to partiality, irony, intimacy, and perversity”  293 . Breaking with  feminists  and antifeminists  invested in equating women with the human  body and with nature and in dividing womanhood from technology and  from machines, Haraway calls for a new, cyborg feminism, a feminism that  aligns  itself  with  “the  breached  boundary,”  “the  leaky  distinction.”  Har- away’s cyborg “would not recognize the Garden of Eden” and is “wary of  holism”  Haraway [1985] 2000, 293 . At the point where body and machine  touch and merge; where nature and culture fuse or become confused for  and with one another; where genders and sexualities multiply and binaris- tic identities and relations dissolve; where “the boundary between physical  and non-physical” becomes “imprecise”  294 —there, Haraway’s feminist  cyborg arises.  Anne  Balsamo,  in  her  history  of  postmodern  feminist  thought,  reads  Haraway’s cyborg feminism as “based on affinities rather than essentialist  identities”  and “rooted in fragmented  identities”  Balsamo  1987, 68–69 .  She  emphasizes  Haraway’s  recognition  that  technoscientific  postindustri- alism is a “matrix of complex dominations,” but that that matrix is also    Print Fans versus Net Fans   219  “a polymorphous information system” that is a “possible means of great  human  satisfaction”   68 .  As  interpreted  by  Balsamo,  Haraway  acknowl- edges and affirms Jean Baudrillard’s, Frederic Jameson’s, and Jean-François  Lyotard’s observations about the shifting conditions of cultural production  in the information age, but reserves a space for the birth of a new feminism  amid  the  traffic  of  massive  technocultural  change,  a  feminism  rooted  in  “fragmented  identities”  and  “permanent  partiality”   69 .  Balsamo  quotes  Haraway: “We do not need a totality in order to work well”  69 . Haraway  suggests that at the millennial moment, as new media shift relations and  flows  between  global  actors,  feminists  have  the  opportunity  to  declare  themselves cyborg, to use the technoscientific “matrix” for their own “sat- isfaction” even as they understand that matrix tries to absorb and control  them, and to form alliances that cross all previously established boundaries  associated with body-based identifiers.  My position is that one instantiation of Haraway’s mythical cyborg is the  female fan online. Women fans blurred the boundaries between the body  and the digital, not only individually but in the thousands, then the mil- lions. They organized and formed associations based on voluntary affini- ties, and in doing so, they created spaces for the circulation and exchange  of  female  and  queer  information  and  production.  Internet  fandom  is  irreverent and ironic, intimate and perverse, revealing of the multiplicity  of female desire and uncovering the lie of “natural” gender-specific pref- erences.  Online  fandom  brings  women  into  close  communion  with  new  technologies,  as  fans  function  as  users,  writers,  beta  readers,  moderators,  list  owners,  archivists,  coders,  site  designers,  recommenders,  historians,  vidders, editors, challenge organizers, fundraisers, and other roles covering  the entire producer–consumer spectrum. Fans created a digital surrogate for  print fandom on the Internet, and went to great lengths to endow online  fandom with cultural memory, as well as community, rituals, routines, and  the other meaningful components of print fandom’s repertoire. Fans have  built a culture of both archive and repertoire on the Internet, a collective  project that has often had political aims—in sum, a project that, in many  ways, has proven print fandom’s most cyberdystopian fears to be fictions.  And yet, even as online fans have attempted to realize the potential of  cyborg feminism, the power and force of the cultural imaginary of cyber- dystopianism  cannot  be  discounted,  not  just  in  fandom  but  in  Western  culture more broadly. Print fandom’s pessimistic prognostications that the  Internet would marginalize the human body, would force humans to ramp  up the volume and speed of their production to match the instantaneity  and  ceaselessness  of  machines,  would  reduce  humans’  physical  contact    220   Chapter 5   and as a result, the depth of their connections  with one another, would  attempt to assimilate all forms of labor and recreation, and would threaten  to extinguish printed matter—all seem like early expressions of anxieties  about digital culture that are widespread today. The darkest fantasies of the  1980s and ’90s about cyborg culture cast a shadow that is currently grow- ing, not diminishing. The two cyborg figures from the dawn of the Inter- net era—the cyborg that annihilates and the cyborg that liberates—remain  operative metaphors in fandom and beyond.   Break 5  A Femslash Parable of the Print-to-Digital  Transition Break  A   Femslash   5 Parable  Femslash as Reconciliation Fic  Between the extremes of the dystopian and utopian cyborg myths that I  explained in the previous chapter, fan fiction in the late 1990s suggested  a  third  fantasy,  one  of  a  loving  union  between  a  human  female  and  a  cyborg female. One of the most popular character pairings in fan fiction  from  this  period  was  the  “femslash”   female female   pairing  of  Star  Trek:  Voyager’s  Captain  Janeway,  a  human,  and  Seven  of  Nine,  who  was  born  human but is, in the timeframe of the series, a de-assimilated Borg drone  that retains some Borg characteristics  nanoprobes and various cybernetic  implants ; Seven, as she is called, is permanently part machine. Janeway  Seven stories are about a romantic and or sexual relationship between an  middle-aged woman and a twenty-something cyborg, and many Janeway  Seven fics from the late ’90s are of the “first-time” genre, in which Janeway  and Seven have their first sexual encounter and Janeway must teach Seven  about human communication and emotional and physical intimacy. Jane- way  helps  Seven  understand  how  to  express  her  own  desires  and  guides  Seven in how to be sensitive and responsive to Janeway’s desires.  Janeway Seven  fics  are  about  two  different  generations  of  powerful  females  coming  together,  the  older  woman  drawing  on  her  leadership  abilities  and  years  of  experience  to  mentor,  teach,  coach,  and  nurture  the  younger  woman,  while  the  younger  one  is  able  to  excite  and  arouse  the  older  woman’s  interest—in  every  possible  way—with  her  machine- enhanced strength, intellect, and self-assuredness.  I argue that one reason for the popularity of Janeway Seven femslash fan  fiction at the turn of the twenty-first century was Janeway Seven’s useful- ness  as  an  analogue  for  the  reconciliation  of  print  fandom  and  Net  fan- dom after 1998. While one might readily agree with oral history participant  Morgan Dawn  2012  that after 1998, “literally everybody was overrun by    222   Break 5  the Internet,” and can easily interpret the history of fandom as being com- pletely  dominated  by  net  fans  beginning  in  the  late  1990s,  the  surge  in  fannish interest in Janeway Seven, following Seven of Nine’s 1998 intro- duction on Star Trek: Voyager, inspires me to read what occurred in fandom  at the turn of the millennium differently.  Janeway Seven  fic  is  about  “crossing  the  line”:  the  generational  line  and  the  technological  line.  In  the  diegesis  of  Star  Trek:  Voyager,  Janeway  and Seven not only differ in age, they also occupy different places on the  human–machine spectrum  Janeway is a human who is proficient at using  technology, but who wars against the Borg that seek to wholly assimilate  humankind; Seven was assimilated by the Borg at age six, and after Janeway  effectively severs her connection to the Borg collective, Seven must learn to  exist as a human–machine hybrid . Janeway Seven fic, then, is concerned  with the question of how two such different women can join together.  Cyborg–Human Connection  Most J 7  as Janeway Seven is often abbreviated  fic begins with the prem- ise that the two women want one another—their felt need to join is not  in  question.  But  how  the  two  can  bridge  their  differences,  and  create  unity  out  of  apparent  disparity,  is  at  issue.  Although  I  am  sure  some  J 7  fanfic includes descriptions of the techno-erotics of a human woman cou- pling  with  a  cyborg  woman,  it  is  not  the  mechanics,  so  to  speak,  of  J 7  sex that seems to interest most J 7 authors; rather, the main question at  the heart of many J 7 stories is how the two females manage to connect  with one another despite each being deeply intimidated by the other. In  other words, the coming-together of two extremely powerful women, who  mutually desire, respect, and even fear one another, drives much J 7 sto- rytelling. Here is an excerpt from a 1998 J 7 fic, “Just Between Us” by G.  L. Dartt, which was the first of a fifty-story series, one of the most highly  recommended bodies of work in the J 7 fanfic corpus.1 In this scene, Jane- way and Seven are on the brink of their first sexual encounter, Seven lying  naked on Janeway’s bed:  Oh my, Janeway considered as she slipped the robe from her shoulders, letting it drop  to the floor. This might be more difficult than she had originally thought. Somehow,  in her fantasies, everything had been rose petals and soft touches, straightforward  with an instinctive knowledge of what to do. No hesitation, no confusion and cer- tainly not the six foot reality of powerful Borg in full, splendidly healthy woman- hood. It occurred to her suddenly that there might be a certain amount of logistics  to this. … She’ll expect a lot more than any man would, you know. …   A Femslash Parable   223  Seven of Nine watched as Janeway slid onto the bed beside her. … It was hard for  her to think clearly. She wondered if there were something wrong with her implants,  a feedback loop perhaps. She was also confused by how swiftly and easily Janeway  had taken complete command of the situation, and now Seven found that she could  only follow the older woman’s lead.  Dartt 1998   In this scene, Janeway and Seven appear equally uncertain of themselves.  Each is simultaneously impressed and daunted by the other’s confidence.  Janeway is awed by the alluring hybrid female before her, as indicated by  Janeway’s  mental  description of Seven: “the six foot reality of powerful  Borg in full, splendidly healthy womanhood”  the combination of “Borg”  and “full womanhood” seems to double Seven’s appeal to Janeway, rather  than making Janeway uneasy at the uncanniness of a cyborg body . Seven  is more than a woman, being part machine, and therefore, Janeway predicts,  Seven will expect “more than any man would.” Seven is literally a superhu- man being, a more-than-human cyborg, and Janeway infers that this means  that Seven will place superhuman demands on Janeway as a lover, as a part- ner. For her part, Seven is stunned—unable to “think clearly,” “confused,”  wondering if there is a technical failing in her Borg neural implants—by  Janeway’s  quickly  “taking  complete  command”  of  their  lovemaking  ses- sion, such that Seven can “only follow the older woman’s lead.” Janeway  is the commanding officer of the Voyager, so Seven may be intimidated by  Janeway’s  standing  and  authority  as  much  as  by  anything  that  Janeway  does as a lover, but Janeway’s innate leadership skills are such that she may  be asserting them just as strongly in her bed as she does on the bridge of  her ship.  In my reading, Janeway is an incarnation, in the figure of a single char- acter, of print fandom, while Seven represents Net fandom. Print fandom  in  the  ’90s  was  made  up  of  an  older  generation  of  female  fans,  women  who regarded the Internet as a supplement to embodied fannish practices  and print-based fannish objects, but not as a primary or central site and  medium of fannish communication and publishing. Janeway can be seen  as a highly positive symbol of print fandom, as her accumulated years of  experience, her willingness to use advanced technologies combined with  a firm resistance to being incorporated by a networked collective, and her  history of command are all portrayed as strengths, for both herself and her  crew, in both the television series and in fan fiction based on that series.  Net fandom in the ’90s had younger female fans as members, women  who regarded the Internet as the core arena of fannish being and doing,  women  who  readily  “merged”  with  networking  technologies  and  did  not necessarily regard in-person or print fandom as more special or more    224   Break 5  important than Internet fandom. Seven positively represents this group in  her advanced technical knowledge and her sophisticated capacity to inter- face with, and manipulate, complex machine-based systems, her supreme  air of self-confidence  arising from her youthful beauty in addition to her  technological  skills ,  and  in  her  ability  to  repeatedly  demonstrate  to  the  noncyborg crew members of Voyager the advantages of being “half-digital.”  The pairing of Janeway Seven therefore is a fantasy about print fandom and  Net fandom joining and combining, not exactly easily, but in a way that  brings pleasure and excitement to both parties. In both the text of Voyager  and  the  “Just  Between  Us”  fan  story,  Janeway  is  impressed  with  Seven’s  more-than-humanness,  but  is  not  afraid  to  lead  and  teach  the  younger  cyborg; Seven is overwhelmed by Janeway’s surety and authority, but that  does not stop her from being assertive, forthright, and direct with Janeway  in their ordinary communications and in their lovemaking.  Understanding  Janeway  as  an  incarnation  of  print  fandom  and  Seven  as a stand-in for Net fandom, we can read Janeway Seven fanfics as expres- sive  of  a  strong  wish  in  late-1990s  fandom  that  print  fans  and  Net  fans,  older female fans and younger female fans, will respect and learn from one  another’s skills and abilities, each one bringing their own unique attitudes  toward human machine identities and practices to their relationship. This  female and queer bond between Janeway and Seven is a romanticization  of the possible unity among different categories of female and queer fans,  which  has  the  potential  to  deliver  to  women  fans  “more  than  any  man  would,” or, at least, something very different than any man can: the conti- nuity, the perpetuation, of a female and queer tradition across generations,  even as new media radically alter how that tradition is routinely performed. Janeway Seven fic reframes “print fandom versus net fandom” as “print  fandom net fandom,” the slash, as always in fandom, signifying pairing,  partnership, eroticism, longing, lust. Janeway loving Seven is a fantasy of  print fans loving Net fans for their easy relationship with the technical, their  understanding of the human–technological relation as fluid and dynamic  and not as a strict opposition; this love of Net fans can overlook or forgive  Net fans’ impoliteness  most Voyager crewmembers find Seven to be quite  rude ,  brashness,  and  occasional  disdain  for  the  “purely”  human.  Seven  loving  Janeway  is  a  fantasy  of  Net  fans  loving  print  fans  for  their  matu- rity, their experience, their authoritative knowledge, and their passionate  defense  of  human  being  and  human  doing,  despite  print  fans’  inability  to fully understand the benefits of human–technical hybridity, and their  stubborn prioritization of all things human over anything cyborg. To my  thinking,  Janeway Seven  fic  rose  to  popularity  in  the  late  1990s  because    A Femslash Parable   225  fans wanted reassurance that print fandom and Net fandom were uniting  of their own volition, motivated by mutual admiration and desire, rather  than  because  the  Internet  “assimilated”  all  of  fandom  into  its  totalizing  collective.  Cyborg versus Human Cultural Memory  In the Voyager series, though Janeway and Seven’s relationship never takes  an explicitly sexual turn, the two characters develop a warm friendship and  deep trust. Janeway and Seven’s bond may have stood for a rapprochement  between those who resisted the invasion of everyday life by digital technol- ogies, and those who welcomed the wave of new media, for many of Voy- ager’s viewers in the late ’90s and early ’00s, not only for fanfic writers and  readers. But, however close Janeway and Seven became in the series and in  fan fiction, they remained complete opposites in one respect: their prefer- ences with regard to practices of cultural memory. On Voyager, Janeway’s  memory modes are embodied. She verbally narrates her “Captain’s Log,”  presumably  recording  entries  regularly   the  viewer  hears  excerpts  from  Janeway’s log as the framing narration of each episode , and on one memo- rable occasion, at the close of episode 4.01, in which Voyager tangles with  both the Borg and another highly technologically advanced race, Janeway  opts  to  situate  herself  in  a  holodeck  simulation  of  Renaissance-era  Italy,  and to handwrite her log entry with an inked quill on parchment paper,  by candlelight. When her First Officer finds her in the holodeck, hunched  over a fifteenth-century desk, he remarks that she is writing her log “the  old-fashioned way.” Janeway explains, “I wanted to get as far away from  bio-implants and fluidic space and … and this feels more human, some- how.” Janeway, like print fans, thinks of memory as an embodied practice   her logs are either spoken aloud or handwritten . For Janeway, the physical  performance of record-keeping is a reinforcement of human culture, and a  refusal of machine culture.  Seven, on the other hand, relates to memory very differently than Jane- way. Seven is proud of the fact that all the memories of her early life have  been uploaded to, and stored in, the Borg’s cloud-like shared memory, and  that therefore a part of her will live forever. She frequently shows that she  possesses a remarkably wide-ranging, detailed, digitally enhanced, eidetic  memory—she  can  access  all  of  the  Borg’s  knowledge  that  she  “down- loaded” before she was disconnected from the collective, and she informs  her fellow crewmates that she “requires only seconds to commit what I see  to  memory”   episode  4.20 .  Seven’s  interest  in  her  own  past,  and  in  the    226   Break 5  past of Earth and of Starfleet, is selective. She understands that voluminous  records are stored in Voyager’s central computer, but she does not delve into  them as deeply or as often as she is advised to. For example, when Janeway  discovers some data on Seven’s birth parents, and suggests that Seven scan  the information, Seven replies that she “may do that someday”  episode  4.06 ; in another episode, when Seven is asked if she is familiar with the  Earth event known as World War II, Seven answers that she “knows noth- ing” about it  episode 4.18 .  Seven, like Net fans, assumes that any and all cultural memory will be  available to her when she requires it, and thus she is not overly concerned  with making an effort to record new memories or to recover older memo- ries. Seven, the cyborg, seems to absolutely trust that the complex techno- logical structures that have always surrounded and supported her—the Borg  collective, Voyager’s intranet, and her own neural implants—are constantly,  consistently,  keeping  perfect  records  of  everything  that  she,  the  human  race, and many other species have experienced. For this reason, she takes an  almost casual approach to cultural memory, not valuing it very highly, and  only utilizing archives when she has a pressing need, rather than to learn  about any traditions that preceded her. In the matter of cultural memory,  then, Seven is an excellent representative of the fan who relies entirely on  digital cultural memory, trusting that its infrastructure can be relied upon  to fill in any gaps, whenever necessary.   6  The Default Body and the Composed Body: Performance  through New Media Chapter  The   Composed   6 Body  Default   Body   and   the   The Body in New Media  Digital networked culture is intensely concerned with bodies and embodi- ment. In this chapter, I will characterize fan fiction as a body medium, that  is, a means of porting bodies from one medium to another. The bodies with  which online fandom works are what I call composed bodies, that is, bodies  that online users make and maneuver in networked spaces. In some cases,  composed bodies are avatars of their makers users, but in many fan prac- tices, composed bodies are appropriated from media culture, and are mari- onettes rather than avatars—that is, rather than representing users’ selves,  composed bodies often represent characters.  Composed bodies are used by fans to interact with one another, and to  enact narratives for one another, in the “global theater”  McLuhan 1970 . I  will build on the avatar theories of B. Coleman, E. Gordon Craig’s concept  of the “über-marionette,” Diana Taylor’s idea of repertoire as “downloading  media,” and articulations of the collaborative and performative nature of  fan production by Francesca Coppa, Karen Hellekson, and Rebecca Tush- net. I will also analyze both texts and paratexts of fan fiction stories, and  cite  a  number  of  fan  participants  in  my  oral  history  project,  in  order  to  think about how writing and embodiment are reconfigured by new media.  A Mystery of Paratext  Throughout this chapter, I will be discussing a mystery that arose for me  recently, concerning the paratext of a fan fiction story.  Searching for a story that I could include in this chapter as a represen- tative work of fan fiction, I read through a portion of my own archives of  fan fiction, collected over the past decade and a half, culled from a variety  of fic archives, representing a wide array of fandoms. My eye was drawn    228   Chapter 6  to an X-Files fic from June 2000, “Night Giving Off Flames,” by Jesemie’s  Evil  Twin   JET .  I  consider  JET  to  be  one  of  the  towering  authors  of  the  X-Files fandom, and many of her stories to be classic X-Files fics. I have read  “Night” several times, but when I reviewed it for this book, I was surprised  to realize that there was a portion of the text, or rather, the paratext, that  I had never seen before, a section that I overlooked during all my previous  readings.  “Night”  is  a  mournful  tale  that  takes  place  in  an  alternative  universe   AU   to  the  universe  of  the  X-Files  television  show,  an  AU  in  which  the  Earth has been colonized by hostile aliens, some of them shape shifters.1  The  premise  of  “Night”  is  that  the  series’  protagonists,  FBI  agents  Dana  Scully and Fox Mulder, partners and close friends, have been separated in  the colonization and Scully has been taken prisoner by the shifters. At the  start of the story, Mulder rescues Scully from captivity and takes her to a  lakeside cabin to recover from her trauma. We learn that, during her impris- onment, Scully was convinced by the aliens that Mulder was killed; then  she was subjected to a nonstop series of interrogations and torture sessions  by numerous shifters who all chose to take the form and voice of Mulder,  in order to maximize her psychological anguish. Scully learned to hate the  face of the man she most trusted. Thus, when she is alone with the real  Mulder in the cabin, she is convinced that Mulder is simply another shifter,  and that he will turn on her at any moment and dispel what she thinks is  the  illusion  of  having  been  freed—that  the  entire  scenario  of  her  escape  from captivity is a cruel joke designed to deepen her pain.  Mulder, who has been searching for Scully since the start of coloniza- tion, is devastated to see that Scully does not believe he is himself. Scully  thinks  of  Mulder  as  “it”   a  shifter   rather  than  “him”   a  person ,  avoids  “it” as much as possible, and continually expresses her wish to run from  the cabin. All Mulder wants is to reconnect with Scully, and to revive their  friendship and partnership, but he cannot penetrate Scully’s thick defenses  of  disbelief  and  doubt.  One  night,  after  several  weeks  of  cohabitating  in  the cabin but barely speaking to one another, the standoff between Mulder  and Scully comes to a head when Scully chooses to briefly speak with “it”  about Mulder as they sit before the fireplace. Scully is nostalgic and remi- nisces about her partner, talking to Mulder as if he is a stranger who did not  participate in the original conversation she is recalling, but since Mulder is  Mulder, he remembers the conversation she references and supplies his line  in the dialogue, which sends Scully into a rage, as she thinks the shifter is  using Mulder’s appropriated memories to imitate him:   The Default Body and the Composed Body   229  “We had a discussion once, he and I,” she says. It nods for her to continue. “I asked  him what divination by flame was called.”  “Lampadomany,” it replies flatly. “Do you have all his memories? Is that one of the things you can do? Did you  steal _everything_?” she asks, feeling breathless and hysterical and missing Mulder  so much she’s almost weeping.  It shakes its head feebly, and its eyes are bright and sorrowful. “No,” it whispers.   “No.”  “Why should I believe you’re him? Tell me. Give me some definitive proof. Give   me something they couldn’t have tainted.”  But it shakes its head again, and closes its eyes, and takes a shuddering breath. “I  can’t,” it says. As it stands and pushes in the table chair, it says, softly, “But he loved  you more than you will ever know. I can’t pervert that. Nothing can.”  Scully does not sleep this night. And she doesn’t think it does either.  JET 2000   Mulder confesses his deepest feelings for Scully at the moment when he  realizes that even his love will not break through her wall of disbelief; in  that instant, he knows that, tragically, he has found her only to lose her  again.  Scully  leaves  the  cabin  the  morning  after  their  fireside  confronta- tion,  intending  to  strike  out  on  her  own.  Mulder  sinks  into  despair.  He  allows the fire to go out and sits on the floor in darkness, utterly lost. But  that evening, Scully decides to return to the cabin. When she finds Mulder  hunched into himself on the floor, she touches him on the shoulder and  looks  into  his  eyes.  The  fear  and  sadness  she  sees  there  prompts  her  to  think, for the first time, that maybe he is Mulder:  Oh God, she thinks. Oh my God.  He whispers, over and over, “It’s me, Scully. It’s _me_,” and his voice is so soft   and frightened the words seem dissolved by tears. …  “Mulder, it’s me,” she whispers brokenly. “It’s me, too.”  JET 2000   JET concludes “Night” here, with the words, “An end,” the same line with  which she closes all of her stories.  But,  when  I  reread  “Night”  a  few  weeks  ago,  the  mystery  arose:  after  reaching  “An  end,”  I  noticed  for  the  first  time  that  there  was  additional  text, at the foot of the web page. Here is that additional text, which I had  ignored in all my previous encounters with this story:  Improv Elements  Thanks, guys.    *  Mulder losing his gun  again  on a case somewhere snowy, and defending him- self with snowballs instead. From: Lori Daul *  A tango. From: Ambress *  Scully wearing a pair of Frohike’s fingerless gloves.

From: Prianka Nandy *  Mulder, Scully and Skinner in a hot tub. Suits are optional. From: dksm  Hey, they said I could use the elements any way I chose. ::blinking innocently::    JET 2000   What  this  list  of  “Improv  Elements”  told  me  is  that  “Night  Giving  Off  Flames”  was  specifically  written  in  response  to  a  writing  challenge  put   forth by some X-Files fan friends of JET’s. Evidently, the challenge was for  JET  to  write  a  story,  as  an  “improv”  or  “improvisation,”  incorporating  a  number of seemingly random story elements, each suggested by a different  fan. After seeing the “Improv Elements” items, I glanced up to the story  “headers,” the text that precedes the story, at the top of the web page; in the  headers, authors usually place all information that they think is relevant to  orienting the reader. I quickly scanned the headers for “Night,” which read  as follows:  Night Giving Off Flames By Jesemie’s Evil Twin [JET’s email addresses] Summary: “Yet from those flames no light, but rather darkness visible.” —John Milton Disclaimer:2 Not mine. Grr. Category: Angst, Oddness, M S [Mulder Scully]. Quasi-Post-Colonization AU that occurs sometime after “Hollywood AD.” Oddness.  One wee-tiny spoiler for “HAD” and hardly any others whatsoever. Did I mention  it’s Odd? Thank You: Shari and Liza. Mwa! You rock. Feedback:  Would  be  lovely,  please  and  thank  you.  [author’s  email  addresses]   JET  2000   Then I read the final lines of the headers:  Scullyfic Improv  elements given at end  June 2000  JET 2000   I had never before read these lines in the headers for “Night,” just as I had  never read the list of “Improv Elements” at the foot of the story. The words  “Scullyfic  Improv”  refer  to  an  event  that  occurred  weekly  on  Scullyfic,  a  popular mailing list focusing on the Dana Scully character, founded in 1998  by renowned X-Files fan author Jill Selby  Fanlore, “Scullyfic” . Because I  had overlooked the last line of the headers and the entire last section of  text of “Night Giving Off Flames,” I had never realized that the story was    The Default Body and the Composed Body   231  written when JET was selected as the Scullyfic Improv author-of-the-week,  a selection that came with the task of weaving the story elements suggested  by other mailing list members into a new story, to be completed and posted  the following week.  It surprised me greatly to learn that “Night” was a Scullyfic Improv story,  for three reasons. First, “Night” seems so well-crafted to me that I find it  hard to believe that JET composed the piece in a single week. Of course,  many fan authors write quickly, but it is difficult for most writers to achieve  the  refinement  and  depth  that  I  think  JET  achieves  in  “Night”  in  seven  days. Second, the list of Improv Elements that JET received from other fans,  and which she had to place somewhere in her story, seem either comical   Mulder defending himself with snowballs, Richard Gere calling Scully  or  kinky  Mulder and Scully in a hot tub with their supervisor, Agent Skinner ,  and thus completely antithetical to the tone of “Night,” which is a somber  story about wartime captivity, psychological torture, post-traumatic stress,  and grief.  The final reason that I was shocked to read that “Night” was written as  an Improv is that I cannot believe how thoroughly I ignored the author’s  clear indications, in the story headers and “footers,” that this was the case.  Why did I never attend to these sections of paratext before? Gerard Genette   1997  argues that “the main issue for the paratext is … to ensure for the text  a destiny consistent with the author’s purpose”  407 , this purpose being  “to ensure that the text is read properly”  197 , however the author would  define a “proper” reading. And thus, by overlooking all references to the  improvisatory nature of “Night” contained in JET’s preface and postface,  I have to acknowledge the likelihood that for many years, I have read this  story improperly. I must not have correctly or adequately understood what  “Night Giving Off Flames” is, which is a story that emerged from a struc- tured, regularly recurring group writing ritual in a fan community, a ritual  that its founders chose to name after a type of live performance: improvi- sation. JET marks the story, in two places, as bearing a specific relation to  improvisational theater, and so to read the story “properly” would mean to  take this relation to theater, to embodied performance, into account.  What  would  it  mean  to  take  into  account,  that  is,  to  take  seriously,  to  count as noteworthy and significant, that this fan fiction story links itself to  improv theater? It would mean, first of all, recognizing that some key char- acteristics of improvised performance can be found in the online improv  challenge  that  gave  rise  to  “Night.”  Hazel  Smith  and  Roger  Dean   1997   state, “Improvisation … provides a tool for collaboration between several  individuals, be they creators, performers or audience participants”  4 . In a    232   Chapter 6  live improv show, there is typically collaboration between the performers  and the audience when audience members call out themes, phrases, char- acters, or scenarios to the stage, and the improv artists work to spontane- ously weave these suggestions into their sketches.3 Similarly, JET received  suggestions from her fellow X-Files fans and incorporated all of them into  the fic she wrote in one week. Although the seven days that JET was given  to  write  “Night”  makes  her  experience  far  different  than  that  of  a  stage  improv  performance  troupe,  which  must  respond  to  audiences’  prompts  within minutes, the fact that the Scullyfic site chose to title its time-limited  writing  assignments  “Improv  Challenges”  speaks  to  the  desire  of  online  fans to create group experiences of immediacy, spontaneity, and urgency,  experiences similar to live and in-person improvisatory performances.  Many of the “Improv Elements” given for “Night” make their appear- ances in the story as flashbacks, when Scully or Mulder recall the adven- tures  they  had,  before  the  alien  colonization,  investigating  weird  and  strange phenomena as FBI agents. At one point in the story, Scully remem- bers “Mulder defending himself with snowballs” as they were both being  chased by vampires in Vermont; at another point, Mulder flips through his  old journal and finds a note that was once passed to Scully in a meeting,  stating “Richard Gere’s on line two,” which was a coded message informing  her that their supervisor, Skinner, was calling regarding an urgent matter. In  the same journal, Mulder spies a photograph taken of him, Scully, and Skin- ner standing  clothed  in an empty hot tub in the middle of a showroom,  all three examining a huge cocoon containing an unknown creature hang- ing from the ceiling. Thus, by liberally using the device of flashbacks, JET  managed to integrate the highly disparate, and mostly very lighthearted,  elements provided to her by her “audience”—the fans who were eager to  read the story that she would create from their suggestions—into her fic,  relegating these humorous moments to Mulder and Scully’s past, while the  narrative present, the time in which “Night” takes place, is permeated by  sorrow and despair for the protagonists.  Another  characteristic  of  improvisational  performance,  according  to  Smith and Dean  1997, 4 , is that “an audience can often recognise that  improvisation is taking place. This knowledge … encourages an enthusiastic  response which is otherwise sometimes lacking. An audience sympathetic  to the risk-taking of performers is a supportive one.” Here, too, a relation  between improvisational theater and JET’s writing “Night” as an “improv  fic” can be inferred: we can assume that the Scullyfic mailing list members,  those who contributed story suggestions to JET and those who simply read  the improv challenge as it was launched on the mailing list, understood    The Default Body and the Composed Body   233  the “risk” that JET undertook when she accepted the challenge. JET did not  know what elements would be suggested to her, and so she did not know  what she would have to incorporate into her story. Like the audience of a  live improv performance, JET’s readers were probably highly appreciative of  JET’s willingness to have story requirements imposed on her by others, and  of her attempt to write a viable story under strict time constraints.  The Scullyfic mailing list is no longer accessible, so I have no evidence as  to whether JET’s improvisational effort met with “an enthusiastic response”  from a “sympathetic” and “supportive” audience. However, we do have evi- dence that the author felt a connection with the fans who gave her sugges- tions  requirements  for her improv, as she addresses them with gratitude   which may or may not be sarcastic  and a grin  “Thanks guys.  ”  in her  postface. She also addresses members of her audience who were not a part  of the group that proposed the “Improv Elements”: “Hey, they said I could  use the elements any way I chose. ::blinking innocently::”. And she thanks  a pair of individuals  “Shari and Liza”  who may have helped her in some  way with the story, perhaps by beta reading;4 she blows them a kiss in text:  “Mwa!”  Thus,  in  addition  to  the  structural  resemblances  between  live  improv  and  the  online  Scullyfic  Improv  challenge   the  artist audience  collabora- tion and the enthusiasm of the audience for the improviser , we have ana- logues of physical gestures included in the paratexts of “Night”—the author  grins and blinks and blows kisses at her readers. She also growls at them, in  humorously  expressing  her  unhappiness  at  not  being  the  legal  owner  of  The X-Files in her disclaimer: “Not mine. Grr.” There is thus a reference to  a body in these paratexts, the author’s body, or rather, the author’s face, a  face that communicates the author’s feelings, intentions, and moods to the  reader through economical combinations of text and punctuation.  What are we to make of these allusions to, and explicit invocations of,  live performance and physical expression in the paratexts surrounding this  Internet fan fiction story? Should we think of JET’s, and her fellow fans’,  collaborative participation in the Scullyfic Improv challenge as like improv  theater, but not really improv theater, since obviously JET’s story consists of  HTML read as words by her geospatially diffused readers on their screens,  and not a set of physical and vocal actions executed in front of her audi- ence’s seated bodies? Should we discount the expressions communicated by  JET’s virtual face because the grin and kiss and growl are not made by a  mouth that readers can see or hear, and the blinking is not performed by  eyes that readers can meet with their own gazes?   234   Chapter 6  It is probable that the body of the Internet fan author and the bodies of  her readers do not physically interact in an event such as an improv writing  challenge  like  the  Scullyfic  Improv.  Nevertheless,  I  am  certain  that  there  is embodied interaction between the writer and the readers. In fact, I would  say that Internet fan fiction, a genre comprising narrative texts distributed  via digital networks and accessed on computer screens, is a body medium. A  body medium mediates between physical bodies that are remote from one  another. My thinking on body mediums media builds on Beth Coleman’s   2011  theory of avatar communication in “X-reality.”  The Body in X-Reality  “My assessment is that networked media, as a whole, simulates presence.  … Being here does not rely exclusively on a physical instantiation. In other  words, neither geographic territory nor corporeal embodiment stand as the  exclusive indication of being somewhere, or being present. I am not argu- ing for an equivalence of lived, bodily experience with our experience of  being filtered through an avatar  our networked proxies . I am arguing for  recognition of porous spheres of engagement that meet across a continuum  of the actual”  Coleman 2011, 36 . In this quote, Beth Coleman lays out the  major claim of her book, Hello Avatar: that “reality,” inclusive of phenom- ena bearing names such as the “real world,” “real life,” and “really there,”  is now mixed.5 Since at least the advent of networked computing, humans  have become accustomed to repeatedly having “the sense of being in two  places  at  once,”  experiencing  “an  interlacing  of  virtual  and  real  experi- ences”  19 . Coleman calls the crossing between virtual and real presence,  and the uncertainty of what is produced at that crossing, “X-reality.” She  writes, “X-reality describes a world that is no longer distinctly virtual or real  but, instead, representative of a diversity of network combinations. … With  the concept of X-reality, I see … an end of the binary logic of virtual and  real. What has emerged from our collective use of networked technologies  is an engagement that moves across sites that are real, simulated, and vari- ously augmented”  19–20 .  Many of Coleman’s examples of “the sensation of being together across  lines of mediation, which is called ‘copresence’”  25 , consist of real-time,  avatar-based  interactions,  such  as  two  Second  Life  users  waving  to  one  another  through  their  designated  digital  forms.  But  I  extend  “X-reality”  to instances that are asynchronous, and not avatar-based in the way that  Second Life is. I argue that online improvisatory writing challenges, such  as the weekly Scullyfic Improvs from the late 1990s and early 2000s, were    The Default Body and the Composed Body   235  just as much examples of people coming together, being together, and doing  together, as any event that transpired in Second Life. In fact, given Second  Life’s clunkiness, its frequent lag times, and its plastic-looking avatars with  their jerky motions, I would say that the networked text-based collabora- tions of the 1990s, beginning with collaborative text-based game spaces such  as  MUDs   multi-user  dungeons   and  MOOs   MUDs,  object  oriented   and  ending with online fan fiction communities such as Scullyfic, were equally  or more convincing to users as a mixed reality than Second Life and other  visually rendered, real-time virtual spaces from the early-to-mid-2000s.  Coleman  acknowledges  that,  while  she,  as  a  Second  Life  participant,  could ignore that platform’s “hitches and glitches”  22  and feel immersed  in  the  communities  that  sprung  up  there,  “perfect  simulation  is  not  a  baseline  requirement  for  meaningful  communication”   31 .  Even  when  Internet  users  have  been  limited  to  quite  slow  and  low-resolution  forms  of networked communication, they have “seize[d] upon the opportunities  to extend sites of connectivity and bring, with all manner of resourceful- ness, a great capacity to weed through the noisiness of a media signal to  find the message being sent”  31 . On the one hand, we can interpret JET’s  laconic “facial” expressions, her   and her ::blinking innocently::, as digi- tal gestures that her readers did not need any visual cues to comprehend— JET  found  a  way  to  send  visual,  physical  messages  through  a  nonvisual  medium,  and  her  readers  figured  out  how  to  decode,  how  to  “see,”  the  faces that JET was making. On the other hand, I would say JET’s delivering a  facial performance through text in 2000 was a faster, crisper way of commu- nicating “physically” than most of today’s synchronous video-based appli- cations permit—there is an ease and speed of expressiveness, even physical  expressiveness,  that  text  can  achieve  that  networked  video  still  cannot.  Until Skype, Google Hangout, FaceTime, and other video chat software can  represent human faces and bodies to one another with a clarity and instan- taneity that replicates that experienced in the “real world,” where people  are “face to face” with one another, networked text  or voice—let us not  forget the benefits of clear telephonic connections  may be preferable to  video as a body medium.  Networked  text  functions  as  a  body  medium  in  that  it  brings  bodies  together  in  a  mixed  reality   X-reality   space  and  represents  them  to  one  another. JET’s grinning and blinking to her readers is an example of one  user communicating bodily gestures to many users. Another, more contem- porary example is the use of emoticons and “emoji”  the Japanese term for  ideograms of “smileys” or smiley faces  in SMS  Short Message Service  or  mobile texting, in which users convey their feelings to one another using    236   Chapter 6  digital faces or other body-representing icons. Through abbreviations such  as  “LOL,”  “LMAO,”  and  “ROTFL,”  commonly  used  in  email  and  texting  and  first  popularized  in  early  online  Usenet  newsgroups,  users  indicate  to one another that they are laughing, perhaps loudly, perhaps so loudly  that the force of their laughter has sent them proverbially tumbling to the  floor, where they are still rolling around, laughing. The mental images of  bodily  movements  and  actions  conjured  by  electronic  text  are  crucial  to  networked communication; body representations permeate all manner of  Internet writing.  When a person “is online,” or “on email,” or “on their phone,” she is  experiencing what it is to be in X-reality. What defines this mode of being  is the simultaneous use of two bodies. In the “real” world, the user has a  visible, physical body that is largely un der utilized, used only for the pur- pose of remaining still, often reduced to eyes, wrists, thumbs, and fingers,  which we might call her default body. In the “virtual” world, the user has a  body composed of letters, punctuation marks, icons, photos, animations,  graphically rendered humanoid figures, or video of physical bodies, which  we might call her composed body.  I choose the term “default” for the physical human body for an intuitive  reason: the body into which each person is born is the body that they can- not escape, and into that body, no one else can enter; it is hers, and hers  alone,  by  default.  My  use  of  “default”  also  stems  from  Bernard  Stiegler’s   1998  use of “default” in his essay “The Fault of Epimetheus”  in Technics  and Time, vol. 1 . The essay focuses on the myth of Prometheus, the Greek  Titan who brought fire from the realm of the gods to humankind and was  severely punished by for this crime. Stiegler, interpreting Plato’s Protagoras,  which offers one version of the Prometheus story, relates that, at the dawn  of creation, Prometheus  meaning: forethought  had to give humans the  gift of fire to remedy a mistake made by his brother, Epimetheus  meaning:  afterthought : Epimetheus had been charged with distributing all possible  talents and abilities to all of the creatures of the world, but after Epimetheus  had given out all powers to the various animals, he realized he had forgot- ten to save anything to give to humans. Writes Stiegler  1998, 114 , “Man  arrives because of something forgotten by Epimetheus, who had distributed  ‘all  the  qualities,’  leaving  man  naked,  in  default  of  being,  having  yet  to  begin being: his condition will be to supplement this default of origin by  procuring for himself prostheses, instruments.” Stiegler regards the state of  human being as a state of inherent default, of always needing technics, of  never  being  sufficient  without  tools,  without  prostheses,  without  instru- ments.  The  “originary  default”  that  humans  have  always  perceived  in    The Default Body and the Composed Body   237  themselves  mythologized in the Prometheus Epimetheus story of creation,  in which humans must “steal,” or have stolen for them, fire from the gods  in order to begin to be human  has driven humans to be technical, to pro- duce and hybridize with technics from the start of human history.  Thus, by calling the physical human body “the default body,” I mean  that the human body is always, and has always been, searching for tech- nological supplements, augmentations, alternate incarnations, mediations.  The default body yearns for composed bodies. Humans require both bodies  of nature and bodies of techne for their being human. This is in opposition  to a view of human being that rejects the necessity of mediation, which  was thoroughly articulated by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and still thrives today:  “Rousseau, precisely, wants to show that there is no originary default, no  prostheses,  that  the  claws  missing  in  man  …  [are]  not  inscribed  in  any  process of mediation. The man of nature, without prostheses, is robust, as  robust as man can be—and it is civilization that will weaken him”  Stiegler  1998, 115 . If humans are not in default, then technics only weaken them;  but by conceptualizing the sense of being-in-default as the defining feature  of human being, we can embrace the drive for technical augmentation and  transformation that humans have always sought.  Just  prior  to  the  rise  of  digital  technologies,  John  Fiske  took  note  of  humans’  enthusiasm  for  the  multiplication  of  their  bodies  via  media:  observing  a  1994  live  televised  news  event  featuring  massive  crowds  of  people,6 Fiske  1996  wrote, “On seeing themselves on their own TVs, they  waved  to  themselves,  for  postmodern  people  have  no  problem  in  being  simultaneously and indistinguishably livepeople and mediapeople”  264 .  Composed  bodies  are  not  exclusive  to  television  or  digital  media,  but  in  electronic media spaces, composed bodies proliferate, and the plurality of  embodiment becomes a norm.  Even though only “mediapeople,” that is, users’ composed bodies, meet  in X-reality, they do meet, often, and do things together, such as prod one  another to write fan fiction stories at certain times, and demand that cer- tain semiabsurd and seemingly incompatible elements be incorporated into  them.  And  who,  or  what  body,  performs  these  tasks  put  to  them  in  the  electronic spaces and events where composed bodies gather and hang out?  The default bodies must apply fingers to keyboards and actually write the  stories, but it is the composed bodies that “present” the finished stories to  their comrades and followers—their audiences—on the mailing list or in  the  archive.  It  is  JET’s  composed  body  that  announces,  in  the  preface  to  “Night,” that “Night” is the result of an improv writing challenge, and it  is JET’s composed body that, in the postface to the story, expresses thanks,    238   Chapter 6  and grins, and blinks innocently. It is the composed body that rolls on the  floor, laughing out loud. The default body may be sitting, expressionless,  while the composed body guffaws, howls, and tumbles about in such a way  that its addressees in X-reality can “hear” and “see” it.  Sometimes, the composed body strongly evokes and echoes the default  body: legions of posts on social media sites, blogs, and vlogs describe, some- times in great detail, physical bodily events such as a baby’s diaper disasters,  a cancer victim’s illness, or a transgender person’s pre- and post-op experi- ences.  Internet  readers  and  viewers  of  these  posts  feel  that  they  become  familiar with the default bodies of the posters by coming into contact with  their electronic representations, their composed bodies  which again, are  pixels  on  screens,  whether  the  pixels  form  texts  or  images,  whether  the  pixels are taken from life or not . As I mentioned in break 0, a great deal  of scholarly literature on performance and new media concentrates on the  many ways that users “perform the self” online, through first-person post- ings or references to real-world events, and even though many of these self- presentations can be quite far from the “reality” of posters’ default bodies   both Stone [1991] and Waskul [2005] give examples of men “passing” as  women in online chat rooms , they can make other users believe in their  reality.  But  the  composed  body  that  LOLs  or  blinks  innocently  at  its  readers  often does not evoke, in the imaginations of its audience, any body at all.  If  the  reader  of  an  email  personally  knows  the  individual  who  includes  an LOL in their message, then perhaps he imagines the face of the sender  breaking out into laughter. But in the case of a fan author grinning at her  fellow fans, I imagine a blank face, something like a mask. And even in the  case of reading LOLs in messages from people whose faces I know well, I do  not imagine their default bodies laughing; I imagine that it is their online  persona who laughs, some face that exists only as a representation of their  mental state, or their moods, that is showing itself to me.  Or, a composed body may reference something that has actually taken  place  in  the  default  body,  but  in  online  communication,  it  is  what  hap- pens to the composed body that holds significance for its interlocutors. For  example, in her interview, fan author Jacqueline  2012  recalls when she  wrote a fanfic for an online friend who asked Jacqueline to “stop bothering  me with all of this Stargate stuff, because I’m into House.”  Stargate refers to  a science fiction franchise about time-and-space travel that includes three  films, three live-action television series, and one animated television series;  House is a US television medical drama.  In response to this request, Jac- queline says, “I paid her back. I wrote a House Stargate crossover with porn    The Default Body and the Composed Body   239  in it and turned her bright red, which I can tell over the Internet”  2012 .  Jacqueline here indicates that she did not see her friend’s facial or bodily  reactions, but that she “can tell over the Internet,” despite the absence of  visual data, that Jacqueline’s erotic fiction turned her friend “bright red.”  I  suspect  that  even  though  this  blushing  may  have  actually  taken  place  in  Jacqueline’s  friend’s  physical  body,  what  matters  to  Jacqueline  is  that  it definitely took place in her composed body. In other words, the friend  likely gave some information to Jacqueline, through text or emoticons, that  expressed a degree of embarrassment that Jacqueline interpreted as blush- ing, and this “facial” reaction is what so pleased Jacqueline.  Coleman declares that, given the proliferation of “new practices around  media  engagement,”  we  must  begin  “trying  to  fathom  what  it  means  to  come face-to-face by way of mediation”  Coleman 2011, 28 . Jacqueline’s  interaction with her friend is, to me, an instance of mediated face-to-face  communication. Jacqueline and her friend are “face to face,” but in a media  space, not in a physical space. Jacqueline “can tell over the Internet” that  her friend has turned “bright red” after reading a pornographic fanfic that  Jacqueline wrote for her, because the friend’s composed body makes this  reddening clear. And it was not important to Jacqueline whether or not the  physical body blushed; she did not need to see a photo of the friend’s face.  Jacqueline triumphed because she made her friend’s composed body, the  body she knows and comes into contact with, blush.  Then, there are many composed bodies that have little or nothing to do  with posters’ “real,” physical, default bodies at all. The fantastical creatures  of  MMORPGs   massively  multiplayer  online  role-playing  games   such  as  World of Warcraft come to mind. Any photos or icons of purely imaginary  beings, symbols, or animals used as online avatars are immediately under- stood by those who view them as being nonidentical to the users’ actual  embodied forms and appearances. And into this category of nonidentical  avatars I place Internet fans’ appropriations of bodies that are well-known  to  them  through  mass  media  texts.  I  do  not  think  that  JET,  or  any  fan  author, means for the fan reader to conflate the bodies of Gillian Anderson  or  David  Duchovny,  the  actors  who  portrayed  Scully  and  Mulder  in  the  X-Files television series and films, with their own default bodies, even when  they write from Scully’s and or Mulder’s point of view. Fans’ appropriations  of performers’ bodies as composed bodies are not executed for the purpose  of self-presentation, but for another purpose. I call it marionetting.   240   Chapter 6  Marionette versus Avatar  In break 0, I discussed a number of early new media theorists who framed  global  communications  networks  and  computer  use  as  “global  theater,”  including  Marshall  McLuhan,  Brenda  Laurel,  Allucquére  Rosanne  Stone,  and Sherry Turkle. I also cited two theorists of fan practices, Kurt Lancaster  and Francesca Coppa, who propose that writing fan fiction is akin more to  producing performances than to producing literary texts. Coppa uses the  phrase “writing bodies in space” to describe what fans are undertaking when  they create fan fiction stories, which is the “appropriation and use of exist- ing characters.” Coppa defines fan fiction “as a textual attempt to make cer- tain characters ‘perform’ according to different behavioral strips”  Coppa  2006b, 230 , citing Richard Schechner’s argument that “living behavior[s]”  are “strips of behavior” that, like film strips, “can be rearranged or recon- structed; they are independent of the casual systems  personal, social politi- cal, technological  that brought them into existence. They have a life of  their own” [Schechner 2013, 34] . Coppa takes up Schechner’s notion that  embodied behaviors have a “life of their own” and applies it to fictional  characters: “Perhaps the characters who populate fan fiction are themselves  the behavioral strips, able to walk out of one story and into another, act- ing independently of the works of art that brought them into existence.  … Characters are able to ‘walk’ not only from one artwork into another,  but from one genre into another; fan fiction articulates that characters are  neither constructed nor owned, but have, to use Schechner’s phrase, a life  of their own”  Coppa 2006b, 230 .  McLuhan’s theory of the global theater invites us to conceive of online  content as performance. McLuhan and Nevitt  1972  postulate that elec- tronic  networks  constitute  a  world-spanning  site  in  which  a  “perpetual  happening” takes place, in which all users can take advantage of the affor- dances  of  network  technology  to  be  “actors.”  Some  of  the  performances  by  users actors  are  presentations  of  self,  in  a  Goffmanian  sense.  Self-pre- sentations online consist of users creating virtual selves to represent them,  which can take the form of an avatar, or what I call a composed body, in  textual, visual, or audiovisual form; in some cases, as I mentioned above,  users’ performances of self through their composed bodies need not bear  any resemblance to their default bodies or real-world personas.  But a different type of online performance is the performance of others,  the presentation of composed bodies that represent not users’ “selves,” but  characters. Fans and other remix artists appropriate the appearances, voices,  manners of speech, gestures, ways of walking and moving through space,    The Default Body and the Composed Body   241  and ways of making contact with other bodies, from characters whose per- formances they see in films, television programs, music videos, animated  films and anime, and other audiovisual media. Schechner states that “strips  of  behavior”  can  be  extracted  from  their  sources  and  “rearranged  and  reconstructed” like film strips, and fans do exactly this: they treat media  recordings as archives of bodies moving, and then “copy” those bodies and  extend their movements into spaces of their own design, following scripts  of their own devising.  Schechner anticipated Internet fan culture and remix culture when he  compared restored behavior in performance to film strips, for fan and remix  practices highlight human performance as the most crucial and usable parts  of film and other recorded media. Whether in fan fiction and fan videos,  or in image macros, GIFs, or memes such as rickrolling7 in which Internet  users deploy images or clips of actors, singers, and other performers  in or  out of character  to make a joke, express a feeling, or advocate for a social  or political cause, human performance is the important element in film, TV,  and video that gets ported into digital networks.  In the mixed reality of online communication, fans create a “mix” of  extracted  behaviors  with  original  scenarios,  turning  the  actual  bodies  of  performers into composed bodies that act out the stories fans direct them  to, similar to the manner in which children use virtual action figures, dolls,  or puppets to “enact”  through the children’s manipulations  a wide scope  of adventures. One reason that I now call fans’ processes of extraction and  transformation archontic production  instead of archontic literature, a term I  used earlier  is because the content that fans produce for the Internet is as  much theater as it is literature, and fan authors are producers and directors  as much as they are writers. Marionetting is another term that can point to  the  ways  that  performers’  bodies  are  virtualized  and  translated  into  net- works; appropriated, replicated, and altered by multiple users in the net- work;  and  then  made  to  play  out  a  range  of  narratives  for  other  users’  entertainment. While online users can perform themselves through digital  avatars, they can also make characters perform through digital marionettes. My basis for the term “marionetting” is theater director E. Gordon Craig’s  idea  of  the  “über-marionette,”  which  he  proposed  in  a  1907  essay.  New  media performance artist Christopher Maraffi states that Craig, influenced  by  the  stylized  movements  of  his  contemporaries,  such  as  actor  Henry  Irving  and  dancer  Isadora  Duncan,  argued  that  for  acting  to  move  com- pletely to a language of symbolic gesture, “all live actors should be replaced  by autonomous puppets”  Maraffi 2011, 1 . In “The Actor and The Über- Marionette,”  Craig   [1907]  2002   writes,  “The  actor  must  go,  and  in  his    242   Chapter 6  place comes the inanimate figure—the Über-marionette we may call him,  until he has won for himself a better name”  159 . Craig’s objection to live  actors was their unreliability: live actors are inconsistent from performance  to performance, and therefore subject the audience to “emotional confes- sions  of  weakness”—uncertainty,  forgetfulness,  and  other  human  foibles  that manifest as missteps in theatrical performances—“which are nightly  witnessed  by  the  people”   161 .  In  contrast,  the  puppet,  wholly  control- lable  by  the  puppet  master  and  therefore  capable  of  delivering  identical  performances night after night, may “become the faithful medium for the  beautiful thoughts of the artist”; that is, the puppet can be entirely devoted  to  the  controller’s  artistic  vision,  and  can  execute  that  vision  perfectly,  while  a  live  actor  can  never  be  perfect  in  their  execution.  Craig  foresaw  the emergence of something more than a puppet, some performing agent  that would be realized through a new technology that he could not pre- dict: “No longer content with a puppet, we must create an über-marionette.   The über-marionette will not compete with life—rather will it go beyond  it”  161 .  Paul  M.  Malone’s  historical  research  reveals  that  Craig  borrowed  the  term “über-marionette” from Heinrich von Kleist and Friedrich Nietzsche,  both of whom saw the marionette as “the symbol of an epiphany both aes- thetic and spiritual,” an entity capable of enacting “the perfect relationship  between  director  and  actor—or  rather,  artist  and  implement  performing  subject and performing object”  Malone 2000, 58 . The composed bodies  that fans use in X-reality achieve the relationship of which Craig dreamed,  the  unity  of  artist  and  implement.  The  bodies  visible  in  the  mass  media  archive, over which fans have little to no control, are transformed by fans  into bodies that they can script and direct as they choose. Fans’ appropria- tion of bodies from the archive of mass culture is often born of frustration  with the quality of the media industries’ products, or rather frustration at  the often-unrealized potential  whether for character plot complexity, emo- tional depth, or explicit sexuality  that fans perceive in these products, and  this frustration is akin to Craig’s ire with the unreliable, imperfect actor, the  live actor who can never deliver exactly what the director wants. The digital  marionette can do what the live actor cannot: enact precisely the scenario  that the fan creator desires. Through the marionette, the audience member  seizes power over the media properties that the media industries sell to her,  and customizes the mass-manufactured product into an “implement” that  she, as artist, can use to make entertainment for herself and others—forms  of entertainment she longs for, but never receives from official media.   The Default Body and the Composed Body   243  The Workings of Digital Marionettes  Marionetting depends on its audiences being well situated in, and already  oriented to, the source texts that get “reconstructed” into new intertexts— already familiar with the source bodies that get translated into new com- posed bodies, in the network. This is what Coppa means when she states  that  “we  know  who  these  [mass  media]  characters  are  because  we  know  the actors who play them, and we bring our memories of their physical- ity  to  the  text,  so  the  reader  is  precharged”  to  encounter  the  characters  again  in  fan  fiction   Coppa  2006b,  235–236 .  In  JET’s  “Night  Giving  Off  Flames,” as in all fan fiction stories, it is necessary for the reader to have  prior knowledge of the performances of Anderson-as-Scully and Duchovny- as-Mulder, individually and together. Without knowing how the characters  interrelate, verbally and physically—what conversations they have repeat- edly, what conflicts continually arise between them, how they stand and  walk together, how they address one another—it is impossible to decipher  “Night,” to understand how it works.  To grasp “Night,” one must first know that a core feature of The X-Files,  reenacted over and over in the majority of the series’ episodes, is the divide  between Scully and Mulder along the lines of doubt and belief: Scully is a  medical doctor, a forensic specialist, and a skeptic about anything outside  the bounds of science; Mulder is a psychologist, a researcher of paranor- mal and occult phenomena, and someone who takes seriously reports of  alien abduction. Most episodes contain at least one scene in which Scully  balks at the notion that the underlying cause for a mystery she and Mul- der are attempting to solve has anything to do with supernatural or alien  phenomena, and at least one scene in which Mulder fervently tries to con- vince Scully to believe that beneath the mystery-of-the-week are real aliens,  ghosts,  magic,  vampires,  golems,  or  some  other  strange  being  or  force.  “Belief” is one term that comes up again and again in Mulder and Scully’s  debates; Mulder has a poster of a UFO behind his desk with the phrase “I  Want to Believe” printed in bold white letters on it, and Scully doggedly  refuses  to  believe  in  extraterrestrial  life.  But,  while  the  partners  disagree  about  whether  or  not  to  “believe,”  they  agree  on  another  term:  “trust.”  Trust also comes up repeatedly in Mulder and Scully’s talks, as they uncover  the  invasion  conspiracy  piece  by  piece  and  reiterate  to  one  another  that  they  can  “trust  no  one,”  and  that  the  only  person  each  can  trust  is  the  other.  JET’s “Night” is thus a fan fiction story about the core axes on which  Mulder and Scully’s partnership and relationship turns: they are opposites    244   Chapter 6  in matters of “belief”  Mulder believes and Scully does not , and united in  matters  of  “trust”   they  trust  only  each  other .  JET  takes  these  two  prin- ciples and plays them out to an extreme: What if Scully were definitively  stripped of her trust in Mulder? What if her innate skepticism were greatly  amplified  by  a  terror-inducing  period  of  captivity,  and  her  disbelief  cou- pled with radical distrust of her partner? In all of Scully’s declarations of  refusing to believe that Mulder is who he says he is in “Night,” we hear  the  echo  of  Scully  saying,  “That’s  impossible,”  or  “There’s  no  science  to  back that up” to Mulder in the episodes of the series. And in all of Scully’s  avowals  in  “Night”  that  she  cannot  trust  Mulder,  not  for  a  moment,  we  can “see,” in our mind’s eye, Mulder’s pain at losing the one person whom  he trusted.  Our ability to envision Scully and Mulder’s suffering as they experience  a  seemingly  unbridgeable  rift  also  depends  on  our  having  already  seen,  on  the  television  series  and  in  the  X-Files  feature  films,  Scully  and  Mul- der’s  occasional  forced  separations,  reunions,  and  reaffirmations  of  their  bond. One of the series’ recurring plot devices is that Mulder and Scully  are often “taken” from one another. Scully and Mulder are each abducted,  presumably by aliens and or their human conspirators, over the course of  the series, and the psychological and physical well-being of each is often  endangered. Images of the protagonists running frantically when they have  been separated, searching for one another in the corridors of an alien space- ship, the backyard of an abandoned tract house, the hallways of a hospital’s  cancer unit, and a vast cornfield in Iowa fill the screens and memories of  X-Files viewers. “You’re the only one I trust,” and “You are my touchstone”  are phrases the partners tell one another earnestly, in soft voices, their gazes  locked  onto  one  another’s,  each  time  that  they  reconnect  after  rescuing  one another from some harrowing predicament. Scully and Mulder rarely  touch, but they do when one is physically injured or otherwise in distress,  usually just a brief clasping of hands or a touch on the shoulder. Typically,  they sit vigil at each other’s bedside when one is in the hospital. All of these  physicalized gestures of urgency, desperation, anxiety, and need when they  are apart, and of closeness, friendship, and emotional intimacy when they  are reunited, are recorded in viewers’ memories. JET calls up these visual  and emotional tropes in “Night,” distilling the entire relationship of Mul- der and Scully down to their greatest fear, and the apparent realization of  that fear: their seemingly irrevocable loss of one another.   The Default Body and the Composed Body   245  He slips into her bedroom and tiptoes to her bedside. He brushes the inside of her  wrist with his fingers, feels the sweet-slow hot pulse there. He touches her only once,  and only for a second.  He tries not to think that he may lose her yet again, and permanently. His eyes  are dry and stinging. He is awake until dawn, her heat echoing across the nerves in  his palms as though he’s been scalded.  JET 2000   These short paragraphs are poignant for the fan reader, as they invoke many  scenes that have played out in the series. These paragraphs’ effectiveness  depend on the reader previously having seen similar sequences of abduc- tion,  rescue,  trauma,  and  the  threat  of  separation  and  death  played  out  multiple times in the source text. And yet the scenario of threatened divi- sion between the partners that JET delivers is far more dire than anything  the television show or films depict—after all, The X-Files is fundamentally  an action adventure mystery series, not a series about aliens colonizing the  Earth, imprisoning and torturing law enforcement officers, and those indi- viduals  subsequently  plummeting  into  post-traumatic  stress  disorder.  An  alien invasion facilitated by human conspirators is the presumptive future  that Mulder and Scully work frantically to forestall, but the premise of the  series is that the heroes can and will succeed in exposing the conspiracy  and preventing this future from coming to pass. By resetting the show in  a fundamentally darker universe, JET is able to stage already familiar char- acters in a scenario in which they must play out what they most dread: an  alternate reality in which their quest to stop the conspiracy has failed, the  world is colonized by a hostile extraterrestrial force, Scully has been hor- ribly  victimized,  and  the  bone-deep  connection  of  Scully  and  Mulder  is  broken.  At the end of the story, however, JET inserts a happy ending, when Scul- ly’s realizes that “it,” whom she believes is a clone keeping her captive, is  actually Mulder, who has rescued her from captivity. When Scully returns  to the cabin and Mulder avers, “It’s me, Scully,” Scully responds, “Mulder,  it’s  me.  It’s  me,  too.”  Here,  JET  invokes  one  of  the  most  often-repeated,  and most mundane, exchanges of dialogue between the partners from the  series: anytime Mulder or Scully call one another on their mobile phones,  they  announce  their  identity  without  stating  their  names,  Scully  usually  saying “Mulder, it’s me,” and Mulder saying, “It’s me, Scully.” JET knows  that these simple lines, heard so often in the source text, will resonate for  her readers when the readers come to them at the end of “Night Giving  Off Flames.” The “It’s me” that both characters speak at the end of “Night”  serve not as simple perfunctory telephone greetings but as a spoken solu- tion to the mystery of the entire fan fiction story, which is: Will Scully ever    246   Chapter 6  believe, and trust, that “it” is Mulder? “It’s me” has tethered them, simply  and effectively, when they have been physically remote from each other in  the “past,” and at the end of the events of “Night,” “It’s me” binds them  together again, after a time when they have been close in physical proxim- ity, yet distant and divided from one another emotionally.  Thus, the fan author translates or ports the embodied speech and actions  of the characters of an audiovisual source text into virtualized, composed  bodies  that  she  can  control  and  maneuver.  The  performances  of  Ander- son  and  Duchovny  as  Scully  and  Mulder,  their  voices  and  gestures,  how  they stand and sit in physical proximity to one another, how they look at  one another, their repeated—Schechner would say “restored”—behavior in  recurring  situations,  for  example,  situations  of  abduction separation  and  reunion rescue, are all crucial to the fan author’s writing of the story, and  to the fan reader’s ability to make sense of the story. The fan author delib- erately echoes dialogue and actions from the source text so that the reader  can understand the particular torque she is putting on the familiar charac- ters and the universe in which they dwell. Without any prior knowledge  of the physicality and aurality of Mulder and Scully, as well as of the com- mon themes and narrative arcs of the series, a reader of “Night Giving Off  Flames” could not grasp that the story actualizes two of the most terrifying  potential futures hinted at in the series—devastating global colonization by  aliens, and a rupturing of the Scully and Mulder partnership—to their logi- cal but harrowing ends.  Is the story compromised by the sudden reunion  of the partners, which seems to pander to most fans’ refusal to tolerate any  permanent rift between the heroes? In my opinion, JET’s transformation  of the usually quotidian “It’s me” lines into magical, healing speech saves  the ending from being maudlin or incredulous, but other fan readers may  disagree.   Fan fiction is therefore a body medium and a form of marionetting, in  that  fan  authors,  in  textual  fictions,  translate  recorded  performances  by  live bodies into composed bodies represented by text, and stage new per- formances by those bodies. The network is the site of these virtual enact- ments; it is the performance space, a “global theater,” in which shows are  put on and received by any user who wishes to participate in the “perpetual  happening.”  Archival Bodies  Fan fiction, like theatrical restagings, incorporates translations and echoes  of  the  physicality  and  aurality  of  previous  performers.  The  gestures,    The Default Body and the Composed Body   247  blocking,  and  manner  of  verbal  delivery  used  in  early  stage  productions  of any given play inform later productions of that play; these become the  conventional ways of staging the play, and even if later productions defy the  conventions established by the initial productions, they still must contend  with them. Similarly, the bodies and voices of actors who appear in mass  media texts are the models for the composed bodies placed by fan authors  in the global theater. This influence on, modeling of, and remembering of,  bodies by bodies is what Diana Taylor calls repertoire.  Taylor does not strictly oppose repertoire to archive. “The archive and the  repertoire exist in a constant of interaction,” Taylor writes. “They usually  work in tandem, and they work alongside other systems of transmission— the digital and the visual, to name two”  2003, 21 . One example that Tay- lor  gives  of  archive  and  repertoire  interacting  is  based  on  media  scholar  Jesús Martín-Barbero’s research on Latin American soap opera fan cultures:  Taylor writes that Barbero “illustrates the uses that viewers make of mass  media,  say,  the  soap  opera.  It’s  not  simply  that  the  media  impose  struc- tures  of  desire  and  appropriate  behavior.  How  populations  develop  ways  of viewing, living with, and retelling or recycling the materials allows for  a broad range of responses. Mediations, he argues, not the media, provide  the key to understanding social behaviors. Those responses and behaviors,  in  turn,  are  taken  up  and  appropriated  by  the  mass  media  in  a  dialogic,  rather than one-way, manner”  Taylor 2003, 21 . Barbero’s essay, published  in English in 1995  in Robert C. Allen’s influential edited essay collection  To Be Continued …: Soap Operas around the World  makes arguments about  media fans being active participants in their receptions of mass texts, argu- ments that resonate with those made by Stuart Hall, John Fiske, Dick Heb- dige, and other prominent US and UK media and cultural studies scholars  at that time. What Taylor adds to the “active audience” line of thinking is  her focus on embodiment. Taylor claims that embodied behaviors  reper- toire  and mass media  archive  engage in mutual appropriations, relating  “in a dialogic, rather than one-way, manner.” Taylor draws on Barbero to  advance the idea that repertoires emerge from audiences’ consumptions of  “archival”—that is, recorded—media, such as film and television.  Applying Taylor’s insights to fan fiction culture, I would say that fans  plunder  archival  media  for  bodies  they  can  use.  Fans  appropriate  the  repertoires  of  bodily  performances  that  they  see  on  screens,  and  reenact  those repertoires in different spaces. One perceives, in fans’ stories of the  myriad ways that they have converted mass media archive into repertoires  both  embodied  and  textual,  a  fluidity  of  travel  between  the  real  world  and X-reality. This fluidity indicates that repertoire lends itself readily to    248   Chapter 6  transmediation. Repertoire migrates freely from medium to medium, from  physical space to media space and back again. Fans copy performers’ bodies  over and over again, using clothes and makeup and voices as well as text  and icons and videos. Repertoire is manifested through both default bodies  and composed bodies.  Writing is certainly a major component of fan fiction creation, but when  we seek to understand how a piece of fanfic works and how it should be  judged in terms of success or failure, virtuosity or banality, we would do bet- ter to look to performance cultures rather than literary cultures for models.  One question that a fan reader might ask in evaluating a fan fiction story,  for example, is, Did the new incarnations of the familiar characters seem  both true to their sources, and yet revelatory, showing some dimensions of  the characters that we never before suspected but that felt utterly believable  when  we  witnessed  those  previously  unseen  aspects  displayed?  This  is  a  question that theatergoers would ask of a contemporary production of any  classic play, any widely known cultural source material. Does the new Cly- temnestra, Lady Macbeth, Hedda Gabler, Song Liling, or Walter Younger— the one who appears before me now, at this moment, in this version—seem  recognizable as the one I know from the written texts of Aeschylus  1984 ,  Shakespeare  1997 , Ibsen  2013 , Hwang  1993 , or Hansberry  1994 , and  or from prior productions of the source material, and yet also seem very  different? Does the new version take the character, and perhaps the entire  production, in an unexpected direction, unearthing buried facets that may  have lain dormant in the source, or adding surprising twists that make of  the originary piece something entirely fresh? In other words, does the new  version  make  good  use  of  the  archive  of  source  text  elements,  and  does  it also make an interesting, unique, or otherwise valuable contribution to  that archive?  Global Media, Local Uses  Composed bodies based on fictional characters are not the only bodies that  perform fan repertoires. Fans also perform their constructed selves in the  global theater. We can elaborate on Taylor’s argument that fans build rep- ertoire from their receptions of archival media, and propose that founding  and  participating  in  fan  communities  are  among  the  forms  of  repertoire  that emerge from active audiences’ interactions with mass media texts. Tay- lor writes that the media event of Princess Diana’s funeral in 1997 sparked  a  number  of  appropriations  by  Latin  Americans,  South  Americans,  and  people of color in the United States, including murals that depicted Diana    The Default Body and the Composed Body   249  as a “saint, victim, and media object”; Taylor  2003  asks, “How did these  global  images  get  downloaded  onto  these  neighborhood  walls?”   135 .  Taylor expresses surprise at how quickly, and how widely, the “download- ing” of images of the much-photographed and much-televised UK princess  occurred after her death; Taylor is especially struck by how many minorities  in the United States and people in the Global South identified with, and  mourned, Diana. But the “downloading” of useful iconography from the  archive of images and sounds constituted by mass media is the exemplary  operation  of  repertoire  on  the  Internet.  In  other  words,  it  is  appropriate  that Taylor uses a networking metaphor  “downloading”  in her discussion  of Diana’s fans’ appropriating Diana’s image and porting it from their tele- vision  screens  into  their  own  wall  murals,  for  this  creation  of  repertoire  from archive is precisely what Internet fans do when they appropriate the  images and voices of any performer who appears in a media text and trans- mediate it into fan fiction, video, or art.  Acts of “downloading” popular media culture can be seen as instances  of repertoire partly because they are made for specific local audiences. These  downloadings  are  responses  to  global  media  by  members  of  the  global  media audience for one another. Although the Diana wall mural artists may  have enjoyed the opportunity to have their art “taken up and appropriated  by the mass media in a dialogic manner”  Taylor 2003, 21 , their murals  were repertoire rather than archive  or rather, were archive-based repertoire   because  they  were  communications  by  fans  to  fellow  fans,  by  mourners  to fellow mourners. These murals were not broadcasts, but “narrowcasts,”  community-casts.  And  the  majority  of  people  who  saw  the  murals  and  understood them, their meanings, and crucially, their affective power—that  is, the people who were affected by the murals as the artists intended—were  the people who had been affected by Diana’s death in the same or similar  ways as the artists. Taylor offers a powerful analysis of how the repertoire  of mural making, and other mourning rituals, in the wake of Diana’s death  was, in some ways, mandated by the ubiquity of global media, and in other  ways, manifested the capacity of active audiences to make their own mean- ings from media events:  Because we are all caught in transnational economic and iconographic systems, we  have no choice, it seems, but to participate in the circulation of capital, symbolic as  well as economic. How we download these images and engage with them, however,  reflects the power of the local community in framing the terms of the debates. … If  we must engage, as it seems we must, these muralists show that people will establish  the terms of the conversation. Rather than constitute one more space for a down- loading of the global, it opens one more strategic site for the negotiation of the local.   2003, 157–158    250   Chapter 6  Taylor’s  claims  here  strongly  resonate  with  McLuhan’s  understanding  of  global telecommunications: we are all now encompassed in a single theater,  meaning that we cannot escape the media networks that span the world.  However, unlike in a broadcast model, no group of users is permanently rel- egated to the position of receiver; any user can put out their own signals for  other users to receive. Taylor suggests that the global theater can be made  to function like a community theater. Fan “downloadings,” appropriations  and transmediations of performers and performances found in mass media  are practices by which media users make global archives into “local,” that  is, community-specific, repertoires.  The Event-ness of Fan Fiction  At the beginning of this chapter, I related that I was surprised when I realized  that JET had written the fanfic story “Night Giving Off Flames” in response  to  a  Scullyfic  Improv  challenge  in  2000.  As  soon  as  I  read  the  paratexts  that  indicated  the  story’s  emergence  from  a  structured  challenge,  I  hap- hazardly opened a number of other fanfics stored in my personal archives,  and noticed that many stories had comparable paratexts, marking them as  having resulted from specific structured interactions between authors and  readers. For example, a Firefly fic in my collection, “Not One to Settle” by  Jedi  Buttercup   2006 ,  begins  with  an  author  note:  “This  was  written  for  spacesantafic a couple of weeks ago; when I found this community today,  I knew I had to post it here as well.” “spacesantafic,” or “SpaceSanta,” was  the name of a LiveJournal community active in the mid-2000s that orga- nized a Firefly-themed holiday fanfic exchange, in which fan authors were  secretly assigned to one another  as in a Secret Santa gift exchange  and  each wrote stories about Firefly characters to please their designated recipi- ents. I found “Not One” on a different LJ community dedicated to Firefly  fic, when Jedi Buttercup cross-posted it there, and had never before noticed  that it had been written for SpaceSanta. Another story, a Battlestar Galactica  fanfic, “The Way It Should Be” by embolalia  2014 , contains the follow- ing author’s notes: “Written for workerbee73 for the song prompt ‘Box Full  of Letters’ and the lyrics I wish I had a lotta answers ’Cause that’s the way it  should  be All  these  questions Being  directed  at  me  …  Also  for  the  comment  that you don’t mind AUs [alternative universe stories].” So, this story, like  “Not One,” was a fanfic created as a gift for a particular reader. Yet another  story  in  my  personal  archives,  a  2005  X-Men  fanfic  by  brynnmck  called  “Brightly Shone the Moon,” is a birthday wish: “Happiest of birthdays to  the sweet, adorable bandgeek. […] Also, since you requested ‘holiday-ish    The Default Body and the Composed Body   251  Logan Rogue’ for Christmas, I thought it would work out well to have it  done by today … I know it’s uncool to do the combo birthday Christmas  present, so just consider this a Christmas present that happened to arrive on  your birthday.” Here was another fanfic-as-gift.  I also noticed stories in my archives that had been written for the Porn  Battle, an annual fan fiction challenge founded by oxoniensis in 2006 in  which fans post prompts  content that they wish to see in a fanfic , and  authors write stories that “fill” those prompts  incorporating the requested  content elements , within a specified time frame—a somewhat similar for- mat to that of the Scullyfic Improv challenge. For example, a 2013 Dark  Knight Rises fanfic in my collection, “Identity” by purple_cube, includes an  author’s note that reads, “Written for Porn Battle XIV, for the prompt ‘start  over.’” I also found stories written for prompts but in a less structured way,  such as one of the Doctor Who fics that I saved, “Incense and Peppermints”  by Skylar  2007 . “Incense” tells the tale of what happened when the time- traveling Tenth Doctor  or “Ten”  and his companion Martha Jones were  trapped for several months in 1969, an event that was alluded to on Doctor  Who  but  never  shown.  The  author’s  note  at  the  top  of  “Incense”  states,  “I so love Ten Martha 1969 stories but there aren’t many of them, and at  smith_n_jones [a LiveJournal community for fans of Ten and Martha] some- one suggested there should be a ‘what happens in 69 stays in 69’ prompt.  So this is an answer to that ghost prompt.” In this case, there was no time- sensitive “challenge” or “battle” to motivate the author, nor did a friend- ship with the prompt-giver inspire Skylar to write the fic, as was the case  for other authors who wrote fics as gifts. Skylar states that she has written  in response to “someone” posting that there “should” be this prompt, and  so she is filling this hypothetical prompt, which she calls a “ghost prompt.” Another prompt-driven format I found among my archived fanfics was  the “comment ficathon,” such as “At the Close,” a Harry Potter Comment  Ficathon  organized  by  anythingbutgrey  to  coincide  with  the  July  2011  release  of  the  seventh  and  final  Harry  Potter  film.  The  directions  are  as  follows:  How do I prompt? Prompts should contain the following format: Characters Ship   optional —Timeline   optional —Prompt   which  may  be  a  song  lyric, quote, etc., but is not optional. … How do I respond? There are no restrictions in terms of word count, format, tense, point of view, etc.  Please title all of your response fics as such in the comment title box: Title—Character Ship—Timeline. …   252   Chapter 6  You can fill prompts that have already been filled. If something speaks to you, as  it were, it doesn’t matter if there’s already fic for it. You can write your own.  any- thingbutgrey 2011   “At the Close” consists of over 2,500 comments; some of these are prompts,  others  are  fanfics  written  in  response  to  those  prompts,  and  others  are  reviews  of  those  fanfics.  Although  there  was  no  closing  date  announced  for the ficathon, “At the Close” appears to have taken place over the course  of  three  and  a  half  months,  from  July  16,  2011,  when  anythingbutgrey  launched it, through October 29, 2011, when the 2,572nd comment was  posted.  I  certainly  recognized  that  “At  the  Close”  was  a  comment  ficathon  when  I  first  came  across  it  in  2011,  but  what  I  did  not  realize  until  this  recent scan of my archives was that “At the Close” was typical of the fics  that I had collected. Rather than being the exception in my archives—the  one ficathon that I had saved in its entirety—“At the Close” was simply  one  of  many  writing  events  that  I  had  stored  over  the  past  fifteen  years.  In  reviewing  my  favorite  stories,  the  abundance  of  references  to  specific  readers and specific prompts, to rule-based and time-limited challenges— to writing within given parameters for particular audiences—that I found  foregrounded for me how fan writing takes place so often in the context  of an event. Of course one might say that the production of any piece of  fictional  writing  is  an  event,  in  the  life  of  its  author  if  for  no  one  else;  but digging into my own archives taught me that, in many or even most  cases, the production of a piece of fan fiction is definitively an event in the  lives of more than just its author. Online fan fiction is frequently produced  in and as a specific moment, for a designated readership that is, in some  form  or  other,  asking  for  that  production  to  occur.  A  fan  author  writes  because  and  when  a  friend,  a  challenge,  or  a  prompt  compels,  requires,  inspires, or requests her to write. A fan writes for an audience—of at least  one   the  person  who  requests  a  birthday  fic,  whom  the  fan  author  pre- sumably knows; or the person who posts a prompt, whom the fan author  may or may not know . I want to emphasize that the demands placed by  a fan community on a fan author are not necessarily personal or explicit  in  nature,  they  can  be  implicitly  made.  For  example,  a  discussion  about  an  aspect  of  a  relationship,  the  importance  of  a  supporting  character,  or  a narrative trope might take place in a mailing list, a Previously.tv forum,  or a Tumblr tag, and fan fiction will begin to appear in those communi- ties  or  related  archives  that  takes  up  those  issues  and  renders  them  into    The Default Body and the Composed Body   253  story  form.  The  inception  of  the  Doctor  Who  fic  created  on  the  basis  of  a “ghost prompt” is an example of a fic being asked for and delivered in  the absence of any preexisting relationship between the prompt giver and  the prompt filler.  Thus, the repertoire of fans comprises at least two kinds of performances:  those performed by composed bodies based on appropriated media char- acters,  of  new  narratives  created  by  fans;  and  those  performed  by  com- posed bodies that represent actual fans, which are the rituals and routines  by  which  fan  readers  demand  that  fiction  be  written,  and  by  which  fan  authors fulfill those demands. Both performances take place whenever fan  fiction is produced, and it is the combination of these performances that  constitutes the event-ness of fanfic. Events such as going to the theater and  attending festivals, or spectating at sports events, are similar: they consist  of the central attraction being played or executed and the attendant per- formances of spectators fans buying tickets, entering the arena or festival  area or playhouse, reading programs or schedules, applauding and cheering  for the “main” performers, and discussing and reviewing the proceedings  when they are completed. The performances of the main players and of the  audience members are both necessary—the interaction of the main players  and the audience is especially crucial—to make the event happen. In an  event, players and audiences each have their repertoire  the portion of the  proceedings that they regularly enact , and the rapport between them  the  alchemy that takes place when performers and audiences connect  is what  gives life to an event and makes it special to all who take part in it. Fan  fiction is produced under much the same conditions as sports events and  festivals, with fan authors and readers enacting repertoires akin to those of  players and spectators. It is because fan fiction emerges from the exchange  of ideas, desires, and energies between the two groups that it feels signifi- cant and relevant to fans  and let us keep in mind that many readers are  writers;  fans  switch  positions  in  the  producer–consumer,  actor–audience  relationship constantly—this is the defining feature of McLuhan’s concept  of global theater .  My  thinking  on  fan-production-as-event  builds  on  the  philosophical  distinction  between  “events”  and  “objects” “things”   see  D.  Hugh  Mel- lor [1980], “On Things and Causes in Spacetime” , but it is important to  note  how  the  field  of  performance  studies  has  complicated  this  distinc- tion. Richard Schechner, for example, acknowledges that media artifacts,  such as films, are “things,” but he argues that each separate act of media    254   Chapter 6  reception  is  a  unique  “event”:  “It  may  be  that  a  film  or  a  digitized  per- formance art piece will be the same at each showing. But the context of  every reception makes each instance different. Even though every ‘thing’  is exactly the same, each event in which the ‘thing’ participates is differ- ent. The uniqueness of an event does not depend on its materiality solely  but also on its interactivity—and the interactivity is always in flux. If this  is so with regard to film and digitized media, how much more so for live  performance, where both production and reception vary from instance to  instance.  Or  in  daily  life,  where  context  cannot  be  perfectly  controlled”   Schechner  2013,  30 .  I  appreciate  Schechner’s  opening  the  possibil- ity of thinking of media reception as event, which draws the entirety of  fandom—which  consists  largely  of  intensive  and  attentive  media  recep- tion—within the bounds of performance studies. But in arguing that fan  productions  are  events,  I  am  less  interested  in  Schechner’s  claims  about  media reception than what he is saying about live performance and daily  life  as  events:  fan  fiction  is  produced  from  interactivity,  and  new  stories  emerge  from  new  interactions  all  the  time;  each  new  story  then  gives  onto more interactivity between fan authors and fan readers. Fan fiction  is thus an event not only because fans consume media and moments of  media consumption are events, but because fans produce in moments of  direct  interaction  with  other  fans.  Although  a  fan  fiction  story  has  the  appearance of a textual “thing,” its ontology is closer to that of a live per- formance or an occurrence in daily life as far as how much “flux,” “inter- activity,” and “variation from instance to instance” informs and shapes it.  Clearly, as the creation of fan fiction occurs in X-reality and not in physi- cal reality, fanfic-as-event is not a live performance, as might take place in  a physical theater, or an occurrence in face-to-face life; however, as I have  argued, new forms of copresence and “face-to-face-ness” have emerged in  the  mixed  reality  of  the  Internet,  and  so  Schechner’s  characterization  of  how events transpire in live environments can, I think, be transposed into  the environments of digital networks.  A fan fiction story cannot be viewed as a wholly self-contained object,  a text delimited by the first and last words that appear on the screen, the  way that readers of novels and other genres of print culture convention- ally  read  books  as  bounded  by  their  covers.  In  fact,  as  the  survey  of  my  archives showed me, the headers of a fan story often announce that story to   be inextricably linked to people other than the author, to fan sites other  than the web page on which the story is published, and to ideas or com- ponents  that  originated  outside  of  the  story  itself.  When  print  was  the    The Default Body and the Composed Body   255  dominant  technology  for  textual  publication  and  distribution,  critical  theorists labored to argue that texts are not crafted in isolation, and that  authorial intent does not circumscribe a text’s possible significations; recep- tion theory, theories of intertextuality, poststructuralist theories, and new  historicism all are attempts to unseat the individual author as the sole ori- gin and locus of a printed text’s meaning. But Internet culture is not print  culture,  and  online  fans  have  always  understood  that  there  is  no  “sole”  author of a fan work, no exclusive origin of the meaning of a fan fiction  story. By the customs of online fan fiction culture, fan authors often make  clear in their paratextual notes that their stories arise from interdependen- cies and flows of information between fan authors and readers. Even when  fan authors do not declare their stories to be entrants into some specific  writing challenge, the context and subtext of their fictions are most legible  to the fan communities in which they participate at the moment in which  they write and post the stories.  This does not mean that fan stories are altogether indecipherable to peo- ple who discover and read them in archives, long after they are written, nor  does it foreclose the possibility of fan authors writing for inactive fandoms,  or writing exclusively for their own enjoyment  rather than for an audience  of fellow fans, with whom they have regular contact in online communi- ties . But to most fans, reading a fan fiction story at the moment when it is  created and shared, and participating in the fan community that gave rise  to that story when that emergence occurred, feels different than reading it  afterward, because an event is experienced differently by those who learn  about it after its occurrence, who read its documentation or view its record- ing or handle the artifacts generated through it, than by those who “were  there when it happened.”  Fans Thinking and Making Events  Using different frameworks, fan scholars before me have argued that Inter- net fan culture generates events rather than objects. Karen Hellekson writes  of the “gift culture” of Internet fandom, referring to online fans’ persistent  practice of creating fanworks for one another, such as the “birthday holi- day gift” fic mentioned above.8 Hellekson states that “the items exchanged  have no value outside their fannish context,” and that fan works-as-gifts  “have value within the fannish economy in that they are designed to cre- ate and cement a social structure, but they themselves are not meaningful  outside their context”  Hellekson 2009, 115 . I read this to mean that fan    256   Chapter 6  “gifts” derive their meaning from the circumstances of their exchange: any  significance that fan works have for their givers and receivers is tied to the  time of gifting, or more precisely, to the themes and memes circulating in  the fandom at the time a gift is made and to which the gift relates; such a  gift is also a part of the bond between the giver and receiver  where a social  bond between them already exists or arises from the gift exchange . Even  when a friendship does not precede the gift giving, a fan author’s giving of  a piece of fan fiction to a challenge or battle strengthens the fan author’s  bond to that community, and also reinforces that community’s cohesive- ness. So, fan works do not signify, and do not hold value, outside of, or  apart  from,  their  event-ness,  their  arising  from  a  specific  set  of  relations   between one fan and another fan, or between one fan and a fan commu- nity  at a specific moment in time.  Rebecca Tushnet also alludes to the event-ness of fan fiction when she  advocates,  from  a  critical  legal  studies  perspective,  for  an  understand- ing  of  fan  and  other  transformative  works  as  multiauthored  rather  than  single-authored.  As  I  mentioned  in  break  4,  Tushnet  draws  an  analogy  between  “multi-contributor  productions”  and  the  fable  of  “stone  soup,”  the  soup  that  results  from  many  villagers  donating  their  meat,  vegeta- bles,  and  spices  to  the  person  who  claims  that  he  only  needs  stones  to  make  delicious-tasting  soup   Tushnet  2013,  1019 .  Through  her  use  of  this fable, Tushnet articulates that fan creation is a matter of collaborative  process, of communal preparation, of many contributors coming together   and  throwing  elements  into  a  pot,  so  to  speak.  The  case  of  the  Scullyfic  Improv  challenge  that  produced  “Night  Giving  Off  Flames,”  in  which  half a dozen fans gave JET a set of diverse required elements to be woven  into  her  story,  immediately  comes  to  mind  as  an  example  of  how  mul- tiple  fans’  ideas  get  incorporated  into  what  appear  to  be  single-authored  works. And in calling fan fiction stories “events” rather than “objects,” I  am attempting to argue that all fan fiction, not only the percentage of sto- ries written explicitly for challenges or lists of prompts, emerges from con- tributions by multiple fans.  Many of our oral history interviewees discussed their writing and read- ing of fan fiction using vocabulary that emphasized fanfic’s event-ness. For  example,  multiple  authors  made  the  point  that  they  were  motivated  to  write, and influenced in their writing, by their connections to fan readers,  and to the collaboratively constructed “traditions” of the fandoms in which  they write. Jacqueline  2012  remembers that she wrote some fan fiction  before she started participating in online fandom, and that   The Default Body and the Composed Body   257  the stuff I wrote before I was fannishly interacting was non-identical to the stuff I  wrote after I was fannishly interacting. When you’re [writing] non-fannish interact- ing stuff, you’re just writing it because you think, “Oh my God, this character is so  hot. I must have more of that.” You’re writing for yourself. Period. You’re not writ- ing for anybody else’s reaction. When you’re in fandom, and then writing among  fans  and  with  the  expectation  that  your  work  is  going  to  be  seen  by  other  fans,  you’re at least partly writing to achieve a response from them. And you’re writing in  context of the tradition. […] You’re writing at other people to an extent, and you’re  writing imagining their reaction. And that does, to a certain extent, change what  you’re going to write.  Jacqueline 2012   Jacqueline went on to name some tropes in the Stargate: Atlantis  SGA  fan- dom about which she wrote fanfic, tropes that were the subjects of “wank”   heated  debates,  or  “flame  wars”   in  the  SGA  fan  communities,  which  would not be decipherable to people who did not participate in, or later  learned about, these intense discussions. Jacqueline wrote about topics that  rose to prominence in her fandom’s debates, topics that she knew would  be relevant to her readers, as they were raised by the readers. In one sense,  Jacqueline  wrote  her  fan  fiction  stories,  but  in  another  sense,  the  entire  fandom generated the subject matter of Jacqueline’s fic. I read Jacqueline’s  statements as revealing the collective authorship and time-specificity of fan  fiction:  the  fan  author  writes  differently  for  herself  alone  than  for  a  fan  readership, and when she writes for a fan readership, she is really writing  with them and for them, writing about issues and themes that they have,  by  consensus  or  dissensus,  declared  to  be  important,  and  writing  about  those themes at the time when they are focal points of the fandom. This  is the “fannish context” that Hellekson writes of, and the stone-soup-like  multiauthorship that Tushnet discusses. Each fan fiction story arises at a  certain moment in a fandom’s history, out of the “tradition” built by the  discussions and disputes of fans, crafted by its author for an audience that  is known to that author. This audience is, in some sense, waiting to receive  the fiction and is able, by virtue of being well-versed in the group’s shared  tradition, to decipher the meanings of the stories. Jacqueline’s stories in the  SGA fandom arose from, and responded to, events in that community’s his- tory, and thus were themselves events in that history.  Fan writing challenges are events in the literal sense, as they have begin- ning dates and  in most cases  end dates, and parameters, rules, and guide- lines that all participants must follow. Many oral history participants spoke  of how important challenges have been in motivating their own writing.  Several  of  the  interviewees  are  organizers  of  fan  writing  challenges,  and    258   Chapter 6  derived the names of their challenges from live events that usually tran- spire in physical space. jinjurly, founder of the Audiofic Archive, states in  her interview that she created “Amplificathon,” an annual challenge that  “is all about getting fandoms and podficcers into the archive who aren’t  already there”  jinjurly 2012 . The challenge’s name is thus a clever play on  “amplification,” meaning an increase in volume  meaning sonic loudness ,  as jinjurly is attempting to amplify, or increase the volume  meaning size   of, the Audiofic Archive, a site hosting an oral aural format of fan fiction.  jinjurly  says  that  she  created  Amplificathon  “both  as  a  festival,  which  is  entirely to feed the archive, … and as a community”  jinjurly 2012 .  Amplificathon  is  only  one  of  many  fan  fiction  challenges  with  “ficathon”  in  the  title,  a  term  that  seems  clearly  related  to  “marathon”  races  and  endurance-based  contests  such  as  “dance-a-thons.”  oxoniensis   2012  says that she got the idea for naming the Porn Battle “from dance  battles, where dancers take it in turns to dance as hard and brilliantly as  they can. Dance battles are just so full of life, and such fun, and although  they’re called battles, there’s generally no such thing as losers. […] More  than anything they’re just about going for it, giving your all. So I thought  the fannish equivalent could be a porn battle, where writers all get their  chance to write as hard and brilliantly as they can!” eruthros and thing- swithwings founded the kink_bingo challenge with the goal of making it  game-like:  eruthros:  So I think we were spitballing all of these random—like, “We could do a  challenge that was like”—and then we would name a game. “It’s like Monopoly!” But  how could you do a challenge that’s like Monopoly? [Laughs]  thingswithwings:  Monopoly always ends in tears, as well.  eruthros:  Right.  thingswithwings:  So you want something that ends in “Hurrah!” like Bingo.  eruthros and thingswithwings 2012   Festivals, marathons dance-a-thons, dance battles, and parlor games— these are the activities from which fans borrowed the names, and, in the  case of kink_bingo, the structure, for their fan fiction challenges. With fan  writing  challenges,  as  with  fan  fiction,  we  find  default  bodies  modeling  action for composed bodies. The attitudes, the atmospheres, the levels of  excitement  and  energy  with  which  fan  organizers  hope  to  imbue  their  events, they appropriate from real-world events, translating these attitudes  and atmospheres for the mixed reality of the Internet, motivating real bod- ies  to  get  to  work  making  new  productions  of  composed  bodies  for  the    The Default Body and the Composed Body   259  global theater. By delimiting special times and sites for fan production, by  marking out a kind of Bakhtinian  [1965] 1984  “carnival time” from the  “perpetual happening” of the Internet, fan challenge organizers are able to  incentivize fans to take their turns on the global theater stage.  My Gutenberg Mistake  And now, I will briefly to return to the mystery with which I opened this  chapter: How is it that I overlooked the paratexts in JET’s “Night Giving Off  Flames,” as well as in a good number of stories in my personal fan fiction  archives, that indicated that these stories were written in response to chal- lenges, as gifts, for prompts, and so on? In other words, how could I have  ignored, for many years, the fact that these stories were not free-standing  stories but were events in the lives of their fandoms, and entries into those  fandoms’ histories?  I think the answer is that I acquired literacy in the last period of print  culture’s dominance. Having been born very near to the close of what Tom  Pettitt  2007  and L. O. Sauerberg  2009  call the “Gutenberg Parenthesis,”  and having opted to complete a BA in modern thought and literature, an  MA in humanities, and a PhD in comparative literary studies, I was thor- oughly trained to read print. Any digital literacy skills that I possess today,  I  acquired  on  my  own  rather  through  any  institutional  education,  as  is  the case with  I think  most of the humanities scholars of my generation.  And while I have flattered myself in the past as to my degree of new media  literacy, this exercise of rummaging through my own archives and being  surprised by them has held up a mirror to my self-image as a digital literate  and shattered my self-perception.  The reason that I never before noticed that “Night Giving Off Flames”  was an improv challenge fic, or that any of the rest of my collection of fanfic  were stories written for various other writing challenges and exchanges, is  simple: I was reading fan fiction as print culture in electronic form, rather  than as digital culture. Even though I was aware that fan fiction concerns  borrowed  characters  rather  than  wholly  original  ones,  I  still  applied  the  same frameworks, the same modalities of reception, the same criteria for  evaluation, to digital fiction as I did to print fiction. As Pettitt says, “The  difference  between  the  world  within  the  Gutenberg  Parenthesis  [i.e.,  the  world of print culture’s dominance] and the world without  be it before or  after  is in the first instance the significance accorded to the composition  of a given work as opposed to its performance, and in the second instance    260   Chapter 6  Pre-Parenthetical  Gutenberg Parenthesis  Post-Parenthesis  re-creative collective con-textual  unstable traditional  Performance  original individual  autonomous  stable  canonical  Composition  sampling remixing borrowing reshaping  appropriating  recontextualizing  Figure 6.1 Pettitt’s  diagram  of  the  history  of  human  culture,  from  the  “Pre-Parenthetical”    i.e., culture before the rise of printing , to the “Gutenberg Parenthesis”  when print  is the cultural dominant , to the “Post-Parenthetical”  the time after print’s domi- nance .  Pettitt  equates  “post-parenthetic”  culture  with  “digital  internet  culture”   2007, 2 .  the  degree  to  which  either  process  involves  the  introduction  of  material  from other works performances”  Pettitt 2007, 5 . So, those locked into the  Gutenberg Parenthesis look for compositions by single authors and judge  them on their originality and uniqueness, and those who lived before the  print era and who now, after the print era or at the cusp of that era’s end- ing, are acquiring as many or more digital literacies as print literacies, and  look for performances of works that “introduce material from other works  performances.”  Inside  the  Gutenberg  Parenthesis,  states  Pettitt,  are  crite- ria for valuation such as “original,” “individual, “autonomous,” “stable,”  “canonical,” “composition.” Outside the parenthesis: “re-creative,” “collec- tive,”  “con-textual,”  “unstable,”  “traditional,”  “sampling,”  “remixing,”  “borrowing,”  “reshaping,”  “appropriating,”  “recontextualizing,”  “perfor- mance”  2   see figure 6.1 .  Let us take note of Pettitt’s deliberate typography here: “composition”  and “performance” are clearly marked as the master terms of print-analog  culture and digital culture, respectively, by their bold letters.  When first encountering fan fiction, collecting it, and rereading it over  the years, I perhaps understood the “sampling,” “remixing,” “borrowing,”  and  “appropriating”  aspects  of  digital  culture,  but  I  did  not  thoroughly  grasp it as “collective,” “con-textual,” “unstable,” “performance.” I still, for  the most part, saw “composition” when I read online fanfic. And because my  print-based literacy was much more developed than my digital literacy, or  what Gregory Ulmer  2005  calls “electracy,” I was blind to the many para- texts in my fanfic collection which announced that a new form of reading,    The Default Body and the Composed Body   261  of  receiving,  culture  had  begun  in  my  lifetime.  I  was  using  an  old  lens,  composition, to view this new phenomenon launching on digital networks:  performance.  My attempt to expand and strengthen my own media literacy skills, by  seeing, interpreting, and analyzing the objects of my study for what they  were—as events, as performance—constitutes the chapter that you have just  finished reading.    Break 6  Body and Voice in Fan Production Break  Body   Voice   and   in   Fan   6 Production  There are many ways that media fans translate mediated bodies into writ- ten  texts,  or  reenact  them  through  their  own  bodies,  or  imagine  bodies  for  nonembodied  characters.  This  break  will  explore  a  few  of  the  varied  ways that fans connect embodiment, media, and textuality through their  archontic productions.  Real-World Performances  So far, I have focused on how fans perform the repertoires of favorite char- acters in written stories. But fans also perform these repertoires in real-world  spaces: when they dress in costumes and role-play as their favorite char- acters at conventions, LARP  live-action role playing  events, or other fan  gatherings; when young fans “play pretend” together, each player assum- ing the identity of a different media character, such as Iron Man or Wonder  Woman; or when they play with action figures or dolls representing media  characters and enact new challenges and adventures with the figurines.  In  interviews  with  fans,  my  research  team  heard  many  instances  of  fans combining embodied play with the writing of fan fiction, especially  in their childhood and adolescent years. For example, Henry Jenkins and  his friends, at eleven years old or so, regularly spent their free time after- school in Henry’s backyard, pretending to be movie monsters in full char- acter  makeup  that  they  learned  to  apply  from  reading  the  fan  magazine  Famous Monsters of Filmland; Henry wrote scripts for the monster movies  that he was convinced the group would one day make together based on  their enactments of Dracula and Frankenstein  Jenkins and Jenkins 2012 .  Cynthia Jenkins recalls that as an adolescent, she and a friend would have  sleepovers during which they would collaboratively make up stories about  Neil Armstrong, Captain America, Alexander the Great, and other fictional  and nonfictional personages who interested them at the time; after their    264   Break 6  storytelling sessions, Cynthia would document their stories in written out- lines   Jenkins  and  Jenkins  2012 .  When  Francesca  Coppa  was  twelve  or  thirteen years old, she met a girl who was writing what she called a Star  Wars  “soap  opera,”  which  she  was  staging  using  Star  Wars  figurines  in  a  dollhouse; Coppa and a few other tweens joined in and both playacted and  scripted the ongoing Star Wars narrative, using a different color of marker  to write the lines for each character and then regular pen to denote stage  directions. When Tari  2012  was thirteen, one girl in her circle discovered  fanfic based on Anne Rice’s Vampire Chronicles online, and started printing  out her favorite stories and reading them aloud to friends, which was how  Tari  discovered  fanfic:  “I  would  just  really  listen  to  [my  friends]  reading  fanfic that they found on the Internet, but I didn’t actually look for fan  fiction myself”  Tari 2012 . All of these fans experienced fan fiction in their  youth as both written and performed; in Tari’s case, fan fiction was initially  an exclusively oral literature.  Other interviewees talked about performing as media characters in the  real world. Many mentioned cosplay, or costume-play, which is usually lim- ited to fan conventions, but one fan, Louisa Stein  2012 , talked about a  way that fans can also imitate characters’ physical appearances subtly, on a  daily basis. Stein participated in a Roswell fan website called Roswell Beauty  Divas, on which fans shared where the clothes and makeup products fea- tured on the show could be acquired, so that fans could incorporate ele- ments of the characters’ styles into their everyday wardrobes and “looks.”  “If  you  love  a  character  that  has  particular  qualities  and  these  qualities  are expressed through their styling, how do you channel that styling? …  And it’s a sort of personalization, but not through fan fiction, not through  discussion, [but] through performing it in your everyday life,” says Stein   2012 . She recalls that one of the major projects of the fans on the site was  to share advice on how to replicate characters’ style affordably, for example  by hand-sewing certain clothing items and accessories, or buying approxi- mations of them at Walmart. “And then there was a real sort of joy and  celebration in that, and in the characters through their aesthetics.” Stein  worked as a temp at Citibank during Roswell’s run, and recalls that “it was  a corporate context, … and at first I was dressing very conservatively, …  but also browsing [the Divas site], and by the end of it, I was like, inflecting  all my corporate outfits with Maria-inspired clothing”  Stein 2012   Maria  DeLuca was one of Roswell’s main female characters . Although Stein does  not frame this stylistic “inflection” explicitly as a resistance to the corpo- rate dress code of her workplace, it is amusing to think of a minor form of  Roswell cosplay being performed regularly in that environment.   Body and Voice in Fan Production   265  Audiofic Performances  Another  form  of  embodiment  that  fans  give  to  textual  fan  practice  is  “audiofic,”  or  “podfic.”  Audiofics  are  audio  recordings  of  fans  reading   aloud  works  of  fan  fiction;  they  are  analogous  to  audiobooks,  which  are  audio  recordings  of  performers  reading  aloud  published  fiction  or  non- fiction  books.  As  with  audiobooks,  the  majority  of  audiofics  are  read  or  recorded not by their authors, but by fan readers. In her oral history inter- view, jinjurly  2012 , who founded and maintains the Audiofic Archive, the  largest online archive of podfic, describes podfic as a physicalization of fan  fiction, which she acknowledges some fans find distasteful or off-putting.  When a fan becomes a “podficcer,” or someone who records a podfic, says  jinjurly,  You are basically sharing a part of your body with people in a way that, yeah, some- times people find really creepy. Usually, one of the objections that authors some- times have, and fans in general sometimes have, to podfic, that they have a really  hard time putting into words, [is] basically ... that sort of, ‘I think it’s creepy.” Yeah,  okay, that’s valid. If you find it creepy, that’s fine. It is a very physical thing that  someone is doing that has this physical result with your story that you wrote, and  it does change it. … Odds are …, it’s not going to be what the author heard in their  head, and it also demonstrates very very strongly that we all have different interpre- tations.  jinjurly 2012   Though jinjurly is here addressing what she perceives to be a widespread  objection to podfic, there were many fans of podfic among our interview- ees, such as Rebecca Tushnet  2012 , who says that “a lot of my comfort  consumption is podfic, which I really like,” in large part for “the emotional  tone of someone’s voice,” and Kristina Busse  2012 , who says that “podfic  does  a  lot  for  me.  …  That’s  actually  become  kind  of  my  comfort  thing,  more than story reading these days, because I just, you know, I lie in bed,  and close my eyes, and just have someone read me a story.” However, the  idea of podfic being “creepy” to some fans, perhaps particularly fan authors  whose works are transformed by being read aloud, interests me because fan  fiction incites the same kneejerk response in many authors and producers,  as well as fans, of source texts. Bestselling science fiction and fantasy novel- ists George R. R. Martin, Anne Rice, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Diana Gabaldon  have all been vocal in their opposition to fan fiction, Le Guin stating that  fanfic is “not sharing but an invasion, literally—strangers coming in and  taking over the country I live in, my heartland,” and Martin saying, “My  characters are my children … I don’t want people making off with them,  thank you”  Goofusgallant 2012 . While some authors have difficulty with    266   Break 6  fanfic because of potential copyright infringement, Le Guin’s and Martin’s  comments speak more to an instinctual conviction that some authors have  that only they can compose the bodies of their characters  Martin’s “chil- dren” , and only they can dwell in the mixed realities they create  Le Guin’s  “heartland” . I think that these authors’ deeply felt resistance to fan fiction  is echoed in fan authors’ finding podfic “creepy.” Beyond any arguments  that I, or any of fan fiction’s proponents, may make about culture being  inherently shareable and prone to interpretation, adaptation, and remix,  there  is  a  deep  irony  in  fans’  disliking  a  transformative  use  of  fan-made  transformative works.  jinjurly defends podfic by comparing it to stage performance. In chapter  6, I argued that fan fiction is a translation of default bodies into composed  bodies, and jinjurly’s perspective leads me to think of podfic as a transla- tion of composed bodies back into default bodies—the default bodies of fan  readers. States jinjurly:  Podfic is a transformative work in its relationship to the original source. Is podfic a  transformation from a transformative work in relationship to the story? No. It could  be. … What it is is generally derivative, but that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t have  a lot of creativity behind it. Its relationship to the actual fic, yeah, is derivative, but  there’s a lot of difference between reading Hamlet as a text or watching Ethan Hawke  play  Hamlet  or  watching  Kenneth  Branagh  play  Hamlet  or  watching,  I  imagine,  Sarah Bernhardt play Hamlet. … These are all very different characters, but they’re  all the same character. They’re all delivering the same lines, more or less … but there  are different parts of this story being told in different ways. Stage plays, I think are  probably the best illustration of this as an analogy.  jinjurly 2012   jinjurly points to a vast difference in perceptions of iteration and variation  in  theater  culture—where  repertoire  is  the  dominant  logic—versus  print  culture—where archive is the dominant logic. In stage performance, varia- tion  and  “versioning”  are  the  norm,  whereas  print  culture  treats  text  as  fixed and inviolable. I think that fan fiction, and especially podfic, uncov- ers  the  fact  that  print  is  not  as  fixed  as  is  conventionally  thought:  even  print  texts  are  made  meaningful  by  being  received  by  readers  and  “per- formed” in their imaginations. It is because the “voices” of characters or  narrators  in  transformational  works—literally  voices  reading  aloud,  in  the  case  of  podfic—do  not  match  the  voices  in  the  minds  of  the  source  text authors  in the case of podfic, the “source author” is a fan author  or  source  text  fans  that  sparks  their  immediate,  gut-level  rejection  of  those  transformations.  But  the  culture  of  fan  fiction  and  fan  works,  including  audiofic,  calls  for  a  widespread  acceptance  that  each  reader’s,  each  cul- tural receiver’s, body is different, and so cultural works are brought to life    Body and Voice in Fan Production   267  differently  by  and  in  each  body.  This  is  true  even  in  the  case  of  fan  fic- tion based on audiovisual media—that is, even when it seems that every  fan  has  in  mind  the  same  composed  bodies   what  characters  sound  and  look like, as performed by particular actors , there is still some difference  in how each fan author, and fan reader, animates these bodies mentally.  And  once  a  reader viewer listener  takes  possession  of  a  composed  body  through the act of media consumption, she will operate, script, and direct  that body as she chooses. No source author or fan author can control or  prevent this maneuver, this “invasion”  as Le Guin says  or appropriation  of composed bodies by audiences, for it is a fundamental operation of cul- tural dissemination and reception.  Fan Casting  The importance of performers’ bodies to fan authors and readers is made  even more evident by “fan casting,” which is a convention used by some  fan authors of designating a popular actor as the “portrayer” of an origi- nal character  OC  included in a fanfic story  Fanlore, “Fan casting” . An  author might indicate that an OC is “played by” a movie star, or that she  had that star “in mind” when writing the OC. The author, knowing that  fan readers will already have “in mind” the actors who portray the main  characters  in  the  source  text  when  they  read  the  fanfic,  wish  to  provide  as clear an image of the new, unfamiliar OC, and so she places the body  and  voice  of  a  familiar  performer  on  the  same  virtual  stage  as  the  other  already-known bodies and voices. The primary characters who appear in  fics have already been “cast” by the television series or the films in which  they initially appear, so some fan authors feel compelled to “cast” any OCs  they include, to ensure that all of the bodies playing out the fan-authored  scenario  in  X-reality  space  are  equally  vivid  for  the  reader.  Since  images  of famous actors proliferate in the mainstream press and media, depicting  them in a wide variety of poses and costumes  for example, actors may be  photographed for a fashion magazine layout wearing sumptuous Victorian  English period dress or futuristic sci-fi garb , fans can select the photos of  an actor from the wider media archive in which the actor most looks like  the fan author’s OC  for example, if the fan author has written a story that  takes  place  in  Victorian  England  or  in  a  twenty-fifth-century  space  sta- tion , and create photosets or montages of the actor “playing” their origi- nal character.  Recently,  fans  have  also  taken  to  recasting,  especially  through  “rac- eswapping,” “racebending,” or “genderbending,” familiar characters as well    268   Break 6  as original characters. For instance, one fan created a photoset from images  and  GIFs  of  African-British  actor  Idris  Elba  and  African-American  actress  Kerry Washington playing various roles throughout their careers, images in  which both performers look glamorous and dangerous, interspersed with  images of the DC comic book and movie characters Batman and Catwoman   figure 6a.1 . The caption of the photoset reads, “Idris Elba as Bruce Wayne  Batman  and  Kerry  Washington  as  Selina  Kyle Catwoman.”  Batman  has  never been portrayed by a black man on film or television, but the Elba– Washington fan work makes the case, with just a handful of images, that  the fictional billionaire-vigilante could easily be played by Elba, whose con- fidence,  sophistication,  and  widely  respected  acting  talent  would  enable  him to excel in the role. Moreover, Catwoman has been portrayed twice by  black actresses  Eartha Kitt in 1967–68 on the Batman television series, and  Halle Berry in the 2004 feature film Catwoman , so the notion of a black Bat- man is a logical extension of the precedent of Catwoman’s being sometimes  depicted as African American  indeed, some of the Catwoman images in the  photoset are of Halle Berry in costume . Fan casting raceswaps such as this  are fan fictions that do not need to provide much, if any, story or dialogue  to fan readers, because the insertion of black faces, voices, and bodies into  roles that are usually portrayed by white actors is the fanfic. Fans who have  seen stories and scenes featuring Batman and Catwoman play out in films  and  television  series,  and  who  also  are  familiar  with  Elba  and  Washing- ton’s acting styles, can easily envision the performers enacting the famous  DC-universe characters—except that Hollywood has never allowed Batman  to be portrayed by, and as, a black man. What if Hollywood were willing  to give audiences films in which black actors can play lead characters as  heroic  and  as  villainous,  as  romantic  and  strong  and  sexual,  as  complex  and as important, as Batman and Catwoman are in Tim Burton’s and Chris- topher Nolan’s Batman films? The Elba–Washington photoset, and other  fan raceswapping and genderbending castings, conjure up a fictional media  industry for the fan reader, one that is entirely different than the media  industry that audiences are currently “stuck with,” one that is more attuned  to the possibilities of foregrounding minority, female, and queer actors and  characters. What makes possible the fan reader’s understanding of this type  of  fan  fiction  is  the  operation,  common  to  all  transformative  fan  works,  of appropriating embodied performances as the bases of composed bodies  that can exist, and be deployed according to the fan author’s directions, in  virtual space.   Body and Voice in Fan Production   269  Figure 6a.1 Fan casting raceswap: African-British actor Idris Elba and African-American actress  Kerry Washington “cast” as Batman and Catwoman.   270   Break 6  Performances without Moving Pictures  What about fan fiction that is based not on audiovisual recordings of live  bodies but on other formats of source materials? Is fan fiction still a body  medium when it is based on still recordings  photographs  of live bodies;  hand-drawn or digitally rendered bodies such as one finds in graphic nov- els, comic books, manga, cartoons, animated films and videos, anime, and  video games; bodies composed in text, such as one finds in novels and non- fiction books; bodies represented through musical performance and popu- lar song recordings; and bodies that are not humans or humanoid robots,  but are things objects animals  this type of fanfic is called “anthropomor- phic fic” ? I would say that fan fiction stories based on non-film video TV  sources are still stories about bodies. I agree with Kurt Lancaster  2001  that  when we see a person sitting in a chair reading a book, we are watching that  person produce theater in his or her mind, for the solitary reader mentally  animates the beings who initially exist only as words on the book’s pages;  the reader “sees” and “hears” the beings “come to life” in the spaces of his  or  her  imagination.  The  fan  author  succeeds  with  her  readers  when  she  can write characteristics that all fans of a source text will quickly recognize  as proper to the characters in that source text; in other words, as long as  fan readers sense a close relation between the characters that they “know”  and the fan author’s version of those characters, they will be able to “see”  and “hear” the fan author’s enactments, using those appropriated bodies,  “come to life” in the space, the X-reality, of their imaginations. They will  be able to witness the performances that the fan author stages in the global  theater.  One might also say that, when fans take on the task of transforming a  source text that has never been visualized, it is the “voice” of the source  author that the fan author attempts to replicate, rather than any physicality  of the characters. For example, fan author via_ostiense  2012  states in her  oral history interview, “When I write, or when I used to write in Harry Potter  [fandom], I didn’t have any trouble with it at all. But when I think about  trying to write, I don’t know, for Lymond, say [Francis Crawford of Lymond  is the hero of Dorothy Dunnett’s six Lymond Chronicles novels, published  between 1961 and 1975, about sixteenth-century European and Mediter- ranean politics], it’s much harder, just because the quality of Dorothy Dun- nett’s prose is excellent, and—and her writing has such a distinct feel, that  it would—I have a really hard time with the idea of writing something not  in her voice, but at the same time her voice is so damn hard to emulate. So  I end up not writing it for anything at all”  via_ostiense 2012 . via_ostiense    Body and Voice in Fan Production   271  here  distinguishes  between  source  authors  whose  literary  voices  are  easy  to replicate  J. K. Rowling  and those whose voices are difficult to replicate   Dorothy Dunnett .  The  implication  is  that  when  via_ostiense  can  emulate  a  source  text  author’s  voice,  she  can  write  fanfic  about  the  source  text,  and  when  she  cannot emulate that voice, she cannot write fic about the source text, no  matter how much she may wish to. I think that this need to emulate voice  stems  from  the  fan  author  wishing  to  evoke  a  resemblance  for  the  fan  reader: if fan readers do not recognize the characters or voices that the fan  author writes as having any similarity to the characters or voices that they  “know” from the source material, then the performance constituted by the  fan work fails. Or rather, it never transpires; the stage of the fan reader’s  imagination remains empty of bodies and voices.    7  Archontic Production: Free Culture and Free Software as  Versioning Chapter  Archontic   7 Production  New Media and the Archival Turn  So far, I have been discussing digital cultural memory as it is manifested  in the building and maintenance of Internet archives. But digital cultural  memory is composed of two threads, woven around one another like the  double helix of biopolymer strands in a DNA molecule. One thread consists  of actual archives, such as those I described in earlier sections. The other  thread consists of conceptual archives. But what do I mean by “actual” and  “conceptual” archives?  By “actual” archives, I mean archives as built repositories. By “conceptual”  archives, I mean archives as thought constructs. Michel Foucault made this  distinction in his 1969 book Archaeology of Knowledge  published in English  in 1972 , but it achieved widespread visibility in humanities and social sci- ence research beginning in the 1980s with what anthropologist Ann Stoler  named the “archival turn”: “a rethinking of the materiality and imaginary  of collections and what kinds of truth-claims lie in documentation”  Stoler  2002, 94 . The archival turn marked a moment when “archive” changed  definition, when the term began to “represent neither a material site nor a  set of documents,” but served “as a strong metaphor for any corpus of selec- tive forgettings and collections—and as importantly, for the seductions and  longing that such quests, accumulations and passions for the primary, orig- inary and untouched entail”  94 . This “metaphoric move”  94, n. 29 —the  transition of the referent of “archive” from material substrate to the register  of abstraction and symbol—facilitated groundbreaking work such as Allan  Sekula’s “The Body and the Archive”  1986  and Mary Ann Doane’s “The  Instant and the Archive”  2002 . Sekula’s article examines the role that pho- tography played in identifying, and making visible, class differences in the  nineteenth century, helping to establish “a generalized, inclusive archive, a  shadow archive that encompasses an entire social terrain while positioning    274   Chapter 7  individuals within that terrain”  10 . Doane’s essay argues that “What film  archives,  …  is  first  and  foremost,  a  ‘lost’  experience  of  time  as  presence,  time as immersion”  221–222 , a loss keenly felt by those subjected to the  nineteenth- and early twentieth-century industrialization of time, “[time’s]  rationalization  and  abstraction,  its  externalization  and  reification  in  the  form  of  pocket  watches,  standardized  schedules,  the  organization  of  the  work day” through which “time becomes other, alienated”  221 . Sekula’s  and Doane’s influential pieces stand as only two examples of how scholars  have rendered the archive figurative rather than physical. Kate Eichhorn   2008, 8, n. 2  summarizes the archival turn as “the archive’s repositioning  as a subject of investigation rather than [as a] mere site where research takes  place.”  So,  before  the  archival  turn—that  is,  before  Eichhorn,  Stoler,  Doane,  Sekula, and Foucault’s Archaeology—what was the archive? One could say  that it was a place of the dead, the still, the frozen. Foucault  1986 , in his  essay “Of Other Spaces” based on a 1967 lecture, argues that the archive,  museum,  and  library  resemble  the  cemetery.  He  states  that  the  “idea  of  accumulating  everything,  of  establishing  a  sort  of  general  archive”  that  arises in the nineteenth century in the West, with the advent of moder- nity, reveals a “will to enclose in place all times, all epochs, all forms, all  tastes…outside of time and inaccessible to its ravages”  Foucault 1986, 26 .  In “Archive Fever,” Jacques Derrida  1995  gives the origin of “archive” as  “the Greek arkheion: initially a house, a domicile, an address, the residence  of the superior magistrates, the archons, those who commanded. … It is at  their home, in that place which is their house  private house, family house,  or  employee’s  house ,  that  official  documents  are  filed.  The  archons  are  first of all the documents’ guardians. … It is thus, in this domiciliation, in  this house arrest, that archives take place”  9–10 . From both Foucault and  Derrida, we get a sense of the earliest meaning of archive as, first, a “mate- rial site”  in Stoler’s phrasing , a physical place, and second, a site in which  documents remain stationary, as if they are dead and mummified, “outside  of time and inaccessible to its ravages.” An archive is a “house” whose con- tents are under “arrest.”  If that is what an archive was, what is an archive today, after the “archi- val  turn”?  As  stated  above,  “archive”  does  not  now  necessarily  refer  to  a  material site; sometimes it is a metaphor. But, of course, some archives are  still  built  repositories.  Both  of  these  categories—conceptual  archives  and  actual  archives—are  being  radically  redefined  by  digital  technologies.  In  this chapter, I will argue that new media have made possible archives that  are designed to be fluid and constantly altered by crowdsourced updates.    Archontic Production   275  We must conceive of information preservation sites very differently than  the nineteenth century did, and regard them not as prisons for documents  that  optimize  for  stasis  and  timelessness,  but  as  “dynarchives”   a  term  coined  by  Wolfgang  Ernst   that  invite  interaction  and  remain   theoreti- cally  forever in flux.  I will also argue that new media have facilitated the multiplication of  what Eichhorn calls “archival genres,” meaning types of cultural produc- tion that appropriate “images and texts culled from other sources.” Eich- horn compares Internet blogs to Renaissance-era commonplace books; she  argues that both the digital genre  blogs  and the much older handwritten  genre  commonplace books  are “products of collecting and ordering” found  content.  Early  modern  readers  copied  “adages,  sententia,  and  examples”  and other “textual fragments … from a myriad of sources” into their com- monplace books, using the books “as memory aids and as rich storehouses  of materials that might eventually be incorporated into composition[s] of  one’s  own  making”   Eichhorn  2008,  1 .  Similarly,  states  Eichhorn,  most  blogs consist of quotations of, and references to, media authored by others.  Eichhorn argues that there is a “long, albeit largely neglected, history” of  archival genres, a history that has spanned the centuries from the Renais- sance to the dawn of the digital age and includes “everyday textual prac- tices” such as scrapbooking, blogging, and social networking  3 . I consider  fan  fiction,  and  all  fan  works,  to  be  archival  genres  as  Eichhorn  defines  them: texts composed of elements collected from other texts.  In a 2006 essay  Derecho 2006 , I proposed “archontic literature” as a  name  for  the  body  of  derivative  writing  of  which  fan  fiction  is  but  one  subset  this corpus also includes literary “classics” such as Jean Rhys’s Wide  Sargasso Sea, which retells the story of Charlotte Brönte’s Jane Eyre from the  point of view of the Caribbean-born “madwoman in the attic,” and J. M.  Coetzee’s Foe, which narrates the tale of Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe from  a female castaway’s perspective . I posited that archontic literature consists  of fictional writings based on source texts, that is, texts that have been pub- lished; the writers of archontic literature are readers-turned-authors. Each  source  text  is  the  foundation  and  core  of  an  archive  from  which  reader- authors make withdrawals  elements they wish to use  and into which they  make deposits  their stories that incorporate those appropriated elements ,  thereby augmenting and enlarging the overarching archive.  However,  digital  derivations  encompass  much  more  than  text-based  stories,  so  I  now  think  that  archontic  production  is  a  more  useful  head- ing  for  the  enormous,  ever-growing  category  of  appropriative  writings,  soundtracks, still and moving images, audiovisual works, games, and codes    276   Chapter 7  that constitutes a vast swath of digital culture today. My idea of archontic  production  includes  Eichhorn’s  “archival  genres”  of  blogs  and  common- place books, which she defines as “plotless and meandering,” “straddl[ing]  autobiography  and  critical  writing,”  and  “accumulative”   2008,  7 ,  and  goes beyond them to also include transformative texts that are narrative  driven, do not prominently foreground the reader-author’s personality, and  are not structured as compendia.  I argue that archontic production and rogue archives comprise the twin  strands  of  digital  cultural  memory.  Digital  media  accelerates  archontic  production, as it offers numerous affordances for remediation  Bolter and  Grusin  2000 ,  transmediation   Jenkins  2003,  2007b,  2011b ,  and  remix   Lessig 2008 —that is, for the treatment of circulating texts as archives, “as  rich  storehouses  of  materials  that  might  eventually  be  incorporated  into  composition[s]  of  one’s  own  making”   Eichhorn  2008,  1 .  Digital  media,  as I have discussed, also contain multiple affordances for archive building,  and many online archives—the majority of the rogue archives that I have  described—are explicitly dedicated to the preservation of archontic produc- tion, the saving of the manifold variants that proliferate in the wake of the  releases of source texts. Digital cultural memory therefore comprises both  metaphorical and material archival activity.  The growth of digital cultural memory illustrates that the archival turn  has reached far beyond the arenas of the heritage industry, the information  sciences, and humanities research: new media culture writ large participates  in, and elaborates on, the archival turn. But there are even greater rami- fications  of  digital  cultural  memory’s  steady  expansion.  I  will  argue  that  the proliferation of actual archives of archontic production supports and  strengthens a movement that legal scholar Lawrence Lessig calls free culture,  which Lessig links to GNU Project founder Richard Stallman’s free software  movement. Free culture, like free software, is not a political movement per  se, but it is a movement toward certain objectives and away from certain  currently dominant structures. Free culture strives to legitimate and plat- form  cultural  production  “from  below,”  as  Marxist  historians  would  say.  Free  culture  shunts  aside  print-era  conceptions  of  copyright,  authorship,  textuality, and collective memory, and seeks to replace them with copyleft,  a cultural commons that gives onto collaborative creativity, a widespread  acknowledgment  and  acceptance  of  versioning   which  resembles  perfor- mance far more than writing , and rogue archives. Free culture wishes to  usher in a new set of archons, whose subjectivity will dramatically diverge  from that of print era’s writers, readers, and archivists.   Archontic Production   277  Archontic Production  Archontic production, as it pertains to reworkings of popular media, is the  process by which audiences receivers of mass-produced and mass-distrib- uted cultural texts—the commodities sold by what Max Horkheimer and  Theodor Adorno  2002  called the “culture industry”—seize hold of these  commodities as a vast archive of usable resources, from which they select  desirable parts as the raw material for their own revisions and variations.  Archontic production begins when the intended consumers of mass cul- ture  purposefully  misperceive  and  reframe  cultural  commodities.  Rather  than regarding mass media texts as “end products” of the culture industry,  which they are supposed to purchase and with which they are supposed to  be satisfied, archontic producers treat mass media texts as starting points  from  which  to  launch  their  own  narratives,  images   still  and  moving ,  sounds, graphics, and or animations—new, highly individualized texts that  serve their ends and satisfy them far better than mass-produced culture ever  can. The “they” in the previous sentence is the presumptive “audience,” an  undifferentiated body of paying customers, or rather, a body clumsily seg- mented, by the culture industry and its financers advertisers, into brackets  defined by age, ethnicity, nationality, location, and income level. Archontic  producers are in fact users of culture rather than consumers, consisting of,  and creating, individual and unique bodies.  Networked computing does not automatically work well as a memory  machine  in  the  sense  of  preserving  everything  that  people  do  and  share  on the Internet—as I have argued, a great deal of human labor is required  to  make  the  Internet  work  like  an  archive—but  it  excels  at  facilitating  a  kind of culture making that is memory based. Networked computing allows  for multiple transmediations and transformations of cultural texts, and the  constant  circulation,  in  online  spaces,  of  those  reworkings.  Transmedia- tions and transformations are, in part, rememberings of culture-that-came- before; they are premised on a large-scale understanding of both individual  texts  as  archives  and  of  culture-as-archive,  with  online  sharings  of  such  appropriations constituting augmentations of the cultural archive.  But  then,  does  not  the  cultural  archive  become  unwieldy  in  its  gross  enlargement by constant archontic production? In several places in their  book  Audiences,  sociologists  Nicholas  Abercrombie  and  Brian  Longhurst  express some anxiety regarding the sheer quantity of audience-generated  texts  that  now  circulate  on  electronic  media  networks.  They  cite  Barry  Shank’s theory of music “scenes” as a useful analogy for how the contem- porary mediascape operates: Shank defines a “scene” as “an overproductive    278   Chapter 7  signifying community; that is, far more semiotic information is produced  than can be rationally parsed”  1994, 22 . Shank refers to scenes’ “poten- tially  dangerous  overproduction  and  exchange  of  musicalized  signs  of  identity  and  community”   1994,  122 .  In  scenes,  write  Abercrombie  and  Longhurst   1998,  162 ,  “conventional  divisions  between  producers  and  consumers become blurred.” And now, Abercrombie and Longhurst argue,  everywhere  is  a  “scene,”  that  is,  scenes  are  no  longer  limited  to  popular  music cultures or to any specific medium’s cultures. In every medium, and  across media, audiences become fans become producers, and all participants  become players and contributors. Thus, all media scenes are too prone to  “potentially dangerous overproduction” to ever be “rationally parsed.”  Abercrombie and Longhurst interestingly locate a solution to this prob- lem of overproduction in a study of heritage institutions: Gaynor Bagnall’s  1996 essay “Consuming the Past.” Abercrombie and Longhurst cite Bagnall’s  notion that visitors to a museum or heritage institution first map the site  physically, by “mov[ing] around the site in a very direct way”  Abercrombie  and Longhurst 1998, 168  and then map the site emotionally, responding  to different images and exhibits differently  Bagnall 1996, 236–239. . Aber- crombie and Longhurst express a wish that future audience researchers will  aim to elicit and study individuals’ emotional maps of mediascapes in order  to better understand “the relationships of different forms of media to the  everyday  life  of  participants”   170 .  The  implication  is  that  because  “the  mediascape to which [audiences] relate in [their] everyday life … is increas- ingly complex and global”  170 —one reason for this is that audiences now  create and circulate their own texts in addition to the texts made and dis- tributed by “official” cultural producers—individuals must be creating emo- tional maps to help themselves navigate the vast quantity of media that  they encounter. People have to make emotional maps of media in order to  decide, of the overwhelming number of possible media performances pre- sented to them, which ones they will consume and become involved with,  which ones they will become fans of, which ones they will use as the bases  of their own performances.  I find Abercrombie and Longhurst’s turn to memory institutions to be  provocative, because it allows me to understand the entire arena of media  production  and  circulation,  including  literature,  radio,  cinema,  comic  books,  television,  recordings  of  live  events,  the  Internet,  art  institutions  and cultural memory institutions, plus audiences’ responses and creations  in all possible media—the Mediascape in the largest sense—as itself a giant  memory  institution,  which  fans  must  physically  map   deciding  which  websites, TV programs, bands, and films to use and consume , and then    Archontic Production   279  emotionally map  deciding which stories, shows, and songs they will affec- tively invest in and perhaps repeatedly consume . I like the strange image  of concentric rings of archives that this evokes: if all of media is already a  museum, then people make emotional maps of that museum in order to  decide what they are fans of and in order to gather with like-minded others  in organized fandoms; then fans within each fandom use their maps to cre- ate archives of the fan works that matter to them; and then users of those  fan  archives  must  make  emotional  maps  of  what  they  find  inside  those  “museums,” since fan repositories can also be overwhelmingly large  after  all, what Shank and Abercrombie and Longhurst are referring to when they  write about “overproduction” is the potentially limitless number of fan per- formances that can be produced within any given scene .  So,  my  concept  of  fan  production  as  archontic  production,  combined  with Abercrombie and Longhurst’s invocation of heritage institution map- ping, opens up a perception of contemporary media use as a Russian doll set  of archiving-within-archiving-within-archiving. Individuals roam the enor- mous halls of the archive of media texts, they make selections and decide  which  texts  they  will  be  fans  of,  they  make  another  round  of  selections  when they decide what they will use as the sources for their own variants,  they build archives for those fan works, and they browse those archives of  fan works and make selections of those they like best.  Fans can then opt to  create new performances that archontically use other fans’ performances,  such  as  remixes  of  remixes,  which  then  augment  actual  archives  of  fan  works and virtual archives of source texts, and so on, and so on.   Archontic production, then, reveals that digital popular culture is enact- ing its own archival turn, as audiences refuse the notion of “archive” as a  place where documents remain untouched and frozen, under “house arrest,”  and instead realize their power to seize upon all of culture, especially mass  media, as an archive, as an ever-expanding collection of archives that exist  for their use, that contain the raw matter for their generation of new nar- ratives, new connections, new significations. Media audiences have begun  to perceive that they, themselves, are the archons, the ones who make the  laws that govern the textual archives they encounter, take possession of,  explore, and exploit. Audiences grasp the products of mass culture in their  hands, not to put them under arrest and keep them contained, static, and  still, but to subject the products to their manipulations. The law set forth  by the archon-authors who were previously known as “the audience,” if it  were ever to be written down, would state that the archives of mass media  are open, capacious, permitting infinite withdrawals and welcoming of an  infinite array of additional entrants and entries; their potential for growth    280   Chapter 7  is unbounded, they can hold and receive any contents that the archons see  fit to deposit there. As many fans as there will ever be of Jane Austen’s Pride  and Prejudice  [1813] 2012 , that is how large the Pride and Prejudice archive  will become, for the archive will house all of those readers’ interpretations  and new versions, including all films and television miniseries and novels  and Web series, all scholarly essays and commentaries, and all fan works  as  well.1  The  archive  remains  open  to  new  entries,  and  each  new  entry  changes the entirety of the archive.  In “Archive Fever,” Derrida, as is his wont in most of his writings, reveals  a definition of archives that appears to be the very opposite of the defini- tion  he  initially  gives.  While  he  opens  the  essay  with  statements  about  archives as the sites of “house arrest,” he eventually argues that a “new the- ory of the archive” is coming into being, one that marks it as “a movement  of the promise of the future no less than of recording the past,” and as the  bearer of an “unknowable weight,” that is, the weight of the unknowable  future shape, size, and nature of the archive, which comprise the archive’s  “opening on the future,” its “dependency with respect to what will come,”  and “all that ties knowledge and memory to the promise”  1995, 24 . This  archive  that  is  never  closed,  but  is  always  laden  with  promise,  with  the  promise of what will come, and the promise of what it, the archive itself,  will become each time new contents enter it through its opening, through  its always-being-open: this is the archive that the new archons have discov- ered, and of which they make good use.  Free Culture  In the preface to his book Free Culture, legal scholar Lawrence Lessig  2004   writes, “The inspiration for the title and much of the argument of this book  comes from the work of Richard Stallman and the Free Software Founda- tion. … All of the theoretical insights I develop here are insights Stallman  described decades ago. One could thus well argue that this work is ‘merely’  derivative”  xv . But of course, Lessig’s goal in Free Culture, and in much of  his subsequent writing  especially his book Remix [2008] , is to persuade his  readers to begin perceiving derivative works as not “‘merely’ derivative” but  as works that develop a source. In Lessig’s, and Stallman’s, view, derivations  and iterations are not “mere” repetitions  rip-offs, knock-offs, copies, fakes   of original works by lesser authors; they are progressions, elaborations, and  extensions, which are useful  if only to their makers , and are, therefore,  necessary. Such developments of source material are not, in other words,  redundant; they must be done, in order to fulfill the needs of the developers    Archontic Production   281   and possibly additional users , and in order to fulfill the potentiality that  would otherwise lie dormant, unused, in the source.  Both archontic production and rogue archives participate in and exem- plify the free culture movement. What I call “the free culture movement”  is not a highly visible, clearly organized series of direct actions, as were the  civil rights movement or the women’s rights movement of the twentieth  century. Rather, it is a movement composed of everyday cultural practices,  of minor and major appropriations and transmediations performed by indi- viduals and collectives most of whom would not say, if questioned, that  they were primarily or even slightly motivated by an ideological commit- ment to “free culture,” but that they were simply doing what they wished  to do with the new media tools, platforms, and networks available to them. The free culture movement began taking shape in the 1990s, when new  media became integral to the everyday life of millions of consumers, and  when the culture industries began lobbying the US Congress and fighting  numerous court battles to shore up the legal definition of US copyright, as  a defense against digital technologies’ affordances for copying, cutting-and- pasting, and remixing—in other words, as a defense against the threat that  digital technologies pose to the culture industries’ ability to own, control,  and  profit  from  the  global  flows  of  cultural  content.  Supporters  of  “free  culture” believe that copyrights should not, by default, be extended indefi- nitely,  without  limit;  that  definitions  of  “fair  use”  must  be  expanded  to  include the types of transformation and sharing made possible by emerging  technologies; and that cultural works must be allowed to enter the public  domain so that audiences can transmute them without risk of committing  a legal infringement. Free culture holds that culture should be free, as in  freedom  not necessarily free, as in “free beer” [Lessig 2004, 106] . But to  understand free culture, one must have at least a passing familiarity with  free software.  The  free  software  movement  is  a  more  cohesive  and  organized  move- ment than the free culture movement. The free software movement has an  identifiable founder, Richard Stallman, who writes and speaks on its behalf,  it is guided by the nonprofit Free Software Foundation  FSF , and it counts  legions of software engineers as its adherents. The FSF promotes four essen- tial freedoms of computer users:  Freedom 0: The freedom to run a program as you wish. Freedom 1: The freedom to study the source of the program and change it so that it  does the work that you wish  i.e., the freedom to study and change the program’s  source code . Freedom 2: The freedom to distribute exact copies to others.   282   Chapter 7  Freedom 3: The freedom to distribute modified copies to others.  Stallman 2012; see  also Weber 2009, 48   The  FSF  has  created  many  guidelines  and  apparatuses  that  explicitly  invite  users  to  practice  these  four  freedoms,  and  that  protect  what  users  create when they practice them. For example, the FSF created the General  Public  License   GPL ,  which  enforces  a  kind  of  legal  right  that  Stallman  calls “copyleft.” “Copyleft uses copyright law, but flips it over to serve the  opposite of its usual purpose: instead of a means of privatizing software,  it becomes a means of keeping software free. … For an effective copyleft,  modified versions must also be free”  Stallman 2002, 22 . What this means  is that, according to political science scholar Steven Weber, “free software  and derivative works from free software remain free. The central idea of the  GPL is that it uses copyright law to extend the four freedoms by preventing  any users from adding restrictions that could deny these rights to others”   Weber 2009, 48 . So, if an individual  or a firm  releases software that she  wants others to modify, but does not issue that software under the GPL,  then  another  individual   or  firm   can  incorporate  elements  of  that  soft- ware into her own version, and release that modified version as proprietary  software, disallowing any further modifications and reverting to the older  “logic of keeping software source code secret”  Weber 2009, 48 .  So, the FSF insists that the four freedoms be protected for all future users  of all free software—that software must remain free, into perpetuity, rather  than being transformed into copyrighted proprietary code. Again, free soft- ware code, whose programmers place it under copyleft rather than copy- right, can be monetized and sold, but its source code can never be walled  off from future users. “Copyleft says that anyone who redistributes the soft- ware,  with  or  without  changes,  must  pass  along  the  freedom  to  further  copy and change it. Copyleft guarantees that every user has freedom”  Free  Software Foundation n.d. .  This may seem highly abstract to many who do not regularly write soft- ware or think about the writing of software, so an illustration of what free  software produces may be useful here. Figures 7.1 and 7.2 show the history  of the GNU Linux operating system. The figures illustrate that GNU Linux  is a single operating system comprising numerous variants called “distri- butions” or “distros.”  Many people call this set of variants “Linux distri- butions,” but this is a misnomer. GNU is an operating system composed  entirely of free software, whose development was initiated by Stallman and  continued by the GNU Project, and Linux is an operating system initially  developed by Linus Torvalds. What most people today call the “Linux sys- tem” is really the “GNU Linux system,” that is, “GNU with Linux added”    See figure 7.2 for detail  GNU Linux distibution timeline 1992–2013   Major distributions Debian  Slackware  Redhat  Figure 7.1 GNU Linux Distribution Timeline, version 12.10, by A. Lundqvist and D. Rodic, Oc- tober 29, 2012  http:  futurist.se gldt  .   284   Chapter 7  Figure 7.2 Detail of the top section of the GNU Linux Distribution Timeline 12.10  showing  several forks of the Debian branch .  [Stallman 2012], or, the Linux kernel combined with many programs origi- nally written by the GNU Project.  The first releases of GNU Linux came  out in the early 1990s, and since then, over six hundred distros have been  released. Approximately half of these are being actively developed today,  so  there  will  undoubtedly  be  hundreds  of  additional  GNU Linux  distros  released in the next twenty years. Some of the distros were not well main- tained, and so fell out of use, while other distros, such as Debian, proved  so popular that they gave rise to multiple forks  and some of those descen- dent distros, such as Ubuntu from Debian, in turn earned followings that  generated new forks . Not all GNU Linux distributions are completely free   according to the FSF’s definition , but many are.  The images that show the history of GNU Linux distributions serve as  useful  visualizations  of  not  only  free  software,  but  free  culture.  Think  of  the Harry Potter novels, authored by J. K. Rowling and appearing in print  between 1997 and 2007, as composing the “kernel” of what we might call  the “Harry Potter operating system.” Now think of the culture industries and    Archontic Production   285  of ordinary individuals as “users” of the Harry Potter system, who, operating  under the four freedoms  without necessarily understanding that they are  doing so , decide to:     run  that is, read, and comprehend  the  Harry Potter  program as they  wish  Freedom 0 ;    study the source of the program  the story and characters, as laid out in  the books  and change it so that the program does the work that they wish,  by adapting and transforming the books into films, video games, costumes,  fan fiction, fan vids, and so on  Freedom 1 ;    and distribute these modified copies to others, by writing essays about  Harry Potter for school assignments or for academic journals, by dressing up  as Harry Potter characters and attending fan conventions and posting selfies  of their costume play  “cosplay”  on Instagram, by making films based on  Harry Potter and uploading them to YouTube, by posting fanfic stories to fic  communities and archives, etc.  Freedom 3 .  In  this  schema,  every  variant  of  Harry  Potter,  whether  “official”   autho- rized  and or  created  by  Rowling  or  Warner  Bros.,  which  purchased  the  media rights to Rowling’s novels  or “unofficial”  created by readers-fans ,  whether high budget or low budget, whether consumed by millions or by  only a handful of people, is a unique release, a unique distribution, of the  Harry Potter system.  Some  distros  of  Harry  Potter  have  attracted  more  users,  and  generated  more  variants,  than  others:  the  films,  for  example,  generated  many  fan  works based more on their depictions of the  Harry Potter stories than on  the novels  just as some GNU Linux distros, such as Debian, have gener- ated many more new distros than others . But each distro belongs to, and  expands, the system. While neither Rowling nor Warner Bros. assigned a  Creative Commons license or any other license that adheres to the prin- ciples of copyleft, readers and fans still exercise their freedoms in relation  to how they use the system kernel. My view is that the four freedoms are  not only accessible and utile when certain legal designations are in place;  the four freedoms are innate to media reception, consumption, and use, and  legal designations, such as the GPL license or Creative Commons licenses,  simply try to align with, formalize, and provide legal cover for, the free- doms that media users exercise with or without legal permissions  I discuss  this idea at greater length in break 7 .  Figures 7.1 and 7.2 show archontic production in operation. Archontic  production is a crowdsourced multiplication of the contents of an archive.  Archontic production does not treat the objects within an archive as discrete    286   Chapter 7  Figure 7.3 Hand-drawn visualization of fan fiction production based on the film Mad Max: Fury  Road on Archive of Our Own, June 18, 2015.  and separate from one another. Rather, for the archontic producers, all of  the stories that stem from a published storyworld are linked, branching off  one another, just as all of the variants of the GNU Linux operating system  are linked. The GNU Linux operating system constitutes a single metaphor- ical archive  or meta-archive  containing many variants, just as the Harry  Potter metaphorical archive  meta-archive  contains millions of variants.   Figure 7.3 is my crude attempt to draw the archontic production within  a  specific  fandom,  the  Mad  Max  fandom.  Fan  fiction  stories  branch  out  from source media texts in a way that is similar to GNU Linux distros’ fork- ing from earlier versions of the operating system; I call this type of visu- alization  “the  bloom  from  the  kernel”   which  plays  on  the  concept  and  phrasing of the “Linux kernel” . In figure 7.3, the “kernel” is the Mad Max  universe, created by George Miller, consisting of four motion pictures  to    Archontic Production   287  date . I am depicting only the “bloom” of Mad Max fan fiction stories pub- lished and stored on the Archive of Our Own  AO3 , and since AO3 had not  yet launched when the first three Mad Max films were released, my bloom  represents, for the most part, only the types of fanfic generated in response  to Mad Max: Fury Road  MMFR , the fourth film, which premiered on May  14, 2015. A handful of fan stories, about various characters from the first  three films, appeared on the archive prior to MMFR’s opening, but as soon  as the fourth film appeared in cinemas, fans began to produce fic in much  greater volume.  In the bloom generated by fans building on the MMFR, I have drawn  a fork for each of the most popular fanfic genres in the fandom  “popu- lar” meaning the most numerous: fans wrote more of these types of stories  than any others . Each “genre” of MMFR fanfic is organized around specific  characters,  and  usually  also  around  those  characters’  relationship  to  one  another. My bloom thus consists of forks for Furiosa Max  the characters  played by Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy  as a romantic pairing; Capa- ble Nux  the characters played by Riley Keough and Nicholas Hoult  as a  romantic pairing; Furiosa and Max as a nonromantic pairing  these stories  focus  on  the  friendship  or  camaraderie  between  the  two  characters ;  the  group of characters called the Wives  played by Keough, Rosie Huntington- Whiteley, Zoë Kravitz, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton , whom Furiosa and  Max rescue in the film; Immortan Joe  played by Hugh Keays-Byrne , the  movie’s primary villain; Nux paired with other characters; other boyslash  pairings   e.g.,  Max Nux ,  other  femslash  pairings   e.g.,  Furiosa Capable ,  and other heterosexual  e.g., Furiosa and another male character  pairings;  “Threesomes  and  Moresomes”   e.g.,  Furiosa Nux Max  or  Immortan  Joe  The Wives ; and single-character  stories that only delve into the thoughts  and experiences of one character, e.g., Furiosa .  The largest MMFR genres—Furiosa Max, Capable Nux, and the Wives— now have forks for “AU,” or Alternate Universe, versions of those charac- ters and pairings. I have indicated, at the bottom of the graphic, some of  the most popular AU settings in the MMFR fandom: Pacific Rim  the 2013  Guillermo del Toro film in which pairs of characters who are “drift-compat- ible,” i.e., whose minds can “meld” at a deep level, can pilot giant machines  in combat against kaiju, which are giant dinosaur-like monsters—in most  MMFR Pacific Rim crossover AU stories, Furiosa and Max discover they are  drift-compatible  and  become  copilots ;  Coffee  Shop   in  which  several  of  the characters work at a contemporary coffee shop, and get to know the  other characters when they patronize the shop ; University  in which the  characters meet on a college campus ; and Hospital  in which one or more    288   Chapter 7  of the characters works at a hospital, and meet the other characters when  they  need  treatment .  I  have  attempted  to  indicate  the  relative  popular- ity of fic genres by the lengths of their forks, so the longer the fork, the  more stories have been written in that genre, but this drawing is not data  driven. The kernel—the horizontal line representing the official Mad Max  franchise, whose official “author” is auteurist director George Miller—con- tinues  on,  as  Miller  is  about  to  launch  several  Mad  Max  comics  and  will  possibly, depending on MMFR’s box office receipts, make more Mad Max  feature films.  Intertextuality and Feedback in Free Software and Free Culture  Both free software and free culture archives open onto the future, as Der- rida would say. The branching structure of the GNU Linux makes percep- tible the conceptual archive that is opened by every new source text, and  how that archive expands: through the activity of its users, who contrib- ute modifications and variants. Christopher Kelty  2008  writes that Linux  “privileges openness to new directions, at every level. … It privileges the  right  to  fork  the  software  into  new  and  different  kinds  of  systems.  …  It  should  be  remembered  that  Linux  is  by  no  means  an  attempt  to  create  something  radically  new;  it  is  a  rewrite  of  a  Unix  operating  system,  as  [Linus] Torvalds points out, but one that through adaptation can end up  becoming something new”  Kelty 2008, 222 . Both free software and free  culture value forking, rewriting, and adapting over “creat[ing] something  radically new”—but both recognize that there can be originality, novelty,  and innovation in derivation, modification, and modulation.  Literary scholars could argue that free software and free culture, both for- mations of the digital era, have not founded any new thinking but are only  adapting ideas already developed by print-era theorists of intertextuality. In  his 1967 essay “The Death of the Author,” Roland Barthes argues,  We know now that a text is not a line of words releasing a single “theological” mean- ing  the “message” of the Author-God  but a multi-dimensional space in which a  variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash. The text is a tissue of  quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture. … In the multiplicity  of writing, everything is to be disentangled, nothing deciphered; the structure can be  followed, “run”  like the thread of a stocking  at every point and at every level, but  there is nothing beneath: the space of writing is to be ranged over, not pierced. … In  precisely this way literature, … by refusing to assign a “secret,” an ultimate meaning,  to the text, … liberates what may be called an anti-theological activity, an activity    Archontic Production   289  that is truly revolutionary since to refuse to fix meaning is, in the end, to refuse God.   Barthes [1967] 1977, 146–147   Barthes’s  poststructuralist  idea  that  all  language  references  all  other  lan- guage, that there is no originality in literary writing except in the recom- bination of known words, phrases, scenarios, and tropes, leads him to tear  down the idea of an “Author-God,” whose conscious intention or uncon- scious genius “fixes” the meaning of a text with finality. If the meaning of  a text cannot be finally decided, then a text is simply a “space of writing  to be ranged over,” a space whose internal structure is borrowed from all  preceding works of culture, and can be followed, can be traced like a run in  a stocking. Anyone who has worn stockings knows that no “run” is final:  any and every rip in a stocking’s fabric is likely to extend and expand; runs  beget runs. The multidimensional space brought into being by a text con- tains multiplicities, and gives on to further multiplicities. Barthes’s meta- phor of the stocking run evokes, in our digital period, software “runs,” so  we might say that, as a piece of software can be run on multiple machines,  so a piece of culture  a text  can be run on multiple readers, and those read- ers can, in turn, run with the text they receive  or rather, run with the text  as they perceive it  in any direction they choose. We might figure their run- ons as forkings or branchings-out from the text, and envision the multidi- mensional space of Barthes’s text as tree-like in shape, similar to the above  visualizations of GNU Linux.  Rather than viewing transformative works as “‘merely’ derivative,” or as  repetitions, copies, rip-offs, knock-offs, or imitations, the free software free  culture framework allows us to see transformative works as development  projects, as elaborations, extensions, modifications, and refinements of a  source.  We  can  think  of  GNU Linux  distros  as  fan  productions.  We  can  think of Harry Potter fan productions as distros. We can think of software  engineers as “fanficcing” the GNU Linux operating system kernel. We can  think  of  fans  as  “engineering”  new  distributions  of  narrative storyworld  system kernels. We can conceive of the culture industries’ mass media pro- ductions as releases of system kernels, on top of which fans users constantly  build new distributions.  A  major  difference  between  GNU Linux  software  development  and  media fans’ modes of cultural production is that GNU Linux often seeks to  stabilize code through incorporating variants. Free software does not wish  for infinite forks, for, as Kelty writes, forking “implies dilution and confu- sion—competing versions of the same thing and potentially unmanageable  incompatibilities”   2008,  233 .  Free  software  developers  practice  a  range    290   Chapter 7  of methods to achieve some degree of reconciliation and standardization,  that is, to decide what features and “mutations”  Kelty 2008, 156  will be  included in official releases. If fans consider their source texts to be mass  media titles, and their own works to be forkings of the commodities sold  to them by the culture industries, they never expect their variations to be  incorporated into later versions of the mass media texts. When a new sea- son of a serial television program debuts, or when a film franchise such as  Star Trek or Star Wars is relaunched or “rebooted” by Hollywood studios that  own their copyrights, fans do not anticipate that they will be regarded as  contributors to the development of these story worlds, and do not expect  that a vote will be taken among all the users of these worlds as to which fan  versions should be woven into the new canonical “releases.” Fans do not  require or desire their innovations or features to be incorporated into the  source, and they do not view themselves as developers contributing to the  improvement of the source.  However,  GNU Linux  software  development  and  fan  production  pro- ceed  similarly  in  some  respects.  Fans  can  be  said  to  “improve”  a  source  text for themselves and their fellow fans: fan productions come into being  because users of these source materials deem them insufficient and inad- equate, and or in need of augmentation or elaboration. Fans also improve  one  another’s  work,  through  processes  such  as  “beta-ing”   a  beta  reader  reviews  and  edits  a  fan’s  work  before  the  work  is  publicly  posted;  media  fandom  appropriated  the  term  “beta”  from  the  arena  of  software  design  [see  also  chapter  6,  n.  4] .  Fans  occasionally  incorporate  one  another’s  changes into their productions, resulting in the formation of what is called  “fanon,” or fan canon, which is a set of features of the larger story world,  the meta-archive, that become constant in a great deal of fan production  even  though  they  never  appear  in  the  canonical,  or  source,  texts.  Fans’  responses and opinions sometimes inform official makers’ decisions, in the  manner of a feedback loop. But this feedback is not collected or channeled  formally,  according  to  published  procedures,  as  happens  in  free  software  development communities. Thus, remix collectives and free software com- munities  do  not  mirror  one  another  precisely,  but  share  a  family  resem- blance. Both groups define themselves by a strong commitment to what E.  Gabriella Coleman  2012  calls “productive freedom”  3 , which, she states,  encompasses  makers’  rights  to  “autonomously  improve  on  their  peers’  work,  refine  their  technical  [or  creative]  skills,  and  extend  craftlike  engi- neering [or cultural] traditions”  Coleman 2012, 3 .   Archontic Production   291  Archontic Production and New Media Literacies  Stallman  2012  states that none of the four freedoms of free software are  compulsory.  “You  don’t  have  to  do  any  of  these.  You  could  run  the  pro- gram as you don’t wish if you’re a masochist. You don’t have to distribute  copies,  and  you  don’t  have  to  distribute  modified  versions,  you  can  run  it  privately.”  I  view  the  four  freedoms  of  free  software  as  directly  appli- cable to free culture, including their noncompulsory status. The existence  and growth of free culture does not mandate that every cultural consumer  must transform each work that they encounter and post all of their remixes  online; even those who self-identify as fans do not generate modifications  for all of the media they view, hear, read, or play, and some fans who do  produce transformative works rarely or never share them with others. Like  free software, free culture does not insist that every person who has access  to the Internet become a fully and constantly participating member in the  multidirectional flows of media content, but it seeks to defend the ability of  any individual to contribute to those flows through archontic production,  whenever and however they wish.  At  the  same  time,  a  growing  number  of  scholars  in  education  studies  and other fields are defining archontic production as a critical component  of “new media literacies.” Lessig quotes Elizabeth Daley of USC’s Institute  for Multimedia Literacy and the School of Cinematic Arts and Stephanie  Barish,  CEO  of  IndieCade,  who  have  experimented  with  teaching  new  media literacies in inner-city Los Angeles high schools, on the importance  of teaching children the skills to not only comprehend media, but to make  media. Daley states, “From my perspective, probably the most important  digital divide is not access to a box. It’s the ability to be empowered with  the language that the box works in. Otherwise only a very few people can  write with this language, and all the rest of us are reduced to being read- only”   quoted  in  Lessig  2004,  37 .  The  opposite  of  “read-only”  is  “read- write.” As Lessig explains in his book Remix, in a read-only  RO  culture,  the dominant mode of media consumption is to simply read  or listen to,  or view, etc.  works as they are produced and packaged by their makers, but  in a read-write  RW  culture, “reading … is not enough.” Lessig writes, in a  read-write paradigm, “Ordinary citizens … add to the culture they read by  creating and re-creating the culture around them”  Lessig 2008, 28 .2 Lessig  cites John Seely Brown, formerly chief scientist of Xerox Corporation, as  another proponent of read-write culture, though Brown is more concerned  with how young people learn engineering skills than with how they learn  cultural production skills. Brown describes free and open-source software    292   Chapter 7  as a “completely new kind of learning platform.” Brown endorses tinkering  as an excellent learning methodology, and states that free and open source  software encourages children to practice this methodology: “You are tinker- ing with other people’s stuff. The more you tinker the more you improve”   quoted in Lessig 2004, 46 .  In a paper for the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation on  digital  media  and  learning,  Henry  Jenkins  and  his  coauthors  endorse  an  approach to education in which students use new media to learn how to  engage  in  “participatory  culture,”  which  I  read  as  overlapping  with  Les- sig’s  “free  culture.”  Participatory  culture,  write  Jenkins  et  al.,  encourages  “expressions” that include “digital sampling, skinning and modding, fan  videomaking, fan fiction writing, zines, mash-ups,” and teaches skills such  as  “appropriation—the  ability  to  meaningfully  sample  and  remix  media  content”  Jenkins et al. 2009, 3–4 . Thinking critically about information  and information networks; knowing how to acquire, interpret, and make  media texts in multiple genres; understanding how to parse data and dis- tinguish  between  sources;  learning  to  quote  from  media  texts,  to  gather  evidence and form arguments from their contents for persuasion, critique,  and entertainment; developing techniques for participation in small and  large communities, in both real-world and online collaborations: these are  only  some  of  the  learning  objectives  of  an  educational  program  focused  on  imparting  “new  media  literacies,”  according  to  Jenkins  et  al.   2009,  28–104 . In a similar vein as Lessig, Jenkins et al. claim that acquiring lit- eracy in a digital age “involves the ability to both read and write across all  available modes of expression”  48 . Building on these perspectives, educa- tion scholars Rebecca W. Black and Angela Thomas argue that fan fiction is  a genre of writing through which young people develop core literacy skills.3  This body of work on new media literacies discusses read-write culture par- ticipatory culture free culture as key methods and desirable outcomes for  contemporary education.  Archontic production, a practice in which media consumers treat exist- ing media texts as archives, withdrawing elements they find interesting or  appealing,  tinkering  with  them,  varying  them,  and  incorporating  them  into original creations, thus stands at the heart of a recent reconceptualiza- tion of literacy. Therefore, while it will never be compulsory for individuals  to make use of the freedoms of either free software or free culture, a major  project of educators is to ensure that future generations at least know how  to both “read” and “write” both code and culture.   Archontic Production   293  Archontic Production and Minoritarian Cultures  Education  theorists  argue  that  archontic  production  is  a  critical  compo- nent of the training of future generations, but this type of making has a  long history, particularly in minoritarian communities. Metaphorical uses  of “archive” and related terms to describe culture—especially “dominant”  culture in its many forms, often meaning Western “high” culture or, alter- natively, “mass” culture—as well as references to acts of cultural plunder- ing, extraction, withdrawal and deposit such as those I have described in  this chapter, can be found in many important texts of postcolonial studies,  critical race theory, and feminist theory. Below are a few key examples.  In “Of Mimicry and Man,” Homi Bhabha  1984  writes of the colonial  subject’s  mimicry  of  the  white  colonizer  as  a  “double  articulation.”  The  colonized’s performance of the colonizer, which is “almost the same, but not  quite”   126    which,  later  in  the  essay,  Bhabha  rewrites,  archontically,  as  “Almost the same but not white” [130]  both “‘appropriates’ the [colonizing]  Other” and simultaneously stands as “the sign of the inappropriate,” thus  “pos[ing] an immanent threat to both ‘normalized’ knowledges and disci- plinary power”  126 . The mimicking not quite not white subject looks on  “the founding objects of the Western world” as “the erratic, eccentric, acci- dental objets trouvés [found objects] of the colonial discourse. … It is then  that the body and the book [of the colonizer] lose their representational  authority”  132 . Bhabha here presents the bodies and books of the impe- rial West as objects forming an archive waiting to be found by the colo- nized subject, readymade s  in the Dadaist sense  objets trouvés is a Dadaist  phrase  available for “inappropriate” appropriations and deformations. As  an example of colonized subjects’ proclivity for mimicry that destabilizes  colonial  power,  Bhabha  quotes  a  piece  of  writing  from  a  European  mis- sionary living and working in Bengal in 1817. The missionary writes that  the locals are quite happy to receive the Bibles he hands out, so that they  can use them as “waste paper”  133 : a fanficcing of the Christian West’s  holy book as trash, a conversion of the printed texts of the sacred archive  into disposables.  Nestor Canclini, in Hybrid Cultures, employs archival language to char- acterize local Latin American responses to the ascendance of tourism, met- ropolitan cultures, and global economic and communication flows: “One  seeks to reconvert a heritage or resource … in order to reintegrate it to new  conditions of production and distribution,” Canclini writes, “not only in  the arts but in everyday life and in technological development”  Canclini  1995,  xxvii,  emphasis  added .  So  techniques  and  possessions  from  the    294   Chapter 7  past—those inherited as “heritage” or “resource”—become the source mate- rial for “reconversions,” transformations, and updates, when, for instance,  artisans “connect their traditional craftwork with modern uses in order to  interest urban buyers” or when “indigenous movements … renovate their  demands in transnational politics or in an ecological discourse and learn  to  communicate  these  demands  via  radio,  television,  and  the  Internet”   xxvii . Drawing on another memory framework, Canclini states that there  are “diverse ways in which the members of each group”—ethnic groups,  national groups, and class groups—“appropriate the heterogeneous  reper- toire of goods and messages available in the transnational circuits”  xxviii;  emphasis  added .  A  link  between  Canclini’s  theory  of  hybridity  and  my  idea  of  archontic  production  is  suggested  by  Canclini’s  characterizations  of culture as heritage, as a repository of resources, and as an inherited rep- ertoire—that is, as a past rich with knowledges, skills, objects, and ways of  doing,  each  of  which  can  potentially  be  extracted  and  manipulated  into  something that will be valued in the postmodern, globalized, mediatized  present.  Henry Louis Gates Jr.  1988  writes of “the black English vernacular tra- dition” as “the repository that contains the language that is the source—and  the reflection—of black difference”  xxiii; emphasis added , and Houston  Baker Jr.  1991  calls rap “the ‘in effect’ archive where postmodernism has  been dopely sampled”  208; first emphasis added . Gates frames black Eng- lish vernacular as a repository from which black authors extract valuable  elements with which they can transform and rewrite “the canonical texts  of the Western tradition”  1988, xxii . Gates writes, “Texts have a curious  habit of generating other texts that resemble themselves. … Black literature  shares much with, far more than it differs from, the Western textual tradi- tion. … But black formal repetition always repeats with a difference, a black  difference that manifests itself in specific language use”  xxii–xxiii . In this  analysis, both the white Western literary tradition and the black English  vernacular  tradition  are  “repositories”—what  Gates  deems  a  “two-toned  heritage”   xxiii —from  which  black  writers  make  withdrawals,  and  then  enrich with their own creations, their repetitions-with-a-difference, which  are the works of black American literature.  Baker  pulls  off  a  clever  inversion  with  his  reference  to  rap  as  “the  ‘in  effect’ archive where postmodernism has been dopely sampled.” Rap rou- tinely  makes  use  of  sampled  music,  that  is,  musical  tracks  constructed  from  excerpts  of  already  recorded  music,  and  so  rap  producers  could  be  thought of as making liberal use of the existing archive of recorded sound.  But Baker frames the makers of rap differently: as themselves the creators    Archontic Production   295  of an archive, the archive of rap, which Baker states is “now classical black  sound,” the source from which newer genres, such as “house” and “rap reg- gae,” will “spin off”  Baker 1991, 208 , but which will always acknowledge  rap as the origin. However, in this framing, Baker does not efface rap’s own  origins in appropriation; he acknowledges that the archive of rap contains  samples of preexisting material, but what rap has “dopely” sampled, Baker  declares,  is  postmodernism  itself,  the  entire  artistic  and  cultural  move- ment of unconstrained raids of past culture that is, writes Frederic Jameson,  “stored up in the imaginary museum of a now global culture”  1984, 65 .  Against the stereotype of rap producers as “thieves” who sample without  paying  copyright  holders,  Baker  characterizes  rap  producers  as  cultural  sophisticates who take from the global postmodern movement what they  wish, and practice postmodern stylistic flourishes to construct an archive of  a new “classical” black music, an archive that will be highly generative, an  open space rather than a closed room.  We  also  find  an  appearance  of  the  archival  motif  in  Gayatri  Spivak’s  powerful  interpretation  of  Jean  Rhys’s  Wide  Sargasso  Sea:  Spivak   1985   suggests that Charlotte Brontë’s masterpiece Jane Eyre “can be read as the  orchestration and staging of the self-immolation of Bertha Mason as ‘good  wife’”  259 , and states that her reading of Jane Eyre derives from “a mod- est  and  inexpert  ‘reading’  of  ‘archives’”   emphasis  added ,  by  which  she  means “the archives of imperialist governance”  259 . In other words, Spi- vak argues that we cannot understand the full meaning of Bertha Mason’s  actions “if we remain insufficiently knowledgeable about the history of the  legal manipulation of widow-sacrifice in the entitlement of the British gov- ernment in India”  Spivak 1985, 259 . Spivak reads Bertha as archontically  conceived, born of Brontë’s engagement with “the archives of imperialist  governance”  however unconsciously this archival research may have been  done .  But  I  would  also  position  Jane  Eyre  as  itself  part  of  the  imperial- ist archive, or as an instantiation of an imperialist  metaphorical  archive,  from which Rhys, who was born and raised in the West Indies, felt com- pelled to extract the character of Bertha, so that she could transform and  redeem the story of the West Indian “madwoman,” locked for years in the  attic by her English gentleman husband  under “house arrest,” like the con- tents of a nineteenth century archive .  Thus, in minoritarian critics’ explorations of appropriative writing, we  find numerous invocations and allusions to archives as sources source code  whose contents are available to be reworked, revised, elaborated, extended,  and  expanded  upon.  Hence,  my  term  “archontic  production”  does  not  name any altogether new, or specifically digital, ways of making culture,    296   Chapter 7  and does not attempt to theorize what has never been theorized before, but  serves only as an overarching term for appropriative creativity, which has  often been described through metaphorical references to archives, reposi- tories, heritage, repertoires, and other forms of memory preservation and  retrieval.  Political Potentialities  Archontic  production  definitely  does  not  always  serve  the  interests  of  minority discourses. It does not always take the form of counterhegemonic  narratives.  Education  and  gender  studies  theorists  Peter  McLaren  and  Rhonda Hammer underscore that media images are often manipulated in  order to reinforce neocolonial capitalist power structures and racist sexist  classist jingoistic stereotypes. They write: “Of serious concern in our own  work is how electronic prophets … have been able to turn wimp presidents  into wrathful avengers and an often frustrated and self-hating citizenry into  phallomilitary  warrior  citizens  who  are  conditioned  to  redirect  a  media- instilled hatred of ‘Sad’am’ and various dark-skinned others against a famil- iar enemy within its own ranks: the poor, the homeless, people of color,  those who comprise the detritus of capitalism and white man’s democracy,  those who are already oppressed by race, gender, caste, and circumstance”   McLaren and Hammer 1996, 109 . In these examples, the US president, no  matter who he is, is “fanficced” as a powerful warrior-leader, worthy of his  constituents’ devotion; Saddam Hussein is “fanficced” as a mass of abject  and or nonwhite Americans, deserving only of loathing and scorn. Even  though McLaren and Hammer are here commenting on the power of right- wing media to edit news footage in ways that reinforce specific ideological  messages, the authors acknowledge that it is not only broadcasting corpora- tions who can treat recorded images as the source materials for freshly spun  narratives.  In response to the power of both mass media and individual media mak- ers  to  archontically  produce  reactionary,  prejudiced,  discriminatory,  and  imperialist media texts using the vast archive of recorded culture made elec- tronically available, McLaren and Hammer desire an educational landscape  that would teach all citizens to become aware of how archontic production  operates, and how they personally can engage in it. Like other media lit- eracy advocates, McLaren and Hammer call for the education of a popu- lace that would be well versed in the use of media-as-archive, from which  a potentially infinite number of divergent narratives can be constructed,  so that individuals and communities, especially those occupying minority    Archontic Production   297  positions vis-à-vis existing hegemonies, can generate their own archontic  “counternarratives.” Citing Paul Willis’s Common Culture  1990 , McLaren  and Hammer  1996  argue that “high culture or official culture has lost its  dominance”  109 , and that “the main seeds of cultural development are  to be found in the commercial provision of cultural commodities”  110 .  Widespread media literacy, of which “reading” and “writing” archontically  is a core component, would ensure that the power of archontic production  is not concentrated in the hands of a select few—the professionals of the  cultural industries—but is wielded by many, as what Willis terms “everyday  symbolic work”  Willis 1990, 136  and what McLaren and Hammer  1996,  110  name “creative symbolic work within informal culture,” which “offers  important possibilities for ‘oppositional, independent or alternative sym- bolizations of the self.’”  Willis,  like  the  postcolonial,  African-American,  and  feminist  theorists  cited  above,  frames  culture  as  an  archive  to  be  mined  when  he  states,  “Where  everyday  symbolic  work  differs  from  what  is  normally  thought  of as ‘education’ is that it ‘culturally produces’—from its own chosen cul- tural  resources.  Psychologically,  at  least,  the  informal  symbolic  workers  of  common  cultures  feel  they  really  ‘own’  and  can  therefore  manipulate  their resources as materials and tools—unlike the books at school which are  ‘owned’ by the teachers”  Willis 1990, 136 . Media literacy then, involves  a perspective on culture, all of culture, as a shared set of “resources” that  each user feels she or he owns  whether they own copyright over specific  cultural  products  or  not ,  and  therefore,  feels  entitled  to  “manipulate  …  as materials and tools.” Media literacy is less interested in legal definitions  of intellectual property than with a perception, attitude, and belief system  that should—even must—be encouraged among media audiences, which  is:  that  every  consumer  is  a  potential  user  of  media;  that  users  can  seize  upon all of media and culture as an archive and plunder its elements as  the  bases  for  their  own  productions;  and  that  when  users  circulate  their  archontic productions, either to their own communities  minority groups,  fandoms,  subcultures,  activist  organizations   or  to  a  wider  public,  they  exercise their power to make statements and stories that have meaning for  them—personally, politically, or both—out of the images, texts, personas,  data,  and  narratives  that  saturate  their  lives  via  global  media.  Advocates  for media literacy wish for the “empire to write back,” as Salman Rushdie   1982  put it. In coining this phrase, Rushdie was writing of the subjects of  formal European and American imperial projects, but if we consider that  the culture industries aim to colonize and occupy the minds and hearts of  consumers, then it is audiences who are the subjects, who are the “empire”    298   Chapter 7  conquered and won by global media, and who must individually and col- lectively assert their rights and abilities to govern and determine their own  emotional, psychological, and intellectual lives. This self-governance and  self-determination often takes the form of a negotiation with mass media  rather than an absolute resistance to it; it is a reduction of mass media to  base matter from which local meanings can be constructed, rather than a  rejection of all the riches that media has to offer.  Archontic production is not, therefore, necessarily or essentially minori- tarian, but potentialities for democratizing, polyvocal, hybridizing, multi- perspectival cultural production inhere in it. These political potentialities  have been fruitfully developed by scores of postcolonial, ethnic minority,  and  women  authors,  who   as  the  theorists  quoted  above  note   often  are  culturally colonized by dominant power structures at the level of the very  languages they speak, the ideas they think, and the beliefs they hold, and  must therefore attempt to decolonize themselves and their communities by  launching new ways of speaking, thinking, and believing from within the  dominant  discourse,  by  atomizing,  mutating,  and  recombining  that  dis- course into expressions of marginalized realities and fantasies.  Consumer Memory versus User Memory  Archontic production’s most salient promise is the promise of transforming  mass media “markets” into media’s masters—turning the targets of global  media flows into the containers and directors of those flows: archivists of  the mass of media texts, and liberal users and elaborators of those archives. In Acting Out  2009; published in French in 2003 , philosopher Bernard  Stiegler expresses similar concerns to those articulated by Max Horkheimer  and Theodor Adorno in their 1944 book Dialectic of Enlightenment, fram- ing his anxiety about mass media not as a suspicion that they equal “mass  deception” but that they exercise control over human memory. For Stiegler,  human  memory  consists  of  three  forms  of  retention:  primary  retention,  which belongs “to the present of perception,” that is, listening to a melody  and remembering each note as it passes, so that one can link the stream  of notes together and make sense of the tune; secondary retention, which  Stiegler calls “the past of my consciousness,” by which one remembers the  melody heard the day before and is able to “hear [it] again in imagination  by the play of memory”; and tertiary retention, “a prosthesis of exterior- ized  memory”   54 ,  which  can  produce  “the  identical  repetition  of  the  same  temporal  object”  and  exists  in  the  forms  of  recording  technologies  such as “phonograms, … films, and radio and television broadcasts”  54 .    Archontic Production   299  Stiegler argues that tertiary retentions, “or “tertiarized temporal objects,”  “are  materialized  time,  which  overdetermines  the  relations  between  pri- mary and secondary retentions in general, thus, in a sense, permitting their  control”   Stiegler  [2003]  2009,  54;  emphases  in  original .  In  other  words,  Stiegler claims that by watching the same broadcasts  tertiary retentions  en  masse, at the same time of day every day  he gives the example of watching  the  evening  news ,  our  primary  and  secondary  retentions  are  becoming  more synchronized: “[Media audiences] end up being so well synchronized  that they have lost their diachrony, that is, their singularity, which is to say  their liberty, which always means their liberty to think”  55; emphases in  original .  Setting  aside  the  fact  that  time-shifting  has  become  a  routine  part  of  television consumption for millions of people, and so television broadcasts  do  not  automatically  require,  or  induce,  precise  synchronization  among  viewers, I find it interesting that Stiegler identifies collective and individual   he would say, individuated  memory as the battleground for determining  whether, and to what extent, mass media control audiences. I do not think  it is out of the question that people lose their “diachrony,” “singularity,”  “liberty,” or “liberty to think” by having their memory functions more or  less determined by the media they consume. But the person who surrenders  his or her memory function to mass media is a person whom I would char- acterize as a media illiterate.  My theory of archontic production is that a person literate in the con- temporary cultural forms of her day, a person who can adequately “read”  the media formats that she regularly encounters, comprehends how these  forms  work  as  tertiary  memory,  but  does  not  let  that  imposed  memory  wholly define, restrict, or limit her own primary and secondary memory  systems. Rather, a person with high media literacy treats tertiary memory  products  as  potentially  useful  and  interesting  wellsprings  from  which  to  make  new  primary  and  secondary  retentions—what  I  call  archontic  pro- ductions—which can be highly individual  experienced privately, as when  one has a personal interpretation of a cultural work, remembering specific  details about it both as one first encounters the work and then later, when  one recalls the work and perhaps imagines more detailed interpretations  or variations of the work , or can be collective and shared, as when one  “releases”  one’s  interpretations  or  versions  of  a  cultural  work  to  a  com- munity of fellow developers rememberers memory workers. Media literacy  can be a kind of memory work in which tertiary memory is not the termi- nus of cultural experience, but the beginning of a series of experiences—a  kind of memory work that spins out chains of unique and singular primary    300   Chapter 7  and secondary retentions of ever-new derivations and transformations of  an initial viewing or listening.  Thus,  I  locate  archontic  production’s  political  stakes  first  of  all  in  the  question of whether the individuals who make up media markets can make  themselves into media users, by learning and practicing the skills of media  literacy, which are the skills of “reading” and then “writing” media. Mem- bers of marginalized groups may have maximal incentives to learn how to  speak, write, and create from within hegemonic discourses, as appropriat- ing the languages, literatures, and media of the groups who oppress them  can be a first step in communicating their radical differences from those  groups  Bertha Mason is Charlotte Brontë’s “madwoman in the attic,” but  she is Jean Rhys’s troubled West Indian heroine, seduced and then trapped  by English colonial patriarchy . But archontic production’s basic promise  is that of striking the category of “media consumer” and replacing it with  “media user”: the archontic producer does not allow her consciousness, her  singularity, her liberty to think, her memories, to be colonized or controlled  by media, but engages with the media as a generative source for her own  memory-based creativity. Write McLaren and Hammer, citing Willis  1990 :  “Human  beings  must  not  be  regarded  merely  as  human  capital  or  labor  power, but as ‘creative citizens, full of their own sensuous symbolic capaci- ties and activities and taking a hand in the construction of their own iden- tities.’ The pursuit of emancipation and equality, therefore, requires more  than being made equal as workers. It calls for all to be fully developed as  cultural producers”  McLaren and Hammer 1996, 110 . Archontic production  thus is not only political when it serves as a tool with which subordinate  peoples critique or subvert dominant discourses. Insofar as the vast major- ity of people are potentially subjected to mass media, and are therefore per- petually in danger of becoming a subjected mass—what Martin Heidegger   2008   calls  the  they   “das  Man” 4—I  see  archontic  production’s  primary  political value as serving to constantly facilitate and affirm cultural expres- sions of what Stiegler calls “the I” or “an ensemble of Is in the interior of a  we”  [2003] 2009, 80 . Either the culture industries make of us a “they,” or  “I” “we” use cultural commodities for our own ends.  Repertoire in Archontic Production  Although  I  have  referred  to  the  GNU Linux  software  development  as  a  model  for  understanding  what  I  mean  by  archontic  production,  a  much  older model comes up again and again in the writings of cultural theorists  to describe creative appropriation: performance.   Archontic Production   301  In  The  Uses  of  Literacy   1957 ,  Richard  Hoggart,  who  would  go  on  to  found the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of  Birmingham  in  1964,  defends  the  working-class  culture  that  he  grew  up  with  in  the  1930s.  Hoggart  argues  that  working-class  people  do  not  care  much about mass marketed music recordings, “no matter how much Tin  Pan Alley plugs them”  1957, 117 , and become attached to popular songs  only when they can “take them over”: “‘After the Ball is Over’ is a melo- dramatic  song;  it  is  not  even  a  people’s  song  as  the  ballads  were,  but  a  commercial song taken over by the people; but they have taken it on their  own terms, and so it is not for them as poor a thing as it might have been”   119 . In their landmark writings on fandom and remix published decades  later, Henry Jenkins and Lawrence Lessig both refer to nineteenth-century  folk performance as a precedent for digital appropriation, Lessig discussing  the preponderance of amateur reperformances of popular songs and ditties  in the late 1800s and early 1900s  Lessig 2008, 23–28 , and Jenkins point- ing to the multitude of combinations of “folk traditions taken from various  indigenous and immigrant populations” serving as the basis of US popular  culture during that same period  Jenkins 2006, 135 . Using a language of  plunder that accords well with my concept of archontic production, Jen- kins writes that in the United States in the second half of the 1800s, “there  was no pure boundary between the emergent commercial culture and the  residual folk culture: the commercial culture raided folk culture and folk  culture raided commercial culture”  135 .  Similarly,  performance  figures  largely  in  Bhabha’s  concept  of  mimicry   which is, first and foremost, a physical act: Bhabha writes, for example, of  “the  white  presence  and  its  black  semblance”  [1984,  129]  when  discuss- ing the uneasy coexistence of European colonizers and colonized Africans  or  Indians ;  in  Gates’s   1988   idea  of  the  “black  vernacular  tradition”—a  spoken tradition, a verbal tradition—as a repository whose contents suffuse  black literature; and in Baker’s “‘in effect’ archive” of rap music, whose suc- cess is judged more by the responses of live audiences than by record sales:  “Technology can create a rap disc, but only the voice dancing to wheels of  steel and producing a hip hopping, responsive audience gives testimony to  a full-filled break. You ain’t busted a move, in other words, until the audi- ence lets you know you’re in the groove”  Baker 1991, 202 .  One of the clearest articulations of appropriation as performance can be  found in Dick Hebdige’s 1987 book on Caribbean popular music, Cut ’n’  Mix. In the book’s opening pages, Hebdige foregrounds the concept of “ver- sioning,” which he borrows from Jamaican reggae: “One of the most impor- tant words in reggae is ‘version.’ Sometimes a reggae record is released and    302   Chapter 7  literally hundreds of different versions of the same rhythm or melody will  follow in its wake. Every time a version is released, the original tune will  be slightly modified. … ‘Versioning’ is at the heart not only of reggae but  of all Afro-American and Caribbean musics”  Hebdige 1987, xiii . Hebdige  goes on to argue that versioning is central not just to all black music but  to all popular music  he cites Albert Goodman’s description of young Elvis  Presley as a “marvelous mimic,” whose “art lay not in an act of substan- tive creation but in a recasting of one traditional style in terms of another”  [xiv] , and not just to all music but to all creativity and scholarship:  Just as Elvis used the voices and the vocal styles of the other singers, so I have bor- rowed Albert Goldman’s voice and style to say something about “versioning.” That’s  what a quotation in a book or on a record is. It’s an invocation of someone else’s  voice to help you say what you want to say. … And every time the other voice is bor- rowed in this way, it is turned away slightly from what it was the original author or  singer or musician thought they were saying, singing, playing. … That’s the beauty  of quotation. The original version takes on a new life and a new meaning in a fresh  context. Just like a rhythm or a melody which is brought in from another source in  a record or in the live performance of a piece of music. They’re just different kinds  of quotation. And that’s the beauty, too, of versioning. It’s a democratic principle  because it implies that no one has the final say. Everybody has a chance to make a  contribution. And no one’s version is treated as Holy Writ.  xv 5  Fan fiction has also been theorized in terms of performance. Francesca  Coppa   2006b   argues  that  fan  fiction  offering  new  versions  of  familiar  characters is akin to theater companies constantly reimagining and stag- ing new productions of plays. “An endless number of Shakespearean pro- ductions  supplement  the  texts,  adding  meanings  that  Shakespeare  never  intended and making them meaningful to twenty-first century audiences.  There’s no reason not to see this as a perfectly valid artistic activity,” writes  Coppa. Fan fiction revisions and extensions of media texts are “inevitable,”  states Coppa, “and they aren’t any more redundant than multiple produc- tions of Hamlet”  Coppa 2006b, 238 . Thus, Coppa calls fandom “commu- nity theatre in a mass media world”  242 .  Versioning is a key term in software development, and it is a key term  in performance. Since performance has been integral to human culture far  longer than computer programming has, and because all humans perform  versions of the cultural works they consume  if only in their imaginations,  when they recall and ponder works of art or media they have seen, or when  they  are  alone  and  sing  popular  songs  to  themselves,  or  when  they  talk  about their interpretations of books or television shows to their friends ,  the metaphor of performance, and actual genres of performance, provide    Archontic Production   303  useful reference points for writers who wish to explain media literacy, that  is, the ability of media audiences to collectively create a plethora of variants  of any given source. The fact that the language and concept of performance  is so often invoked by cultural theorists to describe practices of transforma- tion and remix permits an unusual perspective on free software develop- ment, bringing into focus a kinship between GNU Linux programmers and  folk, reggae, and rap artists, and drawing coding and community theater  into relation. Jeremy Rifkin links performance to archontic production, ver- sioning, and transformative reuse when he writes about what he calls “the  new ‘protean’ generation”: “Theirs is a world that is more theatrical than  ideological and oriented more to a play ethos, than to a work ethos”  Rifkin  2001, 12 .  So, my theory of archontic production turns out to be equally concerned  with  repertoires—cultural  memory  transmitted  through  performance—as  with archives and archiving. In earlier sections, I argued that the structure  of  digital  archives  privileges  repertoire,  as  every  digital  archive  does  not  remain stable on its own, but depends on archivists constantly repeating  certain routines of archive maintenance over time. The contents of digital  archives often consist of versions and variations of source texts: archivists  at  Project  Gutenberg  and  Open  Library  create  digital  versions  of  printed  books;  archivists  at  the  Internet  Archive  create  digital  versions  of  film,  video, and sound recordings; archivists at the AO3 store numerous elabora- tions on media sources; archivists at ibiblio preserve GNU Linux develop- ers’ releases of their extensions of the Linux kernel. To say that these digital  transmediations  and  appropriations  are  forms  of  “archontic  production”  references the memory mode of archive—the treatment of bodies of preex- isting texts as archives from which any user can withdraw the raw materi- als for new projects—and the memory mode of repertoire—the process by  which  humans  receive  cultural  matter  in  their  bodies  and,  by  using  their  bodies as playback machines, perform works that they record  via primary  retention  in their own ways, making up their own imaginative transforma- tions of the works  via process of secondary retention .  Humans are the models for all recording and playback devices, for stor- age and replay are faculties innate to the human body and psyche. Film  and media historian Jane Gaines, writing on the development of intellec- tual property law around sound recording, argues that the “inevitability”  of  popular  music’s  “use  and  re-use,  imitation,  and  re-creation”  is  “pre- figured  by  the  body’s  own  sound  collection  and  reproduction  apparatus,  the  prototype  for  the  mechanical  and  electronic  record store playback  functions:  listening,  remembering,  speaking,  or  singing”   Gaines  1991,    304   Chapter 7  128–129 . In “The Storyteller,” Walter Benjamin shares a similar observa- tion about the human listener as a memory-and-reproduction device: “It  has seldom been realized that the listener’s naïve relationship to the story- teller is controlled by his interest in retaining what he is told. The cardinal  point  for  the  unaffected  listener  is  to  assure  himself  of  the  possibility  of  reproducing the story. Memory is the epic faculty par excellence”  Benjamin  [1936] 1968, 97 .  Benjamin  is  not  employing  “epic”  as  an  adjective  here,  as  we  would  in contemporary vernacular speech, but as a noun. It is through memory  that an epic story is disseminated, through the bodies of storytellers who  reperform  what  they  have  heard  and  stored;  it  is  through  this  combina- tion of memory and reperformance that the epic is preserved. “The greater  …  the  story’s  claim  to  a  place  in  the  memory  of  the  listener,  the  more  completely it is integrated into his own experience, the greater will be his  inclination  to  repeat  it  to  someone  else  someday,  sooner  or  later”   91 ,  states  Benjamin,  describing  the  epic  listener-turned-storyteller  but  also  offering a strikingly accurate definition of the media fan. For what is a fan,  but  a  listener,  an  audience  member,  who  pays  deep  attention  to  a  story,  who awards it a place in her memory, who integrates it into her own expe- rience,  and  then  feels  inclined  to  repeat  it  to  someone  else,  someday,  in  her own fashion?  Benjamin and Gaines, like Hoggart, Lessig, Jenkins, Bhabha, Baker, Heb- dige,  and  Coppa,  recognize  that  the  human  receiver  does  not  “purely”  reproduce  what  she  or  he  takes  in,  but  delivers  a  new  rendering  of  the  recorded work. These theorists present creative appropriation as an act of  memory that gives onto an act of versioning, which, in their shared view, is  a performative act, an act best understood through references and compari- sons to performance styles, such as singing and playing music, retelling a  story, imitating another through gesture and voice, speaking in a vernacu- lar, sampling and rapping on a record but then playing that record for a  crowd. To engage in archontic production means to seize on a cultural work  as an archive rich with usable resources, and it also means to put that work,  or its elements, into one’s personal repertoire. One dives into the archive of  a work and expands that archive through versioning it, as a reggae singer  versions, as a rapper or sampling artist versions, as a postcolonial subject  versions, as Rhys versioned Brontë, as free software programmers version  GNU Linux. Versioning is what happens when you have something in your  repertoire, and you play it, your way.   Archontic Production   305  The Bloom from the Kernel, or The Dynarchive  Benjamin writes of an story from ancient Egypt that was told one way by  Herodotus, and another way by Montaigne centuries later. Benjamin states,  “it [the story] resembles the seeds of grain which have lain for centuries in  the chambers of the pyramids shut up air-tight and have retained their ger- minative power to this day”  Benjamin [1936] 1968, 90 . Benjamin mourns  the passing of this style of storytelling; he regrets, to an extent, the rise of  the  novel  and  the  short  story,  genres  that  circulate  in  the  format  of  the  single book that purports to stand alone and apart from other stories. The  seemingly self-enclosed text “has removed itself from oral tradition and no  longer permits that slow piling one on top of the other of thin, transparent  layers which constitutes the most appropriate picture of the way in which  the perfect narrative is revealed through the layers of a variety of retellings”   93 .  The  “picture”  with  which  Benjamin  presents  us  here—a  layering  of  a  variety of retellings of the same story, a cumulative, accretive progression  that  Benjamin  claims  does  not  obscure  the  “original”  story,  but  instead  reveals the perfect narrative, as if the perfection of the narrative is proven  by  its  generative,  “germinative”  power—closely  maps  onto  the  image  of  the GNU Linux Distribution timeline in figure 7.1, and onto my clumsy  visualization of Mad Max fan fiction production in figure 7.3. Both figures  illustrate branches stemming sideways from a single source; they are what  Manuel Lima  2014  calls “horizontal trees.” As I mentioned above, I call  these types of diagrams, and the many-authored multiplications they rep- resent, “the bloom from the kernel.” Henry Jenkins, Sam Ford, and Joshua  Green   2013   would  say  they  show  the  “spread”  of  digital  phenomena.  Ernst  2013  would call these images of “the dynarchive.”  If print culture suppressed Benjamin’s picture of the “slow piling one on  top of the other of thin, transparent layers” of narrative by installing the  singular published book as the sole, complete bearer of a story, then digital  culture lifts the ban on the “oral tradition” and assists a massive resurrec- tion of its techniques: the piling, the layering, the retellings, all of which  serve to reveal the robust life force of the seed, the kernel, the source, from  which so many versions can germinate, sprout, bloom. Digital technolo- gies do not only help users metaphorically use media as archives, they also  enable users to actually archive their archontic productions. Many digital  archives,  if  mapped,  would  be  shown  to  follow  a  bloom-from-the-kernel  pattern. Many digital archives, certainly all of the rogue archives in which  I  am  interested,  are  committed  to  archiving  versions.  And  again,  we  are    306   Chapter 7  forced  to  rethink  how  archive  relates  to  repertoire,  for  what  the  bloom- from-the-kernel  illustrates  is  the  archiving  of  repertoire.  Digital  archives  store, preserve, and keep accessible, the unfolding of whole repertoires over  time; they are invested in saving each release, each new distribution. If only  every performance of a play, no matter how good or bad, no matter how  small or large, no matter the size of its audience, could be archived—this is  the logic of digital archives.  Noah  Wardrip-Fruin  summarizes  Ted  Nelson’s  and  others’  “dream  of  hypermedia” and the dream of digital archiving to which it gave rise. The  dream, which I also cited in chapter 1, is:  That in a not-so-distant future, we read and write  view and draw, hear and com- pose  most everything from and to a world-spanning computer network. That every- one have the ability to produce their own documents, and connect them with any  other public documents. That the author may constantly create new versions of her  or his own document, and individuals may create their own versions of any public  document and that public connections made between one version of one document  and  another  version  of  another  will  usually  automatically  place  themselves  in  all  the extant versions. That historical backtrack and degradation-proof storage allows  us to visit any version, any moment in the network’s history. To have the ultimate  archive, and yet have each element of the archive constantly in process. Dynamism  without loss. Impermanence enfolded within permanence.  Wardrip-Fruin 2000   Ernst  describes  the  dream  of  digital  archiving  thus:  “The  object-oriented  archive  …  takes  shape  cumulatively,  entailing  a  shift  from  read-only  paradigms to a generative, participative form of archival reading. Source- oriented stock and classical file-oriented archive practices yield to the use- oriented  ‘to be completed’  ‘dynarchive’”  Ernst 2013, 81–82 .  The hypothetical digital archive described by Wardrip-Fruin and Ernst is  full of user contributions. The dynarchive constantly transforms and grows  as it attracts and locks down new releases, and keeps a record of the links  between entries, hosting entire families of entries and not just “final” ver- sions   if  there  are  such  things .  This  dream  of  “impermanence  enfolded  within permanence,” of repertoires stored within archives, has been real- ized  to  the  extent  that  there  exist  archives  and  archivists  whose  mission  it is to preserve the blooms that emit from kernels. Although there is no  “dynamism without loss,” and we must have serious questions and doubts  regarding the “permanence” of any digital archive, the present moment is  one in which archontic production takes place on a vast scale, and not all  of it is lost.   Break 7  Licensing and Licentiousness Break  Licensing   and   7 Licentiousness  E. Gabriella Coleman writes that free software hackers have defended their  right  to  exercise  “productive  freedom”  in  large  part  by  constructing  cer- tain  “legal  devices”   2012,  3 ,  that  is,  licenses.  Licenses  play  a  large  part  in the free software and free culture movements, which arose in opposi- tion to far-reaching legal moves made by large copyright-holding organiza- tions, beginning with the Copyright Act of 1976. Christopher Kelty states  that  this  Copyright  Act  was  “largely  organized  around  new  technologies  like photocopier machines, home audiotaping, and the new videocassette  recorders”  2008, 202 . Over the next two decades, the new media devel- oped into a robust infrastructure for a digital culture marked by, as Cole- man  writes,  “information  access,  open  content,  and  collaboration”   83 ,  which rendered “major corporate copyright owners … aghast at the pro- miscuous file sharing enabled by a broadband connection, a home desktop  computer,  and  peer-to-peer  systems”   Coleman  2012,  84 .  The  copyright  industries lobbied extensively for the US Congress to radically expand the  reach of copyright law, and their efforts resulted in the passing of the Copy- right  Term  Extension  Act   CTEA   and  Digital  Millennium  Copyright  Act   DMCA  in 1998, which put severe restrictions on digital activities such as  software hacking and cultural remixing, and sharply contracted the public  domain. The free software and free culture communities responded by cre- ating their own legal mechanisms, intended to protect reusers from being  labeled “rogues, thieves, and pirates,” in Kavita Philip’s  2005  phrasing.  These legal mechanisms were new licenses, including the GNU General  Public License  GPL , the GNU Free Documentation License, Creative Com- mons licenses, and the Open Content License, which digital content cre- ators—what Philip calls “technological authors” in “amateur, educational,  and entrepreneurial contexts”  2005, 203 —can employ to protect them- selves  and  future  reusers  from  prosecution  for  copyright  infringement.  Kelty  argues  that  these  licenses  offer  hackers  and  remixers  “a  back-door    308   Break 7  approach” to the CTEA and DMCA: “if the [new copyright] laws could not  be changed, then people should be given the tools they needed to work  around those laws”  2008, 260 .  Licensing  does  not  carry  the  same  import  in  media  fan  communities  that it does in free software communities and in many groups that explic- itly  operate  in  accord  with  Creative  Commons  principles.  This  is  not  to  say that fans are unaware of, or unconcerned with, legal threats. Fans, like  all categories of remixers, have received legal threats in the form of cease- and-desist letters  three people interviewed by my research team said they  have dealt with legal notices claiming that fan fiction is a form of copyright  infringement , and the Organization of Transformative Works  OTW  has a  Legal Advocacy division designed to “be proactive in protecting and defend- ing  fanworks  from  commercial  exploitation  and  legal  challenge,”  which  has  among other legal actions  successfully petitioned the US Copyright  Office to approve exemptions to the DMCA that allow fans to legally make  noncommercial,  transformative  videos.  However,  licensing  does  not  take  center stage in fans’ debates and discussions around legal defense, probably  because fans perceive themselves to always and only occupy the position of  content users, and only content creators may append licenses such as the  GPL or Creative Commons licenses to their productions.  Another way to interpret the situation of fans vis-à-vis licensing is that  fans simply act “as if” official content creators license fans to make deriva- tive works. In other words, fans have always behaved as though they already  possess  licenses  to  transform  copyrighted  texts  for  noncommercial  uses.  They have never waited for copyright holders to modify their legal rights  through  Creative  Commons  licenses.  Fans  have  operated  under  a  shared  assumption that, so long as they do not sell their fannish productions for  profit, they are not infringing on copyright—which amounts to an assump- tion that the culture industries’ distribute their products under a Creative  Commons  Attribution-NonCommercial  4.0  International  License,  even  though Hollywood studios and major publishing houses and record labels  and game companies will likely never make use of this license. Fans do not  think much about licensing, in other words, because they take license with  copyrighted works, rather than founding new forms of legal protection.  That licensing is so foregrounded by free software and by some free cul- ture communities, but does not carry the same significance in media fan- dom, illustrates that what Kelty calls “norms” of use precede legal devices  such as licenses. Kelty writes, “For Creative Commons, norms are a prele- gal and pretchnical substrate upon which the licenses they create operate.  Norms must exist for the strategy employed in the licenses to make sense”    Licensing and Licentiousness   309   2008, 293 . Because licenses do not bring norms into being, but only serve  to codify norms that are already in play, media fans could establish their  norms of noncommercial, transformative uses of copyrighted works wholly  apart from the licensing innovations of Stallman and Creative Commons. Fans’  tradition  of  behaving  as  if  they  are  licensed  to  produce  archon- tic  works—their  taking  license  with  copyrighted  media—marks  them  as  rogues,  according  to  Derrida’s  definition.  As  I  discussed  in  the  introduc- tion,  Jacques  Derrida   2005   associates  roguishness  with  democracy,  and  traces a convergence between the democrat’s liberty and the roué’s license.  Derrida writes, “We must never forget that [Plato’s] portrait of the democrat  associates freedom or liberty  eleutheria  with license  exousia , which is also  whim, free will, freedom of choice, leisure to follow one’s desires, ease, facil- ity, the faculty or power to do as one pleases”  2005, 22 . Because “freedom  is essentially the faculty or power to do as one pleases, to decide, to choose”   22 , a question emerges about how a democracy can hope to service all  the free people who make up its constituency. But the taking of liberties,  the taking-license, the insistence on freedom that characterizes the rogue  also, to some extent, enables the rogue’s ability to thrive in democracy, for,  states Derrida, “democracy contains all the different kinds of constitutions,  of regimes or states. If one wants to found a state, all one has to do is go to a  democracy to pick out the paradigm of one’s choice. As in a market, there is  no shortage of paradeigmata”  2005, 26 . Democracy is not one kind of con- figuration or association or “constitution,” it is a framework that offers the  choice of many types of organization. Thus different segments of US society  try to bring about different legal systems within that democracy, trying to  “pick out” the legal paradigm that best suits their needs: the culture indus- tries strive for heavy copyright protection; the free software movement and  Creative  Commons  attempt  to  “defend  the  electronic  commons  against  corporate  privatization”  by  writing  new  licenses   Philip  2005,  207 ;  and  fans aim at a third paradigm, one in which they “do as they please” without  seeking advance permission.  This is an important way in which free software and fandom do not coin- cide: fandom is more licentious than the license-based activity of free soft- ware development. Fans are even more likely than free software hackers to  show a “subversive disrespect for principles, norms, and good manners, for  the rules and laws that govern the circle of decent, self-respecting people,  of respectable, right-thinking society”  Derrida 2005, 20 —to be “promis- cuous”  Coleman 2012, 84  in the connections they make between media  texts and digital networks, to hook up random elements of mass culture  with their own imaginations and with unknown Internet users, to share    310   Break 7  liberally and connect somewhat indiscriminately—to be “rogues, thieves,  and pirates”  Philip 2005 . Rather than “distinguishing illegal sharing from  good, creative sharing,” seeking to make itself safe by distancing itself from  piracy or other copyright-defiant practices as the Creative Commons and  other licensing bodies do  Philip 2005, 207 , media fandom on the whole  does not dwell on the need to create new legal devices for its own protec- tion  a specific body of fan volunteers within the OTW does pay a great deal  of attention to legal matters and legal questions regarding fan production,  and they do so precisely because so much of fandom does not think over- much on these matters . Most fans, acting within the norms formed over  time by their communities, simply act on their “whim, free will, freedom of  choice, leisure to follow one’s desires.”  Kelty writes that conflicts between disciplines that have differing views   of reuse and transformation  can be governed either by the legal specification of rights contained in … licenses …  or by the customary means of collaboration enabled, perhaps enhanced, by software  tools. The former is the domain of the state, the legal profession, and a moral and  technical order that, for lack of a better word, might be called modernity. The latter,  however,  is  the  domain  of  the  cultural,  the  informal,  the  practical,  the  interper- sonal; it is the domain of ethics  prior to its modernization, perhaps  and of tradition.   2008, 291   Fandom operates in the latter realm, adhering to its tradition, its ethic, its  informal and practical history of licentiousness.  The roguish behavior that fans exhibit with regards to copyright; their  unrestrained fooling around with culture; their assertion of what Derrida  calls “the ‘I can’ … ‘it is possible for me’ … ‘I am free to’ … ‘I can decide’”   2005, 23  with respect to products that are marketed to them as fixed and  final; their seizure of commodity culture as a kind of inheritance, which  prompts and fuels their leisure and pleasure; their treatment of mass media  as a legacy that is not willed to them by its owners, but of which they nev- ertheless feel entitled to take possession, like presumptuous bastards; their  enthusiastic generation of “bastard” derivatives of officially issued, legally  owned  texts;  their  positioning  themselves  as  the  heirs  and  successors  to  the paid professionals of the culture industries despite their lack of legal  claim; their frequently performing, in the femaleness and queerness of their  productions  their frequent and explicit focus on affect, romance, and sex,  often exceeding the boundaries of narrative normativity and heteronorma- tivity ,  what  Derrida  calls  the  “sexual  connotations”  of  roguishness,  the  “playful and the lustful, the shameless, lewd, and dissolute, the licentious    Licensing and Licentiousness   311  and  libertine”  aspects  that  always  inhere  in  the  idea  of  the  rogue   2005,  22 ; their enthusiastically turning away from the neoliberal requirement of  nonstop work in order to embrace “worklessness, the interruption of labor,”  which Derrida points out is the “original meaning of debauchery”  20 , even  as they work, hard, at growing and sustaining their derided tradition  the  activities of the rogue look like nothing more than frivolous pastimes from  the outside, but the rogue knows how much effort is required to be so much  at ease : all of these licentious attitudes and acts of fandom make Internet  fan communities and archives not utopic but heterotopic, not nonplaces  but  in Michel Foucault’s [1986] wording  “other spaces,” whose alternate  cultural logics and practices may ally with license-based movements such  as free software and the Creative Commons, but which always exist before,  and to a great extent apart from, matters of law.  If,  as  Derrida  argues,  the  idea  of  democracy  is  inherently  multiple,  in  that many democracies are possible  “democracy contains all the different  kinds of constitutions, of regimes or states” [2005, 26] , then fan archives  and communities call for a different notion of democracy than either copy- right owners or copyleft activists. The democracy desired by fan sites would  be  one  that  would  tolerate,  or  even  invite,  what  Lawrence  Liang   2005 ,  citing the Raqs Media Collective, calls “seepage,” that is, the transmutation  of what appears to be a stable, long-standing structure—such as a structure  of law  for instance, copyright  or a structure of culture  for instance, the  state-founded  archive —initiated  by  elements  that  penetrate  them  unex- pectedly, “that ooze through the pores of the outer surfaces into available  pores within the structure, and result in a weakening of the structure itself  …—and this produces an anxiety about the strength and durability of the  structure”  Liang 2005, 14 . For Raqs and Liang, digital networks are rife  with seepage, as these networks facilitate, for “most people,” a “lived expe- rience of day-to-day negotiations with power that renders vacuous any neat  binary of legal illegal”  Liang 2005, 15 , negotiations that take the shape of  “citizens creating their own avenues of participation in the multiple worlds  of media, modernity and globalization [which] demands that we ask funda- mentally different questions of the relationship between law, legality, prop- erty  tangible and intangible  and that which we call the public domain”   Liang 2005, 16 .  Fan archives, and all rogue archives, take many licenses with received  culture,  and  archivists,  archive  users,  and  archive  contributors  perceive  their licentiousness to be proper to the affordances of networks, the exi- gencies of Internet communication, and the social and cultural needs of  humans. They have not sought out permission, nor have they felt much    312   Break 7  need to write new licenses for themselves  though again, they may work in  sympathy and allegiance with those who do . Rather, they have assumed  “the  license  to  play  with  various  possibilities,”  as  Derrida   2005   puts  it,  which “presupposes … a freedom of play, an opening of indetermination  and indecidability in the very concept of democracy, in the interpretation of  the democratic”  25 . Derrida finds this notion of democracy as a concept  in play in Plato’s Republic, in which Plato compares democracy to a “multi-  and brightly colored garment,” as it contains so much diversity  “all sorts of  people, a greater variety than anywhere else” [Derrida 2005, 26] , an image  which calls up “a ‘milieu’ of sexual difference where roués and voyous roam  about” and which also evokes the “curiosity of women and children,” who  love “multicolored beauty,” like “the fanning [la roue] of a peacock”  Derrida  2005, 26 . Derrida states that Plato’s noting of the interest of women and  children in the “multicolored” weave of democracy is “politically signifi- cant,” for in this metaphor Plato weaves into his definition of democracy  those whom some other forms of government disenfranchise, foreground- ing  democracy’s  potential  for  “freedom  and  multicoloredness”  but  also  acknowledging that, if democracy truly is characterized by such diversity,  then it must itself be open to transformation, and have “a changing, vari- able,  whimsical  character,  complicated,  sometimes  obscure,  ambiguous”   Derrida 2005, 26 .  Let us remember that a great many of the people who take license with  copyrighted  cultural  products  are  women  and  children.  As  media  fans,  women and children and queer-identifying people and people of color and  people in the Global South and others who have not always been guaran- teed enfranchisement, politically or culturally, feel drawn to take liberties,  to see what they can do with what they are given. Reading their actions  through Derrida, we might say that their attraction to realizing the poten- tial for multicoloredness and variability in common cultural texts is linked  to a “curiosity” about the potential woven into the very concept of democ- racy for changeability, transformability, recombination.  Rogues of digital culture do not “resist” culture or law. They seep into,  disfigure,  overtake,  and  reform   in  “whimsical,”  “sometimes  ambiguous”  ways   structures  of  culture  and  of  law.  They  do  not  anticipate  how  they  might someday fit into “our neat categories of the liberal public sphere”   Liang 2005, 16 ; that is, they do not hope to see their works incorporated  into  official  texts,  they  do  not  wait  for  authorization  of  their  modes  of  practice  by  official  laws,  and  they  do  not  desire  their  archives  to  merge  into official archives. Instead, they take liberties with the very concept of  democracy, and take steps toward a “democracy to come”  Derrida 2005,    Licensing and Licentiousness   313  25 , which would be a system that recognizes and sustains the “freedom of  play,” “indetermination,” “indecidability,” “diversity,” “multicoloredness,”  “intrinsic plasticity,” and “the curiosity of women and children”  Derrida  2005, 25–26 , that stand at the core of the idea of democracy. A democracy  aligned  with  digital  culture,  in  other  words,  will  remember  its  roots   in  Plato, as read by Derrida , and will honor the memory play—the mutability  of objets trouvés and the preservations of those mutations—beloved by its  rogue constituents.    Conclusion  Fan Data: A Digital Humanities Approach to  Internet Archives C Fan   n  o  o  u  c  s  l  i  n Data  Visualizing Vastness  This  concluding  chapter  seeks  to  answer  a  question  that  readers  of  this  book may have been asking from the very first pages: How big are “rogue”  digital archives?  Here I will present data visualizations that illustrate the size and scale  of Internet fan fiction archives, which make up a major sphere of activity  within the larger trend of amateur digital archiving. I will present original  quantitative  research  that  establishes  the  volume  and  rate  of  fan  fiction  production that transpired on several key fan fiction archives over time. For  all the archives that we analyzed, my research team counted the number of  stories, and some archives allowed us to discern other metrics as well  such  as the number of authors, hits [reads], and reviews .  To  “count”  all  online  rogue   amateur hacker fan pirate volunteer   archives  would  be  impossible:  I  could  never  discover,  let  alone  quantita- tively  analyze,  every  single  amateur fan hacker pirate volunteer  archive  that exists on the Internet. Even to count all fan works archives is not an  achievable goal: there are more fandoms than anyone can practically name,  and more genres of fan production  commentaries, stories, art, and edited  “vids” are only some of the most prominent ones; what about fanmixes and  GIF sets, wallpapers and icons, in-character Twitter feeds and recorded reen- actments of entire films? , posted on more sites, than I will ever even know  about. Even an attempt to count all fan fiction archives would be futile, as  fan writers store their works in an incredibly diverse range of repositories,  including private, password-protected or “friends-locked” blogs and torrent  trackers. Therefore, I set out to count just a handful of fan fiction archives,  selecting  some  of  the  largest,  best-known,  and  most  important  archives  according to volume  it was easy to tell at the outset which archives con- tained the most content  and according to reputation  as derived from our    316   Conclusion  oral history interviews with fifty fans, many of whom named these archives  as central to their fannish experiences .  What I want this conclusion to communicate above all is the quantita- tive significance of the world of Internet fan fiction. The size of fan fiction  archives hints at the vastness of the universe of amateur archives, of which  fan fiction archives make up but one subcategory. When we consider the  largeness  of  these  archives,  we  must  also  speculate  about  the  enormous  number of labor-hours that self-appointed archivists have dedicated to con- structing and operating these sites. Even automated archives  i.e., archives  that enable users to upload their own content, without intervention from  an archivist  require a great deal of back-end maintenance and user sup- port. I have made the case for greater recognition of the invisible work of  rogue archivists; hopefully, that work will come into clearer focus for the  reader via the data visualizations included below.  The Dream of Measuring Fandom  It has long been a dream of media studies scholars to quantify fan activ- ity. John Fiske, whose groundbreaking publications on “active audiences”  in  the  1980s  and  the  first  half  of  the  1990s  laid  the  foundation  for  the  rise  of  fan  studies  in  the  1990s  and  2000s,  “struggled  across  his  writ- ings  to  find  some  evidence  which  might  convince  his  critics  that  popu- lar struggles over meaning were widespread and impactful,” according to  Henry Jenkins  2011c, xxix , who studied under Fiske at the University of  Wisconsin-Madison.  In  Understanding  Popular  Culture,  Fiske   [1989]  2011   expresses dismay that “the products of this tactical consumption”—such as  fan appropriations—“are difficult to study—they have no place, only the  space of their moments of being, they are scattered, dispersed through our  televised, urbanized, bureaucratized experience”  35; also cited in Jenkins  2011c, xxix . Because fan cultures were “operating in the shadows of mass  culture”  in  the  1980s,  Jenkins  states,  it  was  easy  for  Fiske’s  detractors  to  “dismiss such textual poachers as figments of our [fan scholars’] overactive  imaginations”  Jenkins 2011c, xxix–xxx .  But  wholesale  dismissals  of  fan  studies  are  less  likely  today,  Jenkins  writes, as “you can find fans all out in full force on the web. The Internet  has made visible the invisible work of media audiences and the rise of social  networking sites has also helped us to map the ways that such expression is  collective rather than purely personal”  2011c, xxx . And now that we can  see fan productions online—now that they are archived in digital cultural  memory institutions made and maintained by fans—we can finally count    Fan Data   317  them. In counting the numbers of participants and productions that make  up online fan archives, I hope to deliver evidence that audience appropria- tions of mass cultural texts are “widespread and impactful,” and “collective  rather than purely personal”—to show, in other words, that audiences of  mass media are not merely “cultural dopes,” as Stuart Hall  1998  would  say, but often engage in their own meaning-making practices and use com- mercial media as the bases for their own creative productions.  The Fan Data Project  With generous grants from the Hellman Fellows Fund, UC Berkeley’s Com- mittee  on  Research,  and  URAP   Undergraduate  Research  Apprentice  Pro- gram , I developed and managed a project called “Fan Data.” Our mission  was to develop “data scrapers,” or customize scrapers that had been devel- oped for other purposes, that would allow us to count the numbers of stories  and, in some cases, authors and reviews, of a variety of fan fiction archives.  Data scrapers are computer programs that can analyze online information  sets  such as databases  and extract and summarize key data about those  information sets, such as how many users generated how many posts on a  given day or in a given month. Scrapers can perform these “counting” tasks  far more quickly and accurately than a person, or a team of people, can,  given the vastness of the information sets that one finds on the Internet.   For example, a group of people would take days to count all of the posts  made  to  a  popular  social  media  hashtag  over  the  course  of  one  month,  but  a  data  scraper  could  perform  the  task  in  hours.   Data  scrapers  are  a  type of tool that digital humanities scholars can use to accurately assess the  numerical dimensions of the online communities that they wish to study,  in terms of the population of those sites’ participants and the volume of  content they circulate in their shared space.  Fan Data launched in summer 2012 and concluded in summer 2014. The  Fan Data team members in addition to myself, in alphabetical order, were   all are at UC Berkeley unless otherwise noted : Lisa Cronin, Anthropology  major; Vera Cuntz-Leng, a visiting postdoctoral student who received her  PhD in film studies from the Department of Media Studies, Eberhard Karls  University of Tübingen in Germany; Professor Laurent El Ghaoui, electrical  engineering and computer science  EECS ; Andrew Godbehere, PhD candi- date in EECS; Andrea Horbinski, PhD candidate in history; Zhiling Huang,  double major in applied mathematics and EECS; Adam Hutz, PhD candi- date in rhetoric; Renée Pastel, PhD candidate in film and media; Vu Pham,  PhD  candidate  in  EECS;  and  Kelsey  Wong,  double  major  in  English  and    318   Conclusion  molecular  cell  biology.  Crucial  contributions  were  made  by  Molly  Aplet,  and also by Christof Leng at the International Computer Science Institute   ICSI , Berkeley. Undergraduates who contributed to the project as data col- lectors were Sean Huynh, Harry Heng, and Amelia Olson.  In my discussion of fan archives, I will first lay out two sets of case stud- ies. The first set of archives I will examine pertain to one of the most promi- nent and productive online fandoms of the 1990s, the fandom centering  on the sci-fi television series The X-Files  broadcast 1993–2002 . The second  set of archives I will analyze is one of fan fiction based on the Harry Potter  novels by J. K. Rowling  published 1997–2007  and films  released 2001– 2011 . The Harry Potter fandom was one of the definitive Internet fandoms  of the first decade of the 2000s. I am treating The X-Files and Harry Potter  as representative fandoms of their respective decades, the 1990s and 2000s,  and am choosing to delve deeply into these two sets of fan fiction archives,  rather than attempting to mention all of the fandoms that have produced  fan fiction in various archives over the last twenty years, which, as I have  stated, would be impossible.  After examining The X-Files and Harry Potter fan data in detail, I will pres- ent the data extracted from the two major multifandom fan fiction archives  operating today: Fanfiction.net  also called FF.net, founded in 1998 , which  is the largest archive, and the Archive of Our Own  also called AO3, opened  to  the  public  in  2009 ,  which  is  the  fastest-growing  archive.  Analyses  of  production and reception on these two massive archives will hopefully give  the  reader  an  idea  of  the  scale  of  fan  fiction  as  a  contemporary  cultural  phenomenon.  The X-Files: ATXC and Gossamer  The first scraper built by Fan Data consisted of a two-step process, led by  Horbinski.  Horbinski  managed  a  group  of  undergraduate  students  who  culled HTML pages from fan sites, and then Horbinski asked Aplet to write  a Python script that would extract the metadata from the HTML pages and  generate  an  Excel  file  containing  this  metadata.  Within  Excel,  Horbinski  then produced graphs from the metadata. While the Horbinski team ana- lyzed a number of fan sites, here I will include only one of their visualiza- tions, which shows the number of posts made over time to ATXC  alt.x-files. tv.creative , the most popular Usenet newsgroup dedicated to fan fiction  based on The X-Files. ATXC opened in 1994 and was highly active through  the  mid-2000s.  In  2001,  Google  Groups  acquired  Deja  News,  which  had  been archiving Usenet newsgroups since 1995. The first Fan Data scraper    319  Fan Data   180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0  21  165  133  76  Topics on alt.tv.x-files.creative  122  108  106  60  53  Topics  4 9   5   5  5 9   5   5  6 9   5   5  8 9   5   5  9 9   5   5  0 0   5   5  1 0   5   5  2 0   5   5  3 0   5   5  4 0   5   5  5 0   5   5  6 0   5   5  7 0   5   5  8 0   5   5  9 0   5   5  0 1   5   5  1 1   5   5  2 1   5   5  3 1   5   5  Figure 8.1 ATXC  alt.tv.x-files.creative, Usenet newsgroup for fan fiction based on The X-Files :  Posts  topics  per day, 1994–2013.  thus scraped ATXC as it was archived in Google Groups in May 2013, which  was  fortunate  timing,  as  in  June  2013,  a  new  version  of  Google  Groups  was  released  that  made  it  very  difficult,  if  not  impossible,  to  access  all   but the most recent posts to ATXC. Since we were interested in the period  of  ATXC’s  history  with  the  highest  frequency  of  postings,  only  the  data  from  1994  through  2005  interested  us.  The  Horbinski  team  was  able  to  access that data before the Google Groups redesign, and it is visualized in  figure 8.1.  The graph in figure 8.1 shows the number of posts made daily to the  ATXC newsgroup from May 1994  the date of the earliest posts archived  on Google Groups  through May 2013  the time of our scrape . Although  not all of the posts  labeled “Topics” in the graph itself  were fan fiction  stories, we can assume that many of them were either fan fiction stories  or comments and reviews pertaining to X-Files fan fiction in general, or to  individual stories. An additional bit of “noise” in the numbers represented  in the graph is that long fics were customarily divided into several parts, so  that multiple posts sometimes represent one story. Also, one can see that  in the importation of Usenet newsgroups into Google Groups, some posts  were lost; for example, a significant chunk of posts from 1995 to 1996 is  missing  where the daily post count drops to zero for an extended period . Missing data aside, we can observe that from ATXC’s launch in 1994 to  early 1997, the number of daily posts to the newsgroup increased steadily.  An  early  peak  in  the  number  of  daily  posts,  reached  in  the  fall  of  1994,  was 21; in May of 1995, a new peak of 54 was achieved, and in fall 1996,    320   Conclusion  that was topped with a daily post count of 76. Then, sometime in the late  fall early winter of 1996, the daily post count increased by 75 percent, to  133. The highest number of daily posts on ATXC, 165, was achieved in the  first few months of 1997. However, the daily post count still occasionally  climbed above 100 from 1997 through late 2003. If we look at the numeri- cal range that contains the bulk of the postings  the parts of the graph that  are  thickest —the  moving  average  of  posts  per  day—we  can  see  that  the  moving average climbed from about 30 in early 1996 to about 50 in spring  1997, not at the same time that the highest peak of 165 was reached but  just after it, then fell to approximately 20 in late summer or early fall 1997,  and then climbed steadily again until it reached approximately 50 in May  1999. From May 1999 onward, both the peaks and moving averages of daily  posts fell off, with a short and sharp spike of the peak back up to above 100   106  in late 2003.  We could propose a number of hypotheses to explain these numbers. For  example, the peak in early 1997 was likely tied to the fact that The X-Files  was then in the middle of its fourth season, which was one of its most criti- cally acclaimed  lead actress Gillian Anderson won an Emmy, and the show  won the Golden Globe for Best Drama, for that season , and was also the  season when the series jumped from 55th to 11th place in the Nielsen rat- ings  Entertainment Weekly 1998 . We might also hypothesize that many  of the peaks in daily posts correlated with ratings sweeps months  Novem- ber, February, and May , when television programs usually air their most  exciting episodes.  However,  my  primary  interest  in  sharing  these  numbers  with  readers  is to offer some idea of the amount of activity that transpired on a highly  popular online fan fiction community in the 1990s. The ’90s were the first  decade that fan fiction circulated online, and ATXC was among the first  online communities founded for the distribution of fic in a fandom that  did  not  previously  have  print-based  mechanisms  for  publishing  fic   in  other words, while there were Usenet groups for fanfic pertaining to 1960s- era  sci-fi  television  series  such  as  Star  Trek  and  Doctor  Who,  and  some  of  these Usenet fic groups opened earlier than ATXC, Star Trek and Doctor Who  fic both had significant zine traditions that preceded Internet fic publish- ing, whereas fanfic for The X-Files fic was “born digital,” and thus ATXC was  one of the earliest Internet fan fiction communities that was not a transla- tion of, or “next step” for, an offline print-based fic community . Thus, I  consider ATXC to be an exemplary 1990s Internet fanfic group. ATXC was  built to be a discussion group, and as such, it was not quite an archive  sto- ries posted on ATXC were more securely archived on other sites, the largest    Fan Data   321  of which I will discuss below , and it was certainly not the only site that  distributed X-Files fic, but I think most X-Files fans would acknowledge that  ATXC was a major site of fic distribution and discussion in the fandom, and  most media fans who were active in the 1990s would acknowledge that The  X-Files was one of the largest fandoms online in that decade.  Therefore,  from  figure  8.1,  we  can  understand  the  amount  of  activity  that was typical for a thriving online fan community in the 1990s: between  30 and 50 daily posts on average, with the newsgroup collectively produc- ing over 100 posts on its liveliest days. When one considers that the aver- age number of  non-spam  business emails received per day per person in  2011 was 58  Radicati 2011, 3 , and that many people feel overwhelmed by  the “information overload” conveyed by this number of messages  Bilton  2012 , it is interesting that from 1998 through 2000, readers of ATXC had  nearly this many X-Files-related posts per day to read on an average day,  and sometimes had twice or even three times this number to get through.  Of  course,  fandom-related  postings  are  typically  more  pleasurable,  and  therefore easier, to consume than work-related emails. But if 58 business  emails  per  day  per  person  constitutes  a  glut  of  information  in  the  early  2010s, then 30 to 50 X-Files fan posts per day on ATXC in the late 1990s  surely constituted a tidal wave of online entertainment.  The ATXC daily post figures offer us some insight into what the everyday  experience of participating in The X-Files online fandom might have been  like. Let us now look at the cumulative story output of this fandom over  time.  In  the  summer  of  2013,  Professor  El  Ghaoui  and  his  doctoral  student  Godbehere joined the Fan Data project. Godbehere had earlier developed a  tool for the purpose of extracting data from various social media sites, and  at my behest, he refined his scraper so that it could extract data from online  fan fiction database archives. Figure 8.2 is Godbehere’s visualization of his  “master  scrape”  of  the  largest  X-Files  fan  fiction  archive,  called  the  Gos- samer Project, which is widely known among fans simply as “Gossamer.”  Most of the fan fiction posted to ATXC was archived in Gossamer, and  Gossamer  also  archived  stories  posted  to  other  X-Files  electronic  mailing  lists and online communities. Gossamer is an opt-in archive  authors must  give Gossamer explicit permission for every story they write to be added to  the archive , so not every author who posted stories online allowed their  stories  to  be  saved  in  Gossamer;  also,  since  2007,  878  stories  have  been  removed by author request.1 Therefore, Gossamer cannot be said to con- tain every fan fiction story ever written for The X-Files narrative universe.  But  the  fans  that  we  interviewed  who  were  active  on  Usenet  and  other    X-Files Gossamer: cumulative distinct authors and works over time  Number of stories Unique authors  Conclusion  Max stories:  34,246  Max authors:  6,558  322   35,000  30,000  25,000  t n u o C  20,000  15,000  10,000  5,000  0 5 9 9 1  6 9 9 1  7 9 9 1  8 9 9 1  9 9 9 1  0 0 0 2  1 0 0 2  2 0 0 2  3 0 0 2  4 0 0 2  5 0 0 2  6 0 0 2  7 0 0 2  8 0 0 2  9 0 0 2  0 1 0 2  1 1 0 2  2 1 0 2  Date  Figure 8.2 Gossamer: Cumulative X-Files fan fiction stories and authors, 1995–2013.  online spaces in the 1990s shared the opinion that Gossamer is as complete   a  single-fandom  archive  as  was  ever  built.  To  my  knowledge,  Gossamer  is the most comprehensive database archive built for fanfic based on one  source text.  Figure  8.2  shows  that  between  1995   Gossamer’s  opening   and  2013,  34,246 fan stories were archived, written by 6,558 unique authors, for an  average  production  rate  of  5.2  stories  per  author.  This  means  that  if  an  X-Files fan found the Gossamer archive today and set out to read one fan  fiction on Gossamer every day, he or she would require about 94 years to  work through the entire archive.  At  the  same  time,  6,558  fan  authors  seems  minuscule  in  comparison  to the number of people who watched The X-Files: at its peak, during its  fourth  and  fifth  seasons   1996–97  and  1997–98,  respectively ,  the  show  averaged over 19 million viewers per episode  Kavka n.d. . This means that  only approximately 0.03 percent of the show’s maximum number of view- ers made the transition from audience to author. This can perhaps be taken  as an indication of the effort that fiction writing requires—not everyone  who  watches  or  likes  a  source  text  will  take  the  trouble  to  write  stories  about it. Also, the small number of fan authors relative to the number of    Fan Data   323  viewers may underscore the “boutique” nature of fan fiction as a genre of  writing and as a mode of entertainment—most people who enjoy consum- ing mass media do not want to write fanfic about that media, or perhaps do  not know what fanfic is and for this reason, do not opt to participate in fic  writing communities and archives. One question I will raise as we explore  data from later time periods is whether we can detect a change in the over- all awareness of fan fiction as a phenomenon over time, as measured by  the number of people contributing stories to fic archives or the number of  people using fic archives.  At  the  same  time,  based  on  the  stories-per-author  number  of  5.2,  it  seems there is a “stickiness” to the practice of fan fiction writing: once a  fan begins to write fiction, she keeps on doing it. So, while many fans never  undertake  the  writing  of  fan  fiction,  or  at  least,  never  share  their  stories  online, fans who do engage in this form of production appear to enjoy it  enough that many or most of them produce multiple works. Few fans, we  can surmise, write and post fan fiction only once. Learning to write and  post fan fiction, then, might be regarded as a kind of skill acquisition—the  acquisition of “media literacies,” as I discussed in chapter 7—that media  audiences learn: once they know how to create and share stories online in  response to a media text they consume, they continue to respond to the  text in this way. They turn definitively from consumers-only  who might  limit their creative transformations of source texts to their private imagina- tions  into consumer-producers  who exteriorize these transformations in  the form of fan fiction .  As for the number of stories produced by X-Files fans and stored in the  Gossamer archive, however, we must acknowledge that fan authors have  greatly augmented the total story universe, or what I call the meta-archive,  of The X-Files.  Figure 8.3 is an infographic designed by Hutz based on Godbehere’s mas- ter scrape of Gossamer. Between 1993 and 2008, 204 official installments  of X-Files narrative were produced and distributed: 202 television episodes  and  two  films   I  am  not  including  the  three  official  X-Files  video  games  in this count, nor ancillary material such as home media bonus features  extras . As stated earlier, between 1995 and 2013, 34,256 X-Files fan stories  were archived in Gossamer. While 204 installments is not an insignificant  number—at nine full seasons and two feature films, The X-Files is one of  the most robust television-based media franchises ever made—this figure is  dwarfed by the number of fan fiction stories written for the franchise.  What figure 8.3 illustrates is that, in the age of Internet fandom, when  fan fiction is counted as part of an individual storyverse or meta-archive    324   Conclusion  Figure 8.3 X-Files  fan  fiction  stories   total  stories  on  Gossamer ,  1995–2013,  versus  official  X-Files installments  total TV episodes + films , 1993–2008.   the total archive of narratives told about a given a source text , the quan- tity of fan-authored stories will constitute most of the meta-archive, just in  terms of the sheer number of stories told. Because there are far more fans  than  official  producers  telling  and  distributing  stories  at  lower  costs,  the  sum total of fan-made narratives will always swamp the sum total of offi- cial  narratives  in  any  given  meta-archive.  While  the  official  installments  heavily influence the fan-authored stories, as they comprise the “canon”  of a meta-archive, an individual fan fiction reader interested in the X-Files  meta-archive can read up to 168 fan stories for every official X-Files episode  or film she views. Even if a fan reader discounts most of those stories as  not suited to her personal tastes, or poorly written according to her sub- jective  standards,  it  is  readily  conceivable  that,  of  the  total  time  that  an  individual  fan  spends  consuming  narratives  within  a  given  meta-archive  such as The X-Files, she spends a greater percentage of that time reading fan    Fan Data   325  texts rather than viewing official texts. In other words, fan stories can easily  dominate the experiences that fan readers have of a meta-archive in terms  of  time  spent  on  media  consumption  and  quantity  of  media  consumed,  even though the canonical source texts may be often  though not always   more heavily “weighted” by the fan in terms of importance.  I  have  suggested  that  we  can  think  of  each  source  text  as  an  archive  that  expands  each  time  a  reader viewer listener player  of  the  source  text  elaborates  on  the  source,  revises  it,  interprets  it,  or  adapts  it;  this  is  my  theory of archontic production. Each new version of the source is added to  this conceptual meta-archive, enlarging it. Every meta-archive is infinitely  expandable, as all new readers viewers listeners players of a source text can  add their own reworkings, retellings, and extensions to the archive, even  if their archontic productions take place only in their imaginations. I also  suggested  that  Internet  fan  fiction  archives  are  the  nearest  we  can  come  to concrete, perceptible instantiations of these meta-archives. Gossamer, as  the most comprehensive database of X-Files fan fiction in existence, con- taining most of the written fanfic produced for this source text from 1995  to the present, is an excellent example of an online fic archive serving as a  concretization of the conceptual meta-archive that grows and grows each  time an audience member engages with the source text imaginatively.  Of course, Gossamer cannot archive all of the X-Files stories that have  ever been dreamed up by X-Files fans; it houses only the stories that have  been written out as fictional narratives and posted online. But figure 8.3  helps  us  to  visualize  that  every  meta-archive  contains  mostly  nonofficial  narratives. The vast majority of the stories told about a given source text  are not told by the source text’s authors makers, but by its receivers users.  This is true whether or not a source text has a large online fic archive that  can  be  examined,  but  visualizing  the  data  of  a  central  online  fic  archive  such as Gossamer allows us to clearly see that every meta-archive contains  a much greater number of “reader response” versions than official source  productions.  Harry Potter: LiveJournal and Fanfiction.net  If The X-Files fan community was a representative Internet fandom of the  1990s—meaning, a fandom that is often associated with the ’90s because  it began in that decade, was heavily populated, and was highly visible to  online fans  whether or not they were “in” the fandom  at that time—then  the most representative Internet fandom of the 2000s is surely the Harry  Potter fan community. Just as The X-Files series was one of the highest-rated    326   Conclusion  and most critically acclaimed sci-fi media texts of the 1990s, the Harry Pot- ter novels and films were phenomenally popular fantasy texts of the 2000s   although the first three novels appeared in print in the 1990s, the online  fandom  around  Harry  Potter  grew  substantially  with  the  premiere  of  the  first film in 2001, and continued to swell throughout the 2000s . Both The  X-Files and Harry Potter fandoms have generated copious amounts of fan  fiction, particularly in their respective decades.  In  the  summer  of  2013,  Cuntz-Leng  joined  the  Fan  Data  team  and  spearheaded  the  development  of  another  Fan  Data  tool,  one  specifically  designed  to  scrape  LiveJournal   LJ .  Harry  Potter  fan  fiction  was  not  con- centrated in one specific single-fandom database archive, as X-Files fan fic- tion was in Gossamer. At the moment that Harry Potter fan fiction began  to  appear  online  in  significant  quantities,  much  of  it  was  posted  to  the  blogging platform LiveJournal, in communities or “comms” that were dedi- cated to specific Harry Potter fan fiction pairings. Thus, Cuntz-Leng selected  the  five  Harry  Potter  LiveJournal  fanfic  comms  that  contained  the  great- est number of posts and extracted data from each of them. Here is Cuntz- Leng’s description of the scrape:  The data collection of five popular Harry Potter fan fiction communities on LiveJour- nal was done using a Bash shell script that counts the number of postings in each  community in a given timeframe. It uses the LiveJournal web interface to enumerate  all entries and produces a comma-separated text file with the number of posts for  each day. The post-processing, including monthly aggregation, was performed with  Microsoft Excel.  The script counts all postings without distinguishing between actual fan fiction  postings and other messages, e.g., of organizational nature. As the LiveJournal users  can alter the post dates, the data collection only captures the shown dates, which  may or may not be the actual posting dates. Outliers that have obviously been set  to  a  date  before  the  creation  of  the  community  have  been  removed  in  the  post- processing step.  The script only captures public postings. Postings that are only available for mem- bers of the probed communities are not included. This may bias the chronological  distribution in special cases where the community changed the privacy settings over  time. The data was collected on October 14 and October 15, 2013 and captures all  postings till September 30, 2013. Future collection of the same time frame may yield  different results, because postings can be added at an arbitrary date, be deleted, or  moved to a different date.  personal communication with the author   The five LJ communities that, as of mid-October 2013  when Cuntz-Leng  conducted  the  scrape ,  had  the  greatest  number  of  public  postings  were   from  greatest  number  of  posts  to  least :  harrydraco   dedicated  to  stories    Fan Data   327  90   80   70   60   50   40   30   20   10   0  2003   2004   2005   2006   2007   2008   2009   2010   2011   2012   2013   Figure 8.4 Five Harry Potter fan fiction communities on LiveJournal: Posts per day, 2003–2013.  about the characters Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy , remusxsirius  Remus  Lupin Sirius Black stories , harry-draco  another comm for Harry Draco sto- ries , hp_fanfiction  a general comm for Harry Potter fics , and snape_potter   Professor Severus Snape Harry Potter stories .  Figure 8.4 shows the aggregate number of posts made daily to the five  LJ comms between 2003 and 2013. It is an analogue to figure 8.1, which  showed the number of posts made daily to the major X-Files community,  ATXC. Like ATXC, the posts on the LJ comms are not exclusively fan fiction  stories;  members  of  LJ  fan  fiction  communities  often  post  links  to  inter- views with members of casts and production staffs, icons and wallpapers,  reviews and commentary, and other types of material related to the fandom   these materials often serve to inspire or inform the comm members’ fan  fiction production . However, fan fiction is a primary focus of these five LJ  comms, as it was on ATXC.  It is striking that ATXC achieved higher peak numbers of daily postings  in the 1990s than did the combination of five of the most productive Harry  Potter LJs in the 2000s. Before seeing the data, I hypothesized that the most  heavily trafficked Harry Potter LJ comms would beat ATXC for peak daily  activity. Internet fandom was very new in the 1990s, when ATXC was most  active, and I thought that fans in the 2000s would simply be more accus- tomed  to  participating  in  online  comms  and  would  therefore  post  more    328   Conclusion  content than 1990s online fans. However, the five LJ comms we analyzed  had peaks in aggregated daily post numbers ranging from the mid-teens to  the mid-40s during their most active years  2005 to 2008 , not greater than  ATXC’s 30 to 50 average daily posts in that community’s years of peak par- ticipation. The LJs did see higher post numbers on some days, reaching the  mid-50s or low-60s, but ATXC’s highest-post days saw more than 100 mes- sages circulated. On the Harry Potter LJ comms, the highest number of total  daily posts reached was 79 in late summer or early fall of 2005  perhaps  driven by the publication of the sixth novel, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood  Prince, and anticipation surrounding the premiere of the fourth film, Harry  Potter and the Goblet of Fire, in November 2005 . The moving average  the  thickest part of the daily activity graph  was between 25 and 35 posts per  day from 2005 through 2008, at which point it began to drop to around  20, then below, though the moving average spiked to around 30 in 2009,  perhaps coinciding with the release of the film version of Harry Potter and  the Half-Blood Prince that July.  That the daily average of the five combined Harry Potter LJs in the 2000s  does not match the daily average of postings to ATXC in the 1990s is likely  attributable to the shift from centralization to diffusion that took place in  online fandom around the turn of the twenty-first century. In the 1990s,  the first full decade of Internet fandom, Usenet newsgroups  such as ATXC ,  mailing lists, and custom-built database archives like Gossamer were sites  for posting fan fiction for all characters and pairings in a fandom  so, Gos- samer  archives  stories  written  about  the  show’s  main  characters,  Mulder  and Scully, but it also archives every other pairing that X-Files fan authors  wrote  about .  At  the  start  of  the  2000s,  as  social  media  platforms  multi- plied, offering fans without deep technical skills the tools to launch their  own fan websites and communities, online fandom splintered. Many fan  fiction communities organized around specific pairings; sites where all of  the fan fiction written for a given source text could be found became rare.  Thus, when I look at the combination of the daily posts on the five Harry  Potter LJ comms in figure 8.4, I think that we would have had to combine  the daily posts from many more than five LJs—perhaps as many as the top  70 Harry Potter LJ fanfic comms—to get a true sense of the daily activity of  what we might call the “Harry Potter fan fiction community on LJ” in the  largest sense.  However, when Cuntz-Leng and I examined the total numbers of posts  for  the  top  70  Harry  Potter  LJ  comms,  there  was  a  significant  drop-off  between the fifth and sixth most voluminous comms  a difference of over  2,600  total  postings ,  and  we  decided  to  limit  the  scrape  to  the  top  five    Fan Data   700,000  600,000  500,000  400,000  300,000  200,000  100,000  t n u o C  329  Harry Potter on FF.net: cumulative distinct authors and works over time  Number of stories Unique authors  Max stories: 631,075  Max authors: 217,292  0 0 0 0 2  1 0 0 2  2 0 0 2  3 0 0 2  4 0 0 2  5 0 0 2  6 0 0 2  7 0 0 2  8 0 0 2  9 0 0 2  0 1 0 2  1 1 0 2  2 1 0 2  3 1 0 2  Date  Figure 8.5 Fanfiction.net: Cumulative Harry Potter fan fiction stories and authors, 2001–2013.  comms.  Perhaps  we  will  execute  a  more  comprehensive  scrape  at  a  later  date. In any case, the fact that the five most active public Harry Potter LJs  could not match the activity of ATXC is itself interesting, in that it shows  that  no  single  Harry  Potter  LJ  could  even  come  close  to  the  single  most  popular  fan  fiction  site  for  The  X-Files—such  was  the  difference  between  centralized and comprehensive fan fiction sites of the 1990s and diffuse,  pairing-specific fan fiction sites of the 2000s.  However,  when  we  examine  the  total  number  of  Harry  Potter  stories  stored in the largest multifandom database archive, Fanfiction.net  FF.net ,  we  see  a  significant  difference  between  this  number  and  the  number  of  total X-Files fan fiction stories archived in Gossamer.  Figure 8.5 is a visualization of the data extracted from the Harry Potter  category of FF.net. The extraction was performed with Godbehere’s scraper,  and the visualization was rendered by Godbehere and Pham. In figure 8.5,  we  see  that  the  total  number  of  Harry  Potter  stories  housed  in  the  FF.net  archive   631,075   is  approximately  18  times  the  total  number  of  X-Files  stories housed in the Gossamer archive. Also, the number of unique authors    330   Conclusion  who  posted  Harry  Potter  stories  to  FF.net   217,292   is  33  times  the  num- ber of unique authors found on Gossamer. This shows that, while the top  five Harry Potter LiveJournal communities show less daily activity than the  X-Files ATXC community, the overall fiction production of the Harry Pot- ter  fandom  was  much  greater  than  that  of  the  X-Files  fandom.  Above,  I  attributed the lower levels of daily activity on the Harry Potter LJ comms  to the fact that Harry Potter fan fiction activity was spread out over many  individual fic comms, most of which were devoted to particular pairings.  But figure 8.5 shows that when the fic production of  Harry Potter fans is  aggregated,  inclusive  of  all  characters  and  pairings,  that  the  preeminent  fandom of the 2000s generated more fan fiction than one of the preemi- nent fandoms of the 1990s. This is borne out by the fact that the four next  most productive fandoms on FF.net after Harry Potter each show more sto- ries than the 34K stories housed in Gossamer: Twilight  214K , Lord of the  Rings  50.1K , Percy  Jackson  and  the  Olympians  46.1K , and Hunger  Games   34.8K  are all media franchises that, like Harry Potter, comprise novels and  big-budget Hollywood film series, and also like Harry Potter, all of the film  versions were released in the 2000s and 2010s.  Internet fan fiction production increased substantially from the 1990s to  the 2000s. This is perhaps the result of the media industries getting increas- ingly savvy about building successful multi-installment film franchises out  of bestselling novels, but it may also be the result of the fact that online  fandom has simply become a more popular pastime overall, as the Internet  has  attracted  more  users  and  become  a  more  common  site  of  entertain- ment and recreation. The number of US households with Internet access  increased from 18 percent in 1997  the first year that the Census Bureau  asked about Internet use, and the year when ATXC daily activity reached  its highest peak  to 50.4 percent in 2001  when the first Harry Potter film  opened  to 74.8 percent in 2012  Census Bureau 2014 . As Internet use has  grown, so have Internet fan fiction archives; fandom is obviously a compel- ling activity, and fan fiction writing an engaging form of digital participa- tion and production, for network users.  I stated that it would take an X-Files fan 94 years to read all of the stories  in the Gossamer archive, if she read one story per day. In comparison, it  would take a Harry Potter fan 1,729 years to get through all of the Harry Potter  stories on FF.net at a rate of one story per day. However, there is one metric  in which the 1990s X-Files fan fiction authors top the 2000s Harry Potter fan  fiction authors: the number of stories per author  5.2 stories author on Gos- samer versus 2.9 stories author in the Harry Potter section of FF.net . I am  uncertain about what might have caused this gap in productivity,2 but one    Fan Data   331  possible explanation is that the X-Files in the 1990s may have been a more  “cult” fandom than Harry Potter in the 2000s, if we define “cult” by some  subjective  notion  of  commitment  or  dedication—“cult”  fans  being  more  “hard-core,” more deeply involved in their fan communities, than “casual”  fans. It may be that fan fiction was, at the start of online fandom, an activ- ity that only hard-core fans engaged in, but that as the 2000s progressed,  fanfic writing became a form of online participation and, as I argued earlier,  a type of media literacy that grew common enough among Internet users  that casual fans practiced it alongside very dedicated cult fans.  However, with the average stories-per-author in the Harry Potter FF.net  archive being close to three, fan fiction writing appears only slightly less  the domain of “hard-core” fans in the 2000s than in the 1990s. Most fans  who wrote and posted  Harry  Potter revisions and extensions did so more  than once. Thus, “casual” may be the wrong descriptor for Harry Potter fan  fiction writers—their repeated acts of fiction production show that these  fans were quite immersed in their fandom, just perhaps not to the degree  that X-Files fan fiction authors were committed to theirs. This hypothesis  suggests that there is a spectrum of fan engagement, with not too great a  distance separating Harry Potter fan fiction writers from X-Files fan fiction  writers.  Harry Potter on FF.net: reviews over time  Max: 20,253,133  20,000,000  15,000,000  t n u o C  10,000,000  5,000,000  0 0 0 0 2  1 0 0 2  2 0 0 2  3 0 0 2  4 0 0 2  5 0 0 2  6 0 0 2  7 0 0 2  8 0 0 2  9 0 0 2  0 1 0 2  1 1 0 2  2 1 0 2  3 1 0 2  Date  Figure 8.6 Fanfiction.net: Cumulative Harry Potter fan fiction reviews, 2001–2013.   332   Conclusion  Like figure 8.5, figure 8.6 was rendered by Godbehere and Pham based on  a scrape of FF.net’s Harry Potter subarchive. Figure 8.6 shows that, between  2000 and 2013, over 20.2 million reviews were posted in response to Harry  Potter  fan  fiction  stories  on  FF.net.  On  average,  there  are  32  reviews  per  Harry Potter story, and 93 reviews per unique author, on the archive.  Gossa- mer does not have a feedback or review feature, so we could not determine  how many reviews were done per story on that archive.  While we cannot  tell how many unique users the number of reviews represents  and since  many Harry Potter stories on FF.net consist of multiple chapters, it is likely  that the same readers left multiple reviews—one per chapter—on many sto- ries . Nevertheless, I think it is fair to assume that many more people have  read and reviewed Harry Potter fics than have written Harry Potter fics on  FF.net. On the spectrum of fan engagement that I just proposed, we might  think of reading fics as a practice located at the lower end of the spectrum,  and writing fics being located at the higher end of the spectrum. As there  are  evidently  far  more  readers reviewers  than  writers,  we  might  presume  that writing fics takes more effort than reading and reviewing them. “Lurk- ers,” or readers of fanfic who do not post reviews for what they read, would  then be lower on the engagement spectrum than reviewers.  However, I also think that the terms I have been using to differentiate  between kinds of fans—lurkers, reviewers, “casual” fan authors who write  2.9 stories each on average, and “cult” fan authors who write 5.2 stories on  average—do not necessarily correspond to fans’ levels of commitment or  dedication to their fandoms. After all, we can easily imagine a lurker feeling  as passionately about a fandom as a very prolific fan writer. The difference,  then, is likely not the degree to which a fan feels immersed in her or his fan- dom, but the degree to which a fan feels comfortable exteriorizing—making  public—her or his interior acts of archontic production. I thus revise my  earlier  proposal  of  a  spectrum  of  fan  engagement  and  now  suggest  that  there  is  a  spectrum  of  fan  performativity.  Some  fans  feel  uncomfortable  “performing” online in the “global theater” sense that I discussed in Break  0; by performing online, I mean any type of online communication, rang- ing from leaving a review on a fan fiction story to writing and posting a  fan fiction story, or multiple stories, to running a fan fiction archive. Using  this rubric, we might say that more people are willing to perform online by  reviewing a fic than by writing a fic. This would explain the great discrep- ancy between the number of reviews and the number of stories authors on  the FF.net Harry Potter subarchive as well as a notion that fan engagement  differs between reviewers and writers.   Fan Data   333  One final note about figure 8.6: 20.2 million reviews represents a sig- nificant amount of attention being paid to Harry Potter fan fiction. If 20.2  million viewers tuned in to a television show, that show would place sec- ond in the primetime broadcast ratings, coming in just after Sunday Night  Football and ahead of all fiction and nonfiction television series, accord- ing to the most recent weekly Nielsen ratings available to me at the time  of this writing  Bibel 2013 . Of course, Sunday Night Football draws more  than 20 million viewers on a single night, and the 20.2 million reviews on  the FF.net Harry Potter subarchive accumulated over more than ten years.  Nevertheless, figures 8.5 and 8.6 illustrates that fan fiction is not as “niche”  or “boutique” a form of cultural production as it was in the 1990s. Fan fic- tion is rapidly approaching a size—in volume of stories and in quantity of  users—that one might say is worthy of the title “mass,” as in, “a genre of  mass media production.” This raises the question of what exactly consti- tutes “mass media” in terms of user-generated online content. How many  stories, and how many readers reviewers, would make fan fiction a form of  crowdsourced, bottom-up, largely unmanaged, mass media?  Figure  8.7  is  an  infographic  designed  by  Hutz  based  on  Godbehere’s  scrape of the Harry Potter subarchives on Fanfiction.net and Archive of Our  Own. Figure 8.7 offers another measure of the world of Harry Potter fan fic- tion: a comparison of the number of words contained in all of the Harry  Potter fan stories on both archives to the number of words contained in all  of Rowling’s Harry Potter novels. Many fans of the Harry Potter books would  say that they are among the longest books they have read, but as figure 8.7  illustrates, the total of all of the novels’ words is minuscule compared to the  total of words authored by fans based on those books and their film adapta- tions. Just as we saw in the case of The X-Files in figure 8.3, the meta-archive  of Harry Potter is absolutely dominated by fan texts, not by the source texts,  even when the source texts are voluminous in their own right.  Fanfiction.net and Archive of Our Own: Master Scrapes  I  will  now  turn  from  examining  fan  fiction  production  and  reception  within individual fandoms to examining the entirety of two multifandom  database archives FF.net and AO3. FF.net and AO3 are currently the most  significant  fanfic  archives  in  operation,  as  FF.net  is  the  largest  and  AO3  is the fastest-growing. Following are the results of the “master scrapes” of   both FF.net and AO3, executed by Godbehere. Here are Godbehere’s descrip- tions of his data collection processes  although in the following sections,    334   Conclusion  Figure 8.7 Fanfiction.net  and  Archive  of  Our  Own:  Words  in  Harry  Potter  fan  fiction  stories,  2000–2013, versus cumulative words in Harry Potter novels.  I  discuss  FF.net,  the  older  archive,  before  AO3,  Godbehere  scraped  AO3  before FF.net, and so AO3 precedes FF.net in his descriptions :  Archive of Our Own “Master Scrape”:  Data collection began on July 29, 2013 and ended on August 2, 2013. The archive is  constructed hierarchically, listing fandom types  such as Anime & Manga, Movies,  TV Shows  at the highest level. In each fandom type, there is a list of fandoms  Harry  Potter, Marvel, etc. . These two categories serve as tags for works. Within each fan- dom, there is a list of works on which our data collection software iterated.  Note— Works may appear in multiple fandoms. This led to over-counting. Currently trying  to resolve these duplicate entries in database for the correct counts. This error only  applies to the master count, not the individual fandom counts.    Fan Data   335  Technical—Data collection  or “scraping”  was performed with Python 2.7. The   library urllib2 was used to load individual web pages and gather the page html:  html = urllib2.urlopen url .read   Data is stored in an SQLite database. A table in the database saves the following   information on each work:     title    author  user name           date  Date when published     summary  user-provided summary of the content   fandom type fandom  Dates are represented as Unix timestamps, which count the number of seconds since  the Epoch  Jan 01 1970 00:00 UTC . As of this writing, the Unix time is approxi- mately 1377969792, indicating that nearly 1.4 billion seconds have elapsed since the  epoch. Times before Jan 01 1970 are represented as negative numbers. FanFiction.net “Master Scrape”: Data  collection  began  on  August  14,  2013  and  ended  on  August  22,  2013.  Tech- nical—Fanfiction.net  uses  javascript  to  dynamically  generate  its  web  pages.  This  means that urllib2 is unable to correctly grab the HTML representation of the page.  A more sophisticated means of data collection was required, with our Python 2.7  script needing to simulate a complete web browser. To this end, we used QtWebKit  from PyQt4.  personal communication with the author   Figure 8.8 is a visualization by Godbehere of the data he extracted from  FF.net. In this graph, we can see that the rate of production of fan fiction  has  increased  steadily  from  FF.net’s  opening  in  1998  to  the  present.  As  active as Harry Potter fan authors were throughout the 2000s, through the  release of the final film  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2  in 2011,  Harry Potter has obviously not been the only driver of fan fiction writing on  FF.net; while there have been periodic dips, monthly production has grown  overall. As of this scrape, which was done in the late summer of 2013, fan  authors are now contributing over 80,000 new stories every month to the  FF.net  archive.  The  climbing  rate  of  monthly  production  of  fan  authors  indicates that fan fiction production did not cease or slow with the end of  the Harry Potter franchise; as large a role as those books and movies played  in fan fiction output throughout the 2000s, fan fiction has continued to  thrive as a “media industry” after Harry Potter.  Let us recall that, on ATXC in the late 1990s, the high moving average  was 50 daily posts, and the peak daily post count sometimes reached over  100; on the top five most active Harry Potter LJs in the 2000s, the high mov- ing average was 35 daily posts, and the peak daily post count sometimes    Conclusion  Number of new stories per month on FF.net  336   90,000  80,000  70,000  60,000  50,000  40,000  30,000  20,000  10,000  t n u o C  0 8 9 9 1  9 9 9 1  0 0 0 2  1 0 0 2  2 0 0 2  3 0 0 2  4 0 0 2  5 0 0 2  6 0 0 2  7 0 0 2  8 0 0 2  9 0 0 2  0 1 0 2  1 1 0 2  2 1 0 2  3 1 0 2  Date  Figure 8.8 Fanfiction.net: Stories posted per month  8,101 fandoms , 1999–2013.   Fan Data   337  reached over 60. This means that, within a single fandom, in a thirty-day  month of average-to-high production, a fan reader might have encountered  between  1,050  and  3,000  new  posts  per  month  in  the  1990s  and  2000s.  But combining all of the fandoms on FF.net, we get a much different sense  of the rate of fan fiction production over the past fifteen years: figure 8.8  shows us that by 2010, fan authors were posting approximately 50,000 new  stories per month, and that only three years later, fan authors were post- ing 60 percent more new stories per month than the 2010 figures.  Let us  also keep in mind that not all of the posts on ATXC and the Harry Potter LJs  contained fan fiction stories, as I explained above; however, all of the posts  to FF.net are fan fiction stories.  Eighty thousand new narratives per month  is an incredible rate of content generation. By contrast, at the time of this  writing, only 251 new episodes of scripted television  inclusive of reality  and fiction shows on broadcast, basic cable, and premium cable networks   air every week, meaning that 1,004 new episodes air in a month  Locate TV  2013 . On FF.net, fan authors are currently publishing nearly 80 times that  quantity of fresh content monthly.   Max  Horkheimer  and  Theodor  Adorno  proposed  in  their  1944  essay  “The Culture Industry” that the technologies of cinema and radio exem- plified  “the  rationality  of  domination”   2002,  95 ,  exposing  all  audience  members “in authoritarian fashion to the same programs put out by dif- ferent  stations”   95–96 ,  and  thereby  subjecting  them  to  a  set  of  unified  ideologies,  ideologies  informed  by  and  serving  corporate  interests.  What  if Horkheimer and Adorno could see that media audience members in the  2010s are not meekly consuming the narrow range of programming offered  up by broadcast and cable TV, but are generating their own responses to,  and revisions of, mass media content, in quantities that dwarf the num- ber of cultural productions issued by media corporations? As I mentioned  above, it would be an easy matter for an individual in the United States  today to consume far more fan fiction stories, or fan productions remixes  in general, than episodes of television in any given week. Horkheimer and  Adorno would likely say that it is difficult to ascertain whether a person  who watches and reads more fan-made than corporate-made content sub- scribes to a different set of ideologies than one who consumes only what  is  put  out  by  “the  culture  industry”—they  might  be  quite  skeptical  that  media fans can escape the “domination” of the industry’s logics and beliefs   though I have argued in the chapters of this book that many fans produce  counterhegemonic narratives and discourses . But Horkheimer and Adorno  argued  that  many-to-many  technologies   Poster  2012 ,  such  as  the  tele- phone, facilitate a very different type of use, and giving rise to a different    338   Conclusion  type of user, than one-way technologies, such as film and broadcast radio— they write that the telephone “liberally permitted the participant to play  the  role  of  subject”  while  broadcast  radio  “makes  everyone  equally  into  listeners”  95 —and they might acknowledge that the Internet, as a many- to-many technology, enables participants to be “subjects” makers of media  and not merely “listeners” receivers of media.   Might  we  one  day  be  able  to  quantitatively  measure  something  like  “degrees  of  absorption”  and  “time  spent  on  consumption”  between  dif- ferent official and user-generated content types? Any such measure would  be  confused  by  the  increasing  amount  of  time  people  spend  simultane- ously engaging with multiple media platforms, for example, participating  in a social media site while watching television or home media. One might  also  have  to  differentiate  between  long-form  user-generated  genres,  such  as novel-length fan fiction stories, and short-form user-made texts, such as  140-character tweets and six-second Vines.  A quantitative comparison of fan fiction production to television or film  production may be an unfair one, as the barriers to entry and the costs of  production are far higher in media production than in fan fiction writing.  Let us then turn to book publishing, which is perhaps a more comparable  media industry to fan fiction: according to the most recent data available  from Bowker, the number of fiction books published  by US publishers  in  2011 was 43,016  Bowker, “New Books Titles and Editions, 2002–2012” ,  and the number of total books  in every genre  self-published by authors,  in either print or ebook format, in 2012 in the United States was 391,768   Bowker 2013 . If the number of stories published monthly on FF.net were  to stay steady at 80,000 for a twelve-month period, FF.net would see a rate  of  publication  of  960,000  fiction  stories  per  year,  which  would  be  more  than 22 times the number of fiction books issued by US publishers in 2011,  and 2.4 times the number of books in all genres and formats self-published  in the United States in 2012. But the rate of story production remaining  steady of FF.net seems extremely unlikely, as this rate has, for the most part,  only risen since the archive’s founding.  Figures 8.9 and 8.10 were rendered by Godbehere and Huang based on  Godbehere’s data collection. Figure 8.9 shows that, as of the summer 2013  scrape,  approximately  5.4  million  stories  in  8,101  fandoms,  by  1.2  mil- lion authors, have been archived in FF.net, for an average of 4.5 stories per  author  closer to the 5.2 stories author we saw in The X-Files fandom on  Gossamer than to the 2.9 stories author we saw in the Harry Potter fandom  on FF.net . Figure 8.10 shows that 139.5 million reviews have been left, an  average of 25.6 reviews per story and 115.4 reviews per unique author.   6,000,000  5,000,000  4,000,000  t n u o C  3,000,000  2,000,000  1,000,000  Fan Data   339  Harry Potter on FF.net:  cumulative distinct authors and works over time  Number of stories  Unique authors  Max stories:  5,441,011  Max authors: 1,209,207  0 9 9 9 1  0 0 0 2  1 0 0 2  2 0 0 2  3 0 0 2  4 0 0 2  5 0 0 2  6 0 0 2  7 0 0 2 Date  8 0 0 2  9 0 0 2  0 1 0 2  1 1 0 2  2 1 0 2  3 1 0 2  Figure 8.9 Fanfiction.net: Cumulative stories and authors  8,101 fandoms , 1999–2013.  At  5.4  million,  FF.net’s  number  of  stories  dwarfs  Netflix’s  library  of  60,000 television episodes and movies available for streaming  Levy 2013   and Project Gutenberg’s 100,000 free ebooks  including the Project’s affili- ates  and  partners    https:  www.gutenberg.org  .

It falls far short of print- media and tangible-object collections such as the Smithsonian’s repository  of 137 million artifacts  Smithsonian, “Smithsonian Collections” , and the  Library of Congress’ total of over 158 million items  Library of Congress,    FF.net: reviews over time  Conclusion  Max:  139,492,054  340   140,000,000  120,000,000  100,000,000  80,000,000  t n u o C  60,000,000  40,000,000  20,000,000  0 9 9 9 1  0 0 0 2  1 0 0 2  2 0 0 2  3 0 0 2  4 0 0 2  5 0 0 2  6 0 0 2  8 0 0 2  9 0 0 2  0 1 0 2  1 1 0 2  2 1 0 2  3 1 0 2  7 0 0 2 Date  Figure 8.10 Fanfiction.net: Number of reviews  8,101 fandoms , 1999–2013.  “General  Information:  Year  2013  at  a  Glance” .  So,  when  we  compare  the FF.net “library” to the largest print and artifact libraries in the United  States,  FF.net  seems  small,  but  when  we  compare  FF.net  to  digital  librar- ies  and  collections,  it  seems  equivalent  in  volume  to  some  of  the  larger  repositories.  I  am  opting  to  compare  FF.net  to  Netflix’s  streaming  library,  Project  Gutenberg, the Internet Archive’s Digital Books Collection, and the Pirate  Bay because these are all digital archives from which a user can access com- plete content files—an entire fan fiction story, an entire book, or an entire  movie or television episode—rather than content listings or content “pre- views”  parts of a book or audiovisual text . Thus, while many larger digital    Fan Data   341  archives permit users limited access to content, like Google Books, or access  to content catalogs, like many online library catalogs, I think that only full- access digital archives, such as those just listed, are comparable to online  fan fiction archives. It is interesting to note that, barring Netflix, the full- access digital archives have a distinctive relationship to copyright law in  each instance: Project Gutenberg and the Internet Archive’s Digital Books  Collections offer unrestricted access to texts that are in the public domain;  both the Pirate Bay and FF.net violate copyright as it has been historically  understood, as the Pirate Bay facilitates the networked exchange of media  files that are primarily digitizations  “rips” or “scans”  of Blu-rays, DVDs,  printed books, and other hard-copy media that are traditionally sold com- mercially; and FF.net’s authors appropriate copyrighted materials  that is,  materials found in copyrighted print and audiovisual texts  such as names  of characters and settings, plots, some dialogue, and so on. Netflix offers  access to copyrighted material under a paid subscription model that has,  so  far,  been  successful,  but  Netflix’s  model  has  not  gone  unchallenged  by copyright holders  for example, numerous film studios and television  networks  have  ended  their  content  licensing  deals  with  Netflix,  either  because they wished to launch rival subscription services [Scoblete 2013] or  because they decided that Netflix was not paying a high enough price for  the licenses [Emerson 2012] ; Netflix has lost thousands of titles because of  these conflicts.  So,  one  way  we  can  view  fan  fiction  archives,  and  in  fact,  all  rogue  archives,  is  as  part  of  a  specific  breed  of  online  distribution  service—the  full-access,  unrestricted   or  nearly  so   digital  archive—and  to  note  that  many of these full-access archives are viewed as potential threats or ene- mies  by  industries  protected  by  nondigital  copyright  norms.  Fan  fiction  authors and archives have been the targets of legal action over the course  of fan fiction’s history, but not nearly as much as the Pirate Bay and other  file-sharing sites. The point I wish to make with regard to FF.net is that it  is remarkable that this fan fiction archive has been allowed to grow to its  present  size.  FF.net  is  neither  a  repository  of  public  domain  content  nor  of  Creative  Commons–licensed  content,  nor  does  it  pay  for  licenses  for  the  content  its  authors  appropriate.  In  many  respects,  it  is  closer  to  the  Pirate Bay than to any of the other full-access digital archives, because it  makes  free  use   in  every  possible  sense   of  copyrighted  media,  but  prob- ably because fan fiction is a transformative use of copyrighted media rather  than a strict replication of that media, FF.net has been allowed to operate   so far  relatively unhindered, while the Pirate Bay has been the defendant  in a number of high-profile legal disputes. That the two sites are of similar    342   Conclusion  size but have received very different treatment by the legal representatives  of copyright holders in the US media industries shows that, to some extent,  media copyright holders consider fan fiction production to be “fair use,”  while they consider media piracy to be illegal infringement.  The question  of what percentage of fans are actually media pirates—that is, how many  people participate in both transformative and replicative appropriations of  copyrighted media—remains open.   Fanfiction.net is by far the largest online fan fiction archive operating.  At a rate of one story per day, it would take a fan 94 years to read all of the  X-Files stories on Gossamer, 1,729 years to read all of the Harry Potter sto- ries on FF.net, and 14,907 years to read all of the stories, in all 8,000+ fan- doms, on FF.net. The number of unique authors who have contributed to  FF.net  1.2 million  is 9.3 times the number of writers and authors who were  employed in the United States in 2012  129,100, according to the Bureau of  Labor Statistics [2014] . The number of reviews posted to stories on FF.net   139.5 million  over the past fifteen years is greater than the number of peo- ple who bought tickets to sporting events in the United States and Canada,  inclusive of all games played in the National Football League, National Bas- ketball Association, Major League Baseball, and National Hockey League,  in  2012   131  million    Motion  Picture  Association  of  America  2012,  10 .  In my view, there is no question that FF.net is on the path to becoming a  major content distributor, attracting significant quantities of makers and  audiences.  The  FF.net  data  show  that  fan  fiction  is  not  a  trend  of  media  production and consumption that is slowing or shrinking. In regard to fig- ure 8.8, I stated that the past three years show a 60 percent growth in the  rate of fan fiction production. This is a rate that no other traditional media  industry or entertainment genre can match: the number of films released  in 2012 was only 21.5 percent higher than the number of films released in  2009  Motion Picture Association of America 2012, 20 , and the number of  fiction books published in 2011 was 19 percent lower than in 2008  Bowker,  “New Books Titles and Editions” . One new media industry, self-publishing  in print and in ebook formats, is outpacing the increase in the rate of fan  fiction production: 252 percent more texts were self-published in 2012 than  in 2009  Bowker 2013, 1 . Fan fiction is a form of self-publishing, so per- haps one conclusion we can draw from these data is that self-publishing  in all genres, including media fans’ self-publishing their fiction works digi- tally, is an industry on the rise.  In any case, I argue that at 5.4 million archived works—90 times as many  works as are housed in Netflix’s streaming library—with 80,000 new works  currently being added every month, FF.net can be considered a mass media    Number of new stories per month on AO3  Works per month AO3 open beta AO3 launch FF.net purge  343  Max: 42,295  Fan Data   45,000  40,000  35,000  30,000  t n u o C  25,000  20,000  15,000  10,000  5,000  0  3 0 0 2  4 0 0 2  5 0 0 2  6 0 0 2  7 0 0 2  8 0 0 2  9 0 0 2  Date  0 1 0 2  1 1 0 2  2 1 0 2  3 1 0 2  Figure 8.11 Archive of Our Own: Stories posted per month  12,023 fandoms , 2008–2013.  channel.  The  FF.net  data  show  that  fan  fiction  is  a  fast-growing  type  of  media content production and distribution, and that it is attracting signifi- cant numbers of consumers. If one could invest in the “stock” of FF.net—if  one could bet on whether the site will see continuing growth in its numbers  of works, authors, and consumers—it would be a relatively safe investment. However, while FF.net is unquestionably the largest fan fiction archive,  it is not the only major archive, it is not the fastest-growing archive, and it  is not a well-liked archive by many fans. An alternative archive, to which  many fan authors and readers have flocked in recent years, is the Archive  of Our Own, or AO3.  Figures 8.11 and 8.12 are visualizations by Godbehere based on his mas- ter scrape of AO3. AO3 was launched in closed beta on October 3, 2008   during closed beta, only a limited number of people were allowed to create  accounts and upload works , and then entered open beta on November 14,  2009, and is still in open beta today  newcomers may register for accounts  on  the  archiveofourown.org  website,  and  once  they  have  accounts,  they  may upload works . AO3 allows users to assign any dates they wish to the  works that they upload, hence some of the stories have dates that precede    344   109  108  107  106  105  104  103  102  101  100  l  a t o T  Cumulative totals of fan activity in AO3  Conclusion  Max hits: 668,112,232  Max kudos: 21,082,528  Max bookmarks: 3,569,258 Max works: 780,922  Max authors: 68,675  Works Authors Hits  Bookmarks Kudos AO3 open beta  AO3 Launch FF.net Purge  9 9 9 1  0 0 0 2  1 0 0 2  2 0 0 2  3 0 0 2  4 0 0 2  5 0 0 2  8 0 0 2  9 0 0 2  0 1 0 2  1 1 0 2  2 1 0 2  3 1 0 2  6 0 0 2  7 0 0 2  Date  Figure 8.12 Archive  of  Our  Own:  Cumulative  authors,  stories,  bookmarks,  kudos,  and  hits   12,023 fandoms , 2008–2013.  the 2008 closed beta launch of the archive  and figures 8.11 and 8.12 show  these predated stories—all numbers prior to the “AO3 Launch” marker in  2008—these are likely stories that fans wrote earlier than 2008, but posted  to AO3 after the 2008 launch . But figures 8.11 and 8.12 clearly show that  open beta was the archive’s true launch. And, in figure 8.11, looking at the  rate of new works added per month following the November 2009 open  beta, we can see that there was a large uploading push as soon as users could  get accounts, and then a decrease in the rate of uploading in early 2010,  then an increase starting at the beginning of 2011, and then sharp climbs  in  the  rate  of  uploading  continuing  to  mid-2013,  when  the  rate  of  new  works added per month is 42,295.  We can also see that several surges in this rate took place after the FF.net  “purge”  of  June  2012:  on  AO3,  the  rate  of  new  works  added  went  from  18,000 per month in spring 2012 to over 20,000 right after the purge, then  rose above 30,000 at the end of 2012, spiked to about 35,000 right at the  beginning of 2013, and, after a dip back down to 30,000 in spring 2013,  has climbed steadily to its current peak of over 40,000. The FF.net purge  consisted of FF.net choosing to remove approximately 62,000 stories from    Fan Data   345  its site, without notifying authors before the removals, because those stories  allegedly violated the site’s content rating policies  FF.net removed stories  that, in the moderators’ opinions, deserved an “MA” rating—stories con- taining “detailed descriptions of physical interaction of sexual or violent  nature” [Wikinews 2012] .  It is likely that FF.net’s deletion of stories drove many fan fiction authors  to seek out AO3 as a “safe harbor” for their fics. Although FF.net’s 60 per- cent  increase  in  productivity  over  the  last  three  years  seems  remarkable,  AO3’s increase in productivity over the same period has been 323 percent.  Granted, this is the growth over the entire period of time that AO3 has been  in open beta, but even if we look only at the increase from the FF.net purge  in June 2012 through summer 2013, that figure is 101 percent. Therefore,  in part because of FF.net’s imposition of what many fans call censorship of  adult content, AO3 is a faster-growing archive than FF.net, and while it is  not yet as large as FF.net in any category  works, authors, or reviews , it is  well on its way to catching up with the much older archive.  As I noted in earlier chapters, AO3 is an archive for fan works  not only  fan fiction stories, but fanvids, fan art, and other genres of transformative  works, though the vast majority of works uploaded to date have been sto- ries  that has, from its inception, been designed, maintained, and managed  by fans. AO3 is run by a not-for-profit fan organization called the Organi- zation for Transformative Works  OTW , its governing board members are  voted in via online elections open to OTW members, and it is financially  supported  by  donations  from  fans.  The  FF.net,  in  contrast,  is  a  for-profit  company whose governance is not transparent to the public, which gener- ates revenue through advertising on the site. FF.net’s owners and modera- tors can therefore implement content restriction policies and delete users’  stories without advance warning or permission-seeking; the OTW and AO3  were specifically structured so that fans would have greater control over,  and input into, their archives than FF.net and other archives have allowed. Throughout AO3’s initial planning, closed beta, and open beta phases, it  has welcomed feedback and requests from fans as to its affordances. AO3’s  designers and users have had the benefit of years of prior experience with  fan  fiction  archives   Usenet  newsgroups,  Gossamer,  LiveJournal  comms,  and  FF.net,  among  others ;  therefore,  much  collective  intelligence  about  what  fans  desire  and  need  from  fan  archives  has  explicitly  informed  the  architecture  of  AO3.  AO3  combines  utilities  offered  by  previous  archives   Gossamer and FF.net’s database format, FF.net’s author-uploading, review,  and bookmarking features  with new functions, such as the reader being  able  to  hit  a  “Kudos”  button  for  a  fic  without  commenting  on  it,  and    346   Conclusion  authors being able to see how many “Hits,” or views, one of their stories  has received, apart from how many “Comments,” or reviews, have been left  for that particular story. We were able to scrape all of these categories for  AO3, and thus the visualization of AO3’s cumulative data is more detailed  than our visualizations of any other archive.  In its five years of existence  four if we take the open beta entry date as  the launch date , AO3 has accumulated 780,922 works, across 12,023 fan- doms, by 68,675 authors. The average number of works per author is 11.4,  higher by far than FF.net’s 4.5 or Gossamer’s 5.2 average works per author.  Also, while AO3’s average number of works per fandom  65  is far lower  than FF.net’s  672 , it is noteworthy that AO3, a smaller and newer archive,  has 48 percent more fandoms than FF.net  12,023 fandoms in AO3 versus  8,101 fandoms in FF.net . Thus, AO3’s authors are far more productive than  FF.net’s, and AO3 is a much more diverse archive, in terms of the range of  fandoms that it houses.  To  my  earlier  proposition  that  a  high  productivity-per-author  figure  within a fandom suggests that that fandom’s members have a high level of  comfort with online performativity, let me add another proposal: perhaps  AO3’s mission as a fan-built and fan-run institution makes it a “safer space”  for online performance—a safer stage, we might say—than FF.net, and thus  AO3 is already seeing higher rates of productivity in its authors and greater  diversity in its content. In other words, FF.net’s content purge in 2012 could  have signaled to fan authors that some of their content, and perhaps even  entire fandoms, were not welcome on that archive, and thus fans migrated  to AO3, where they felt free to contribute whatever content, in whatever  fandoms, they wished.  An archive whose policies specifically do not place limits or constraints  on  fans’  productions  will  be  preferable,  as  a  space stage  for  fans’  online  performativity, to an archive that announces and enacts content restriction  policies  seemingly   to  its  users   at  random.  High  output-per-author  and  diversity of fandoms may not be desirable to all fic archives—and FF.net  may have had understandable reasons for initiating their purge, for exam- ple, in order to minimize risk of legal action on the part of media watchdog  organizations that seek to shut down websites that expose minors to sexual  content—but I think that most fans want authors to write a great deal, as  much as they can and as much as they want to, in as many fandoms as they  wish. AO3 is a “better” archive than FF.net by the metrics of author produc- tivity and fandom diversity.  There are other interesting lessons from AO3’s data: the number of book- marks in AO3, accumulated from its 2008 launch through summer 2013,    Fan Data   347  is 3,569,258  4.6 bookmarks per work on average ; the cumulative number  of kudos left on works is 21,082,528  27 kudos per work on average ; and  the cumulative number of hits is 668,112,232  855.5 hits per work on aver- age . The fact that there are more kudos than bookmarks left per work is  especially interesting given that AO3 offered the bookmark function from  its 2008 launch, but only introduced the kudos function on December 15,  2010  Archive of Our Own 2010 , so fan readers were not even able to leave  kudos for works they appreciated for the first two years of AO3’s existence;  the data show a clear overwhelming preference for kudos over bookmarks,  but knowing that kudos were not even an option until two years into AO3’s  history makes the preference for kudos even more emphatic. While there  are many more kudos than bookmarks left on works on AO3 as feedback for  authors, most readers choose not to leave any formal feedback for authors:  the number of hits far exceeds the numbers of kudos or bookmarks.  AO3 is the first fan archive that tracks the number of hits  not reviews,  bookmarks,  or  kudos   left  on  works.  Thus,  this  is  the  first  indication  we  have  of  how  large  the  readership  of  fan  fiction  may  be,  apart  from  any  purposeful traces that readers leave of their attention. In other words, AO3  is the first archive that allows us to grasp the actual dimensions of fanfic’s  readership, inclusive of “lurkers.” The figure that we discover—855.5 aver- age hits per work—leads me to wonder: What if 855.5 views per fan fiction  work is typical? What if this were the average hits per story on FF.net? Then  we would postulate that the 5.4 million total stories archived on FF.net have  attracted a total readership of 4,654,784,910. We have no way of knowing  how many people have read stories on FF.net, but if our guess, based on  the AO3 ratio of readers to stories, of more than 4.6 billion hits on the larg- est fan fiction archive over the past fifteen years is even in the ballpark of  accuracy, that would be an extraordinary figure. That number is more than  the number of movie tickets sold in the United States and Canada between  2009 and 2012  3.98 billion tickets [Motion Picture Association of America  2012] . If each hit represented one user reading one story on FF.net over the  past decade and a half, the size of this readership would be the equivalent  of 65 percent of the world’s population  7.1 billion . Again, this is just a  thought exercise, since it is well known that fans do not read just one fan  story each; each fan consumes multiple fanfics over a lifetime. But it is yet  another prompt for readers to consider the world of fan fiction to be more  than a niche subculture.    Appendix: Oral History Project, Demographics, and Ethical  Considerations A A  d d  p p  p p  n n  e e  i i  x x  Fan Fiction and Internet Memory  Much  of  the  primary  qualitative  data  used  in  this  book  was  collected  through an oral history project called “Fan Fiction and Internet Memory”   FFIM , directed by the author. The FFIM project took place from June 16,  2012 through March 2, 2013, with the approval of the University of Cali- fornia, Berkeley’s Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects  CPHS .  The CPHS Protocol Number for the project was 2012-01-3948. The project  was funded by several grants from the UC Berkeley Committee on Research  and the Doreen B. Townsend Center for the Humanities’ Geballe Research  Opportunities for Undergraduates Program  GROUP . The author and two  UC Berkeley students, Andrea Horbinski and Lisa Cronin, conducted fifty- six interviews with fifty individuals who have participated in Internet fan  fiction  archives  as  founders,  archivists,  moderators,  contributors,  and or  users.  Interviewers  followed  CPHS  guidelines  and  requirements,  and  the  Principles and Best Practices for Oral History established by the Oral His- tory Association  2009 : all participants gave “informed consent” to being  interviewed after reviewing written materials stating the goals and terms of  the interviews and a list of possible interview questions, and all were given  the choice to be interviewed anonymously, pseudonymously, or using their  actual names. Participants received gift cards to online retailers following  their interviews.  Demographics  All FFIM participants were given the option to answer demographic ques- tions to any degree of specificity and in any words they chose, or to not  answer the questions if they chose.   350   Appendix  Figure A.1 Demographic information of FFIM oral history project participants.   Appendix   351  Figure  A.1  provides  the  fifty  FFIM  participants’  demographic  informa- tion. The table was created by UC Berkeley doctoral student Adam Hutz,  under the author’s supervision.  Figures A.2 and A.3 provide visualizations of the demographic informa- tion of the FFIM oral history participants. The visualizations were designed  by UC Berkeley doctoral students Andrew Godbehere, Andrea Horbinski,  and  Adam  Hutz,  and  were  generated  by  Godbehere,  under  the  author’s  supervision.  In figures A.2 and A.3, the size of the circles is indicative of the number  of  FFIM  participants  who  gave  the  same  response  to  a  specific  question  about  demographics;  for  example,  the  more  participants  who  responded  “Female” to the question about their gender identification, the larger the  circle containing the trait descriptor “Female.” The thickness of the con- necting “band” between the circles indicates the frequency with which two  traits  were  given  by  the  same  participant;  in  other  words,  the  more  fre- quently “White”  as a racial ethnic identification  and “Female” were given  by the same participant as demographic traits, the thicker the band that  connects those two traits in the visualization.  We opted not to merge any of the participants’ answers. In figure 9.2, for  example, while “White” appears as the most frequently stated racial ethnic  identification, some participants also gave answers such as “Jewish-Amer- ican,” “White British,” “European,” and so on, which might be construed  as the equivalent of “White”; however, we chose to leave each participant’s  self-identifications exactly as he or she stated them. This resulted in a visu- alization that does not contain a circle for “Non-White,” but instead shows  circles for “Korean American,” “Black,” “Asian American,” and so on. Simi- larly, we include circles for the gender identifications such as “Cis female”  and “Female blank,” rather than combining these with “Female.”  Similarly,  in  figure  9.3,  we  created  circles  for  every  response  that  par- ticipants  gave  to  a  question  about  their  sexual  identification,  so  that  in  addition to a circle for the trait “Queer,” there are also circles for “Bisexual,”  “Hetero  Queer,”  “Asexual,”  “Ambiguous,”  as  well  as  a  blank  circle  repre- senting the participants who opted not to answer this question.

Given the preponderance of scholarly publications on the topic  of fan fiction and fan cultures generally that have appeared since the early  1990s, I do not consider online fandom or fan fiction to be a “highly sensi- tive” topic. However, I acknowledge that many individuals may think of  fandom and fan productivity as “private”  i.e., limited to consumption and  interpretation by members  rather than “public.” As a number of Internet  researchers have noted,1 scholars currently lack consensus as to what online  sites  and  communities  scholars  should  be  considered  private  as  opposed  to public; Radhika Gajjala argues that “ideas of private public, closed and  open spaces are blurred and reconfigured”  2002, 182  in online research  methodologies.  The  same  uncertainty  applies  to  quantitative,  “Big  Data”  analyses, such as those that I present in the conclusion, and it may be the  case in the future that fan archives ban data scraping or other third-party  studies of their contents, to protect the privacy of their participants and the  health of the communities that they serve. However, as of this writing in  2014, the websites that are explicitly quoted and the archives scraped have  no stated restrictions on such studies, and I consider them to be public sites. I have chosen to pseudonymize one website, the private torrent tracker   password-protected  peer-to-peer  media  file-sharing  site   that  I  discuss  in  several  chapters,  as  “Sly.”  Although  other  scholarly  publications  have  named this site in the past, I have found none that cite text from the site;  since I quote text and data from the site, I have decided not to name it, to  protect the site from any potential unwanted discovery.

8.  I stress that new media potentially constitutes a “global theater,” but this potential  has  not  yet  been  fully  actualized.  As  research  on  the  “digital  divide”  shows   see  introduction, note 4 , great differences in people’s access to, and education in, digi- tal networked technologies persist, and many regions in the Global South do not  have the capacity to participate in the “global theater” of the Internet. In addition,  as  Paul  Dourish  and  Scott  D.  Mainwaring  note,  many  attempts  by  Global  North  organizations to introduce new media to areas that lack them are highly problem- atic, as they replicate and reenact colonialist attitudes and fail to account for “poly- vocality,  diversity,  and

I am aware that the term “meta” refers to an entire genre of fan works; what fans  call “meta” writings are what most people would call “commentaries” or “analyses”
