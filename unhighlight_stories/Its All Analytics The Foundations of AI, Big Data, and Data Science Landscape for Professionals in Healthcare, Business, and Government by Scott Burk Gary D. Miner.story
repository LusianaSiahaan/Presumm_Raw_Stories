machine learning and artifcial    intelligence are rapidly changing the world that we work and live in. Many    traditional industries and professions are being fundamentally reimagined as    AI industries. It is becoming imperative for those at every level in companies    and organizations  not to mention the general public  to understand both    “what will AI do FOR me?” and “what will AI do TO me?”.   The rapid acceleration in the development and deployment of these technol-   ogies is creating an increasing gap in understanding. Many who need to know  don’t even know what they don’t know. This, coupled with hyperbolic news    releases on some new AI application-of-the-moment, leaves the nontechnical    observer with no easy solution to bridging this gap.   Fortunately, Scott Burk and Gary Miner have astutely recognized this gap in    understanding and offer a starting point for bridging this gap in It's All Analytics!    This volume provides a “20,000 foot overview” of these technologies and serves      as an easily-grasped read for beginning the journey to deeper understanding or  broadening one’s knowledge base. While it is geared towards those with little    or no understanding of AI and machine learning, it is a valuable resource for    those working in these areas who may have a siloed view of the felds.     The authors are uniquely qualifed to deliver this overview as they are both  not only industry practitioners of these technologies, but also educators skilled    at making these topics accessible to the neophyte. They have obviously paid    great attention to readability and organized the material in a way that provides    a memorable framework for pinning the reader's newly gathered knowledge.    Additionally, the book is richly referenced with additional resources for taking    a deeper dive into specifc subject matter.   xv    xvi  ◾  Foreword Number One            I'd like to be among the frst to congratulate the authors on this timely,   engaging, useful, and highly informative read.   John W. Cromwell, M.D., FACS, FASCRS  Associate Chief Medical Offcer  Director of Surgical Quality and Safety  University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics  Director, Division of Gastrointestinal, Minimally Invasive, and Bariatric Surgery  Clinical Associate Professor  University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine  Faculty, Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Informatics  University of Iowa Graduate College  Iowa City, Iowa    Foreword Number Two   Written with focus on the underlying  concept of the entire series of books   This book seeks to reduce the “sea of terms” in Data Science to a systematic  terminology to describe general aspects of AI and Data Science. This system  of terms will permit multiple stakeholders in an organization to speak the  same “language” across the enterprise. This common language will permit  close integration between analytics and those functions in the organization  that precede analytics  e.g. database design and management  and those  deployment functions that follow it  e.g. marketing campaigns .   This book is not a complete expression of the subject, yet it is compre-  hensive in terms of the scope of each part without being comprehensive in  detail. This book is not designed to show the learner how to build an ana- lytical model with a given tool. Rather, it shows learners how to organize  their thinking about the plethora of terms and concepts in Data Science to  provide suffcient insight to permit practitioners to do it properly later on.  Many books are available to show precise sequences of steps with a given  tool for building analytical models   This book is Part I of a three-part series, each one of which will be   covered in a separate book. Part II will describe:  1  the design and man- agement of the database functions necessary to support analytics properly;   2  The structure of the analytics process  e.g. the CRISP-DM analytics pro- cess model , and;  3  The general structure of a modeling application  e.g.  the major steps in building a predictive analytics model . Part III will pres- ent a survey of analytics applications in business and industry. Neither of  these books should be considered as a stand-alone resource in the overall  process of applying analytics in an organization. All 3 parts should be com- bined to compose the design of any analytics application in an organization.   xvii    xviii  ◾  Foreword Number Two            Development of models without the proper deployment system may relegate  the models to the “shelf”, because they can’t be deployed effciently in the  organization.   Each book  and indeed each chapter  is written to be independent of  information in previous chapters, as far as possible. This degree of inde- pendence is facilitated by repeat of relevant terms and principles introduced  in previous chapters, which are required to understand the information in  the current chapter. As such, these chapters are learning “objects”, which  are more or less self-contained. These learning objects must be combined  together to form a seamless solution during execution.   Both this book and the entire series present a “layered” approach to   learning the practice of Data Science. Each layer is designed to be as func- tionally independent as possible, yet easily related to previous layers and  subsequent layers. This layered learning approach follows the Layered  Learning Practice Model  LLPM  shown to be very effective in training  learners to provide specifc clinical or patient services in the practice of  Oncology.   Robert Nisbet, Ph.D.  Goleta, California    Foreword Number Three   Almost 30 years ago I began using the term “Information Democracy”  to describe a world where everyone has timely, relevant, and actionable  insights to carry out the tasks associated with their role – and align them  with the overarching strategy of the organization.   Since that time, we’ve made some progress, but not nearly as much as we  would have hoped. In fact, based on our most recent research, a majority of  organizations report that less than half of their users have such access.   Further to this point, only 43% indicate that they consistently use data in  their decision-making process. And, only a third of organizations claim high  or extremely high data literacy.   Further clouding things is the constant barrage of technologies, tech-  niques, and buzzwords that bombard us each day – including artifcial intel- ligence, data science, machine learning, IoT, edge computing, etc.   The only way that we can make real progress is through education about   the importance and value of business intelligence and analytics, increas- ing data literacy and establishing a solid understanding of all relevant  approaches.   To that end, Drs. Burk and Miner have created what is an excellent addi- tion to the growing body of work available on the subject. In contrast to the  many volumes on the subject, their approach has made many of these topics  readily accessible to the novice or manager seeking a basic understanding as  well as to the data science professional seeking a well-organized reference.   The future of an information democracy is highly dependent upon   knowledgeable management and skilled users. Accordingly, as organizations   xix    xx  ◾  Foreword Number Three            strive to increase their data literacy, and leverage data science, this book  should be required reading.   Howard Dresner  Chief Research Offcer  Dresner Advisory Services  www.dresneradvisory.com    Preface   The Basis for This Book and the Series   The authors have been collaborating on the ideas in this book for years.  We met while working together in the software and technology sector. Each  of us has backgrounds in statistics, machine learning, analytics, healthcare,  and business. We noticed that while the products and solutions in the arti- fcial intelligence  AI , data science and analytics space offered tremendous  value, there was a great deal of misunderstanding of the terminology in and  around this space. Furthermore, we noticed a lot of “reinvention” of methods  that existed for years, meaning that in this “reinvention” many of the same  concepts acquired “new names,” thus adding to the confusion, especially  when attempting to communicate among different disciplines.   This book will dive into many different domains: AI, machine learn-  ing, visual business intelligence  BI , analytics, and more. For brevity, when  we are not explicitly writing about a particular domain  AI, data science ,  we choose to use the term “analytics” as a broad and general term for the  overarching domain. In the end, you shall see, It’s All Analytics! We have  witnessed companies of all sizes and in multiple industries gain tremendous  value from applying analytic methods and technologies. We know there are  companies of all shapes and sizes that are beginning their journey. We know  many others that have deep roots, but in an applied area and cannot see  the “big picture” and know of technologies outside their immediate applica- tion area. We know there are those that struggle with a constantly chang- ing sea of terms and technology. We know some are scared of what they  don’t know, what they are not doing, what they should be doing. Everyone  is moving at a million miles an hour and companies are worried they might  lose their advantage in a competitive market and need to do something  quickly with analytics or expand with some nascent technology. However, it   xxi    xxii  ◾  Preface            is time to take a step back: to survey the landscape and synthesize it. With a  pause, we can view the analytics domain holistically.   Even after years of conversations and numerous emails, it was diffcult for  us to arrive at a title. First, how do you cover a sea of changing terminology,  what is hot what is not – even if it is the same thing? Second, we wanted a  wide applicability to a variety of industries. Some are at differing levels of  maturity and adoption. Thus, the name for this book is a combination of  three of the most commonly used domains and the application space where  these methods have the most opportunity to advance society.   Additionally, we determined that our ambitions were beyond the scope   of a single book. Therefore we are breaking our goals into three books.  The frst, which you are reading, is a book with a goal of synthesizing  disciplines across many educational disciplines and practiced felds at an  executive or professional level. The second book will present design con- siderations for your analytics architecture across the continuum of your com- pany’s program goals – organization, data architecture, analytics architecture.  The third book will provide examples of applications across a very broad  variety of business and policy goals.   Professionals Need This Book   Why do you need this book? No other book has a comprehensive view of  the landscape. Yes, you can get a lot of information from the Internet, but it  is not curated or validated. Is it someone’s blog post who is trying to pro- mote themselves as an expert? Anyone can write a blog and there are many  analytics websites which are platforms for marketecture  promotion of prod- uct or service over capability .   Gartner is an independent analysis frm that reports on the technol-  ogy sector. They phrased one need for this book in several comments on  their website, including the need for members of an organization to speak  the same language. Kasey Panetta  Panetta 2019  stated this clearly: “[Our  need is to]… champion data literacy and teach data as a second language to  enable data-driven business.” She continued by stating,   Imagine an organization where the marketing department speaks  French, the product designers speak German, the analytics team  speaks Spanish and no one speaks a second language… That’s    Preface  ◾  xxiii          essentially how a data-driven business functions when there is no  data literacy.   She points out that this year  2020 , half of all organizations will lack data   literacy skills that are needed to achieve business value.   And Valerie Logan, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner, points out another   important fact  see Panetta 2019 , that the   prevalence of data and analytics capabilities, including artifcial  intelligence, requires creators and consumers to “speak data” as a  common language.… Data and analytics leaders must champion  workforce data literacy as an enabler of digital business and treat  information as a second language.   We will help you speak the language in this book. In fact, we will cover   the dialects of AI, machine learning, analytics, data science, and statistics  and show you what they have in common and what separates them.   What This Book Is and Is Not; Who  Should Not Be Reading This Book   This is not an academic book. We don’t talk about hyper-parameters, the  Stone-Weierstrass theorem or stochastic processes. It is not a scholarly pur- suit; it does not include the same rigor as an academic endeavor. However,  we will provide many references as well as “Resources for the Avid Learner”  throughout the chapters. This book should serve as an introductory refer- ence book and is meant to get you thinking about the broader scope of  disciplines beyond what is available in the hype cycle.   It is not meant to be a daily practitioner’s step-by-step practice guide.   However, it may be very useful to expose a practitioner to a wider view and  provide ideas of alternative methods to their problem set. As any carpenter,  artist or do-it-yourselfer knows, the right tool makes all the difference in the  world.   Therefore, knowing what kinds of problems typically are solved by statis-  tical inference versus machine learning is very helpful.   It does not discuss low-level, nuts-and-bolts recipes for producing   machine learning algorithms, applying algorithms, or determining which sta- tistical test should be used for a particular set of data. It does not talk about    xxiv  ◾  Preface            specifc commercial software vendors, although there is a brief mention of  open source platforms for illustration.   It is not complete. It would be far too big a task to write, or for that mat- ter read, a complete compendium of over a hundred years of thought and  advancement in a wide feld. Our goal is to provide a book that helps make  sense of this wide feld, where there is uniqueness, where there is overlap,  and where there is opportunity.   This is not a book on a specifc area; it is not an AI book, a statistics   book, or a BI book. It is a compilation of disciplines and technologies and  contrasts across those disciplines. It is not a recipe book for how to write  code or where to fnd an open source library for a specifc machine learn- ing algorithm. It does not tell you when to apply a specifc statistical test of  inference or the dos and don’ts of creating a BI dashboard. It is meant to  be a synthesis book  a 101 or survey course on data-driven meth- ods if you will . It encompasses an evolution and rebirth of felds and  technologies and demonstrates how they are interrelated and how they are  independently and inter-reliably useful. It sets you up for success in a career  in analytics by seeing the big picture. In addition, the series will provide a  larger view of analytics across the industry, how to design and operate an  enterprise for success in analytics.   This book is not a history book. We do provide some historical elements  to provide some interesting detail and context, but these are not intended to  be comprehensive in nature. There are some good books on the history of  statistics, mathematics, and AI as well as other felds. Note: most of these are  written for an academic audience or an audience that desires a deep histori- cal perspective.   How This Book Is Organized   This book contains 12 chapters. This frst chapter sets the stage and outlines  more specifc needs and purposes of the book. Chapter 2 provides business    justifcations and design recommendations for creating a successful analytics  program within your organization. It also explains the hype cycle, what you  should pay attention to and what to avoid. Chapter 3 describes the heart and  soul of data, processes as well as other fundamentals – models, algorithms,  and a standard process for analytics projects. In Chapter 4 we look at “ana- lytics” – far and wide from methodology to application. The rest of the book    Preface  ◾  xxv          dives more deeply in the foundations of analytics – BI, machine learning, AI,  data science, big data, statistics, and more.   One of our key objectives is to make this book as valuable to the reader  as possible. One way we want to provide that value is to make it a resource  that can serve as a reference where the reader can pick it up and read a  freestanding chapter on its own without having to pick up at the begin- ning. To make this amenable, we will repeat ourselves; this was a conscious  choice that we hope will not be too much of an inconvenience, but a beneft  when you revisit us here.   It should be noted that we attempt to offer some consistency where it   makes sense. As an example, in Chapters 1 to 3, after the preamble we  begin with a section called “The Hip, the Hype, the Fears, the Intrigue, and  the Reality.” Our goal with this section is to present the reader with what  they might fnd in “the hip,” social media, blogs, user channels… or the  “hype” from marketers, sellers, excitement journalists in press releases… and  then the reality as we see it. We are attempting to help you distinguish the  signal from the noise; we cover this concept in Chapter 3.   We also attempt to outline the objectives for the chapter up front in the   “Key Words,” “Preamble” and “Introduction” sections so that you know what  to expect from the chapter. This is intended to support the goal of being  a reference book down the line. Chapters conclude with postscripts, refer- ences, and “Resources for the Avid Learner” sections.   We want this book to be a pleasure to read as well as to provide valu- able information. While this is not a “hands-on” or methods book, we do  want you to mentally practice the concepts presented here. We offer many  examples and thought exercises in gray boxes to stimulate your reading and  improve attention. The book should fow without reading every gray box,  but these gray boxes should make for reading that is more enjoyable.   In summary, we have noticed a changing sea of terminology. We know  that much of this is generated by companies, technologists and consultants.  We recognize software and technology have improved greatly over time,  but much has just been relabeled. Without changing names of techniques,  it is diffcult to sound innovative and fresh. Marketers, product managers  and consultants are pushed to be more innovative, to differentiate, and to  forge new horizons. We understand. However, we want to help profession- als in the feld understand some of the underlying foundations, some of the  relationships and some ways to think about the subject. Leaders and practi- tioners are confused about what is relevant and what is not. Fear of missing    xxvi  ◾  Preface            out  FOMO  is causing panic and mis-investment. We hope to clarify some  of these misunderstandings in this book series.   Your Authors,  Scott Burk, Ph.D. Temple, Texas  Gary D.

Endorsements   Almost every company in the world now understands the critical impor- tance of collecting, processing, analyzing, and acting upon data. The largest  hurdles impeding companies in this process aren't caused by technical limi- tations or a lack of trained specialists, but by the people who need to under- stand how it affects them, what can be done, and how to implement and  manage it within their organization, but don't. In this book, Burk and Miner  help to solve that problem in language that is straightforward, sensible, and  based on their considerable experience. If actionable analytics is a key need  for your organization, and you want to minimize the struggle and confusion  required to implement it, you should read this book.   Dylan Zwick  Former Director of Data Science, Overstock.com   Burk and Miner have created a map to guide anxious and overwhelmed  executives through the rapidly changing and often unwieldy landscape of  data and analytics techniques and technologies. Their survey cuts through  the hype and hyperbole and enables data practitioners and non-practitioners  to clearly communicate how to understand, optimize, and ultimately trans- form their business processes through analytics. Highly recommended.   Josh Wills  Former Director of Data Engineering, Slack   It’s All Analytics! deserves a prominent place on executives’ bookshelves.  Burk and Miner have undertaken a noteworthy challenge in their synthe- sis of data science, machine learning, data mining, artifcial intelligence,  and statistics, presented at a level both useful and provocative to business   xxvii    xxviii  ◾  Endorsements            leaders. The chapter on statistics particularly flls a gap in current discourse  about the latest fashions in AI and Machine Learning.   Loren Williams  Former Chief Data Scientist, Big Four   The rise of artifcial intelligence brings us excitement and hope, but also  causes some anxiety and even fear. The internet is fooded with a sea  of terminology and concepts. For anyone who is interested in learning  more about AI, numerous online courses, articles, blogs are at fnger tips.  However, not all information has been curated, thus resulting in a tremen- dous amount of confusion and a great deal of misunderstanding.   I am thrilled that Scott and Gary compact several decades of history of  AI, data science, analytics, an incredible amount of terminology, concepts,  and a comprehensive view of the current landscape, all into this one book.  With their years of experience across a broad spectrum of industry, the  book offers many practical examples and thought exercises, and explains  complex concepts in simple language.   Business executives will beneft from this book with in-depth understand-  ing of the technical concept and capability, as well as organizational plan- ning and strategy; people leaders will get help to build a strong team with  the right talents, tooling, and capability; technical professionals will broaden  their view of the data science world and have a clearer expectation of career  path.   I have found this book extremely comprehensive and practical, and it  offers an objective and informed view. What makes it even more valuable  is that it is a synthesis book and serves as a reference that can be used for  many years to come.   If you have an ambition to sail in the sea of AI, this is the com-  pass that you must carry in your pocket.

There is a lot to like about this book. A whole lot.  The frst thing I liked was that it was interesting. It doesn’t read like a   cold, boring academic treatise. Instead it reads almost like a mystery novel  – where one page invites the next. This plain spoken approach opens the  doors of analytics to anyone who is interested.   And that is good. Because in the world to come, analytics is THE key to   success and survival.   Explaining analytics to the everyperson is not a simple or easy thing to   do. For many years analytics has been wrapped up in confusing algorithms,  spurious terms, and specious formulae. Yesterday you had to have a Ph.D. in  order to gain a foothold into the wondrous realm of analytics. But in tomor- row’s world analytics are going to become so pervasive that analytics will  become as common as soda pop or ice cream.   In order to be able to swim with the sharks of tomorrow you have to   have the basics of analytics.

Bill Inmon    Recognized by many as the father of the data warehouse  Denver, Colorado     Authors   Scott Burk has been solving complex business and health care problems  for 25 years through science, statistics, machine learning, and business  acumen. Burk started his career, well actually in analytics, as an analytic  chemist after graduating with a double major in biology and chemistry from  Texas State University. He continued his education, going to school at night  taking advanced courses in science and math at the University of Texas at  Dallas  UTD . He then started programming at the toxicology lab where he  was working and thus started taking computer science  CS  and business  courses until he graduated with a Master’s in Business with a concentration  in fnance soon after from UTD.   Texas Instruments  TI  hired him as a fnancial systems analyst in   Semiconductor Group, but due to TI’s needs and Burk’s love of computers,  he soon became a systems analyst for corporate TI. He worked there  for three years and started itching to get back to school  even though he  continued to take courses at night [Operations Research and CS] through  TI’s generous educational program . TI granted him an educational leave of  absence and he went to Baylor University to teach in the business school  and get a Ph.D. in statistics. He joined Baylor as a non-tenure-track professor  teaching quantitative business analysis  today = business analytics .   After graduating, Burk went back to TI as a decision support manager   for the consumer arm of TI  today = consulting data scientist , where  he engaged in many functional areas – marketing and sales, fnance,  engineering, logistics, customer relations, the call center, and more. It was a  dream job, but unfortunately, TI exited that business.   Burk joined Scott and White, a large integrated healthcare delivery   system in Texas as a consulting statistician. He moved into an executive  role as Associate Executive Director, Information Systems leading Data  Warehousing, Business Intelligence and Quality Organizations working with  clinics, hospitals and the health plan. At the same time, he received a faculty   xxxi    xxxii  ◾  Authors            appointment and taught informatics with Texas A&M University. He left but  later came back to Baylor, Scott and White  BSW  as Chief Statistician for  BSW Healthplan.   Burk continued his education, getting an advanced management   certifcation from Southern Methodist University  SMU  and Master’s Degree   MS  in data mining  machine learning  from Central Connecticut State  University. Burk is a frm believer in lifelong learning.   He also worked as Chief Statistician at Overstock, re-engineering the  way they tested and evaluated marketing campaigns and other programs   analytics, statistics . He launched its “total customer value” program. He  was a lead pricing scientist  analytics, optimization  for a B2B pricing  optimization company  Zilliant  for a number of years. He thoroughly  enjoyed working with a richly diverse, well-educated group that affected the  way he looks at multidisciplinary methods of solving problems.   He was a Risk Manager for eBay Paypal, identifying fraud and other risks   on the platform and payment system. He has been working the last few  years supporting software development, marketing and sales, specifcally  data infrastructure, data science, and analytics platforms for Dell and now  TIBCO. He supports his desire to learn and keep current by writing and  teaching in the Masters of Data Science Program at the City University of  New York.   Gary Miner received his B.S. from Hamline University, St. Paul, MN with    biology, chemistry, and education majors; his M.S. in Zoology & Population    Genetics from the University of Wyoming; and his Ph.D. in Biochemical    Genetics from the University of Kansas as the recipient of a NASA Pre-Doctoral    Fellowship. During the doctoral study years, he also studied mammalian    genetics at The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, under a College    Training Program on an NIH award; and another College Training Program    at the Bermuda Biological Station, St. George’s West, Bermuda in a marine    developmental embryology course, on an NSF award; and a third college    training program held at the University of California, San Diego at the Molecular    Techniques in Developmental Biology Institute, again on an NSF award.   Following that he studied as a post-doctoral student at the University   of Minnesota in Behavioral Genetics, where, along with research in  schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease  AD , he learned “how to write  books” from assisting in editing two book manuscripts of his mentor,  Irving Gottesman, Ph.D.  Dr. Gottesman returned the favor 41 years later    Authors  ◾  xxxiii          by writing two tutorials for the book Practical Text Mining . After academic  research and teaching positions, Miner did another two-year NIH post- doctoral in psychiatric epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of  Iowa, where he became thoroughly immersed in studying affective disorders  and Alzheimer’s disease. Altogether, he spent over 30 years researching and  writing papers and books on the genetics of Alzheimer’s disease  Miner,  G.D., Richter, R, Blass, J.P., Valentine, J.L, and Winters-Miner, Linda. Familial    Alzheimer’s Disease: Molecular Genetics and Clinical Perspectives. Dekker:  New York, 1989; and Miner, G.D., Winters-Miner, Linda, Blass, J.P., Richter,  R, and Valentine, J.L. Caring for Alzheimer’s Patients: A Guide for Family &  Healthcare Providers. Plenum Press Insight Books: New York, 1989 .   Over the years he has held positions, including professor and chairman of   a department, at various universities including the University of Kansas, the  University of Minnesota, Northwest Nazarene University, Eastern Nazarene  University, Southern Nazarene University, Oral Roberts University Medical  School, where he was Associate Professor of Pharmacology and Director  of the Alzheimer Disease & Geriatric Disorders Research Laboratories and  even for a period of time in the 1990s was a visiting clinical professor of  psychology for geriatrics at the Fuller Graduate School of Psychology &  Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, CA.   In 1985 he and his wife, Dr. Linda Winters-Miner  author of several   tutorials in this book  founded The Familial Alzheimer’s Disease Research  Foundation  aka “The Alzheimer’s Foundation” , which became a leading  force in organizing both local and international scientifc meetings and thus  bringing together all the leaders in the feld of genetics of AD from several  countries, which then lead to the writing of the frst scientifc book on the  genetics of Alzheimer’s disease; this book included papers by over 100  scientists coming out of the First International Symposium on the Genetics  of Alzheimer’s Disease held in Tulsa, OK in October 1987. During part  of this time, he was also an affliate research scientist with the Oklahoma  Medical Research Foundation located in Oklahoma City with the University  of Oklahoma School of Medicine.     Miner was infuential in bringing all of the world’s leading scientists  working on genetics of AD together at just the right time when various    laboratories from Harvard to Duke University and the University of      California-San Diego, to the University of Heidelberg, in Germany,  and universities in Belgium, France, England and Perth, Australia were    beginning to fnd “genes” which they thought were related to Alzheimer’s    disease.    xxxiv  ◾  Authors            During the 1990s Dr. Miner was appointed to the Oklahoma Governor’s   Task Force on Alzheimer’s Disease, and also was Associate Editor for  Alzheimer’s Disease for The Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry & Neurology,  which he still serves on to this day. By 1995 most of these dominantly  inherited genes for AD had been discovered, and the one that Miner had  been working on since the mid-1980s with the University of Washington  in Seattle was the last of these initial 5 to be identifed, this gene on  Chromosome 1 of the human genome. At that time, having met the goal  of fnding out some of the genetics of AD, Miner decided to do something  different, to fnd an area of the business world, and since he had been  analyzing data for over 30 years, working for StatSoft, Inc. as a senior  statistician and data mining consultant, which seemed a perfect “semi- retirement” career. Interestingly  as his wife had predicted , he discovered  that the “business world” was much more fun than the “academic world,”  and at a KDD-Data Mining meeting in 1999 in San Francisco, he decided  that he would specialize in “data mining.” Incidentally, he frst met Bob  Nisbet there, who told him, “You just have to meet this bright young rising  star John Elder!,” and within minutes Bob found John and introduced me  to him, as he was also at this meeting  Dr. John Elder had just formed  ELDER RESEARCH, INC, and he and I think just two other people were  running this “start up operation” in data mining research and consulting;  today ELDER RESEARCH INC in Charlottesville, Virginia, has close to 100  employees and is a top Data Mining Data Analytics consulting frm that has  developed solutions for many agencies of our US government along with  numerous commercial companies, and also runs training sessions around  the world – see John’s bio at:  https:  www.elderresearch.com company   our-team john-f-elder-iv-phd .   As Miner delved into this new “data mining” feld and looked at statistics   textbooks in general, he saw the need for “practical statistical books” and  started writing chapters and organizing various outlines for different books.  Miner, Nisbet and Elder kept running into each other at KDD meetings, and  eventually at a breakfast meeting in Seattle in August of 2005 they decided  they needed to write a book on data mining, and right there reorganized  Miner’s outline, which eventually became the book Handbook of Statistical  Analysis and Data Mining Applications, 2009, published by Elsevier. And  then, in 2012, he was the lead author on a second book from Elsevier   Academic Press, Practical Text Mining. And then a third in this “series” in  2015: Practical Predictive Analytics and Decisioning Systems for Medicine.

Chapter 1  You Need This Book   Keywords: Bias, Media, Hype, Landscape, AI  Artifcial Intelligence , ML   Machine Learning , Analytics, Big Data   Preamble   The authors have heard that we need to be data-driven for more than 20  years. We hear the same thing today! What happened!! Have we ignored  the message?? Have we done it wrong? Probably the latter… Thus this book.  Why do you need this book? No other book has a comprehensive view of  the landscape. Yes, you can get a lot of information from the Internet, but it  is not curated or validated. Is it someone’s blog post who is trying to pro- mote themselves as an expert? Anyone can write a blog and there are many  analytics websites which are platforms for marketecture, which means form  without substance.   This book is Part 1 of a three-part series. This series will attempt to   set the record straight and make it easy for the practitioner or the execu- tive decision-maker to understand what they really need in their setting.  In Chapter 1 we look at why you need an unbiased understanding of the  subject in order to make the right decisions – how and when you need to  be data-driven.   1    2  ◾       It’s All Analytics!     The Hip, the Hype, the Fears,  the Intrigue, and the Reality:      Hype, Fear, and Intrigue No 1:   The worrying question today for many is whether democracy can  survive artifcial intelligence  AI . The reality is that disruptive tech- nologies like AI cannot be put back in the box. AI is becoming a  mainstream technology that will need to be effectively integrated  into 21st-century decision-making across all institutions – especially  government. In the wake of this digital revolution, some functions  of government will necessarily be eliminated.    Araya, Forbes, 2019       Reality     As long as elected offcials are in offce, they will not cede control  to AI or anything else but themselves. Anyway, most AI is aug-   mentation of human intelligence, not replacement of it. As far as    we can see, the democratic governments of the West will not be  replaced anytime soon. It is interesting that the same article men-   tions impacts to China and we fnd these predictions much more    likely. With AI, China could defnitely entrench its authority into    a digital technocracy. Unlike the West, in which there is a major    push in pulling back the covers of AI and adopting policies such as    GDPR  General Data Protection Regulation , communist countries  could use AI to strengthen their hand and control over the masses.   Hype, Fear, and Intrigue No 2:   As Jonathan Zittrain commented in a panel discussion sponsored by  Harvard Medical School, Precision Medicine June 2019:   I think of machine learning  artifcial intelligence  kind of like  asbestos… It turns out that it’s all over the place, even though at  no point did you explicitly install it, and it has possibly some latent  bad effects that you might regret later, after it’s already too hard to  get it all out.    You Need This Book  ◾  3           Reality   How easy it is to turn such comments into an article purporting  that AI and machine learning  ML  are the new cancer-causing  agents that will make millions sick and law frms rich. However,    you really need to take all the comments and the related contexts  of these comments into consideration. Many of the statements  made were accurate and we will review and analyze these in later  sections. However, the reader has seen remarks like the ones men- tioned above turned into a gloom and doom sensational article.    We do not think this was Professor Zittrain’s intent; many of the  comments he made were accurate and we will review and analyze  these in later sections as well as a related article by Casey Ross.   Hype, Fear, and Intrigue No 3:   Headline – “Will robots take your job? Humans ignore the coming AI   Artifcial Intelligence  revolution at their peril”  NBCNEWS.COM, November  2018 . Robots are taking over industrial manufacturing and they will soon  take over food production and restaurant kitchens. In just a few years they  will take over trucking, ride services, the fnancial industry, accounting,  healthcare, and citizen services. Humans will be able to pursue their desires  and do whatever they wish without needing to work.   Reality   The AI revolution started back in the 1950s, but you would never  guess that based on the headlines today. It is sensationalized like  it is brand-new, nascent technology. Even special programming  languages like Lisp were adopted to support AI research in the late  1950s. Over the years since then, AI has been resurrected a few  times: for example, Texas Instruments created a special computer  called the TI Explorer specifcally to do very fast  for the time   computing and was used in for AI scheduling of the Hubble Space  Telescope even in the 1970s and 1980s and continuing forward   Miller, 1989; and Johnston and Miller, 1992 . It is true that this  new era of AI this time in the 2nd and 3rd decades of the 21st  century is more substantial than ever, but robots will not displace  humans. We see AI and other technologies enhancing human exis- tence. It will have positive impacts on everything from personal    4  ◾       It’s All Analytics!     transportation to augmented citizen services and government  see  Mehr, 2017 . We must be careful; it benefts most people to have  a basic understanding of what AI is, what it is not and how it will  impact them. Every technological revolution has displaced workers  but also created new opportunities. Those workers that were willing  to learn new technology and adapt succeeded and those that did  not were left to wither.   PREVALENCE OF ANALYTICS, AI AND   DATA SCIENCE IN EVERYDAY LIFE   Example of the HYPE about AI and ML– we see it almost EVERY  DAY now in the news and social media; here is an example  pulled from “One moment in time” on a day in early July 2019:  AI  and  ML  dominate  the  news  including  LinkedIn  –  7 6 19   Saturday   pulled  from  LinkedIn  –  They  do  a  daily  notifcation  on  their  “DAILY  RUNDOWN” newsfeed. The following is just an example, but indicative  of how prevalent this subject is in professional news cycles. There are  5 headlines and 4 of the 5 are related to the topics in this book.  www.  linkedin.com pulse breakthrough-hiv-research-tech-takes-beatles-mo      re-top-rundown-us-                                                  Scientists claim they have cured nine mice of HIV for the frst  time  in  history,  according  to  a  new  study   Dash,  PK;  Kaminski,  R;  Gendelman et al., 2019 . The researchers from Temple University and the  University  of  Nebraska  Medical  Center  used  a  combination  of  CRISPR  gene-editing technology and an antiretroviral therapy called LASER ART  to kill the virus. One of the doctors who coauthored the report called it a  “major breakthrough.” About 1.1 million people in the U.S. live with HIV   Turner, 2019 , which is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system  and if left untreated, can turn into AIDS.   Breaking  down  the  Beatles:  Paul  McCartney  and  John  Lennon  wrote some of the most famous songs in history, yet for the songs where  they  are  listed  as  coauthors;  it  is  not  clear  who  wrote  what.  With  the  help  of  a  machine,  a  team  of  researchers  from  Harvard  and  Canada’s  Dalhousie University developed a system where they were able to cor- rectly differentiate Lennon’s tracks from McCartney’s with 76% accuracy.  They then applied this model to eight songs or fragments of songs whose  authorship is a bit murky.    You Need This Book  ◾  5           Fewer American teens are getting jobs. Over the past nearly two  decades,  teenage  labor  force  participation  has  dropped  signifcantly  –  15.9% between 2000 and 2018, according to research compiled by the  Brookings  Institute   Glickman,  Brown,  and  Song,  2019 .  Fewer  teens   16- to 19-year-olds  are seeking summer employment, and they’re also  becoming less likely to double up on school and work during the aca- demic year. “The intensity of high school may have increased in ways  that have helped crowd out non-school activities,” per Brookings.                   No Amazon? No problem for Long Island City. The Queens neigh- borhood,  according  to  real  estate  data  acquired  by  Vox   Molla,  2019 ,  leased more commercial property in the frst half of 2019 than it has in  any year since such data started to be recorded. Last November, Amazon  tapped  Long  Island  City  to  be  the  location  of  its  second  headquarters   HQ2 . And although protests forced the e-commerce giant to scrub its  plans, the activity still “functioned as a giant advertisement”  Molla, 2019   for the New York neighborhood.   AI is poised to play a bigger role in healthcare, from speeding  up  drug  development  to  helping  to  diagnose  disease.  But  to  do  so,  it  needs data  and lots of it . According to the World Health Organization   Wall,  2019 ,  AI  can  currently  only  access  20%  of  global  medical  data.  And while making more available could spur innovation and help over- come resource shortages, it also requires trust – that patient data “won’t  be used for commercial reasons without their consent or to discriminate  against people,” WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan tells the BBC   Wall, M., 2019 .         And you see it all over the Internet. Credible analyst frms and premier  management consulting frms are supporting the new wave, a tsunami  into  AI, data  science  and  analytics. According  to  a  Forrester  Research  report from 2017 published in Forbes  see Press, 2016 . “AI-driven enter- prises will steal 1.2 trillion from competitors by 2020.” That is a pretty  bold claim, but they are not the only research frm making these kinds  of predictions. In a 2018 report titled Notes from the AI frontier: mod- eling the impact of AI on the world economy  see Bughin et al., 2018 ,    McKinsey and Co. analyzed 400 use cases in 19 different industries to  understand the broad use and signifcant economic potential of deploy- ing advanced deep learning AI techniques. It found that companies with  faster AI adoption and absorption  Front Runners  are creating big eco- nomic gains.         6  ◾       It’s All Analytics!     Professionals Need This Book   Introduction   Gartner is an independent analysis frm that reports on the technology sec- tor. They phrased one need for this book in several comments on their web- site including the need for members of an organization to speak the same  language. Kasey Panetta  Panetta, 2019  stated this clearly: “[Our Need is  to]… champion data literacy and teach data as a second language to enable  data-driven business.” She continued by stating:   Imagine an organization where the marketing department speaks  French, the product designers speak German, the analytics team  speaks Spanish and no one speaks a second language… That’s    essentially how a data-driven business functions when there is no  data literacy.   She points out that this year  2020  half of all organizations will lack data  literacy skills that are needed to achieve business value.   And Valerie Logan, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner, points out another   important fact  see Panetta, 2019 , that the   … prevalence of data and analytics capabilities, including AI,  requires creators and consumers to “speak data” as a common lan- guage… Data and analytics leaders must champion workforce data  literacy as an enabler of digital business and treat information as a  second language.   We will help you speak the language in this book. In fact, we will cover the  dialects of AI, ML, analytics, data science, statistics and show you what they  have in common and what separates them. First, let’s look at some incen- tives for this needed education.   Technology Keeps Raging, but We Need More  Than Technology to Be Successful   Technology is raging and has been for several years and data is the new oil.  Much of the growth in the last few years could be loosely described as “cre- ating value from data.” This is our mantra for this book – creating value    You Need This Book  ◾  7           from data! Value could mean increasing sales revenue, reducing avoid- able costs, improving patient satisfaction, targeting high-value customers  and prospects, creating policy for the broadest social good and much, much  more.   The rise and speed of technology innovation have created a lot of stir in  the media, the press, universities, businesses, and government. Some of the  information is accurate and useful. Some of this information is inaccurate  and confusing. Some of it is beyond the reach of the average professional  or student because it is either too narrowly focused or too technical without  the necessary background. This book is about simplifying the subject for an  interested reader in a non-threating, non-technical, broad viewpoint. We  consider the information presented in this text as what we would cover if  we were to teach a “Creating Value from Data 101” course at a university,  what some would call a “survey course.”   We have spent hundreds of billions of dollars collecting data, but most of  it sits in silos. Silos of data never analyzed, never touched again. Not only a  sunk cost to acquire but also the cost to maintain, backup or archive – the  cost is tremendous. Everyone has talked about monetizing this data, but  few are very successful. We have been talking about using it for decades   Green, 2016 , but we have barely scratched the surface. To be clear, it is not  technology that is hampering the progress. It is lack of vision, human capi- tal, and execution. The purpose of this book is to help with increasing the  knowledge, enabling execution and squeezing dollars from data by inform- ing professionals about creating value from data.   We will cover many of the analytical areas at a topical level. It is diffcult   to keep up with all the advancements in these areas. Society and industry  have been collecting data for years and years. We have been increasing our  collection exponentially. We actually analyze very little of what we collect,  but there are big efforts to change that. We explore these advancements for  the professional that desires to understand the big picture of analytics, data  science, AI and related felds.   There is a HUGE overlap in the areas where value is created from data.  This is not by accident as we will explain. But, for now take a look at the  dizzying list of overlapping subject areas:   ◾  Business Intelligence  BI     ◾  Visual BI, Analytics    ◾  Visual Analytics    ◾  Business Analytics      8  ◾       It’s All Analytics!     ◾  Data Analytics    ◾  Predictive Analytics    ◾  Prescriptive Analytics    ◾  Advanced Analytics    ◾  Text Analytics    ◾  Graph Analytics    ◾  Social Analytics    ◾  Network Analytics    ◾  Modern Analytics    ◾  Directed Acyclic Graph  DAG  Analytics    ◾  Statistics    ◾  Optimization    ◾  Data Mining    ◾  Data Modeling    ◾  ML    ◾  Big Data    ◾  Data Science    ◾  Decision Science    ◾   Enterprise or Business  Decision Management    ◾  Business Process Management    ◾  Data Engineering    ◾  AI    ◾  Computational Intelligence    ◾  Auto ML    ◾  Management Science    ◾  Linear and Mathematical Programming    ◾  Deep Learning, Informatics    ◾  Decision Science    ◾  Many others     We think there is a need for simplifcation, for “One Global Term” that  applies to each of these. We believe analytics is the appropriate umbrella  term that captures the spirit of all these methods; thus in this book, we will  oftentimes use the word analytics when we are not focusing on a specifc  form.   These are some of the most in vogue technologies; but additionally,   you still have many college subject areas such as accounting, economics,  engineering felds, fnance, operations research, industrial engineering and  related science disciplines that stand on their own and use data to create    You Need This Book  ◾  9           value. In fact, many of these majors are starting to apply these new Analytics  methods. We will not cover these traditional degree areas, as we do not con- sider them a part of the hype cycle. These disciplines may incorporate some  of these new analytic methods but have many of their own methods to solve  quantitative problems and are free-standing subjects.   Professionals are also impacted by displacement of jobs to automated   technologies – factory automation, cashier-less no check-out stores, self-driv- ing cars, busses, trains and trucks, automated telemedicine and radiology,  smart warehouses, intelligent agents and robots. These are just a few ways  AI will disrupt the global workforce. McKinsey  Manyika et al., 2017  reports  that as many as 400 and 800 million jobs could be displaced by automation  by 2030 worldwide.   Even the AI and analytics industry is predicted to “eat its own,”           meaning that machines will replace AI programmers and we will have    self-aware systems like Skynet in Terminator. These highly intelligent    machines will replace the smartest data scientists and programmers.    Computer software generating computer code has been a reality for many    years. These are CASE  Computer Aided Software Engineering  technolo- gies  Wikipedia, 2019b , but yet the need for developers, computer scien- tists, and applied mathematicians has never been higher. We do not see    the machines taking over all the jobs for many years to come, but it does    make for interesting reading and has for decades. Do not get us wrong,    AI has enhanced our lives greatly and will continue to do so, but this    has been going on for years, and given the observed data on automation    throughout the years, humans have found a way to stay relevant. We cover    more about topics of automation in later chapters, for example, AutoML in    Chapter 6.   These developments have been and will continue to dominate a large   part of the business news cycle.   ARE YOU FEARFUL?   Do you fear that you are keeping pace with technology on this front? Do  you have a general understanding of this space? Are you currently using  some of these technologies, but are naïve in some of the others? Is your  enterprise engaged in some of these technologies and you want to know  more? Are you contemplating a career change and want to grasp a basic  understanding of these burgeoning felds? Then keep reading.    10  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Data and Analytics Explosion   The volume of data collected is growing exponentially with no end in sight.  According to a study by IDC  International Data Corporation , an analyst  reported  Reinsel et al., 2017 :              1  IDC predicts that the Global Datasphere will grow from 33  Zettabytes in 2018 to 175 Zettabytes by 2025  a Zettabyte is  1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes, 1 billion terabytes. If one person    downloaded this amount of data at 25 megabytes per second  aver- age speed in the United States today  it would take 1.8 billion years  to download it. If everyone on the planet joined in 24 hours a day it  would still take 81 days. See Figure 1.1  Adapted from Reinsel et al.,  2017, Data Age 2025; Seagate, 2020     increased by 9% from 2017 to 2018     data, but by 2025 it will be 6 billion or 75% of the world’s population  In 2025 there will be 150 billion devices creating data in real time.  Many will be edge devices on the manufacturing foor, or sensors in  smart cities  Figure 1.1 .   3  November 2018 there were 5 billion consumers that interacted with   2  The compounded annual growth rate  CAGR  of 61%  and this estimate   Figure 1.1  Annual size of global data  Adapted from Reinsel et al. 2017, Data Age  2025; The Digitization of the World [IDC Nov 2018] .       You Need This Book  ◾  11           IOT AND DATA STATISTICS ARE STAGGERING   Some similar statistics to the IDC report are presented by a product man- ager at a hardware company, Cisco  see Stack, February 2018  on data,  Who Is Using Data and How:   IoT and data statistics are staggering, to the point of appearing fantastical:   ◾  5  quintillion  bytes  of  data   produced  every  day   that’s  2.5  fol-       ◾  By the year 2020, the IoT will comprise more than 30 billion con-          lowed by 18 zeros    nected devices.   ◾  These devices include smart home and smart car devices, medical    devices  from  routine  patient  monitoring  like  blood  pressure  and  heart  rate  monitoring  to  implanted  medical  devices  like  pacemak- ers, defbrillators  see the section on Next Generation Medical Devices  – Human Enhancement for what may be coming . Agriculture 3.0,  includes self-driving tractors, feld sensors, satellite data and much  more. And of course, automated factories and warehouses are full of  sensors and data.   ◾  It would take a lifetime to manually analyze the data produced by a     single sensor on a manufacturing assembly line   No wonder studies reveal that:  ◾  Only  26% of companies surveyed reported that their IoT initiatives        have been successful   No  wonder  the  Harvard  Business  Review   Davenport,  April  2017    found that:   ◾  Less than half of structured data is actively used in decision making    ◾  Less than 1% of unstructured data is analyzed or used at all     Collecting data is a cost and a liability. First, it takes money to create the     connectors into the source data. This could be creating pathways or pipes into      databases or data lakes through the extract, transform and load  ETL  process.  More commonly now is the creation of application protocol interfaces  APIs     that bring data from the web  services , cloud, software as a service  SaaS  and    other data connections – more about this in Chapter 9 on data.    12  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Second, in addition to the cost of creating and supporting the connec-  tions, you have the costs of the pipes themselves, fber, networks, and wire- less devices. You have the cost of storage. These costs are not just buying or    renting the infrastructure, but the labor associated with keeping everything    running, fail-over redundancy and back-up recovery plans. This runs into the    billions of dollars in the United States. You could say that this is the cost of    running a business. But, not really, as most of this data sits idle. We collect    far more than we ever analyze. It is like all the boxes of memorabilia, clothes,    and knickknacks in your attic that you keep because you might want it or    need it someday. But you never take it out. And, as it ages, it loses value.  More importantly, you have the liability. Heard of any data breaches   lately? Companies are often not aware of the information that sits in legacy  databases. Moreover, there is legal liability from  former  employees on  email systems and related databases that are never purged and thus discov- erable in lawsuits and other legal proceedings.   According to Forbes  Meehan, 2016  it is estimated that as much as 90%  of big data is never analyzed. In fact, it is so large that Gartner has coined  a term called “Dark Data.” Dark Data describes the information assets orga- nizations collect, process and store, during regular business activities, but  generally fail to use for other purposes  for example, analytics, business  relationships and direct monetizing . Most organizations fail to use this data,  but it could and should be used. Data is a strategic asset.   We have a problem. We have all this data being collected at a great   expense, but we are not gaining value from it. That is where the disciplines  in this book can help. This book is about taking data that took money to  collect, provision and store and turning into actionable insights that drive  value by decreasing costs, driving revenue and improving quality. In addi- tion, the value of data decreases with time, so data sitting in silos decrease  in value every day.   Now we look at the potential in collecting all that data. Estimates differ,   but according to Forbes  January 2017  the market for business analytics will  be US$203 billion in 2020 and is growing at a 12% CAGR. Contrast this with  Computing Technology Industry Association  CompTIA  estimating that the  global information technology industry would grow at a rate of 4% in 2019   CompTIA, 2019 , much slower than the analytics market. And data moneti- zation, which is the process of using data to generate revenue, will become  a major source of income for this 17× increase in data being collected  from 2015 to 2025; and these estimates are constantly being raised so the  growth is a rising exponential function. In summary, there will be increasing    You Need This Book  ◾  13           demand for people that know how to turn data into insights or how data  can impact their enterprise or community.   We estimate that virtually every worker in the United States will be   impacted by these developments in the next 5 to 10 years. These impacts  may be direct, meaning you will be responsible to employ one or more of  these methods into your work function. Alternatively, they may be quasi- direct, in that your work process will be a consumer and thus you will  need to be trained commensurately. Or, your job will be displaced by these  methods.   Our intent in this book is to provide a bird’s eye view of the disciplines   involved in this revolution, their application and why you should have a  basic understanding of them.   IBM is projecting that demand for data scientists will soar by 28%      Columbus, 2017 . Based on this article, jobs requiring ML skills are pay- ing an average of US$114,000. If we change the term to “data analyst,” we    see that in the United States the average salary is US$64,814 per year, but    ranges from US$18,000 to US$139,000 depending on what company one    is working for  Indeed, updated August 9, 2019 . If we change the title to    “healthcare data analyst,” we see that the average salary is US$61,194, with    a range from US$46,000 to US$82,000  Payscale, 2019; updated August 12,    2019 .   But the need for “healthcare data analytics” jobs is going to increase   rapidly in the months and years ahead with the supply of qualifed people  being less than needed, so these salaries should increase.      However, the person that wants to become a data scientist has to apply  themselves. In the past we have seen that many people want to learn data  science, but yet not too many of these people actually become data scien- tists. This is probably because learning data science is diffcult, as it’s a com- bination of many hard skills  like learning to program in Python and SQL ,    soft skills  like business skills or communication skills  and “in-between”    skills like learning how to use  mostly automated  AI and ML software to  get the fnal predictions and decisions. But before getting these predictions  and decisions, about 80% of the data scientist’s time is spent on data acqui- sition and data cleaning  Mester, 2019; Miner et al., 2015; Nisbet, Miner, and  Yale, 2018 .    14  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     A Bright Side of the Revolution   This explosive growth is good news for professionals currently employed in    these data related areas, and also for those considering careers in data science.    There will be jobs at all levels from the very technical levels of AI and data sci- ence, to business analysts and “citizen data scientists”  more about that later , to    project managers, subject matter experts, and related professionals. It will also    impact everyone on the strategic and operational side of the enterprise: chief    executives, chief medical offcers, elected offcials, and policy directors.   The professional areas covered in this book are not only growing,     but also some of the most satisfying according to job surveys. A Harvard    Business Review entitled, “Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century”       Davenport and Patil, 2012  was a watershed article for a fairly newly defned  feld  while newly defned, it was certainly not new in practice for the most    part . It is one of the best descriptions of what a data scientist does, what    backgrounds they typically have and their career aspirations and the projected    career opportunities. However, at the same time there is an unclear mixing    and comingling of terms that include analytics, advanced analytics, big data,      quants, analysts, statisticians, programmers, and computer scientists. One of  our objectives in this book is to help the common reader parse through arti- cles like this and have an appreciation for the overlap as well as the separation.   WHO KNEW STATISTICS WAS SEXY?   Hal Varian, the chief economist at Google, put it this way: “I keep say- ing the sexy job in the next ten years will be statisticians. People think  I’m joking, but who would’ve guessed that computer engineers would’ve  been the sexy job of the 1990s?”   What do the polls say on Data Science, AI, and Analytics related jobs?   While AI and analytics related jobs are too granular to make a lot of polls,  we looked at Glassdoor and U.S. News & World Report and see from these  sources that data scientists, statisticians, and other related professionals are  ranked as follows:         1  Data scientists. Glassdoor  www.glassdoor.com  , a very popular site,     placed data scientist as the 1 job for 4 years in a row in their 50 Best  Jobs in America Report. For the 2019 report the Job Score was 4.7 5,  Job Satisfaction rating was 4.3 5 and a median base salary of US$108K.  Data engineer was ranked 8 in the 2019 report.

McKinsey  2011  estimated there would be a shortage of  talent necessary for organizations to take advantage of big data:   By 2018, the United States alone could face a shortage of 140,000  to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills as well as 1.5 million  managers and analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of  big data to make effective decisions.   We do not know at this time how accurate this forecast was, but we do  know that big data related careers are in demand more than ever. And, it is  very important to know that McKinsey puts an emphasis on managers and    16  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective  decisions. This is very important as many think it will be the hard-core data  practitioners that will be affected by these changes. But, in reality, all pro- fessionals will ultimately be affected. All work processes, patient, customer  and citizen engagements, and interactions will change. It will be extremely  pervasive and professionals wanting to stay relevant will need a basic under- standing of AI, data science and analytics.   A Google search of “analytics jobs” returned 867 million results on   7 7 19. Indeed.com, a popular website for job hunters, returned 158K jobs  on the same day for an “analytics” query  United States . Glassdoor.com  returned 455K results for the same query. SimplyHired.com returned 116K  and Monster.com returned 69K. Needless to say, there are many analytics  jobs available. However if you look at job postings for hospital administrator,  sales executive representative, customer service manager, human resource  manager, feet manager, marketing coordinator, and restaurant manager,  you will see many of them have some reference to analytics in the job  description as desired qualifcations and if they don’t they likely will in the  near future. These are jobs that are well removed from the highly technical  demands of AI engineers or career data scientists, but professionals seeking  these jobs need some basic knowledge of the subjects. So, you don’t have  to be a quantitative thinker to beneft from these burgeoning felds. In fact,  Thomas Davenport, who is credited with popularizing the term “analytics,”  states that important qualifcations for the feld are hybrid skill sets including  communicator and trusted advisor.   And, since employers are having a hard time flling the roles, they are  becoming very fexible with employee schedules, locations, and pay. For  example, companies turn to satellite offces to strengthen their bid for talent.  For those looking to hire data science and analytics talent, it’s no secret that  the location of your data science team can help or hinder your hiring results.  Burtch Works  2019  reported they had seen many companies opening satel- lite offces in multiple urban areas to increase their role’s marketability.   Because of this explosive growth and need for software platforms, con-  sultants and professionals in all areas of data science, there is a lot of media  coverage of all forms. There are many magazine articles, white papers,  blogs, webinars, YouTube videos, websites, social media posts and media of  all forms that are ripe with sensationalism and misinformation  some of  this is referred to as marketecture . We present examples of these through- out the book in our Hype, Fear, and Intrigue vs Reality introductory     sections of each chapter. It is one of the main themes of the book          You Need This Book  ◾  17           to separate fact from fction and educate the reader on the various ways the  business, healthcare and government sectors can beneft from using data to  transform decision and execution processes.   Where Is Someone to Turn for Information?   It is very common to turn to online sources of information, and this takes a  variety of forms. We dive into some of these and discuss the strengths and  weaknesses of them. Print media, websites and blogs, education and training  programs and corporate programs are some typical sources of information  for both seasoned pros and newcomers to gather information.   Books, magazines, and newspapers are sometimes useful sources of   information. Unfortunately, magazines and newspapers have to push sen- sational headlines and titles that are often biased, and motivated more by  selling issues than reporting objective facts. We will look at many of them  in this book. Books are much more objective. However, there are dozens  of books on coding, programming, applying techniques and methods, to  problems via very specifc subjects like logistic regression or convolutional  networks, then there are on the broader issues related to analytics and data  science. We saw a real need to present these topics at a more foundational  level and thus we are attempting to fll this need by writing this book.   Websites and blogs contain some useful information, but these sources  are often skewed either intentionally or unintentionally. Often, the authors  on these sites have a vested interest in promoting particular software, plat- forms or techniques and therefore their content pushes this perspective. Or,  they are trained in a narrow space and promote that knowledge as the best  option when it may not be the optimal discipline for the problem at hand.  There are a growing number of technical training options available that   include full-time, part-time, on-campus degree programs, online degree pro- grams, boot camps, Massively Open Online Courses  MOOCs , workshops  and online tutorials and forums. But, most of all these are very technical or  geared to a particular feld like statistics or data science. And, if you decide  to pursue detailed education or a change in career, how do you determine  which program or feld is best suited to your interests and skills? Most of  the courses offered by the major platforms  Coursera, University Adult  Extensions, etc.  are “analytics focused.”   Internal promotion of analytics programs and corporate training has   proven there is a need, but also a gap in success. Not from a techni- cal perspective, but we think the “gap in success” is in the big picture, an    18  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     understanding of the overarching landscape. This is evidenced in an article  note  Press, Forbes, January 2017  that confrms the initiation of these pro- grams, but a poor success rate:   More than 85% of respondents report that their frms have started  programs to create data-driven cultures, but only 37% report suc- cess thus far… Technology is not the problem. The culprits include  management understanding, organizational alignment and general  organizational resistance. “If only people were as malleable as  data,” say the authors of the NVP report.   It is not that technology is hampering success. It is people’s understanding  and acceptance of these technologies. This is exactly why you need this  book. We provide a framework – what are the most important data-driven  technologies and more importantly, what are the most important practiced  methods and felds to solve problems. And we offer this in a non-mathemat- ical, non-technical manner.   WHY READ THIS BOOK? SOME REASONABLE QUESTIONS   A reasonable question: “We have software companies  come into our workplace and they provide technology  presentations; why not use the information they present?”  Software companies have a unique view of this sector that is biased by  the products they sell. It is therefore a limited view of the space to the  areas to the cover with their solutions. For example, if it is a Visual BI  company they will often present their products as solutions to problems  that are not the best ft. This is not a criticism of these companies. It is  understandable. They know their solutions well and they may solve many  of the problems. However, is it the optimal way to solve the problem?  Microsoft Excel can solve thousands and thousands of problems. But is it  the most effective and effcient tool for many of these problems?   This book is presented at a higher level. We will not be speaking to  any specifc software, discipline, application or industry. Instead, we will  present an introduction to the broad sector much as you would receive  in an introductory 101 college class. Not a methods or application pre- sentation. Not a full history course. But a survey course; a course treating  briefy the chief topics of a broad feld of knowledge.    You Need This Book  ◾  19           A REASONABLE QUESTION: “WE HAVE SOLUTION  CONSULTANTS THAT COME IN AND NEGOTIATE SERVICES;  WHY NOT GET THIS INFORMATION FROM THEM?”  Professional  service  companies  typically  partner  with  a  few  vendors,  apply  a  few  technologies  and  are  biased  based  on  these  agreements  and tools. That is not to say that at times they don’t attempt to be open- minded, it is just a constraint of time and most of these professionals are  “in the weeds,” meaning by the nature of their job they have to under- stand the deep detail of technologies they are employing very well and at  a very detailed level. This often prevents them from seeing the landscape  because of the nature of their work. Again, we address this at a higher  level. We are not attached to any particular school or methodology.   A REASONABLE QUESTION: “AREN’T THERE A LOT OF  BOOKS ON AI, DATA SCIENCE, AND ANALYTICS?”  Yes, there are. But most of these are about using tools for open source  platforms like Python, R, Java, Scala and many others. Some are avail- able  for  commercial  software  platforms.  Some  are  application  specifc  like  e-commerce  analytics,  healthcare  quality  and  performance,  claim  fraud  prevention,  trade  policy  analysis,  customer  loyalty retention,  AI  for Internet retail. These are very specifc. There are methodology and  history  texts  on  statistics,  operations  research,  mathematical  program- ming, and others. Other books are written for particular subjects within  mathematics and engineering. You can fnd classical or Bayesian statis- tics books, operations research, decision science and most of the topics  we cover, but these books cover the subject in a very detailed manner.  Again, we are offering a survey or topical view of the entire analytics  and data science landscape so we cover many of the topics that are in- between and above what is covered by these texts, especially the process  and organizational importance within successful programs.   A REASONABLE QUESTION: “AREN’T THERE GOOD DEGREE  PROGRAMS FOR AI, DATA SCIENCE, AND ANALYTICS?”  Yes, there are and we recommend them. There are on campus programs  which  offer  the  beneft  of  getting  to  know  your  professors  and  fellow  students more intimately. The bonds are stronger, you get a deeper col- legial experience and the personal nature of these programs allows you    20  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     to engage in the emotional and softer side of an in-person engagement  where you can better read tone and emotion. However, these programs  require some overhead. The commute time back and forth to campus.  You cannot capture some information as quickly, such as screen capture  of  lectures,  as  you  can  with  an  online  program,  unless  the  university  technology  allows  for  it,  but  typically  not.  All  programs  are  time  con- strained in that they offer a small set of courses and those taught on- campus are likely to be even more constrained since these courses are  more expensive for a university to cover.   Online programs are great in that you can access some of the best uni- versities in the world from your home. You have very little overhead in  that you do not have to commute, leave your home or even get dressed!   Unless  your  program  requires  you  to  have  your  web  cam  turned  on,  which some do.  From our experience, the relationships between profes- sor and student, as well as student to student, are much weaker in these  courses. One proof point is that group projects work fairly well in on- campus situations and we have seen some fail online, even though one  would think the opposite.   And  of  course,  these  programs  take  a  signifcant  time  investment,  approximately  four  years  for  undergraduate  degrees  and  two  years  for  graduate programs. As with most things in life it depends on your objec- tives  and  constraints   decision  science  and  optimization  are  upcoming  topics that may help you make decisions . The authors have previously  and  continue  to  teach  in  degree  granting  institutions,  and  have  done  so both on-campus and online  Your coauthor, Gary Miner, prefers the  online situation for most teaching situations, and fnds that individual stu- dents communicate both with other students and with the professor via  both the “Course Communication Message Boards” and even direct email  to the professor, with the format and “class culture” that Gary shepherds .   A REASONABLE QUESTION: “AREN’T THERE GOOD BOOT  CAMPS FOR AI, DATA SCIENCE, AND ANALYTICS?”  Yes,  but  as  alluded  to  earlier,  these  are  highly  specifc  and  technical.  Most are specifc to learning some basics of data science, but most of the  time is learning a specifc open-source or freemium  a combination of  the words “free” and “premium” used to describe a business model that  offers both free and premium services  coding language or languages like  R, Python, Scala, SQL, Cloud-based ML, and commercial trial software.    You Need This Book  ◾  21           They offer nuts and bolts of ML problem types and algorithms used to  solve  different  problems,  and  much  time  is  devoted  to  programming.  They do not cover process and organizational elements or subjects from  a holistic view.   These programs are worthwhile if you need to learn specifc skills or  get up to speed very quickly. They focus on directions. Some are very  good, some are poor and most are expensive so choose wisely.   The costs of these boot camps are highly variable, but can be very  expensive  for  in-person  full-time  immersive  camps  with  one  provider  charging  US$4,000  for  a  1-week  course  and  another  charging  up  to  US$17,600 for a 12-week class.   Let us contrast boot camps and degree programs.   BOOT CAMPS   ◾  Initially  focused  primarily  on  programming,  but  they  eventually    extended into other felds that have a programming component like  “Data Science”   ◾  Educational Prerequisites: vary widely  anywhere from basic knowl-   edge of math and programming to completion of Ph.D.-level studies    ◾  Admission Process: resume, interviews, admission tests    ◾  Instruction: Intensive, in-person courses, taught by practicing data     scientists   ◾  Duration: Typically, between 6 weeks and 3 months    ◾  Cost: Usually higher cost than self-study courses, but generally lower     cost than tradition MS degree programs  free to US$21,000    ◾  Attendance:  Often  requires  dedicated  full-time,  in-person  atten-   dance; students must reside within close geographical proximity to  the site of instruction   ◾  Outcome: Portfolio of projects, enhanced network; Many boot camps     also offer job search assistance   ◾  Examples:  Insight  Data  Science,  Metis  Data  Science  Boot  camp,    Zipfan  Academy,  Data  Incubator,  General  Assembly,  NYC  Data  Science Academy, Level boot camp   DEGREE PROGRAMS   ◾  Educational Prerequisites: vary widely  anywhere from basic knowl-   edge of math and programming to completion of undergraduate or  graduate studies in applied math and or computer science     22  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     ◾  Admission  Process:  application,  offcial  transcripts  from  previously    attended colleges and universities, reference letters, statement of pur- pose letter  of  intent,  resume curriculum  vitae,  challenge entrance  exam, interviews, Graduate Record Examination  GRE  or other aca- demic test scores   ◾  Instruction:  Research  degrees:  often  taught  by  full-time  university    faculty; Professional degrees: frequently taught by part-time univer- sity-level instructors who are also practicing data scientists   ◾  Duration: Typically, between 9 and 20 months    ◾  Cost: US$20,000 to US$70,000    ◾  Attendance:  Full-time  and  part-time  options  available;  in-person    attendance generally required, but there are an increasing number  of online options available  i.e., students increasingly do not need to  live within close physical proximity to the university college    ◾  Outcome:  Portfolio  of  projects,  enhanced  professional  network;     degree   ◾  Examples: UC Berkeley School of Information’s  I School  Master of    Information and Data Science  MIDS , Northwestern SPS Master’s in  Data  Science   Online ,  Northwestern  University  Master  of  Science  in Analytics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Master of  Computer Science in Data Science  MCS-DS , NYU Master of Science  in Data Science, University of Washington Master of Science in Data  Science,  City  University  New  York   CUNY   School  of  Professional  Studies, Master of Science in Data Science  previously MS in Data  Analytics    A REASONABLE QUESTION: “AREN’T THERE WEB PROGRAMS  LIKE COURSERA, EDX, UDEMY, UDACITY AND OTHER  MOOCS FOR AI, DATA SCIENCE, AND ANALYTICS?”      These courses are less expensive than boot camps and degree pro- grams. At the same time, they are not normally recognized or rewarded  in industry. Completion of material and testing of competency are some- times not validated by carriers of these programs and therefore profes- sional organizations and employers do not give them as much credit as  the  other  educational  options  previously  presented.  They  can  be  time  based so essentially staying on a screen for a required time is all that  is  necessary  for  completion  and  no  tutorials  having  to  be  completed.    You Need This Book  ◾  23           However, quality levels of the programs differ and some do offer test- ing for module or course competency and some offer capstone projects  that are reviewed by instructors. One of the authors did take a Big Data  MOOC and found it benefcial, but he was not looking for it to increase  the odds of landing a job or a career enhancement, but instead it was for  self-education of a specifc topic where he wanted to gain a better under- standing. In-person boot camps and degree programs offer networking  and collegial interaction with other students where MOOCs typically do  not. So, the main advantage of a MOOC is the price point when a student  wants a specifc area of study to focus on.   A REASONABLE QUESTION: “CAN’T I JUST DO  AN INTERNET SEARCH FOR THIS MATERIAL  INSTEAD OF GETTING A BOOK?”  You can do a search for many of the terms in this book, however you    will not fnd the framework for analytics and beyond on the Internet. You  will  not  fnd  the  contrasts,  the  distinguishing  features  nor  our  unique  perspective  that  has  been  developed  with  a  combined  experience  of  over ffty years applying the trade. And, “you don’t know what you don’t  know.”  The Internet is great for two things. The frst is looking up  something specifc to your interest. An example is “what is a convolution  network?”  Another  is  getting  someone’s  expertise  on  a  narrow  subject  such as reading a blog or listening to a podcast. The authors will recom- mend some suggestions on where to fnd this material on the Internet.  But, this is supplementary material and meant as an aside, not the core  framework we are presenting here.      Additionally, there is a lot of misinformation spread on the Internet.  Unfortunately, something can be incorrect, but is referenced as true over  and over again, and thus grows into a mutated beast like out of a horror  flm.  One  of  the  authors'  favorites  was  that  it  took  22,000  crunches  to  burn a pound of fat. It was supposedly reported in Men’s Health in 2012.  And while we have tried very hard to fnd the original citation, you can  fnd hundreds of articles and blogs on the Internet that cite it as fact. And  the Men’s Health website even cites itself  Ballantyne, 2012  in a May 1,  2012 article. We have looked for a credible source and have been unable  to fnd one. What are the assumptions? Is this above basal metabolism? If  it was above basal metabolism then it would make it more believable, as       24  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     if you could do 20 crunches per minute, nonstop it would take you over  eighteen hours!!! But most people would burn several hundred calories in  eighteen hours just by sitting in a chair. So where is the truth here?   And, the Internet is not the only place for misinformation. One of the  author’s favorite stories that spread even in the scientifc community is  that  spinach  is  a  good  source  of  iron.  We  believed  this  until  recently   Scott had even suggested eating more spinach to his wife to improve her  iron count , because it has been reported, and we also remembered that  this is what made Popeye strong! But, if you look at a can of spinach it  does not contain very much iron. The problem? The misconception was  spun over and over, reported again and again. The real problem began  with a 19th-century researcher who misplaced a decimal in its calcula- tion of iron content. This has cycled back and forth. From what we can  surmise now, cooked spinach is a good source of iron, but raw spinach  is not. We will let you do your own research on this subject  Dove, 2019;  and Tang, 2018 .   But, feel comfortable that we have done considerable research on the   material in the following chapters of this book.   In this book you will not get a narrow focus; instead you will get  a reference that can be used for years. You will also get an objec- tive view. Almost everything the Internet provides contains some sort of  bias. Someone trying to sell something or get a click from someone. We  are objective enough to know that we are biased, but not commercially  biased. We are not trying to sell you anything, other than this book! We  are biased by our limitations of time and exposure and affnity to like  certain things, but that is much more objective than you will fnd from a  search reading a blog or listening to a podcast.   This book used correctly will accelerate and expand your knowledge  of a very rich feld. Rather than approaching the subject from a narrow or  haphazard view you can approach it holistically.   A REASONABLE QUESTION: “WITH THE ADVENT  OF NEW AI TECHNOLOGIES, CAN’T WE IGNORE  ALL THESE OTHER METHODS??”  We  will  need  the  contributions  of  a  variety  of  disciplines  for  many  decades.  It  is  not  a  new  phenomenon  that  when  new   or  reinvented   technologies come into vogue that the experts and pundits call for the    You Need This Book  ◾  25           death of existing technology. One brash example is made in the forward  of  Computational  Intelligence  in  Business  Analytics   2014 ,  a  quote  by  Michelle Chamber, pages ix-xi:      This  era  of  computational  intelligence  is  about  to  make  all  of  the  accomplishments by the baby boomers obsolete.   What a bold and incorrect statement. For one, most of the contribu- tions covered in the book were developed by baby boomers  Fuzzy Sets,  Artifcial  Neural  Networks,  Genetic  Algorithms,  Neuro-Fuzzy  Systems .  These are not new; they are rediscovered due to computational power  and savvy practitioners. Recently, there has been pushback against black- box models which lack transparency. Most AI methods are not readily  transparent.  This  pushback  is  two-fold.  First  the  fnancial  collapse  of  2008  is  largely  due  to  the  lack  of  transparency  of  the  model’s  fnan- cial frms were using. Secondly, there is a social pushback is occurring  against  these  black  box  models.  An  example  of  this  is  General  Data  Protection Regulation  GDPR  that started in the United Kingdom, but is  being adopted in various forms across the globe.   Furthermore,  the  “death  of  statistics”  has  been  predicted  for  several  years. Statistics is not going away; it has one of the longest histories and  will be around for decades. However, there are shortcomings in statistics,  just as there are with every method in this book. Our goal is to shine  a light on the advantages as well as the shortcomings of these various  methods. And to illustrate where which tool is right for the job.   The Problem, Too Many Self-Interests:  The Need for an Objective View   The authors have been collaborating on the ideas in this book for years. We  met while working together in the software and technology sector. Each of  us has a background in statistics, ML, analytics, healthcare and more. We  noticed that while the products and solutions in the AI, Data Science, and  Analytics space offered tremendous value, there was a great deal of misun- derstanding of the terminology in and around this space. Furthermore, we  noticed a lot of “reinvention” of methods that existed for years, meaning that  in this “reinvention” many of the same concepts, processes and techniques    26  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     acquired new names, thus adding to confusion, especially when attempting  to communicate among different disciplines.   We will dig deep into these felds. But, a couple of quick examples to   illustrate our point:         1. AI has been around for over 60 years. It began at a workshop at  Dartmouth College called the Dartmouth AI Conference of 1956   Dartmouth, 2019; Wikipedia, 2019a . Lisp was created as a special  computer language to do AI in the 1950s  The 2nd author of this book,  Gary Miner, used LISP during his graduate and post-doctoral work . AI  had a major resurrection in the 1980s and companies built specialized  Lisp machines and the frst so-called “expert systems.” We will discuss  this in greater detail in the chapter on AI  Chapter 7 . But, if you were  to read the popular press or trade journals you would think that AI is a  new technology that is revolutionizing the world. It may revolutionize  the world, but that has more to do with recent acceptance and advance- ments in computing power and algorithms. The foundations of AI are  not new, but emphasizing the word “AI” sells.         2. We will see that Data Mining and ML are very closely aligned in a dedi- cated chapter. However, the term Data Mining is rarely used anymore. It  fell out of vogue, why? Simply put, money.   Marketing and sales are about generating new revenue and it is not sexy  to sell existing technology with the “old, known name.” Technologists also  think that they need to put their mark on extensions and revisions of exist- ing technology. But often these “new marks or revisions” are 90% existing  technology and thus it gets branded with a new name. No wonder things  are confusing. AI is a little different in that the basic term has not changed,  but the meaning has changed quite a bit. In the end, we must reinvent  and remarket to sell technology. We must reinvent and remarket to extend  our careers. We understand the drivers for reinvention, but it is confusing.  Especially to people just getting started. Is there really a difference between  data science and statistics? Is there really anything substantially different that  a “data scientist” and a “statistician” do in their jobs?   For brevity, when we are not explicitly writing about a particular domain    AI, data science, ML, etc. , but we choose to use the term “analytics”  as a broad and general term for the overarching domain. We have  witnessed companies of all sizes and industries gain tremendous value from  applying analytic methods and technologies. We know there are companies    You Need This Book  ◾  27           of all shapes and sizes that are beginning their journey. We know many  others that have deep roots, but in an applied area and cannot see the “big  picture” and know of technologies outside their immediate use. We know  there are those that struggle with a constantly changing sea of terms and  technology. We know some are scared for what they don’t know, what they  are not doing, what they should be doing. Everyone is moving at a million  miles an hour and companies are worried they might lose their advantage in  a competitive market and need something quickly, either with analytics or  to expand with some other nascent technology. However, it is time to take a  step back. To survey the landscape and synthesize it.   With pause, we can view the analytics domain holistically.   FOUR PERSONAS OR AVATARS THAT      WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS BOOK      Sandy Templeton just got another email from her boss, Ron Liu.  Ron is the CEO of a large hospital system and Sandy is the COO report- ing to him. Ron is well connected with other large health systems and  is a voracious reader of strategy and business journals like the Harvard    Business Review. He has been pushing Sandy for the last several years to  get on board with tech trends. First, it was analytics. Now it is more data  science and AI. Sandy knows their system is under pressure from market  and technological forces. And Ron not only feels behind his peers, he is  now getting a lot of pressure from the board to adopt advances in analyt- ics, data science, and AI. Sandy is worried for her job, moreover her entire  career. She is not keeping up with the trends. She kept hearing about  analytics, recently it was data science and now everything she hears is  AI. She has implemented some corporate dashboards and everyone loves  them, but she is feeling that the competition is way ahead. Now, her boss  is after her as well. She reads trade journals, business magazines, blogs,  but feels she does not understand the terminology and how everything  fts together. She has technology companies and consultants come in, but  they always seem to be peddling their own wares. She wishes there was  an objective view that she could read and understand the fundamental  landscape  of  where  they  are  and  where  they  should  be  headed.  This    book is for her.   Pete  Samper  is  a  mayor  for  a  large  city  in  California,  a  state  that  leads  technology  in  the  United  States.  Pete  has  read  about  some    28  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     progressive cities using analytics and statistics to bring about data-driven  policy change. He is proud of his state and wants to bring his city into  the 21st century using some of the same techniques that have lead many  of the businesses in his state. He is anxious because he does not know  how to accomplish his goals. He has contacted several consultants, but  they are expensive and seem to provide a limited view. He has thought  of taking some classes, but traditional university education would take  too long. There are a variety of online classes, MOOCs, but these are  technical and specifc to certain technologies. He wants “to know what  he should know” about the fundamentals of all this stuff. He wants an  objective view of the landscape. He does not have the time, nor desire to  get into the weeds; he has staff for that. This book is for him.                        Rajiv Gupta is Chief Analytics Offcer for BuyItHere.com. He    has  had  a  meteoric  rise  to  this  position.  He  started  fresh  out  of  high  school as a junior designer developing creative content for the web site.  A couple of jobs later he was performing analytics on creative, marketing  campaigns and click-through analytics. Now he is leading the charge as a  CAO doing predictive analytics with ML and AI. He has been working on  very specifc e-commerce problems for his entire career. He is at a point  that he would like to broaden his knowledge to related disciplines and  methodologies to problems outside the e-commerce sphere. He wants to  speak intelligently. He wants to expand his scope and enter into another  type of business. He feels limited in his knowledge outside of Internet  retail.  He  is  a  data  scientist,  using  some  of  the  most  cutting-edge  and  novel techniques  AI, Neural Nets . However, he knows there are other  domains  like  dashboards,  data  visualization,  BI,  statistics,  operations  research,  and  mathematical  programming.  This  book  is  written  for  Rajiv.   Tom Stiles is a pricing  data  scientist and currently works for  a  software  company.  He  is  very  knowledgeable  about  his  company  products and the types of pricing solutions they offer to solve specifc  problems on pricing and revenue optimization. Previously, he was a pro- fessional services consultant working with clients on distributed comput- ing systems. Tom is considering a career change and wants to know more  about data analytics, ML and AI. He did have a couple of statistics classes  in college and would like to know more about careers in statistics as well  as optimization and decision science. This book is for Tom.    You Need This Book  ◾  29           There Are Many Other Professional Stories That  Are Concerned about Whether Analytics Is  Important; Here Are a Few More Examples   We have heard many fears and concerns from professionals over the last few  years about a lack of direction or knowledge on the topics outlined so far  in this book. In this and our two sequel books in this series, we are offer- ing answers to the following questions, which are paraphrased from actual  experience. Following is what we hope will be a representative sample.            2  I am a statistician, but looking at a salary survey it appears     1  I am in charge of informatics for a large enterprise. There seems    to be a dizzying variety of new technologies and methodologies coming  into use these days. Unfortunately, most of what I see comes from ven- dors and consultants. We had a guy tell us that dashboards were useless  and he wanted to sell us an AI platform with deep learning and convo- lutional networks and to replace my current staff with a data scientist   scrap the dashboards . Our dashboard initiatives have very successful:  management and the board like them. Another person wanted to sell us  some sort of auto ML platform that my current staff could use to create  predictive models. I know I need to make some changes, but I am not  sure that I am getting good advice. How can I get an objective view of  where things are and where they are headed?    that data scientists seem to make a lot more money and are in  higher demand. I have read some articles and blogs on data science  education. However, many of these seem to be pushing a specifc pro- gram, a boot camp or online program. There seems to be some overlap  or my training and what these programs offer and I am not sure these  programs are pushing open source whereas my company has a com- mercial platform that I have been using for statistics and I know we  can get modules for ML and AI. I just need to know more before I can  make a pitch to invest in these technologies. What are the real differ- ences between data science and statistics? What do I need to make a  successful pitch to add value for my company and broaden my career?    3  I am a BI developer. I work well with IT on sourcing the data, creat- ing relational cubes, designing reports and charts. But I want to expand  my capabilities. I know there is more that I can do to take what I have  created to the next level. What is the logical next step for me? What  techniques should I be considering learning?    30  ◾        It’s All Analytics!                    4  I am currently a web designer. I consider myself creatively and   5  AI is all the rage these days, I don’t get it, why? I remember       technically inclined, but I have never really liked math. I can code and  work on the backend with databases, and I am familiar with software  development methodologies  like scrum and agile . I want to expand  my horizons and I am considering some form of analytics or predic- tive analytics career. I know it would be benefcial to the goals of our  company, for our web strategy and therefore be an easy sell to manage- ment. But what about the long run? I may want to get out of this area  someday. Where else is it used? I don’t know what I don’t know.    How do I get started?    when I was a freshman in college in 1997 over twenty years ago    and Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov. My professor said that AI    had been around a long time, but this would be its new dawning    as computers got powerful and fast enough to harness it. A new AI      revolution was about to happen. Here we are twenty years later and  it seems I am reading the same headlines. How are we supposed to      believe what we read? I wish there was a source of information that  was not clickbait.    6  I have been an actuary for over ten years in a mid-sized insur- ance company and I have my FSA certifcation. In national meet- ings, many of the larger insurance companies and actuarial frms are  beginning to adopt ML methods. I have read in some posts. There  was one forum that posted “Blog: Is Machine Learning a Threat to the  Actuarial Profession?,” while another has the title “Machine Learning:  An Analytical Invitation to Actuaries.” This is confusing. Moreover, there  is deep learning, big data, and modern analytics. Should I invest time  researching these felds and if so, how? Where?    campaign testing for e-commerce and he tells me it is great. He says  what he does is basic statistics and it can be easily learned. He loves his  job and his company is investing in him, by sending him to additional  training in data analytics where he will learn some more advanced stats  and some data mining techniques. Where can I get basic, impartial  information about this and related information? Is it something I might  be interested in?    8  I hear social networking and graph analytics databases are hot  and getting hotter due to the rise in social media, fraud and naviga- tion systems. Is this real? If so, what skills would I need to into this   7  My friend works for an Internet company doing marketing    You Need This Book  ◾  31                       feld? What are the job titles and places that employ these types of  people?    9  I work for a large bank doing credit risk modeling for new  accounts. Basically, I assess risk based on data with predictive pre- scriptive analytics. I am wanting to make a career change to another  industry. I am considering getting into healthcare as I would really like  to make a difference and personally I think healthcare is broken. I  know there are lots of areas in the medical feld, but where can I use  my existing education and experience to its fullest while learning new  ones and applying them to new problems? What are analytic profession- als and statisticians doing in healthcare?    10  I love computers and software, but I also enjoy working with  people. I don’t want to be locked in the basement of some business  or chained to my desk. I want to get out of my offce and talk with  people. I want to work with others to solve problems together. I think  I have a lot I can teach others and I want to learn from them as well. I  read about data science careers, but they sound like they spend hours  and hours coding each day. Are there blended opportunities in analyt- ics where you have time to think deeply at times, but also meet and  engage others on projects?    a smart group, but we are just getting started with this and  we still have our full-time jobs. We have had a couple of infor- mal, almost serendipitous successes in the company last year. One was  reducing product returns; the other was increasing membership in our  rewards program. Leadership loves what we did and has challenged us  with implementing three new analytics projects this year. We are look- ing at projects and are realizing we need more structure around these  projects. Is there a project management method out there? Should we  use it or one of our IT development processes? Can I use our traditional  project management program? What project management process is  best for us?    doing analytics because our CEO likes graphic results presented  at our quarterly meeting. It is no mystery that our CEO loves the  way they determine their fndings. She is big in the harder, data-driven  results. I am in the fnance department and while I get we are data  driven, we are not the right kind of data driven for our CEO to pay  attention. I know we could do more with forecasting our numbers and   11  I have an ad-hoc group of “wanna-be” data scientists. We have   12  I know that my company’s sales and marketing department is    32  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     13  I am a project manager. I have been a project manager for years,   since she likes the sales and marketing forecasts, that would probably  resonate with her. What else could we do that would be more forward  looking? Our reports are static; is there a way to make them more  dynamic in nature? Also, we miss often miss our estimates and don’t  handle variability risk well as we swing positive or negative. How can  we get better with our estimates and how do we quantify the up down- side for our reports? I want our department to “fnd the love” that sales  and marketing gets from the top boss.    but I want to make a change to specialize in analytics projects. I need  to understand the overall feld and special considerations for managing  analytics projects. Where should I go?    Which should it be? AI? Statistics? BI?    15  My CEO went to national conference and has come back “on  fre” for analytics and AI. She has given me the responsibility for  bringing our company into the new age of analytics and AI, but I know  there is a lot I need to learn and I am confused by all the coverage.  I have to design a corporate strategy and architectural design for the  entire company. We have been successful in a couple of functional  areas, but how do I design for the entire organization?   14  I want to make a career switch into some sort of analytics.              Do any of the above sound familiar? Could you beneft from answers    to any of these questions? Or are you already convinced that you need    to know more? That you will be left behind or negatively impacted by a    biased or uninformed comprehension of the subject? Then keep reading.    This book will provide you the foundations of data-driven methodology.    It is written from a broad, curated knowledge and wisdom from authors    who have studied and practiced in a broad array of felds of study and    application. Additionally, we will offer a level deeper on applications in    our upcoming book  expected 2022  on The Applications of AI, Analytics,    and Data Science. And for those that will be designing and architect- ing you will want to get our upcoming book expected 2021 , Designing    an Integrated AI, Analytics and Data Science Architecture for Your    Organization.   We will cover many of these here and then go deeper in the intersection  of people, process and technology applied to analytics, data science, and AI.  We provide a holistic view of the space for professionals currently involved  in a dedicated area of limited scope, those seeking to enter and want to    You Need This Book  ◾  33           know what area most interests them, and those professionals that want to  know how these shifts in technology may affect their careers.   What This Book Is Not:   This is not an academic book. It is not a scholarly pursuit. This is not a  technical book or a programming book, and there are no complicated  mathematical equations in this book. It is not meant to be a daily practitio- ner’s step-by-step guide. It does not discuss low-level, nuts and bolts recipes  for producing ML models or applying these algorithms. It does not discuss  software vendors. This book is not complete. It is not written for a specialty  area, i.e., it is not an AI book, nor a statistics book, nor a BI book. Lastly, it  is not a history book.   Why This Book?   As stated previously, we have noticed a changing sea of terminology and  concepts. We know that much of this is generated by companies, technolo- gists, and consultants. We recognize software and technology have improved  greatly over time, but much has just been relabeled as well and there is  much confusion with leaders and practitioners. Without changing the names  of techniques, it is diffcult to sound innovative and fresh. Marketers, product  managers, and consultants are pushed to be more innovative, to differentiate  and to forge new horizons. We understand. However, we want to help pro- fessionals in the feld understand some of the underlying foundations, some  of the relationships and some ways to think about the subject.   Data Science – Data Analytics – Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics has     a wide range of specifc tools to solve problems.  Gary, one of the authors     solves these problems by subjecting a “cleaned up dataset” to many or      all of the tools in “Automatic Competitive Evaluations” that rapidly spit  out results that show which tool is most effective in analyzing a specifc    dataset  it is oftentimes diffcult to predict ahead of time which tool will      do the best job. If one works by trying “one tool at a time” an inordinate  amount of time is used  wasted , when we have available automatic “com- petitive evaluating software” to do this in seconds for us. When Gary gets    the “competitive evaluation” report he can look at what are indicated as      the “best tools” and then chose among them  there may be a reason for    34  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     a particular dataset not to use one tool, when another tool that is more    appropriate for specifc type of data is shown to be equally or almost    equally effective in analyzing that dataset  for further modeling. MORAL    OF STORY: Do not act in “isolation” – e.g. do not have a bias toward any    one tool, as if one does, you may miss the most important information that    can be obtained from your data.   Sure, Business, but Why Healthcare,  Public Policy, and Business?   Professionals are challenged each day by a changing landscape of technol- ogy and terminology. In recent history, especially the last 25 years, there has  been an explosion of terms and methods born that automate and improve  decision-making and operations. One term, “Analytics,” is an overarching  description of a compilation of methodologies. But AI, statistics, decision sci- ence, and optimization, which have been around for decades, have resurged.  Also, things like BI, Online Analytical Processing  OLAP  and many, many  more have been born or reborn.   How is someone to make sense of all this methodology, terminology?  That is why we created the Analytics Landscape. Even the title was  diffcult. How do you describe the intent in a few words that encompass  terminology and practices of a wide feld of methodology and practice? After  30 years in the space, in many industries and academic studies, the authors  want to help the modern practitioner.   These techniques and technologies have been embraced by consumer-  based businesses for years.   Healthcare has come later to the party and policy is just arriving.  We know there is a real need for the application of these techniques in   all forms of medicine and government.   That is why we wanted to specifcally call them out.  Here are just a few ways that innovative companies are applying the sci-  ence in the healthcare domain:   ◾  Improving diagnostic accuracy and effciently predicting dis-    eases. AI image processing, recognition, and classifcation for radiology  scans of all types  x-ray, CT, MRI, PET  are having a huge impact on  healthcare and will accelerate in the coming years. AI can learn train on  tens of millions of images and augment the intelligence of radiologists    You Need This Book  ◾  35           and other care providers – something a human can never do in an  entire lifetime.   ◾  Training for healthcare providers will become more dynamic     and interactive. Video games with avatar intelligence enabled by  AI are part of training new surgeons. This training, sometimes in the  form of “Games for surgeons,” but also surgical robots and data mining   Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics  will probably be making a differ- ence in healthcare delivery sooner than later  Smith, 2017    ◾  Data science is enabling precision medicine, medical care     designed to optimize effciency or therapeutic beneft for particular  groups of patients, especially by using genetic or molecular profling   precision medicine . This will radically change the benefts of drugs  and treatments.   ◾  Virtual assistance for patients. This can radically change the process    of treating patients. AI-assisted chatbots and intelligent agents can allay  the costly in-person offce visit as an initial consult and will greatly  reduce costs. Subsequent needed interactions can be made after most of  the data is collected, processed and enhanced by ML algorithms.   ◾  Computer-assisted language processing  text analytics, texting    mining, which we explore in depth later  can scan millions of physi- cian notes and text in EMR EHR databases and learn train from these  instances. This is assisting providers with diagnoses and treatment  options.   ◾  Intelligent robots. Advances in robotic surgery let doctors perform     many types of complex procedures with more precision, fexibility and  control than is possible with other conventional techniques.   ◾  Chronic disease management and population health specialists are     applying everything from visual analytics to predictive analytics to  make them more effective in providing access and information at the  appropriate time.   ◾  Health insurance claims are mined to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse     to more effectively distribute risk pool and insurance monies.   There are many, many more ways that data science, AI and analytics can  solve problems in healthcare and we will discuss some of these in this  book, and they will form more than a third of our upcoming book on  detailed applications.   At the same time, the bulk of medical practice has not changed in over  100 years. The basic processes of the medical examination of physician to       36  ◾        It’s All Analytics!        patient are the same as they were in the early 20th century. Yes, medical  technology, pharmacology, and medical education have improved greatly.    Nevertheless, much of medicine is practiced the same as it was a century  ago. A physician interviews a patient, takes a few  very high level  diagnos- tics like blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature, and hears the patient  describe the reason they are there. Most typically, the patient is prescribed  a drug that was formulated for the general population, not their genetic  make-up and both parties part and hope it works out. That is very much  the same as it has been for many years. Is there not a better way?         We are not medical experts, but almost every process improves over time  and often for the better. We think there is a huge opportunity in healthcare  for improvement by adopting more data-driven techniques and technology.  This book is applicable to all of the following professions as they are all  impacted by AI, data science and analytics:   administrators   healthcare consultants   munity care centers   ◾  Healthcare and hospital executives, chief medical offcers  CMOs  and     ◾  Medical professionals including physicians, nurses, clinicians, and     ◾  Healthcare professionals in hospitals, medical groups, clinics, and com-    ◾  Data analysts, medical informatics analysts, and technical professionals    ◾  Health science, public health, pharma, and life science providers    ◾  Public health, nursing, biology, informatics and other related majors     seeking careers in healthcare analytics   Additionally, if you are interested in a career in data-driven medicine  consider “Harnessing the Power of Data in Health,” a report by Stanford  Medicine  Stanford Medicine, 2017 . Also, the website for UCI where both  authors have affliations and teach a couple of courses in Healthcare  Analytics  UCI, 2019: https:  ce .uci. edu a reas  healt hcare  heal thcar e_ana lytic    s  . These two links are good sources of careers in the healthcare feld.  Even, The Centers for Medicare & Medicare Services  CMS , the payer of  more US$1.4 trillion of national healthcare expenditures in the United States,  is getting into AI. CMS offered an AI competition in 2019 with up to a  US$1.65M payout to competitors  www.cmschallenge.ai  .      Policy and government is a huge and wide feld. We feel that at the very     least, policy development should follow a system of testing and continu-   ous improvement. This system at its root focuses on cycling a four step    You Need This Book  ◾  37           process – Plan, Do, Study, Act  see Deming circle cycle wheel, in The New    Economics by Deming: Deming, 2018 . In the United States, we tend to pass    large, very expensive initiatives with inadequate testing and accountability.    What if legislation was piloted and be required to prove effcacious results      before being expanded? This would not be that diffcult! Instead of passing    a US$200 million dollar legislative bill, you pass a US$10 million pilot with  4 criteria to prove results. If these are met then you roll out the rest step of    the program and as part of the program, certain criteria have to be met for    continuation. This is how successful consumer and healthcare businesses    are run. Plan, execute, measure, expand, govern, amend, rinse and    repeat.   As an example, as we wrote this chapter, then presidential candidate   Andrew Yang was proposing a “Freedom Dividend” of US$1000 per month  for every adult over the age of 18. We take no position whether this is a  good or bad idea. However, if passed in full it would be expensive  estimate  US$2.4 trillion per year  and the big question is, “would it achieve the objec- tives?” According to Yang’s website  www.yang2020.com policies the-free    dom-dividend   the objective is:                           This would enable all Americans to pay their bills, educate them- selves, start businesses, be more creative, stay healthy, relocate for  work, spend time with their children, take care of loved ones, and  have a real stake in the future.   How would you measure its success?   Again, we are not taking a side, only pointing out this example as one   that is too often followed.   In general, governmental programs and policies at all levels, city, county,   state and federal, lack defnition and guidelines. There are too often:   ◾  No clear objectives to be obtained; often very vague    ◾  There is no measurement for success    ◾  They continue without review     By adopting a more data-driven methodology, a statistical methodology in  this case, the process would look more like the following framework:        1  What is the policy objective?  2  What quantifable outcomes would be measured?         38  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     NOTE: this is where many people suggest that not all outcomes can   be quantifed. We recommend referring to How to Measure Anything:  Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business  see Hubbard, 2010  which  applies to objectives in healthcare and government.   3  Plan a pilot project. This would require specifcs, for example:     a.  What are the objectives of the plan to be studied?  b.  What metrics would collected and by what method of collection?  c.  What are the criteria for success? What benchmarks must the metrics          d.  What is the sample for the pilot – location or subset of the popula-     surpass?   tion to test objectives?   e.  What is the period for evaluation, specifc dates?    f.  What is the method of analysis, experimental design plan?    g.  Who compares results to targets, presentation format and to what     body?   h.  What is the plan for termination or expansion?                            Obviously, there are many details in such a framework. But similar pro- cesses are used by the most successful companies in the world. Why not  government?   NEXT-GENERATION MEDICAL DEVICES   – HUMAN ENHANCEMENT   There is a push to augment human profciency with ML and AI. It is tak- ing new forms. Here are three examples:   Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, is investing US$100 mil- lion into a somewhat secretive venture called Neuralink that will employ  some of the leading scientists to create a brain to device network. This  news was announced in the summer of 2019. Musk said the Neuralink  system would allow for a chip to be implanted into the brains of willing  subjects and would allow humans to achieve “symbiosis with AI.”   Athletic performance is greatly being affected by the Internet of Things   IoT  where streaming information is available for training, performance,  and strategy. Athletic suits can be worn and sets of sensors can model  action and movement, other sets can be used for monitoring cardiac out- put and physical stress. These can be used to maximize training and even  formulate  strategies  using  AI  and  optimization.  Football,  MMA   mixed  martial arts  and virtually any deep pocket sport are evaluating such uses.    You Need This Book  ◾  39           AI and IoT are also helping gain freedom from disabilities. Whether it is  assisting veterans to walk again or helping the blind see, these technolo- gies are enhancing humans. One example is a new app that Microsoft  launched in 2018 called “Seeing AI.” It helps people who are blind or with  other visual disabilities interact with the world by using the smartphone’s  camera; the phone will audibly describe what it is seeing, read written  documents, scan product barcodes and even recognize faces  Microsoft,  2018; Bureau of Internet Accessibility, 2018 . Even things like the Apple- enabled “Siri” allow people with spinal cord injuries and inability to use  their hands to dial a phone number, communicate with others by speak- ing to their smart phone and verbally telling it who to call – just with a  voice command. Microsoft in Australia appears to be a leader in advanc- ing AI and IoT: Globally there are 1.3 billion people dealing with disabil- ity needing some kind of AI   IoT support. Of this 1.3 billion worldwide  number, about 4 million are Australians, and thus Deloitte in Australia  has estimated there is a market worth about US$1.4 billion by 2020 just  for Australia  Microsoft, April 2019 .   How This Book Is Organized   As readers, we love to see what is in store. Time is limited so let us explore  what the rest of this book offers.   Chapter 2: Building a Successful Program. We want to provide an   overview of what will make you successful in your journey. Things like  what pitfalls are out there, what should you be considering, and what  can thousands of hours  experienced by this book’s authors  in discus- sions of successes and failures provide you.   Chapter 3: Some Fundamentals – Process, Data, and Models. We     are covering many different programs, but there is an underlying theme.  Can we address some things that tie all these methods together? Yes,  please see this chapter.   Chapter 4: It’s All Analytics! Yes, be it data science or AI, statistics, or  reporting, it is all analytics and we cover the spectrum in this chapter.   Chapter 5: What Is Business Intelligence  BI  and Visual BI?     Where it starts and where it ends.    40  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Chapter 6: What Is Machine Learning and Data Mining? The RAGE   1.0 it had been getting a lot of press and it should; it can radically  change your life, probably already has. What you need to know.   Chapter 7: AI and How It Differs from Machine Learning. AI is the   Rage 2.0, but in many respects, it is the same.   Chapter 8: What Is Data Science? Yes, it is hot and will continue to be  hot. What is it and how does it differ from everything else you are read- ing about?   Chapter 9: Big Data and Bigger Data, Little Data, Cloud and Other     Data. All the rage and justifably so, what does the cloud offer? Data    lakes or data swamps? Does size matter or is it performance over volume?  Chapter 10: Statistics, Causation, and Prescriptive Analytics. A few   things you should know about statistics. We discuss one of the most  misunderstood concepts in analytics today!

Yet  every year a “new name” is given to an old procedure either by some feld  new to analytics that does not understand the history of data analysis OR by  a “new company” that wants to “hype” its product by giving an old proce- dure a new name, thus making the unsuspecting audience “think” that a  NEW process has just been discovered, when it has not. In this chapter, we  move into the basics needed for understanding AI, data science and the full  analytics landscape.   The Hip, the Hype, the Fears, the Intrigue, and the Reality   If data is the new oil, why aren’t we all rich? – LinkedIn Post 7 18 19   The Hype   Reality   Good point! Most enterprises are knowledge poor, not data poor.   45    46  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     The Hype   Reality   The Hype   Reality   AI will revolutionize problem solving. In the future, we will not need data  scientists.   AI cannot solve all types of problems even with future advancements  in computing power. There is a class of problems called “Undecidable  Problems” that AI will not solve, regardless of computing power.   The best way to solve a problem is to use the “The New Convolutional  Vortex System” just released by Skynet Corporation! “This Convolutional  Vortex System can do anything, analyze anything, and is 110% accurate” –  so say the advertisements.   We were seeing publicized solutions for techniques and solutions that could    solve virtually all problems. Our mantra has been and will remain throughout    this book that there is no universally best or optimal method  see the    section “There Is No Free Lunch” in the next chapter . That is one of the chief    motivations for writing this book. Furthermore, it is not the technique as much    as it is “are you asking the right questions” that matters. A supreme answer to the    wrong question is not as important as a mediocre answer to the right question.      Introduction   We just covered many reasons why you should be interested in AI, data sci- ence and analytics – why professionals need this book. We explained that  there is a lot of confusion and misinformation available on this material,  primarily hype and marketecture, and there is a need to be objective. There  are objective sources of information, but they are oriented toward narrow  applications or technical material.   We know there is a need to cover the broader subjects including non- technical issues, so in this chapter, we specifcally address building a suc- cessful AI, data science and analytics program  to simplify terminology we  generally refer to all these methods as just “analytics” .    Building a Successful Program  ◾  47           Here we will cover:   ◾  Limitations and gaps in culture and organization    ◾  Justifying an analytics program    ◾  Designing  or redesigning  an analytics program     Culture and Organization – Gaps and Limitations   There are many practicing camps, educational philosophies, and profes- sional organizations that have developed their own languages around the  same topics. Or, they have created a nuanced version of core or founda- tional mathematical constructs to ft their unique problems. While this can  be very benefcial if you belong to a given camp or group, it can limit a  professional in their application of useful techniques. It also keeps practitio- ners isolated and lacking many useful tools and techniques that they could  be using. Learning business cases from one sector, industry or function and  applying that knowledge to another area can be very useful  see “Applying  Engineering to Marketing” in the next gray box .   APPLYING ENGINEERING TO MARKETING   When Scott worked at Texas Instruments, his role was a consulting stat- istician in a large manufacturing plant. One of the groups he supported  was engineering and worked with engineers on “the line.” One method  applied was statistical process control  SPC . SPC had been around for  many  years  and  was  well  known  by  manufacturing  and  engineering  professionals.   A few years later when he went to work for Overstock.com, where he  was supporting Internet retail marketing. A very different feld from high- tech manufacturing! He learned the methods that were used for testing of  marketing campaigns, and also how creative marketing was conducted  for uplift. Overstock was applying A B testing, a common method used  at the time. But, knowing that the problem was essentially the same as  making an “intervention” to a manufacturing line, he was able to save the  company time and money by applying SPC to these problems  see Burk,  2006 . This is an example of borrowing innovative ideas in one feld and  applying them to another feld.   That is why we introduce many felds in this book.    48  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     A key objective for us in this book is to open the veil. We discuss com- monalities of several of the techniques as well as open the door to many  useful techniques across disciplines, at a topical level. In this book, we  speak about the differences in language and process.   Gaps in Analytics Programs   There are issues that exist within organizations that cause problems in mak- ing analytics programs successful. Two of the major areas are people and  processes. Or, put another way, culture, and organization structure. Weakness  in these two areas cause what we will call symptoms. Some of these symp- toms are:   ◾  Lack of Adaptability    ◾  Isolation   Disconnects and Alignment    ◾  Gaps in Education or Knowledge    ◾  Motivation   Incentives     Stories – Examples of these symptoms:   ◾  Our leadership is in the Stone Ages. Everyone has been talking about    being “data driven” for years, yet we operate by the seat of our pants.  Leadership thinks “having been in this industry for thirty years” gives  us an advantage, and maybe in some respects it does. However, there  are many examples where companies with great histories died quickly.  We need to quit talking about being “data driven” as we are barely  scratching the surface and instead dive deep into analytics and AI. What  do we need to do to fnally execute this time? Bottom Line: Lack of  Adaptability, Gaps in Education   ◾  Bless our CEO, but he has been in this business for over 30 years. What    brought us here will not keep us here and he just doesn’t get that. Our  competition is using a new customer targeting system that is intelli- gent, and for the last six months they have been bleeding us out. We  better adopt something quick or we are dead. Bottom Line: Lack of  Adaptability   ◾  Our leadership got sold on AI when several members attended a     national conference. That is great. What is not great is that they had a  vendor come in and sell them a new computer platform without includ- ing the people that will actually use the system in the negotiations.    Building a Successful Program  ◾  49           Now we are stuck into a contract for the next three years with a system  that does half of what we need and the other half is poor. Now our  brightest people are leaving because they want to create solutions and  not consume pre-canned analytics. Bottom Line: Poor Decisions  Made in Isolation by Leadership Team. Lack of Alignment and  Communication   ◾  There are no incentives to work more intelligently. There are no metrics     that tie my performance to that of the company or my annual review.  I don’t know how my job affects the performance of the company or  the numbers that the board is interested in. Bottom Line: Lack of  Organizational Accountability, Poor Motivation   Incentives  ◾  We get paid for doing more. We are not judged by any other mea-    sures. We always say we are acting in the patient’s best interest, but    in reality, if there are two alternatives with approximately similar    outcomes, we often perform the one with the higher reimbursement.    When I say approximate, this is ballpark so we can justify our “deci- sion,” and not necessarily the best decision for an optimal outcome. As    a taxpayer I wish it were different, but that is the way it is. Bottom  Line: Lack of Organizational Accountability, Poor Motivation      Incentives   ◾  Every time we get a new administrator, they have their own design.     They do not learn from their superiors or the people reporting to them.  They just throw out new operational initiatives and we are to execute  them. They either talk a good game above them or move onto the next  event, next company. There is no consistency and it seems we are in a  perpetual reinvent cycle. Bottom Line: Lack of Vision, Lack Clear  Objectives and Consistency   ◾  We created a BI group years ago and it has morphed into Visual BI,     which has had some success. However, it stopped there. We, the practi- tioners, want to move forward, but leadership thinks we are doing fne  with what we have; why fx what isn’t broken? Bottom Line: Lack of  Leadership and Vision, Gaps in Education or Knowledge   ◾  Our CIO has consultants come in and they push some innovative stuff,     it all sounds great and we implement this, but the business does not  get it! Yes, there are steering committees and the whole shebang, but  people take it as something they have to do, something extra. Not  what could actually help them do their job better. Bottom Line: Lack  of Clear Objectives and Consistency, Lack of Alignment and  Communication, Gaps in Education or Knowledge    50  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     ◾  We have tried several “data-driven” initiatives over the decade. Each    time we have limited success. Everyone gets on board and is excited,  but after 6 months or a year we hear the same thing: the results stink  because our data stinks. So we make some efforts to fx it, but those  projects are temporary or short lived. Bottom Line: Bad Data, Gaps  in Education or Knowledge   THESE ARE CULTURAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL   FLAWS – NOT FLAWS IN TECHNOLOGY OR PEOPLE   Example No 1: We tried a pilot predictive modeling project. The team  was involved and we really enjoyed the project. However, the outcomes  were not stellar and another corporate initiative got started. All the mem- bers got pulled into several directions. I wish we had paused to fgure  out  how  we  could  do  it  better.  So  much  for  continuous  learning  and  improvement.   Example No 2: I am part of IT and we brought in a new analytics  system. We had a big kickoff by the CEO and then IT was sent away to  install and confgure the system, which took 6 months. The IT team was  extremely excited about the system. We rolled it out to the business, but  they never really adopted it. At times they used it, but only scratched the  surface of the capability – I would say 10%. The license was expensive  and after two years we dropped it. And, the legacy was that analytics was  the failure, not our organization’s attempted adoption of it.   Example No 3: We started a data science program and hired four    really bright graduates who were eager to start their careers. Everyone    seemed  on  board,  but  in  the  end,  most  of  the  data  science  projects      turned out to be data sourcing  DBA and analyst functions  and data  quality  projects.  Simple  reporting  or  pet   not  data  science   projects.    Within 18 months, we had lost all of our original data scientists. The    feedback  we  got  was  “this  is  not  data  science;  I  want  to  be  a  data    scientist.”      Example No 4: We have a very successful BI program that started  years ago and has evolved into visual, interactive analytics dashboards  with great capability. Out BI team wants to take it to the next level doing  predictive analytics and machine learning. But, leadership thinks we have  all we need. We know a dashboard is not predictive, can only address a    Building a Successful Program  ◾  51           small number of business variables at a time and can sometimes mislead  decision-makers, who might decide to go a direction that is not statisti- cally or practically signifcant. Maybe we have been too successful with  adoption, but we can’t seem to move to the next level.         Example No 5: We have hired some data scientists who are special- ized in AI. My group needs some help as we deal only with small sam- ples and the AI group says that it will not work. They say they need more  data to train models. It seems our brightest bulbs cannot help with our  problem. I went to a conference and I know there are statistical methods  that can help, but these experts only speak ML and AI. I can’t do this on  my own. How disappointing.   This book can help with all these cases.   These stories illustrate diffculties that are rarely technology problems.  They are problems of leadership, culture, alignment, people, and process.  We can trace these issues back to a higher-level categorization.   Characterizing Common Problems   In the preceding section, we appended the example with some key words.  These factors hamper organizations from getting a positive return from their  personnel and fnancial investments. However, they are not the only factors.  Following is a list of causes for shortcomings of analytics success at various  organizations:   ◾  Gaps in Education or Knowledge    ◾  Lack of Adaptability    ◾  Lack of Alignment and Communication    ◾  Lack of Organizational Accountability    ◾  Lack of Vision   Leadership    ◾  Isolation   Disconnects    ◾  Poor Motivation   Incentives    ◾  Organizational Structure    ◾  Lack of Clear Objectives and Consistency    ◾  Organizational Policy    ◾  Improper Planning    ◾  Project Scope      52  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     We now briefy explore a few of these characterizations:   Improper planning manifests itself in lack of project scope contain-  ment  in IT, called “scope creep” , misalignment of people and fnan-   cial assets, unrealistic project schedules, lack of concrete deliverables   what the project is intended to achieve  AND tying those deliver- ables to top metrics – KPI alignment. One additional issue can be    throwing everyone at the problem, i.e., overstaffng, which leads to    people running over each other, not being aligned and not effectively    communicating.   Gaps in education or knowledge lead to many problems in the suc-  cess of enterprise analytics programs. First, lack of leadership education  can lead to wrong decisions in data architecture, analytics architecture,  analytics objectives and goals, and impressive but unreasonable expec- tations. If there is an analytics project failure, it can lead to a false  negative in thinking that analytics doesn’t work, when in fact it was  incorrect design and execution that caused the problems.  See False    Negatives, False Fails and Loonshots gray box below.    FALSE NEGATIVES, FALSE FAILS AND LOONSHOTS: HOW   TO NURTURE THE CRAZY IDEAS THAT WIN WARS,   CURE DISEASES, AND TRANSFORM INDUSTRIES   We  will  cover  a  false  negative  more  deeply  in  the  statistics  chapter   Chapter 10 . Nevertheless, for now, a false negative is arriving at a wrong  conclusion,  thinking  something  did  not  work  when  in  fact  it  did.  Saf  Bahcall calls these “false fails” in his book Loonshots  see Bahcall, 2019 .  Statins  drugs that lower cholesterol levels in the blood , a multibillion  dollar industry, and Facebook, a social media giant that has a market cap  of  over  US$500  billion,  are  two  loonshot  ideas  that  both  experienced  false fails.   When Akira Endo was testing the frst statin, Mevastatin, to see if it  would lower cholesterol, the tests failed. He was testing on rats, which  were  later  discovered  to  have  low  levels  of  LDL  or  “bad  cholesterol.”  When he tested the drug on chickens, which have high levels of LDL,  the results were spectacular. The market for statins exploded, it has been  one of the top-selling drugs of all time and is estimated to prevent half    Building a Successful Program  ◾  53           a million heart attacks and strokes each year. However, it almost did not  happen. Why? Not because the drug did not work, it was simply tested  with a bad experimental design.   FACEBOOK HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE  Saf recalls that in the early 2000s, Facebook was seeking venture capital  while competing with several other social networks. Investors believed  social network sites were a fad since users would abandon established  sites  and  join  new  ones.  Many  were  leaving  a  social  media  site  called  Friendster and moving to other sites such as MySpace. Several investors  passed on Facebook, but one investor dug a bit deeper.   This investor, Peter Thiel, found that users of Friendster were leaving  the site because it was constantly crashing and although the company  had  received  advice  to  fx  and  scale  their  site,  they  ignored  it.  Thiel  concluded that users weren’t leaving the social network because of its  weak business model, but because of a software glitch. Thiel invested in  Facebook and became a billionaire. If he had accepted the “wisdom of  the crowd,” he and Facebook would have lost out.   Analytics  programs  have  proven  themselves  over  and  over.  If  you    have a false start, don’t discount analytics, re-evaluate your implementa- tion of it.   Second, gaps in management- and staff-level knowledge can derail an  analytics program that would be otherwise very successful. It can be asso- ciated with “buy-in,” because people that do not get the right training and  support get frustrated and unmoved, and then the effort falls apart and the  “knowledge from data” effort is seen as not useful.   Adaptability has to do with the willingness of an organization or     individuals within an organization to change. There are numerous    examples of companies that were once extremely successful but are    now dead: – Borders, Sears, Blockbuster, Toys R Us and many more.    They were resistant or unwilling to adapt to a changing marketplace or    technology within a marketplace. Analytics continues to dramatically    change the way organizations operate and is a necessary condition for    survival.    54  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Alignment has to do with making sure that all the pieces of an enter- prise are working together for a common good of the body. Are the  top tiers pulling insight from all levels of the organization or making all  decisions within the c-suite without input from the lower levels of the  organization? Do staff line personnel know how their activity affects the  top-level objectives? Is there a known linkage of the metrics at the top  to metrics generated at the bottom? These are called Key Performance    Indicators  KPIs; they will be discussed in Chapter 5 . Finally, the struc- ture of the organization infuences alignment, and we dedicate a section  on this later in this chapter.   Accountability has to do with the individual ownership of activities and   the results of those activities. While today’s professionals need to be  fuid and often have a lot of leeway in their approach in their activities,  it is important they not only adhere to policy and procedures, but also  support the mission and objectives of leadership. Moreover, the perfor- mance and success of employees should be measured on how well the  employee performed against these objectives. It is important that leader- ship designs clear roles and goals, awards alignment to them and penal- izes behaviors that do not support them.   Isolation   Disconnects are islands  “Silos”  in the organization that act  independently of the rest of the organization. Leaders of these islands  often make decisions which may beneft the local group, but do not  align to the rest of the organization. In analytics parlance, this is called  trying to achieve a local optimum versus a global optimum. This is often  seen in policy decisions, and we will revisit this in Chapter 11, which  speaks on the subject of optimization. This can be due to a functional  organization structure, which we will talk more about in this chapter’s  “Organizational Structure” section.   A great example of silos was freight movement before shipping     containers. The trucking folks loved trucks, the railroad people loved    the rails, the shipping people saw only ships. When one man viewed    it as “I only want to move freight,” he designed the shipping con- tainer and this cross-boundary thinking revolutionized the cargo and    freight industry. See Levinson for a very interesting read  Levinson,    2016 .    Building a Successful Program  ◾  55           Motivation and Incentives impact human behavior. We are all infu-  enced and motivated by incentives. The study of economics is the study  of incentives. Motivation is the fuid which creates new technology,  methods, and growth in society, and is the pathway on which the com- pany must walk, no matter what its “philosophy or camp,” to achieve  success.   FOR FANS OF THE TV SERIES THE OFFICE   Clear  Objectives  and  Consistency.  For  any  readers  that  are  fans  of  The Offce, you may recall an episode where Michael Scott is leaving and  his replacement Deangelo has been hired. Erin, the offce administrative  assistant  is  answering  the  phone,  so  Deangelo  suggests  an  alternative  greeting when answering the company phone. Michael says he prefers  the old way of answering the phone, but the new way is okay, old way  preferred.  Michael  and  Deangelo  are  going  back  and  forth  when  the  phone rings. Erin picks up the phone and is speechless; she hangs on  empty air for a few seconds, then says “I’m sorry” and hangs up. The  camera pans to Michael and Deangelo who are obviously dumbfounded.  This is what you get when management or leadership does not   send clear signals on objectives!   Vision and Leadership. Stephen Covey  see Covey, 1989  does a great   job in defning vision and the differences of leadership and manage- ment. Managing is about effciency. Leadership is about effectiveness.  Effciency focuses on how we can get the most out of the resources we  have. Leadership has to do with where these resources should apply  their effort.   Don’t Confuse Organizational Gaps for Project Gaps   A word of caution on failure, missteps, and gaps. You should not confuse  organizational gaps, which are at a higher, strategic or cultural level, with  project gaps, which are tactical. Here we provide a few reasons projects  fail to live up to expectations. Bear these in mind when assessing that your  project has not lived up to expectations, as you may miss your mark if you    56  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     don’t pay attention to all possibilities. In other words, one needs to attempt  to determine if the issue is systemic in nature, or if the failure is a shortcom- ing in execution. Assuming there is a representative over a project who is  accountable, we will assume that this person is the project manager, and  thus the failure rests with this project manager. Projects can fail when proj- ect managers are not able to do to any of the following:   ◾  Make decisions    ◾  Manage scope    ◾  Manage schedule    ◾  Manage budget    ◾  Manage risks    ◾  Track project progress    ◾  Measure performance    ◾  Communicate effectively    ◾  Resolve problems     Justifying a Data-Driven Organization   For organizations needing to start an analytics or data science program,  we offer several suggestions in this section. These same arguments could  be used as justifcation for revamping or rescaling an existing program. We  start with motivating factors and a few events that might drive organizational  change.   Motivations   Organizations adopt an analytics strategy to help drive business transfor- mation, such as processes and product improvement, market growth and  increased proftability. We look at the two most common motivators for ana- lytics adoption – critical business events and adopting analytics as a winning  strategy. Critical business events are sharp, sudden changes in the market.  Strategic analytics adoption is more proactive and more forward thinking in  nature.   Across organizations of all types, sizes, and industries, the decision to  invest in analytics is often tightly connected to a critical business event. A  critical business event is an incident or phenomenon that disrupts normal    Building a Successful Program  ◾  57           business activity and if left unaddressed the business will ultimately fail.  The reason for this connection is that an analytics focus might uncover the  real issue and thus affect knowledge and subsequent decisions based on  that knowledge that enables the appropriate solution to be enacted. In fact,  proper analytics technology implementation might turn a reactive response  into a proactive innovation opportunity to drive growth for the organization.   Critical Business Events   ◾  Major decline in reimbursement, payment or pricing pressures    ◾  Regulatory compliance changes    ◾  Mergers, acquisition, divestiture or reorganization    ◾  Extreme competitive pressure    ◾  Disruptive technology    ◾  Radically new market approaches    ◾  Critical mass of stagnant culture providing slow and poor     decision-making   ◾  Betting survival on new product    ◾  Betting survival on new services    ◾  Radically new marketing strategies and sales channels    ◾  Signifcant drop in customer retention, loyalty     Analytics as a Winning Strategy   Part I – New Programs and Technologies   Unlike the immediate impact of critical business events that must be  addressed immediately, thinking of analytics as a winning strategy is pro- moted by a forward-looking, long-term mindset. Some strategies focus on  growth, some on cost effciency and some on quicker innovation.   Some common paradigm and innovation drivers include:   ◾  Preparation for new technical capabilities    ◾  Gaining scale to meet market or geographic demands    ◾  Cost savings    ◾  Reduction in organizational structure complexity    ◾  Optimization of internal operations    ◾  Increased business agility      58  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     ◾  Improvements to customer experiences or engagements    ◾  Transformation of products or services    ◾  Disruption of the market from new products or services     Part II – More Traditional Methods of Justifcation   Developing a clear business justifcation for analytics adoption with tangible,  relevant costs and returns can be a complex process. First, review some  common business value areas to help justify the analytics adoption journey.  We consider fve suggestions for an enterprise and defne them below; how- ever, factors in industry may cause you to consider areas more aligned to  your unique situation.   Five suggestions to consider:              1  Positive return on investment  ROI   2  Scale  3  Productivity  4  Reliability  5  Sustainability              Positive Return of Investment   Analytics can show positive ROI on both sides of the ROI equation by  reducing costs and improving revenue. It can drive down the cost to acquire  new patients, customers or constituents. It can drive down the likelihood  of losing those constituents as well. Case studies of operational effciencies  abound that show solid cost reduction, from reduction in waste and obsoles- cence, as well as staff and operational effciency and more. For example, on  the cost reduction side  see Matthews, May 2019; Landi, March 2019 :   ◾  Predictive analytics reduce manufacturing downtime    ◾  Hospitals reduce supply chain costs with analytics    ◾  Predictive analytics cuts down employee turnover    ◾  Analytics cuts customer acquisition costs    ◾  Sales activities are more effciently applied using analytics    ◾  Content marketing costs are reduced using analytics     Similarly, analytics can improve revenue by helping organizations reach  more patients, customers, and constituents. Analytics can enhance    Building a Successful Program  ◾  59           reimbursement, revenue or gross proceeds. Enterprises can attract more  patrons and maximize the contribution per interaction involving products  and services. Depending on the entity, they can optimize reimbursement,  prices or fees.   In the end, you can justify investments in an analytics program when   gross proceeds exceed the total cost of the program – staff resources, tech- nology investment  capital and operating expenses  and any ancillary costs.  This is one of the strongest justifcations for all enterprises. For-proft entities  justify existence by returning value to stakeholders, and as the saying for  nonprofts goes, “no margin, no mission,” meaning that if you cannot sup- port operations you cannot support your purpose.   Scale   Scale is about being able to grow and manage that growth successfully.  One beneft of careful planning of analytics programs and technology is  the ability to scale elastically. That means delivering the appropriate amount  of resources to the program initiatives set by leadership and management.  The ability to add capacity in data, IT and staff resources based on demand,  when and where it is needed, is critical in our present fast-paced environ- ment. It prevents organizations from overexpanding or contracting for near- term objectives and thus makes them able to more proactively adapt to  environmental and market changes.   Productivity is a cornerstone of analytics, especially AI. AI is all about auto- mation – from self-driving cars, to automated warehouses, to cashier-less res- taurants, robotic surgery, and self-service healthcare. Add to this the Internet  of Things  IoT  enabling smart cities and smart homes and infrastructure.  With AI and IoT in place, analytics teams can spend their time on more  important business goals.   Productivity   Reliability   Reliability says “yes” to the question “Is it available when you need it?”  Cellular smart phones are highly reliable these days if you are not in a  remote location. Reliability is about the analytics infrastructure being able  to perform as it was designed and do it now. Reliability is tightly integrated    60  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     with IT systems and processes. It is meant to weather the storms of imme- diate, unforeseen short-term events. Are all incumbent data systems main- tained, backed up and available when needed? Are all the relevant disaster  recovery and failover mechanisms in place? Are people resources available at  the time of need?   Reliability can be threatened and hampered by a misalignment of people   or policy.   Sustainability   Sustainability has to do with the viability of the program for the long haul.  The major threat to reliability  see above paragraph  is based on techni- cal, structural and policy considerations. Sustainability has more to do with  softer, less rigid factors. It is meant to endure the effects of unforeseen future  events. For example, the knowledge and skills your staff possess greatly  affect sustainability. The biggest threat to sustainability is staff turnover. It  used to be the case that you could replace staff rather easily. However, now  more than ever, the value in the heads of personnel is a key determinant of  an organization’s success. It may sound cliché, but now for an analytics pro- gram to succeed, an organization must hire and retain the appropriate staff.  For an example of closing gaps in education, see the Tenure and Education  gray box below.   TENURE AND EDUCATION   Enterprises  that  focus  on  the  short  term  may  have  a  diffcult  time.    They lack long-term sustainability. Knee-jerk realignments and layoffs    limit  keeping  the  knowledge  quotient  in  house.  Unlike  some  roles,    it  often  takes  years  to  become  a  productive  analytics  producer.  As    we  will  see,  it  takes  technical  skills  as  well  as  business  acumen.  At    Shopify, one of the fastest-growing tech companies in the world that    supports e-commerce, they work very diligently on retaining people.    Most  people  think  they  should  be  headquartered  in  Silicon  Valley,    but they resisted this temptation and are located in Ottawa, Canada.    Unlike Silicon Valley, where the same job candidate may be interview- ing with Google, Facebook, Apple and others, Shopify does not have    the same competitive pressure. If someone is willing to interview, pass      Building a Successful Program  ◾  61           their extensive hiring process, get hired and relocate to Ottawa, there      is a level of commitment above just moving to the Valley, where most  new hires will jump ship within 18 months to go across the street. In    addition, Shopify works very hard to keep its employees happy. They      are very long-term and strategically focused, knowing that knowledge  workers need time to be fully productive if the company is to maintain    its success.   Designing the Organization for Program Success   In a previous section  Characterizing Common Problems , we covered some  limitations and gaps that cause the failure of analytics projects and pro- grams. Most of these limitations are driven by culture and organizational  design. The cure is highly dependent on the area of application, the indus- try, and the domain. We feel this is so important to be done right; we are  currently writing a book  see Burk and Miner, 2021  where we cover this  and technical components of architecture. However, we feel it might be use- ful to cover here in this book some high-level components providing a basic  framework for success. This framework should generalize to most enter- prises regardless if they are in healthcare or other areas, and whether they  are a public or private business.   Following are comments and recommendations which we have heard in   the feld:   ◾  Analytics team fell apart.    ◾  Project fell apart.    ◾  Another program! Not another program! I am too busy already! What     will it be next month?   ◾  We were making things happen. Management just killed us  cost cutting     because there were no visible returns .   ◾  Leadership thought it a great idea, but when we wanted to connect with    middle management, they were clueless – upper management had done  no training or communication with middle management.   ◾  Leadership   Management thought they would just hire some nerd-    types, and leave them alone. We are isolated and we need guidance.  We need priority and direction.    62  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     ◾  Management was supposed to help us with the problem defnitions, pri-   ority and deliverables. However, they rarely showed up to our biweekly  meetings. We are frustrated.   ◾  I know my college friend’s company’s analytics program is going gang-    busters. This place will never adopt advanced analytics.   ◾  I am the most likely person to lead this at my company, but I don’t have     ◾  Our sector   industry is broken – healthcare. NO INNOVATION except     a clue how to start!   peer review medical research.   Motivation   Communication and Commitment   Establish Clear Business Outcomes   The most successful analytics adoption journeys start with a business out- come in mind, backed up by fnancial reasoning and support. A business  outcome is a concise, defned and observable result or change in business  performance captured by a specifc measure.   As it is said, success breeds success, and an early win can be a catalyst   for buy-in and commitment from leadership and stakeholders.   VALUE OF THE CFO  CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER       A key player in creating and landing an analytics adoption plan is the  CFO. The CFO can drive the value of innovation and create a fnancial  plan for adoption. The CFO can also work with the Analytics Strategy  Team  to  develop  cost  models  that  compare  the  value  add  of  such  a  program. These models should include key measurements to quantify  business outcomes.         In the following section, Organization Structure and Design, we discuss  organizational structure for the enterprise. To illustrate these concepts, we  assume that an Analytics Oversight Team will be adopted in some form  within the organization. This team will be responsible for the analysis, plan- ning, execution, and oversight of analytics program initiatives. The Analytics  Oversight Team consists of business leaders from all functional areas. It  could be part of a center of excellence  COE  or may report directly to the  c-suite or board.    Building a Successful Program  ◾  63           The Analytics Oversight  or Strategy  Team is responsible for:      ◾  Reviewing business outcomes and creating the business justifcation     plan for possible use cases for the analytics program   ◾  Building or facilitating the project rationalization process, selecting the     frst and subsequent projects and maintaining prioritized backlogs   ◾  Managing communications with key stakeholders and promoting the     analytics adoption journey success and learnings   Here are the key points for this section:   ◾  The key areas to focus on when you develop your data-driven business     strategy are to:    –  Defne your business justifcation by identifying business value     –  Select the right people, processes and technology    –  Establish clear business outcomes to drive transparency and   ◾  Some common business justifcations for adoption include:     opportunities   engagement     –  cost    –  scale    –  productivity    –  reliability    –  sustainability   Organization Structure and Design   The Organization and Its Goals – Alignment   It is critical for organizations to be aligned in their goals, objectives, and  accountability. Most organizations have some sort of mission statement or  statement of purpose. Furthermore, they normally have some sort of stra- tegic plan for the near-term horizon. If done properly this strategic plan  cascades into initiatives with objectives. An organization of any size should  have objectives that are supported by analytics. For example, some of these  might be to maximize growth, maximize revenue, improve patient or cus- tomer loyalty, improve employee retention, reduce the cost of services and   or expand geography or markets.    64  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     ALIGNMENT IS ABOUT GETTING EVERYONE   TO MARCH IN THE SAME DIRECTION.   These  high-level  objectives  start  in  the  c-suite  or  the  boardroom,  but  need to cascade and permeate the entire organization. Moreover, each  functional area should be aware of how its activities impact the larger  goal. More about this in the chapter on BI where we discuss alignment  of KPIs. But, for now, we need:              1  Each person in the organization to know the strategic objectives  2  Each working group in the organization to discuss and know how their       activities affect these objectives  3  All management and leadership to learn how each staff area across the    organization  will  support  the  initiatives  and  how  they  will  measure  their contribution.  4  In general, decisions on staffng, technology, vendor selection, and ser-   vice level agreements  SLAs  to support the entire enterprise. We saw  the lack of this in the previous section on symptoms, Gaps in Analytics  Programs,  where  leadership  made  a  technology  platform  selection  without taking the larger picture into consideration. Obviously, there  may be exceptions, but in general this alleviates problems.   Organizational Structure   There are many options for organizational structure for analytics groups and  staff, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. NOTE: We are specif- cally talking about how the analytics personnel ft within the organization,  not the overall organization. We present three of the most common types:   ◾  Centralized    ◾  Decentralized    ◾  Matrix or hybrid structures     Centralized Analytics   Centralized analytics groups normally exist within a COE or similar group.      The leader of this group may be part of the c-suite, with a Chief Analytics  Offcer reporting to the CEO or president of the organization  see Figure 2.1 .    Building a Successful Program  ◾  65           Figure 2.1  Centralized analytics organization with chief analytics offcer reporting to  CEO.      Alternatively, they could be a vice president or director-level position   reporting to the c-level, COO, CFO or CMO. This is normally determined  by the company culture as some companies are more operationally driven,  others marketing driven. This group has high accountability and may often  be on the board meeting agenda. The advantages of this structure are the  visibility and energy it gets from this high-level reporting. Additionally, all  group members have similar backgrounds: most are data scientists, statisti- cians, or from other data-focused backgrounds. They speak a similar lan- guage and often share similar psychological profles. They want to make a  contribution via data.   The drawbacks of this homogeneous type of group are that they do not  know the business as well as people in the functional areas of fnance, mar- keting, sales, operations, HR  human resources  and customer service. And  they rely on others outside the center of excellence to identify the problems  to work on. AND, analytics projects are a team sport. So, it is criti- cal that members in an analytics COE have access to and support of func- tional personnel. Functional team members are often called subject matter  experts  SMEs, we cover in a later gray box section, Putting it Altogether:  An Example of the Data Science Team in Action , as they know the problem  area very well. In addition, if not carefully planned for, you can run into  issues with the “day jobs” of functional personnel. If you have a fnance  manager with limited personnel and a list of deadlines, they are responsible  for and being judged on meeting these deadlines successfully, they may treat  analytics projects as a secondary priority. This leads to the frustration of the  analytics personnel, as they are highly dependent on these functional areas  for critical education and support.    66  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Decentralized or Embedded Analytics   A decentralized or embedded analytics structure is where the major func- tional areas  accounting, fnance, marketing, sales, operations, customer  service  each have their own analytics specialist members. These members  often have started with experience in the functional area and then as their  careers progress and they take on additional responsibilities they add knowl- edge of analytics, data science, and statistics. They are the “go-to” people  when members of the team need something.   An advantage of this structure is that the analytics staff also have strong  subject matter skills and therefore they are less reliant on going outside to  get the needed information. Furthermore, when they need information they  know exactly who to contact. Finally, the leader of this functional area is  responsible for the success of the project and so this is the “day job” when  the organization is structured this way.   The disadvantage of this framework is that the embedded analytics   professionals often feel isolated and out of touch with other analytics types.  They do not have comrades to bounce ideas off of and may become dis- heartened in their jobs.   Hybrid  report to both an Analytics director AND a functional boss  –   also called a MATRIX organization:         As the name “hybrid” connotes, this is a mixture that has the advantages  of both centralized and decentralized structures. The way this works is that  analytics personnel report into a COE, but there are teams that move across  different vertical functional areas and are project driven. This is a form of a  matrix organization. It is meant to reduce the limitations of each of the pre- vious structures, but allows analytics professionals to be within a common  group for camaraderie and learning while at the same time being part of a  functional team for specifc projects. Another advantage is that an employee  can move across functional areas – say fnance, then human relations  HR ,    etc. This allows for a variety of different projects and learning opportunities.    This can keep the job fresh and interesting. It can provide career progres- sion that helps employee retention; this is especially true for the retention  of disciplinary teams, as these groups of functional specialists are preserved  from one project to the next  UpCouncil, 2019 . For an example of this  structure, see Figure 2.2.      You can see from this fgure that there is a dual responsibility of team   members. Vertically, they report into the analytics leader. Horizontally, they    Building a Successful Program  ◾  67           Figure 2.2  Matrix organization  Data Science Direct with cross-function reporting .      are an asset of a functional area. Here we have examples of functional areas  including marketing, fnance, sales, engineering, and HR. In a similar model,  projects and project managers could replace these functional areas.   Multidisciplinary Roles for Analytics   We now illustrate important roles in the analytics program – remember  that analytics is a team sport. Of course, it is important for any organiza- tion to hire and support the best people. In addition, retaining these people  is of particular importance in deep knowledge areas such as analytics  we  examined this previously in this chapter – see gray box, “Tenure and  Education” .   The size of the organization, the sector, and the mission will dictate roles   for analytics. We briefy outline a few roles that exist to support analytics  projects:   ◾  Data scientists    ◾  Data engineers    ◾  Citizen data scientists      68  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     ◾  Developers    ◾  Business experts    ◾  Business leaders    ◾  Project managers     Data Scientists   We are providing minimal defnitions below, but note these roles can over- lap and differ by organization.   This term has morphed over time. It used to be a catch-all phrase for a uni-   corn, meaning it rarely existed as it covered a broad set of skills and the data    scientist was meant to be a master of all! Now the term is used in a much    more realistic fashion. There are at least three domains that a data scientist    needs to understand, but not necessarily be an expert. The frst is some sort  of mathematical or quantitative background. This could be in applied math-   ematics, statistics, operations research, engineering, econometrics, computer    science or similar. The second is a great use of information technology; often    they are very good at scripting coding, storage, and access technology and    have a good knowledge of digitized data. Finally, they are not theorists, but    practitioners, and they have knowledge of domain of application – some  areas of healthcare, business, social policy or similar.   Data Engineers   This term evolved from the data scientist role. As stated above, its function  was originally considered part of being a data scientist unicorn. The data  engineer knows a lot of what the data scientist does but focuses on the data  piping around analytics projects. They are heavily involved in sourcing his- torical data for analysis and modeling and then making the production data  available to apply models for insight and action.   Citizen Data Scientists   Citizen data scientists are similar to data scientists, but they know a lot more  about the domain they are applying analytics to than the data scientist.  Creation of the “citizen data scientist” role is about the democratization of  data science across the organization. It enables anyone with the aptitude and  mindset to be part of the analytics fabric within the enterprise. Citizen data    Building a Successful Program  ◾  69           scientists normally start their careers in the domain and then add math and  computer skills. Data scientists normally start the other way, beginning with  a strong knowledge of math and computer science and then adding an area  of application to their skillset.   Developers   Developers create interfaces between the back-end data to the front-end  application, thus making analytics available to consumers. Developers may  work closely with data scientists and data engineers to create these inter- faces, or they may use tools independently and work with business users or  citizen data scientists.   Business Experts   Business experts provide the context and very important domain knowl- edge around analytics projects. At times, they are historians, knowing how  changes in the business result in changes in the data. We will see more  about this in the next chapter, under Processes Drive Data. Moreover,    without process knowledge, data is meaningless; therefore, data science or  AI without business expertise will fail.   Business Leaders   Business leaders provide resources  budget and people , energy and motiva- tion. They provide smooth access to IT and other resources external to the  team. They are accountable for project results and therefore they will drive  to make sure the team is on track and schedule.   Project Managers   Project managers are vital to organizations with a matrix structure and are a  good idea in any analytics program. They are responsible for project goals  and objectives, metrics, deliverables, and documentation. They schedule  meetings that include project kick-offs with leadership, working team meet- ings on a regular cadence that review tasks completed and scheduled, and  project results and next steps again with leadership. They are responsible for  all documentation, metrics, successes and end-of-project reviews of analytics  projects.    70  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     The size of the organization will dictate whether all these roles are   required or whether certain people will have to fulfll the tasks of multiple  roles.   MOST MAJOR CHALLENGES IN ANALYTICS   ARE PEOPLE AND PROCESS   Kaggle  is  recognized  as  an  online  community  of  data  scientists  and  machine learners. They promote many analytics competitions and host  surveys of analytics professionals. These surveys have some of the high- est response rates and are well done, providing valuable information.   In August 2017, they conducted “The State of Data Science & Machine  Learning” survey with over 16,000 responses. There were several ques- tions, but one very meaningful question for us was “What barriers are  faced at work?” Out of the top 15 responses, almost all were people and  process issues. There was only one in the top 15 that was clearly about  technologies or platform, 12, limitation of tools. Most of the others we  have categorized in this chapter. As an exercise, see if you can map the  following list to our characteristics. These are in order, 1 being the most  frequent.                                  1. Dirty data  2. Lack of data science talent  3. Lack of management   fnancial support  4. Lack of clear question to answer  5. Data unavailable or diffcult to access  6. Results not used by decision-makers  7. Explaining data science to others  8. Privacy issues  9. Lack of domain expert input  10. Can’t afford data science team  11. Multiple ad hoc environments  12. Limitation of tools  13. Need to coordinate with IT  14. Expectations of project impact  15. Integrating fndings into decisions                                     See www.kaggle.com surveys 2017.    Building a Successful Program  ◾  71           Analytics Oversight Committee  AOC  and  Governance Committee  Board Report    We will not go into depth in this book on this topic, but make a few  remarks for consideration. It should be obvious that visibility to leadership  is highly correlated with results. It is therefore very important to form some  oversight or steering committee with accountability to the CEO and board of  directors. There should be monthly or quarterly reporting of activities with  metrics of success, postmortems of projects and future plans. The commit- tee will determine whether projects are continued or eliminated. This com- mittee will have a say in the list of projects for the analytics team and help  prioritize them. Visibility and accountability of the AOC can leverage future  budgets.   It is not uncommon for analytics committees to be sister groups to IT   committees, as they can share the same data governance and security  policies.   Ethics in AI and data science is a very hot topic with Cambridge   Analytica, Facebook and others under severe scrutiny in 2018 and continu- ing throughout 2019  Gourley, March, 2018 . The EU has adopted special  laws to help in the ethical use of data including the General Protection  Data Regulation  GDPR  implemented in May 2018  De Groot, July 15, 2019 .  Ethics can roll up into an oversight committee or an ethics department.   For more information on building a successful analytics program from  organizational structure to data and analytics architectures, see Burk and  Miner  2021 .   Postscript   We have just covered the justifcation for an analytics program. Moreover, we  covered limitations and gaps in many programs and how you can overcome  these gaps by correctly designing your program for success. Next, we looked  at similarities across the different analytics domains before we dove deeper  into each. In our next chapter, we lay the foundations. We take a topical  look at what unites these techniques and technologies. We will start to learn  a common language and at the same time we will discover there are many  dialects – some of the basics of terminology of AI and data science, and also  consider algorithms, mental concepts, models, paradigms, decisions and the  need for additional tools that are “in vogue” today. We will show you that    72  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     there is a need well beyond what is commonly presented – an analytics  culture, an organization designed for success and many things that are often  not considered but are paramount.

Chapter 3  Some Fundamentals –    Process, Data, and Models   Keywords: Data-Driven, Process, Models, Algorithms, CRISP-DM, No Free  Lunch Theorem, Signal and Noise   Preamble   In Chapter 2, we considered shortcomings of existing analytics programs –  limitations and gaps in culture and organizations. We discussed building a  successful analytics program by justifying and selling the concept through- out the organization, then avoiding gaps by redesigning or designing the  program for success. In this chapter, we move into the basics that are shared  across different data-driven techniques before we launch into upcoming  chapters, where we cover each topic independently and more in-depth.   The Hip, the Hype, the Fears, the Intrigue, and the Reality   The Hype   “We don’t consider customers cargo,” said Jaguar’s head of R&D, Wolfgang  Epple, in 2015. “We don’t want to build a robot that delivers the cargo from  A to B.”      75    76  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Reality   Introduction    According to Thompson Reuters  Jaguar Land Rover has since invested  US$25 million in Lyft to cash in on the autonomous trend.   What motivated us to write the book? We have visited with people  across many industries and organizations and discovered recurring themes.  In the last chapter, we covered a recurring theme – what keeps analytics  programs from being as successful as they could be? A different environment,    culture, and structure make all the difference in the world toward success or  failure, and we provided some guidelines.   This book covers a very broad range of topics, from business intelligence     BI  to artifcial intelligence  AI . Some topics are more complex, some more    intuitive, some have long histories, some are more novel. So, an obvious ques- tion is, what do they have in common? Why all these topics? The singular    underlying element in the book is using data to solve real-world prob- lems. Other recurring themes are data, signal vs noise, models, and algorithms.   This chapter will cover the commonalities of practice and application  amongst the various methods covered in the book. What do data science  and mathematical programming have in common? What do statistics and AI  have in common? Is there a common process methodology that an orga- nization can use whether the problem they are working on is a decision  science problem or a statistical design? Is there a common framework?    Let us call these various groups of practitioners as “camps.” These different  camps speak different languages, yet their conversations are often about the  same thing. We will not translate everything, but we will try to synthesize  some common practices in this chapter.      One of the most important themes of this book is the need for lots of  tools in the toolbox. Why do we emphasize a list of tools when there are  some very powerful ones that solve a lot of problems, take for example AI.  Because there is no universally optimal methodology or analytics  paradigm that works best on all problems. We will explore this in this  chapter: There is No Free Lunch.         Framework for Analytics – Some Fundamentals   We now explore some fundamentals that are often overlooked when apply- ing or consuming analytics. These are fundamental and important because    Some Fundamentals – Process, Data, and Models  ◾  77           many people assume them away, and when there are issues or shortcom- ings, they look for in the wrong direction to solve the problems. A few fun- damentals here:   ◾  Processes and systems are everywhere    ◾  Data are generated by a process    ◾  We collect some of this data    ◾  We analyze data and create models    ◾  Analytics and models provide insight    ◾  Insights inform action    ◾  Action improves life     Processes Are Everywhere   We often do not think in these terms, but you participate in and observe  thousands of processes and systems in a day. You get out of bed and take a  shower: that shower is a process. You dress and ready yourself for the day,  which is a process. You fx breakfast, which is a process. Getting to work by  walking, car, bus or train is a process or a multistep process.   A system is a set of interrelated processes. The bus to work contains a  large number of systems – an electrical system, an engine, a powertrain,    GPS and many more. These systems are composed of thousands of pro- cesses. Each and every one of these processes generates an observable  result. Each observable result can be recorded. Recorded results are data.         Processes Drive Data     We will soon explore models and algorithms. For algorithms to generate    models, we must feed them data. We collect data at a dizzying rate these    days, as we explained in Chapter 1 and we will talk deeply about all sorts    of data in Chapter 8. We collect data in a variety of ways – manual entry    into smart phones, computers, and notepads. Computers collect most of    the data without us even knowing – cameras, sensors, voice, electronic    sensors, machines, devices, telemetry. At the heart of this collection are    again systems and processes. We do not think about it most of the time,    but when we do, we realize life consists of processes. Therefore, we have    a great opportunity to improve life by understanding these processes via  analytics.       78  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     The following are some examples of processes and systems and the data   they generate.   Examples of Processes and Systems   Data Generated   Human   biological systems   EKGs, ECGs, smart watch data   Smart phone video recording   Video  MOV, MP4 data    Book writing   Handwritten pages or word-processing fles   Delivery, postal, transportation   Telematics, GPS and logistics data   Smart cities   Doctor’s visit   Data from sensors, cameras  CCTV , traffc  impedance detectors   Data in an electronic medical or health  record  EMR EHR  system or computerized  physician order entry  CPOE    Exercising, gym routines, workouts   Log book, smart phone app   NFL games   Medical bill payment   Video, sports statistics, play movement   Billing codes, patient info, claim adjudication,  payment splits, payment processing   Customer survey process   Customer ratings, comments   Moreover, note that there are millions of things that could be collected as  data but only some are collected, although the number of processes col- lected as data is increasing. In fact, think about video. The streets of most  cities a few years ago were just as full with the bustle of activity as they are  today. However, today, that bustle is captured on video, being recorded,  generating data that can be analyzed.   As said by a famous statistician  W. Edwards Deming  a long time ago: “In     God we trust, all others bring data.” We can do that more than ever today.    Data has the ability if used correctly to separate anecdotes and hyperbole    from facts. In this book, we explore how we can use data intelligently to    build analytical models. First, we need to explore “what is a model?”   SIGNAL AND NOISE – ANOTHER CONSISTENT THEME   Data  that  we  collect  hopefully  contains  some  signal,  i.e.,  what  we  are  interested in quantifying or qualifying. However, all collected data will  contain noise as well. Using the techniques described in this book, we    Some Fundamentals – Process, Data, and Models  ◾  79           want to be able to flter out the noise and beneft from modeling the sig- nal relationships. The best example to explore this is the concept of pick- ing up a radio signal. We hope most people reading have experienced  trying to dial in a radio station. When you are between stations, you are  hearing what is referred to as “white noise” and you use the tuner to dial  in the radio station you want to hear as best you can.   Another  noise  example  is  when  you  are  talking  with  a  person  on  a cell phone in a public environment like an airport. There is a lot of  “background noise” and the task for the listener is trying to distinguish  the signal – what is being said, what is of interest, versus the background  noise, the voices and the din around the person in the airport.         For  a  data-driven  example,  assume  you  are  trying  to  determine    what  is  important  to  restaurant  customers.  One  way  to  try  to  fg- ure this out is by using surveys. There is a lot of noise in restaurant      surveys.  Some  people  take  time  to  thoughtfully  respond  and  some    people just check boxes randomly. These random responders create  a lot of noise. All data involves a measurement process and the level    of signal and noise is greatly infuenced by the measurement process.    Measurements made by an electron microscope are much more accu- rate than when one of the authors measures the length of a wall with    a tape measure.   Various mixtures exist of the amount of signal versus the amount of  noise. Surveys are very noisy – people’s opinions change daily… mood  affects, etc. How much signal can you measure vs noise? Podcast – back- ground noise – can one use a flter to decrease background noise? Some  podcast hosts use flters after the program has been recorded to take out  the background noise. Obviously, fltering is popular in Hollywood pro- ductions both for audio and video cleanup.   Finally, an alternative to signal to noise is looking at it the other way  around, which is how much information is contained in data. A pod- cast, movie, radio – all of it is data. Information, signal, and noise will be  very important concepts as we move forward. We will see that if we have  a lot of information we do not necessarily need a ton of data.   It is important to know when more data is useful or not useful. We will  cover this more in depth in our chapter on data  Chapter 9 . For rare or  infrequent events, it is useful to collect data over longer time periods and  this leads to bigger data sets. However, contrary to popular opinion, “Big  Data” is not the solution for many analytics problems.    80  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Models, Methods, and Algorithms   Models, Models, Models   We will be talking a great deal about models in this book: AI models,  machine learning models, statistical models and more. We will be using this  in a very general sense, but what is a model? We deal with models uncon- sciously, all the time. Without them, we would have a hard time navigating  through life. A model is just a representation of a mental concept. We pro- vide three diverse examples. First, take a look at the following  Figure 3.1 :  Yes, the number seven is a model. All numbers are models. Humans  constructed the ideas of counting long, long ago. We have since created vol- umes about mathematics and sometimes numbers are useful in mathemati- cal theory. Seven is also a whole number, it is an integer, it is discrete, it is  halfway between six and eight, it is odd, it is prime and it pays in Vegas! All  of these concepts circle around a mental model of the number seven.   When I  Scott  tell people that they have never seen a number, they have   a hard time with it. “What? No, this is a number and it is seven, it is real  and it exists.” The fact is you have never seen a number! It is a concept, a  model, a manmade one. You have only seen a representation of a number.  While there are books on pi and epsilon and cool relationships of numbers  to nature, they are still mental models, concepts. To put it another way, a  number is something that man created to describe the world he lives in. A  model is a representation of reality, not reality itself. It may be a very  good representation of reality or a very poor representation. A quote by a  famous statistician, but it applies to all models – “All models are wrong, some  models are useful” – George E. P. Box  see the following gray box about  how airplanes are based on old information .   Figure 3.1  A simple model.       Some Fundamentals – Process, Data, and Models  ◾  81           NEWS ALERT! AIRPLANES BASED ON   300-YEAR-OLD MODELS!   Have you fown lately? Did you know airplanes are designed on old mod- els that we know are wrong?   Airplanes, cars, almost every engineering feat that you use every day  is based on an antiquated model called Newtonian physics, which most  high school and undergraduate courses revolved around. But we know  that Newtonian models are wrong. They are too simple when you get  into the teeny tiny nitty-gritty of matter and its relationships. Einsteinian  physics, quantum mechanics, etc. are much closer to the truth of the way  things really work. And, it turns out that even these models have faws.  Yet, we fy billions of miles a year, drive billions of miles a year and    use kitchen and home gadgets very successfully. Engineers are not using    the latest and greatest physics models to build everyday things because it    does not matter. They use what works well for the problems they solve    and the theory that is over 300 years old. YES, 300 years old, not the latest    and greatest, not the sexiest quantum mechanics. That is consistent with    our theme: know there are many tools and use the right one for the job.   Statistical Models   A simple statistical model might be estimating tomorrow’s high temperature  based on today’s high temperature. Without any other information we would  probably estimate tomorrow’s temperature to be the same as today’s. This  is a simple estimation model, called a naïve model in time series. And, you  would not expect this model to be particularly accurate. Note there are only  three outcomes:   ◾  our estimate is low    ◾  our estimate is high    ◾  our estimate is correct     But we would usually be wrong with such a simple estimate.   From there we can add many improvements to our model. For instance,    we can use several years of historical data to make the forecast more accu- rate, thus creating a time series model. Alternatively, we could use other      82  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     factors like airfow, pressure differences, etc. to predict tomorrow’s tem-   perature via an algorithmic or machine learning method. An algorithm  is simply a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other    problem-solving operations. It is a recipe of sorts with instructions to fol- low. Following the set of instructions for this problem results in a formula     sometimes it may result in a long set of computer codes depending on the    problem you are trying to solve . This formula is our solution, the repre- sentation of our model for this problem. This type of model is a predictive    model, because based on new inputs it predicts an outcome. Predictive    models are a major topic of this book and we create them in lots of ways in    upcoming chapters. In addition, it should be noted that using this model we      would often be wrong, but hopefully we would outperform simple guessing  or the naïve method. How do we improve results? By knowing many meth- ods and knowing where and when to apply them – we help you do this in    this book!   Rules of Thumb, Heuristic Models   Another model or concept that is very useful is a non-algorithmic model that  is based upon studying the world around us, an observational model. This is  sometimes called a rule-of-thumb model, or heuristic model. Vilfredo Pareto,  an Italian economist, developed the Pareto Principle in 1896. He showed  that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population. This sim- ple rule has proven itself many times over in everything from economics, to  healthcare, to natural science, to social networking. It therefore is sometimes  referred to as “the law of the vital few,” the “80 20 rule” or the “principle of  factor sparsity.”   To summarize, models are everywhere. They are mental concepts that   we use to navigate our world. They can be generated by simple observation,  by mathematical derivation and via algorithms. The models we will empha- size in this book will include all three. BI and visual analytics emphasize  observation and human cognition. Predictive and advanced analytics,  machine learning and AI depend primarily on algorithmic generation of    models. Statistical, linear and mathematical programming models are nor- mally derived by mathematical derivation. Simulation is a bit broader in  that we create an algorithm to simulate a model that could be derived math- ematically or simply based on a heuristic. We cover all of these and more in  this book.    Some Fundamentals – Process, Data, and Models  ◾  83           A Note on Cognition   Scott has a particular interest in where cognition happens. Essentially, in  description, prediction or analysis of any type these days, cognition occurs  in two places – a machine or machines and your head. The real beneft of  cognition is two-fold: increased knowledge and improved decision-making.  Today, we have access to more information via our smart phone than all  the information than the Library of Congress has on its shelves. Note that  the information via that phone is not curated and may be garbage, whereas  presumably most of the information in the Library of Congress is valid or  at least vetted. Nevertheless, information via a machine is readily accessible  and may be useful.   If we use that information to make a decision, we still do the fnal com-  putation for the decision in our head. There may be a layer of analytics  involved in the smart phone information as well. It could be that we are  trying to decide where to eat and we use the wisdom of the crowd, in other  words, some sort of restaurant rating app. That app gives us a map with  pins of the locations of the restaurants and distance to our location, a snap- shot of cuisine offered, the customer ratings, hours and more. We mentally  process that information to make a decision. So this decision is aug- mented by analytics. We will see several examples where knowledge and  decisions are shared by machines and humans.   However, there is another set of problems that are decided and acted   upon solely by machines. Self-driving cars are an example: the sensors  of the car stream data into data stores, this data is run against computer  code  generated by a predictive model  and a prediction is passed to a sec- ond layer of code, where a decision is generated  by a prescriptive model  – the optimal action based on the current data  and subsequently passed to  the control system of the car to accelerate, brake or turn. This is done con- tinuously and in microseconds.     We will discuss the full landscape where most or all of the decisions     and actions are done by a machine as in the self-driving car example.    And, we will discuss methods where most of the cognition is performed  in the brain as in the restaurant selection problem. But it is very impor-   tant to understand the shortcomings of each option. There are things    that humans do very well, there are things that machines do very    well and there are things done best by the marriage of mind and  machine. Be careful in the selection of your technique for your problem    at hand.    84  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Algorithms, Algorithms, Algorithms   We mentioned algorithms briefy, but let’s dive in a little more in this section.  For simplicity, we talked about algorithms as recipes. More formally, an algo- rithm is a sequence of instructions typically to solve a class of problems or  perform a computation. In analytics, we analyze data and build models with  algorithms. We will see that we can build predictive models to, well, predict  things. Consider building a predictive model to determine the length of stay  in a hospital, not “in general” but with specifcity for “each individual.” We  may use many different historical factors  age, gender, disease, comorbidity,  and many others  to build our model. We will cover this specifc process in  detail in a later chapter  Chapter 6 , but for now, suppose we have a model.  Once we have a model, we can represent that model in computer code.  We now have a model that is, yes, represented by an algorithm. This algo- rithm is now used for a different purpose. This scoring algorithm is used to  create a score, an estimate of our length of stay for a new patient given their  unique characteristics. This confuses many people! The terms “model” and  “algorithm” are often used interchangeably, but most of the time this does  not cause major problems.   To simplify things, some people just call that executable code that scores   new patients, a model. The following is a simple diagram that attempts to  capture this  see Figure 3.2 . The actual process will be covered in various  chapters throughtout the book, depending on the application.   This is another example that, if you understand it, will put you well   ahead of most people that are practicing predictive analytics today. At some  point, when you feel comfortable, you might do a search and see some blog  posts on the confusion. It is very enlightening and illustrates another rea- son you need this book!   Figure 3.2  Algorithm use and model creation.       Some Fundamentals – Process, Data, and Models  ◾  85           Distinction between Methods That Generate Models   We will explore several methods of analysis and model building in this  book. We now make some brief comments on some advantages and disad- vantages of these methods. We will provide in-depth coverage of each in  subsequent chapters.   The frst example is when we derive a solution from a small set of for-  mulas or rules that are evaluated in a fnite number of operations. These are  called closed-form expressions. A very simple closed-form expression is the  average of a sample. Step 1: sum up all the elements in the sample. Step 2:  take that sum and divide by the number of elements in the sample. The  result is the statistical mean or average of the sample. Some solutions require  many more steps, but it is always a fnite number of steps. At the heart of  these closed-form expressions are assumptions and solving with calculus to  derive the closed-form expression. So thanks, math people, for providing a  much simpler set of equations or better yet a computer program implemen- tation of these formulas that solves it for us.   The major advantages of closed-form solutions are they are less computer   intensive, meaning they will run quickly. In addition, they are often trans- parent, meaning you can understand what the model they generate actually  does when you apply them. The main disadvantage of these solutions is that  they most often come with assumptions. Some statistical and mathematical  algorithms are closed-form solutions. When the assumptions made are ten- able, these are often the best method to choose.   The second set is algorithms that require a computer program to search   for the best answer. Machine learning and other data mining methods are  domains for these algorithms. This is typically done by specifying a candi- date solution  model or solution space  and letting the computer run until it  fnds the best possible solution based on some criteria. An example could  be imaging processing, where we use a model-building algorithm to gener- ate a model to predict a brain aneurysm based on patient brain scans.   However, using these algorithms, the best answer might never be found.   Why? Read on…     The main advantage of these algorithms is that fewer assumptions have   to be made. They are very forgiving, whereas the closed-form solutions  sometimes are not. And, machine learning algorithms often generate very  good models. However, depending on what algorithm you select, they may  not be transparent in how they actually do what they are doing – remember  the 2008 fnancial crisis? Another drawback is that if these algorithms are    86  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     not carefully used they could generate a local optimum, meaning that a bet- ter solution exists, but the algorithm did not fnd it. Finally, they may require  a lot of computing time, but this is less of a constraint with modern technol- ogy and this is the reason behind their popularity.   Finally, some models are developed without any formal formula or algo- rithm. They are developed by experience and observation. These are heu- ristic models, or they may be called a “rule of thumb” model. An example  is a deterministic rule based on someone’s experience or expert opinion as  we saw previously with the Pareto Principle. If I am working on a manufac- turing line, I can posit that 80% of the defects will be caused by 20% of the  process.   Another heuristic model is a rule-based model. We might formulate these  rules into a computer script than can be executed on demand. For example,  if someone comes into my website on a specifc landing page from this zip  code and also came through yesterday, then present them with this offer  based on a set of rules encoded into my website. The advantages of heuris- tic models are they are transparent, simple and easy to create. They can also  be enhanced and made more powerful via computer simulation.   There Is No Free Lunch   We just covered three classes of models, but we also have available AI mod- els, machine learning models, linear programming models and many more.  Which one is best? Everyone likes shortcuts. Shortcuts help in life by saving  mental energy, time and resources. While we hope this book is useful in  determining the correct method to do your analysis, we know from experi- ence that there is no free lunch. Actually, this thought is an extension of a  formal theorem. The no free lunch theorem. There is no panacea for  analytics.      Certain analytic solutions are often presented as the Killer Tech Bullet.   For example, AI is all you need! It solves everything and soon we will all  not have a care in the world. We will not have to work because robots and  automation will do everything for us. We will not have to drive. We will not  have to think because AI will do all our thinking for us. Unfortunately, AI    is not a silver bullet either at a grand scale. In fact, it is not a silver bullet  on a minor scale.    Some Fundamentals – Process, Data, and Models  ◾  87           We present many technological developments across decades:   ◾  In many circumstances, the older ones outperform the new ones  AI is     actually an old idea .   ◾  At times, the simpler methods outperform the more complicated ones.    ◾  In some domains – healthcare, science and ethical business practice you     would like transparency of these models. You want to know how they  work. You do not want a black box  see “What Is a Black Box Solution  – Skynet and Wall Street” in the next gray box .   WHAT IS A BLACK BOX SOLUTION –   SKYNET AND WALL STREET   In science, computing, and engineering, a black box is a system which  can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs, without any knowledge  of its internal workings. In other words, it is NOT transparent in how it  works.   Skynet was a highly advanced computer system possessing artifcial  general intelligence in the movie Terminator. Because Skynet had self- generated  its  intelligence,  no  one  knew  what  the  computers  and  code  inside Skynet really did or what intelligence it included. The code and  system were a black box. Once it became self-aware, it saw humanity  as a threat to its existence and it decided to trigger a nuclear holocaust  on Judgment Day. Later, it would develop and deploy an army of termi- nators against humanity, whose survivors had formed a resistance group.  Bottom line: black boxes and the end of humanity – not good.           2008  FINANCIAL COLLAPSE  Wall  Street  professionals  and  high-frequency  traders  have  been  using    machine learning models for years for trading and optimizing portfolios.      Many  attribute  the  2008  meltdown  to  fnancial  institutions  not  really    understanding  the  models  they  were  running   Lewis,  2010;  Baldwin,  2019;  Northwestern Business Review, 2016 . This led to overconfdence,    which led to a cycle of overlending, leverage and risk that tanked the    economy.         88  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     BLACK BOX APPEARING AS A WHITE BOX  What can be more transparent than the written word, text? Or, search  results  from  a  search  bar  entry?  Yet,  Cambridge  Analytica,  Facebook,  Google, and Twitter, among others, all have come under fre for having  algorithms that presented biased results to users. Cambridge Analytica is  now defunct due to exposure by many sources of its business practices.  Other tech companies have had to appear before Congress and special  committees.   At the end of the day, no method, paradigm or algorithm is   UNIVERSALLY optimal! This is an extension of the No Free Lunch  Theorem developed by David Wolpert. In 2005, Wolpert and Macready  themselves indicated that the frst theorem in their paper “state[s] that any  two optimization algorithms are equivalent when their performance is aver- aged across all possible problems”  see Wolpert and Macready, 2005 . In  brief, there are many things to consider. The bottom line is not to let some- one sell you a solution that will only apply to a small subset of your prob- lems. Just be cautious about separating the hype from reality.   An interesting machine learning example of this is referenced in the  “Resources for the Avid Learner” section at the end of the chapter  see  Banko and Brill, 2001 , where they compare four machine learning algo- rithms to determine which meaning of a word is activated by the use of the  word in a particular context  disambiguation . Let us defne the “best” algo- rithm as the one having the highest test accuracy. They start with a training  set of a half-million words and a simple memory-based learner performs  the best, ranks 1. Interestingly, as the number of words used in training  increases up to a billion words, the rank positioning of the four methods  inverts. The algorithm that originally ranked worst, 4  a winnow algorithm ,  now performs the best, and the original winner  simple memory-based  learner  performs the worst of the four, rank 4. As with most situations, the  best, and we have to be careful what we mean by “best,” is dependent on  the data!   Note something important here, in defning what you mean by best. One     of the most important takeaways of this book is to think and ask  what “best” means! What is the best mutual fund? What is the best work- out? What is the best diet? Read the headlines: you will defnitely see these  in the title! But, best workout for what? Best workout for a body builder?    Some Fundamentals – Process, Data, and Models  ◾  89           Best workout for endurance training? Best workout to improve fexibility and  reduce joint pain? One important takeaway here – do not let someone  else fnd what is best or optimal for you – defne it based on your  needs and the nuances you face.   In the example above, we defned “best” as having the highest training     accuracy. We could have defned “best” as the fastest to train, cheapest,    the one with the most vowels in the name, anything, any criteria. DEFINE    “BEST.” When someone is trying to sell you something by telling you it is      the best, ask for comparisons with “worse” products and ask “why.” When  someone says XYZ is best – make them defne what “best” means. We    will be talking about this in detail in Chapter 11 on optimization, where    we have to defne carefully our criteria of what “best” means in a rigorous    sense. In the meantime, whenever you read something, engage with some- one or hear something and the term “best” is used, think critically about    what it means!   A Process Methodology for Analytics   Professionals in healthcare know that protocols and standards are very  important to improve effciency, decrease costs and improve outcomes.  Standards should serve as guidelines that are fexible, but offer a framework  in which to work. The CRISP-DM  Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data  Mining  was developed to provide a framework for the data mining process.  While it was developed for data mining or machine learning, it is applicable  to many analytics, statistical and other data-related projects.   It was developed in 1996 by analysts representing Daimler Chrysler, SPSS  and NCR. CRISP-DM provides a nonproprietary and freely available standard  process for feeding data mining into the general problem-solving strategy of  a business or research unit. There are many references for this process; an  example is seen in Larose  see Larose, 2005 .   According to the standard, most data mining  data-related projects    have a lifecycle that can be broken into six phases of interrelated activities.  This process is illustrated in Figure 3.3. It should be noted that the phase  sequence is adaptive, meaning that the next phase of the sequence is often  dependent on the results from a previous phase. It is iterative, meaning that  each phase may need to be revisited based upon the knowledge discovery  or results in a later phase. For example, in the modeling phase, it may be  determined that certain variables need to be transformed  modifed  and    90  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Figure 3.3  The CRISP-DM process fow.      therefore the process would revert back to the previous data preparation  phase.   This process template affords continuous learning, meaning lessons   learned in previous projects may be incorporated into new ones. Reiterating  that the six phases of the process cycle may be directly sequential, we will  provide a quick guide of the six phases of CRISP-DM.   CRISP-DM: The Six Phases:   ◾  Business understanding phase  this frst phase in the CRISP-DM     standard process may also be termed the research understanding phase     –  Enunciate the project objectives and requirements clearly in terms of   the business or research unit as a whole.     –  Translate these goals and restrictions into the formulation of a data   mining problem defnition.     –  Prepare a preliminary strategy for achieving these objectives.   ◾  Data understanding phase       –  Collect the data.    –  Use exploratory data analysis to familiarize yourself with the data   and discover initial insights.     –  Evaluate the quality of the data.    Some Fundamentals – Process, Data, and Models  ◾  91             –  If desired, select interesting subsets that may contain actionable   patterns.   ◾  Data preparation phase       –  Prepare from the initial raw data the fnal data set that is to be used   for all subsequent phases. This phase is very labor intensive.     –  Select the cases and variables you want to analyze and that are   appropriate for your analysis.     –  Perform transformations on certain variables, if needed.    –  Clean the raw data so that it is ready for the modeling tools.   ◾  Modeling phase       –  Select and apply appropriate modeling techniques.    –  Calibrate model settings to optimize results.    –  Remember that often, several different techniques may be used for   the same data mining problem.     –  If necessary, loop back to the data preparation phase to bring the   form of the data into line with the specifc requirements of a particu- lar data mining technique.   ◾  Evaluation phase         –  Evaluate one or more of the models delivered in the modeling phase   for quality and effectiveness before deploying them for use in the feld.     –  Determine whether the model in fact achieves the objectives set for   it in the frst phase.     –  Establish whether some important facet of the business or research   problem has not been accounted for suffciently.     –  Come to a decision regarding the use of the data mining results.   ◾  Deployment phase     completion of a project.     –  Make use of the models created: Model creation does not signify the     –  Example of a simple deployment: Generate a report.    –  Example of a more complex deployment: Implement a parallel data   mining process in another department using a completely new  dataset.   It should be noted that there are some other frameworks available that have  been created by commercial software vendors. However, CRISP-DM is used  more than other methods according to KDnuggets  see Piatetsky, 2014 ,  where it ranked highest in the “main methodology you are using for your  analytics, data mining, or data science projects,” followed by “my own,”  commercial and other methodologies falling way behind.    92  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     CRISP-DM is a simple, high-level process but it will not necessarily   incorporate all the components of a process methodology. Depending on  the questions or objectives being considered, the data, the timeline, and  many other considerations, you may need a much more involved process.    For example, in AI projects you should consider data validation, means of    version control and model governance, model health and process stability,  production control, application integration and more. We will cover some  of these in more depth in the applicable chapters, but CRISP-DM is a good  basis for organizations considering repeatable methodologies.   The CRISP-DM methods are meant as a framework and have been   proven to be useful in many projects. And, it can help from reinventing  project milestones and deliverables each time one is working on a new  project. In the end, the project team should determine if it is useful for the  particular project at hand.   Last Considerations   We have a lot to say about data and analytics architecture. We decided that  we wanted to expand on this section greatly along with many components  in Chapter 2, so we decided to write another book dedicated to this subject   see Burk and Miner, 2021 . We simply point out a few considerations here.   Data Architecture   Data architecture is a framework of rules, policies, procedures, standards,  and systems that govern data in the organization. Today, data and people  are the two most valuable and strategic assets in the enterprise. Data  architecture links collected data to the business rules that translate it  into meaningful contexts. Data architecture specifes what data is acces- sible, whether it is stored and how it is used. It provides data governance  which covers access, security, change management, scale, reliability and  sustainability  mentioned in Chapter 2 .         Analytics Architecture   Analytics architecture refers to the applications, infrastructures, tools and  leading practices that enable access to and analysis of information to opti- mize business decisions and performance. It supports all current analytics    Some Fundamentals – Process, Data, and Models  ◾  93           needs and strategically plans for future needs and initiatives. Many organiza- tions start with descriptive and diagnostic analytics. These are often accom- plished with interactive BI platforms, dashboards and Visual BI platforms  and statistical programs. It may include analytics that are embedded into  functionally specifc platforms for medical radiology, business fnance or  similar departments. Successful implementation of descriptive and diagnostic  analytics often leads the organization into a new direction of predictive and  diagnostic analytics: optimization. These are often accomplished with data  science, machine learning and AI platforms.   We have covered some very important considerations in this chapter. Most  of these you will not see covered in other texts, as these books are more  focused on the “how-to” deep dives into specifc algorithms. We felt it was  important to cover some very basic, somewhat philosophical foundations  before we launch into specifc data-driven methods and techniques.

Chapter 4  It’s All Analytics!   Keywords: Data, Descriptive Analytics, Predictive Analytics, Prescriptive  Analytics, Models, Causation, Correlation   Preamble   In the last chapter, we looked at processes that generate data and why we  want to collect that data. We contrasted models and algorithms and then  briefy touched on data and analytics architectures. We now look at how  almost everything we do is “Analytics” and thus we title this chapter “It’s    All Analytics.”   Overview of Analytics – It’s All Analytics      One of Scott’s  author  favorite quotes was from the movie Sneakers  see  Sneakers, 1992 , where Cosmo says “It’s about the data… Exactly! The  world isn't run by weapons anymore, or energy, or money, it's run by little  ones and zeroes, little bits of data. It's all just electrons.” But no, it is really  more than just the data! Data alone does nothing! Data by itself is just  a cost! Data costs include the cost to acquire it, the cost to store it, the legal  liability of keeping it, the potential risk of a data breach. We normally think  that data is cheap, but when you consider the total cost of ownership, it is  really quite expensive. And maybe only 15%–30% of data collected is ever  used  see Priceonomics, August 2019; Barrett, 2018 ; if it’s not used, it sits  there and does nothing  it is called “Dark Data” . So, it is only when your   95    96  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     action is based on data that you gain value from it; therefore – It’s about  the analytics and It’s All Analytics! You can only offset the costs of all  that data if you use it to the beneft of your interests.      Another great quote that is germane to this chapter is Wayne Gretzky’s  quote “Skate to where the puck is going, not where it has been.” It is not  understanding the past, but understanding what is going to happen in the  future; what’s next? That is the heart of predictive analytics, as we will see  in this chapter.   MUCH ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT!   “Companies  are  failing  in  their  efforts  to  become  data-driven”;  so  say  Randy Bean and Thomas Davenport in the Harvard Business Review on    February 5, 2019.  Why and How?   ◾  Becoming “Data-Driven” has been a goal of many during the past     ◾  Their larger goal is “Digital Transformation” and or “Competing on     decade or longer…   Analytics” and or “AI First”   ◾  BUT: managing data in all its forms is a prerequisite of the above     However, leading corporations are failing in their efforts to become  “data-driven,”  according  to  Bean  and  Davenport   2019   and  the  NewVantage Partners Big Data and AI Executive Survey  2019 . This sur- vey represented very large corporations such as American Express, Ford  Motor, General Electric, General Motors, and Johnson & Johnson. Results  of the survey included the following statistics:   ◾  72% of survey participants report that they have yet to forge a data     culture   ◾  69% report that they have not created a data-driven organization    ◾  53% state that they are not yet treating data as a business asset    ◾  52% admit that they are not competing on data and analytics    ◾  FURTHER: the percentage of frms identifying themselves as being    data-driven had declined in each of the past 3 years – from 37.1% in  2017 to 32.4% in 2018 to 31.0% in 2019   YET  –  many  of  these  corporations  were  investing  MORE  in  “Data   Analytic type of things,” as follows:    It’s All Analytics!  ◾  97           ◾  92% reported that the pace of their big data and AI investments were     accelerating   investment   ◾  88% report a greater urgency to invest in big data and AI    ◾  75% cite a fear of disruption as a motivating factor for big data AI     ◾  55%  of  companies  reported  investments  in  big  data  and  AI  now     exceed US$50MM, up from 40% just last year   ◾  Increases  in  the  appointment  of  Chief  Data  Offcers  from  12%  in     2012 to 68% in 2019   WHAT  are  the  OBSTACLES  to  adopting  a  fully  functioning  “Data-  Driven Organization”?   ◾  77% of executives report that adoption of Big Data AI initiatives is a     major challenge, up from 65% in 2018   ◾  only 7.5% of these executives cite technology as the challenge    ◾  93%  of  respondents  identify  people  and  process  issues  as  the     obstacles  –  40.3% identify lack of organization alignment as a leading obstacle      –  24% cite cultural resistance as a leading obstacle   Whatever the reasons for these failures in “Data-Driven Transformation,”   the following appears true:   ◾  The QUANTITY of data continues to rise in business and society    ◾  Analytical decisions and actions continue to be generally superior to     those based on intuition and experience   ◾  The companies in the survey are investing heavily in big data and     analytics   ◾  The need for data-driven organizations and cultures isn’t going away      Bean and Davenport, 2019    NOTE:  It  can  be  done!  We  address  successful  “Data-Driven  Organizations” in Chapter 2. Moreover, our next book is entirely  dedicated  to  the  design   architecture   and  implementation  of  a  successful analytics program. We are writing it specifcally to pro- vide a map for program success  see Burk and Miner, 2021 .          98  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Introduction   Analytics of Every Form and Analytics Everywhere   In a broad sense almost all the subjects in this book have some overlap with  analytics. For example, machine learning  Chapter 6  is the backbone of  predictive analytics, where we are trying to use data to deem the likelihood  of an unseen event. Another example is Visual business intelligence  BI    Chapter 5 , when data is turned into dashboards or what many term visual  analytics. And we can also look at data science, statistics, optimization or  other data-driven methods. Analytics touch them all.   Another example is a functional form of analytics, for example, “health-  care analytics.” Here we are not speaking of a discipline or type of analysis,  even if the data is an image, a video or the more common spreadsheet. We  are speaking across an entire spectrum of systems and processes that gener- ate petabytes of information and in which a myriad of interesting questions  and needs exist.   If you do an Internet search, you can easily fnd the following types of  analytics. We limit this list to 50, but there are many more. We offer defni- tions for most of these in our expansive glossary at the end of the book.   Analytics Mega List   We start our discussion here, by providing a list of different types of analyt- ics. Actually, this is not a full list! We went back and cut this list to the most  recent, most important top 50 names in analytics. You can fnd many others,  but many are complimentary or there is overlap.                          1  Analytics  2  Healthcare Analytics  3  Government Analytics  4  Medical Analytics  5  Public Health Analytics  6  Public Policy Analytics  7  Visual Analytics  8  Business Analytics  9  Customer Analytics  10  Descriptive Analytics  part 1 of Gartner   11  Diagnostic Analytics  part 2 of Gartner                            It’s All Analytics!  ◾  99           12   13   14   15   16   17   18   19   20   21   22   23   24   25   26   27   28   29   30   31   32   33   34   35   36   37   38   39   40   41   42   43   44   45   46     47 48   49     50      Predictive Analytics  part 3 of Gartner       Prescriptive Analytics  part 4 of Gartner       Advanced Analytics      Sports Analytics      Data Analytics      Big Data Analytics      Text Analytics      Graph Analytics      Social  Media  Analytics      Retail Analytics      Network Analytics      Link Analytics, Path Analytics      Modern Analytics      Directed Acyclic Graph  DAG  Analytics      Web and Digital Analytics      Security Analytics      Descriptive Analytics      Cognitive Analytics      Big Data Analytics      Embedded Analytics      Portfolio Analytics      Fraud Analytics      Marketing Analytics      Financial Analytics      Augmented Analytics      Customer Experience Analytics      Supply Chain Analytics      Geospatial Analytics      Call Center Analytics      Credit and Risk Analytics      Sales Analytics      Social Analytics      Audio Speech Analytics      Video  Content  Analytics      Image Analytics      Self-Service Analytics      Log Analytics      Search Analytics      Automated Analytics    100  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Whew! We provide a deeper dive into some of these later in this chapter;  skip there if it makes sense for you. However, we don’t want you as a reader  to be lost in the weeds, so it is your preference. We frst categorize some of  these terms in common classifcations.   Breaking it Down, Categorizing Analytics   Introduction   We provide a brief introduction here of analytic methods that classify things  into categories. This is very diffcult as there are methodological types of  analytics, functional types of analytics and analytics that address certain  types of data. To illustrate some diffculty in trying to categorize types of  analytics, take “text analytics” as an example. Text is a type of data, so it  could be a category of its own. Alternatively, it could be that we want to  determine the author of a text. There are many manuscripts attributable to  William Shakespeare, but what is the evidence, where is the specifc num- ber? Predictive analytics answers this question by learning the characteristics  of Shakespeare’s known works.   It could be that we want to autofll words in a search bar for Google,   Bing or DuckDuckGo. These search engines will use a method of machine  learning  n-grams  to attempt to guess the next word you want to enter –  this is search analytics, a functional type of analytics.   Therefore, text analytics encompasses many different types of analytics   depending on what you are attempting to do.   Below we describe an analytics classifcation scheme that is gener-  ally accepted. This scheme is ubiquitous in the analytics domain and is  often attributed to Gartner. It consists of four major categories of analyt- ics – Descriptive Analytics, Diagnostic Analytics, Predictive Analytics, and  Prescriptive Analytics. This framework is not comprehensive, nor completely  accurate, but it is useful. We use this as a general structure, but use our own  defnitions. We will also expand beyond it as we get further into this book.   Gartner’s Classifcation   Gartner, Inc. was founded in 1979. Its purpose is to equip executives across  the entire enterprise to make the right decisions at the right time, and  thus stay ahead of change in the world  Gartner, Inc., 2019 . It is a global    It’s All Analytics!  ◾  101           company serving over 15,600 client organizations in over 100 countries  around the world.   We will explore the four major groups of analytics that Gartner uses    Gartner 2019 . The following chart  Figure 4.1  demonstrates the relationship  of these four categories plus the concept of models that optimize a process.  It contains the evolution of these across three dimensions. First, as we move  from descriptive analytics to prescriptive analytics to the higher levels, we  require less human cognition  see Chapter 2, section “A Note on Cognition”   and more machine processing. In other words, computer processing and  algorithms replace the thinking required of humans and this requires more  machine processing. As we move from description and diagnosis to predic- tion, we are moving from looking in the rear view mirror  hindsight  to  looking through the windshield  foresight . And, fnally, as a general rule as  we move from the lower left to the upper right the value of these projects  increases.   In the following section, we go through each analytics superset in   sequence starting with descriptive analytics.   Descriptive Analytics   Descriptive analytics has a very long historical foundation. These analytics  are the easiest to implement, but many times do not offer the value of other  methods, which are generally more complex and sophisticated. Descriptive  analytics typically fall into one of the following categories:        1  Descriptive statistics and numerical summaries  2  Visual representation           According to Figure 4.1, descriptive analytics describes analytics as answer- ing the question, “What Happened?” However, descriptive analytics go well  beyond this question. They form the foundation for all the other analytics  categories, meaning that diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics, etc. all  start with descriptive analytics.   A simple example of a descriptive statistic is the average weight of a   male living in the United States. It provides a quick summary for millions  of individuals in one number. Its advantage is that it is a single number,    very easy to digest. Its disadvantage is the same. It does not provide any  idea of spread or nuances of the population. Spread and other nuances can  be done with several complimentary statistics  percentiles, variance, max,      102  ◾        It’s All Analytics!       Figure 4.1  A visual reference of a generally accepted classifcation scheme for  analytics.   min, etc. , but this also requires mental gymnastics to be able to understand  them.   A visual representation is often better than a set of summary statistics.   Humans are very good at processing visuals. This skill was developed over  millions of years of evolution. It is true that a picture is worth a thousand  words. We will dive much deeper into descriptive and visual analytics in  chapters on BI and statistics. However, we will see them in all chapters. BI  is about description – tables, reports, and Visual BI is graphs, dashboards,  interactive displays of information. In classical statistics, descriptive statistics    is one of two major divisions, the other being inferential statistics.   Diagnostic Analytics   Diagnostic analytics is a form of advanced analytics that examines data or  content to answer the question, “Why did it happen?” It is causal and  retrospective. It has causal meaning in that a change in an attribute  a cause   will generally or specifcally result in an observable change in a second attri- bute  the effect . Moreover, the cause must precede the effect. It is important  to note the difference in association or correlation with causation  see gray  box below on “Causation vs Correlation” .    It’s All Analytics!  ◾  103           CAUSATION VS CORRELATION   While the confusion over causation and correlation has improved over  the last few years, you can still see many examples by journalists and  other  authors  that  mix  the  meaning  of  the  two  concepts.  When  two  variables tend to run together, we say they are associated, they co-occur,  they are correlated. When one category of a variable is present, a second  variable category is often present. Or, in the case of numerical attributes,  when one variable increases the second variable increases  positive rela- tionship  or decreases  negative relationship .   It is very important to understand that correlations can be spurious,  meaning they can be caused by factors outside the two variables of inter- est. On the other hand, they can be sheer coincidence. There are billions  of variables so at times you can think something is correlated when in  fact, it is just chance. Causation on the other hand implies that there is  some sort of physical, psychological or underlying link.                  If you want some fun, we recommend that you check out Tyler Vigen’s  website at http:  tylervigen.com spurious-correlations. You will fnd a lot  of  interesting  spurious  correlations!  We  recreated  a  sample  of  this  in  the spirit of Tyler’s website. Figure 4.2 illustrates the relationship of U.S.  Spending  on  Science,  Space  and  Technology  vs  Suicides  by  Hanging,  Strangulation, and Suffocation.                     You  can  see  that  these  two  series  are  highly  correlated,  and  if  you  found it in a newspaper you might read that U.S. Spending is causing  suicides! Yes, this happens all the time when journalists and others con- fuse correlation vs causation.   Predictive Analytics   Predictive analytics answers the question, “What will happen?” Predictive  analytics is about assigning a probability or likelihood to an outcome based  on some type of analysis or model. The types of analysis or models that  result in predictive models will be presented in various chapters of this  book. Many predictive models today are generated with machine learning  algorithms. These models when given a set of inputs will generate the prob- ability of an outcome.   For example, the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics used patient  and operating room data to generate predictive models to determine the    104  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Figure 4.2  Spurious Correlations, U.S. Spending, and Suicides.      likelihood of surgical site infections developing from operations performed  in the operating room. The most interesting and innovative thing about this  model was that it was executed while the patient was still under anesthesia  in the operating room. The resulting probability in “Real Time” gave the care  team information they could use on what preventative treatment should be  used – normal closure of the wound, delayed closure or negative pressure  therapy  Siwicki, 2018 . Relationships between targets and predictors in pre- dictive models may be correlated or causal in nature.   Prescriptive Analytics   Gartner notes prescriptive analytics is a form of advanced analytics,  which examines data or content to answer the question “What should be  done?” or “What can we do to make XYZ happen?” This type of analytics  requires good data and maybe additional assumptions. We will cover this  more deeply in chapters where we apply algorithms to create prescriptive  models.    It’s All Analytics!  ◾  105           The difference between predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics is  often misunderstood. Prescriptive analytics requires causality. It is important  to understand the differences and we created a special gray box to cover  these  please see “Predictive or Prescriptive??” gray box .   Process Optimization   Optimization is a word that is overused a lot these days. I optimized my      workout. We use the word optimization in a very strict, rigorous way. We  will explore this concept in depth later, but in general we start with an    objective function that we explicitly state. We state whether we want to    maximize or minimize this function – this is optimization. We add con- straints that cannot be violated. We then search for solutions that maximize    or minimize our function and do not violate our constraints. The solution    has the highest or lowest value of the objective function is the optimal    solution.   PREDICTIVE OR PRESCRIPTIVE??   One of the most misunderstood differences is the classifcation of predic- tive vs prescriptive analytics. We have seen experienced data scientists  mix this up. There is a big difference in these models. We will not get  technical, but if you learn this – you will be ahead of many profes- sionals in the analytics space!   First, some similarities in the method classifcations:   1  Both  predictive  analytics  and  prescriptive  analytics  apply  to  unseen     events  most are future or forward looking        2  They both contain a probability of an outcome  probabilistic models   3  Both often provide highly valuable insights   Then, some dissimilarities in the method classifcations:   1  Prescriptive models are causal; predictive models may or may not be  2  Predictive models are generally easier to formulate  3  Prescriptive  models  require  special  assumptions  or  special  data  to         formulate                   106  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Prescriptive models are the gold standard since they are causal, and  thus manipulating factors that cause the outcome results in a higher prob- ability of success. For example, in healthcare, it is known that prescribing  antibiotics will generally reduce bacterial infections.   What  is  an  example  of  a  predictive  model  that  is  not  prescriptive?  Imagine  an  Internet  retailer  that  wants  to  sell  products  or  services  off  their  website,  and  they  have  a  loyalty  program  called  “elite  rewards.”  It turns out, not surprisingly, that a customer in their elite rewards  an  annual  fee  required   membership  is  a  very  important  variable  in  their  predictive model to determine if they will be more likely to respond to  an email offer.   Now,  a  naïve  marketer  might  think  –  “We  need  to  push  these  cus- tomers into our loyalty program so we can sell to them more frequently  – they will respond more receptively to our email ads.” This is the idea  behind prescriptive analytics, i.e. what should I do, what actions s  should  I take? They might incentivize existing customers that are not in their elite  program with a free account. Could they now expect the same results,  e.g.  the  same  likelihood  of  purchase  as  their  predictive  model  would  have suggested? No. Why? Because they have not changed the customer’s  behavior  or  mindset.  Customers  that  are  willing  to  pay  for  the  “elite”  program are inherently different from customers that are not. However,  offering an easy path to elite membership does not change the likelihood  to respond to an offer. This is an example of a confused marketer using  a predictive model as if it were prescriptive.   Again, understanding the difference will make you well ahead of the   pack in understanding analytics.   Some Additional Thoughts on Classifying Analytics   There are three ways to classify analytics:   1  What domain or function? Public health analytics, public policy analyt-  2  What type of data is used? Text analytics, graph analytics, image analyt-  3  What analytics problem? Descriptive, diagnostics, predictive and pre-             ics, sports analytics    ics, web analytics    scriptive analytics    It’s All Analytics!  ◾  107           Again, in order to classify the types of analytics we are using, we need    to look at many things from the domain under consideration, functions,    formats of data available and the nature of the problem, whether descrip- tive, diagnostic, predictive and or prescriptive. We have to think these    things through thoroughly to make sure we are in the ballpark of our    problem.   Fundamentals of Analytics – Data Basics   Introduction   Recall that in Chapter 3, we discussed data and processes. If we want to  make better decisions and improve processes, we collect data, analyze it,  model it, create insights and then use those insights.   We cover a lot of disciplines and methods in this book. We do so   because you need many different tools in your toolbox so you can pull out  the right tool for the right job. However, it is helpful if we can fnd some  common elements in the problems we are trying to solve. After all, It’s All  Analytics. There are commonalities across the different analytic methods.  We will cover some basic ideas of categorization   classifcation of data.  After all, data are the building blocks, the new oil, and we will be talking  about data through the book. Understanding using data helps us make good  decisions.   Four Scales of Measurement   At a very basic level, data can take on four levels of measurement. These are  important because they dictate the type of analysis one can use given the  data they acquire. We present them in order:               1  Nominal Scale – by “name” only, they have no numeric value. This     is the lowest scale of measurement. There is no order of elements and  measurements are qualitative. An example is color – red, green, blue.    2  Ordinal Scale – similar to nominal in that there is no explicit numeric      relationship except measurements of this type have order. Measurements  are qualitative. Example, runners in a sprint place 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.    tion the relative distance between the numbers on the scale are equal   3  Interval Scale – interval data has not only order, but also in addi-         108  ◾        It’s All Analytics!      proportional  and can be evaluated mathematically. Measurements are  quantitative. Example – proft. It can be positive, negative or zero and  a doubling of proft is the same if you move from US$10 to US$20 or  US$2M to US$4M.    4  Ratio Scale – the highest scale, ratio scale has the characteristics of  the interval scale and has a true zero. Measurements are quantitative.  Example – Height. You cannot have a zero or negative height.         Data Formats   Data formats may refer to data types, recording and content formats, fle for- mats and more. We will discuss a few of these here. Specifcally, we would  like to provide a broad brush on data formats that form the basis for cer-   tain type of analytics. The following list illustrates some data formats that  often drive the type of analytics performed:              1  Words  2  Numeric  3  Images   Pictures  4  Video  5  Audio   Sounds              Data Format   Example of Analytics Applied   Words   Numeric   Images    Pictures   Text Analytics, Natural Language, Search Analytics, Web Analytics   Healthcare Analytics, Business Analytics, Risk Analytics, Financial  Analytics   Image Analytics, Sports Analytics, Visual Analytics, Geospatial  Analytics   Audio   Sound   Voice Recognition Transcription, Security Analytics, Call Center  Analytics   Video   Video Analytics, IoT and Smart Cities, Retail Analytics, Streaming  Analytics   There has been a major shift in the types of data used for analysis. Forty  years ago, almost all data analyzed was numerical or categorical  quantitative  and qualitative  in nature. Healthcare and businesses were full of numeri- cal data that was being analyzed by the adoption of computing technology.  Ten to twenty years later, as computers got much faster, there was a greater    It’s All Analytics!  ◾  109           adoption of “number crunching” and data mining, and there was an explo- sion of text analytics. In the last year, there has been a huge increase in  image recognition, audio, video, and streaming analytics.   File formats refer to structures that a computer can read. It allows pro-  grams to identify and load different data formats from the list above as well  as mixtures of these data formats. Some computer fle extension examples  are *.csv, *.txt. *.xml, *.mdf, *.html, *.log, and many, many more.   Data Stores   Processes generate data and we record that data. It exists in non-permanent  memory sometimes called temporary memory or volatile memory, which  used immediately and then deleted. For example, think of fles on your com- puter that are created, but not saved. That data exists in temporary memory   RAM  that is only referenceable while the computer is on. If you want to  access that data later, you must store it.   Most analytics data is stored at least temporarily. All analytics develop-  ment can be thought of as using data storage. We just want to provide  a quick list of data storage locations now, as this can dictate the type of  method that is used. Here are a few examples most applicable to analytics:                  1  Local fles. Spreadsheets, databases, text, xml, html  2  Relational databases on premise  3  Semi-structured  non-lake  databases on premise  JSON, XML, logs,         NoSQL       Infrastructure and Platform as a service     since streaming analytics is growing rapidly   4  Data lake, big data stores  Apache and Hadoop, see Chapter 9   5  Cloud Storage options  Software as a Service, Database as a Service,   6  Streaming data – This is more of a connector than storage; noted here   The authors are in the process of writing a book dedicated to the “architec- ture of technology” to support data science, AI and analytics activities. The  entire book is dedicated to the subject; please look for it.   Provisioning Data for Analytics   We are not going to cover all activities that should be covered in an analyt- ics project; however, we believe it is benefcial to cover some of the basic  data provisioning activities for these projects. You will hear similar names    110  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     for some of these activities, like data wrangling, data munging, etc. Let us  address a few activities that are common in many analytics projects.        1  Data Sourcing     a.  Identifcation of Project Data  led by business   b.  Data Engineering  technical aspects          2  Data Quality Assessment and Remediation  3  Data Integration  4  Data Cleaning of Merged Data      Once the project begins there will be additional activities:   5  Exploratory Data Analysis  6  Data Transformation  7  Data Reduction  8  Rinse and Repeat Where Necessary                                       The following demonstrates what we call “the data cycle”  see Figure 4.3 . It  is highly iterative and may be recursive at any point.   Figure 4.3  The “Data Cycle” Copyright   2019 by Scott Burk.       It’s All Analytics!  ◾  111           Data Sourcing      There are two parts to data sourcing. The frst part is determining the  data you will need. What is the right data needed to support an analyt- ics project? Remember CRISP-DM in Chapter 3? If not, that is okay; we will  revisit the initial stages of the analytics process in the section on business  understanding and project defnition. What is an important result that the  business would beneft from achieving? Is it attainable in a realistic time  horizon? Who would need to be involved in the process, which members  from what groups? IT, and which business leaders? Which technical people?  What would the metrics be to support the answer? How would you know  you arrived at the destination? As Dr. Tom Hill  a friend of the authors  says,    “How would we know we won? How would we know we are done?”      If it helps, begin with the end in mind and work backward. What would   be the decision or the action needed to bring about the fnal result? Then,  at the next step backward: What analysis would deliver the information to  determine that decision or action? Then one more step backward: What data  would be required for that analysis?   Once you know what data elements are needed to support the project,   you move to the second part, which is data sourcing, connecting and  returning the data to an analytics sandbox. This sandbox could take several  forms; it is normally just a database that is separated from transactional sys- tems. First, you must ask if you can access the data you need? If so, who can  source it? If not, is there surrogate data that will provide a close approxima- tion or good enough information? If not, you might need to set this project  aside for a time while you can work on getting those pipes installed and in  the meantime select another target project.   Data Quality Assessment and Remediation   Scott attended a data quality conference in California in the year 2003. This      conference was attended by hundreds, possibly thousands of people across  the globe. It is where Scott met his frst friend from New Zealand. The entire    conference was entirely dedicated to data quality. THIS WAS OVER 15 YEARS    AGO, and yet it is amazing that this issue of “Quality in Data” still exists and      in fact, may be worse than it was 15 years ago. You would have thought that  with that kind of following, i.e. hundreds to thousands of researchers around    the world concerned with “data quality,” and with books dedicated to the    subject  see English, 2009 , the problem would have gotten much better.    Once you have data in an analytics sandbox, you need to determine the   quality of the data. Let’s examine fve common issues in data quality    which will form your assessment:   112  ◾        It’s All Analytics!                1  Record Duplication    2  Sparsity  3  Outliers  4  Invariance  5  Redundancy              Duplication exists in transactional systems and when data is merged across  systems. At this point you will have not merged data, but you should do a  frst pass at the sourcing and bring in the data  called staging and provision- ing by data scientists . As the old quality paradigm goes, the more you can  move quality toward the beginning of a system, the more time and money  you can save.   Duplicates can be exact copies appearing in multiple rows. This is very   easy to fx by the IT department. Or, it could be caused by “similar” records.  An example for a similar record could be a patient master index that has  Sarah S. Jones in one record and Sarah Sue Jones in another record, and  they are actually records for the same person. Suppose that Sarah went to an  out-of-network provider and flled the form out with Sara Sue Jones. When  this record was brought in, the patient master was not smart enough to  identify it as the same Sara S. Jones so it created a new record. Interestingly,  there are systems that use machine learning to help alleviate this issue.   Sparsity is missing data. You can have row or column sparsity; this   means you are missing several elements for a record across a row. You  might have several missing values for a variable  column of data . If you  imagine your data in a spreadsheet  see Table 4.1  with 10 variables  10  columns ; then the Patient ID forms a row for the other 9 variables. In our  fgure, patient 3333 is missing data for two columns, for example. You must  decide how to handle missing values for your modeling projects. The easiest  way to handle it is to throw out rows or columns, but this may weaken the  signal or amount of information you need for project success. Alternatively,  there are many ways to handle missing values: replacing with averages, aver- age frequency categories, use of an imputation model to fll data and many  more methods are options to handle these issues  good predictive analytic  software packages can do this “automatically,” with the user having the abil- ity to specify which type of method to handle missing data is desired .

Outliers are another problem where a few values can throw off statis-  tics. You can test for these in a variety of ways and intelligently replace them  with values more tenable for your analysis needs. All of these have draw- backs: missing data has its costs, but it does not have to derail your project  unless your data is really lacking.   Invariance is when you have a categorical variable  nominal or interval   that has either all or almost all the same values. Imagine you have a column  for Gender and 99% of your data is female. This would cause problems  if you used this column for modeling. It is best to see if you can increase  the male instances, throw out the entire variable, or apply some sort of  oversampling. Or, if the variable is numeric, and it has very little wiggle  a  not-so-technical term for variance , it could also be discarded, as there is  not enough variance to be of much or any value in statistics and modeling.  Suppose the class average is 99 with a low score of 98 and a high score of  100 – this variable will be of little use in any analysis.   Last on our list is redundancy. There are analytic methods that do not   work well if you have highly correlated predictors. Example, suppose I want  to predict annual income with four predictor variables. These predictors are  age in years, highest degree completed, number of years of education and  whether the occupation was science technical vs non-science non-technical.  The highest degree completed and the number of years of education are  likely to be highly correlated and contain the same information in trying to  predict annual income. Therefore they are redundant and we would likely  want to get rid of one of them or at least note it and not use both of them in  a model that might be susceptible to problems with redundancy.   Other issues can occur in the data for your project. For example, your   data can be stale, out of date. You cannot account for every possible nuance  in advance, as data discovery is a process. However, with a good team  working together, you can discover them and correct for them, thus adding  value to your project.   Integrate and Repeat   Data integration is joining various data sets together. It is often needed to  get customer demographic data from one system, transactional sales data  from another system and more… Most analytics are performed on a single,  monolithic set of data – wide and deep. You will typically need to join this  data together. A data engineer, an IT data base guru or a savvy business  analyst can help with this activity. You will stage these tables in the analytic    It’s All Analytics!  ◾  115           sandbox for additional processing. Different data tables, each with different  data from the same subject, can be “joined” into one table; these joins are  done such that one row will represent a customer, a patient or an event.   Once you have this complete data set formulated, it is necessary to repeat   at minimum a couple of the data quality steps. Once you have the pro- cess formulated it should not be diffcult to repeat all steps, but it is criti- cal to look for row duplicates, since joining several data tables or data fles  together increases the likelihood that you will have more of them.   Exploratory Data Analysis  EDA    Once you have the data sourced and fxed many of the data quality issues   you should know that this is a continuing process; like parenthood, you are  never done , you can start the fun stuff. We illustrate a system for most ana- lytics at this point – note in this book we cover over a half-dozen methods.  Furthermore, we are assuming a more insight-driven process rather than an  automated one. Methods like autoML will be discussed in future chapters.  Exploratory data analysis is very akin to descriptive analytics. We com-  pute summary statistics, we continue to look for outliers, but now we look  at them in a different lens; we start to see data in a multidimensional way,  where rather than one data point outside its neighbors, we look if it has an  unwieldy effect on other variables. This can be very interesting and lead to  immediate wins of the analytics project. This should be underscored – you  want to celebrate wins from the EDA phase. This is the time where the ana- lytics team can go back to the business and thus demonstrate the value of  analytics to the entire enterprise – the entire membership of the company  or organization. You want a place where you record all these successes. At  times, the end deliverables may not be as stellar as hoped, but what might  seem small insights can have a huge payoff. Deloitte reported in 2019 a  study that increased data capture and analysis can likely save billions of dol- lars for the energy industry.      As with most of the analytics process, this is never complete. The initial   pass may be the most time consuming and provide the greatest insights, but  it usually needs to be revisited. Here are some goals from EDA:         1  What are the relationships among the predictors and what is being pre-    dicted  target ?    come? If so, investigate, and share with the business if applicable. If this   2  Are there any data points that highly infuence leverage a target out-   116  ◾        It’s All Analytics!                                            leads to business insight or action, record this as a win for the team and  try to measure the impact in a quantitative measure – money savings,  money growth.      tional data to make a more accurate prediction?     3  We need to look at interactions .  4  Are we correctly accounting for the relationships? Do we need addi-  5  Are we asking the right questions? So important, we will repeat.   Data Transformations   Data transformations are formulas applied to variables or combinations of  variables. A few examples are:   1  Indicator creation or dummy coding  2  Logarithmic or mathematical transformations  3  Normalization  4  Statistical standardization  5  Binning of continuous variable ranges  thus converted into categorical             variables          6  Aggregation  7  Generalization  8  Masking   de-identifcation for privacy   Data Reduction   Data reduction refers to eliminating variables that cannot or should not be  used in the analysis. It may be discovered in the data preparation phase that  certain variables should be eliminated for:   1  Ethical reasons  2  Legal reasons  3  Public relations  4  Insuffcient utility for the problem being addressed  5  Future censoring – data is available historically, but not in the future  6  Expense – the data exists, but is cost prohibitive going forward                   A second type of data reduction is done in the modeling or analysis phase  to pare down the data set so that models can execute more timely and the  analysis of the results is more effcient. Statistical and machine learning algo- rithms usually aid these reductions.    It’s All Analytics!  ◾  117           In this chapter we have looked at an “overview” of the ANALYTICS  PROCESS with special emphasis on getting and cleaning data. In the next  chapter, we get into the specifcs of BI, in particular Visual BI.   Postscript   References   Barrett, J. April 2018. “Up to 73 percent of company data goes unused for analytics.

Chapter 5  What Are Business  Intelligence  BI  and Visual BI?   Keywords: Reporting, Visual Analytics, On-line Analytical Processing   OLAP , Dashboards   In the last chapter, we looked at all the various types of analytics – and It    Is All Analytics! From analyzing unstructured information like text, to  images, to structured information in relational databases. We now cover an  old, but very important part of analytics, Business Intelligence  BI , and what  is even more important these days – Visual BI.   Preamble   Introduction   Let us start with an overview of where BI fts into the analytics picture. One  thing for sure, people love current BI technology! An important takeaway of  this chapter is that BI is not an island unto itself and it is not “old school.” It  fts inside an analytics ecosystem. We will see it is extremely useful in the  beginning and end of any analytics project. And it is at the tip of the spear  in most business applications meaning users are interacting with BI at the  user interface even though under the covers there may be much deeper and  complex things happening.   119    120  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     We begin this chapter with this brief introduction, then we launch into  a brief history. We will need this because we are going to talk about three  major evolutions in the area of BI. There are so many different ways to cat- egorize the subject based on functionality and uses. However, we provide  three broad strokes:          1  Basic Reporting  2  A View inside the Data Warehouse and Interactive BI  3  Beyond the Data Warehouse and Enhanced Interactive – Visual BI and            more   NOTE: Today’s BI platforms will likely include at least some advanced  statistical and machine learning methods. So, while a vendor may include  machine learning in their BI platform, that does not make machine learning  part of the BI domain in our opinion. We are making this distinction in the  core precepts of BI and its involvement, as we proceed in this chapter.   NOTE: Another distinction – there are two favors of BI in this chapter,   but we will often just say BI:   Operational BI – BI that is inserted into everyday processes and   enhances business understanding and operational decision-making. It  includes reports and dashboards are typically executed on a schedule  or based on an event trigger.   Project-Based BI – This is where BI is used as part of the data science  project to augment and improve the analytics project. Here, BI is often  used in the beginning and end of an analytics project. Through this, we  often come to understand the interrelationships and outside forces that  act upon the enterprise by a discovery process. An old term for this that  still applies today is Exploratory Data Analysis  EDA . It is also used  at the end of the process to present the results of the project and then  again, it is often operationalized.      BI allows professionals to explore the organization’s data easily, quickly and  interactively. Today it is almost as easy as Tom Cruise in Minority Report    in the scene with the holograms  see gray box on “BI for Movie Buffs” ,    and in the near future it might be similar to Michael Crichton’s Disclosure,  where virtual reality  VR  can assist you with your analytic needs  see “BI  for Movie Buffs” .    What Are BI and Visual BI?  ◾  121           BI FOR MOVIE BUFFS   If you have not seen it, there is a flm, Minority Report  see Molen, 2002 ,    starring Tom Cruise and directed by Steven Spielberg. The flm is set in the    future, 2054, and Washington DC’s prototype PreCrime police department      stops  murderers  before  they  act,  reducing  the  murder  rate  to  zero.  The  crime is predicted and police arrive at the scene before the crime actually    occurs. There is a great scene where Tom Cruise is swiping holographic      images before him. These images are essentially equivalent to today’s visual  dashboard. He easily selects a small image and twists it with his fngers    and the image expands. He ficks his fnger and the image is kicked off the      screen. He swipes an entire image across with the palm of this hand. He  is viewing a dashboard, a complete set of images, tables and more in mul- tiple panels. The flm will soon be 20 years old, so it was well before the    creation of the modern dashboard. Most users of BI today cannot access      holographic computer screens, but they can manipulate windows of visual  data and repeat virtually every move Cruise made with a mouse rather    than a hand and completely interact with the underlying data.   Another flm that was well ahead of its time in capturing analytics on    screen was Michael Crichton’s Disclosure  see Crichton, 1994 . Here the flm    shows  Michael  Douglas  wearing  a  VR  headset  and  glove  and  accessing      databases with the help of a digital angel that assists him in his efforts. This    is a 1994 flm. While we are not quite there, many of these components  exist and it may not be long before analytics professionals are donning VR    headsets and navigating the analytics landscape in virtual dimensions.   A fnal comment that is very important: One of the common threads for   the explosion of interactive BI was the invention of the data warehouse.  Organizations in the 1980s were having problems with too many stories  brought into the conference room. People were bringing their personal  reports into departmental and boardroom meetings. A presentation or dis- cussion would start and then battles would rage – “your report is junk and  my numbers are right!” This leads to a search for a “single version of the  truth.” How do you do this when you have so many different systems and  a lot of overlapping data? You have corporate systems, departmental sys- tems, systems accessed on the Internet. There was a two-part solution. The    frst part was the data warehouse – it would determine the correct source  system for a given data element. If a customer or patient ID was located in    122  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     multiple systems it would identify how and where to source “the golden  record”  a single, well-defned version of all the data entities in an organi- zational ecosystem . The second part of creating a single version of the  truth is to corporately defne transformations  formulas or manipulation after  the data extraction . For consuming the data, this is often done within the  BI system itself. If this is done properly, someone accessing the data will be  sourcing the right measures  quantitative  and the right dimensions  qualita- tive  – thus these represent a “single source of the truth.”   One note here: we are approaching BI primarily in roles that develop the   end products and consume the end products of BI. We are not referring to  IT or database professionals that create infrastructure for platforms.   Background and Chronology   As Christina Lago’s article “150 Years of Business Intelligence: A Brief History”     see Lago, 2018  described, you guessed it: BI is old, its recording dates back    to 1865 when it was written that Sir Henry Furnese had exceeded the compe- tition by collecting, analyzing and using information to help him make bet- ter business decisions. We will not be that granular, but as we stated we will    illustrate three waves of evolution which provided purpose and capability:          1  Basic Reporting  2  A View inside the Data Warehouse and Interactive BI  3  Beyond the Data Warehouse and Enhanced Interactive – Visual BI and            more   Basic  Digital  Reporting   The digital revolution started in the 1950s and reporting was there along its    side. At the time, we are sure it was impressive. It continued to evolve and    the frst BI appeared on the scene in the 1970s. Most of this type of report- ing was printed reports. We will call this Version 1.0. While we moved much    reporting to a digital format, if you look around you will see there are still a    lot of paper reports being generated. Healthcare is a BIG paper user. Have    you ever observed how many people are walking around with a clipboard in    a hospital clinical setting? Government is another notorious printer of paper    – see all of the reports, public records, and documents they create and dis- seminate. Did anyone else cringe when legislators were on TV with the 2,700    pages of the Affordable Care Act  ACA ? Moreover, this was just the ACA. If      What Are BI and Visual BI?  ◾  123           you add the associated regulations of the ACA, there were around 20,000    pages and it is likely you can fnd printed copies of those as well.   A View inside the Data Warehouse and Interactive BI   Then in the 1980s, the data warehouse began to arrive on the scene. While  BI offcially predates the data warehouse, the data warehouse was neces- sary to get “buy-in” because of the “multiple versions of the truth” problem  we introduced in an opening section to this chapter. Once the marriage  of the data warehouse and BI were shown to be so powerful, the adop- tion of both exploded. Bill Inmon and Ralph Kimble became famous as  the “fathers” of data warehousing  while they took different approaches,    they are responsible for the modern data warehouse . In addition, Howard  Dresner of the Gartner Group popularized the term “BI.” He described it as  “concepts and methods to improve business decision-making by using fact- based support systems.”      There are versions and ways to classify the chronology and evolution of BI     e.g., BI 1.0, BI 2.0, etc.  and you can fnd them on the Internet; we have our    own categorization. From our perspective, the three major changes beyond    basic reporting created a new era of BI for versions 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0. Version    2.0 consisted of marrying the data warehouse with a powerful and interac- tive user interface. Therefore, this section is the second wave when these two      forces came into the picture. By interactivity, we mean the ability to slice and  dice the data on the fy by the user. Basic reports are static, meaning once the    report is generated, the user cannot change it on the fy; they have to change    the base confguration. By allowing users to interact with their reports they    could answer questions immediately by this slicing and dicing. For example,    suppose we have a two-dimensional table of revenue. From left to right are    fve time periods, 2016 to 2020, and down the left are four regions in the    United States  Northeast, South, Midwest, and West . Looking at this table, I    might immediately have a question on what is happening in the South. I can    re-query my BI tool and the tool will drill down into that zone only, showing    me all the customers in that region for example.   WHAT ALLOWS A DATA MART OR DATA  WAREHOUSE TO SLICE AND DICE DATA   Online  Analytic  Processing   OLAP   is  a  cornerstone  of  the  data  ware- house. It is the technology behind many BI applications. It allows for a    124  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     multidimensional analysis of data – the slicing and dicing, which is slid- ing through a data structure, i.e., hierarchies, as well as across them. It  allows for limitless report creation and complex analytical calculations.  The  term  is  attributed  to  Edgar  Todd  and  frst  appeared  in  1993.  You  will hear terms like OLAP Cube, which is a visual reference to the way  the data is structured – a cubic structure with the dimensions along the  edges of the cube and facts and measures inside the cube. The following   extremely simple  cube has different salespeople, items sold and brands  and  these  can  differ  across  the  various  branches.  The  cube  allows  for  high-performance retrieval of the data  Figure 5.1 .   IMPORTANT NOTE: Data mining, machine learning, and artifcial  intelligence   AI   model  training  is  performed  against  very  wide,  very  long data structures. OLAP requires very narrow tables for a very quick  return of data. These data structures require almost divergent poles of  data form. That is another reason so much of an analyst’s time is spent  around data processing.   OLAP  is  contrasted  against  Online  Transaction  Processing   OLTP .  OLTP is very good at storing data, i.e., loading a database transaction by  transaction – imagine sitting in front of someone inputting data in front  of a computer screen. For example, sales order entries, clinical appoint- ment systems and the DMV  Department of Motor Vehicles  are all well  served  by  OLTP.  However,  pulling  data  out  of  a  database  quickly  and  easily requires a different data structure. OLAP was invented to extract  data with ease, speed, and fnesse.   Figure 5.1  An extremely simple example of an OLAP  multidimensional  cube.       What Are BI and Visual BI?  ◾  125           Beyond the Data Warehouse and Enhanced    Interactive Visual BI and More   In the third evolutionary wave, all of what was available in Version 2.0 is also    available in Version 3.0, but additionally, there are two major improvements.    First, the BI in tables and basic charts becomes much more visually impactful    and malleable. Secondly, visual objects are highly interactive. This means that    the re-query mentioned above is as easy as clicking on a bar in a bar chart      or histogram. The dashboard becomes the visual interface. To be sure, there  were graphics, charts, and images available in Version 2.0, but there was a    major change in the ways these became useable with the BI Version 3.0.   STORYTELLING WITH DATA   Storytelling is an important part of human existence. People love stories.  People  are  moved  by  stories.  When  you  just  show  people  charts  and  graphs, it does not resonate. But, if you can tell someone a story, it helps  people to relate. Florence Nightingale knew this. She had witnessed the  carnage of the Crimean War and she realized most soldiers died not from  combat, but infection and disease. It changed her life. It became her mis- sion to reform nursing and the sanitation of hospitals. To convince the  British Parliament and Queen Victoria to invest in better sanitary condi- tions she did so by telling a story with illustrations. She raised millions in  today’s dollars through the power of story.   With today’s BI technology, storytelling with data is easier than ever.    In  fact,  there  are  entire  books  dedicated  to  this  skill.  In  Storytelling  with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals, Cole  Nussbaumer Knafic provides a recipe and tips on how to create a proper  story with data. But she points out it does not start with technology –  “This may sound counterintuitive, but success in data visualization does  not start with data visualization… time should be paid to understanding  the context.” And of course understanding context is fundamental to any  good storytelling.

Gartner coined the phrase BAM  business    126  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     activity monitoring  several years ago, but the capabilities continue to evolve.  According to Gartner’s online glossary  www.gartner.com en information-tec      hnology glossary bam-business-activity-monitoring :                                               Business activity monitoring  BAM  describes the processes and  technologies that enhance situation awareness and enable analy- sis of critical business performance indicators based on real-time  data. BAM is used to improve the speed and effectiveness of busi- ness operations by keeping track of what is happening and mak- ing issues visible quickly. The BAM concept can be implemented  through many different kinds of software tools; those aimed solely  at BAM are called “BAM platform products.   Two technologies that we will mention in Chapter 9 are real-time data and  event-driven data. These technologies have enabled BAM. BAM is in the cat- egory of operational BI we defned at the beginning of the chapter.   This is a very short and simplistic four-version scenario for the status and   evolution of BI. You can dive into the subject as deep your interests take  you. We offer some interesting references at the end of the chapter as well  as resources in the “Resources for the Avid Learner” section.   Strengths and Weaknesses of BI   Before we get into specifc strengths and weaknesses, let us point out some  characteristics could be strengths or weaknesses of BI based on the intent of  the user. We will focus on the application of visual dashboards in the orga- nization by a designer since they are currently so popular.   Transparency and Single Version of the Truth   First, visual dashboards can offer a great deal of transparency, because there  are no complex mathematical models to explain. If designed properly the  dashboard speaks for itself. If it is not evident what the designer is trying    to demonstrate, the display can even be annotated or commented upon.  Second, if the data is curated and sourced properly into the Visual BI sys- tem then it should represent the intent of the measures agreed upon by the  enterprise.    What Are BI and Visual BI?  ◾  127           However, the design and intent may totally negate these potential strengths     of the BI system. Suppose I am a department manager and BI user. As a    BI user, I may want to create a presentation which will bolster the chances    of me getting my next year’s budget increased. I can certainly game which    data to use and how I construct the visuals so it distorts the truth and shores    up my story. “Lies, damned lies and statistics” has been attributed  possibly    incorrectly  to Benjamin Disraeli and popularized by Mark Twain. Had BI    been around in his day he may have included dashboards within the quote.  The point – instead of letting the numbers tell the story, the story  is told by “cherry-picking” which numbers to use, the types of dis- plays, the way the display is organized; I have a story in mind and then  use the visualization to try to tell “my” story. This can be done with statistics  and many other methods. However, it is really deceptive with Visual  BI because people can see with their own eyes!!! How can numbers  lie if I see the results in a heat map  a type of Visual BI plot ? The rela- tionship is there! Yet, how many other dozens of heat maps might  have been available out of the same data set? Are there confgura- tion options chosen that enhance the intent of the author? This is  extremely easy to do in Visual BI.   NOTE: There are dozens of books on the misuse and misinterpretation of   statistics. For example, Darrell Huff wrote How to Lie with Statistics in 1954  for the general reader. Huff was a journalist, not a statistician, and wrote  many “how-to” articles as a freelance author  see also Huff and Geis, 1993 .   In corporate systems where a championed dashboard of company  metrics runs on a cycle, there are far fewer issues. However, for the  departmental or board meeting, caveat emptor or buyer beware.  We will explain what we mean, but to summarize, there are several   strengths of BI:                      1  Humans are geared to seeing visual relationships and getting it  2  Humans love to play with things, interact  3  Many people start their analytics careers in BI  4  Tools are very mature, easy to use and powerful  5  Very little training is needed, very intuitive  6  Little processing is needed compared to machine learning and AI  7  May offer “A single version of the truth,” may be transparent  8  Interlaces the analytics process, especially data science projects  9  BI is big and broad                       128  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Humans are geared to seeing visual relationships   Over hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, humans have developed  the ability to see relationships very quickly. As the old saying goes, a picture  is worth a thousand words. We can scan through visual dashboards and see  where things tend to be pointing, and may call these the “main points” of  the visualization, when in fact they may be “non-signifcant.” We can also  quickly see outliers and nuances in the visual data, but again these may be  non-signifcant, unless error bars or confdence limits  CL  are presented as  part of the visualization  which they usually are not in most of the BI tools  we have seen .   Humans love to play with things, interact   We think one of the most appealing points of BI to people is the idea that  you can play with the data. You can click on an object in a visual dash- board and throughout the display, every related object will be repopulated  like magic. You can click for hours. This allows you to “play” with the data.  You can “drill down” and “fnd new things”   “new knowledge” – BUT is  this really new knowledge if there are no statistics of signifcance associated  with the visualizations?   Many people start their analytics careers in BI   BI is a natural starting place for analytics professionals to begin their careers.  This is interrelated with the intuitive nature of BI as just mentioned. People  are great at seeing relationships in images. From this launching point, a  professional can go in many directions. As we will see in the data science  chapter  Chapter 8 , someone may be more interested in the data engineer- ing side or they may like the statistical side or move into other evolving BI  areas like development.   Tools are very mature, easy to use and powerful   BI software has existed for 50 years. There is a lot of competition in the      feld and so the “ease of use” and stability are very good. They can scale  to the largest enterprise and today BI systems may contain machine learn- ing and other tools that can add signifcance and truth to what the user is    viewing.    What Are BI and Visual BI?  ◾  129           Very little training is needed, very intuitive   This is why many people start their careers in BI: there is a low training  threshold to cross compared to many of the other analytic techniques. But if  one stays at this level many mistakes in understanding “reality – truth” in the  data can happen, so it is imperative that people understand that what one  sees visually has to be shown to be true or false by signifcance measures   Nisbet, Yale, and Miner, 2018 .   Little processing is needed compared to machine learning and AI   Everything is relative, and depending on the problem, the size of the      enterprise and many other variables, the computing requirements will  vary, but will be much less intensive than machine learning and espe- cially AI and deep learning requirements. If desired there are many    cloud options where sizing and computing can be adjusted dynamically.    However, in this day and age of plentiful computer storage space and fast    computing, the machine learning analysis can take place in fractions of    seconds, so the “intensiveness” is not a hindrance to doing good analysis.    In addition, the data preparation  which is 80–90% of the time involved    in any data analytics  has to be done for the Visual BI anyway  which is    the same fnal data that is also used for the machine learning and AI deep    learning methods .   MAY offer “A single version of the truth”   We have already explained that the data warehouse and BI were cre- ated to provide a “single version of the truth.” Yet, as with many tech- niques, it is not bulletproof. Tools in the hands of a knowledgeable    user can game the system to paint the picture to justify their position or    objective.   Interlaces the analytics process, especially data science projects   BI stands on its own and is a very effective tool, and therefore there are      many ways to use it. However, as stated previously it is a great place to  start and fnish most analytics projects. And as stated previously, modern    BI systems contain machine learning and other tools that we will soon    explore.    130  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     BI is big and broad   There are many careers within the horizontal business dimension – all the  IT and systems support, application developers  more technical develop- ment , business developers  report and dashboard creators , consumers   viewers  and more. Then you have the vertical use of BI. BI is present in  virtually every industry, both private and public sectors. Careers abound and  professionals have many options for upward and lateral career progression.   Figure 5.2  Diabetes management dashboard to explore factors affecting compliance.      Figure 5.3  Geospatial analytics. Circles are hot, meaning you can drill into “dark  gray” or “lighter gray” zones.       What Are BI and Visual BI?  ◾  131           BI IN ACTION – POWERFUL DASHBOARDS  FOR CARE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES   The  following  is  a  brief  example  using  visual  dashboards  to  support  operational BI:        It is important for diabetic patients to get frequent preventative  care such as foot and eye exams  and more . This falls under care    coordination. In addition, agencies like the National Committee for      Quality  Assurance   NCQA   support  performance  measures  such  as HEDIS  Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set  that    measure how well health plans are doing getting patients in to their    doctors and clinics to take care of these preventative exams. BI sys- tems  can  help  these  plans  and  care  providers  to  raise  compliance    rates. We offer three sample dashboards as examples. The follow- ing  dashboard  provides  a  broad  perspective  of  compliance  across    many variables  “dark gray” is noncompliant, “light gray” is compli- ant .  Care  coordinators  and  chronic  disease  managers  can  quickly    get an analytic perspective of factors affecting compliance of exams    and work toward improvement. This dashboard is interactive, mean- ing that when a user clicks on an element, this selection cascades    through  the  dashboard  and  the  relevant  information  is  displayed     Figure 5.2 .            Another useful example of this operational BI is the ability to use    geospatial maps and determine zones to concentrate on. In the fol-   lowing figure, the circles represent zones around Austin, Texas. You    can click on a “dark gray” portion of a circle and the medical record  numbers  MRNs  that are not in compliance are displayed  see the    bottom of the screen: MRN, BMI, care manager, primary care depart-   ment and other attributes pop up . A case manager can then contact  those  individuals  that  are  non-compliant  and  get  them  in  for  care    for they need and make them compliant, thus lowering the chance      they will need the emergency room and improving the HEDIS scores   Figure 5.3 .   Our  last  example  is  the  visual  representation  of  the  most  important  factors that drive a predictive model outcome. The model is built using  existing  data  with  a  goal  to  predict  whether  a  patient  will  present  to  the emergency room. Each dot is a patient and there are four variables  displayed for each patient. Illustrated is the identifcation of an outlier,    132  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     i.e., a patient at risk. The care manager can mark this patient in the BI  system with a note, as is done below in therectangle seen in fgure 5.4.  This notation will persist and alert the corresponding scheduling person- nel to take appropriate action and make an appointment with the correct  department  Figure 5.4 .   Now that we have offered some strengths and a BI example, let us   explore some weaknesses of BI.   1  Humans have strong imaginations and can see things in a graphic that   2  Humans can visualize only a minimal set of variables  3  Retrospective only – except in the mind of the consumer  4  Cannot visualize higher order of relationships  5  Cognition is primarily in the head, computers are more objective and   Weaknesses                      do not really exist          cheaper for many tasks       6  Less powerful and usually less valuable than data science and AI  7  Portability from one vendor to another may be challenging   Figure 5.4  Visual representation of a predictive analytics model with collaboration   notifcation.       What Are BI and Visual BI?  ◾  133           Humans have strong imaginations   People LOVE these dashboards and images; humans are great at seeing  relationships  for good or evil, real or unreal . There are many presenta- tions available like “How to Support the Budget Proposal” with Data Viz. A  major university has promoted webinars where the goal is to teach you how  to present toward a specifc goal – creating your presentation for executive  review to ensure you get next year’s budget. Moreover, then the webinar  points out ways to bias the presentation – ways to “cherry-pick” relation- ships, maximize some, minimize others in an executive presentation. While  this might be good for one’s career, it may not be good for the organization.   Humans can visualize only a minimal set of variables   A good analyst can consume and review the relationships across a few  dozen variables in creating a few dashboard graphics and illustrations. The  BI platform might be capable of supporting many more, but a professional  creating dashboards is limited by time. We will see that machine learning  can process tens of thousands of variables quickly. Again, this is where the  marriage of the two domains really makes sense.   Retrospective only – except in the mind of the consumer   Predictive analytics is about predicting the likelihood of a future event based    on conditions; it is looking toward the future or the front windshield. BI is      really about looking at the past, looking through the rearview mirror – that  is all the BI tool can provide. However, the human brain takes this “rearview    mirror” information and projects the results into the future. While useful, there    are more objective ways to handle this via machine and statistical learning.   Cannot visualize higher order of relationships   Multivariate statistics and data mining can assess dozens of variables and  their interactions  how variables are interrelated  in high dimensions. You  can create a model that consists of dozens of important predictors. If you  look at a specifc chart attempting to make an evaluation of the underlying  relationships, three or four variables is about the maximum most people are  comfortable in interpreting.    134  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Cognition is primarily in the head, computers are  more objective and cheaper for many tasks   We offered a section on this topic in Chapter 3. Many tasks are better served  by computer processing – at least at a frst pass. While exploring the data  is still important, it is often helpful to use machines and CPU since they  are normally a lower-cost option. Please see our expose in Chapter 3, “A  Note on Cognition,” where we state that cognition occurs in two places – a  machine or machines and your head. The real beneft of cognition is two- fold: increased knowledge and improved decision-making.   Less powerful and often less valuable than data science and AI   This is certainly related to the previous section and the analytics maturity. In  the previous chapter, in Figure 4.1 we illustrated the fve distinct processes  that increasingly raise the value of analytics as we go from the bottom to the  top  left to right in Figure 4.1 . BI is descriptive analytics and lower on the  chart compared with other types of analytics. So, choose your platform judi- ciously as the total cost of switching platforms can be considerably higher  than the difference in license cost.   Figure 5.5  Anscombe’s Quartet – Know Thy Data!       What Are BI and Visual BI?  ◾  135           Portability from one vendor to another may be challenging   We have heard in the feld that the way certain vendors approach the instal- lation, maintenance and creation of BI assets  reports, dashboards, etc.  var- ies greatly. This makes moving from one platform to another platform more  diffcult than one would think.   AN EXAMPLE WHERE BI TRUMPS STATISTICS   Be careful of one-off exceptions. They are often used to illustrate anom- alies  of  events;  things  that  happen  rarely,  if  at  all.  However,  we  will  provide  an  interesting  one  here.  Francis  Anscombe,  a  statistician,  syn- thetically constructed four sets of data. He then demonstrated these four  sets of data produced virtually the exact same statistics  means, correla-   tions,  variances,  etc. ,  but  far  different  graphs.  Figure  5.5  illustrates  the  differences graphically.   This supports our position that we need a combination of technologies  to use when working with data. It is not just visual techniques, it is not  just statistics, data science or AI, it is about a combination of the right  tools  in  knowledgeable  hands  that  leads  to  making  better  data-driven  decisions.   Summary   We started this chapter with an overview of where BI fts into the analytics  picture, and with a brief history of the development of BI over the past few  decades. We provided three broad categories of BI:             1  Basic Reporting  2  A View inside the Data Warehouse and Interactive BI  3  Beyond the Data Warehouse and Enhanced Interactive – Visual BI and         More   We also made it clear that today’s BI systems generally include more  advanced statistical and machine learning methods, thus making them more  valuable than the BI of many years ago.    136  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Some of the main points we hit upon in this chapter include:          1. Operational vs Project Based B  2. A basic history and reasons behind the evolution of BI  3. Strengths and Weaknesses of BI          Overall, we can say that while AI, machine learning and data science top  the career lists, BI is very important and in demand as well. For careers  listed as “the hard skills companies need most,” BI ranks 20 out of the top  25  see Petrone, 2018 .   Postscript   In this chapter we have looked at BI from its earliest development decades  ago to today’s BI, which includes both visual and machine learning addi- tions. These additions greatly enhance the accuracy  truth  and effectiveness  of using BI in decision-making.   In the next chapter, we go into many of the methods and algorithms  that actually do the data analytics to effectively understand data, namely,  machine learning and data mining methods.

Chapter 6  What Are Machine Learning  and Data Mining?   Keywords: Models, Algorithms, ML  Machine Learning , Data Mining,  Parameters, Ensemble, Regression, Classifcation, Natural Language  Processing, Clustering   Preamble   This chapter is about two very powerful areas of analytics. However, are  they really two distinct areas? We will explore that question as well as impor- tant, elementary foundations in these areas. We will provide a few examples  of the types of problems machine learning and data mining can solve. We  will explore the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques compared  with business intelligence  BI  covered in the last chapter and provide a brief  contrast to the next chapter on artifcial intelligence  AI .   Overview of Machine Learning and Data Mining   Is There a Difference?   This is an interesting question. The short answer is today, in practice, not  really. They both cover the same relevant methods and techniques. It is  the maturity and morphing of the terminology that changes over time. As  we have said and will continue to say throughout this book, these tidal   139    140  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     movements are driven primarily by marketing and pressures to appear inno- vative. As we have said in virtually every chapter, there is hype and there is  reality. There are some “net new” terminology and some “reinvented” termi- nology. For sure, there is improvement in technology, from the hardware to  a myriad of software platforms across all the subjects we discuss, and we do  not want to discount improvements in technology. We only want to help our  readers with the ever-changing terminology landscape.   A  Brief  Historical Perspective of Data  Mining and Machine Learning   In brief, AI precedes machine learning, just barely. AI research was frst  performed during a “Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artifcial  Intelligence” conference in the summer of 1956. Arthur Samuel coined the  term “machine learning” in 1959 while at IBM. The way Samuel coined the  term implied that machine learning was a subset of AI. However, there was  a major split of thought in these two felds and the AI camp separated from  the machine learning camp. There was a mini-explosion of AI application  and research in the 1980s. For example, Texas Instruments created a com- puter processing unit specifcally designed to do AI.   It should be noted that most practitioners consider AI to be a subset of     machine learning. We will see shortly that when practitioners think of algo- rithmic AI they think of neural networks, and all of its relatives – algorithms      that mimic the human brain. An important note: we just said algorithmic  AI. In the application of AI, you see things as simple as a light sensor on    a light to be considered AI. Also, we need to make a distinction between    “Weak AI” and “Strong AI.” Weak AI may be as simple as the logic in a light    sensor that turns a light on   off where a computer programmer writes the    logic. Strong AI machines have a “mind of their own,” so to speak, based on    complex algorithms that allow them to learn as they go and thus enabling    them to act differently in different situations  E-3 Magazine, May 27, 2019 .   “Data mining” research came many years later, in 1995, at the “First   International Conference on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery.” Usama  Fayyad, a co-founder of the conference, started a new journal in 1996, Data    Mining and Knowledge Discovery.   “Data Mining is the extraction of implicit, previously unknown and  potentially useful information from data”  see Witten et al., 2016 . The  authors made this comment over twenty years ago in their frst edition and it  is true twenty years later. The term is actually a misnomer since we are not  mining for data, we are mining for knowledge. Fayyad had the right idea by    What Are Machine Learning and Data Mining?  ◾  141           combing the two terms, but most practitioners referred to the area as simply  “data mining” until about ten years later, when “machine learning” came  more in vogue as the term du jour. We think the term is more descriptive  of the actual process  teaching machines to learn by feeding them data –  machine learning . And, the circle was complete. No, wait, AI started really  being popular again in 2011. We should note that these terms never went  away, just the emphasis on usage. In fact, the three major “Data Mining  Commercial” packages that had all  or almost all  of these machine learn- ing and neural network  AI  algorithms had been available as early as about  1996 and fully available in easy-to-use formats to industry, government, and  healthcare from the year 2000; yet some of these organizations were slow to  embrace the new technology. But, you are asking yourself, why did AI come  back with popularity in 2011? IBM Watson defeated two Jeopardy champions.   PRODUCTS HYPED IN HEALTHCARE TOO  EARLY LEAD TO MISSED EXPECTATIONS   IBM  Watson  offered  “too  much,”  however,  to  some  areas,  particularly  healthcare. IBM Watson was very expensive to install and implement in  an organization. Places like MD Anderson Medical Center did purchase  it but after a period of time discovered that it could not do what it was  touted to do and discontinued its use in 2017 after 5 years and a US$62  million cost  loss   Schmidt, 2017 .   Obviously, the AI abilities were not up to what they had been hyped  to be at that time. However, the abilities of AI to change our world are  rapidly increasing in scope and capacity  Miner et al., 2019 .   There is another reason for the rise in AI research and usage in the last   10 years – computing power. If you look at the history of AI, there was  conception in the 1950s, a big spike in the 1980s when computers became  more powerful and now in the last ten years we have tremendous comput- ing power and tons of data! More on AI in our next chapter.      DATA MINING VS DATA DREDGING  DATA   FISHING OR DATA SNOOPING    Years ago, there was resistance by certain camps, especially statisticians,  against data mining. The misunderstanding arose from the objective of    142  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     the process. It is true that if you look at a large dataset you can fnd rela- tionships that are statistically signifcant, but are purely by chance  see  an example of “Causation vs Correlation” in Chapter 4 . Some researchers  were misusing the process; they were data dredging by looking at hun- dreds  of  relationships,  fnding  one  that  was  statistically  signifcant  and  reporting the results with the associated statistics – claiming that they had  found some new insight.      Your 2nd author  Gary Miner  was attending the JSM  Joint Statistical  Meetings  annual meeting in Canada in the year 2000, and attended the  President’s Banquet and talk one evening during that week. The President  got up to give his talk and started by saying:   You statisticians are going to have to do an “about face” – in this new  century we are in a new age of “Modern Data Analysis – Predictive  Analytics – Data Mining” and unless those of you who earn a living  as “consulting statisticians” make changes you will soon lose your  clients!!!   That made me take notice, as I had already committed myself to put- ting my efforts into data mining and text mining. I was at the meeting as    an exhibitor for the company I worked with; our company gave a PRIZE      AWARD to the “Consulting Statisticians” sub-group, which would have their  annual “dinner meeting” on Tuesday evening of that week. Several years    later, about 2005 or so, at the annual JSM meeting, Gary stopped in at the      Consulting Statisticians dinner meeting, late, just as they had put up a slide  showing that their clients had dropped at a 45-degree angle downward    since the year 2000!!! Obviously, they had NOT gotten the message of the      President in 2000; they were still trying to sell their efforts as “traditional    statistics” when the market now wanted modern predictive data analytics.  That is why it is important to have a well-rounded set of methods and    techniques to employ based on the various problems one might be facing.   Note: When doing research to demonstrate causality, one should not sim-  ply build a predictive model and state the model as prescriptive or causal.  If you want to prove that the model is causal, special care must be taken.  An example of a prescriptive model that is not prescriptive can be found  in Chapter 8 in a gray box – “The Most Misunderstood Concept in Data  Science Today.”    What Are Machine Learning and Data Mining?  ◾  143           After 50 years of combined practice, we think most practitioners today  see data mining and machine learning as essentially the same studies and  AI as being a special subset of them. “Machine learning” is the more popu- lar term today in our experience, and this is supported by a simple Internet  search, with “machine learning” returning about four times as many results  as “data mining.” At the time of this writing, “artifcial intelligence” has a  slight lead over “machine learning,” by about 12%, in Internet searches.   What Types of Analytics Are Covered  by Machine Learning?   We mentioned 50 types of analytics in Chapter 4 and noted you will fnd  many more if you search very hard. Machine learning applies to most of  these in one way or another with a few exceptions such as descriptive  analytics and visual analytics. The analytics classifcations that do not inher- ently use machine learning  like traditional linear regression analysis and  discriminant analysis  often merge into analytics that do by modifying their  processes with “machine learning methods.”   A NOTE OF CAUTION   As Dr. Daniel Larose  an old professor of Scott’s, Larose, 2005  says “data  mining is easy to do badly.” For example, researchers may apply inap- propriate analysis to datasets that call for a completely different approach,  or a model may be developed built on wholly specious assumptions. Do  you know what your software is really doing? Do you know the type of  algorithm that it is applying? Documentation is typically better for com- mercial solutions, but it is still lacking in most cases. It is up to the user  to be aware of what is happening in the background. Caveat emptor, as  they say: buyer beware! Better said, you can’t beat knowledge and being  careful – we hope you are enjoying the book!   While we agree fundamentally with Dr. Larose, we believe there is less of   a chance of misapplication of machine learning methods than many statisti- cal methods. For example, in tests of signifcance and making inferences,  researchers will test a number of hypotheses and never correct for multiple    144  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     inferences – we will explore more of this in Chapter 10  also see Nisbet,  Miner, and Yale, 2018 .   An Overview of Problem Types and Common Ground   We now cover a few of the general classes of problems that data mining and  machine learning can effectively handle. We do this to help reduce the com- plexity of the thousands of problems that can be solved with these methods.  There are some general problem types; below we discuss the classifcation  of the most common types in data analytics.   The BIG Three!   We begin with the BIG three problem types that machine learning can  help address:   ◾  Regression    ◾  Classifcation    ◾  Natural Language Processing     The frst two are what we call “supervised learning” methods, meaning we  identify to the algorithm what we are trying to predict, call it a target, and  provide some additional variables to help the algorithm learn a way to dis- tinguish the target properties. They are “supervised” as we are specifying a  prediction problem for the computer algorithm.   Let us make two quick distinctions. We will be speaking of numeric vari-  ables. Those are variables measured on either discrete counts or they may  be fully continuous. Examples of continuous variables are the number of  x-rays per year, per member per month  PMPM  insurance cost or the gross  domestic product  GDP . The second type of variable is called a categori- cal variable, which are non-numeric variables that possess a distinct quality.  Examples are gender, state or country of residence or medical procedure  codes.   Regression   In regression problems, we are trying to predict a numeric outcome. For this  chapter, we will call this outcome a “target” variable  you may also see these  called dependent, outcome or response variables . We may use any mixture  of numeric categorical variables to predict this outcome. These variables    What Are Machine Learning and Data Mining?  ◾  145           used to help us predict we will call “predictors” for this chapter  you may  also see these called independent variables, input variables or factors .   An example of regression would be predicting the length of a hospital  stay  LOS = length of stay  using clinical and other factors. The target vari- able is numeric, the LOS is in days  numeric  and the inputs could be both  numeric and categorical. For example, diagnosis-related group  DRG , time  in surgery, wound classifcation, age of the patient, gender, discharge desti- nation and many, many more including non-clinical variables like socioeco- nomic condition, geography and more.   Another example in government is the use of regression analysis to   determine policy decisions, for example in a state or county correctional  system where understanding the “average daily jail population,” the number  of arrests and types of crimes are of interest. This allows for having the right  amount of support, police offcers and jail cells available under varying envi- ronmental   societal conditions  Guynes and McEwen, 1998 .   Classifcation   In classifcation problems, we are trying to predict a categorical outcome.  And again, for this chapter, we will call this outcome a target variable  you  will also see this called a dependent, outcome or response variable . We  may use any mixture of numeric categorical variables to predict this out- come. These variables are used to help us predict what we will call predic- tors for this chapter  you will also see these called independent variables,  input variables or factors .   An example of classifcation is facial recognition. Suppose we are try-  ing to determine via airport cameras whether any of the patrons walking  inside a terminal is on a suspected terrorist list. The target variable is “on  list” or “not on list.” The predictor variables are all derived from data being  streamed via cameras. This recording data is broken into thousands of  inputs and used in a classifcation model to determine the outcome.   Another example of classifcation is credit scoring to determine who is a   “good credit risk” or a “bad credit risk,” hence a categorical outcome  target .   Natural Language Processing  NLP    We will not get in too deeply here. However, it is a very important and  very wide area. In short,  for most analyses  we preprocess the text and  speech, converting it into data that looks more like numbers and categories.  A simple example would be, in a corpus  a body of text , whether the word    146  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     “friend” or some term with a similar meaning appears in the corpus. Of  course, it can get very complicated, but we will keep it simple for now.   One powerful example of NLP is determining the presence or absence of   disease using clinical notes. This is performed via text mining, a subset of  NLP. These clinical notes are free-form text collected within a database, so  instead of sending a list of structured variables we are providing notes. The  algorithms go against the clinical notes and some reference data and diction- aries and determine the probability that this patient has the disease.   A very good example of how text mining can use clinical notes to pro-  vide a much more accurate prediction is the schizophrenic twin studies that  are reported as tutorials No. I and No. U in the 2012 book Practical Text  Mining  Miner et al., 2012 . These two case studies  presented as complete  “tutorials” showing all the steps in the data analytics  are entitled:  1  Text  Mining Speech Samples: Can the Speech of Individuals Diagnosed with  Schizophrenia Differentiate Them from Unaffected Controls?  Thompson  et al., 2012a; on page 395 ; and  2  Exploring the Unabomber Manifesto  Using Text Mining  Thompson et al 2012b on page 681 . In these text min- ing analyses, a neural network  an AI-type algorithm  was able to model  the data best in an initial competitive evaluation of different ML algorithms,  so neural networks were used to comprehensively examine the data using  Train, Test and Validation samples. An amazingly high accuracy score was  obtained, greater than 90% accurate in predicting schizophrenia from the  speech patterns of schizophrenics, whereas previous traditional statistical  psychological studies had been only able to get predictions in the 40–50%  range. Of even greater interest, when the model derived from theses schizo- phrenic speech studies was applied to the long written manifesto of the  Unabomber  a person who had a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University  of Michigan, and then disappeared but was eventually found in the Montana  mountains years ago, the late 1990s, after he’d sent the manifesto to the New    York Times in 1995 and mailed bomb packages to selected professors around  the United States , it predicted that the Unabomber most likely suffered from  schizophrenia.   Some  of Many  Additional Problem Classes   There are many other problem types, but we wanted to mention a couple  more general classes and we want to distinguish these from the above  supervised methods. These are unsupervised methods, meaning we do not    What Are Machine Learning and Data Mining?  ◾  147           specify a target variable. We normally throw in a whole group of variables  and see how they interact together.   Association, Rules and Recommender Systems      Association rules are of the form IF “A” THEN “B.” These can grow into  very large sets of rules, because instead of a single “A” there can be an  entire list. Take for example a grocery store. How should you lay out the  store? What items naturally sell together? Alternatively, if you are an Internet  retailer, and someone buys a smart health tracking device, what should you  show him or her on the web page next – running shorts? These are called  “recommender systems” and provide a way to help “lift” sales volumes and  revenue. It should be noted that association rules are only one way to get a  recommendation. There are many others, some quite complex as you can  imagine, as there are billions of dollars at stake  see Linoff, Gordon, and  Berry, 2011 .   THE BEER AND DIAPER PROBLEM   A classical association rule example is called the “beer and diaper” prob- lem. It is quoted in different ways, but it originated in the 1990s in the  early  days  of  this  type  of  analysis.  A  researcher  found  that  beer  and  diapers  were  bought  within  the  same  shopping  cart  very  often;  much  higher  than  other  shopping  items.  The  story  goes  that  the  researcher  thought  the  result  was  anomalous  and  described  the  issue  to  a  fellow  coworker who had just recently become a new father. The coworker told  the researcher that he did not fnd the result odd at all. He responded,  “a spouse is called, ‘Honey, would you pick up some diapers on the way  home?’ The dutiful spouse complies and while they are at the store they  walk by the beer cooler and say to themselves, ‘sounds good’ and adds it  the cart.” The problem is, what do you actually do with this information?  Is it actionable? If so, how? It is an interesting story nevertheless.   For population health, epidemiologists and informaticists may investigate   large data sets across diverse geographic and demographic populations to  determine what the associations are across different factors as a starting  point to understand the relationships for further investigation.    148  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Clustering   Clustering is a very useful method, especially in the exploratory phases of  data analytics, including descriptive analytics. It often progresses into predic- tive analytics. It is a non-supervised approach. In contrast to regression or  classifcation, where we specify a target, there is no target variable speci- fed. All variables of interest are thrown into the mix and then we see what  variables’ values tend to cluster together across variables.   A great use of cluster analysis is understanding customer behaviors.   Suppose I am selling many products in many geographic areas to many dif- ferent customers and I have considerable data on these customers including  sociodemographic data. I can judicially add several variables into a cluster- ing algorithm with the intent of understanding customer clusters. I can use  those clusters to generate some specifc customer profles. Now that I have  profles, I have a target variable! I can next use predictive analytics to better  serve my customers. For example, I can use the profle as a target to cre- ate marketing campaigns, targeted advertisements, and customer retention  programs.   Another example is the public sector area. Tax assessing and collection   agencies at the state and local levels need to understand all segments of  their taxing base. They can use clustering to better identify small clusters   microsegments  of their population. Adding this to geospatial analytics adds  real value.   These two examples have illustrated how multiple classes categories of   analytics can work together.   Some Comments on Model Types   There are many considerations when using different methods or algorithms  to generate models. As we have seen above, many analytic problems are not  just a one-step process. Instead, we start with a general problem, fnd an  analytics solution and then incorporate that solution as an input into another  analytic solution and so on. Kind of cool – like Lego blocks!   There are more aspects to consider than we can cover in this book, and  it certainly is very industry and application specifc, but we do want to men- tion three areas:          1  Some Popular Machine Learning Algorithm Classes  2  Transparency and Processing Time of Algorithms  3  Model Use and Deployment           What Are Machine Learning and Data Mining?  ◾  149           WHAT IS FUN? WHERE DO MOST PEOPLE   ACTUALLY SPEND THEIR TIME?   Michael O’Connell  Chief Analytics Offcer at TIBCO  said: “data scien- tists  machine learning practitioners  spend about 80% of their time doing  data prep and the other 20% of the time complaining about the time they  are spending in data prep.” This is actually derived from an established  fact that analytics is about 80% consumed by data prep and about 20% in  machine learning, modeling, and other activities.   Most people, the authors included, enjoy applying these machine learn- ing algorithms, discovering new insights and wrapping these insights up  in visual dashboards and non-data-related activities more than the data  preparation. Software companies are automating machine learning pro- cesses. However, most of the automation thus far, is happening on the  modeling side – not the data sourcing, data merging, data understanding,  and  cleansing  activities.  There  have  been  inroads  and  these  develop- ments will improve – see AutoML in a later section in this chapter.   Some Popular Machine Learning Algorithm Classes                            1  Trees 1.0: Classifcation and Regression Trees  CART  or Partition Trees  2  Trees 2.0: Advanced Trees – Interactive Trees  CART and CHAID ,   3  Regression Model Trees and Cubist Models  4  Logistic and Constrained  penalized, LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net        Boosted Trees and Random Forests, for Classifcation and Regression      Regression                 5  Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines  MARS   6  Support Vector Machines  SVMs   7  Neural Networks in 1000 Flavors  8  K-Means Clustering Algorithm  9  Directed Acyclic Graph Analytics  Optimization, Social Networks   10  Association Rules  11  AutoML   We will now provide some brief comments for these classes. This is meant  to provide only the highest conceptual level and to provide some references  for further study. We attempt to simplify these summaries as much as pos- sible. There are great resources available and we mention several references    150  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     in the following discussion as well as in the “Resources for the Avid Learner”  section. However, we want to provide three defnitions before we make  comments on the above classes of machine learning techniques.   Parameters – Parameters are constants in a model or statistical distribu- tion. For example, let’s look at elementary math, where you have the slope   m  of a line. In the conventional form of elementary math, the slope and  intercepts are both parameters. Thus in y = mx + b, the slope m and the  intercept b are parameters, the equation is the model, and x is the indepen- dent variable or predictor variable while y is the target in the machine learn- ing or statistical sense.      Ensemble Modeling – This is combining multiple models together. This   can be done inside a machine learning algorithm  meta-algorithms, e.g.,  Random Forest, see below  or by a data scientist’s action to enhance model  performance  see Nisbet et al., 2018 .   Scoring – Scoring is the process of taking characteristics from a candi-  date, inputting them into a predictive model and then letting that model pro- duce a prediction. In our previous section “Regression,” we would take the  characteristics of a new patient and input their characteristics into a model  and the model would predict  score  their LOS.   Trees 1.0: Classifcation and Regression Trees or Partition Trees     As we have noted, classifcation predicts a label  a discrete class  and    regression predicts a quantity  a continuous quantity . The target variable    values  categorical or continuous  are predicted from a group  usually     of both continuous and categorical predictor variables. The results are    displayed in a tree-like graph where the data is split into “leaves,” so to    speak, of the tree. These procedures are usually provided as one package  in software that can do either Classifcation or Regression Trees, and gen- erally referred to as CART. Overall, the purpose of the tree-building algo- rithms is to determine a set of if-then  split  conditions that permit accurate    prediction or classifcation of cases. These tree methods give simple, easy-   to-understand results, and no assumptions for the analysis are needed,    i.e. tree methods require minimal assumptions  nonparametric  and are    nonlinear. Tree methods can often provide insight into simple relationships    among a few variables that may go undetected by other analytic methods.    CHAID  Chi-Square Automatic Interactive Detector  trees are very similar  to CART but CHAID produces bushier trees by potentially creating addi- tional splits.    What Are Machine Learning and Data Mining?  ◾  151           Trees 2.0: Advanced Trees: Boosted Trees and Random  Forests, for Classifcation and Regression   Boosted trees and random forests were developed to improve the pre- dictive accuracy and overcome some of the problems of techniques we  described in our “version 1.0” of tree methods. Both are ensemble methods,  meaning they combine smaller trees together to get a better model. You may  read that these trees support stronger learners by combining many weak  learners together. The primary difference between boosted trees and ran- dom forests is that random forests work by “bagging” to reduce the variance.  Boosted trees work by, well, boosting  resampling  methods to reduce bias.    Bagging and boosting get a number of weak learners, “N,” to combine or   ensemble by generating additional data in the training stage. “N” new train-   ing data sets are produced by random sampling with replacement from the    original set. In the case of bagging, any element has the same probability to    appear in a new data set. However, for boosting the observations are weighted  and therefore some of them will take part in the new sets more often.   Regression Model Trees and Cubist Models   Two more tree-based methods we should mention are Regression Model  Trees and Cubist Trees. In CART, a new observation fnds its leaf, that is,  the location in the tree it should fall into, based on basic “if-then” rules as  described above. The prediction for a new candidate is simply the average  of the observations used to train the model. So you have a number of can- didates that end up with the same exact prediction  score  and this makes  predictions appear coarse or grainy. Why not build a linear model inside  each leaf? That is what a Regression Model Tree does. For a new score,  it does two things. It frst fnds which leaf the new candidate should fall  in; second, it fts a small linear model to this exact candidate and provides  a score based on its unique characteristics. The results are more exact and  appear fner than a CART model.   Cubist models initially create a full tree structure and collapse each path   through the tree into a rule. There are intermediate linear models built at  each step of the tree. A regression model is ft for each rule based on the  data subset defned by the rules. These models are based on the predictors  used in the previous splits. They are similar to Regression Model Trees, but  instead of using the regression equation in one leaf, the prediction is mixed  across leaves in the path.    152  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Logistic and Constrained Penalized  LASSO,  Ridge, Elastic Net  Regression   Not only books but entire libraries can be flled on the subject of regression,  and to add confusion to the mix, even the defnition of regression in the frst  place. As we have said – regression problems typically denote trying to pre- dict a numeric  quantitative  target or outcome. However, regression methods  have been ADAPTED to predict qualitative targets  categories, which we  would normally call classifcation problems . There are all kinds of regres- sion from simple to complex. On the simplest end of the spectrum, you will  see the ordinary least squares regression  OLS , which predicts a numeric  target. Then on the other end of the spectrum, you will see constrained,  penalized regression techniques that can predict numeric targets or that can  be adapted for a qualitative target.   Ordinary least squares regression and multiple regression are     closed-form solutions, meaning you do not need a looping or recursive algo- rithm to approximate a result. You simply solve with formulas. These formu-   las are derived by mathematical statistics via calculus to optimize the solution.  Ordinary means one predictor and one result; multiple regression incorpo- rates many predictors to come up with its predictions  see Kutner et al., 2004 .  Logistic regression is a technique borrowed by machine learning from   the feld of statistics. It is a method-of-choice for binary classifcation prob- lems  problems with two class values, such as disease no disease, yes no,  true false   see Brownlee, 2016–2019 .   LASSO  Least Absolute Shrinkage & Selection Operator  regression is   taught in both statistics and machine learning courses. As the name implies,  LASSO employs the concept of shrinkage. Shrinkage restricts the regression  coeffcients by applying a penalty function against them growing larger. In  fact, LASSO may shrink the less important feature coeffcients to zero, thus  removing some features altogether. The LASSO procedure encourages sim- ple, sparse models  i.e., models with fewer parameters . This particular type  of regression is well suited for models showing high levels of redundancy  in the predictors  multicollinearity  or when you want to automate certain  parts of model selection, like variable selection parameter elimination. It is a  regression method that does variable selection to enhance prediction accu- racy and interoperability of regression models, which is the reason it was  introduced  Tibshirani, 1996 .   Ridge regression is also a form of penalized regression that employs   shrinkage of the regression coeffcients. The technique ensures that variables    What Are Machine Learning and Data Mining?  ◾  153           with minor contribution have coeffcients close to zero, but does not elimi- nate them entirely. It helps solve problems with variables that are measured  with different scales  one variable in years, another in millions of dollars    see Kuhn and Johnson, 2018; Ridge Regression, 2019 .   Elastic Net is a form of penalized regression that combines features of   LASSO and ridge regression  see Kuhn and Johnson, 2018 .   Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines   Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines  MARS  is a method that  requires minimal assumptions to be made by the modeler. It builds multiple  regression models across a range of predictor variables, thus ftting a “curve”  exactly. We might say that it “learns the curve.” It has similarities to tree- based machine learning models. MARS makes no assumptions about the  relationship between the target variable and the predictor variables. MARS  is useful for relationships that change radically from linear and nonlinear  across time of some other variable. It is very fexible and fairly transparent   Hastie et al., 2009 .   Support Vector Machines  SVMs    SVMs are used in regression and classifcation tasks by constructing nonlin- ear boundaries that serve as a decision point to place a new value into one  of the other classes. They have a high degree of fexibility in handling these  tasks. There are several types of SVM models that can be applied. SVMs are  very useful in text categorization and classifcation of images. SVMs are now  widely used in the biological sciences with protein molecules  see Alpaydin,  2004 .   Neural Networks in 1000 Flavors   Neural Networks  NNs  are classifcation and clustering methods mod- eled after a hypothesized process of learning in the human brain. It is    capable of predicting new observations after learning from data. One of    the advantages is that NNs are able to learn and approximate any continu- ous function, and thus one does not need a hypothesis about one’s data    to begin with; however, setting up the initial conditions of the network is    critical. NNs are extremely powerful but very opaque, meaning you can- not understand how a NN is actually determining its result. They are “black      154  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     box” models. However, for image and video processing, they offer great    solutions that provide some of the best results of any machine learning    method; additionally, transparency is normally not an issue for these prob- lems  see Larose, 2015 .   Deep-learning networks are an extension of NNs but instead of hav-   ing the usual single hidden layer of NN, they are characterized by depth,  e.g. having many hidden layers. More than three layers  including input and    output layers  qualifes as “Deep Learning”  Nicholson, 2019; Nisbet et al.,    2018 .   K-Means and Other Clustering Algorithms   We have mentioned clustering in this chapter several times, and there are  many algorithms for clustering. Probably the most common algorithm for  clustering due to its simplicity is K-means clustering. It is a very simple  algorithm but very powerful and useful for unsupervised machine learning.  Clustering is grouping data samples together into “clusters” of “like-minded  samples.” K is the number of clusters we want in our output, so K is selected  by the modeler. The algorithm takes the data points as “input” and groups  them into “K-clusters” as output. When we have a lot of data but no specifc  hypothesis nor specifc “target variable,” this type of clustering can be very  useful in understanding the data, and may even bring about completely new  insights or discoveries.   Directed Acyclic Graph Analytics  Optimization, Social Networks    According to Gartner  Gartner Press Release, February 2019 , “graph ana- lytics is a set of analytic techniques that allows for the exploration of  relationships between entities of interest such as organizations, people  and transactions. The application of graph processing and graph DBMSs   Database Management Systems  will grow at 100% annually through 2022  to continuously accelerate data preparation and enable more complex and  adaptive data science. Graph data stores can effciently model, explore and  query data with complex interrelationships across data silos, but the need for  specialized skills has limited their adoption to date.”   Optimization. GPS is an example of an easily understood application  of machine learning algorithms applied to directed acyclic graphs  DAGs .  A good example is the practical application of Dijkstra’s algorithm, an    What Are Machine Learning and Data Mining?  ◾  155           algorithm for fnding the shortest paths in GPS applications. Other optimiza- tion constraints such as construction and traffc can be layered upon com- peting candidate routes to arrive at the best solutions.   Networks of all types can be represented as a DAG. Social networks,  where users are interfacing, can provide insight into fraud, terrorism or  groups  clusters  of “like-minded people.” Many of the algorithms cov- ered have some application to DAGs – it is the structure of the graphs that  provides valuable information to the modeling process. Bayesian statistics   networks  are often represented in DAGs, and we discuss this subject in  Chapter 10. There are also networks for biological systems, computer sys- tems and more. Any interrelated set of processes can typically be repre- sented with a DAG.   Association Rules   We mentioned association rules earlier. The goal of association rules is to  detect relationships and associations between categorical variables. Amazon  and Netfix, among others, are champions in using association rule and  recommendation engines  we mention the Netfix prize in Chapter 8 in the  gray box “Netfix Prize, Kaggle and Crowd Sourcing” . However, there are a  number of problems in healthcare and government that can be solved with  association rules.   Algorithms that support these rules are used both in regular structured   datasets and in text mining. A set of solutions around the “a priori algo- rithm” is available in open source and commercial versions. For big data, the  Frequent Pattern  FP  growth can be enabled in-memory via Spark. More  about Spark in Chapter 9.   AutoML  Automated Machine Learning    AutoML is a fairly new development where the entire process of data  analysis, from cleaning the data to competitively examining several ML  algorithms to see which will handle a specifc data set best, to selecting that  best method and fully exploring it and developing a model and a prediction,  are all done at once. This area of machine learning has and will continue to  grow very rapidly as enterprises attempt to quickly scale up their machine  learning services. See “Automated Machine Learning” in the “Resources for  the Avid Learner” section at the end of this chapter.    156  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Transparency and Processing Time of Algorithms   Now that we have several categories or classes of algorithms, which should  I choose? Should it be a powerful neural network of some type or should it  be a simple CART model? There are several considerations, but two of the  most important are speed and transparency. In other words, how long will it  take my model to train and can I explain to someone else how the model is  coming up with its predictions?   Some algorithms run very fast in comparison to others. Of course, all   of this is dependent on the number of variables, along with the number of  features and rows of data. CART and linear regression are the quickest meth- ods. NNs are the longest-running methods and everything else is in between   as a very rough rule of thumb .   Some algorithms return models that are very transparent and you can  easily explain how the model is working. Again, CART and linear regres- sion models are very transparent: they generate rules and functions that you  present to managers and leadership that explain how the model is making  predictions. Neural networks are very opaque or non-transparent. Following  and explaining even one prediction from a very simple neural network will  make eyes glaze over in a presentation. Many government and regulatory  bodies, like the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  and the Food  and Drug Administration  FDA , require model transparency!   Model Use and Deployment   This is a very large area and we will cover it in depth in our next book, which    we noted previously. But, we should mention that it is important to consider      at the onset how a researcher or enterprise will want to use the model once  it is created. It could be small or enterprise-wide. Some models are deployed    into production IT processes, some are hard coded into products, some are    provided as services via a web interface  e.g. RESTful  Representational State    Transfer  API  and some are used on an ad hoc basis as needed.   Major Components of the Machine Learning Process   In Chapter 3, we covered a process that is well accepted and yet adapt- able to machine learning projects. It was called CRISP-DM  Cross-Industry    What Are Machine Learning and Data Mining?  ◾  157           Standard Process for Data Mining  and includes a nice set of procedures. In  Chapter 4 we talked about the data cycle, which is also useful. In general,  here are the major steps involved in a project  which can vary as needed :   1  Data Sourcing  2  Data Merging  3  Exploratory Data Analysis  4  Data Cleansing  5  Analysis  6  Modeling or Reporting  7  Deployment                  Advantages and Limitations of Using Machine Learning   Unlike in the last chapter, where you can effectively look at a handful of  variables at a time, machine learning allows you to work with literally thou- sands of variables. The curse of dimensionality may still exist for some algo- rithms to scale, but we have ways to minimize this problem.   Contrasted to BI of the last chapter, machine learning offers advantages:   2  The size of the problem is limited only by computer resources –     1  It lets the computer do the processing cognition: please see Chapter 3      “A Note on Cognition”  where cognition happens.    machine learning covers very large problems.    algorithm is interpreting the data rather than an analyst looking at and  interpreting aggregations and statistics of visual dashboards.     3  Its results are mathematically verifed, meaning that an established   4  It offers more powerful insights and value-added results.   And, some disadvantages:      1  It requires more education or training. A producer or analyst using     Visual BI can produce output after just a few days of training. While  companies are trying to make machine learning ever simpler, it stills  requires a much deeper understanding to execute machine learning  properly.    Where Do Most People Actually Spend Their Time?” in this chapter   2  It requires more data pre-processing. See gray box, “What Is Fun?                                     158  ◾        It’s All Analytics!          3  The total cost will be higher. This is due to either training or software.  Open source is “free,” but you have to hire someone with more skills   especially coding  to operate it. Computer  hardware and software   will have higher requirements.   Please note again, visual analytics  and BI  and machine learning are not  mutually exclusive! They are complementary. BI is very useful in the begin- ning to discover initial insights and at the end of the process to present the  results of machine learning! Moreover, for departments or organizations with  a smaller budget, BI can add value on its own.   Postscript   In this chapter, we compared the differences in history and application of  data mining and machine learning. We looked at some various forms of dif- ferent algorithms that employ these methods. We classifed or grouped them  into logical units. However, you should know there are many more available.  Knowledge and application comprise the key to deriving value from these  data-driven techniques. Some of these algorithms are in the “AI realm.” In  the next chapter, we will go into AI in detail.

Chapter 7  AI  Artifcial Intelligence     and How It Differs from  Machine Learning   Keywords: AI  Artifcial Intelligence , Artifcial Neural Networks, Deep  Learning, Image Recognition, Hadoop, Spark, In-memory Computing, Weak  AI, Strong AI, LISP, Expert Systems   Preamble   In the last chapter, we looked at data mining and machine learning. We  discovered the history, some nuances, and applications – and in the end, It’s    All Analytics! From constrained regression to support vector machines to  artifcial intelligence  AI , we looked at it all. We now cover an exciting area  of analytics that has been exploding in practice and use over the last several  years. Its application, benefts, and drawbacks are often misunderstood, and  our goal here is to clear up those misunderstandings of artifcial intelligence  or as is now common in everyday vernacular – AI.   Introduction   Let us start with an overview of where AI fts into the analytics picture.  First, AI is all the rage these days! From a consumer standpoint, you  can get AI in almost everything. From coffee makers to virtual intelligent   161    162  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     personal assistants  VPAs , from the simple to the very complex. We talk  about this in the weak AI section. In fact, a very successful entrepreneur said  they had 1,000 new startup ideas! What were they? Just add AI to existing  products and services!   Then there is a second AI: strong AI. This is the formation of AI models  using algorithms. This is where data scientists play. They can build analytic  workfows that contain thousands of features  variables, but a term that is  more common in the AI space is features .   Let Us Outline Two Types of AI Here – Weak AI and Strong AI   Weak AI  narrow AI  is what many people think of when they hear AI,  because it is embedded into products and services that they commonly use.  We just mentioned VPAs. Siri, Alexa, and Cortana are three examples of  VPAs. Weak AI is a collection of technologies that rely on algorithms and  programmatic responses to simulate intelligence. VPAs sound very smart, but  the program they execute simply listens for key sounds in your speech and  when it detects them, follows its programming to execute certain actions   like cross-referencing a database for responses to certain queries questions .   Strong AI  true AI  is what futurists think of when they hear the term  AI. Strong AI is intended to think independently. These systems are built to  mimic the human brain and they are designed to be cognitive. They do not  merely execute scripts, but are built to be aware of context and nuance and  to make decisions that refect actual thought. Strong AI is adaptable, mean- ing that it will learn and make better decisions over time. Terminator is an  example of strong AI, but there are many other examples as well, including  ones that do much simpler things!   The data scientist is interested in building models using AI algorithms.   The application of these models could be either weak or strong AI. For sim- plicity, we will use the concept of weak AI and that the goal for modeling  will be to embed our model in a product or service, or to execute at will  ad  hoc . This is our perspective for this chapter. We are primarily focusing on  the application of algorithmic AI to build models and produce code that can  be embedded in analytic processes as well as products. We are focused on  the development of AI from a machine learning perspective.   In brief, AI is popular and there is a lot of confusion and hype about   what it actually does. Our goal in the chapter is to help clear up some of  the confusion.   Another way to look at AI – it is both the intelligence of machines and   the branch of data science or computer science used to create it. We will be    AI and How It Differs from Machine Learning  ◾  163           focusing on the latter in this chapter. And, we will cover four major evolu- tions  as we see it  in AI over the last 50-plus years and a glimpse into the  future.   There are other ways of “slicing and dicing”  or understanding  AI, and as   an example please see the next gray box on “Four Types of AI”:   FOUR TYPES OF AI   There are four types of AI:   ◾  Reactive Machines    ◾  Limited Memory    ◾  Theory of Mind    ◾  Self-Awareness     Reactive Machines: IBM’s Deep Blue chess-playing supercomputer  is an example of this. It beat the international master chess player, Garry  Kasparov, in the late 1990s. Deep Blue  now called IBM Watson, as IBM  has  developed  it  for  medicine  and  other  industrial  uses   can  identify  pieces on a chessboard, know how each piece moves and make predic- tions about what moves may be made next and thus, by rules of logic,    “decides” which move is most advantageous. BUT, doesn’t have any con- cept of the past, nor any memory of what has happened before.         Limited  Memory:  These  types  of  AI  machines  can  look  into  the    past. An example is self-driving cars that do some of this now by observ- ing other cars’ speed, position, and direction. The AI machine has to    observe the other cars over time, in order to calculate speed, etc. The AI    machine has to have things like lane marking, understanding of curves,    etc.  programmed  into  its  memory,  and  programmed  to  interact  with    what it is “seeing” at the moment. These limited  simple  pieces of infor- mation are not saved into the car’s library of experience  like human    drivers do “automatically”  but instead are only temporary  transient .    So the self-driving car does not have the ability to learn how to handle    new  situations  because  it  cannot “remember”  what  it  experiences   as    humans do .         Theory of Mind: This is where we have “hit a wall” in AI develop- ment. “Theory of mind” means that the AI machine needs to be able to  form an understanding about things in the world – the understanding of  “motives” and “intentions” of other entities  the cars and the humans in  the cars, in addition to other creatures and objects in the world . If AI    164  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     “creatures” are to work and interact with us humans, they will have to  “understand” human emotions and feelings and be able to adjust their  “robotic behavior” to adjust if they are to be fully successful.   Self-Awareness:  Fully  successful  AI  machines  will  have  to  have  a  “consciousness;”  this  means  that  the  AI  researchers  will  also  have  to  fully understand consciousness in order to be able to build this into their  AI machines. Consciousness is “self-awareness.” Humans waiting in traf- fc may experience someone behind them honking their car’s horn; the  human  understands  that  the  person  in  the  car  is  probably  “angry”  or  experiencing some other emotion like “impatience” because they have  an emergency and have to get to a hospital, for example. Humans under- stand that other humans probably have those same or similar feelings.  Therefore, AI scientists building “consciousness” or “self-awareness” into  their machines will be essential, if we are to ever get to a fully function- ing robot.   From: Hintze, Arend, Michigan State University, 2016.   AI Background and Chronology   One of the premises of this book is to clear up the confusion, in both sub- stance and terminology, in the analytics, data science, and AI domain. We  feel it is always useful to consider historical perspectives so we can under- stand the advent and evolution of the terminology and study the practices  and use of these technologies. We covered a rich history of machine learn- ing and data mining in the last chapter. We review the history of AI now.  Some of these overlap, but as we have said we want each chapter to be  free-standing and available for reference.   We view AI history in fve major stages, and believe AI is poised for a   bright future. So frst, let us explore these fve stages:              1  Short History of Digital AI  2  Resurrection in the 80s  3  Beyond the Second Winter  4  Deep Learning, Bigger and New Data  5  Next-Generation AI                  AI and How It Differs from Machine Learning  ◾  165           Short History of Digital AI   The philosophy of AI and AI as a concept have been around for centuries.  We cover the major digital perspectives.   As we said in the last chapter, AI precedes machine learning, just  barely. AI research was frst performed during a “Dartmouth Summer  Research Project on Artifcial Intelligence” conference in the summer of  1956  University of Washington, 2006; Lewis, 2014; Anyoha, 2017 . Arthur  Samuel coined the term “machine learning” in 1959 while at IBM  see  Machine Learning Defnition; Samuel, 1959 . The way Samuel coined the  term implied that machine learning was a subset of AI. However, there  was a major split of thought in these two felds and the AI camp separated  from the machine learning camp. While AI may be an overarching term  that encompasses machine learning, that is not often the way practitioners  view it. It is often useful to think specifcally. If you use the term “AI,” most  practitioners will think of automated neural networks and deep learning or  one of the many derivatives or applications of these two domains. When  you say “machine learning,” a data scientist will think more broadly to the  techniques we covered in the last chapter. So, there is a distinction between  history and practice.      Why the 1950s? Because it was the birth of the digital age and computers   were becoming  barely  powerful enough to start bringing new technolo- gies to bear. Spoiler alert – every major reinvention or stage change is due  to a bump in computer processing power and adjunct technology, as we  will soon see. The UNIVAC was introduced in 1951 and IBM took over the  market with a long series of releases of mainframes and increasingly more  powerful machines  History, 1951 .   AI research and development continued in the 1960s, but slowed in the   1970s and then began to take another revolution in the 1980s. There are two  periods in AI history considered “AI winters.” The frst was from 1974 to  1980  Schuchmann, 2019 . Figure 7.1 illustrates the history of AI development  with an emphasis on the “AI winters” and the deep learning revolution. The  AI winters are lightly shaded.   Resurrection in the 1980s   AI had a major resurrection in the 1980s with the advent of expert systems.  An expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision-making  ability of a human expert. These systems did not approach AI the way    166  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Figure 7.1  History of AI development with emphasis on the “AI winters” and the  “deep learning revolution” that started about 2012  adapted from Schuchmann, 2019 .      procedural languages would or the way it is commonly handled, but did so  with more simple “if-then” rules.   There were two factors that gave rise to expert systems. First was the  adoption of the LISP language. The LISP language was developed in the  late 1950s by John McCarthy. LISP is the second-oldest high-level program- ming language in widespread use today. Only Fortran is older, by one year.    Dialects of LISP are still relevant with Hy for Python being introduced in  2013.      Second was the construction of actual hardware to support LISP – the   LISP machines. LISP machines had an optimized method of execution  and clock speed for processing. Specifc LISP chips were developed as it  appeared AI would revolutionize it all. There were many of these machines  developed. The Texas Instruments Explorer and the Apple Lisa are examples  of PCs developed for LISP. However, the resurgence of LISP also had its  problems  Cummins, 2018 .   Beyond the Second AI Winter     Another AI winter occurred from about 1987 or 1988 to 1993. After this  winter, there was a slow, then progressive expansion of AI. These expan-   sions were somewhat linear in nature. With more computer power some    of the promises of early AI could now be achieved. Adoption was slow but    steady. There were concerns for lack of transparency of AI as it produces    what are considered black box models. Unlike many of the methods we    saw in the last chapter, such as trees that can easily be interpreted, black    box models cannot be procedurally followed to understand the outcomes    it is generating. These concerns still exist today. In fact, as we discussed    in our frst chapter, there is an increasing regulation of machine learning  models.    AI and How It Differs from Machine Learning  ◾  167           Deep Learning, Bigger, and New Data   This period started about 2010–2011 and is the current state. Unlike the last  period, which was linear, this period has been exponential. Some of the  forces involved include:              1  Even More Computing Power  2  Deeper Learning  3  The Rise of Big Data Technology Adoption  4  The Rise of IoT  the Internet of Things   5  A Sharp Interest in Pattern Recognition  Audio, Video, Images               There should be no surprise that computing technology grows ever faster,  and memory gets cheaper; this allows for more widespread adoption of  techniques that were relegated to only those organizations with large bud- gets and resources to handle them. In short, processing and memory are  now cheap enough that it does not present a barrier to anyone wanting to  perform AI.   Deep learning has been around for a long time. Deep learning is really  just an extension of the artifcial neural networks we saw in the last chapter.  In simple terms, there are just more hidden layers. They require more time  to train, but in the end, can produce very powerful models. Research into  deep learning has exploded and given open source and other technology,  professionals many more options to apply these algorithms.   Figure 7.2 illustrates a simple artifcial neural network. This neural net-  work has one hidden layer. A deep learning model would have more depth  and more hidden layers. More than one hidden layer qualifes as “deep  learning”  Nicholson, 2019; Nisbet et al., 2017 .      The rise of big data technology adoption has to do with the devel- opment of the open source Apache Hadoop. Hadoop is available in open  source and commercial versions. It provides a highly scalable way to per- form data storage and machine model building. We will talk in depth about  this technology in Chapter 9, along with Spark  in-memory computing ,  which enables faster deep learning, but briefy here are some advantages:         1  It can be built on commodity hardware so businesses that wanted to     create data lakes often used Hadoop to do so.    a total cost of ownership, which we will cover in depth in our next book .   2  It is open source and so some consider it free  we know better; there is    168  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Figure 7.2  Simple artifcial neural network model.         3  It enables in-cluster model development.      Before Hadoop, the machine learning fow was to process and  structure all your data and bring it into the machine learning  platform. This meant bringing large amounts of data across the  network, and executing the machine learning algorithm inside  the machine learning platform. With in-cluster machine learn- ing, the algorithms were instead passed across the network from  the machine learning platform to the cluster where the data lived.  Passing algorithms is much faster and more secure than moving  loads of data.      The Internet of Things  IoT  has been growing expansively, and is  expected to double from its value of US$235 billion in 2017 to US$520 billion  by 2021  Columbus, 2018 . Think about Smart Cities where there are CCTV  and video cameras all over the city and streets. There are sensors buried  inside and along the roads. All these devices are collecting data around the  clock. Transportation companies have multiple geospatial and telemetry  devices in every vehicle of their feets. They collect this data continuously.  Factories have thousands of sensors collecting data on all of the manufactur- ing devices, along the factory foors and in the warehouses. Even passenger  planes are equipped with thousands of sensors and telemetry devices.    AI and How It Differs from Machine Learning  ◾  169           Pattern recognition has really taken off over the last several years   where AI deep learning is a very well-suited methodology for these types  of problems  Swathi, 2019 . AI produces highly reliable predictive results for  everything from images in hospitals  x-rays and various scans  to face recog- nition  airports and social media  to video  traffc cameras .   Given this great expanse of technology and almost “unlimited” data,     AI has become more of a “plug-and-play” solution for image recognition.    Moreover, the fact that many of these types of problems do not need a    great amount of transparency makes AI a great solution: for example, pat- tern recognition as used by social media platforms where users opt in    and sign away rights or are considered just content brokers and not content    police. Alternatively, airports  see the interesting example in the “Resources    for the Avid Learner” section at the end of this chapter with Justin Smith    and Liliana Petrova  and other public areas that in the United States do not    have deep privacy restrictions are great places for image recognition. AI is    hands-down better than any other technology at producing the best predic- tive models for image recognition. In addition, AI is valuable in IoT, telem- etry, and transportation, where the predictions are done inside a business    with tight controls.   Next-Generation AI   We are primarily focusing on algorithmic AI in this chapter and algorithmic  data science in general. However, to be fair, how AI will affect us in the  future has more to do with adoption and application of models into nearly  everything around us. Some of this will not be driven by algorithmic AI   artifcial neural networks and deep learning  but more by applying rules  and programming into products and services. Products around the world  are being flled with sensors and these sensors are becoming intelligent with  programming and embedded models inside them.   The major advancements in algorithmic AI are next-generation deep   learning  see gray box – “Beyond Catastrophic Forgetting” , enhancements  in multi-agent machine learning and computational creativity. A multi-agent    system is a computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent  agents  an autonomous entity that directs its activity toward achieving goals .  Computational creativity is used to model, simulate or replicate human cre- ativity using a computer toward goals or objectives  see Colton et al., 2009,  2015     170  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     An interesting and powerful quote can be found by Ramon López de   Mántaras  see López de Mántaras, 2018 :   No matter how intelligent future artifcial intelligences become,  they will never be the same as human intelligence: the mental  development needed for all complex intelligence depends on inter- actions with the environment and those interactions depend, in  turn, on the body – especially the perceptive and motor systems.   BEYOND CATASTROPHIC FORGETTING   One of the downsides of deep learning is something called catastrophic  interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting. It is the tendency of  an artifcial neural network to completely and abruptly forget previously  learned information upon learning new information. This phenomenon  was identifed many years ago. It has been and continues to be the sub- ject of research in artifcial neural networks and deep learning.   THE IMPORTANCE OF AI FOR   GOVERNMENT AND HEALTHCARE   Government is getting into AI in a big way. Of course, the intelligence  and defense areas of government are pushing the envelope with the help  of commercial and academic partners.   But  now,  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  Centers  for Medicare & Medicaid Services  CMS  is embracing AI as well. CMS  in  2019  announced  the  requirements  and  registration  for  the  “Artifcial  Intelligence Health Outcomes Challenge,” which offered US$1,000,000 in  prizes. It opened in June and there were over 300 applicants from aca- demia and corporate America; many were partnerships of the two.   The last day of October, they announced 25 entrants  of more than  300 submitted  that made it to the second round – www.cmschallenge.  ai . This demonstrates three things:      1  The government is getting smarter by adopting a crowd-sourcing model     to improve its operations and effectiveness.    AI and How It Differs from Machine Learning  ◾  171                 2  CMS is opening up to new methods and willing to pay real money to     get help.    3  Healthcare, while ahead with several successful machine learning appli- cations, is still very far behind consumer-based businesses. Seeing CMS  commit may bolster stronger investment and inroads into analytics.   The two objectives are expressed by CMS as follows:   Use  AI deep  learning  methodologies  to  predict  unplanned  hospi- tal and skilled nursing facility  SNF  admissions and adverse events  within  30  days  for  Medicare  benefciaries,  based  on  a  data  set  of  Medicare administrative claims data, including Medicare Part A  hos- pital  and Medicare Part B  professional services .   Develop  innovative  strategies  and  methodologies  to  explain  the  AI-derived predictions to front-line clinicians and patients to aid in  providing appropriate clinical resources to model participants, and  increase use of AI-enhanced data feedback for quality improvement  activities among model participants.   The  competition  will  conclude  in  September  2020,  but  we  look  for- ward to the results and more competitions like this where the spirit of  competition drives great, innovative results.   Differences of BI, Data Mining, Machine  Learning, Statistics vs AI   We covered the historical perspective of data mining, machine learning and  AI in the last chapter and earlier in this chapter. We found that AI is the  overarching term and that data mining was part of AI, but broke off into  a separate arm of research and then machine learning came into vogue.  However, history is a little different than the current vernacular. We want to  make you fuent in today’s terminology  and it is likely to change tomorrow  as the hype cycle spins . From a current practitioner perspective, we    offer the following summary.   Data mining and machine learning incorporate the majority of the same  methods. The latter is a more popular and descriptive term for what these    172  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     algorithms are doing, so one could use a single term: “machine learn- ing.” For most practitioners, machine learning encompasses AI models, so  it is bigger and broader  see Kuhn and Johnson, 2018; Nisbet et al., 2017 .  AI refers to mimicking the human brain to teach machines to think. The  human brain is made up of neurons connected by synapses, and cogni- tion is performed by linkage and fring of various neurons creating a neu- ral network. So, artifcial neural networks  neural nets for short  and deep  learning  which is an extension of neural networks  are the cornerstones of  AI. So when someone mentions a k-means clustering algorithm or a k-near- est-neighbors algorithm  and many more; see Chapter 6 , a data scientist  or practitioner will most likely think in terms of machine learning. If you  mention an artifcial neural network or deep learning algorithm to the same  person, they will likely think in terms of AI.   Strengths and Weakness   Algorithmic AI can be extremely powerful at creating highly predictive mod- els using very complex data not amenable to many other machine learning  techniques. It handles problems of complex, highly nonlinear systems very  well.   Some Weaknesses of AI                    1  Requires much more data to train build models  2  Requires more processing power and time  3  Models are not transparent or readable  4  Encodes correlation and not causation  5  Easily overtrains  shallow   6  Trains to narrow applications, very sensitive to population stability  7  Models may think locally  greedy   8  Models may be brittle and unpredictable                    Requires much more data to train build models   Unlike some of the techniques and methods we are covering in this book,  AI requires relatively large amounts of data. Business intelligence  BI  and  statistical techniques are favored for certain types of analysis and be useful  with much less data. Certain domains just do not produce enough data to    AI and How It Differs from Machine Learning  ◾  173           make these models useful. Healthcare is a prime example where small to  midsize organizations may not observe enough cases each year to make AI  a viable option.   Requires more processing power and time   Computing power has opened up the wide use of AI across industries and  applications. AI has reached all areas of business. It is in healthcare and gov- ernment. However, that does not mean it is cheap. Depending on the algo- rithm, size of data and complexity  e.g., how many layers   deep learning ,  it can be expensive. Companies like Google can support very deep models;  smaller organizations are limited by the cost of computation. AI algorithms  can take a lot of time and processing power to train, especially with high- dimensional, deep data  very wide and long tables of data . This can be  expensive and sometimes cost prohibitive. Moreover, AI models take longer  to train than most machine learning, statistical and BI methods. This is an  additional cost or burden.   Models are not transparent or readable   AI models are traditionally “black box” and as we have mentioned several    times are not acceptable in certain industries and applications  Bathaee,    2018; Rudin, and Radin, 2019; Airhart, 2019; Guidotti, Monreale, and    Pedreschi, 2019 . Areas of research, medicine and government regulation    require transparency, along with the ability to read and interpret how the    model is determining its outcomes, and therefore AI is not an appropri- ate solution. In contrast, many machine learning algorithms like deci- sion trees, statistical methods, and BI can produce models that are very    transparent.   Encodes correlation and not causation   We covered the differences between correlation and causation in Chapter    4, “Causation vs Correlation.” This is the MOST misunderstood and    abused area of data AI and machine learning. AI algorithms are    very good at fnding correlative factors and generating models that repre- sent these correlations. However, that does not mean they are causative     see Leetaru, January 2019 . More about these subjects with examples in    Chapters 8 and 10.    174  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Easily overtrains  shallow    AI models can easily overtrain without proper cross-validation. This means  that they perform very well on the data they are built with, but do not  extend well into unseen or future data. AI can learn the training set too  well. Without controls, AI will learn the data exactly. This will prevent the  model from being useful extensible with future data.   Trains to narrow applications, very sensitive to population stability   The deeper and more complex the model, the more apt it is to train to  specifc nuances in the data. So, a model might be thought to be useful in  a business case with a slight permutation or over time will not perform as  expected. This is a type of overtraining just mentioned. Data can change  over time  population stability . Models need to be retrained periodically,  and the more complex the AI model the more frequently they need to be  retrained.   Models may think locally  greedy    AI models may only search a limited, local space for their solution. We have  to “bound” the search space for these models; otherwise they would take  too long to train and require too much computation. And the optimal point  for a model input may occur outside our bounds, thus limiting the optimal  utility of the model.   Models may be brittle and unpredictable   AI can lead to very unpredictable results. Because they can be powerful  and precise, they use the data in very special and complex ways to compute  their outcomes. If new cases are introduced to the models that are outside  the bounds of data that the model ever saw when it trained, it may produce  a highly unexpected result  see the gray box, “AI Solves Diffcult Challenges,  but Comes Up Short on Simple Ones?” and Leetaru, June 2019 . Statistical  models are typically “more general than AI models,” meaning that when  a new observation comes to be predicted, AI is often more predictive: the  outcomes predicted are closer to reality than those from statistical models.  Yet the statistical models will typically not fail in outlier cases in which an  AI model might.    AI and How It Differs from Machine Learning  ◾  175           AI SOLVES DIFFICULT CHALLENGES, BUT   COMES UP SHORT ON SIMPLE ONES?   In 2017 Google’s AlphaGo defeated Ke Jie, the world’s number one Go  player, in the frst game of a three-part match. About a year before this,  AlphaGo  became  a  well-known  term  when  Korean  legend  Lee  Se-dol  demonstrated the power of AI  see: Byford, 2017 . Whether IBM Watson  or Google’s AlphaGo are equally powerful or can “do the same things  equally well” is problematic, but it appears it is like comparing “apples  and oranges,” as it they probably have different purposes. At least there  is one area where these two are different: Watson is excelling better in  commercialization, whereas AlphaGo seems to be doing better in aca- demia  see: Tak, 2017 . But even in that, IBM Watson was purchased by  M.D. Anderson Hospitals and after 5 years and a cost of US$62 million,  M.D. Anderson discontinued it in 2015 because it was “not performing as  they had expected” from what they had been led to believe from all the  “Hype.” And in fact it does a poor job of diagnosing individual patients,  probably one factor being that good patient medical databases are not  yet available for input.   Perhaps the most important lesson we have learned over the last    sixty years of AI is that what seemed most diffcult  e.g., playing    chess or Go at the highest level  have turned out to be relatively    easy, while what seemed easiest has turned out to be the most dif- fcult of all. The explanation for this apparent contradiction may be    found in the diffculty of equipping machines with the knowledge    that  constitutes  “common  sense.”  Without  common-sense  knowl- edge,  among  other  limitations,  it  is  impossible  to  obtain  a  deep    understanding  of  language  or  a  profound  interpretation  of  what    a  visual  perception  system  captures.  Common-sense  knowledge    is  the  result  of  our  lived  experiences.  Examples  include  “water    always fows downward,” “to drag an object tied to a string, you    have to pull on the string, not push it,” “a glass can be stored in a    cupboard, but a cupboard cannot be stored in a glass,” and so on.    Humans  easily  handle  millions  of  such  common-sense  data  that    allow us to understand the world we inhabit  López de Mántaras,    2018 .    176  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Some Strengths of AI                1  Extremely powerful for nonlinear and patten recognition  2  No need for labeling for many problems  3  Great results with unstructured data  4  Feature extraction can often be inherently covered  5  Now available to the citizen data scientist or analyst  6  Can process thousands of variables                Extremely powerful for nonlinear and patten recognition   Solving certain problems that are diffcult in other machine learning and  statistical algorithms can be competently handled with AI. Specifcally, pat- tern recognition and highly nonlinear problems are a breeze for AI. Pattern  recognition may include images, audio, video and streaming data. Many  statistical and machine learning algorithms were designed for problems with  approximately linear or piecewise linear  can be broken into a bunch of  contiguous linear  solutions. These methods do not perform as well as AI  when these assumptions are violated.   No need for labeling many problems   Imagine a classifcation problem where you are trying to label the data in a  large set of photographs and you need to specify the contents of each pic- ture – maybe wildlife like moose, deer, duck, etc. Or, in the medical indus- try where you are having a radiologist labeling CT scans as having a disease  or non-disease. This is quite tedious and very expensive, in the latter case  where the radiologist is quite expensive and would need to label thousands  of images for the classifcation model to predict accurately. AI is very forgiv- ing in this regard, as it can classify the images into clusters with high preci- sion and the data can be post labeled.   Great results with unstructured data   Most data is unstructured: for example text in documents, email, texts     some estimates put it at 80%, others higher at 90% [Mukhyala, 2019;    Grimes, August 2008; Beal, 2019] . AI is very useful in text analytics and    data mining tasks, outperforming many statistical and other machine learn- ing methods.    AI and How It Differs from Machine Learning  ◾  177           Feature extraction can often be inherently covered   Feature extraction is one example of using formulas, rules or even models  to take data and add structure to it for use in modeling to make the models  have higher predictive accuracy. One example might be using a combina- tion of variables to defne a business rule. Imagine your organization has a  formula rule for classifying a “Gold, Silver or Platinum” customer. You may  apply this rule to the data set prior to the modeling process. Or, you might  use a statistical method such as principal components analysis, where you  reduce dozens or hundreds of variables into a few important components.  You may start with 200 raw variables and compress the information in these  variables down into the six most important components. AI can do some of  this work automatically by learning these relationships within the algorithm,  requiring no explicit task of feature extraction.   Now available to the citizen data scientist or analyst   With some of these items just mentioned like powerfully modeling nonlinear  relationships and not needing up-front feature extraction, along with new  easy-to-use interfaces and automatic solution search capabilities for model  parameters, what was once only available for the sophisticated user or data  scientist can now be used by a business analyst or what is called the citizen  data scientist. More about the citizen data scientist in the next chapter.   Can process thousands of variables   Another strength of the AI and machine learning methods is that they can  handle thousands of variables. The constraints are computational power and  memory. Contrast this to BI, which can handle only a handful of variables at  a time. Additionally, some statistical models are designed for smaller subsets  of variables as well.   AI’s Future   “How ‘Rosy’ is the FUTURE for AI?”   AI at its highest level can be defned as the “simulation of human intelli- gence” by machines. This means that machines would  will…   be able to  demonstrate things like:    178  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     ◾  Learning    ◾  Reasoning    ◾  Self-correction     The growth of AI has been phenomenal in recent years. The future growth  of AI is not clear: there may be another “winter phase,” no one knows. Yet  AI is starting to invade all aspects of our lives, and soon may have invaded  almost everything that occupies our daily lives as human beings.   Listed below are some of the many ways AI may be in our lives in the   future:   ◾  AI will transform how we do and the output of science    ◾  Use of AI in cybersecurity may fnally prevent all hacking    ◾  Facial recognition may go beyond physical structure to understanding     ◾  AI may be able to perceive patterns in data that humans cannot    ◾  Real driverless car and trucks  with NO human inside  may happen in     emotions   just 2–3 years   ◾  Robotic process automation will be the norm in our workplaces     FROM: Viswanathan, December, 2018   But could another “winter phase” occur before AI reaches its highest levels?  Please take a look at the following gray box for some ideas on this.   WILL THERE BE ANOTHER “AI WINTER”?   The self-driving cars that we are currently hearing about and seeing tested  appear not to be happening as fast as were predicted. Tesla founder Elon  Musk had announced that a fully autonomous car would be on the roads  in 2018  he made this prediction in 2015 . And, General Motors predicted  2019 – but it is early December 2019 as we are writing this chapter and  we doubt this goal will be realized by the end of the month. Ford has  been more cautious, predicting 2021. Well, that is up to 2 years from now,  so maybe it will happen? Or maybe not? In March of this year  2019  a  pedestrian in Arizona was killed by an Uber in “driverless mode”  a per- son was in the car, but was not attending to the driving process . So what  does this predict?    AI and How It Differs from Machine Learning  ◾  179           Deep learning has hit some walls: The neural nets seem to stop learn- ing  after  a  certain  point  and  there  is  a  problem  with  “generalization.”  An  example  of  this  is  that  a  machine  trained  to  recognize  housecats  couldn’t recognize larger wild cats like tigers and lions. AI winters of the  past have probably happened because people have predicted that certain  things would happen, but they did NOT happen because the science was  not yet “ready.” So are we at a stage here in late 2019 and 2020 where  we have again come up against a “wall”? The next 2–3 years will prob- ably answer this, if these “blockages” continue and a third winter sets in   Cummins, 2018 .   This has been a small chapter on a very big subject. We have provided some  historical perspectives and ideas for useful applications as well as some  drawbacks to the use of AI. We have covered some strengths and weak- nesses of AI and some areas of application. In the next chapter, we cover  the discipline of data science and the data scientist. Both are big users  of AI!

Chapter 8  What Is Data Science?   Keywords: Data Engineering, Subject Matter Experts, Citizen Data Scientists,  Computer Science, ML  Machine Learning , AI  Artifcial Intelligence , BI   Preamble   In the last chapter, we covered AI and how it differs from the other methods  covered in this book. We have now covered many of the techniques that  data scientists use – data mining, machine learning, and AI. We will explore  the use of big data in the next chapter and fnally statistics in Chapter 10.  This will complete the major tools in the toolbox of the data scientist that  we feel should be “the essentials that every data scientist should know.”   Now, we explore the fundamental questions:   So, what is data science?, and   What does a data scientist do?   Introduction   Data science is not nearly as old as AI, machine learning or data mining. In  fact, the term is attributed to a statistician, William S. Cleveland, who worked  at Bell Labs and Purdue University. Dr. Cleveland defned data science as  it is used today in a talk at the 1999 biennial meeting of the International  Statistical Institute, and in a 2001 paper  see Cleveland, 2001 . The paper  was republished in 2014  see Cleveland, 2014  together with a discussion   183    184  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     and with another paper about Divide and Recombine  D&R, a statistical  technique  with Tessera  see Cleveland, 2014, described next, which requires  research in all technical areas of data science. For avid readers, see the  “Resources for the Avid Learner” references, Tung et al., 2018  for more on  D&R.   According to Cleveland:   The technical areas of data science that have an impact on how a  data analyst analyses data in practice are:  1  Statistical theory;  2   Statistical models;  3  Statistical and machine learning methods;  4   Algorithms for statistical and machine learning methods and opti- mization;  5  Computational environments for data analysis; and  6   Live analyses of data where results are judged by the fndings, not  the methodology and systems that were used.   The implications for an academic department are that it is not  necessary that each individual be a researcher in all these areas.  Rather, collectively, the department needs to have people who do  research in all these areas. There must be an exchange of knowl- edge so that all department members have at least a basic under- standing of all technical areas.   We considered leaving the second paragraph above off, but we feel it impor- tant to clarify the unicorn misnomer. When the term “data scientist” frst  came out, it gave the impression to many that it required a very rare breed  of professional: someone that had a deep understanding in all the areas of  data management, data manipulation and cleansing, computer science and  machine learning expertise, statistical and mathematical skills, and was a  subject matter expert  SME  of the industry or application of the technology   e.g., fnance, operations, marketing, healthcare . Or, according to Gil Press,  who stated in a great article, “A Very Short History of Data Science”  see  Press, 2013  in September 2005, the National Science Board published “Long- Lived Digital Data Collections: Enabling Research and Education in the 21st  Century.” The latter report stated:   The NSF, working in partnership with collection managers and the  community at large, should act to develop and mature the career  path for data scientists and to ensure that the research enterprise  includes a suffcient number of high-quality data scientists.    What Is Data Science?  ◾  185           The report defnes data scientists as: the information and computer  scientists, database and software engineers and programmers, dis- ciplinary experts, curators, and expert annotators, librarians, archi- vists, and others, who are crucial to the successful management of  a digital data collection.   However, this defnition created unicorns because you could not fnd any- one who checked every box. The expectations nowadays are more realistic,  realizing that data science is a team sport and that you bring together a  team that in concert can execute on all related activities.   A blog post on a very popular website for data science, Data Science      Central, begins by stating that “Data Science can be practically defned as  the process by which we get extra information from data”  see Seif, July  2018 . That may be true, but you could replace data science with business  intelligence  BI , statistics, machine learning, data mining, data engineering,    decision science or operations research. Does that mean that data science  overarches all of those domains? The short answer is “yes,” a data scientist  should be aware and may use knowledge of all those domains to complete  their analytics activities. Thus, data science is more of an accumulation  of knowledge across the primary, traditional scholastic domains of  computer science, applied mathematics and statistics, and engineer- ing, as well as domain specifc-knowledge  to what area or feld they  apply this knowledge . Data science applications reach across virtually  every sector of the economy. Data scientists apply methods that are well  beyond what might be considered traditional data science. Why primary  scholastics domains? Because it is pervasive in virtually all university pro- grams in one way or another.            WHAT’S IN A NAME? APPARENTLY A LOT   FOR MASTER DEGREE PROGRAMS   Many programs that were labeled as Masters of Science in Data Analytics,  Business  Analytics  or  Predictive  Analytics  are  changing  their  names.  Scott worked previously with Northwestern University in the School of  Professional Studies  SPS , Masters of Science in Predictive Analytics. The  university has since renamed the predictive analytics program in the SPS  to the Masters of Science in Data Science  although they still have an ana- lytics program in the McCormick School of Engineering . Scott currently    186  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     teaches in the Masters of Science in Data Science at City University of  New York  CUNY , part of the SPS. When he started with CUNY the pro- gram was called Masters of Science in Data Analytics.   Why  all  the  name  changes?  Chasing  the  most  in  vogue  terms.  Yes,      the  curriculum  changes  a  bit  and  of  course  it  should,  even  without  a  name change. Another interesting dynamic that is responsible for these    name changes, is that the university wants to stay innovative and with    the times.   Mushing All the Terms – Same Thing?   In the book Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know about Data  Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking, Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett  see  Provost, 2013  state in the opening of Chapter 1:   The terms “data science” and “data mining” often are used inter- changeably, and the former has taken a life of its own as various  individuals and organizations try to capitalize on the current hype  surrounding it. At a high level, data science is a set of fundamental  principles that guide extraction of knowledge from data.   We do not agree that data science and data mining are the same. In fact, the  primary reason for writing this book was to distinguish and clarify the use  of all these terms. Just as engineering uses mathematics, but is not math- ematics, and electrical engineering uses physics, but is not physics, data  science uses data mining and machine learning but is not data mining. In  fact, data science is the broadest term in this entire book – data scientists  may apply BI and visualization, statistics, data mining, machine learning and  AI methods, big data, linear and mathematical programming, computer sci- ence and engineering as well as subject matter expertise! That is the reason  we are covering these domains to help clarify differences, strengths and  weaknesses and not just a morphing terminology based on hype.      We strongly agree with Provost and Fawcett when they declare: “At a high   level, data science is a set of fundamental principles that guide the extrac- tion of knowledge from data.” In addition, we also agree with authors that  declare that decision-making should be data-driven.    What Is Data Science?  ◾  187           EXAMPLE OF FAKE NEWS   One reason we wrote this book is to clear up some confusion and hype  in the analytics space. We are not perfect and we are sure there are some  mistakes in our work, but we go a long way to vet references by cross-ref- erencing with other sources or our own writing. You will fnd a lot of un- referenced opinions around analytics  and other  topics. We ran across a  lot of this “fake news” on the Internet and provide a couple of examples  here  we will not cite references to avoid any embarrassment . One opin- ion  article  in  a  popular  ezine  stated  that  data  science  started  in  2008:  “Coined by Jeff Hammerbacher and DJ Patil in Silicon Valley in 2008, the  data scientist is facing new challenges.” This, of course, is not true; there  are credible, published references to the term in 2001 as we have noted.  Another  source  is  a  popular  international  news  website:  “Interestingly,  the term data scientist, coined in 2008, has often been credited to Patil  and Jeff Hammerbacher, who back then were leads of data and analytics  efforts  at  LinkedIn  and  Facebook  respectively.”  One  of  the  very  inter- esting things about the Internet is that fake news gets propagated very  quickly and cycles and cycles as if the more times it is repeated the more  accurate it is; of course, however, this is not so. It is true that the White  House announced Dr. Patil as the frst U.S. Chief Data Scientist  Deputy  Chief  Technology  Offcer  for  Data  Policy  and  Chief  Data  Scientist   on  February 18, 2015. Also, Dr. Patil was coauthor with Thomas Davenport  of an important article on data science – “Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job  of  the  21st  Century”  in  Harvard  Business  Review   see  Davenport  and  Patil, 2012 .   There is truth in replacing those terms in a rotation, because at times  a data scientist will be a data engineer, at times a statistician, at times a  machine learning or AI developer, at times a storyteller. The job is multi- faceted and that is what makes it so interesting and rewarding. We have  covered many of the “most desired jobs” in Chapter 1, and data science is  one of the hottest careers out there – Glassdoor rated it as the 1 Job for 4  years in a row in their 50 Best Jobs in America Report. Zhang reported in  InfoWorld that data science openings have grown 256% since December  2013  see Zhang, August 2019 .   So, what is the key difference between a BI developer and a data scientist?   Or, a statistician and a data scientist? A BI developer has one key domain    188  ◾        It’s All Analytics!      and yes, there may be other activities such as data sourcing and some  advanced analytics activities , but the majority of their time is spent in BI.  A statistician may be versed in a few areas, but their primary trade is per- forming statistical analysis or developing statistical theory. A data scientist is  more of an application generalist, meaning, depending on the project they  are working on, they may apply the entire spectrum of BI, machine learn- ing, AI and statistics  and others such as decision science and mathematical  programming discussed in Chapter 11 .   “Data science” was created as a new term to encompass several of the   new challenges. Early on, it encompassed some broad areas of the business  domain, visual analytics, advanced statistical and machine learning algo- rithms and data sourcing, processing, broad architecture and deployment   sourcing and cleaning of data and at the end of the process, deployment  of models, which may be done by data engineers . Because these skills are  both deep and wide, very few people possessed all of them. Thus, data sci- entists were called “unicorns,” as some people did not think they existed or  at a minimum, they were so rare that they were rarely, if ever, seen.      The feld has evolved and data engineering has now become a feld of its   own. Simply put, data engineers are very skilled at data management and  areas of computer software engineering. To put it bluntly, they are very good  at piping and processing data for the modeling work and taking the analytic  models and pushing them out for production   operational systems. Today,  as part of the team you will see members that are more quantitatively and  algorithm focused, certainly with knowledge, if not at an expert level, of the  business or the data piping. You will have members that again have some  knowledge of the algorithms and data engineering, but are more business  focused in their expertise. In addition, of course, you will have some that  exhibit data engineering as their superpower, but they have a level of under- standing of the other components. We see this as an ideal team for midsized  to large companies.   As best we can tell, by today’s defnition, a data scientist is someone with   knowledge and experience in at a minimum a combination of a few of the  following  the more the better :          1  Data Engineering  Database and Software Engineering   2  Computer Science and Coding  3  Subject Matter   Domain Experts – Healthcare, Government or Business         Function    What Is Data Science?  ◾  189                4  Applied Mathematics, Econometrics, Informatics or Statistics  5  BI or Visualization        Today’s Data Science?   As we have stated, the new term “data science” was created to encompass  several of the new challenges. And, to focus on something important that  Dr. Cleveland said, “Live analyses of data where results are judged by the  fndings, not the methodology and systems that were used.” We want to  clarify or correct this statement by Dr. Cleveland. We believe data science  should embrace all relevant techniques and methods that present relative  information. This requires knowledge and appropriate application. What this  means is that it does not matter if it is a BI technique, a statistical technique,  a machine learning technique or an AI technique that is applied by the data  scientist, as long as it used correctly.   Data Science vs BI and Data Scientist   We like the following statement in an opinion piece on “Dataversity” by  Paramita  Guha  Ghosh  see Ghosh, 2018 :     Data Science, as used in business, is intrinsically data-driven,  where many interdisciplinary sciences are applied together to  extract meaning and insights from available business data, which  is typically large and complex. On the other hand, Business  Intelligence or BI helps monitor the current state of business data  to understand the historical performance of a business.   We like it because it does describe the difference between data science and  BI while at the same time suggesting another important differentiator. Just  because BI may not be strictly part of data science, it does not mean that  data scientists do not use BI tools.   Data Science vs Data Engineering vs Citizen Data Scientist   We covered the evolution of the term “data science.” In the “unicorn” days,  data science included what is now considered a separate discipline, data  engineering. In researching many defnitions and descriptions, we think    190  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Dhiraj Rajaram  see Rajaram, 2018  has delineated some key differences  between these two domains:   Data engineering is the application of technology to help collect,  store, process, transform and structure data to enable it to be used  for decision support.   Data science is the application of math and technology to solve  focused business problems. This involves analysis, visualization  and algorithmic mathematical computations to extract insights in  response to clearly defned business problems, and questions and  hypotheses using clearly identifed data elements.   We add that data science integrates and builds on data engineering by  adding data exploration, analytics, and modeling. As part of the continued  evolution and the unicorn problem, another role has emerged: the citizen    data scientist. The citizen data scientist normally comes from a business or  functional role within the organization. They know the processes, the data  and the problems encountered in this functional area very well. They typi- cally start gaining more technical expertise in data management or one of  the other forms of analytics  see Chapter 4 . They are similar to “business  analysts.” However, traditionally, business analysts sit between IT and the  business. The citizen data scientists sit between the functional unit and the  analytics center of excellence group  Chapter 2 , or between the functional  area and a data scientist or data science group.   PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER: AN EXAMPLE OF   THE DATA SCIENCE TEAM IN ACTION   We have mentioned that data science is a team sport. So, let’s look at a  fctitious but realistic data science project and what the team roles might  look like in a clinical initiative. Dr. Susan Becker is a chief medical offcer  at a large integrated healthcare system. She knows that hospital-related  costs associated with delirium are estimated to range from US$143 billion  to US$152 billion nationally  see Leslie and Inouye, November 2011  and  that it is a major concern for their health system. She puts forth a proposal  to reduce costs and negative outcomes within the hospitals in the system.  Her proposal is detailed and focuses on high-impact areas  cardiac sur- gery, neurosurgery, trauma; see Schubert et al., July 2018  and while the    What Is Data Science?  ◾  191           team would use data across the system to build the solution, the results  would be piloted in two hospitals so the impacts can be measured. Her  proposal  is  approved  and  funded  by  the  board.  She  is  the  executive    sponsor of the project with board oversight. She now puts together the  following team to support the project.      SMEs – Nurses, physicians, and paraprofessionals from cardiac sur- gery, neurosurgery, and trauma in a representative sample of the hospital  system. These SMEs will serve a vital role in the team providing context,  process knowledge and experience in the entire care spectrum and treat- ment of these patients.   Data Engineers – Experts in the sourcing and initial preparation of the      data with the help of SMEs, citizen data scientists and data analysts. They  will also help push the analytic models into production. They will work    with  software  developers  to  provide  model  results  into  a  user-friendly      interface that care providers will use at the point of care. If an organization  does not have dedicated data engineers they may draw expertise from IT    such as database administrators  DBAs , data architects and data modelers.  Citizen  Data  Scientists  –  Work  within  the  team  and  help  bridge  gaps between the SMEs and data engineers and data scientists. Since they  are knowledgeable in the general process as well as some of the techni- cal components, they can translate between the groups. They can also  prototype, provide intermediate analysis and work with the developers to  design appropriate interfaces for action.   Data Scientists and Data Modelers – Work on a broad spectrum of  the project. In projects that do not have a complete team  unlike what we  have here  a data scientist may “pinch hit” or fll in for missing roles, since  they typically have broad skillsets. For Dr. Baker’s team, since she has a  full spectrum of team members, the data scientist will serve primarily in  the data analysis and machine learning modeling roles.   Software  Engineers  –  Work  with  the  team  and  very  closely  with  data  engineers  to  develop  interfaces  and  embed  machine  learning,  AI  and analytic models into related systems. These might be as simple as  a  computer  user  interface  or  as  complicated  as  an  edge  device  or  IoT   Internet of Things  device.   Team construction is highly variable, but we hope this provides some  insight into what a team might look like. We cover these concepts deeply  in our book on designing an integrated AI, analytics and data science  architecture for your organization  see Burk and Miner, 2021 .    192  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DATA SCIENTISTS   AND PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS PROFESSIONALS?   We want to point out there are nuances in how professionals are catego- rized in the job market. Burtch Works, a recruiting company for both data  science and predictive analytics professionals, and one of Forbes’ 2019  America’s Best Executive Recruiting Firms markets both types of domain  professionals. In their June 2019 study of salaries for these two types of  professionals  in The Burtch Works Study – see Burtch, 2019 , they defne  data scientists to be a specifc type of predictive analytics professional.  So there is a signifcant overlap where both roles garner insights and pre- scribe action, but data scientists have additional skills. These additional  skills may include focusing on cleaning and analyzing unstructured or  streaming data, and using sophisticated computer science and program- ming  coding  skills that are not typically seen in the profles of other  predictive analytics professionals. We cover what we mean by streaming  data in the next chapter, but it is a fairly hot and novel topic. Unstructured  data may include video streams, audio data, social media web scrapes,  sensor  data,  raw  log  fles  or  long  blocks  of  written  language.  We  also  cover these data types in the chapter on data  Chapter 9 . So, according to  the Burtch study, data scientist job descriptions often include additional  specifcations above and beyond predictive analytic professional require- ments. But, they also say: “The distinction between roles in predictive  analytics and data science [is] growing fuzzier by the day.” This is further  confrmation that even professional recruiters in the industry see signif- cant overlap between the felds.      CHALLENGES AND SUCCESSES IN DATA SCIENCE TEAMS   CHALLENGES: We are at the peak  maybe?  of “AI Hype,” so one of  the challenges for data science teams is understanding “where” and “how  much” each of the components of “data science” ft and what role they  play. AI is not for every problem; it is only useful for some. Companies  look toward data science with big expectations, and thus invest in it; BUT  it has been reported that up to 77% of businesses report challenges, and  do not complete their “data science projects”; thus ¾ of all projects are    What Is Data Science?  ◾  193           dormant – collecting dust. And such disappointments mean that the team  loses its energy for pushing for more data science projects. Thus, we’d  have to say that overall most projects are unsuccessful, unfortunately.   SUCCESSES: The use of “data science” and “data analytics” is essen- tial  for  any  organization’s  growth  in  the  new  age.  And  about  25–30%  of data science projects in organizations and businesses are successful.  There are no shortcuts for success. But there are fve things that appear to  considered and applied carefully for success, and these are the following:               1. Motivation and Vision: The organization needs MOTIVATION and    VISION about the use of data science, not for the short term, but as a  long-term goal.  2. Infrastructure: The data science team needs both “quality data” and    “suitable infrastructure” that allows successful working with that data.  3. Hiring:  There  are  as  few  experienced  data  science  “unicorns”  out    there as before. The supply of qualifed people has not yet reached  the need. THUS, to attract data scientists with experience one needs  to look beyond salary, but at such things as: a  curiosity needs, b  use  of new technology needs, and c  their need to be challenged by new  opportunities and new business objectives, and given the atmosphere  to “go after it unhindered.”  4. Delivery:  Overcoming  “technical  challenges”  is  the  most  important    consideration here, as “deployment of models” appears to be the big- gest  bottleneck  for  success.  For  a  data  science  team  to  be  commer- cially successful it needs a delivery pipeline which meets the following  requirements:  –  Evaluate  a  large  number  of  incumbent  and  challenger  models  in        parallel   –  Manage the model life cycle    –  Handle an increasing heterogeneity of data science toolkits    –  Allow  experimentation  in  production  without  impacting  the  user    experience and decouple the business objectives from the data sci- ence objectives   –  Decouple  enterprise      Service-Level  Agreements  and GDPR  General Data Protection Regulation  from  the data science models   requirements   like  SLAs   –  Scale this to peaks of 50+K page loads per minute without hiring     armies of DevOps engineers    194  ◾        It’s All Analytics!             5. Employee  Retention:  The  “culture”  of  an  organization  can  be  the  most important thing for retaining good employees. Company perks  and beneft packages just “do not do it” for the creative people that  are  good  “data  scientists.”  Instead  this  type  of  person  needs  to  feel  that their work makes a “real impact.” If the CEO and decision mak- ers are slow to understand and respond, the “team” can become very  frustrated,  good  work  grinds  to  a  halt  and  eventually  people  leave.  Delivery, adopting new technology and forward thinking are all impor- tant  to  employee  retention,  which  leads  to  long-term  success  of  the  data science program.   Above  adapted  from  Jan  Teichmann.  2019.  “How  to  make  a  success  story  of  your  data  science  team,”  KDnuggets,  www.kdnuggets.com 20    19 06 success-story-data-science-team.html.                                    Backgrounds of Data Analytics Professionals   Previously we have commented about the job responsibilities of analytics  professionals in data science. We need to emphasize that since there is a  dearth of candidates that fully meet the job descriptions, hiring people are  looking more for skills and “skillsets” regardless of education. However, it is  useful to take a look at the suggested qualifcations of study for some of the  jobs, so we briefy cover that, as follows:   ◾  Data Engineers    ◾  Data Scientists    ◾  Citizen Data Scientists     Data Engineers: TRAINING AND PREPARATION: Typically, one needs  a bachelor’s degree in computer science, software computer engineering,  applied math, physics, statistics or a related feld and a LOT of real-world  experiences  internships, etc.   2U, Inc., 2019; Vohra, 2019 .   Data Engineer defnition: “A data engineer is a worker who primarily pre-  pares data for analytical or operational uses”  Rouse, 2016 .   Data Scientists: TRAINING AND PREPARATION: A data scientist needs   training skills in programming, statistics, machine learning, linear algebra  and calculus, data wrangling and software engineering  Talari, 2018 . Others    What Is Data Science?  ◾  195           think these skills can be obtained by earning a bachelor’s degree in IT, com- puter science, math, physics or related feld; AND earning a master’s degree  in data or related feld; AND FINALLY gaining experience in the feld you    intend to work in  e.g., healthcare, physics, business . All are essential to be  seriously considered by an HR hiring offcial  Get-Educated, 2019 .   Data Scientist defnition: “A data scientist is an individual, organization   or application that performs statistical analysis, data mining and retrieval  processes on a large amount of data to identify trends, fgures, and other  relevant information”  Techopedia, 2019 .   Citizen Data Scientists: TRAINING AND PREPARATION: You will  not fnd a job listing for “citizen data scientist” even though the term has  existed for a couple of years. A successful “analytics – data science program”  involves a “hybrid organization structure,” as we have discussed at length  in Chapter 2 of this book. A “citizen data scientist” will function in making  predictive   prescriptive analytic models even though they have not been  primarily educated in statistics and analytics. “Citizen data scientist” is not  yet fully defned, but it involves “skills needed” and if the company hiring  cannot fnd a “data scientist” with the right skills, but fnds a person with  another job title but having the skills, they will hire “for the skills.” Gartner  also predicts that citizen data scientists will surpass data scientists in the  amount of advanced analysis produced by 2019  see Gartner Press Release,  2017; Arora, 2019 .   Citizen Data Scientist defnition: “A person who creates or generates   models that use advanced diagnostic analytics or predictive and prescriptive  capabilities, but whose primary job function is outside the feld of statistics  and analytics”  Idoine, 2018; Arora, 2019 .   Again, let us emphasize here that in Chapter 2 of this book we make a     strong case that “Data Science Is a Team Sport.” This means that is a group of    people all working together, each having different skillsets  some with over- lapping skills , to form a “hybrid organization” that is able to get the job done!!   NETFLIX PRIZE, KAGGLE AND CROWD SOURCING   It started with the Netfix Prize, an open competition offered by Netfix  for the best collaborative fltering algorithm  a technique used by recom- mender systems; see “Association, Rules and Recommender Systems” in  Chapter 6 . Netfix started the competition on October 2, 2006. Netfix  offered  a  million  dollars  for  the  team  that  could  beat  Netfix’s  current       196  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     algorithm by 10% among other rules and stipulations. Within days, there  were teams beating Netfix’s algorithm  Cinematch , but not by a wide  enough margin to win the prize. The prize was awarded on September  21, 2009 to BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which beat Cinematch by  10.06%. Netfix was to offer a second prize in 2010, but canceled it on  March 12, 2010 due to Federal Trade Commission  FTC  privacy concerns.  The Netfix Prize was a great example of teams competing against each  other  to  improve  their  techniques  and  the  entire  feld  of  data  science.  With every iteration of development, teams improved their recommenda- tions from 2006 to 2009.   Kaggle was founded in April 2010. It is an online community of data    scientists  and  machine  learners.  It  allows  collaboration  and  sharing  of    data sets, exploring and building models and much more. It got its start    by allowing team-based competitions in machine learning. Many of these    competitions are hosted by companies and foundations with the goal of    solving diffcult and meaningful problems. One interesting and representa- tive example was a competition hosted by the Michael J. Fox Foundation.    The foundation offered a US$10,000 prize to the team with the best plan to    leverage an existing data set collected from a group of Parkinson’s patients    and controls using a basic smartphone application. The competition chal- lenged research teams to develop the best way to improve diagnosis, treat- ment or therapeutic development in Parkinson’s through analysis of these    passively  collected,  objective  data  points.  The  development  of  the  app    and collection of the data were led by researchers, collaborating entrepre- neurs and industry experts at Gecko Ventures and MIT. Researchers from    LIONsolver, Inc. won frst prize on April 24, 2013.   These two examples illustrate the power and effcacy of invoking the  wisdom of the crowd. The wisdom of the crowd is the collective opin- ion  of  a  group  of  individuals  rather  than  that  of  a  single  expert.  By  allowing teams to compete for these prizes, innovation is accelerated and  enriched. See about the CMS AI challenge in Chapter 7, in the gray box,  “The Importance of AI for Government and Healthcare.”   Young Professionals’ Input on What Makes a Great Data Scientist   To get the current pulse of young professional students, Scott has open  forums in his Master of Science in Data Science classes at CUNY. All    What Is Data Science?  ◾  197           students that post are working professionals in their early careers, typically  with 3 to 10 years of professional experience. They live and breathe data sci- ence in the program. Here are a few selected excerpts from discussion posts  in 2019.   To me, what makes a Data Scientist great is an array of both tech- nical skills and soft skills. Soft skills include communication, time  management, problem-solving skills, multitasking and being able to  convince the audience why your model works and have the data  tell a story. Technical skills include programming, Mathematics,  Statistics and domain knowledge of the problem you are trying to  solve.   A Data Scientist must have knowledge of concepts such as  elementary Algebra, Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics,  Calculus… Next, programming Computer Science. The great Data  Scientist must not only be a good programmer in the languages  he or she uses, but also Computer Science topics like Machine  Learning, Deep Learning, Algorithms, Databases be it relational like  MySQL or NOSQL like MongoDB. Other important topics such as  Natural Language Processing, Web Analytics, Artifcial Intelligence,  and Cloud Computing may have to come into play depending on  the industry he or she is in.   Finally, the data scientist to be great should be an SME in the  industry they are in be it in health, fnance, energy, education or  social sciences to name a few. You can get great scores in your  Kaggle competition or walk out of this program with a 4.0 GPA,  but if you don’t know your domain, chances are it will be diffcult  to explain the fndings to your customers or peers. This brings me  to the next set of qualities of a great Data Scientist: soft-skills.   Soft skills are applicable anywhere in life in general but in the  workforce, platform or academia, a Data Scientist must be a good  communicator. Being able to communicate and be clear in your  analysis and fndings is crucial as this is what others will base  your work and value on. The great Data Scientist must be able to  answer the right questions and convince people. Also, it is vital for  people to understand what it is you are trying to convey. You can’t  assume everyone is a Data Scientist so breaking things down for  the layperson to understand will pay off. It also helps to use proper  grammar and punctuation to get your story across…    198  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Time management and multitasking are also important as a Data   Scientist may have to juggle multiple projects and deadlines and  should know when to prioritize their workload.   For me, I think the core of who a data scientist is a person that   correctly uses data to solve data-related problems. The “correct”  comes from knowing and then applying the proper math, applica- tions of algorithms, appropriateness of visualizations, etc. to pro- vide a solution.     The “research data scientist” will likely be very deep in the   technical nitty-gritty details, but won’t need to be an SME in a feld.  And they may only need to be really good at visualization, math or  algorithm development, especially when working as part of a team  of data scientists or other researchers that together can cover all of  the bases you mentioned above.   Having a SME is crucial, but I don’t think the data scientist   needs to be it [implies the team sport approach and it is becoming  evident that data science is indeed a team effort – author’s note].  …To this end, I would say that the data scientist needs to be able  to at least translate what is happening in the modeling visualiza- tion etc. into the business speak, and the SME  or somebody else   will need to translate the business requirements into the technical  data requirements. It’s great when the SME and the data scientist  are the same person, but I don’t think this happens much or is  necessary.   THE MOST MISUNDERSTOOD CONCEPT   IN DATA SCIENCE TODAY   It is amazing how many articles that are written today that describe pre- scriptive  analytics  as  just  a  different  business  case  of  predictive  analyt- ics with no additional requirements from the data side or the modeling      side. It is absolutely one of the least understood paradigms out here. YOU  CANNOT SIMPLY USE OBSERVATIONAL DATA AND A MACHINE    LEARNING  ALGORITHM  AND  GENERATE  A  PRESCRIPTIVE      MODEL. NO. We are sorry to be so belligerent here, but there are  hundreds of articles and references out there that imply you can!!    We have even had conversations with people that know that causation is      not correlation, but still think they can guide results based on inputs. We    What Is Data Science?  ◾  199           will not cite anyone or any article in order not to discredit anyone. Without      getting  too  deep  in  the  weeds   we  will  dive  a  bit  deeper  into  statistics  in Chapter 10 , just be aware there are many reasons you cannot take a    predictive model and then declare it as a prescriptive model. We will now    describe a simple example illustrating what statisticians call a “lurking vari- able.” A lurking variable can falsely identify a strong relationship between    variables or it can hide the true relationship. Let’s look at the latter case,      where a variable hides a true relationship. Consider a simple fve-variable    model to predict obesity by measuring BMI  body mass index . BMI is a  weight-to-height ratio, calculated by dividing one’s weight in kilograms by    the square of one’s height in meters and used as an indicator of obesity and    underweight. Suppose we use the following fve variables to predict BMI:              1  Sex  male female   2  Number of hours per week in the gym or ftness center  3  Amount of diet soda intake per week  4  Age  5  Geographic location  place of residence                  Those  fve  factors  would  do  a  decent  job  predicting  BMI  via  a  machine learning model given that we can train the model correctly and  with enough data. This model will likely generalize, meaning that it will  predict  BMI  of  individuals  with  future  data   given  ordinary,  common  assumptions .  Good  predictive  model  –  PASS!  Now,  if  you  believe  the  many  posts,  articles,  and  misdirection  out  on  the  Internet  and  in  some books, you can use this model to PRESCRIBE actions to lower  your BMI. NO! You cannot relocate someone to Colorado or Hawaii and  expect it to have a practical effect. Colorado and Hawaii have lower BMIs  on average due to culture and genetics – not geography. Culture and  genetics are lurking variables  they relate to location and BMI   and they are causal, NOT geography. Good prescriptive model –  FAIL! This is just one reason a predictive model may not be prescriptive:  more on that in the next chapter.         There are two more potentially incorrect levers that you might try to  pull – the amount of soda and number of hours per week in the gym or  ftness center. We will leave that as a thought exercise as to why that may  be the case. Pulling these levers may have either have no effect or the  opposite effect of what might be predicted in this case.    200  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     We will talk about making the appropriate assumptions as well as meth- odologically sound ways to turn predictive models into prescriptive models  in Chapter 10.   Summary   “Data science” is an umbrella term; it is useful in sourcing knowledge and  applications across various domains. A data scientist may pull knowledge  from virtually any technical or economic sector to solve real data-driven  problems. What these problems have in common is they are all data driven.  We say It’s All Analytics, because the beneft of analytics is that you can  specify what type analytics – e.g., predictive analytics – based on the objec- tive of the method. Or, you can specify sports analytics, for example, to  describe a particular area of application. Furthermore, the term “advanced  analytics” applies to a broad class of predictive and prescriptive models that  use AI, machine learning and data science – a superset of all forward-look- ing methods.   In this chapter, we looked at what “data science” is and tried to place it  among all the terms surrounding data analytics. In the next chapter, we will  look at DATA – “big data,” “little data” and “other data.” Data is the essential  ingredient for data analysis, and how to get “good data” is critical to making  good decisions and eventual success.

Chapter 9  Big Data and Bigger  Data, Little Data, Cloud,  and Other Data   Keywords: Hadoop, Spark, Cloud, Big Data, Streaming Data, Messaging  Services, Relational Data, Unstructured Data   In the last chapter, we covered data science. A data scientist cannot work  without data and data is the subject of this chapter. We explore data of all  types, but in particular, we view big data, cloud data and the emerging  importance of streaming, geospatial and event-based messaging data. These  are the essentials of analytics today. And It’s All Analytics!   Please remember   review where data comes from – processes  see     Preamble   Chapter 3 .   Introduction   As the saying goes, data is the new oil! That is true in many ways. Just as  oil is a commodity, data is more so and it is ubiquitous. It can be taken in  its raw form and be turned into something useful. It must be used with care  and purpose or it can cause problems. One of the differences between oil  and data is that oil is a fnite resource and data seems to be limitless  see   203    204  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Marr, 2018 . Others including The Economist have said, “The world’s most  valuable resource is no longer oil, but data.”   It is All Analytics! And, you cannot do any form of analytics without   data. Even if that data is based on subjective knowledge, which we discuss  at the end of this chapter  also see “Bayesian Statistics” in Chapter 10 and  “Simulation, Sensitivity and Scenario Analysis” in Chapter 11 .   Big data was the rage for several years and we will explore the reasons   behind this and the forms of big data. We will also discuss recent moves  away from some on-premise big data structures to offsite data held in the  cloud. We will demonstrate the value of small data and note that it is not  going away any time soon.   We will provide some context for different data forms – structured, unstruc-  tured and semi-structured. We will discuss two forms of data that are receiv- ing much more attention these days – “streaming data” and “event messaging    data.” The popularity of analytics is driving much of the growth in these areas.   Three Popular Forms and Two Divisions of Data   If we categorize data as it is used in practical ways in analytics, we normally  encounter it in one of three forms – structured, unstructured or semi-struc- tured. We provide some quick defnitions in the next three paragraphs.      If you think of columns and rows in a spreadsheet or a relational data- base, you are thinking of structured data. Structured data is highly orga- nized, indexed and amenable to computer languages  e.g. Structured Query  Language  SQL  . There are dozens of commercial and open source data- bases that support the creation and use of SQL databases and tables. When  creating a database the creator defnes the relationships, data types, and  form of the database. When working within relational databases users can  input, search and manipulate structured data relatively quickly. This is the  most attractive feature of structured data.   Unstructured data, you guessed it, does not have a defned structure.    Unlike the creation of a relational database where the creator defnes the  relationships, data types and forms, in unstructured the data is freeform.    The most common form of unstructured data is text. Other examples  include video, audio, images and generally analog data in any form. It  is estimated that text alone  structured and semi-structured  accounts for  75–80% of the entire world’s data  see Miner et al., 2012 . This number may  well continue to rise with the prominence of the Internet of Things  IoT .       Big, Bigger, Little, Cloud, and Other Data  ◾  205           Semi-structured data is a form of structured data that does not obey  the formal structure of data models associated with relational databases or  other forms of data tables, but nonetheless contains tags or other markers  to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records and felds  within the data  see Buneman, 1997 . Semi-structured data does not have  the same level of organization and predictability of structured data. The data  does not reside in fxed felds or records but does contain elements that can  separate the data into various hierarchies. Most people are familiar with  CSV fles that can be imported into databases and spreadsheets. They pro- vide a minimal structure to the data. XML is a format that has been around  for twenty years, but its use has really taken off in the last fve to ten years.  JSON  JavaScript Object Notation  is one of the most popular forms of semi- structured data today.      Last, in this section, we discuss qualitative data and quantitative data   also see Chapter 4, where we discussed the four scales of measurement  and data formats . Qualitative data are observed, but generally cannot be  measured with a numerical result. Examples might be color, breed of dog,    state of residence and phone brand. Quantitative data can be measured  on numeric scales such as the number of readmissions per year, per mem- ber per month  PMPM  insurance rates, Gross Domestic Product  GDP  and  revenue per year.      What Is Big Data?   There are various reports of who offcially coined the term “Big Data” and of  where it actually started. Part of the confusion revolves around the question,  “Is Big Data a descriptive term or a technology?” We cover both in this sec- tion. We like the following as a descriptive term:   Big Data – a massive volume of data that is so large it is diffcult to   process using traditional technology  as of about 2005 . In most enterprise  scenarios the volume of data is too big or it moves too fast or it exceeds cur- rent processing capacity.   From a technology basis, the following are some  there are others  of the   technologies created to support big data:   ◾  Data Lakes    ◾  High-Performance Relational Database Technologies  Massive Parallel     Processing  MPP      ◾  Hadoop, HDFS, and MapReduce  see following gray box, “Quick Note     206  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     on Apache, Hadoop and Spark”    ◾  Data Hubs    ◾  Cloud Data Warehouses    ◾  Data Virtualization  DV      These technologies are sometimes defned as big data, but they support big  data rather than describing what big data is. Additionally, the description of  big data may include the 3 V’s or 5 V’s. Initially, there were three:          1  Data Volume – the sheer amount of data  2  Data Variety – disparate types, different structures, and formats of data  3  Data Velocity – how fast data is being added to systems, refreshed          Then two more qualities were added to make it the 5 V’s of Big Data.        4  Value – What is the return on investment for sourcing this data?  5  Veracity – What is the quality, reliability, and trustworthiness of the data?        QUICK NOTE ON APACHE, HADOOP AND SPARK   The Apache Software Foundation  www.apache.org  was incorporated in    1999 as an American nonproft corporation. Our focus on the foundation in    this section has to do with big data systems that support scalable in-data- base and in-cluster processing of big data – Hadoop and Spark as examples.  Hadoop was initially released in 2006 and was widely adopted  with  its commercial derivatives  by 2012. According to the Apache Foundation   http:  hadoop.apache.org  :     The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for  the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of com- puters using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up  from  single  servers  to  thousands  of  machines,  each  offering  local  computation and storage.   It offers a software framework for distributed storage  HDFS, Hadoop  Distributed File System  and processing of big data using the MapReduce   a parallel, distributed algorithm  programming model.    Big, Bigger, Little, Cloud, and Other Data  ◾  207           Spark was initially released in May of 2014. It was developed by the  University of California, Berkeley’s AMPLab and was later donated to the  Apache Software Foundation. Spark and its resilient distributed dataset   RDD  were developed in response to limitations in the MapReduce clus- ter computing paradigm  e.g., Hadoop . Spark’s advantages over Hadoop  are  speed  and  performance.  The  main  way  it  accomplishes  this  is  by  using its in-memory data processing. In-memory data processing means  slower disk access is eliminated and replaced by random access memory   RAM   or  fash  memory.  This  is  more  expensive,  but  according  to  the  Apache website, it can run up to 100 times faster  see http:  spark.apache.  org  for logistic regression in Spark vs Hadoop .   Why the Push to Big Data? Why Is Big  Data Technology Attractive?   The technologies of big data came about to support the massive collection  and lengthening of processing time when dealing with these huge volumes  of data. Users needed to access the data, and analyze and model the data  more expediently. From an analytics and data science perspective, there was  a major technology and practice shift when adopting Big Data technology.  Traditionally, most analysis and machine learning involved moving data from  large data repositories  and most of these distributed  into a single “sand- box” for analytics. This involved increasingly more time as the volume of the  data increased; it was taking more and more time to move the data across  the wire. It also was a security risk since you were moving this data across a  network, thus making it easier for someone to tap into sensitive data.   You were also creating a duplicate copy of all this data on another server  or servers, which increased costs and added additional security risks. What  if you could instead move the algorithms  machine learning and other  to  where the data lives in the frst place? Move the algorithms instead of the  data? This was the brilliance of big data technology. We will call this in- cluster, in-database or in-memory machine learning for short. A cluster refers  to a group of servers that are grouped together to work on the same com- putational set of problems and can be viewed as one computer resource.  Our examples will focus on Hadoop and Spark, two open source technolo- gies available as part of the Apache  see gray box on “Apache, Hadoop, and    208  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Spark”  scalable in-database and in-cluster processing. For in-cluster, in- database computing, we are referring to moving the algorithms to the clus- ter where the data lives  Disk, Hadoop HDFS, and MapReduce . In-memory  computing refers to moving the algorithms to faster, volatile RAM, which is  much faster  Spark .   We address near-memory computing in the “Other Important Data   Focuses of Today and Tomorrow” section of this chapter.   The Hype of Big Data   For many years “big data” was the rage, it was a major hype cycle  see gray  box, “Big Data and the Gartner Hype Cycle” . You will still hear the term,  but it is now considered part of the landscape and not the technology that  will ever “change the world,” as it once was. In machine learning, it is still  important to qualify the difference in technology as to where the models  are trained. Are you moving data from a database into an analytic system or  moving the code   algorithms to the data?   BIG DATA AND THE GARTNER HYPE CYCLE   We have mentioned Gartner several times. Gartner Inc. is a global research  and advisory frm providing information, advice, and tools for businesses  in IT, fnance, HR, customer service and support, legal and compliance,  marketing, sales, and supply chain functions  see www.gartner.com . It is  a member of the S&P 500. According to Gartner’s Website:   Gartner Hype Cycles provide a graphic representation of the matu- rity and adoption of technologies and applications, and how they are  potentially relevant to solving real business problems and exploiting  new  opportunities.  Gartner  Hype  Cycle  methodology  gives  you  a  view of how a technology or application will evolve over time, pro- viding a sound source of insight to manage its deployment within  the context of your specifc business goals.   There are 5 phases of the Hype Cycle:   Each Hype Cycle drills down into the fve key phases of a technol- ogy’s life cycle:    Big, Bigger, Little, Cloud, and Other Data  ◾  209           Innovation Trigger: A potential technology breakthrough kicks things  off. Early proof-of-concept stories and media interest trigger signifcant  publicity. Often no usable products exist and commercial viability is  unproven.   Peak of Infated Expectations: Early publicity produces a number of  success stories — often accompanied by scores of failures. Some com- panies take action; many do not.   Trough of Disillusionment: Interest wanes as experiments and imple- mentations  fail  to  deliver.  Producers  of  the  technology  shake  out  or  fail. Investments continue only if the surviving providers improve their  products to the satisfaction of early adopters.   Slope of Enlightenment: More instances of how the technology can  beneft  the  enterprise  start  to  crystallize  and  become  more  widely  understood. Second- and third-generation products appear from tech- nology  providers.  More  enterprises  fund  pilots;  conservative  compa- nies remain cautious.   Plateau of Productivity: Mainstream adoption starts to take off. Criteria  for assessing provider viability are more clearly defned. The technol- ogy’s broad market applicability and relevance are clearly paying off.   A hype cycle graph would look like the following with expectations  in the y-axis and the fve key phases would be along the bottom  see  Figure 9.1 . Each technology would appear somewhere on the continuum  and labeled as to when the technology would reach the phase of “Plateau  of Productivity.” Here we have provided one technology  normally there  would be a few dozen  for Big Data. This approximates where Big Data  was in 2014.   It is interesting to note that Big Data dropped off the hype cycle early –    in 2015. In 2014 it had been listed as “Peak of Infated Expectations”  see    Woodie, August 2015  – “as big data-mania set in, the technology was near    the ‘Peak of Infated Expectations.’ A year later, as the shine started wear- ing off, big data started slipping down into the ‘Trough of Disillusionment.’”    It would have been expected to be near the bottom of the trough in 2015,    but instead, it was totally absent. “I would not consider big data to be an    emerging  technology,”  Betsy  Burton   Gartner  Analyst   said:  “This  hype    cycle is very focused. I look at emerging trends.” So in 2015 Big Data had    lost its emerging technology status and was considered mainstream.    210  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Figure 9.1  Example of Gartner Hype Cycle with Big Data Location in 2014.      To look at the pressure on CEOs and CIOs to adopt Hadoop and Big   Data we can see what views were being expressed in late 2011. Dan Woods,  in Forbes  see Woods, 2011 , explains how to pitch the pros and cons to the  CEOs. Big Data was all the rage and organizations had a real fear of missing  out; letting competitors leapfrog them with the mysterious wonders of big  data that would revolutionize business models – or so went the hype! Big  data technology was hot!   Pivotal Changes in Big Data Technology   We should note that in the last year, we have witnessed some major changes    in big data technologies, particularly Hadoop and commercial vendors sup- porting Hadoop-based infrastructures. We have talked with colleagues that are    shutting down their open source Hadoop clusters  and commercial analogs     and opting for cloud and other technologies. We do not think this is the end    of Hadoop as many companies have realized the value of their investment.    However, it has meant the shuttering or downsizing of commercial provid- ers, and some companies that had not realized the value of their investment      are making sharp pivots into cloud and hybrid cloud  see Park, July 2019, for  names, trends, and consolidations . We have seen other writers and bloggers    offer the same sentiments. See Sivalingam  July 2019  for his perspective on    whether the death in question is that of Hadoop or of Big Data.    Big, Bigger, Little, Cloud, and Other Data  ◾  211           Brief Notes on Cloud   Cloud technologies have been growing rapidly and this growth is expected  to not only continue but accelerate. In fact, Gartner predicts the worldwide  public cloud service market will grow from US$182.4B in 2018 to US$331.2B  in 2022, attaining a compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of 12.6%  see  Columbus, April 2019 . There are various aspects discussed in this report,  but the point is that cloud is huge and getting bigger. Another point made is  that when it comes to data storage, cloud is shifting storage from inside the  data center, i.e. on-premise, to hosted services.   Options to store data in the cloud are diverse and support all the vari- ous types of data we discuss in this chapter – structured and relational,  semi-structured and non-structured and even streaming data which will be  discussed soon. All of these options are supported in cloud repositories, so  virtually any analytics application consuming data can keep their data in the  cloud.   So why are people moving data to the cloud? Here are just a few   examples:                     2  Scalability – Your enterprise can scale up or scale down your opera-    1  Cost Savings – There are no hardware investments with cloud. You  can normally expense rather than capitalize these costs. No long-term  commitments required, except human capital to change strategies.  Service costs are offset by fewer highly specialized personnel.    tion and storage needs quickly to suit your situation, allowing fexibility  as your needs change.    3  Business Continuity – Specialized human resources are taken care of  by the cloud provider so losing a key data base administrator or similar  role is not the issue it can be with owning all aspects of the data center.    guarantee that data is securely stored and handled.    locations can easily access all the could services. All they need is an  Internet connectivity.    6  High Reliability – Cloud environments are distributed across the  globe and have near 100% availability. The cloud provider handles  disaster recovery, backups and more. However, you must consider your  network and Internet connectivity  see 1 drawback of cloud .   5  Mobility – Employees who are working on the premises or at remote   4  Data Security – Cloud offers many advanced security features that          212  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     It would be unfair not to mention a few of the drawbacks with cloud:                  3  Control – Since the cloud infrastructure is entirely owned, managed   2  Security – While cloud offers some security advantages, it opens up   1  Requires Connectivity – This is a big one.

If  you have technical issues, you can be at the mercy of the provider.    is running. Also, you may be charged for data movement and other  fees. Companies that do not manage these services can be surprised by  expenses.    5  Vendor Lock – of course, this can happen with any IT product or ser- vice, but it should be considered up front. If you move everything to a  specifc cloud provider, there is a lot of inertia and it takes a lot of effort  to move to another vendor.   4  Unexpected Charges – If  virtual  machines are left running the meter      CHIEF DATA OFFICER  CDO  – IMPORTANCE OF THIS   NEW ROLE IN DATA SCIENCE   DATA ANALYTICS:   Many today see the role of CDO as mainly defensive, ensuring compli- ance with regulations. However, many see that in the future the CDO  will drive innovation and “data culture,” as evidenced by the references   statements below:   Is innovation with data the future role of the CDO?   Chief Data Offcers will be expected to step up to lead the data inno- vation charge. A majority of frms report having appointed a Chief  Data  Offcer   55.9% .  While  56%  see  the  role  as  largely  defensive  and reactive in scope today – driven by regulatory and compliance  requirements – 48.3% believe that the primary role of the Chief Data  Offcer should be to drive innovation and establish a data culture,  and 41.4% indicate that the role of the CDO should be to manage  and leverage data as an enterprise business asset. Only 6.9% suggest  that regulatory compliance should be the focus of the CDO.    New Vantage Partners, 2017     Big, Bigger, Little, Cloud, and Other Data  ◾  213           WHY DO YOU NEED A CDO?   In  order  for  businesses  to  become  data-driven,  they  need  to    empower their CDO to ensure quality information that can be used  in  a  meaningful  way  throughout  the  organization.  Empowering  Chief Data Offcers ultimately leads to a successful business. Why?  Data comes in high volume and variety.       Experian, 2019    What is the difference between CIO and CDO?   Clear  reporting  lines  are  also  critical.  Depending  on  the  sector  a  CDO can implement digital transformation which can free a CIO’s    time to focus on operating IT. The CDO’s responsibility is to experi- ment with new business tools and develop digital skills across the  workforce. Typically the CDO would report to the CIO.    Dobinson and Williams, 2019    “Not Big Data” Is Alive and Well and  Lessons from the Swamp   While much of the hype and focus was on “Big Data,” “Not Big Data” was hav-   ing a huge impact on organizations. It was allowing for better decision-making,    and it allowed for action across a huge set of business problems. It provided  useful machine learning, data science, statistics and business intelligence  BI .   In fact, most analytics problems are not solved with Big Data   technology!! Big Data technology was just a very hyped, built-up marketec- ture that sold many hours of consulting and licenses of software. We are not  saying that all dollars spent on big data were wasted. Defnitely not. There  are many, many examples of valuable, successful implementations of Big  Data and they continue today and will tomorrow. What we want to again  point out, is watch out for the hype cycle. Here are a few pointers:         1  Be wary of white papers, posts, and blogs on technology that will rapidly  change the world. Who why is this person writing this? The writer may  be correct. They may be early or late. They may have an immediate  bias. Think critically about the credentials and intent of the writer.    214  ◾        It’s All Analytics!              2  While certainly not perfect in their predictions or opinions, we have     mentioned Gartner several times. It would be good to check what some  of these analysts are saying. No one is completely unbiased, but they  are more objective than many other sources. Gartner, Forrester, Dresner  are our top three, but there are many more out there with different  methodologies. Some rely directly on customer feedback, others on the  wisdom of the crowd, others on analyst expert opinion.      3  The crowd can be wrong. If you look back in history, and big data is      a great example, you will see hyper hype – like the hype around big  data. Big data was real; big data was and will continue to be impor- tant. However, people that skipped the hiring of a bunch of data    scientists and data engineers and spending millions on Hadoop and    commercial clusters, but instead went straight to the cloud, saved a lot    of money. There are good reasons for recessions like the dot com bust    and the fnancial crisis – fear of missing out! Look for the value, be    realistic.      4  Experiment, rather than diving in. One of the tenets of any technology      solution is: “Is it scalable?” Meaning as my enterprise grows larger or  into new geographies or markets, will my solution easily expand to sup- port it? Therefore, scalability should be a requirement and you should  be easily able to do a pilot project to test out the results. For Hadoop,  many customers were creating data lakes by throwing in every piece  of data. What should we put in our lake, how should we tag or label  it – “just throw it all in, all history as well as everything coming in, we  will fgure out how to structure and use it later, we will use this data  someday!” They now have stagnant data that cannot be used for analyt- ics without huge effort – these lakes have become data swamps! What if  they had started with a pilot with specifc measurable objectives, a time- line to meet these objectives, a phase II for expansion if they reached  success or a termination plan if they failed?   Data is valuable everywhere it is meaningfully applied to real problems,  i.e., where good analytics are performed. We need big data, small data and  everything in between. However, the view “just throw it all in and we will  use it someday” is a losing proposition. This “throw it all in” applies in data  warehousing as well as data lakes. One more time – if data is not used it is  just a cost and of no value. It costs money to store it, secure it and back it    Big, Bigger, Little, Cloud, and Other Data  ◾  215           up and this becomes a liability. To paraphrase Ben Franklin – “an ounce of  planning is worth a pound of success.”   Many business processes do not generate large volumes of data. Not every     problem is a big data problem. In our experience, large volumes of data are    not required to provide signifcant value. We will see in the next chapter that    many statistical methods do not require large volumes to provide insight.   A Brief Note on Subjective and Synthetic Data     We have been talking about data that is stored in a repository or database.    However, there are powerful analytic methods that do not require tables or  spreadsheets of tables. We will call this subjective data, meaning data that      lives in our heads, based on our experience and our past observations. There    are many uses of subjective data. We mention four methods of working with  subjective data at this point, and will elaborate more in upcoming chapters:                    1  Bayesian Statistics – We will dive into Bayesian statistics in the next  chapter. Simply put, Bayesian statistics combines subjective knowledge  of a researcher or data scientist  prior knowledge  with data observed   e.g., database, etc.  to formulate probabilities of events  posterior  knowledge  happening in the future.    2  Simulation – Based on our subjective knowledge of a process or phe- nomenon we can generate computer-based models via computer code  to formulate and augment our intelligence. No formal data is required;  instead, it is generated synthesized from a statistical or mathematical  model. We will talk more about this in Chapter 11.    3  Mathematical Programming – The rich disciplines of computer sci- ence, management science, operations research and engineering often  use mathematical programming, linear programming  LP  or optimiza- tion procedures. These techniques are formulated without databases  or tables. Instead, an objective and some constraints are specifed and  input into an LP model and then data is run against the framework. We  will talk more about this in Chapter 11.  4  Sensitivity or Scenario Analysis – This is really a subset of simu-   lation. Due to its wide use and relationship to other analytic model  results, we mention it separately. Sensitivity analysis is a process of       216  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     varying input parameters of a model  maybe a subjective model  within  an allowed area and observing the resulting changes in the model  solution.   Other Important Data Focuses of Today and Tomorrow   We briefy mention some technologies that are shaping the data and com- puting landscape today and will play a prominent role in the future. These  are not necessarily new in concept or practice, but they will be playing an  important role in analytics of all types:                      1  Data Virtualization  DV   2  Streaming Data  3  Events  Event-Driven or Event Data   4  Geospatial  5  IoT  6  High-Performance In-Memory Computing Beyond Spark  7  Grid and GPU  Graphics Processing Unit  Computing  8  Near-Memory Computing  9  Data Fabric                         Data Virtualization  DV    DV was created not to supplant the data warehouse, but to extend the reach  and capabilities of the data warehouse. By virtualization, there is no physical  recreation or copying of data. An apt, concise defnition on which we agree  was provided by techopedia:   Data virtualization is the process of aggregating data from different  sources of information to develop a single, logical and virtual view  of information so that it can be accessed by front-end solutions  such as applications, dashboards, and portals without having to  know the data’s exact storage location  https:  techopedia.com de    fnition 1007 data-virtualization .                                 We would add that there are several other desirable characteristics for DV –  we mention two key ones here. The frst revolves around improved security.  With DV you are not moving data so it is less likely to be compromised. You    Big, Bigger, Little, Cloud, and Other Data  ◾  217           also have an added security permissions layer for role-based or user-based  security that allows for both column- and row-level access that is easily  governed outside the database. You also have a business-centric metadata  repository or catalog where users can search, collaborate and understand the  enterprise data.   Streaming Data   Streaming data to a consumer might mean streaming services that provide  content such as iTunes, Netfix, Hulu or any other of the many stream- ing services available. Here is a simple useful example: a device, Roku  Streaming Stick, Google Chromecast or Amazon Fire TV Stick connects to  a server via the Internet. The server responds to a request and provides a  continuous transmission of audio to these “client” devices and loads their  “cache” or memory over a period of time, pausing when the cache is full,  but providing the data in real time, until the request has been completed.  This is not a new technology, but the technology is constantly improv-  ing and moreover, the application of the technology is spreading at a faster  and faster pace with IoT  see below , with telemetry, video, and sensors  tapping into more and more real-time data. The promise of 5G technology  will connect the world in new and amazing ways. The application of analyt- ics to this technology is crucial. Streaming data enables what Gartner calls  “Continuous Intelligence”  see Gartner Press Release, February 2019 .   Events  Event-Driven or Event Data    While event-driven data can be streaming or real time, it is not required. Life  is full of events and we can qualify and quantity data around these events.  John Spacey very simply and clearly provides 12 examples of event data.  These event data are things like analytics, e-commerce, home automation,  infrastructure, transport, IT, business processes, AI, complex event process- ing  CEP  and more  see Spacey, 2018 . Event-driven technology has been  around for many years and is very useful in BI and business activity moni- toring  BAM, see Chapter 5 . However, it is receiving more attention these  days because data science and machine learning are expanding the reach  and value of traditional BI and BAM. Instead of using simple rules or alerts  in event messaging, we can now place machine learning predictive and pre- scriptive models at the point of decision-making or action taking via event  messaging.    218  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Geospatial   With technology in smart phones and smart apps, geospatial applications  have really taken off and will continue to fourish. Traditional maps are a  thing of the distant past as consumers use apps of every sort. Transportation  and logistics companies are building intelligence in all their geospatial sys- tems. The granularity specifcity is amazing these days. For shoppers that  elect to opt in, retailers can follow their movement inside stores and pro- vide location-specifc offers to their customers at the right time. Geographic  Information Systems  GIS  are streamlining supply chain management,  reducing crime, improving economic development and more by embedding  AI and machine learning models inside them.   IoT  Internet of Things    Technology is enabling a more widespread adoption of IoT, from pill- shaped micro-cameras that can pinpoint thousands of images within the  body, to smart sensors that can assess crop conditions on a farm, to the  smart home devices that are becoming increasingly popular. We have  already discussed IoT in several chapters and it is not an independent  technology or methodology. For example, take Smart Cities, which use the  concept of interconnecting cameras and sensors and sources of previously  stored data that can be integrated and acted upon with a variety of analyt- ics. We just mentioned streaming data, which is an important technology  that enables IoT; additionally, event-driven messaging goes hand-in-hand  with IoT. IoT has had a big impact on the way we live today, and similar  impacts will be accelerated in the coming years. Please see gray box, “New  Stanford IoT Hospital,” for how Stanford is using IoT-based technologies  to create a hospital of the future.  reference: https:  online.stanford.edu co    urses xee100-introduction-internet-things .

The hospital includes a variety of new technolo- gies from patient-centric controls in rooms to modular architecture, to a    Big, Bigger, Little, Cloud, and Other Data  ◾  219           robotic pharmacy and IoT-based technology. According to the Wall Street  Journal  see Rosenbush, November 2019    Sensors will track the location of staff and equipment in real time,  improving effciency and inventory control. The infrastructure can  support  120,000  connected  devices  streaming  4K  high-defnition  video.  The  infrastructure  will  be  able  to  accommodate  upgrades  such  as  5G  wireless.  Magnetic  resonance  imaging  equipment  and  other systems will be integrated with one another in new ways.   Doctors and nurses will be able to monitor multiple patients from a  single remote location. Alerts and alarms will go directly to secure  mobile  devices  carried  by  nurses  and  doctors,  instead  of  sound- ing at nursing stations—reducing noise levels… [What’s Next]… Two    patient rooms will test a bedside computer-vision system that uses  depth and thermal sensors to improve patient safety.   High-Performance In-Memory Computing Beyond Spark   There are commercial platforms and technologies that extend beyond Spark.  These are extremely powerful in-memory databases. Most are based on  Apache Spark and related Apache platforms and are completely compatible  with Apache open source. However, they outperform Spark on benchmark  tests by optimizing the architecture and database throughput, and at the  same time offer low latency and high concurrency.   Grid and GPU Computing   While grid computing originated in the 1990s it is important to mention so  readers are aware of its continuing relevance to AI and machine learning.    Grid incorporates widely distributed computer resources to solve complex  problems. Each node in the grid is set to perform a different task. A GPU    is a chip  semiconductor package  specifcally designed to perform rapid    mathematical calculations, primarily for the purpose of rendering images.  However, they are often used in grid computing, AI and computationally  intensive methods because the chips are relatively cheap due to their ubiq- uitous application in graphics cards, smart phones and elsewhere.    220  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Near-Memory Computing   We spoke about two paradigms in this chapter for machine learning and AI  modeling:         a   the conventional approach of moving stored data to the CPU for com- putation  slow and a performance bottleneck for emerging scale-out  data-intensive applications  and      b   in-memory computing, where we move the algorithms into fast, volatile,      fash or RAM memory.   The next generation in the acceleration of computational speed is near-  memory computing  NMC , which couples compute units close to the mem- ory  see Singh et al., November 2019; Singh, August 2018 . Memory-centric  chip technologies are emerging that help solve bandwidth issues. Essentially  the idea is to bring the memory closer to the processing tasks to speed up  the system  see Lapedus, 2019 .   Data Fabric   In the last couple of years, there has been a lot of buzz about data fabrics.  In February 2019, Gartner noted “Data fabric” as one of the data and analyt- ics technology trends  see Gartner Press Release, February 2019 :   Data fabric enables frictionless access and sharing of data in a dis- tributed data environment. It enables a single and consistent data  management framework, which allows seamless data access and  processing by design across otherwise siloed storage.   Through 2022, bespoke data fabric designs will be deployed pri- marily as a static infrastructure, forcing organizations into a new  wave of cost to completely re-design for more dynamic data mesh  approaches.    Gartner, 2019    It will be very interesting to see how data fabric technology plays out and  fts in with existing technology such as data virtualization.    Big, Bigger, Little, Cloud, and Other Data  ◾  221           Future Careers in Data   Careers in data engineering and data management have been bright for  many years and will only get brighter. We are generating data at a diz- zying pace and this is accelerating with no end in sight. Technologies  to capture data are expanding – especially video, audio, streaming, sen- sors, telemetry and IoT. IDC predicts that the global datasphere will  grow from 33 zettabytes in 2018 to 175 zettabytes by 2025  a zettabyte is  1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes, 1 billion terabytes . If one person    downloaded this amount of data at 25 megabytes per second  average speed  in the United States today  it would take 1.8 billion years to download it. If  everyone on the planet joined in 24 hours a day it would still take 81 days.  See Figure 9.2   We have covered many data concepts and illustrated many technologies  in this book, but will dive more in depth in our upcoming book, Designing    an Integrated AI, Analytics, and Data Science Architecture for Your  Organization  see Burk and Miner, 2021 . You can count on data access  getting faster; data will continue to get bigger. Many of the challenges that  have persisted for years remain today because the data is always changing.  As data volumes grow, the data variety expands; data velocity increases and  existing technology cannot handle it. Technology must respond and adapt to   Figure 9.2  Annual size of global data  adapted from Reinsel et al, Data Age 2025;  The Digitization of the World  IDC November 2018  .       222  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     these changes. The search for the “single version of the truth” is an ever- present reason for new concepts and solutions. Technology will continue to  enable all growth. Data sourcing via APIs  application programming inter- faces  will continue to grow and diversify, creating larger volumes. Network  speeds and 5G will increase velocity; cloud and cloud-related technologies  will expand data variety. The use of analytics is the only way to prove the  value of data, otherwise, collecting data is just a cost.   Postscript   We have covered many data-related concepts and technologies in this chap- ter. We have provided information on Big Data to Small Data, from struc- tured to unstructured, from old data technologies to new ones. Data has  replaced oil as the most valuable resource, that is – if we use it, to  do that – It’s All Analytics!   In the next chapter, we will cover statistics, a much feared subject, and one    that is often very misunderstood. However, it is a very important subject for all    forms of analytics. We will also cover prescriptive analytics and causal models.   References   Buneman, Peter.

We now move to a  commonly misunderstood subject, statistics. We will cover various forms and  put statistics in context with analytics, data science, machine learning, and  AI. A data scientist should be well versed in statistics, as we will see that  statistics is the foundation for virtually all forms of analytics. We then follow  with bridges between predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics, and one  of these bridges is statistics.   This chapter will be a bit eclectic since statistics is so broad and we want    to tie statistics to the subjects we presented. Therefore, we thought we would    provide a brief layout of this chapter, which has these fve main pillars:   ◾  Some Statistical Foundations  related to analytics, what you should know     ◾  Predictive Analytics vs Prescriptive Analytics – The Missing Link Is     Causation   ◾  Assuming or Establishing Causation    ◾  Ladder of Causation    ◾  Predicting an Increasing New Trend – Structural Causal Models and     Causal Inference   225    226  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Some Statistical Foundations   Introduction      The subject of statistics throws many people off. Some may even con- fuse statistics with sadistics. However, at its core, statistics is very simple.  Statistics are characteristics  average, minimum, maximum, etc.  of    samples. Parameters are characteristics  average, minimum, maximum,  etc.  of populations and populations are NOT just current or historical.  Processes can produce population observations that can project into the  future  we spoke in depth about processes in Chapter 3, see the sections  “Processes Are Everywhere” and “Processes Drive Data” . Samples are sub- sets of populations. Populations are defned as the collection of objects  under study  patients, widgets, voters, etc. . We want to learn describe popu- lations or make decisions judgments about a population process and we do    this by estimating parameters with statistics via a sample. That’s it! That is  statistics.   Therefore the whole idea of creating training, testing and validation sets  for machine learning and AI involves sampling, and we calculate statistics  from these samples – therefore you cannot do machine learning or AI  without the concepts of sampling and statistics. This is using statistics  at a very primary level.   The following fgure  Figure 10.1  illustrates an example of simple ran- dom sampling  SRS . The goal of SRS is to derive a representative subset     Figure 10.1     Illustration of SRS  Simple Random Sampling .    Stats, Causation, Prescriptive Analytics  ◾  227           of a population. The population is on the left and every element of the    population has an equal chance of being drawn into the sample. If done    correctly the elements of interest in the sample will be a mirror of the    population, but just a smaller number. There are 12 elements in the popu- lation, 4 in the sample. This illustrates that virtually all analytics uses    statistics.   Let us look at the statistical subjects we want you to know at a high level,   and then we will jump in:                             1  Two Major Divisions of Statistics – Descriptive Statistics and Inferential     Statistics  2  What Made Statistics Famous?    3  Two Major Paradigms of Statistics    4  Dividing It Up – Assumption Heavy and Assumption Light Statistics      5  Four Domains in Statistics to Mention  a.

Time Series TS          6  An Ever-Important Reminder  7  Statistics Summary  8  Comparison of Data-Driven Paradigms Thus Far            Two Major Divisions of Statistics – Descriptive  Statistics and Inferential Statistics   Descriptive Statistics is a branch of statistics concerned with describ- ing characteristics of the population under study. Thus, descriptive statistics  supports and is part of analytics. These characteristics   descriptive statistics  are retrospective in nature. Most people are familiar with averages, mini- mums, maximums, etc., which people refer to as “statistics.” However, these  are not the only ones. There are thousands of various statistics that can be  calculated. Business intelligence  BI  is primarily focused on description  and retrospection – therefore descriptive statistics is at the heart of BI.  Remember, a statistic is ANY characteristic of a sample – they may be useful  or un-useful. Good statistics are useful. No assumptions have to be made  using descriptive statistics. When the data scientist applies machine  learning and AI, which uses algorithms in training samples to build models,  they are using descriptive statistics.    228  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Inferential Statistics is a type of statistics that focuses on drawing     conclusions about the population, based on sample analysis. This conclu- sion about the population may extend beyond the data currently available,    meaning processes drive  future  data such that the entire population is    not currently available to sample. Inferential statistics typically requires    assumptions. For example, we assume the parent population from which    we are drawing a sample has a “bell shape”  a distribution, a model . This    has benefts and drawbacks as we will we see. However, one beneft typi-   cally cited for machine learning and AI is that these methods are “model  free” or “distribution free,” meaning we do not need to assume something    like the “bell shape” just mentioned. This frees the data scientist from    worrying about testing assumptions or making an incorrect assumption.    Quick note: statistics also come in “model free” forms, they just are not as    well known to the general public  we will get to that later in this chapter    in the section on “Non-parametric distribution free statistics  assumption    light ” .   What Made Statistics Famous?   There are several things that made statistics famous; we share two of the  most well-known and describe them briefy.   ◾  Criminal Trials and Hypothesis Testing    ◾  The Scientifc Method     Criminal Trials and Hypothesis Testing   Statistical hypothesis testing  a form of statistical inference  is intuitive.  Criminal jury trials and statistical hypothesis testing have a lot in  common. Here is an analogy – the prosecution  a researcher  based on  preliminary observation and evidence  observation or exploratory data  analysis  believes a defendant  process  is guilty  a causal effect, A causes  B . The court will assume the defendant is innocent  A does not cause B .  They present accumulated evidence  data from a representative sample   to the jury  hypothesis test . The jury  hypothesis test  decides if there is  enough evidence  suffcient statistical evidence  to reject the presumption of  innocence  A does not cause B . If there is enough evidence, the jury rejects  the assumption of innocence and concludes that the defendant is guilty  A  causes B .    Stats, Causation, Prescriptive Analytics  ◾  229           There are many references to this relationship; we provide a link to a   discussion with a 2×2 decision table in the “Resources for the Avid Learner”  section. Also see the references  Liu and Stone, 2006; Davis and Mukamal,  2006; Devine, 2012 .   NOTE: You may have heard of “statistically signifcant.” Statistical   signifcance equates to the evidence needed to fnd someone guilty in the  court trial. A hypothesis test is a method of statistical inference.   The other issue where society sends innocent people to prison needs to  be considered; this is analogous to the researcher thinking that A causes B  when in fact it does not. This is a “false discovery rate” and there is no way  around it. The more you want to send more guilty people to jail, the less  evidence you require to convict and the more often you will send someone  innocent to jail. The converse is also true, of course. Statisticians control this  type of error with the “level of signifcance.” For criminal cases, and medical  life-and-death issues, we need carefully consider the “level of signifcance.”  The reason there is no way around this “false discovery rate” is that “you   can’t prove a negative.” An interesting read on this is the “Black Swan  Problem”  see “Resources for the Avid Learner” section for a reference .  However, the short story goes that for a long time it was believed that black  swans did not exist. Only white swans had ever been seen according to  historical records. Seeing only white swans seemed to prove that only white  swans existed. Until of course one day, someone saw black swans in South  Central Australia, thus, disproving that only white swans existed.  And your  second author, Gary, has been to the preserve in South Central Australia  and seen these black swans with his own eyes, so YES it is TRUE; and in  fact now he even has friends in the United States who raise these Black  Swans!!! .   NOTE: Statistics is about quantifying uncertainty. It is not about   eliminating uncertainty. It is not about making decisions that  are 100% accurate and 100% precise. That is impossible with any  methodology.   The Scientifc Method   The scientifc method is taught early in school, often in U.S. elementary  schools. A logical methodical process teaches at any age a practical way to  look at the world, formulate ideas about the mechanism that causes results  and ways to test these ideas. The scientifc method is about observations,  formulating intelligent hypotheses. Nevertheless, how can you confrm      230  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     deny that your thoughts are accurate? You can use statistics to help. If we  want to be very precise about this, we can use the following set of statistical  and scientifc research steps:                      4  Construct a statistical experimental design. This does not have to be   1  Ask a question.  2  Do background research.  3  Construct a hypothesis  a hypothesis is an educated assumption – based         on research and observation .    elaborate. However, it needs to be done prior to the experiment. It  should include how you are going to sample  like the number of runs,  how you are going to vary factors . Written hypotheses and a signif- cance level for testing.          hypothesis.   5  Run your experiment as stated in 4.  6  Analyze the results and determine the hypothesis outcome.  7  You can use the results as feedback into 2 above.  8  Communicate results whether they confrm or deny your original   NOTE: Communicating results is important. There has been an asymmetric  reward for publishing based on “success.” We hope the tide is turning and  scientifc journals will publish and reward research that publishes statisti- cally signifcant and non-signifcant results. Both contribute to scientifc  understanding.   TORTURE THE DATA LONG ENOUGH AND   THEY WILL ADMIT TO ANYTHING!   There is a saying among statisticians: “Torture the data long enough and  they  will  admit  to  anything!”  We  covered  this  when  we  talked  about  data dredging in Chapter 6. Since we are in the statistics chapter and we  have introduced statistical inference, we will go a bit deeper into what  we mean by this. Suppose I am working on my Ph.D. in social sciences   criminology  and I have a very large set of data. Suppose I want to fnd  the  major  factors  of  recidivism.  I  can  perform  hundreds  of  hypothesis  tests with different factors. If I fnd one that is signifcant it will provide  the support I need for my thesis dissertation. As stated, I control the false  discovery rate. Uninformed students or students that need to fnish their    Stats, Causation, Prescriptive Analytics  ◾  231           research very rapidly may misapply this rate by not adjusting it for the  hundreds of times they are testing. This is torturing the data. If you sift  through enough data without applying the appropriate correction for the  false discovery rate, you will declare something signifcant when in fact  it is just by chance alone.   STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE VS PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE   Statistically signifcant means that there is a mathematical difference in  the outcome. It does not imply that the outcome is useful. For example,  it is possible to show that a drug is effective in reducing blood pressure,  but if it only drops it by 0.05%, the treatment may not be practically sig- nifcant for the cost of the drug.   Two Major Paradigms of Statistics   “The subject of probability theory is the foundation upon which all of sta- tistics is built, providing a means for modeling populations, experiments  or almost anything else that could be considered a random phenomenon”   Casella and Berger, 2001 . Next, we briefy introduce two paradigms, both  deeply rooted in probability theory.   Bayesian Statistics   Bayesian statistics was formulated upon the Bayes theorem, published    in 1763 authored by Reverend Thomas Bayes, who died prior to it being    published  he lived 1701 to 1761 . It is one of the most important practi- cal mathematical results ever published and can be represented for a    specifc case with a simple formula that can be taught to a high school      mathematics class. Bayes’s solution to a problem of inverse probability  was presented in “An Essay towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine    of Chances,” which was read to the Royal Society in 1763 after Reverend    Bayes’s death.   One great thing about Bayesian results is that when doing inferential   statistics the results are expressed as true probabilities, and in fact, they are  true probabilities. Contrast this to classical statistics  presented in a moment ,    232  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     where we speak in terms of confdence and conditional results of unrealized  sample results. Bayesian statistics also takes into account prior knowledge  of a researcher or practitioner. Bayesians, and many other people, like this  because you are not throwing away any information. Imagine a physicist  who has been experimenting in a lab for 30 years. You would think they  have some knowledge of the underlying process that should be part of an  experiment. Bayesians may combine this knowledge with the data from  actual experiments to formulate results. If they use this prior information, it  is explicitly stated and is represented as a “prior distribution”  just like the  statistical distributions we talked about before . Therefore, they are not hid- ing anything and all assumptions and necessary criteria on how the experi- ment is to be conducted and analyzed are expressed before any data from  the experiment is collected. Classical   frequentist statisticians do not like the  idea of subjective prior information.   There are literally thousands of Bayesian methods that have been devel- oped over the last two hundred years. They are very powerful. One thing  that kept them from becoming more widely used years ago is that, unlike  “closed-form” methods, you have to numerically approximate results, so it  requires a great deal of memory and processing power. However, this is not  the primary limitation. Knowledge is.   Bayesian methods got a big bump in usage in the late 1990s and early   2000s when statisticians like Andrew Gelman at Columbia University popu- larized them, particularly in open source coding libraries  Gelman, 2010 .  They then fell out of vogue for about 10 years and now are back on the rise.  With knowledge comes power.   Classical or Frequentist Statistics   While Bayesian methods have been around for hundreds of years, they were  not used largely due to the computational complexity until recent years.  Therefore, the term “classical statistics” is based on a repeated sampling  paradigm. So, when using “classical statistics” we talk in terms of “frequen- tist methods.” So, while confusing, you may generalize these three terms  – classical statistics, frequentist statistics, repeated sampling paradigm – as  generally the same. Let us take up the motivation for this idea of a repeated  sampling paradigm with an example.   Imagine we want to estimate the outcome of a new school referendum.   All that is needed for this to pass in a balloted vote is a simple major- ity. There are about 100,000 voters. How could a statistician approach this    Stats, Causation, Prescriptive Analytics  ◾  233           problem? They would take a representative sample of likely voters, as it  would be impossible to interview all possible voters. What do we mean by a  representative sample? We would want to be sure that our sample matched  the population, not biasing for ANY factor  age, where they lived, income,  ethnicity, religious preference, children in the home, etc. . See SRS at the  beginning of this chapter.   Suppose we get a representative sample of 1,040 voters. In our sample,   the proportion of people saying they will vote “yes” is 52.0%. Should we  conclude that the proposition will pass? The statistician says we should not  because of something called sampling error. She asks us, is ours the only  representative sample that could have been taken from the population? No.  How many? A very large number! Would these theoretical samples  notice  repeated samples, i.e., repeated sampling paradigm  all generate a propor- tion of 52%? No. If the population had a proportion of 50%, what would  be the range of our sample proportions? With some theory already devel- oped  via calculus , the statistician could plug numbers into a formula and  tell us that if the true population proportion is 50% then you would expect  representative samples  of size 1,040  to generate proportions from 46% to  54%, 99 out of 100 times  frequentist . Therefore, 52% is within the margin  of error, therefore not statistically signifcant. Without being entirely pre- cise we would need our sample proportion to be about 54% or greater to  be extremely confdent the referendum will pass. Note: the problem with  surveys is not the statistical theory, as the math the solid. The real problem  is the diffculty in getting a truly representative sample, especially about a  future event.   Dividing It Up – Assumption Heavy and  Assumption Light Statistics   We spoke previously about the fact that BI, machine learning and AI all  use the statistical paradigm, i.e., they use samples. However, we under- stand when people compare “statistics” to machine learning and AI they are  generally speaking about a very specifc subset of statistics. This subset is  parametric statistics and we will call these assumption heavy statis- tics. We will elaborate on this extensively in this chapter since it is a very  important and very often misunderstood concept. One of the advantages of  machine learning vs parametric statistics is that there are far fewer assump- tions required with machine learning. This may be an advantage. It certainly  simplifes things.    234  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Here we point out some statistics that do not require assumptions  or   have minimal assumptions  in the traditional sense:   1  When using the sampling   statistical methods for machine learning   2  Descriptive statistics  as stated previously, these require no assumptions   3  Distribution free statistics   non-parametric statistics  see following              noted above       section    On the opposite side of these minimal assumption-based statistics, we have  parametric statistics that require an understanding or assumptions of the  shapes or types of the data from the population we are sampling. If we  are correct in these assumptions, parametric statistics will often outperform  machine learning and AI methods  see gray box on “Parametric Statistics  and Where they may Outperform Machine Learning Paradigms” . When  these assumptions are not correct, our results can underperform machine  learning and AI methods. In addition, if we are far off in our assumptions  the results can be very poor. One thing for sure, having to add assumptions  adds work for the data scientist. However, it is also a misnomer that machine  learning requires no assumptions. Every analytics technique requires cer- tain assumptions; it is only the depth and complexity of assumptions that  change.   PARAMETRIC STATISTICS AND WHERE THEY MAY  OUTPERFORM MACHINE LEARNING PARADIGMS   Parametric  statistics  is  a  branch  of  statistics  that  assumes  sample  data  come from a population where the population can be adequately mod- eled by a family of statistical distributions. A family of statistical distribu- tions is just a set of functional  mathematical  forms with a set of constants  or parameters – thus “parametric.” If you have heard of the “Bell Curve”  you have heard of a statistical distribution, a functional form. Statisticians  have  developed  many  of  these  distributions  and  the  mathematics  that  goes along with them to solve a wide range of problems. If I can assume  a  functional  form  and  those  assumptions  hold,  then  algorithms  using  statistical  distributions  are  often  more  powerful  than  distribution  free  methods like classifcation and regression trees and other methods we  covered in Chapter 6.    Stats, Causation, Prescriptive Analytics  ◾  235           How can parametric statistics outperform machine learning?    The  estimators  in  many  statistical  methods  are  determined  via  math- ematical application, typically calculus  e.g., frst and second derivative  tests . This results in the closed-form solution we previously discussed.  This area of statistics is “mathematical statistics.” When an optimum is  found using these methods, it means there is no better estimate, period.  However, this optimum requires certain conditions; for example the data  was drawn from a family of “Bell Curves.”   Non-parametric  statistical  learning,  machine  learning  and  AI  meth- ods are “model free” and have no closed-form solution for an optimum.  Instead,  a  computer  algorithm  is  used  to  search  for  an  optimum   see  Chapter 6, “AI models may think locally  greedy ” . NOTE: Not all machine  learning methods are non-parametric! We use this computer algorithm to  cycle through a set of operations and search for this optimum within a  specifed search space. The downside is that the algorithm may get stuck  and not fnish, or it may stop in a local optimum, meaning there is a bet- ter result, a global optimum that exists, but it could not fnd it.   Supposing  that  the  assumptions  of  the  parametric  statistical  method   holds, it may outperform a machine learning method.   Non-Parametric and Distribution Free Statistics  Assumption Light    Non-parametric statistics do not include assumptions of parametrized fami- lies of probability distributions  like the “Bell Curve” family mentioned . For  simplicity, let us consider distribution free statistics, sometimes called “order  statistics” or “rank statistics.” This type of statistics requires no assump- tion of the functional or statistical distribution of the population; thus they  are non-parametric. This branch of statistics mimics parametric statistics in  many ways. However, after drawing the sample, the values of the sample are  sorted low to high. Non-parametric statistical inference can be performed  with these ranked samples. The median is an often-reported statistic and it  is the middle value in an ordered or ranked list of values. An example of  rank order inference is trying to estimate the population median.   This form of statistics is very robust and there are many forms of it  including Bayesian forms. One example, in addition to all the forms of  regression mentioned in Chapter 6, we can add “median,” “percentile” or  “quantile” regression that overcomes some of the shortfalls of standard forms    236  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     of regression. Quantile regression is part of a broader class of regression  called “robust regression.” The advantage of robust methods is that we do  not have to make many assumptions. On the downside, they take longer to  compute and they may not be as powerful as parametric methods.   Note: unlike closed-form parametric statistical methods, we use recursive   algorithms to fnd solutions to these robust methods.   ANOTHER TERM – STATISTICAL LEARNING!   A  very  good  reference  for  the  intersection  of  Statistics  and  Machine  Learning was written by three Stanford authors  Drs. Hastie, Tibshirani,  and Friedman; see Hastie, 2017 – second edition . It is a landmark book  titled  The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and  Prediction; in the preface you will read:      With  the  advent  of  computers  and  the  information  age,  statistical  problems have exploded both in size and complexity… Vast amounts  of data are being generated in many felds, and the statistician’s job  is to make sense of it all: to extract important patterns and trends,  and  understand  “what  the  data  says.”  We  call  this  learning  from  data. The challenges in learning from data have led to a revolution  in the statistical sciences. Since computation plays such a key role,  it  is  not  surprising  that  much  of  this  new  development  has  been  done by researchers in other felds such as computer science and  engineering…  This book is our attempt to bring together many of  the important new ideas in learning, and explain them in a statistical  framework.      We like this quote: it illustrates the marriage of statistics and data min- ing  machine learning  and AI. The book is a great reference for machine  learning methods for practitioners and developers.   Four Domains in Statistics to Mention   Statistics in Predictive Analytics   It is useful to note that statistics is an integral part of all predictive analyt-   ics. From the simple idea of sampling to the complete end-to-end model  development including the predictive analytic algorithm itself, statistics will      Stats, Causation, Prescriptive Analytics  ◾  237           be involved somewhere. However, you will hear about machine learning    and AI vs statistics to build predictive models. What this means is some- thing more specifc; it typically means a choice between using a parametric    statistical model development method that carries with it more assump- tions and using a “model free” machine learning or AI model develop- ment method. From a practical standpoint, it is often preferred to go with    a “model free” machine learning or AI algorithm. Why? Because it doesn’t    carry the burdens of the assumptions. And, if we use the statistical alterna- tive and it turns the assumptions are wrong I can end up with a bad pre- dictive model.   NOTE: As we have said all predictive analytics has assumptions.     We use the term “parametric statistical model” above to contrast it to    “model free” statistical methods such as quantile regression mentioned    previously.   Design of Experiments  DoE      The gold standard for proving whether one factor causes another is a    randomized controlled trial  RCT . RCT requires a design of treatments     interventions  and responses  results . Statistical DoE  see Kirk, 2012  is    the hallmark to make sure the statistical design supports the intents and  hypotheses of the study  experiments . The importance of establishing cau-   sation means that you know more than the fact that two things are merely    associated. One causing the other means you may be able to intervene    in the system and alter inputs that dictate the output. Without an RCT, it    is diffcult to “prove” causality. We will look at alternatives in this chapter    as well as discuss a Bayesian network as an implementation of a causal  model.   BMJ  a global healthcare knowledge provider affliated with 8,000 medi- cal organizations worldwide  presented a nice paper on the importance of  controls in experiments  Wartolowska et al., 2014 .   Statistical Process Control  SPC    As we said in Chapter 3, all data is driven by processes. Everything we  observe and tabulate is generated from a process. SPC is a very popular  statistical method used in manufacturing, healthcare and business pro- cesses. The manufacturing case is the most intuitive for understanding  and was the original intent for SPC  Muelaner, 2019 . In a simple case, you  have a machine producing a part. You need this part manufactured within    238  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     specifcation limits  measurements the part was designed for and will be  sold against such requirements . Suppose we have upper and lower design  limits for diameter. Machines naturally produce parts that will vary even  when a machine is running as intended. You also have machine drift, mean- ing that the machine will produce parts that grow a little larger, then a little  larger still, so that if an intervention is not taken and the machine recali- brated, the parts it produces will not be within the specifed limits and the  parts are scrapped.   SPC allows you to determine when that machine is producing as it   should, or whether an intervention is needed before it starts producing  scrap. You might think an expert operator could do this without SPC, but  humans cannot determine the difference between normal variation and  special variation  Hunter, 2014 . SPC saves companies huge scrap costs. And  SPC is not limited to manufacturing; it is very useful in service industries   Zolkepley, Djauhari and Salleh, 2018 .            There are thousands of statistical procedures. Why are we highlighting  SPC? The reason we are specifcally calling out SPC here is its power, long  history, and wide use; it does not have a surrogate in the other data-driven  techniques we are describing. In other words, you cannot achieve the goals  of determining process control in machine learning, AI or an optimization  technique. It supports our continuing message that you need knowledge  of many varied techniques and methods to be ready to handle any sort of  data-driven problem you might face.   Time Series   Time series is a widely used technique in economics; in fact, it might be  the most widely used statistical method that the U.S. government uses for  forecasting economic data. De-trending, seasonal adjustments and forecasts  are time series methods used by federal and state governments. Economists  and econometricians are big users of the time series. Finance professionals  in banking, brokerage and investment corporations also use it in the capital  markets  stocks and bonds  analysis and trading.   We highlight time series for similar reasons that we mentioned SPC: for      its power, long history, wide use, and the fact that it does not have a   good   transparent  surrogate in the other data-driven techniques we are  describing. Time series is a good tool for any analytics professional to have  in their repertoire.       Stats, Causation, Prescriptive Analytics  ◾  239           An Ever-Important Reminder     In many chapters, we have compared methods providing their strengths and  weaknesses. It is time to repeat something we said earlier in the book. When    someone asks you what is the best machine learning method for classifca- tion? Or, says “Random Forests are better than k-nearest neighbors.” Respond    by saying: “according to what criteria?” We get involved in this trap of jumping    to offer an opinion or suggestion by assuming we know what the criteria are.      It is human nature. It is likely because we are all busy and assumptions save  time, but it is important to know what the constraints and goals are before    making recommendations. A good idea is to pause and refect now and then.  That is one of the main motivations of this book. Remember the “No Free   Lunch Theorem” in Chapter 3. No paradigm, methodology or technique is  universally optimal to solve all problems. If it was, game over; go home.  That is why we think that the more knowledge of the tools, techniques, and  interdependency of these domains  computer science, operations research,  statistics, etc. , the better equipped anyone is for a career in analytics. And  we mean analytics from the C-suite to the department manager to the pro- duction engineer or physician.   So, if someone says deep learning will solve the entire world’s problems,  or everything can be formatted as a linear program  more on that in Chapter    11 , then just smile. They have just indicated they likely have a limited tool  set. Moreover, they defnitely have a limited way of looking at solutions to  problems.   WHEN STATISTICS FAIL   Statistical inference for very large samples fails. Why? One of the com- ponents of determining a signifcant difference is the standard error of  the estimate. The standard error is a function of the sample size. As the  sample size increases, the standard error decreases. This makes sense:  the larger sample size implies more information thus less error. However,  for  very  large  samples  this  will  lead  to  calling  everything  statistically  signifcant.    240  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     A POTENTIAL ISSUE WITH ANY DATA- DRIVEN APPROACH – SAMPLING BIAS   One of the biggest problems in any analytics method is sampling bias.  We mentioned bias in the section “Classical or Frequentist Statistics” in  talking about our new school referendum poll. Statistics get a bad rap  about missing actuals in elections and polling. There are several reasons  for this, but this is primarily due to sampling bias and not mathematics.   Statistics Summary   What is the basis for statistics? Using a sample to describe, understand or  make an inference. That is 99% of it. Statistics is part of the analytics eco- system and a part of the machine learning and the AI process. As we have  been saying, these technologies work together and therefore you should  have some basic knowledge of all of them.   However, there are some drawbacks; let us discuss these drawbacks now.  Statistics may involve:            1  Assumptions of functional forms for the populations, relationships of     the observations from populations and more     2  Misunderstanding and misapplication of statistical methods   The frst point involves the applications of statistics; the practitioner carries  extra responsibilities with these assumptions. The second is not the fault of  statistics, but the practitioner. If a cook cuts themselves dicing onions with a  knife, the problem is not the knife, but the misapplication of the knife.   Additional tools are useful. Machine learning avoids many of the issues   of statistical assumptions and maybe a preferred method for many problems   use a food processor instead of a knife . Knowledge is power and it does  beft the data scientist to understand the power and limitations of statistical  theory and methods.   Advantages of Statistics vs BI, Machine Learning and AI        1  Statistics work with small samples. Data scientists may work with data  in small samples where many machine learning algorithms will fail. AI    Stats, Causation, Prescriptive Analytics  ◾  241           2  Statistics work with a univariate series  a single variable . Time series     algorithms typically require even more data when compared to other  machine learning algorithms.    forecasts can be made using the historical series. Statistical Process    Control uses the past behavior of a series to determine whether a pro- cess is acting as expected  in control  vs not as expected  out of control .    cal methods to their tool set face new problems and solutions every  day, thus there is more variety. Machine learning modelers that use the  same algorithms, apply the same process over and over – data prep,  model, compare models, deploy – may make signifcant mistakes that  would not have been made if they had knowledge of all the tools.   3  Career variety and interests. Data scientists and others that add statisti-  Disadvantages of Statistics vs BI, Machine Learning and AI      1  Statistical hypothesis  signifcance  testing falls apart for very large     samples. You will always reject the null hypothesis concluding a sta- tistically signifcant result when there may not be any practical signif- cance. This is because as the sample sizes get very large  like millions  of observations  the standard error gets very small and you will reject  even minute differences.    distribution free statistics   non-parametric statistics.   2  More assumptions are required for any problems of inference, except in                  POLLS AND STATISTICS – APPLICATION PROBLEM,   NOT A METHODOLOGY PROBLEM   Many things are misunderstood about statistics; as the saying goes – Lies,  Damned Lies and Statistics.      Statistics is rooted in mathematics. The theory is solid. The methodol-   ogy  is  built  on  this  theory.  You  have  to  mathematically  prove  statistical  theorems. However, there is a lot of room for misapplication and assump-   tions that invalidate the practice. A perfect example is polling. The actual    mathematics is solid and unlike what most people think, you can estimate  a binary  yes no  outcome within a margin of error of ±3% from just 1,067    respondents  if these 1,067 respondents represent a “truly random sample” .  However, the practice of sampling must be followed carefully and the  results are only valid at the time of the poll – not 3 weeks into the       242  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     future.  These  are  where  the  application  of  statistics  fails.  Here  are  the  biggest failures in polls:                 1  People lie. Sorry, to be so blunt, but it is true. There are a number of  reasons this happens. It could be intentional or by mistake accident. It  could be to avoid embarrassment when being asked by a pollster.    2  Time lapses between polling and action. People change their minds,  they may answer a poll one way and by the time of the vote, they go  in a different direction.    3  The poll sample is not taken correctly. This is an example of sampling  bias. Sampling bias exists when your sampling is not representative of  the population under study. See Shirani-Mehr et al., 2018.    non-objective.   4  Misunderstanding.  Questions  on  questionnaires  can  be  leading,   Comparison of Data-Driven Paradigms Thus Far   Keeping in mind the last section, where we want to be sure we defne what  is the best analytics to use, or simply state the assumptions, we can look at  a comparison of the data-driven methods, keeping in mind that there are  always trade-offs. Please see the individual chapters for detailed strengths  and weaknesses of various analytic methods. The following provides quick  elevator pitches on the major categories we have presented.   Business Intelligence  BI    BI is a form of descriptive analytics. BI should not be an end solution,  but as an adjunct to more powerful predictive and advanced analytics     unless the organization is just getting started or has a very limited budget .  Note, when these methods are employed and become part of the culture,    the return on investment is positive so you can scale quickly. Operational  BI is embedded within the fabric of the organization and provides a “single  version of the truth” since the dashboards were approved by leadership.  Project-based Visual BI is great for discovering relationships at the begin- ning of a project before predictive analytics is started and at the end when    the team is presenting the project story with dashboards.  See Chapter 5 for  details.     Stats, Causation, Prescriptive Analytics  ◾  243           Machine Learning and Data Mining   Machine learning and data mining have separate histories. They make  separate titles of books. However, from a practitioner’s standpoint, there are  no major differences between machine learning and data mining  refer to  Chapter 6 . Both are part of advanced analytics. The power to predict an  outcome provides a signifcant return on investment and the power to pre- scribe a course of action to achieve the desired outcome provides the great- est value of all  excluding optimization .  See Chapter 4 for details.    Artifcial Intelligence  AI    AI is all the rage these days even though digital AI has been around for  almost 70 years. AI is also a form of advanced analytics and can provide  predictive and prescriptive insights  prescriptive analytics . AI can be  extremely powerful and available to savvy business users, or what are called  citizen data scientists. The only problem is that you do not always know  how AI is coming up with its predictions and that is unacceptable in certain  business domains and government agencies.   Statistics   Statistics has been around a long time and can provide descriptive and    advanced analytics. Statistics are embedded in BI, machine learning and  AI. There is a signifcant overlap of statistical learning and machine learn- ing  like Bayesian networks . For some statistics, you have to make certain  assumptions, which is an added burden, and if your assumptions are wrong,  your models may not be very good. Statistics can help with determining  causality, which is needed to prescribe a course of action.   We hope you noticed the common thread: It’s All Analytics!   ANECDOTE AND CONFIRMATION BIAS   Statistics and analytics work with samples to model populations. Anecdote  describes individuals.   We  often  disregard  statistics  because  they  do  not  substantiate  our  present thought and often we have experiences, little stories or anecdotes  that are not upheld by some statistic. That is often because the statistic    244  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     is not wrong, but because we love story and anecdote. You should not  try and apply a statistic to an individual. Kobe Bryant was 6'6", certainly  taller than the average U.S. male, but not an extreme outlier. Don’t force    an  average  on  an  individual  and  do  not  think  an  individual  is  average.   Individuals are unique. Statistics are generalities.  People often look for news or material that supports their prior beliefs.  This  is  confrmation  bias.  The  defnition  of  confrmation  bias  “is  the  tendency  to  interpret  new  evidence  as  confrmation  of  one’s  existing  beliefs or theories”  12 30 19, Bing, Powered by Oxford Dictionary . It is  important to note that we are all biased by our experiences and opin- ions. Scott’s major professor  a true Bayesian  had a saying that “the only  objective people were the ones that knew they were subjective.”   Predictive Analytics vs Prescriptive Analytics –  The Missing Link Is Causation      In Chapter 4, we covered the various types of analytics and showed a fgure  that illustrates the common categories. The analytics community uses this  diagram to illustrate the increasing value from moving from one type of ana- lytics to another form  see Figure 10.2 . The gold standards are prescriptive  analytics and process optimization.   In predictive analytics, we want to predict an outcome  disease, pur- chase, success  for a new observation based on characteristics of this new  observation. For disease classifcation  disease present   disease not present ,    we use historical data to build and validate our predictive model. We can  then use data on a new patient to determine the probability  score  that this  new patient has the disease. These models are extremely useful, as often- times all you need is to predict an outcome, as you have no practical way of  controlling the inputs to the process or systems that produce this outcome.   What if we can control the inputs? What if we can infuence the outcome  by manipulating the inputs? This is prescriptive analytics. Further, it can  lead to the top of the mountain, which is process optimization  a little  about that in the next chapter .   Suppose we want to determine the likelihood a given high school student  will go to college upon graduation. It is simple enough to use historical data    Stats, Causation, Prescriptive Analytics  ◾  245           Figure 10.2  A visual reference of a generally accepted classifcation scheme for  analytics.      and build a predictive model to determine the probability that a new student  will go to college based on these factors. Suppose I do this and the model  works great  high predictive accuracy and reproducibility .   What is the next logical step? I want to increase the number of high school     graduates that go to college. Can I use my predictive model to prescribe a    method to increase this rate? The simple answer is not without more consider- ation. To turn a predictive model into a prescriptive model we need to:          1  Assume or establish causation  2  Be able to manipulate the important variables  3  Not perturb the system          Some professionals build predictive models, look at the primary factors  that determine the outcome  the highest associated predictors to the out- come  and say we can manipulate these inputs to get the desired output.  No. The difference between predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics is  causation.   Note the shade difference in the boxes in Figure 10.2. Descriptive ana-  lytics requires no relationship between any variables. Predictive analytics    requires a correlation between the inputs and the outcomes. Diagnostic      246  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     and prescriptive analytics, as well as process optimization, require causa- tion between the inputs and the outcome.   You can build a good predictive model without causation. You just need     correlation association. We have addressed this in several sections. It is amaz- ing that professionals that know correlation does not mean causation will still      think it is okay to just “turn” a predictive model into a prescriptive model. You  can do it of course, but you should at least be careful and know the assump- tions you are making. If you simply take a predictive model and use it as a    prescriptive model, there are two things that can happen. One has to do with    correlation vs causation. The second has to do with the limitations of systems.         1  You could be wrong in assuming that your factors are causative.     Thus, manipulation of the inputs will not provide the results you are  expecting.    2  You may perturb the system. If the system has a causal relationship and  you manipulate variables, you will affect the system itself. This can also  happen whether you manipulate variables or not, as systems change  over time. However, you should take care in your manipulation and not  try and “shock” the system with the manipulation of your inputs.   MODEL DECLARATION AND HUMOR   Scott likes the show The Offce, and the whole issue of declaring a predic- tive model as a prescriptive model reminds him of an episode. Michael  Scott is underwater fnancially, and Oscar is helping him with the situ- ation. Oscar tells him that he feels Michael should declare bankruptcy.  Michael is distraught, but later in the show comes into the bullpen of the  offce,  climbs  on  desk  and  shouts,  “I  declare  bankruptcy!”  Sometimes,  you need just a little more.   Assuming or Establishing Causation   For the purposes of “turning” predictive models into prescriptive models we  must do one of the two:        1  Assume causation  2  Determine causation            Stats, Causation, Prescriptive Analytics  ◾  247           In certain applications, it is acceptable to assume causation. If you have  good research or reason to assume causation, you can do that; just be aware  there is a signifcant downside if you are wrong. In the areas of physics  and chemistry where relationships are well behaved, it is easier to assume  causation. Many of these relationships are rooted in deep scientifc inquiry  and are well documented. These are typically determined by the scientifc  method and statistics, which we previously discussed. Alternatively, things  like vehicle traffc optimization are causal, as we know the route taken has a  causal effect on the time it takes to get to the destination.   In other areas, such as the biological and behavioral sciences, the   relationships are more unclear. They could be causal or just correlated.  Biological systems are messy in that there are tens of thousands or even mil- lions of factors involved. How many times have you heard medical science  and the FDA  Food and Drug Administration  reverse itself even with pub- lished peer review research? Behavioral mechanisms often lack effective  measurement systems and we often measure downstream activity. Rather  than assume causation, it is often preferred to establish causation.   Causality at a minimum requires three elements:          1  Correlation  covariation  of cause and effect.  2  Time order  temporal precedence . The cause happens before the effect.  3  Elimination of extraneous causes.          Determining causation scientifcally requires manipulation of treatments or    some intervention based upon some experimental design. This design has to    include some time  temporal  component so that the practitioner can see the    “before” and the “after” effect. Again, the gold standard to determine causation    is the RCT described under the “Design of Experiments  DoE ” section above.   THREE COUNTER-EXAMPLES WHERE GOOD PREDICTIVE   MODELS DO NOT MAKE PRESCRIPTIVE MODELS   ◾  Time  temporal  relevance  ◾  Spurious correlation or confounding variable  ◾  Mediation problems          Time Dependency – Suppose I tell you I have a great predictive model    for predicting rain and my model is almost 100% accurate! The model      248  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     has  been  cross-validated  with  precision.  I  have  used  all  of  the  most      relevant techniques and my methodology is sound. Then you ask me  what the strongest predictor in my model is and I say the presence of    mud!  This  model  is  very  predictive!  Can  it  be  used  as  a  prescriptive    model? No. Why? For a prescriptive model, you need causality. For    X to cause Y, then X must precede Y  temporal precedence . In simple    words, the “presence of mud” can ONLY come about AFTER the rain    has occurred – thus MUD is a result of rain, not a cause or predictor    of rain!!!   Suppose that X causes Z  X → Z  and X causes Y  X → Y . Can you  conclude that Y causes Z? No. We have heard that salt causes heart prob- lems. Is that true? What seems to be established is that salt is associated  with hypertension  high blood pressure  and hypertension is associated  with heart and vascular problems. However, there is not a lot of evidence  that salt causes heart and vascular problems. There is a nice article by  Harvard,  “Heart  Failure  and  Salt:  The  Great  Debate”   Harvard  Health  Publishing, December 2018  that states there is no conclusive evidence  that you can say that salt causes heart disease.   Suppose you have X → Y → Z  X causes Y and in turn Y causes Z .  Y, in this case, is the mediator. The mediator may have a minor effect  or a major effect. In other words, is X the primary causer of Z or only  when Y is present do you see a strong causal relationship? Traditional  predictive models will not tease out the strength of these relationships.  That is where mediation statistics can provide the answers and help with  prescription  Columbia Public Health, Causal Mediation .   Ladder of Causation   Let us briefy comment on Judea Pearl’s “Ladder of Causation”; this can be  found in Pearl’s latest book, The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and  Effect  Pearl and Mackenzie, 2018 . It describes causation as a continuum and  not a yes no proposition. To discuss three levels in simple terms we like, we  refer to examples in a blog by Michiel Stock  https:  michielstock.github.io   causality .     Prediction is what we have been discussing. An example of this “What                        is the expected lifespan of somebody who is vegetarian and does not  smoke?” This is what we want from predictive models.    Stats, Causation, Prescriptive Analytics  ◾  249           Intervention is being able to guess what the effect will be if one per- forms an action. This is what we want from prescriptive models. Example:  How would my expected lifespan change if I become a vegetarian? NOTE:  Our intervention changes the system. If our intervention changes the system  too much, we may warp the system and not get the results we want in the  future with our current prescriptive model.   Counterfactuals  imagining  are being able to reason about a hypotheti-  cal situation. What are the things that could happen? Imagining in intellec- tual activities, such as performing thought experiments, making up a story  or inventing a new cooking recipe. Example: Would my grandfather still be  alive if he did not smoke?   Predicting an Increasing Trend – Structural    Causal Models and Causal Inference   Although it is not new, we believe the work by Judea Pearl and similar  researchers in causal models will be adopted more and more over the  next few years. It is extremely powerful and promising. It incorporates the  Bayesian paradigm, which we mentioned near the beginning of the chapter   we also believe general Bayesian methods are poised for a new resurgence .  It can answer questions that many other methods cannot, such as the exam- ples in the preceding section, “Ladder of Causation,” and in the following  gray box, “What Is Causal Inference?”   How these models are constructed is beyond the scope of this book. Let   us just note a few highlights and provide a few references.   ◾  Data are dumb. There are articles that have proposed “big data”  mas-    sively abundant data  will be the death of the scientifc method and  even the death of the need for models! Do they know the defnition  of a model? We think these are typically written by the uninitiated or  Hypers! For example, in “The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes  the Scientifc Method Obsolete”  Anderson, 2008 , Judea Pearl states,  “We live in an era that presumes Big Data to be the solution to all our  problems… but I hope with this book to convince you that data are  profoundly dumb”  referring to his The Book of Why; see Pearl and  Mackenzie, 2018 . Furthermore, “You will never get causal information  out without beginning by putting causal hypotheses in,” which means  you will never get knowledge by throwing a bunch of data in an algo- rithm and hoping for the best  Maudlin, September 2019 .    250  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     ◾  We need education to start the revolution. We need education at     all levels, but we need to start by replacing much that is taught cur- rently as statistics in undergraduate and graduate programs. Classical  statistics is taught the same way it has been taught for decades. There  is some value in this, but if students are going to be taught one course,  Bayesian and causal modeling are much more productive – i.e., practical  for the needs of society. To this end, Judea Pearl has donated the Turing  Prize money to the American Statistical Association to establish an  annual prize for a person or team that contributes substantially toward  introducing causal inference in education.   ◾  Data may help us predict what will happen, but even today’s    most sophisticated machine learning can’t tell us why. That is  the crux of the last two sections of this chapter. You need to know why  something is happening before you can prescribe  prescriptive analyt- ics  the actions to take to achieve the desired results.   ◾  Use of graphical methods  combinations of equations and graphs      and graph data will continue to explode. Causal models are often built  on directed acyclic graphs  DAGs, see Chapter 6 . The data in graph  databases will be greatly increasing as well as the practical application  of these methods. For a basic introduction to DAGs applied to pediatric  medicine and research, see Williams, Bach, and Matthiesen et al.  2018 .   WHAT IS CAUSAL INFERENCE?   In his own words in an interview with Ron Wasserstein  Amstat News   2012  Judea Pearl defnes Causal inference as   Causal  inference  is  a  methodology  for  answering  causal  research  questions  from  a  combination  of  data  and  theoretical  assump- tions  about  how  the  data  are  generated.  Typical  causal  questions  are the following: What is the expected effect of a given treatment   e.g., drug  on a given outcome  e.g., recovery ? Can data prove an  employer guilty of hiring discrimination? Would a given patient be  alive if he had not taken the drug, knowing that he, in fact, did take  the drug and died? The distinct feature of these sorts of questions  is that they cannot be answered from  nonexperimental  frequency  data alone, regardless of how many samples are taken; nor can they    Stats, Causation, Prescriptive Analytics  ◾  251           be expressed in the standard language of statistics, for they cannot  be defned in terms of joint densities of observed variables.  Skeptics  are  invited  to  write  down  a  mathematical  expression  for  the  sen- tence, “The rooster crow does not cause the sun to rise.”    Summary   Some authors and practitioners have said that machine learning and AI will  replace statistics: that now, with extremely powerful computers and unlim- ited data storage, we don’t need statistics anymore. They either didn’t know  or have forgotten that machine learning uses statistics extensively – all the  time – without fail. Remember our defnition of statistics – characteristics of  a sample – a training set, a test set, a validation set – all subsets of a popula- tion. In addition, there are thousands of statistics generated in the machine  learning process. Any prediction is about a future observation and that  observation is generated from a process. This gets some people because  they think of populations as static and historical. Therefore, in any predic- tive analytics we are using past data, a population subset, ergo a sample  to predict future values  part of a population . Thus, predictive analytics is  predicated on statistics!   Postscript   This has been a lengthy and important chapter. Statistics, prescriptive analyt- ics, and causal modeling are three very important subjects for all informed  analytics professionals and data scientists. It will be very exciting to see how  these subjects advance over the next few years.   In the next chapter, we provide some fnal insights on data-driven meth-  odologies and academic disciplines as endnotes for future considerations.  These are deeply applicable to analytics.    252  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     References   Amstat News. November 1, 2020.

By now, you certainly under-   stand that these are not freestanding disciplines, but methodologies built over  many years with a lot of cross-pollination by very intelligent and dedicated    professionals. If we wrote everything we would like to say, this book would      be far too long. So, we thought we would include some end notes and some  areas for future considerations that are deeply applicable to analytics.   Introduction   From an academic departmental view, many disciplines feed into analytics.  They have their own version or application of analytics that are specifc to   255    256  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     professionals or academics in that feld. There is origination of ideas, there  is borrowing of ideas and there are movements of great thinkers across  disciplines.   Today, analytics is so prevalent that we cannot think of an area that does  not include some sort of analytics. Music, for example, would seem an area  independent of analytics. But music actually offers a great opportunity for  research with machine learning. History and literature are huge areas for  text analytics.   We have covered many areas of study, but we want to be sure to mention   some areas that are particularly ripe with their own contributions and offer  specifc analytic tools that we have not covered.   Computer Science   Computer science is such a large feld that has its fngerprints all over ana- lytics. We have touched on some form of it in every chapter and deeply  in some; for example, see the extensive discussion of data engineering in  Chapter 8. Data engineers and many analytics professionals come from com- puter science programs or experiential backgrounds. In this section, we just  want to point out one important area of contribution that you should con- sider exploring more deeply.   Many academic computer science departments have dedicated divi- sions  or labs  in cognitive systems or AI. We spoke in the last chapter    about Judea Pearl, who is a professor in the Cognitive Systems Lab of the    Computer Science Department at UCLA. He also won the Turing Award from    the Association for Computing Machinery. If you are a movie fan, see The    Imitation Game  2014 , which portrays the genius of Alan Turing. Dr. Pearl      represents a cross-section between data science, AI and statistics. He has a  Ph.D. in electrical engineering, teaches in a computer science department and    was awarded a Fellowship of the American Statistical Association in 2019.   We mentioned connections of AI to computer science in Chapter 7.   When expanding your data science and AI horizons, keep computer science  in mind. We list a few options in the “For the Avid Learner” section at the  end of this chapter.   A STATISTICIAN OR A COMPUTER SCIENTIST?   Judea Pearl was asked a question in an interview with the president of  the  American  Statistical  Association,  Ron  Wasserstein   see  Pearl,  J.  as    Other Disciplines to Dive in Deeper  ◾  257           interviewed by Wasserstein, R., Amstat News  2012  . “Do you consider  yourself a statistician or a computer scientist, or is that a distinction you  even make when you think of yourself and your work?”   To which he replied,   There  is  a  lot  in  common  to  statisticians  and  computer  scientists,  especially those working on machine learning and inference under  uncertainty. Both are attempting to make sense of data, and both  are going about it in a systematic way. The distinction comes in two  dimensions: frst, what it means to “make sense of data” and, sec- ond, what language we use in our mathematics.   There is a great opportunity for academic and professional camps to   work together and learn from each other.   Management Science   The origins of management science are rooted in operations research,  which we will cover in a moment. Both are covered by a large professional  organization, INFORMS  The Institute for Operations Research and the  Management Sciences , which is “dedicated to and promoting best practices  and advances in operations research, management science, and analytics to  improve operational processes, decision-making, and outcomes.” INFORMS  has a very active community of researchers and practitioners.   According to INFORMS, topics covered in Management Science  journal    include:   Business Strategy  Decision Analysis  Entrepreneurship  Operations  Optimization and Modeling  Product Development  Simulation  Social Networks  Stochastic Models  Supply Chain Management    258  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Academic programs normally merge operations research and management  science together into one program  e.g. Berkeley College of Engineering .  However, there are differences and you will see books dedicated to manage- ment science; for example, see Winston and Albright  2018 , which is a great  survey book of the subject.   Decision Science   Decision science is a broad and varied feld. From our research, there is a  bit of a divide with some camps calling it more behavioral, social and public  policy oriented, and others calling it more business focused. Decision sci- ence is strongly aligned with analytics.   From a view of academic programs  such as University of Pennsylvania  and Harvard , decision science has strong roots and alliances in social and  public policy and public health.      On the business side, in an article in INFORMS Analytics Magazine  see    Rajaram, 2018 , Dhiraj Rajaram defnes decision science as an overarching  discipline above data science and that while data science problems are nor- mally clearly defned, decision science problems are not:   Decision science is the interdisciplinary application of business,    math, technology, design thinking, and behavioral sciences to    enable better decisions. Decision science enables addressing    business problems that are ill defned and shifting and where    the factors affecting the problem are not completely understood.    It facilitates the design thinking paradigm: Taking business prob- lems that start off as a hunch or as mysteries to becoming heu- ristic, rules, and judgment based, to becoming algorithm as one    starts to see patterns, to becoming codifed and tool-ifed in parts    before being operationalized in systems. Further it enables the    on-going creation, translation, and consumption of data-driven    insights to help organizations make better decisions. Decision  science integrates and builds on data sciences by add- ing the aspects of business context, design thinking, and    behavioral sciences.   There are schools, such as Notre Dame, whose programs are more business  oriented. One thing in common among the camps is that decision science    Other Disciplines to Dive in Deeper  ◾  259           includes the way we think, along with the way judgments and decisions are  made. This is an extension outside of traditional data science.   Operations Research   Operations research is the application of scientifc and mathematical meth- ods to the study and analysis of problems involving complex systems. We  mentioned that operations research is akin  the father  to management sci- ence. Modern operations research got started in the world wars by British  and U.S. forces. It was developed primarily in the areas of logistics  moving  troops and supplies , communications, optimizing weapon effectiveness and  effcient use of Allied forces and supplies. In WWII, Britain had close to  1,000 women and men engaged in operations research. In the United States,  George Dantzig, who is considered the father of linear programming, helped  with U.S. logistics. Dantzig had a huge impact on the feld and developed  the Simplex Algorithm, which effciently solved complex linear programming  problems. Dantzig was the frst to express the criterion for selecting a good  or best plan as an explicit mathematical function, a function that we now  call the “objective function.”   In a nutshell, operations research is focused on mathematical optimi- zation by using a broad array of modeling paradigms and algorithms. Its  contribution to data science is rich and important. Route optimization  which  includes programming your car’s GPS  uses operations research methods,  social analytics uses operations research network models, and pricing sci- ence uses operations research constraint optimization.   NOTE: these optimization techniques are not informal – they are  mathematical. This means that they don’t loosely fulfll a heuristic like “I  want to optimize my customer outreach.” Instead, they optimize a quanti- tative objective function such as “what is the price that maximizes margin  given a set of mathematical constraints such as production volume limits,  geographical constraints, cross-product cannibalism maximums?” These for- mulas are confgured into an optimization engine that performs thousands  and thousands of calculations and provides a solution for the price that  maximizes the objective. The positive is that you fnd “the right price” the  drawback is that you have to rigorously defne and formulate the problem.   The study of operations research is very useful for any analytics pro- fessional as it provides a rich area for fnding solutions to a broad set of  problems.    260  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     Engineering   Engineering is an extremely wide-ranging feld. It is deeply grounded in    mathematics and analytics. At the same time, it develops new applications of    analytics all the time. Let us point out that computer engineering, software    engineering, and electrical engineering are closely related to computer science,    which we have briefy touched upon. All are quantitative in nature and inter- twined with the methods of this book. Industrial engineering  IE  is similar      to operations research in that IE employs methods of linear programming,  constraint optimization, and other optimization techniques. It is useful for data    scientists and analytics professionals to explore these methods further.   Finance and Econometrics   Finance and economics are big producers and users of analytic methods.  The development of such models as asset pricing  like capital asset pricing  models, CAPM  and bond duration  Macaulay and modifed duration  are  fnancial models that make sophisticated practices more accessible to practi- tioners in fnance. Econometricians use calculus and mathematics to develop  close-formed solutions such as the demand function  differential calculus .  They also use the advanced statistical and machine learning algorithms we  discussed in Chapters 6 and 10 to model markets and economies.      Simulation, Sensitivity and Scenario Analysis   While not an academic domain, we did want to mention some techniques    used across a broad spectrum of analytics. We mentioned simulation in    Chapter 9 as part of the synthetic data topic. This data is generated by a com- puter from a conceptual  mental  model. The model is based on our subjective    knowledge of a process or phenomenon. We can generate data via computer    code to formulate and augment our intelligence. No formal data is required.   Here are some quick applications of simulation:   Sensitivity Analysis   While some models, like AI, are a black box and we cannot trace the  exact method that algorithm is using to generate an output  score , we can    Other Disciplines to Dive in Deeper  ◾  261           determine which are the most important contributors to that outcome using  sensitivity analysis. Simplistically, we take the model code and perturb the  inputs  thousands of times  while examining the effect on the outcome via a  simulation. The inputs that contribute the most variability in the outcome are  the ones most important to the model.   Scenario Analysis   Scenario analysis uses simulation to analyze potential future events by consid- ering alternative possible outcomes. It is very popular in fnancial, economic    and political domains. Once a conceptual model is formulated, a researcher    can input potential future events and see how the impact affects the system.   Systems Thinking   A very powerful and often underused method of simulation applies to “systems    thinking.” It applies to biological systems, education, chemistry, physics, medi- cine, social and behavioral sciences, government, business and more. Systems    are sets of interrelated processes and the world is full of processes. These sys- tems and processes can be modeled with software. A programmer can write    the code for this software, or commercial systems are available. A researcher    models the system of interest and simulates it. The researcher then gains    insight from the system such as unknown relationships, feedback and rein- forcement mechanisms. These solutions are very useful in nonlinear analytics.   Postscript   engagement.   The opportunities for application and use of analytics goes on and on. We  fnd analytics used everywhere and its development and use will continue to  impact our lives.   The next chapter is very brief as we look forward to our next    262  ◾        It’s All Analytics!     References     Pearl, J. as interviewed by Wasserstein, R. November 2012.

Chapter 12    Looking Ahead   Farewell, Until Next Time     Scott and Gary  the authors  have enjoyed and been rewarded by many  years of learning and applying the art of data-driven solutions. The prob-   lems are so varied and the techniques to apply to these problems are so  rich and interesting that there is always something to be learned, some- thing to be nuanced in a way to ft the problem at hand. It makes for a    career of lifelong learning and no time to waste. It is always interesting    and rewarding if approached in an appropriate way. That is the reason for    this book.     We feel one should not go forward blindly with a hammer searching for a  nail. The task at hand is likely different from the one encountered yesterday  and requires a different set of tools or a twist of the application previously  employed.
