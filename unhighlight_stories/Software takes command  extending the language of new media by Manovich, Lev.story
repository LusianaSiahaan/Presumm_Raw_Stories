The  book  was  written  on  Apple  laptops   MacBook  Pro,  MacBook Air  using Microsoft Word. I used iPhone for email and  social networks, and for occasional note taking.    For  communication  with  the  colleagues  and  the  publisher,  I  relied on Gmail, Google Docs, Dropbox, Twitter, and Facebook.    The book illustrations were prepared by me and Jay Chow using  the  same  popular  software  applications  analyzed  in  this  book:  Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects.

Introduction  Understanding media  I  called  my  earlier  book-length  account  of  the  new  cultural  forms  enabled  by  computerization  The  Language  of  New  Media   completed in 1999, it came out in 2001 . By that time, the process  of  adoption  of  software-based  tools  in  all  areas  of  professional  media production was almost complete, and “new media art” was  in its heroic and vibrant stage—offering many possibilities not yet  touched by commercial software and consumer electronics.    Ten  years  later,  most  media  became  “new  media.”  The  devel- opments of the 1990s have been disseminated to the hundreds of  millions  of  people  who  are  writing  blogs,  uploading  photos  and  videos  to  media  sharing  sites,  and  use  free  media  authoring  and  editing software tools that ten years earlier would have cost tens of  thousands of dollars.    Thanks to the practices pioneered by Google, the world is now  used to running on web applications and services that have never  been  officially  completed  but  remain  forever  in  Beta  stage.  Since  these applications and services run on the remote servers, they can  be  updated  anytime  without  consumers  having  to  do  anything— and  in  fact,  Google  is  updating  its  search  algorithm  code  a  few  times  a  day.  Similarly,  Facebook  is  also  updating  its  code  daily,  and  sometimes  it  breaks.   Facebook’s  motto  expressed  in  posters  around its offices is “Move Fast and Break Things.”  Welcome to  the  world  of  permanent  change—the  world  that  is  now  defined    2   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  not by heavy industrial machines that change infrequently, but by  software that is always in flux.    Why  should  humanists,  social  scientists,  media  scholars,  and  cultural  critics  care  about  software?  Because  outside  of  certain  cultural areas such as crafts and fine art, software has replaced a  diverse array of physical, mechanical, and electronic technologies  used before the twenty-first century to create, store, distribute and  access  cultural  artifacts.  When  you  write  a  letter  in  Word   or  its  open  source  alternative ,  you  are  using  software.  When  you  are  composing  a  blog  post  in  Blogger  or  WordPress,  you  are  using  software.  When  you  tweet,  post  messages  on  Facebook,  search  through  billions  of  videos  on  YouTube,  or  read  texts  on  Scribd,  you are using software  specifically, its category referred to as “web  applications” or “webware”—software which is accessed via web  browsers and which resides on the servers .    And when you play a video game, explore an interactive instal- lation in a museum, design a building, create special effects for a  feature film, design a website, use a mobile phone to read a movie  review  or  to  view  the  actual  movie,  and  carry  out  thousands  of  other cultural activities, in practical terms, you are doing the same  thing—using  software.  Software  has  become  our  interface  to  the  world, to others, to our memory and our imagination—a universal  language through which the world speaks, and a universal engine  on  which  the  world  runs.  What  electricity  and  the  combustion  engine were to the early twentieth century, software is to the early  twenty-first century.   This  book  is  concerned  with  “media  software”—programs  such  as  Word,  PowerPoint,  Photoshop,  Illustrator,  After  Effects,  Final Cut, Firefox, Blogger, WordPress, Google Earth, Maya, and  3ds  Max.  These  programs  enable  creation,  publishing,  sharing,  and  remixing  of  images,  moving  image  sequences,  3D  designs,  texts, maps, and interactive elements, as well as various combina- tions  of  these  elements  such  as  websites,  interactive  applications,  motion  graphics,  virtual  globes,  and  so  on.  Media  software  also  includes web browsers such as Firefox and Chrome, email and chat  programs, news readers, and other types of software applications  whose  primary  focus  is  accessing  media  content   although  they  sometimes also include some authoring and editing features.    These software tools for creating, interacting with, and sharing  media  represent  a  particular  subset  of  application  software       INTRODUCTION    3  A digital studio in Seoul, South Korea, 1 2006. This small studio was  responsible for the photography of all Samsung phones, to appear in  its ads worldwide. In the photos we see studio staff adjusting the phone  photos in Photoshop. Later these high-resolution retouched images were  inserted in the Samsung TV ad, thus assuring that the product details are  clearly visible.   4   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND   including web applications  in general. Given this, we may expect  that all these tools inherit certain “traits” common to all contem- porary software. Does this mean that regardless of whether you are  working on designing a space, creating special effects for a feature  film,  designing  a  website,  or  making  information  graphics,  your  design process may follow a similar logic? Are there some struc- tural  features  which  motion  graphics,  graphic  designs,  websites,  product  designs,  buildings,  and  video  games  share  since  they  are  all designed with software? More generally, how are interfaces and  the tools of media authoring software shaping the contemporary  aesthetics and visual languages of different media forms?    Behind  these  questions  investigated  in  this  book  lies  another  theoretical  question.  This  question  drives  the  book  narrative  and  motivates  my  choice  of  topics.  What  happens  to  the  idea  of  a  “medium”  after  previously  media-specific  tools  have  been  simulated and extended in software? Is it still meaningful to talk  about different mediums at all? Or do we now find ourselves in a  new brave world of one single monomedium, or a metamedium  to  borrow the term of the book’s key protagonist Alan Kay ?     In short: What is “media” after software?   Does “media” still exist?  This book is a theoretical account of media software and its effects  on  the  practice  and  the  very  concept  of  media.  Over  the  last  two  decades,  software  has  replaced  most  other  media  technologies  that  emerged  in  the  nineteenth  and  twentieth  centuries.  Today  it  is  ubiquitous  and  taken  for  granted—and  yet,  surprisingly,  few  people  know  about  its  history  and  the  theoretical  ideas  behind  its  development.  You  are  likely  to  know  the  names  of  Renaissance  artists  who  popularized  the  use  of  linear  perspective  in  western  art   Brunelleschi, Alberti  or early twentieth-century inventors of modern  film language  D. W. Griffith, Eisenstein, etc. —but I bet you do not  know  where  Photoshop  comes  from,  or  Word,  or  any  other  media  tool  you  are  using  every  day.  More  importantly,  you  probably  do  not know why these tools were invented in the first place.   What  is  the  intellectual  history  of  media  software?  What  was  the thinking and motivation of the key people and research groups  they  were  directing—J.  C.  R.  Licklider,  Ivan  Sutherland,  Ted       INTRODUCTION    5  Nelson, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, Nicholas Negroponte—who  between  1960  and  the  late  1970s  created  most  of  the  concepts  and practical techniques that underlie today’s media applications?  As I discovered—and I hope you will share my original surprise,  in reading my analysis of the original texts by these people—they  were  as  much  media  theoreticians  as  computer  engineers.  I  will  discuss  their  media  theories  and  test  them  in  view  of  the  digital  media  developments  in  the  subsequent  decades.  As  we  will  see,  the theoretical ideas of these people and their collaborators work  very well today, helping us to better understand the contemporary  software we use to create, read, view, remix, and share.    Welcome, then, to the “secret history” of our software culture— secret  not  because  it  was  deliberately  hidden  but  because  until  recently, excited by all the rapid transformations cultural comput- erization  was  bringing  about,  we  did  not  bother  to  examine  its  origins.  This  book  will  try  to  convince  you  that  such  an  exami- nation is very much worth your time.   Its  title  pays  homage  to  a  seminal  twentieth-century  book  Mechanization  Takes  Command:  a  Contribution  to  Anonymous  History  1947  by architectural historian and critic Sigfried Giedion.  In this work Giedion traces the development of mechanization in  industrial society across a number of domains, including systems of  hygiene and waste management, fashion, agricultural production,  and  food  system,  with  separate  sections  of  the  book  devoted  to  bread,  meat,  and  refrigeration.  Much  more  modest  in  scope,  my  book presents episodes from the history of “softwarization”  my  neologism   of  culture  between  1960  and  2010,  with  a  particular  attention to media software—from the original ideas which led to  its development to its current ubiquity.    My  investigation  is  situated  within  a  broader  intellectual  paradigm of “software studies.” From this perspective, this book’s  contribution is the analysis of the ideas that eventually led to media  software, and the effects of the adoption of this type of software on  contemporary media design and visual culture.    Note  that  the  category  media  software  is  a  subset  of  the  category  application  software;  this  category  in  its  turn  is  a  subset  of  the  category  software1—which  I  understand  to  include     1 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki List_of_software_categories  July 7, 2011 .   6   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  not  only  application  software,  system  software,  and  computer  programming  tools,  but  also  social  network  services  and  social  media technologies.2   If we understand software in this extended sense, we can ask,  What does it mean to live in “software society”? And what does it  mean to be part of “software culture”? These are the questions the  next section will take up.  Software, or the engine of   contemporary societies  In the beginning of the 1990s, the most famous global brands were  the companies that were in the business of producing materials or  goods, or processing physical matter. Today, however, the lists of  best-recognized global brands are topped with the names such as  Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.  In fact, in 2007 Google became  number one in the world in terms of brand recognition.  And, at  least in the US, the most widely read newspapers and magazines— New York Times, USA Today, Business Week, etc.—feature daily  news  and  stories  about  Facebook,  Twitter,  Apple,  Google,  and  other IT companies.    What  about  other  media?  When  I  was  working  on  the  first  draft  of  this  book  in  2008,  I  checked  the  business  section  of  the  CNN website. Its landing page displayed market data for just ten  companies  and  indexes.3  Although  the  list  was  changed  daily,  it  was always likely to include some of the same IT brands. Let us  take January 21, 2008 as an example. On that day the CNN list  contained  the  following  companies  and  indexes:  Google,  Apple,  S&P 500 Index, Nasdaq Composite Index, Dow Jones Industrial     2 Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein define social media as “a group of Internet- based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of  Web  2.0,  which  allows  the  creation  and  exchange  of  user-generated  content.”  Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein, “Users of the world, unite! The challenges  and opportunities of Social Media,” Business Horizons 53, no. 1  January–February  2010 , pp. 59–68, http:  dx.doi.org 10.1016 j.bushor.2009.09.003   3 http:  money.cnn.com  January 21, 2008 .      INTRODUCTION    7  Average,  Cisco  Systems,  General  Electric,  General  Motors,  Ford,  Intel.4    This list is very telling. The companies that deal with physical  goods  and  energy  appear  in  the  second  part  of  the  list:  General  Electric, General Motors, Ford. Right before and after these three,  we  see  two  IT  companies  that  provide  hardware:  Intel  makes  computer chips, while Cisco makes network equipment. What about  the two companies which are on top: Google and Apple? The first  is in the business of information  “Google’s mission is to organize  the  world’s  information  and  make  it  universally  accessible  and  useful”5 , while the second is making consumer electronics: phones,  tablets, laptops, monitors, music players, etc. But actually, they are  both making something else. And apparently, this something else  is so crucial to the workings of US economy—and consequently,  global world as well—that these companies almost daily appear in  business news. And the major Internet companies that also appear  daily in news such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, eBay,  and Yahoo, are in the same business.    This  “something  else”  is  software.  Search  engines,  recommen- dation  systems,  mapping  applications,  blog  tools,  auction  tools,  instant  messaging  clients,  and,  of  course,  platforms  which  allow  people to write new software—iOS, Android, Facebook, Windows,  Linux—are in the center of the global economy, culture, social life,  and, increasingly, politics. And this “cultural software”—cultural  in a sense that it is directly used by hundreds of millions of people  and that it carries “atoms” of culture—is only the visible part of a  much larger software universe. In  Software  Society   2003 ,  an  unrealized  book  proposal  put    together by me and Benjamin Bratton, we described the importance  of  software  and  its  relative  invisibility  in  humanities  and  social  science research:   Software controls the flight of a smart missile toward its target  during war, adjusting its course throughout the flight. Software  runs  the  warehouses  and  production  lines  of  Amazon,  Gap,  Dell, and numerous other companies allowing them to assemble  and  dispatch  material  objects  around  the  world,  almost  in  no     4 Ibid.   5 http:  www.google.com about company   September 23, 2012 .   8   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  time.  Software  allows  shops  and  supermarkets  to  automati- cally  restock  their  shelves,  as  well  as  automatically  determine  which items should go on sale, for how much, and when and  where  in  the  store.  Software,  of  course,  is  what  organizes  the  Internet,  routing  email  messages,  delivering  Web  pages  from  a server, switching network traffic, assigning IP addresses, and  rendering Web pages in a browser. The school and the hospital,  the military base and the scientific laboratory, the airport and  the city—all social, economic, and cultural systems of modern  society—run on software. Software is the invisible glue that ties  it all together. While various systems of modern society speak in  different languages and have different goals, they all share the  syntaxes  of  software:  control  statements  “if  then”  and  “while  do,” operators and data types  such as characters and floating  point  numbers ,  data  structures  such  as  lists,  and  interface  conventions encompassing menus and dialog boxes.   If  electricity  and  the  combustion  engine  made  industrial  society  possible,  software  similarly  enables  global  information  society. The “knowledge workers,” the “symbol analysts,” the  “creative  industries,”  and  the  “service  industries”—none  of  these key economic players of the information society can exist  without software.   Examples are data visualization software used by a scientist,  spreadsheet  software  used  by  a  financial  analyst,  Web  design  software used by a designer working for a transnational adver- tising agency, or reservation software used by an airline. Software  is  what  also  drives  the  process  of  globalization,  allowing  companies  to  distribute  management  nodes,  production  facil- ities, and storage and consumption outputs around the world.  Regardless of which new dimension of contemporary existence a  particular social theory of the last few decades has focused on— information society, knowledge society, or network society—all  these new dimensions are enabled by software.    Paradoxically,  while  social  scientists,  philosophers,  cultural  critics, and media and new media theorists seem by now to cover  all aspects of IT revolution, creating a number of new disciplines  such as cyberculture studies, Internet studies, game studies, new  media theory, digital culture, and digital humanities, the under- lying engine which drives most of these subjects—software—has  received comparatively little attention.      INTRODUCTION    9  Even today, ten years later, when people are constantly interacting  with  and  updating  dozens  of  apps  on  their  mobile  phones  and  other computer devices, software as a theoretical category is still  invisible  to  most  academics,  artists,  and  cultural  professionals  interested in IT and its cultural and social effects.   There  are  some  important  exceptions.  One  is  the  open  source  movement  and  related  issues  around  copyright  and  IP  that  have  been extensively discussed in many academic disciplines. We also  see  a  steadily  growing  number  of  trade  books  about  Google,  Facebook, Amazon, eBay, Oracle, and other web giants. Some of  these books offer insightful discussions of the software developed  by these companies and the social, political, cognitive, and episte- mological effects of this software.  For a good example, see John  Battelle, The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules  of Business and Transformed Our Culture.6     So while we are in a better situation today when we put together  our  proposal  for  Software  Society  in  2003,  I  feel  that  it  is  still  meaningful  to  quote  it   the  only  additions  are  the  references  to  “social media” and “crowdsourcing” :   If we limit critical discussions of digital culture to the notions  of  “open  access,”  “peer  production,”  “cyber,”  “digital,”  “Internet,”  “networks,”  “new  media,”  or  “social  media,”  we  will never be able to get to what is behind new representational  and communication media and to understand what it really is  and what it does. If we don’t address software itself, we are in  danger  of  always  dealing  only  with  its  effects  rather  than  the  causes: the output that appears on a computer screen rather than  the  programs  and  social  cultures  that  produce  these  outputs.  “Information society,” “knowledge society,” “network society,”  “social  media,”  “online  collaboration,”  “crowdsourcing”— regardless  of  which  new  feature  of  contemporary  existence  a  particular  analysis  has  focused  on,  all  these  new  features  are  enabled by software. It is time we focused on software itself.   in  Noah  Wardrip-Fruin’s  A  similar  sentiment  Expressive  Processing   2009   when  he  says  in  relation  to  books   is  expressed     6 John  Battelle,  The  Search:  How  Google  and  Its  Rivals  Rewrote  the  Rules  of  Business and Transformed Our Culture  Portfolio Trade, 2006 .   10   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  about  digital  literature:  “almost  all  of  these  have  focused  on  what  the  machines  of  digital  media  look  like  from  the  outside:  their output… regardless of perspective, writings on digital media  almost all ignore something crucial: the actual processes that make  digital media work, the computational machines that make digital  media possible.”7 My book discusses what I take to be the key part  of these “machines” today  because it is the only part which most  users see and use directly : application software.  What is software studies?  This  book  aims  to  contribute  to  the  developing  intellectual  paradigm of “software studies.” What is software studies? Here  are  a  few  definitions.  The  first  comes  from  my  The  Language  of  New  Media,  where,  as  far  as  I  know,  the  terms  “software  studies”  and  “software  theory”  appeared  for  the  first  time.  I  wrote, “New media calls for a new stage in media theory whose  beginnings  can  be  traced  back  to  the  revolutionary  works  of  Robert  Innis  and  Marshall  McLuhan  of  the  1950s.  To  under- stand  the  logic  of  new  media  we  need  to  turn  to  computer  science.  It  is  there  that  we  may  expect  to  find  the  new  terms,  categories, and operations that characterize media that became  programmable.  From  media  studies,  we  move  to  something  which  can  be  called  software  studies;  from  media  theory—to  software theory.”    Reading  this  statement  today,  I  feel  some  adjustments  are  in  order.  It  positions  computer  science  as  a  kind  of  absolute  truth,  a  given  which  can  explain  to  us  how  culture  works  in  software  society. But computer science is itself part of culture. Therefore, I  think that Software Studies has to investigate the role of software  in contemporary culture, and the cultural and social forces that are  shaping the development of software itself.   The book that first comprehensively demonstrated the necessity  of the second approach was New Media Reader edited by Noah  Wardrip-Fruin  and  Nick  Montfort   The  MIT  Press,  2003 .  The  publication of this groundbreaking anthology laid the framework     7  Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Expressive Processing  Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2009 .      INTRODUCTION    11  for  the  historical  study  of  software  as  it  relates  to  the  history  of  culture.  Although  Reader  did  not  explicitly  use  the  term  “software studies,” it did propose a new model for how to think  about software. By systematically juxtaposing important texts by  pioneers  of  cultural  computing  and  artists  and  writers  active  in  the same historical periods, New Media Reader demonstrated that  both belonged to the same larger epistemes. That is, often the same  idea  was  simultaneously  articulated  independently  by  artists  and  scientists who were inventing cultural computing. For instance, the  anthology opens with a story by Jorge Borges  1941  and an article  by Vannevar Bush  1945  which both contain the idea of a massive  branching structure as a better way to organize data and to capture  human experience.   In  February  2006  Matthew  Fuller  who  had  already  published  a  pioneering  book  on  software  as  culture   Behind  the  Blip:  essays  on  the  culture  of  software,  2003   organized  the  very  first  Software Studies Workshop at Piet Zwart Institute in Rotterdam.  Introducing the workshop, Fuller wrote, “Software is often a blind  spot in the theorization and study of computational and networked  digital media. It is the very grounds and ‘stuff’ of media design. In a  sense, all intellectual work is now ‘software study’, in that software  provides  its  media  and  its  context,  but  there  are  very  few  places  where  the  specific  nature,  the  materiality,  of  software  is  studied  except as a matter of engineering.”8    I  completely  agree  with  Fuller  that,  “all  intellectual  work  is  now ‘software study.’” Yet it will take some time before the intel- lectuals will realize it. To help bring this change, in 2008, Matthew  Fuller, Noah Wardrip-Fruin and I established the Software Studies  book  series  at  MIT  Press.  The  already  published  books  in  the  series  are  Software  Studies:  A  Lexicon  edited  by  Fuller   2008 ,  Expressive  Processing:  Digital  Fictions,  Computer  Games,  and  Software  Studies  by  Wardrip-Fruin   2009 ,  Programmed  Visions:  Software and Memory by Wendy Hui Kyong Chun  2011 , Code  Space:  Software  and  Everyday  Life  by  Rob  Kitchin  and  Martin  Dodge   2011 ,  and  Speaking  Code:  Coding  as  Aesthetic  and  Political  Expression  by  Geoff  Cox  and  Alex  Mclean   2012 .  In  2011, Fuller together with a number of UK researchers established     8 http:  pzwart.wdka.hro.nl mdr Seminars2 softstudworkshop  January 21, 2008 .   12   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Computational Culture, an open-access peer-reviewed journal that  provides a platform for more publications and discussions.    In  addition  to  this  series,  I  am  also  happy  to  see  a  growing  number  of  other  titles  written  from  the  perspectives  of  platform  studies,  digital  humanities,  cyberculture,  internet  studies,  and  game  studies.  Many  of  these  books  contain  important  insights  and  discussions  which  help  us  better  understand  the  roles  of  software.  Rather  than  trying  to  list  all  of  them,  I  will  only  provide  a  few  examples  of  works  which  exemplify  the  first  two  of  these  perspectives   more  will  be  in  press  by  the  time  you  are  reading  this .

This book is organized around the key  insight that computers and software are not just “technology” but  rather the new medium in which we can think and imagine differ- ently.  Similar  understanding  was  shared  by  all  the  heroes  of  this  book  who,  with  their  collaborators,  invented  the  computational  “tools  for  thoughts”—J.  C.  R.  Licklider,  Ted  Nelson,  Douglass  Engelbart,  Bob  Taylor,  Alan  Kay,  Nicholas  Negroponte.   Today  many  academics  in  humanities  and  social  sciences  still  need  to  grasp this simple but fundamental idea. They continue to think of  software as being strictly the domain of the Academic Computing  Department in their universities—something which is only there to  help them become more efficient, as opposed to the medium where  human intellectual creativity now dwells.    This short sketch of the intellectual landscape around software  studies  will  be  very  incomplete  if  I  do  not  mention  the  role  of  artists in pioneering the cultural discussions of software. Beginning  around  2000,  a  number  of  artists  and  writers  started  to  develop  the practice of software art which included exhibitions, festivals,  publishing  books,  and  organizing  online  repositories  of  relevant  works. The key figures in these developments were Amy Alexander,   11 Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon, Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of  The Internet  Simon & Schuster, 1998 ; Michael A.

In  2002  Christiane  Paul  organized  CODeDOC—an  exhibition  of  artistic  code—at  The  Whitney  Museum of American Art;12 in 2003, the major festival of digital  art  Ars  Electronica  choose  “Code”  as  its  topic;  and  since  2001,  the  transmediale  festival  has  included  “artistic  software”  as  one  of its categories, and devoted a significant space to it in the festi- val’s symposiums. Some of the software art projects pioneered the  examination of code as the new cultural and social artifact; others  offered critical commentary on commercial software practices. For  example,  Adrian  Ward  created  an  ironic  Auto-Illustrator—“an  experimental, semi-autonomous, generative software artwork and  a fully functional vector graphic design application to sit alongside  your existing professional graphic design utilities.”   Recognizing that the bits of software studies exist across many  books and art projects, Fuller writes in the Foreword to The MIT  Press Software Studies book series:   Software  is  deeply  woven  into  contemporary  life—economically,  culturally,  creatively,  politically—in  manners  both  obvious  and  nearly  invisible.  Yet  while  much  is  written  about  how  software  is  used,  and  the  activities  that  it  supports  and  shapes,  thinking  about software itself has remained largely technical for much of its  history. Increasingly, however, artists, scientists, engineers, hackers,  designers,  and  scholars  in  the  humanities  and  social  sciences  are  finding that for the questions they face, and the things they need to  build, an expanded understanding of software is necessary. For such  understanding they can call upon a strand of texts in the history of  computing and new media, they can take part in the rich implicit  culture of software, and they also can take part in the development  of  an  emerging,  fundamentally  transdisciplinary,  computational  literacy. These provide the foundation for Software Studies.13   Indeed, a number of earlier works by the leading media theorists  of our times—Friedrich A. Kittler, Peter Weibel, Katherine Hayles,   12 http:  artport.whitney.org commissions codedoc  13 Matthew  Fuller,  Software  Studies  series  introduction,  http:  mitpress.mit.edu  catalog browse browse.asp?btype=6&serid=179  July 14, 2011 .      INTRODUCTION    15  Lawrence Lessig, Manual Castells, Alex Galloway, and others—can  also be retroactively identified as belonging to software studies.14  Therefore, I strongly believe that this paradigm has already existed  for a number of years but it has not been explicitly named until a  few years ago.    In  his  introduction  to  a  2006  Rotterdam  workshop  Fuller  pointed out that “software can be seen as an object of study and  an area of practice for art and design theory and the humanities,  for  cultural  studies  and  science  and  technology  studies  and  for  an  emerging  reflexive  strand  of  computer  science.”  Since  a  new  academic discipline can be defined either through a unique object  of  study,  a  new  research  method,  or  a  combination  of  the  two,  how shall we think of software studies? Fuller’s statement implies  that “software” is a new object of study which should be put on  the agenda of existing disciplines and which can be studied using  already  existing  methods—for  instance,  actor-network  theory,  social semiotics, or media archaeology.    There are good reasons for supporting this perspective. I think  of  software  as  a  layer  that  permeates  all  areas  of  contemporary  societies.  Therefore,  if  we  want  to  understand  contemporary  techniques of control, communication, representation, simulation,  analysis, decision-making, memory, vision, writing, and interaction,  our  analysis  cannot  be  complete  until  we  consider  this  software  layer.  Which  means  that  all  disciplines  which  deal  with  contem- porary  society  and  culture—architecture,  design,  art  criticism,  sociology, political science, art history, media studies, science and  technology studies, and all others—need to account for the role of  software and its effects in whatever subjects they investigate.   At the same time, the existing work in software studies already  demonstrates  that  if  we  are  to  focus  on  software  itself,  we  need  new  methodologies.  That  is,  it  helps  to  practice  what  one  writes  about. It is not accidental that all the intellectuals who have most  systematically written about software’s roles in society and culture  have  either  programmed  themselves  or  have  been  involved  in  cultural projects and practices which include writing and teaching  software—for  instance,  Ian  Bogost,  Jay  Bolter,  Florian  Cramer,  Wendy  Chun,  Matthew  Fuller,  Alexander  Galloway,  Katherine   14 See  Michael  Truscello,  review  of  “Behind  the  Blip:  Essays  on  the  Culture  of  Software,” Cultural Critique 63, Spring 2006, pp. 182–7.   16   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Hayles,  Matthew  Kirschenbaum,  Geert  Lovink,  Peter  Lunenfeld,  Adrian  Mackenzie,  Paul  D.  Miller,  William  J.  Mitchell,  Nick  Montfort, Janet Murray, Katie Salen, Bruce Sterling, Noah Wardrip- Fruin,  and  Eric  Zimmerman.  In  contrast,  the  scholars  without  this  technical  experience  or  involvement—for  example,  Manual  Castells, Bruno Latour, Paul Virilio, and Siegfried Zielinski—have  not  included  discussions  of  software  in  their  otherwise  theoreti- cally precise and highly influential accounts of modern media and  technology.    In the 2000s, the number of students in media art, design, archi- tecture, and humanities who use programming or scripting in their  work has grown substantially—at least in comparison with 1999  when I first mentioned “software studies” in The Language of New  Media.  Outside  of  culture  and  academic  industries,  many  more  people today are also writing software. To a significant extent, this  is the result of new programming and scripting languages such as  ActionScript, PHP, Perl, Python, and Processing. Another important  factor is the publication of APIs by all major Web 2.0 companies  in  the  middle  of  the  2000s.   API,  or  Application  Programming  Interface,  is  a  code  that  allows  other  computer  programs  to  access services offered by an application. For instance, people can  use  Google  Maps  API  to  embed  full  Google  Maps  on  their  own  websites.   These  programming  and  scripting  languages  and  APIs  did  not  necessarily  make  programming  easier.  Rather,  they  made  it  much  more  efficient.  For  instance,  since  a  young  designer  can  create an interesting work with only couple of dozen lines of code  written  in  Processing  versus  writing  a  really  long  Java  program,  s he is much more likely to take up programming. Similarly, if only  a few lines in JavaScript allows you to integrate all the functionality  offered by Google Maps into your site, this is a great motivation  for  beginning  to  work  with  JavaScript.  Yet  another  reason  for  more people writing software today is the emergence of a massive  mobile  apps  marketplace  that,  unlike  the  desktop  market,  is  not  dominated  by  a  few  large  companies.  According  to  informal  reports in the beginning of 2012, one million programmers were  creating  apps  for  the  iOS  platform   iPad  and  iPhone   alone,  and  another one million were doing this for the Android platform.    In his 2006 article covering new technologies that allow people  with  very  little  or  no  programming  experience  to  create  new  custom software  such as Ning , Martin LaMonica wrote about a       INTRODUCTION    17  future possibility of “a long tail for apps.”15 A few years later, this  is exactly what happened. In September 2012, 700,000 apps were  available on Apple App Store,16 and over 600,000 Android apps on  Google Play.17    In  the  article  called  “A  Surge  in  Learning  the  Language  of  the  Internet”   March  27,  2012 ,  the  New  York  Times  reported  that,  “The  market  for  night  classes  and  online  instruction  in  programming  and  Web  construction,  as  well  as  for  iPhone  apps  that  teach,  is  booming.”  The  article  quoted  Zach  Sims,  one  of  the  founders  of  Codecademy   a  web  school  which  teaches  programming though interactive lessons  who explained one of the  reasons for this growing interest in learning programming and web  design: “People have a genuine desire to understand the world we  now live in. They do not just want to use the Web; they want to  understand how it works.”18 In  spite  of  these  impressive  developments,  the  gap  between    people  who  can  program  and  who  cannot  remains—as  does  the  gap  between  professional  programmers  and  people  who  just  took  one  or  two  short  programming  classes.  Clearly,  today  the  consumer technologies for capturing and editing media are much  easier  to  use  than  even  the  most  friendly  programming  and  scripting  languages.  But  it  does  not  necessarily  have  to  stay  this  way. Think, for instance, of what it took to set up a photo studio  and take photographs in the 1850s versus simply pressing a single  button on a digital camera or a mobile phone in the 2000s. Clearly,  we are very far from such simplicity in programming. But I do not  see any logical reasons why programming cannot one day become  equally easy.   For  now,  the  number  of  people  who  can  script  and  program  keeps  increasing.  Although  we  are  far  from  a  true  “long  tail”  for  software,  software  development  is  gradually  getting  more  democratized. It is, therefore, the right moment to start thinking   15 Martin LaMonica, “The do-it-yourself Web emerges,” CNET News, July 31, 2006,  http:  www.news.com The-do-it-yourself-Web-emerges 2100-1032_3-6099965. html 16 http:  www.mobilestatistics.com mobile-statistics  July 30, 2012 . 17 http:  play.google.com about apps   July 30, 2012 .  18 Jenna Wortham, “A Surge in Learning the Language of the Internet,” New York  Times,  March  27,  2012,  http:  www.nytimes.com 2012 03 28 technology for-an- edge-on-the-internet-computer-code-gains-a-following.html   18   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  The complete code for tree_recursion, a Processing sketch by Mitchell  Whitelaw, 2011, http:  www.openprocessing.org sketch 8752      INTRODUCTION    19  Tree variations generated by tree_recursion code.   20   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  theoretically about how software is shaping our culture, and how  it is shaped by culture in its turn. The time for “software studies”  has arrived.  Cultural software  German  media  and  literary  theorist  Friedrich  Kittler  wrote  that  students  today  should  know  at  least  two  software  languages:  only  “then  they’ll  be  able  to  say  something  about  what  ‘culture’  is at the moment.”19 Kittler himself programmed in an assembler  language—which  probably  determined  his  distrust  of  Graphical  User  Interfaces  and  modern  software  applications  that  use  these  interfaces.  In  a  classical  modernist  move,  Kittler  argued  that  we  need to focus on the “essence” of the computer—which for Kittler  meant  its  mathematical  and  logical  foundations  and  its  early  history characterized by tools such as assembler languages.    This book is determined by my own history of engagement with  computers  as  a  programmer,  computer  animator  and  designer,  media artist, and as a teacher. This involvement started in the early  1980s, which was the decade of procedural programming  Pascal ,  rather  than  assembly  programming.  It  was  also  the  decade  that  saw  the  introduction  of  PCs,  the  emergence  and  popularization  of  desktop  publishing,  and  the  use  of  hypertext  by  some  literary  scholars.  In  fact,  I  came  to  NYC  from  Moscow  in  1981,  which  was  the  year  IBM  introduced  their  first  PC.  My  first  experience  with  computer  graphics  was  in  1983–4  on  Apple  IIe.  In  1984  I  saw  a  Graphical  User  Interface  in  its  first  successful  commercial  implementation on an Apple Macintosh. The same year I got a job  at Digital Effects, one of the first computer animation companies in  the world, where I learned how to program 3D computer models  and  animations.  In  1986  I  was  writing  computer  programs  that  automatically  processed  photographs  to  make  them  look  like  paintings.  In  January  1987  Adobe  Systems  shipped  Illustrator,   19 Friedrich Kittler, ‘Technologies of Writing Rewriting Technology,’ Auseinander 1,  no. 3  Berlin, 1995 , quoted in Michael Truscello, “The Birth of Software Studies:  Lev  Manovich  and  Digital  Materialism,”  Film-Philosophy  7,  no.  55   December  2003 , http:  www.film-philosophy.com vol7-2003 n55truscello.html      INTRODUCTION    21  followed  by  Photoshop  in  1989.  The  same  year  saw  the  release  of  The  Abyss,  directed  by  James  Cameron.  This  movie  used  pioneering CGI to create the first complex virtual character. And,  by Christmas of 1990, Tim Berners-Lee had already created all the  components of the World Wide Web as it exists today: a web server,  web pages, and a web browser.   In short, during one decade the computer moved from being a  culturally invisible technology to being the new engine of culture.  While  the  progress  in  hardware  and  Moore’s  Law  played  crucial  roles  in  this  development,  even  more  crucial  was  the  release  of  software  with  a  Graphical  User  Interface   GUI   aimed  at  non-technical  users,  word  processing,  applications  for  drawing,  painting, 3D modeling, animation, music composing and editing,  information  management,  hypermedia  and  multimedia  authoring   HyperCard, Director , and global networking  World Wide Web   With easy-to-use software in place, the stage was set for the next  decade of the 1990s when most culture industries—graphic design,  architecture, product design, space design, filmmaking, animation,  media design, music, higher education, and culture management— gradually adapted software tools. Thus, although I first learned to  program in 1975 when I was in high school in Moscow, my take  on software studies has been shaped by watching how during the  1980s GUI-based software quickly put the computer in the center  of culture.    If  software  is  indeed  the  contemporary  equivalent  of  the  combustion  engine  and  electricity  in  terms  of  its  social  effects,  every type of software needs to be taken into account. We need to  consider not only “visible” software used by consumers but also  “grey” software, which runs all systems and processes in contem- porary society. However, since I do not have personal experience  writing  logistics  software,  industrial  automation  software,  and  other “grey” software, I will be not be writing about such topics.  My  concern  is  with  a  particular  subset  of  software  which  I  used  and taught in my professional life. I call it cultural software.    While  the  term  “cultural  software”  was  previously  used  metaphorically  see J. M. Balkin, Cultural Software: A Theory of  Ideology,  2003 ,  I  am  going  to  use  it  literally  to  refer  to  certain  types  of  software  that  support  actions  we  normally  associate  with “culture.” These cultural actions enabled by software can be  divided into a number of categories  of course we should keep in    22   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Adobe Photoshop, Macintosh version 1.0.7, 1990.

INTRODUCTION    23  mind  that  this  is  just  one  possible  specific  categorization  system  among many .  1  Creating cultural artifacts and interactive services which   contain representations, ideas, beliefs, and aesthetic values   for instance, editing a music video, designing a package for  a product, designing a website or an app .  2  Accessing, appending, sharing, and remixing such artifacts   or their parts  online  for instance, reading newspaper on  the web, watching YouTube video, adding comments to a  blog post .  3  Creating and sharing information and knowledge online   for instance, editing a Wikipedia article, adding places in  Google Earth, including a link in a tweet .   4  Communicating with other people using email, instant   message, voice-over IP, online text and video chat, social  networking features such as wall postings, pokes, events,  photo tags, notes, places, etc.   5  Engaging in interactive cultural experiences  for instance,   playing a computer game .  6  Participating in the online information ecology by   expressing preferences and adding metadata  for instance,  automatically generating new information for Google  Search whenever you use this service; clicking the “+1”  button on Google+ or the “Like” button on Facebook;  using the “retweet” function on Twitter .   7  Developing software tools and services that support all  these activities  for instance, programming a library for  Processing that enables sending and receiving data over the  Internet;20 writing a new plugin for Photoshop, creating a  new theme for WordPress .  Technically, this software may be implemented in a variety of ways.  Popular implementations  referred to in the computer industry as  “software architecture”  include stand-alone applications that run  on  the  user’s  computing  device,  distributed  applications   a  client   20 http:  www.processing.org reference libraries   July 7, 2011 .   24   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  running  on  the  user’s  device  communicates  with  software  on  the  server ,  and  peer-to-peer  networks   each  computer  becomes  both  a client and a server . If all this sounds completely unfamiliar, do  not worry: all you need to understand is that “cultural software”  as I will use this term covers a wide range of products and network  services,  as  opposed  to  only  single  desktop  applications  such  as  Illustrator,  Photoshop  or  After  Effects  that  dominated  media  authoring  in  the  1990s  and  2000s.  For  example,  social  network  services such as Facebook and Twitter include multiple programs  and databases running on company servers  for instance, in 2007  Google  was  running  over  one  million  servers  around  the  world  according  to  one  estimate21   and  the  programs   called  “clients”   used by people to send emails, chat, post updates, upload video,  leave  comments,  and  perform  other  tasks  on  these  services.   For  instance,  one  can  access  Twitter  using  twitter.com,  or  tweetdeck. com,  Twitter  apps  for  iOS,  Android,  and  dozens  of  third  party  websites and apps.   Media applications  Let us go through the software categories that support the first four  types of cultural activities listed above in more detail.    The first category is software for creating, editing, and organizing  media  content.  The  examples  are  Microsoft  Word,  PowerPoint,  Photoshop,  Illustrator,  InDesign,  Final  Cut,  After  Effects,  Maya,  Blender,  Dreamweaver,  Aperture,  and  other  applications.  This  category is in the center of this book. The industry uses a number  of  terms  to  refer  to  this  category  such  as  “media  authoring,”  “media editing,” and “media development” but I am going to refer  to this category by using a single summary term. I will simply call  it media software.   The second category is software for distributing, accessing, and  combining   or  “publishing,”  “sharing,”  and  “remixing”   media  content on the web. Think Firefox, Chrome, Blogger, WordPress,  Tumblr,  Pinterest,  Gmail,  Google  Maps,  YouTube,  Vimeo  and   21 Pandia Search & Social, “Google: one million servers and counting,” http:  www. pandia.com sew 481-gartner.html      INTRODUCTION    25  other web applications and services. Obviously, the first and second  categories overlap—for example, many desktop media applications  allow  you  to  upload  your  creations  directly  to  popular  media  sharing  sites,  while  many  web  applications  and  services  include  some authoring and editing functions  for example, YouTube has  a built-in video editor . And blogging platforms and email clients  sit right in the middle—they are used as much for publishing as for  creating new content.    I will take for granted that since we all use application programs,  or “apps,” we have a basic understanding of this term. Similarly, I  also assume that we understand what “content” refers to in digital  culture,  but  just  to  be  sure,  here  are  a  couple  of  ways  to  define  it.  We  can  simply  list  various  types  of  media  which  are  created,  shared, and accessed with media software and the tools provided  by social media and sites: texts, images, digital video, animations,  3D objects and scenes, maps, as well as various combinations of  these and other media. Alternatively, we can define “content” by  listing genres, for instance, web pages, tweets, Facebook updates,  casual  games,  multiplayer  online  games,  user-generated  video,  search engine results, URLs, map locations, shared bookmarks, etc.    Digital culture tends to modularize content, i.e., enabling users  to create, distribute, and re-use discrete content elements—looping  animations  to  be  used  as  backgrounds  for  videos,  3D  objects  to  be used in creating complex 3D animations, pieces of code to be  used  in  websites  and  blogs,  etc.16   This  modularity  parallels  the  fundamental  principle  of  modern  software  engineering  to  design  computer programs from small reusable parts called functions or  procedures.  All such parts also qualify as “content.”   Between  the  late  1970s  and  the  middle  of  the  2000s,  appli- cation  programs  for  media  editing  were  designed  to  run  on  a  user’s computer  minicomputers, PCs, scientific workstations, and  later, laptops . In the next five years, companies gradually created  more  and  more  capable  versions  of  these  programs  running  in  the “cloud.” Some of these programs are available via their own  websites   Google  Docs,  Microsoft  Web  Office ,  while  others  are  integrated  with  media  hosting  or  social  media  services   e.g.,  Photobucket  image  and  video  editor .  Many  applications  are  implemented  as  clients  that  run  on  mobile  phones   e.g.,  Maps  on  iPhone ,  tablets,  and  TV  platforms  and  communicate  with  servers and websites. Examples of such platforms are Apple’s iOS,    26   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Google’s Android, and LG’s Smart TV App platform. Still others  are apps running on tablets such as Adobe Photoshop Touch for  iPad.22   While  at  the  moment  of  writing  both  web-based  and  mobile applications have limited editing capabilities in comparison  with their desktop counterparts, this may already have changed by  the time you are reading this book .   The  development  of  mobile  software  platforms  led  to  the  increasing  importance  of  certain  media  application  types   and  corresponding cultural activities  such as “media uploaders”  apps  designed for uploading media content to media sharing sites . To  put this differently, managing media content  for example, organ- izing photos in Picasa  and also “meta-managing”  i.e. managing  the  systems  which  manage  it  such  as  organizing  a  blogroll   have  become as central to a person’s cultural life as creating this content.    This book is about media software—its conceptual history, the  ways  it  redefined  the  practice  of  media  design,  the  aesthetics  of  the media being created, and creators’ and users’ understanding of  “media.” How can we place media software inside other categories  and  also  break  it  into  smaller  categories?  Let  us  start  again  with  our  definition,  which  I  will  rephrase  here.  Media  software  are  programs  that  are  used  to  create  and  interact  with  media  objects and environments. It is a subset of the larger category of  “application software”—the term which is itself in the process of  changing its meaning as desktop applications  applications which  run on a computer  are supplemented by mobile apps  applications  running  on  mobile  devices   and  web  applications   applications  which  consist  of  a  web  client  and  the  software  running  on  a  server .  Media  software  enables  creation,  publishing,  accessing,  sharing,  and  remixing  different  types  of  media   such  as  images,  moving image sequences, 3D shapes, characters, and spaces, text,  maps, interactive elements , as well as various projects and services  which  use  these  elements.  These  projects  can  be  non-interactive   2D  designs,  motion  graphics,  film  shots   or  interactive   media  surfaces  and  other  interactive  installations .  The  online  services  are by their very nature always interactive  websites, blogs, social  networks, social media services, games, wikis, web media and app  stores such as Google Play and Apple iTunes, other shopping sites,   22 http:  www.adobe.com products mobileapps   March 12, 2012 .      INTRODUCTION    27  and so on —while a user is not always given the ability to add to  or  modify  content,  s he  always  navigates  and  interacts  with  the  existing content using interactive interface.   Given  that  today  the  multi-billion  global  culture  industry  is  enabled  by  media  applications,  it  is  interesting  that  there  is  no  single  accepted  way  to  classify  them.  The  Wikipedia  article  on  “application  software”  includes  the  categories  of  “media  devel- opment software” and “content access software”  divided into web  browsers, media players, and presentation applications .23 This is  generally  useful  but  not  completely  accurate—since  today  most  “content access software” also includes at least some media editing  functions.  For  example,  the  SeaMonkey  browser  from  Mozilla  Foundation includes an HTML editor;24 QuickTime Player can be  used  to  cut  and  paste  parts  of  video;  iPhoto  supports  a  number  of  photo  editing  operations.  Conversely,  in  most  cases  “media  development”   or  “content  creation”   software  such  as  Word  or  PowerPoint  is  used  to  both  develop  and  access  content.   This  co-existence  of  authoring  and  access  functions  is  an  important  distinguishing feature of software culture.  If we visit the websites  of  popular  makers  of  these  software  applications  such  as  Adobe  and Autodesk, we will find that these companies may break their  products  by  market   web,  broadcast,  architecture,  and  so  on   or  use sub-categories such as “consumer” and “pro.” This is as good  as  it  gets—another  reason  why  we  should  focus  our  theoretical  tools on interrogating media software.   While  I  will  focus  on  media  applications  for  creating  and  accessing  “content”   i.e.  media  artifacts ,  cultural  software  also  includes  tools  and  services  that  are  specifically  designed  for  communication  and  sharing  of  information  and  knowledge,  i.e.  “social  software”   categories  3–4  in  my  list .  The  examples  include search engines, web browsers, blog editors, email applica- tions,  instant  messaging  applications,  wikis,  social  bookmarking,  social  networks,  virtual  worlds,  and  prediction  markets.  The  familiar  names  include  Facebook,  the  family  of  Google  products   Google Web search, Gmail, Google Maps, Google+, etc. , Skype,  MediaWiki, and Blogger. However, since at the end of the 2000s,  numerous software apps and services started to include email, post,   23 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Application_software 24 http:  www.seamonkey-project.org    28   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  and  chat  functions   often  via  a  dedicated  “Share”  menu ,  to  an  extent, all software became social software.    Of course, people do not share everything online with others— at  least,  not  yet  and  not  everybody.  Therefore,  we  should  also  include software tools for personal information management such  as project managers, database applications, and simple text editors  or note-taking apps that are included with every computer device  being sold.    These and all other categories of software shift over time. For  instance, during the 2000s the boundary between “personal infor- mation” and “public information” has been reconfigured as people  started to routinely place their media on media sharing sites, and  also communicate with others on social networks.  In fact, the whole reason behind the existence of social media    and social networking services and hosting websites is to erase this  boundary  as  much  as  possible.  By  encouraging  users  to  conduct  larger  parts  of  their  social  and  cultural  lives  on  their  sites,  these  services  can  both  sell  more  ads  to  more  people  and  ensure  the  continuous growth of their user base. With more of your friends  using  a  particular  service  and  offering  more  information,  media,  and discussions there, you are more likely to also join that service.   As many of these services began to offer more and more advanced  media editing and information management tools along with their  original media hosting and communication and social networking  functions, they did manage to largely erase another set of boundaries   from the PC era : those between application programs, operating  system,  and  data.  Facebook  in  particular  was  very  aggressive  in  positioning itself as a complete “social platform” which can replace  various stand-alone communication programs and services.   Until  the  rise  of  social  media  and  the  proliferation  of  mobile  media  platforms,  it  was  possible  to  study  media  production,  dissemination,  and  consumption  as  separate  processes.  Similarly,  we  could  usually  separate  production  tools,  distribution  technol- ogies,  and  media  access  devices  and  platforms—for  example,  the  TV  studio,  cameras,  lighting,  and  editing  machines   production ,  transmission  systems   distribution ,  and  television  sets   access .  Social  media  and  cloud  computing  in  general  erase  these  bound- aries  in  many  cases  and  at  the  same  time  introduce  new  ones   client server, open access commercial . The challenge of software  studies is to be able to use terms such as “content” and “software       INTRODUCTION    29  application” while always keeping in mind that the current social  media cloud computing paradigms are systematically reconfiguring  the meaning of these terms.    Since creation of interactive media often involves writing some  original computer code, the programming environments also can be  considered under cultural software. Moreover, the media interfaces  themselves—icons, folders, sounds, animations, vibrating surfaces,  and touch screens—are also cultural software, since these interfaces  mediate people’s interactions with media and other people. I will  stop here but this list can easily be extended to include additional  categories of software as well.    The  interface  category  is  particularly  important  for  this  book.  I  am  interested  in  how  software  appears  to  users—i.e.  what  functions it offers to create, share, reuse, mix, create, manage, share  and  communicate  content,  the  interfaces  used  to  present  these  functions, and assumptions and models about a user, her his needs,  and society encoded in these functions and their interface design.    These  functions  offered  by  an  application  are  embedded  in  application  commands  and  tools.  They  define  what  you  can  do  with  a  given  app,  and  how  you  can  do  it.  This  is  clear;  but  I  need to make one important point about interfaces to avoid any  confusion.  Many  people  still  think  that  contemporary  computer  devices use a Graphical User Interface  GUI . In reality, the original  GUI of the early 1980s  icons, folders, menus  has been gradually  extended to include other media and senses  sounds, animations,  and vibration feedback which may accompany user interactions on  a  mobile  device,  voice  input,  multi-touch  gesture  interfaces,  etc.   This is why the term “media interface”  used in the industry  is a  more accurate description of how interfaces work today. The term  accurately describes interfaces of computer operating systems such  as Windows and Mac OS, and mobile OS such Android and iOS; it  is even applicable to interfaces of game consoles and mobile phones,  as well as interactive stores25 or museum installations which use all  types of media besides graphics to communicate with the users.26  25 For examples, see Nanika’s projects for Nokia and Diesel, http:  www.nanikawa. com ; Audi City in London, opened 2012.  26 For  example,  see  interactive  installations  at  the  Nobel  Peace  Center  in  Oslo:  Nobel  Chamber,  Nobel  Field,  and  Nobel  Electronic  Wall  Papers,  http:  www. nobelpeacecenter.org en exhibitions peace-prize-laureates    30   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  I also need to comment on the “media content” vs. “data infor-   mation knowledge” categories used to organize my list of types of  cultural software above. As with many other categories that I will  use in this book, I think of them as marking the two parts of the  same continuous dimension rather than as being discrete either or  boxes. A feature film is a good example of the first category, and  an Excel spreadsheet represents the second category—but between  such  clear-cut  examples,  there  are  numerous  other  cases  which  are both. For example, if I make an information visualization of  the data in the spreadsheet, this visualization now fits equally into  both  categories.  It  is  still  “data,”  but  data  represented  in  a  new  way which allows us to arrive at insights and “knowledge.” It also  becomes a piece of visual media which appeals to our senses in the  same way as photographs and paintings do.   The  reason  that  our  society  places  these  two  sets  of  terms  in  opposition  has  to  do  with  the  histories  of  the  media  and  infor- mation industries. Modern “media” is the result of the technologies  and  institutions  which  developed  between  the  second  half  of  the  eighteenth  and  first  half  of  the  twentieth  centuries:  large-scale  newspaper, magazine and book publishing, photography, cinema,  radio,  television  and  the  record  industry.  “Data”  comes  from  a  number of separate professional fields with distinct histories: social  statistics, economics, business management, and financial markets.  It is only in the beginning of the twenty-first century that data leaves  professional domains to become of interest to society at large. Data  becomes “sexy” and “hip,” with governments and cities creating  their  own  data  portals   for  example,  data.gov  and  data.gov.uk ,  visualizations of data entering exhibitions of major museums such  as MOMA  Design and Elastic Mind, 2008 , the computer “nerds”  becoming  heroes  of  Hollywood  films   Social  Network,  2010 ,  and Google Analytics, Facebook, YouTube and Flickr all offering  detailed  data  about  your  website  or  media  sharing  account.  Of  course,  since  media  software  operations   as  well  as  any  other  computer processing of media for research, commercial or artistic  purposes  are only possible because the computer represents media  as  data   discrete  elements  such  as  pixels,  or  equations  defining  vector  graphics  in  vector  files  such  as  EPS ,  the  development  of  media  software  and  its  adoption  as  the  key  media  technology   discussed in this book  is an important contributor to the gradual  coming together of media and data.       INTRODUCTION    31    Software  includes  many  other  technologies  and  types,  and  computers and computer devices also perform lots of other functions  besides creating and playing media. And of course, software needs  hardware  to  run;  and  networks  are  also  an  essential  part  of  our  digital  culture.  Therefore,  my  focus  on  software  applications  for  creating, editing, and playing media is likely to annoy some people.  Not everybody uses Photoshop, Flash, Maya, and other applications  to create media. A significant number of people work with media  by writing their own computer programs and scripts, or modifying  programs  written  by  others.  These  are  programmers  responsible  for the coding of websites, web applications, and other interactive  applications, software artists, computer scientists working on the  development  of  new  algorithms,  students  using  Processing  and  other high-level media programming languages, and other groups.  All of them may ask me why I single out software in the form of  consumer products  i.e. applications —as opposed to the activity of  programming?  And  what  about  the  gradual  democratization  of  software  development  and  the  gradual  increase  in  the  number  of  culture  professionals  and  students  who  can  program  or  write  scripts? Should I not put my energy into promoting programming  rather than explaining applications?   The reason for my choice is my commitment to understand the  mainstream cultural practices rather than to emphasize  as many  cultural critics do  the exceptions, no matter how progressive they  may  be.  Although  we  do  not  have  an  exact  number,  I  assume  that the number of people who work in media and who can also  program  is  tiny  in  comparison  to  the  army  of  application  users.  Today, a typical professional graphic designer, film editor, product  designer,  architect,  music  artist—and  certainly  a  typical  person  uploading videos to YouTube or adding photos and video on her  his blog—can neither write nor read software code.  Being able to  read  and  modify  HTML  markup,  or  copy  already  pre-packaged  lines  of  Javascript  code  is  very  different  from  programming.   Therefore,  if  we  want  to  understand  how  software  has  already  re-shaped  media  both  conceptually  and  practically,  we  have  to  take a close look at the everyday tools used by the great majority  of  both  professional  and  non-professional  users—i.e.  application  software, web-based software, and, of course, mobile apps.  This  book highlights the first category at the expense of the second and  the third—because at this point, creation of professional media still    32   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  requires applications running on a laptop or desktop, often with a  significant amount of RAM and large hard drives; and also because  currently  web-based  and  mobile  software  are  still  evolving  quite  rapidly in contrast to desktop applications such as Photoshop and  Final Cut which change only incrementally from release to release .    Any  definition  is  likely  to  delight  some  people  and  to  annoy  others.  Therefore,  I  also  would  like  to  address  another  likely  objection to the way I defined the term “cultural software”  with  “media  software”  being  its  subset .  The  term  “culture”  is  not  reducible to separate media and design “objects” which may exist  as files on a computer and or as executable software programs or  scripts.  It  includes  symbols,  meanings,  values,  language,  habits,  beliefs,  ideologies,  rituals,  religion,  dress  and  behavioral  codes,  and many other material and immaterial elements and dimensions.  Consequently, cultural anthropologists, linguists, sociologists, and  many  humanists  may  be  annoyed  at  what  may  appear  as  an  uncritical  reduction  of  all  these  dimensions  to  a  set  of  tools  for  creating and playing media files.    Am  I  saying  that  today  “culture”  is  equated  with  a  particular  subset of application software and the media objects and experi- ences that can be created with their help? Of course not. However,  what I am saying—and what I hope this book explicates in more  detail—is  that  at  the  end  of  the  twentieth  century  humans  have  added a fundamentally new dimension to everything that counts as  “culture.” This dimension is software in general, and application  software for creating and accessing content in particular.    I am using the metaphor of a new dimension on purpose. That  is,  “cultural  software”  is  not  simply  a  new  object—no  matter  how  large  and  important—which  has  been  dropped  into  the  space  which  we  call  “culture.”  Thus,  it  would  be  imprecise  to  think  of  software  as  simply  another  term  which  we  can  add  to  the  set  which  includes  music,  visual  design,  built  spaces,  dress  codes,  languages,  food,  club  cultures,  corporate  norms,  ways  of  talking and using a body, and so on. And while we can certainly  study  “the  culture  of  software”—programming  practices,  values  and  ideologies  of  programmers  and  software  companies,  the  cultures of Silicon Valley and Bangalore, etc.—if we only do this,  we  will  miss  the  real  importance  of  software.  Like  the  alphabet,  mathematics,  printing  press,  combustion  engine,  electricity,  and  integrated circuits, software re-adjusts and re-shapes everything it       INTRODUCTION    33  is applied to—or at least, it has a potential to do this. Just as adding  a new dimension adds a new coordinate to every point in space,  “adding”  software  to  culture  changes  the  identity  of  everything  that a culture is made from.  In this respect, software is a perfect  example of what McLuhan meant when he wrote, the ‘message of  any medium or technology is the change of scale or pace or pattern  that it introduces into human affairs.”27    To  summarize:  our  contemporary  society  can  be  characterized  as  a  software  society  and  our  culture  can  be  justifiably  called  a  software  culture—because  today  software  plays  a  central  role  in  shaping  both  the  material  elements  and  many  of  the  immaterial  structures that together make up “culture.”   From documents to performances  The  use  of  software  re-configures  most  basic  social  and  cultural  practices  and  makes  us  rethink  the  concepts  and  theories  we  developed to describe them. As one example of this, consider the  modern  “atom”  of  cultural  creation,  transmission,  and  memory:  a  “document,”  i.e.  some  content  stored  in  a  physical  form,  that  is  delivered  to  consumers  via  physical  copies   books,  films,  audio  record ,  or  electronic  transmission   television .  In  software  culture,  we  no  longer  have  “documents,”  “works,”  “messages”  or  “recordings”  in  twentieth-century  terms.  Instead  of  fixed  documents that could be analyzed by examining their structure and  content  a typical move of the twentieth-century cultural analysis  and  theory,  from  Russian  Formalism  to  Literary  Darwinism ,  we  now  interact  with  dynamic  “software  performances.”  I  use  the  word  “performance”  because  what  we  are  experiencing  is  constructed by software in real time. So whether we are exploring  a  dynamic  website,  playing  a  video  game,  or  using  an  app  on  a  mobile  phone  to  locate  particular  places  or  friends  nearby,  we  are  engaging  not  with  pre-defined  static  documents  but  with  the  dynamic  outputs  of  a  real-time  computation  happening  on  our   27 Marshall McLuhan, Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man  New York:  McGraw Hill, 1964 , quoted in New Media Reader, Noah Wardrip-Fruin and Nick  Montfort  eds   The MIT Press, 2003 , p. 203.   34   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  device  and or  the  server.  Computer  programs  can  use  a  variety  of  components  to  create  these  performances:  design  templates,  files stored on a local machine, media from the databases on the  network  server,  the  real-time  input  from  a  mouse,  touch  screen,  joystick,  our  moving  bodies,  or  some  other  interface.  Therefore,  although some static documents may be involved, the final media  experience constructed by software usually does not correspond to  any single static document stored in some media. In other words, in  contrast to paintings, literary works, music scores, films, industrial  designs, or buildings, a critic cannot simply consult a single “file”  containing all of the work’s content.    Even in such seemingly simple cases as viewing a PDF document  or opening a photo in a media player, we are already dealing with  “software  performances”—since  it  is  software  which  defines  the  options for navigating, editing, and sharing the document, rather  than  the  document  itself.  Therefore  examining  the  PDF  file  or  a  JPEG file the way twentieth-century critics would examine a novel,  a  movie,  or  a  TV  program  will  only  tell  us  some  things  about  the  experience  we  get  when  we  interact  with  this  document  via  software—but not everything. This experience is equally shaped by  the interface and the tools provided by software. This is why the  examination of the tools, interfaces, assumptions, concepts, and the  history of cultural software—including the theories of its inventors  who in the 1960s and 1970s have defined most of these concepts— is essential if we are to make sense of contemporary media.   This shift in the nature of what constitutes a media “document”  also  calls  into  question  well-established  cultural  theories  that  depend  on  this  concept.  Consider  the  intellectual  paradigm  that  dominated  the  study  of  media  since  the  1950s—the  “trans- mission”  view  of  culture  developed  in  Communication  Studies.  Communication  scholars  have  taken  the  model  of  information  transmission formulated by Claude Shannon in his 1948 article A  Mathematical  Theory  of  Communication   1948 28  and  his  subse- quent book published with Warren Weaver in 1949,29 and applied   28 C.  E.  Shannon,  “A  Mathematical  Theory  of  Communication,”  Bell  System  Technical  Journal,  vol.  27,  pp.  379–423,  623–56,  July,  October,  1948,  http:   cm.bell-labs.com cm ms what shannonday shannon1948.pdf 29 Claude  E.  Shannon  and  Warren  Weaver,  The  Mathematical  Theory  of  Communication  University of Illinois Press, 1949 .      INTRODUCTION    35  its  basic  model  of  communication  to  mass  media.  The  paradigm  described mass communication  and sometimes culture in general   as a communication process between the authors who create and  send messages and the audiences that receive them. According to  this paradigm, the messages were not always fully decoded by the  audiences for technical reasons  noise in transmission  or semantic  reasons  they misunderstood the intended meanings .    Classical communication theory and media industries considered  such partial reception a problem; in contrast, in his influential 1980  article  “Encoding decoding”30  the  founder  of  British  Cultural  Studies, Stuart Hall, argued that the same phenomenon is positive.  Hall  proposed  that  the  audiences  construct  their  own  meanings  from  the  information  they  receive.  Rather  than  being  a  commu- nication  failure,  the  new  meanings  are  active  acts  of  intentional  reinterpretation of the sent messages. But both the classical commu- nication studies and cultural studies implicitly took for granted that  the  message  was  something  complete  and  definite—regardless  of  whether  it  was  stored  in  physical  media   e.g.  magnetic  tape   or  created in real time by a sender  a live TV broadcast . Thus, the  receiver of communication was assumed to read all of the adver- tising copy, see a whole movie, or listen to the whole song and only  after that s he would interpret it, misinterpret it, assign his her own  meanings, appropriate it, remix it, etc.   While this assumption has already been challenged by the intro- duction  of  the  DVR   digital  video  recorder   in  1999,  which  led  to  the  phenomenon  of  time  shifting,  it  simply  does  not  apply  to  interactive software-driven media. The interfaces of media access  applications, such as web browsers and search engines, the hyper- linked  architecture  of  the  World  Wide  Web,  and  the  interfaces  of  particular  online  media  services  offering  massive  numbers  of  media  artifacts  for  playback  preview  and or  purchase   Amazon,  Google  Play,  iTunes,  Rhapsody,  Netflix,  etc. ,  encourage  people  to  “browse,”  quickly  moving  both  horizontally  between  media   from one search result to the next, from one song to another, etc.   and vertically, through the media artifacts  e.g., from the contents  listing of a music album to a particular track . They also made it  easy to start playing viewing media at an arbitrary point, and to   30 Stuart Hall, “Encoding decoding,” in Culture, Media, Language, ed., Centre for  Contemporary Cultural Studies  London: Hutchinson, 1980 .   36   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  leave it at any point. In other words, the “message” that the user  “receives” is not just actively “constructed” by him her  through a  cognitive interpretation  but also actively managed  defining what  information s he is receiving and how .    It  is  at  least  as  important  that  when  a  user  interacts  with  a  software application that presents media content, this content often  does  not  have  any  fixed  finite  boundaries.  For  instance,  a  user  of  Google  Earth  is  likely  to  experience  a  different  “Earth”  every  time  s he  is  accessing  the  application.  Google  could  have  updated  some  of  the  satellite  photographs  or  added  new  Street  Views;  new  3D  buildings,  new  layers,  and  new  information  on  already  existing  layers were also likely to be added. Moreover, at any time a user of  the application can load more geospatial data created by other users  and  companies  by  either  selecting  one  of  the  options  in  the  Add  menu  Google Earth 6.2.1 interface , or directly opening a KLM file.  Google  Earth  is  a  typical  example  of  a  new  type  of  media  enabled  by the web—an interactive document which does not have all of its  content  pre-defined.  Its  content  changes  and  grows  over  time.    In  some  cases  this  may  not  affect  in  any  significant  way  the  larger  “messages”  “communicated”  by  the  software  application,  web service, game, or other type of interactive media. For example,  Google Earth’s built-in cartographic convention of representing the  Earth  using  the  General  Perspective  Projection   a  particular  map  projection method of cartography  does not change when users add  new content and turn on and off map layers. The “message” of this  representation is always present.31   However, since a user of Google Earth can also add his her own  media and information to the base representation provided by the  application,  creating  complex  and  media  rich  projects  on  top  of  existing geoinformation, Google Earth is not just a “message.” It  is a platform for users to build on. And while we can find some  continuity  here  with  the  users’  creative  reworking  of  commercial  media in the twentieth century—pop art and appropriation, music  remixes,  slash  fiction  and  video,32  and  so  on,  the  differences  are  larger than the similarities.  31 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Google_earthTechnical_specifications   March  14,  2012 . 32 See, for instance, Constance Penley, “Feminism, Psychoanalysis, and the Study of  Popular Culture,” in Cultural Studies, ed. Lawrence Grossberg  Routledge, 1992 .       INTRODUCTION    37    This shift from messages to platforms was in the center of the  Web’s transformation around 2004–6. The result was named Web  2.0. The 1990s websites presenting particular content created by  others  and thus, communicating “messages”  were supplemented  by  social  networks  and  social  media  sites  where  the  users  can  share,  comment  on,  and  tag  their  own  media.  The  Wikipedia  article on Web 2.0 describes these differences as follows: “A Web  2.0 site allows users to interact and collaborate with each other in  a social media dialogue as creators  prosumers  of user-generated  content  in  a  virtual  community,  in  contrast  to  websites  where  users   consumers   are  limited  to  the  passive  viewing  of  content  that  was  created  for  them.  Examples  of  Web  2.0  include  social  networking sites, blogs, wikis, video sharing sites, hosted services,  web applications, mashups and folksonomies.”33 For example, to  continue with the Google Earth example, users added many types  of global awareness information, including fair trade certification,  Greenpeace  data,  and  United  Nations  Millennium  Development  Goals Monitor.34 In another example, you can incorporate Google  Maps,  Wikipedia,  or  content  provided  by  most  other  large  web  2.0 sites directly in your web mashup—an even more direct way of  taking the content provided by web services and using it to craft  your own custom platforms.   The  wide  adoption  of  Web  2.0  services  along  with  various  web-based  communication  forums  about  all  popular  software,  collaborative  editing  on  Wikipedia,  Twitter,  etc.   enables  quick  identifications  of  omissions,  selec- tions, censorship and other types of “bad behavior” by software  publishers—another  feature  which  separates  content  distributed  by  web-based  companies  from  mass  media  of  the  twentieth  century. For example, every article on Wikipedia about a Web 2.0  service includes a special section about controversies, criticism, or  errors.   In  many  cases,  people  can  also  use  alternative  open  source  equivalents of paid and locked applications. Open source and  or  free  software   not  all  free  software  is  open  source   often  allow  for  additional  ways  of  creating,  remixing  and  sharing  both content and new software additions.  This does not mean    online  discussion   tools   33 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Web_2.0  March 14, 2012 . 34 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Google_earth  March 14, 2012 .   38   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  that open source software always uses different assumptions and  technologies  than  the  commercial  software.   For  example,  one  can choose to use a number of alternatives to Google Maps and  Google Earth—OpenStreetMap, Geocommons, WorldMap, and  others  which  all  have  open  source  or  free  software  licenses.35   Interestingly,  commercial  companies  also  often  use  data  from  such  free  collaboratively  created  systems  because  they  contain  more information than the companies’ own systems. OpenStreet  Map, which by early 2011 had 340,000 contributors,36 is used  by Flickr and Foursquare.37  A user can also examine the code of  open-source software to fully understand its assumptions and key  technologies.   Continuously  changing  and  growing  content  of  web  services  and sites; variety of mechanism for navigation and interaction; the  abilities to add one’s own content and mashup content from various  sources  together;  architectures  for  collaborative  authoring  and  editing; mechanisms for monitoring the providers—all these mecha- nisms clearly separate interactive networked software-driven media  from twentieth-century media documents. But even when a user is  working with a single local media document that is stored in a single  computer file  a rather rare situation these days , such a document  mediated through software interface has a different identity from a  twentieth-century  media  document.  The  user’s  experience  is  only  partly defined by the file’s content and its organization. The user  is free to navigate the document, choosing both what information  to see and the sequence in which s he is seeing it. And while “old  media”   with  the  exception  of  twentieth-century  broadcasting   also provided this random access, the interfaces of software-driven  media players viewers provide many additional ways for browsing  media and selecting what and how to access.    For  example,  Adobe  Acrobat  can  display  thumbnails  of  every  page in a PDF document; Google Earth can quickly zoom in and out  from the current view; online digital libraries, databases and repos- itories containing scientific articles and abstracts such as the ACM   35 http:  geocommons.com, http:  www.openstreetmap.org, http:  worldmap. harvard.edu 36 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Counter-mappingOpenStreetMap  March 27, 2012 . 37 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki OpenStreetMapDerivations_of_OpenStreetMap_ Data  March 27, 2012 .      INTRODUCTION    39  Digital  Library,  IEEE  Xplore,  PubMed,  Science  Direct,  SciVerse  Scopus, and Web of Science show articles which contain references  to  the  one  you  currently  selected.  Most  importantly,  these  new  tools  and  interfaces  are  not  hard-wired  to  the  media  documents  themselves  such as a random access capacity of a printed book   or media access machines  such as a radio ; instead they are part  of the separate software layer. This media architecture enables easy  addition  of  new  navigation  and  management  tools  without  any  change  to  the  documents  themselves.  For  instance,  with  a  single  click,  I  can  add  sharing  buttons  to  my  blog,  thus  enabling  new  ways of circulation for its content. When I open a text document  in Mac OS X Preview media viewer, I can highlight, add comments  and links, draw, and add thought bubbles. Photoshop allows me to  save my edits on separate “adjustment layers,” without modifying  the original image. And so on.  Why the history of cultural software does   not exist  “Всякое описание мира сильно отстает от его развития.”   Translation  from  Russian:  “Every  description  of  the  world  substantially lags behind its actual development.”   Тая Катюша, VJ on MTV.ru, 2008.38  We  live  in  a  software  culture—that  is,  a  culture  where  the  production, distribution, and reception of most content is mediated  by  software.  And  yet,  most  creative  professionals  do  not  know  anything about the intellectual history of software they use daily— be it Photoshop, Illustrator, GIMP, Final Cut, After Effects, Blender,  Flame, Maya, MAX, or Dreamweaver.    Where does contemporary cultural software came from? How  were  its  metaphors  and  techniques  arrived  at?  And  why  was  it  developed in the first place? Currently most prominent computer  and  web  companies  have  been  extensively  covered  in  media,  so  their  history  is  relatively  well-known   for  instance,  Facebook,  Google,  and  Apple .  But  this  is  only  the  tip  of  the  iceberg.  The  history  of  media  authoring  and  editing  software  remains  pretty  much  unknown.  Despite  the  common  statements  that  the    40   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  digital  revolution  is  at  least  as  important  as  the  invention  of  the  printing press, we are largely ignorant of how the key part of this  revolution—i.e.,  media  software—was  invented.  When  you  think  about this, it is unbelievable. People in the business of culture know  about  Gutenberg   printing  press ,  Brunelleschi   perspective ,  The  Lumière  Brothers,  Griffith  and  Eisenstein   cinema ,  Le  Corbusier   modern architecture , Isadora Duncan  modern dance , and Saul  Bass  motion graphics .  If you happen not to know one of these  names,  I  am  sure  that  you  have  other  cultural  friends  who  do .  And yet, even today, relatively few people have heard of J. C. R.  Licklider,  Ivan  Sutherland,  Ted  Nelson,  Douglas  Engelbart,  Alan  Kay,  and  their  collaborators  who,  between  approximately  1960  and 1978, gradually turned the computer into the cultural machine  it is today.    Remarkably,  the  history  of  cultural  software  as  a  discrete  category does not yet exist. What we have are a number of largely  biographical books about some of the key individual figures, and  research  labs  such  as  Xerox  PARC  or  MIT  Media  Lab—but  no  comprehensive  synthesis  which  would  trace  the  genealogical  tree  of media tools. And we also do not have any detailed studies which  would  relate  the  history  of  cultural  software  to  the  history  of  media, media theory, or history of visual culture.    Modern  art  institutions—museums  such  as  the  MOMA  and  the Tate, art book publishers such as Phaidon and Rizzoli, etc.— promote the history of modern art. Hollywood is similarly proud  of its own history—the stars, the directors, the cinematographers,  and the classical films. So how can we understand the neglect of  the history of cultural computing by our cultural institutions and  computer  industry  itself?  Why,  for  instance,  does  Silicon  Valley  not have a museum for cultural software?  The Computer History  museum in Mountain View, California has an extensive permanent  exhibition which is focused on hardware, operating systems, and  programming languages—but not on the history of software.38     I  believe  that  the  major  reason  has  to  do  with  economics.  Originally misunderstood and ridiculed, modern art has eventually  become  a  legitimate  investment  category—in  fact,  by  middle  of  the 2000s, the paintings of a number of twentieth-century artists   38 http:  www.mtv.ru air vjs taya main.wbp  February 21, 2008 .      INTRODUCTION    41  were selling for more money than the works of the most famous  classical artists. Similarly, Hollywood continues to receive profits  from old movies as it reissues them in new formats  VHS, DVD,  HD, Blu-ray disks, etc . What about the IT industry? It does not  derive  any  profits  from  the  old  software—and  therefore  it  does  nothing to promote its history. Of course, contemporary versions  of  Microsoft  Word,  Adobe  Photoshop,  Autodesk  AutoCAD,  and  many  other  popular  cultural  applications  were  built  on  the  first  versions,  which  often  date  from  the  1980s,  and  the  companies  continue to benefit from the patents they filed for new technologies  used in these original versions—but, in contrast to the video games  from  the  1980s,  these  early  software  versions  are  not  treated  as  separate  products  which  can  be  re-issued  today.   In  principle,  I  can  imagine  the  software  industry  creating  a  whole  new  market  for  old  software  versions  or  applications  which  at  some  point  were  quite  important  but  no  longer  exist  today—for  instance,  Aldus Pagemaker. In fact, given that consumer culture systemati- cally exploits adults’ nostalgia for the cultural experiences of their  teenage and youth years, it is actually surprising that early software  versions were not seen as a market opportunity. If I used MacWrite  and MacPaint daily in the middle of the 1980s, or Photoshop 1.0  and  2.0  in  1990–3,  I  think  these  experiences  would  be  as  much  part of my “cultural genealogy” as the movies and art I saw at that  time. Although I am not necessarily advocating the creation of yet  another  category  of  commercial  products,  if  early  software  was  widely available in simulation, it would catalyze cultural interest  in software similar to the way in which wide availability of early  computer  games,  recreated  for  contemporary  mobile  platforms,  fuels the field of video game studies.   Since most theorists so far have not considered cultural software  as  a  subject  of  its  own,  distinct  from  “social  media,”  “social  networks,”  “new  media,”  media  art,”  “the  internet,”  “interac- tivity,” and “cyberculture,” we lack not only a conceptual history  of media editing software but also systematic investigations of the  roles of software in media production. For instance, how did the  adoption  of  the  popular  animation  and  compositing  application  After Effects in the 1990s reshape the language of moving images?  How did the adoption of Alias, Maya and other 3D packages by  architectural  students  and  young  architects  in  the  same  decade  similarly  influence  the  language  of  architecture?  What  about  the    42   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  co-evolution of Web design tools and the aesthetics of websites— from the bare-bones HTML in 1994 to visually rich Flash-driven  sites five years later, and responsive web design in the early 2010s?  You  will  find  frequent  mentions  and  short  discussions  of  these  and  similar  questions  in  articles  and  conference  talks,  but  as  far  as I know, there has been no book-length study about any of these  subjects.  Often,  books  on  architecture,  motion  graphics,  graphic  design  and  other  design  fields  will  briefly  discuss  the  importance  of software tools in facilitating new possibilities and opportunities,  but these discussions are not usually further developed.   In  summary,  a  systematic  examination  of  the  connections  between  the  workings  of  contemporary  media  software  and  the  new  communication  languages  in  design  and  media   including  graphic  design,  web  design,  product  design,  motion  graphics,  animation,  and  cinema   has  not  yet  been  undertaken.  Although  this book alone cannot do it all, I hope that it will provide some  general models of how such connections can be teased out—as well  as provide a detailed analysis of how software use redefined certain  cultural areas  e.g., motion graphics and visual design .    By  focusing  on  the  theory  of  software  for  media  design,  this  book aims to complement the work of a few other theorists that  have  already  examined  software  responsible  for  game  platforms  and design  Ian Bogost, Nick Montfort , and electronic literature   Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Matthew Kirschenbaum .    In  this  respect,  the  related  fields  of  code  studies  and  platform  studies  being  developed  by  Mark  Marino,24  Nick  Montfort,  Ian  Bogost  and  others  are  playing  a  very  important  role.  According  to  Marino   and  I  completely  agree ,  the  three  fields  of  software  studies,  code  studies,  and  game  studies  complement  each  other:  “Critical  code  studies  is  an  emerging  field  related  to  software  studies and platform studies, but it’s more closely attuned to the  code  itself  of  a  program  rather  than  the  program’s  interface  and  usability  as in software studies  or its underlying hardware  as in  platform studies .”39   39 http:  chnm2011.thatcamp.org 05 24 session-proposal-critical-code studies    July  14, 2011 .      INTRODUCTION    43  Summary of the book’s narrative  Between  the  early  1990s  and  the  middle  of  the  2000s,  media  software  has  replaced  most  of  the  other  media  technologies  that  emerged in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Most contem- porary  media  is  created  and  accessed  via  cultural  software—and  yet,  surprisingly,  few  people  know  about  its  history.  What  was  the  thinking  and  motivation  of  people  who  between  1960  and  the late 1970s created the concepts and practical techniques that  underlie today’s cultural software? How does the shift to software- based  production  methods  in  the  1990s  change  our  concepts  of  “media”?  How  have  interfaces  and  the  tools  of  content  devel- opment  software  reshaped  and  continued  to  shape  the  aesthetics  and  visual  languages  we  see  in  contemporary  design  and  media?  These are the key questions that I take up in this book.   My  aim  is  not  provide  a  comprehensive  history  of  cultural  software in general, or media authoring software in particular. Nor  do I aim to discuss all the new creative techniques media software  enables  across  dozens  of  cultural  fields.  Instead,  I  will  trace  a  particular path through this history that will take us from 1960 to  today and which will pass through some of its most crucial points.  In  the  following  I  summarize  this  narrative  and  also  introduce  some of the key concepts developed in each part of the book.    Part 1 looks at the 1960s and 1970s. While new media theorists  have spent considerable efforts in trying to understand the relation- ships  between  digital  media  and  older  physical  and  electronic  media,  the  important  sources—the  writing  and  projects  by  Ivan  Sutherland, Douglas Engelbart, Ted Nelson, Alan Kay, and other  pioneers of cultural software working in these decades—still remain  largely  unexamined.  What  were  their  reasons  for  inventing  the  concepts and techniques that today make it possible for computers  to  represent,  or  “remediate”  other  media?  Why  did  these  people  and their colleagues work to systematically turn a computer into  a  machine  for  media  creation  and  manipulation?  These  are  the  questions that I take in Part 1, which explores them by focusing  on the ideas and work of the key protagonist of “cultural software  movement”—Alan Kay.  It is certainly possible to construct a more  exclusive or an alternative history which will pay equal attention  to  dozens  of  brilliant  people  who  worked  with  these  people  and    44   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  who,  together,  invented  all  the  details  which  form  the  DNA  of  contemporary media software—for instance, Bob Taylor, Charles  Thacker,  John  Warnock,  and  others  working  at  Xerox  PARC  in  the 1970s; or the people who contributed to the design of the first  Macintosh.40 However, since we do not yet even have a theoretical  analysis  of  how  the  ideas  of  the  most  well-known  figures  of  the  1960s collectively changed media, this book will start with these  figures, and the analysis of their theoretical writings.     I suggest that Kay and cultural software pioneers aimed to create  a particular kind of new media—rather than merely simulating the  appearances  of  old  ones.  These  new  media  use  already  existing  representational  formats  as  their  building  blocks,  while  adding  many  previously  nonexistent  properties.  At  the  same  time,  as  envisioned  by  Kay,  these  media  are  expandable—that  is,  users  themselves should be able to easily add new properties, as well as  to  invent  new  media.  Accordingly,  Kay  calls  computers  the  first  metamedium  whose  content  is  “a  wide  range  of  already-existing  and not-yet-invented media.”   The foundations necessary for the existence of such metamedium  were established between the 1960s and the late 1970s. During this  period,  most  previously  available  physical  and  electronic  media  were  systematically  simulated  in  software,  and  a  number  of  new  media were also invented. This development takes us from the very  interactive design program—Ivan Sutherland’s Sketchpad  1962 — to the commercial desktop applications that made software-based  media  authoring  and  design  widely  available  to  members  of  different creative professions and, eventually, media consumers as  well—AutoCAD   1982 ,  Word   1984 ,  PageMaker   1985 ,  Alias   1985 ,  Illustrator   1987 ,  Director   1987 ,  Photoshop   1989 ,  After Effects  1993 , and others.  These PC applications were paral- leled  by  much  more  expensive  systems  for  professional  markets  such as the TV and video industries which got Paintbox in 1981,  Harry in 1985, Avid in 1989, and Flame in 1992.    So what happens next? Did Kay’s theoretical formulations as  articulated  in  1977  accurately  predict  the  developments  of  the  next thirty years, or have there been new developments that his  concept  of  “metamedium”  did  not  account  for?  Today  we  do   40 For the stories that document the inventions by dozens of people of the multiple  technologies that made up the original Macintosh, see www.folklore.com      INTRODUCTION    45  indeed  use  a  variety  of  previously  existing  media  simulated  in  software as well as new previously non-existent media types. Both  have been continuously extended with new properties. Do these  processes of invention and amplification take place at random,  or do they follow particular paths? In other words, what are the  key mechanisms responsible for the extension of the computer  metamedium?    Parts 2 and 3 are devoted to these questions. They look at the  number  of  different  mechanisms  which  drove  development  and  expansion  of  the  computer  metamedium,  with  the  focus  on  the  1990s when media software was gradually adopted in all areas of  professional  media  production.  I  use  three  different  concepts  to  describe these developments and the new aesthetics of visual media  which developed in the second part of the 1990s after the processes  of  adoption  reached  sufficient  speed.  These  three  concepts  are  media  hybridization,  evolution,  and  deep  remix.  Part  2  develops  the theoretical analysis of this second stage of metamedium devel- opment,  illustrating  it  with  a  number  of  examples  drawn  from  different  genres  of  digital  media.  Part  3  focuses  in  detail  on  the  use  of  software  for  visual  design   motion  graphics  and  graphics  design , analyzing the relationships between the new aesthetics of  moving and still images and compositions, and the operations and  interfaces of software used to create them such as After Effects.  I argue that in the process of the translation from physical and    electronic media technologies to software, all individual techniques  and  tools  that  were  previously  unique  to  different  media  “met”  within  the  same  software  environment.  This  meeting  had  funda- mental consequences for human cultural development and for the  media evolution. It disrupted and transformed the whole landscape  of media technologies, the creative professions that use them, and  the very concept of media itself.   Once  they  were  simulated  in  a  computer,  previously  incom- patible  techniques  of  different  media  begin  to  be  combined  in  endless  new  ways,  leading  to  new  media  hybrids,  or,  to  use  a  biological  metaphor,  new  “media  species.”  As  just  one  example  among countless others, think, for instance, of the popular Google  Earth  application,  combining  techniques  of  traditional  mapping,  the  concepts  from  the  field  of  Geographical  Information  Systems   GIS ,  3D  computer  graphics  and  animation,  social  software,  search, and other elements and functions. In my view, this ability to    46   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  combine previously separate media techniques represents a funda- mentally new stage in the history of human media, human semiosis,  and human communication, enabled by its “softwarization.”    I describe this new stage in media evolution using the concept  of hybridity. In the first stage, most existing media were simulated  in a computer and a number of new types of media that can only  be realized in a computer were invented. In the second stage, these  simulated  and  new  mediums  started  exchanging  properties  and  techniques.   To  distinguish  these  processes  from  more  familiar  remixes,  I  introduce  the  new  term  deep  remixability.  Normally  a  remix  is  a  combination  of  content  from  a  single  medium   like  in  music  remixes , or from a few mediums  like Anime Music Video works  which  combine  content  from  anime  and  music  video .  However,  the  software  production  environment  allows  designers  to  remix  not only the content of different media types, but also their funda- mental techniques, working methods, and ways of representation  and expression.    While today hybridization and deep remix can be found at work  in all areas of culture where software is used, I focus on particular  area  to  demonstrate  how  it  functions  in  detail.  This  area  is  visual  design in general, and motion graphics in particular. Motion graphics  is a dynamic part of contemporary culture, which, as far as I know,  has not yet been theoretically analyzed in detail anywhere. Although  selected precedents for contemporary motion graphics can already be  found in the 1950s and 1960s in the works by Saul Bass and Pablo  Ferro, its exponential growth from the middle of the 1990s is directly  related  to  the  adoption  of  software  for  moving  image  design— specifically, After Effects software released by Adobe in 1993. Deep  remixability is central to the aesthetics of motion graphics. That is,  the larger proportion of motion graphics projects done today around  the  world  derive  their  aesthetic  effects  from  combining  different  techniques  and  media  traditions—animation,  drawing,  typography  photography,  3D  graphics,  video,  etc.—in  new  ways.  As  a  part  of  my  analysis,  I  look  at  how  the  typical  software-based  production  workflow  in  a  contemporary  design  studio—the  ways  in  which  a  project moves from one software application to another—shapes the  aesthetics of motion graphics, and visual design in general.    The  next  major  wave  of  computerization  of  culture  has  to  do  with  different  types  of  software—social  networks,  social  media       INTRODUCTION    47  services,  and  apps  for  mobile  platforms.  The  wave  of  social  networks and social media started slowly, erupted in 2005–2006   Flickr,  YouTube   and  continues  to  move  forward  and  expand  its  reach.  The  1990s’  media  revolution  impacted  professional  creatives; the 2000s’ media revolution affected the rest of us—i.e.  the  hundreds  of  millions  who  use  Facebook,  Twitter,  Firefox,  Safari,  Google  Search  and  Maps,  Flickr,  Picasa,  Vimeo,  Blogger,  and numerous apps and services available on mobile platforms.    Because we are still in the middle of social media diffusion, with  some popular social media services going out of favor and others  gaining  speed   for  example,  think  of  the  fate  of  MySpace ,  and  the  “social”  functionality  of  software  still  expanding,  I  decided  that  offering  the  detailed  theoretical  analysis  of  this  new  wave  would be premature.  This became clear after I started editing the  part  about  social  media  which  I  originally  had  in  the  first  book  draft,  and  realized  that  some  of  the  social  media  services  I  was  analyzing in detail no longer exist… .  Instead, I am focusing on  tracing  the  fundamental  developments  which  made  possible  and  shaped “digital media” before its social explosion: the ideas about  the  computer  as  a  machine  for  media  generation  and  editing  of  the  1960s–1970s,  their  implementation  in  the  media  applica- tions in the 1980s–1990s, and the transformation of visual media  languages which quickly followed.    To be more precise, we can frame this history between 1961 and  1999. In 1961, Ivan Sutherland at MIT designed Sketchpad, which  became the first computer design system shown to the public. In  1999,  After  Effects  4.0  introduced  Premiere  import,41  Photoshop  5.5 added vector shapes,42 and Apple showed the first version of  Final  Cut  Pro43—in  short,  the  current  paradigm  of  interoperable  media authoring and editing tools capable of creating professional  media without special hardware beyond the off-the-shelf computer  was  finalized.  And  while  professional  media  tools  continued  to  evolve after this period, the changes so far have been incremental.  Similarly, the languages of professional visual media created with  this software did not change significantly after their radical trans- formation in the second part of the 1990s.  41 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki After_EffectsHistory  July 7, 2011 . 42 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Adobe_Photoshop_release_history  July 7, 2011 . 43 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Final_Cut_ProHistory  July 7, 2011 .   48   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND    To  illustrate  this  continuity,  the  examples  of  particular  media  projects that I will analyze will be drawn from both the 1990s and  the  2000s.  However,  when  discussing  interfaces  and  commands  of  media  applications,  I  will  use  the  recent  versions  in  order  to  make the discussion as relevant as possible for the software users.  Accordingly,  I  will  also  take  into  account  the  addition  of  social  media  capacities  in  all  consumer-level  media  software  that  took  place at the end of the 2000s  e.g., the “share” menu in iPhoto .  And because the hybridization mechanism is not limited to profes- sional media software and professionally created media, but also  plays the key role in evolution of social web software and services,  I  will  include  prominent  examples  of  such  services,  for  example,  Google Earth.    I  also  need  to  comment  on  my  choices  of  particular  media  software applications as examples. I have chosen to focus on the  desktop applications for media authoring most widely used today— Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Dreamweaver, After Effects, Final  Cut,  Maya,  3ds  Max,  Word,  PowerPoint,  etc.  These  programs  exemplify different categories of media authoring software: image  editing, vector graphics, page layout, web design, motion graphics,  video editing, 3D modeling and animation, word processing, and  presentation.  I  will  also  be  making  references  to  popular  web  browsers   Firefox,  Chrome,  Internet  Explorer ,  blogging  tools  and  publishing  services   WordPress,  Blogger ,  social  networks   Facebook,  Twitter,  Google+ ,  media  sharing  services   Flickr,  Pinterest,  YouTube,  Vimeo ,  email  services  and  clients   Gmail,  Microsoft  Outlook ,  web-based  office  suites   Google  Docs ,  and  consumer  geographic  information  systems   Google  Earth,  Bing  Maps .  Since  I  am  interested  in  how  users  interact  with  media,  another  key  software  category  for  this  book  is  media  players  pre-installed  on  new  computers   Windows  Media  Player,  iTunes,  QuickTime   and  document  viewing  applications   Adobe  Reader,  Mac OS Preview . As some programs and web services become less  popular and new ones gain market share, the list above may look  somewhat  different  by  the  time  you  are  reading  this,  and  many  applications may also fully migrate from desktop to the web—but  the categories are likely to remain the same.    Because I want to make my discussions as relevant as possible  to  contemporary  designers  and  artists,  the  names  of  historically  important programs which are no longer popular or do not exist       INTRODUCTION    49  will  only  be  mentioned  in  passing.  Examples  are  QuarkXPress,  WordPerfect,  and  Macromedia  Director.  Luckily  for  us,  the  two  programs that I will analyze in detail—Photoshop  Chapter 2  and  After Effects  Chapter 5 —are as popular today as they were in the  1990s.   I will not be discussing other types of digital media authoring  and editing systems which were quite important in the 1980s and  1990s. Because during this period graphics capacities of personal  computers were still limited, these systems ran on graphics worksta- tions   specialized  minicomputers   from  Silicon  Graphics  or  used  proprietary  hardware.  Here  are  examples  listed  in  chronological  order,  with  the  function  of  the  system,  company  name  and  year  of  the  first  release  appearing  in  parentheses:  Paintbox   graphics  for broadcast television, Quantel, 1981 , Mirage  digital real-time  video effects processor, Quantel, 1982 ,44 Personal Visualizer  3D  modeling and animation, Wavefront, 1988 , Henry and Hal  effects  editor  and  graphics  and  compositing  systems,  Quantel,  1992   Inferno and Flame  compositing for film and video, Discreet Logic,  1992 .  In the middle 1990s, Flame together with the SGI workstation    cost $450,000; an Inferno system cost $700,000.45 Inferno 5 and  Flame 8 introduced in 2003 had suggested list prices of $571,500  and $266,500, respectively.46 Because of these prices, such systems  were only used in television and film studios or in big video effects  companies.    Today  the  most  demanding  areas  of  media  production  which  involve  working  with  massive  amounts  of  data—feature  films,  feature  animations,  TV  commercials—still  rely  on  these  systems’  expensive software. While at the end of the 2000s the companies  started to offer versions of these programs for PC, Macs, and Linux,  today the highest-end versions still often require special hardware,  and their prices are still quite high.  For example, the 2010 edition  of Autodesk Flame Premium, a suite containing Smoke, Flame and   44 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Quantel_Mirage  August 23, 2012 . 45 “Discreet Logic Inc. History,” http:  www.fundinguniverse.com company-  histories discreet-logic-inc-history  46 Autodesk, “Discreet Delivers inferno 5, flame 8 and flint 8,” January 23, 2003,  http:  investors.autodesk.com phoenix.zhtml?c=117861&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=  374002   50   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Lustre used for video editing, effects, and color grading was offered  for $125,000.    Because  I  do  not  expect  a  typical  reader  of  this  book  to  have  a working experience with these expensive systems, I will not be  referring to them further in this book. However, a more compre- hensive  history  of  the  moving  image  media  of  the  1980s–1990s   which  I  hope  somebody  will  write  in  the  future   will  definitely  need to do an archeology and genealogy of these systems and their  use.    Finally,  one  more  explanation  is  in  order.  Some  readers  will  be  annoyed  that  I  focus  on  commercial  applications  for  media  authoring  and  editing,  as  opposed  to  their  open  source  alterna- tives.  For  instance,  I  discuss  Photoshop  rather  than  Gimp,  and  Illustrator  rather  than  Inkscape.  I  love  and  support  open  source  and free access, and use it for all my work. Starting in 1994, I was  making all my articles available for free download on my website  manovich.net.  And  when  in  2007  I  set  up  a  research  lab   www. softwarestudies.com   to  start  analyzing  and  visualizing  massive  large  media  datasets,  we  decided  to  also  follow  a  free  software  open source strategy, making the tools we develop freely available  and allowing others to modify them.47    The  reason  this  book  focuses  on  commercial  media  authoring  and  editing  software  rather  than  its  open  source  equivalents  is  simple.  In  almost  all  areas  of  software  culture,  people  use  free  applications and web services. The examples include web browsers,  web  email,  social  networks,  apps  available  for  mobile  devices,  and  programming  and  scripting  languages.  The  companies  are  not charging for these free applications and services because they  are making money in other ways  advertising, charging for extra  features and services, membership fees, selling devices . However,  in the case of professional tools for media authoring and editing,  commercial  software  dominates.  It  is  not  necessarily  better,  but  it  is  simply  used  by  many  more  people.   For  example,  entering  “Photoshop”  and  “Gimp”  into  Google  Trends  shows  that  since  2004, the number of searches for the former is about eight times  bigger than for the latter.  Since I am interested in describing the  common  user  experiences,  and  the  features  of  media  aesthetics   47 http:  lab.softwarestudies.com p software-for-digital-humanities.html      INTRODUCTION    51  common  to  millions  of  works  created  with  the  most  common  authoring  tools  that  are  all  commercial  products,  these  are  the  products I choose to analyze. And when I analyze tools for media  access  and  collaboration,  I  similarly  choose  the  most  popular  products—which  in  this  case  includes  both  free  software  and  services provided by commercial companies  Safari, Google Earth ,  and free open source software  Firefox .     PART ONE  Inventing   media software    CHAPTER ONE  Alan Kay’s universal   media machine  Medium: 8.a. A specific kind of artistic technique or means of expression  as  determined  by  the  materials  used  or  the  creative  methods  involved: the medium of lithography. b.  The  materials  used  in  a  specific  artistic  technique:  oils  as  a  medium.  American  Heritage  Dictionary,  4th  edition   Houghton  Mifflin,  2000   “The best way to predict the future is to invent it.”  Alan Kay  Appearance versus function  Between its invention in the mid-1940s and the arrival of PCs in  the early 1980s, the digital computer was mostly used for military,  scientific, and business calculations and data processing. It was not  interactive. It was not designed to be used by a single person. In  short, it was hardly suited for cultural creation.    As  a  result  of  a  number  of  developments  of  the  1980s  and  1990s—the  rise  of  the  personal  computer  industry,  adoption  of  Graphical  User  Interfaces   GUI ,  the  expansion  of  computer    56   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  networks  and  the  World  Wide  Web—computers  moved  into  the  cultural  mainstream.  Software  replaced  many  other  tools  and  technologies  for  creative  professionals.  It  has  given  hundreds  of  millions  of  people  the  abilities  to  create,  manipulate,  sequence  and share media—but has this led to the invention of fundamen- tally  new  forms  of  culture?  Today  media  companies  are  busy  promoting  e-books  and  interactive  television;  the  consumers  are  happily  purchasing  music  albums  and  feature  films  distributed  in digital form, as well making photographs and video with their  digital  cameras  and  cell  phones;  office  workers  are  reading  PDF  documents which imitate paper.    In short, it appears that the revolution in the means of production,  distribution, and access of media has not been accompanied by a  similar  revolution  in  the  syntax  and  semantics  of  media.  Who  shall  we  blame  for  this?  Shall  we  put  the  blame  on  the  pioneers  of  cultural  computing—J.  C.  R.  Licklider,  Ivan  Sutherland,  Ted  Nelson, Douglas Engelbart, Seymour Paper, Nicholas Negroponte,  Alan Kay, and others? Or, as Nelson and Kay themselves are eager  to point out, does the problem lie with the way the industry imple- mented their ideas?    Before we blame the industry for bad implementation—we can  always pursue this argument later if necessary—let us look into the  thinking  of  the  inventors  of  cultural  computing  themselves.  For  instance, what about the person who guided the development of a  prototype of a modern person computer—Alan Kay?   Between  1970  and  1981  Alan  Kay  was  working  at  Xerox  PARC—a  research  center  established  by  Xerox  in  Palo  Alto.  Building  on  the  already  accomplished  work  of  the  pioneers  of  cultural computing, the Learning Research Group at Xerox PARC  headed  by  Kay,  systematically  articulated  the  paradigm  and  the  technologies of vernacular media computing, as it exists today.1    1 Kay has expressed his ideas in a few articles and a large number of interviews  and public lectures. The following have been my main primary sources: Alan Kay  and Adele Goldberg, Personal Dynamic Media, IEEE Computer 10, no. 3  1977 ;  Alan Kay, “The Early History of Smalltalk,” The 2nd ACM SIGPLAN Conference  on History of Programming Languages  New York: ACM, 1993 , pp. 69–95; Alan  Kay, “A Personal Computer for Children of All Ages,”  Proceedings of the ACM  1972  National  Conference   Boston,  1972 ;  Alan  Kay, Doing  with  Images  Makes  Symbols,  videotape   University  Video  Communications,  1987 ,  http:  archive.org  details AlanKeyD1987 ; Alan Kay, “User Interface: A Personal View,” in The Art of       ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    57    Although selected artists, filmmakers, musicians, and architects  were  already  using  computers  since  the  1950s,  often  developing  their  software  in  collaboration  with  computer  scientists  working  in  research  labs   Bell  Labs,  IBM  Watson  Research  Center,  etc.   most  of  this  software  was  aimed  at  producing  only  particular  kinds of images, animations or music, congruent with the ideas of  their authors. In addition, each program was designed to run on a  particular machine. Therefore, these software programs could not  function as general-purpose tools easily usable by others.    It is well known most of the key ingredients of personal computers  as they exist today came out of Xerox PARC: the Graphical User  Interface with overlapping windows and icons, bitmapped display,  color graphics, networking via Ethernet, mouse, laser printer, and  WYSIWYG  “what you see is what you get”  printing. But what  is equally important is that Kay and his colleagues also developed  a range of applications for media manipulation and creation that  also all used a graphical interface. They included a word processor,  a  file  system,  a  drawing  and  painting  program,  an  animation  program,  a  music  editing  program,  etc.  Both  the  general  user  interface and the media manipulation programs were written in the  same programming language, Smalltalk. While some of the appli- cations  were  programmed  by  members  of  Kay’s  group,  the  users  that  included  seventh-grade  high-school  students  programmed  others.2   This  was  consistent  with  the  essence  of  Kay’s  vision:  to  provide  users  with  a  programming  environment,  examples  of  programs, and already-written general tools so the users would be  able to make their own creative tools.     When Apple introduced the first Macintosh computer in 1984,  it  brought  the  vision  developed  at  Xerox  PARC  to  consumers   the  new  computer  was  priced  at  USD  $2,495 .  The  original  Macintosh  128K  included  a  word  processing  and  a  drawing  application  MacWrite and MacPaint, respectively . Within a few  years these were joined by other software for creating and editing   Human-Computer Interface Design, ed.

In  the  early 1990s, similar functionality became available on PCs running  Microsoft  Windows.4  And  while  Macs  and  PCs  were  at  first  not  fast  enough  to  offer  true  competition  for  traditional  media  tools  and  technologies   with  the  exception  of  word  processing ,  other  computer  systems  specifically  optimized  for  media  processing  started  to  compete  with  these  technologies  in  the  1980s.   The  examples are the NeXT Workstation, produced between 1989 and  1996;  Amiga,  produced  between  1985  and  1994;  and  Paintbox,  first released in 1981.    By around 1991, the new identity of a computer as a personal  media  editor  was  firmly  established.   This  year  Apple  released  QuickTime,  which  brought  video  to  the  desktop;  the  same  year  saw the release of James Cameron’s Terminator II, which featured  pioneering computer-generated special effects . The vision developed  at  Xerox  PARC  became  a  reality—or  rather,  one  important  part  of  this  vision  in  which  the  computer  was  turned  into  a  personal  machine  for  display,  authoring  and  editing  content  in  different  media.  And  while  in  most  cases  Alan  Kay  and  his  collaborators  were  not  the  first  to  develop  particular  kinds  of  media  applica- tions—for instance, paint programs and animation programs were  already written in the second part of the 1960s5—by implementing  all  of  them  on  a  single  machine  and  giving  them  consistent  appearance  and  behavior,  Xerox  PARC  researchers  established  a  new paradigm of media computing.    I think that I have made my case. The evidence is overwhelming. It  is Alan Kay and his collaborators at PARC that we must take to task  for  making  digital  computers  imitate  older  media.  By  developing  easy-to-use GUI-based software to create and edit familiar media  types,  Kay  and  others  appear  to  have  locked  the  computer  into  being a simulation machine for “old media.” Or, to put this in terms  of Jay Bolter and Richard Grusin’s influential book Remediation:  Understanding  New  Media   2000 ,  we  can  say  that  GUI-based  software turned a digital computer into a “remediation machine:”     3 Videoworks was renamed Director in 1987.   4 1982: AutoCAD; 1989: Illustrator; 1992: Photoshop, QuarkXPress.   5 See http:  sophia.javeriana.edu.co ~ochavarr computer_graphics_history historia       ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    59  a machine that expertly represents a range of earlier media.  Other  technologies  developed  at  PARC,  such  as  the  bitmapped  color  display used as the main computer screen, laser printing, and the  first Page Description Language which eventually lead to Postscript,  were similarly conceived to support the computer’s new role as a  machine for simulation of physical media.    Bolter and Grusin define remediation as “the representation of  one medium in another.”6 According to their argument, new media  always remediate the old ones and therefore we should not expect  that  computers  would  function  any  differently.  This  perspective  emphasizes  the  continuity  between  computational  media  and  earlier media. Rather than being separated by different logics, all  media including computers follow the same logic of remediation.  The  only  difference  between  computers  and  other  media  lies  in  how  and  what  they  remediate.  As  Bolter  and  Grusin  put  this  in  the first chapter of their book, “What is new about digital media  lies  in  their  particular  strategies  for  remediating  television,  film,  photography, and painting.” In another place in the same chapter  they  make  an  equally  strong  statement  that  leaves  no  ambiguity  about their position: “We will argue that remediation is a defining  characteristic of the new digital media.”   If  today  we  consider  all  the  digital  media  created  by  both  consumers  and  by  professionals—digital  photography  and  video  shot  with  inexpensive  cameras  and  cell  phones,  the  contents  of  personal  blogs  and  online  journals,  illustrations  created  in  Photoshop,  feature  films  cut  on  Avid,  etc.—in  terms  of  its  appearance  digital  media  indeed  often  looks  exactly  the  same  way  as  media  before  computers.  Thus,  if  we  limit  ourselves  to  looking at the media surfaces, the remediation argument accurately  describes much of computational media. But rather than accepting  this condition as an inevitable consequence of the universal logic of  remediation, we should ask why this is the case. In other words, if  contemporary computational media imitates other media, how did  this become possible? There was definitely nothing in the original  theoretical  formulations  of  digital  computers  by  Turing  or  Von  Neumann about computers imitating other media such as books,  photography, or film.     6 Jay  Bolter  and  Richard  Grusin,  Remediation:  Understanding  New  Media   The  MIT Press, 2000 .   60   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND    The  conceptual  and  technical  gap  which  separates  the  first  room-sized  computers  used  by  the  military  to  calculate  the  shooting tables for anti-aircraft guns and crack German communi- cation codes, and contemporary small desktops and laptops used  by  ordinary  people  to  create,  edit  and  share  media  is  vast.  The  contemporary  identity  of  a  computer  as  a  media  processor  took  about forty years to emerge, if we count from 1949 when MIT’s  Lincoln Laboratory started to work on first interactive computers  to  1989  when  the  first  commercial  version  of  Photoshop  was  released.  It  took  generations  of  brilliant  and  creative  thinkers  to  invent the multitude of concepts and techniques that today make  possible for computers to “remediate” other media so well. What  were  their  reasons  for  doing  this?  What  was  their  thinking?  In  short, why did these people dedicate their careers to inventing the  ultimate “remediation machine”?    While media theorists have spent considerable efforts in trying  to  understand  the  relationships  between  digital  media  and  older  physical and electronic media in the 1990s and 2000s, the important  sources—the  writing  and  projects  by  Ivan  Sutherland,  Douglas  Engelbart, Ted Nelson, Alan Kay, and other pioneers working in  the  1960s  and  1970s—remained  largely  unexamined.  This  book  does not aim to provide a comprehensive intellectual history of the  invention of media computing. Thus, I am not going to consider  the thinking of all key figures in the history of media computing   to do this right would require more than one book . Rather, my  concern is with the present and the future. Specifically, I want to  understand  some  of  the  dramatic  transformations  in  what  media  is, what it can do, and how we use it—the transformations that are  clearly connected to the shift from previous media technologies to  software. Some of these transformations had already taken place  in the 1990s but were not much discussed at the time  for instance,  the  emergence  of  a  new  language  of  moving  images  and  visual  design  in  general .  Others  have  not  even  been  named  yet.  Still  others—such as remix and mashup culture—are being referred to  all the time, and yet the analysis of how they were made possible  by the evolution of media software has so far not been attempted.  In short, I want to understand what is “media after software”—   that  is,  what  happened  to  the  techniques,  languages,  and  the  concepts of twentieth-century media as a result of their computer- ization.  Or,  more  precisely,  what  has  happened  to  media  after       ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    61  they have been software-sized.  And since in the space of a single  book I can only consider some of these techniques, languages and  concepts, I will focus on those that, in my opinion, have not been  yet discussed by others.    In this chapter we will take a closer look at one place where the  identity of a computer as a “remediation machine” was largely put  in  place—Alan  Kay’s  Learning  Research  Group  at  Xerox  PARC,  in  operation  during  the  1970s.  We  can  ask  two  questions:  first,  what exactly did Kay want to do, and second, how did he and his  colleagues  go  about  achieving  it?  The  brief  answer—which  will  be  expanded  below—is  that  Kay  wanted  to  turn  computers  into  a  “personal  dynamic  media”  which  could  be  used  for  learning,  discovery, and artistic creation. His group achieved this by system- atically  simulating  most  existing  media  within  a  computer  while  simultaneously  adding  many  new  properties  to  these  media.  Kay  and his collaborators also developed a new type of programming  language that, at least in theory, would allow the users to quickly  invent  new  types  of  media  using  the  set  of  general  tools  already  provided  for  them.  All  these  tools  and  simulations  of  already  existing  media  were  given  a  unified  user  interface  designed  to  activate  multiple  mentalities  and  ways  of  learning—kinesthetic,  iconic, and symbolic.   Kay conceived of “personal dynamic media” as a fundamentally  new  kind  of  media  with  a  number  of  historically  unprecedented  properties  such  as  the  ability  to  hold  all  the  user’s  information,  simulate all types of media within a single machine, and “involve the  learner  in  a  two-way  conversation.”7  These  properties  enable  new  relationships between the user and the media s he may be creating,  editing, or viewing on a computer. And this is essential if we want to  understand  the  relationships  between  computers  and  earlier  media.  Briefly  put,  while  visually,  computational  media  may  closely  mimic  other media, these media now function in different ways.    For instance, consider digital photography, which often imitates  traditional photography in appearance. For Bolter and Grusin, this  is an example of how digital media ‘remediates” its predecessors.     7 Since  the  work  of  Kay’s  group  in  the  1970s,  computer  scientists,  hackers  and  designers added many other unique properties—for instance, we can quickly move  media around the net and share it with millions of people using Flickr, YouTube,  and other sites.   62   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  But  rather  than  only  paying  attention  to  their  appearance,  let  us  think  about  how  digital  photographs  can  function.  If  a  digital  photograph  is  turned  into  a  physical  object  in  the  world—an  illustration  in  a  magazine,  a  poster  on  the  wall,  a  print  on  a  t-shirt—it  functions  in  the  same  ways  as  its  predecessor   unless  it  has  augmented  reality  features,  like  IKEA’s  2013  catalog .8  But  if  we  leave  the  same  photograph  inside  its  native  computer  environment—which may be a laptop, a network storage system,  or any computer-enabled media device such as a cell phone which  allows its user to edit this photograph and move it to other devices  and  the  Internet—it  can  function  in  ways  which,  in  my  view,  make  it  radically  different  from  its  traditional  equivalent.  To  use  a  different  term,  we  can  say  that  a  digital  photograph  offers  its  users many “affordances” that its non-digital predecessor did not.  For  example,  a  digital  photograph  can  be  quickly  modified  in  numerous ways and equally quickly combined with other images;  instantly moved around the world and shared with other people;  and inserted into a multimedia document, or an architectural 3D  design.  Furthermore,  we  can  automatically   i.e.,  by  running  the  appropriate algorithms  improve its contrast, make it sharper, and  even in some situations remove blur.    Note  that  only  some  of  these  new  properties  are  specific  to  a  particular medium—in our example, a digital photograph, i.e. an  array of pixels represented as numbers. Other properties are shared  by a larger class of media species—for instance, at the current stage  of digital culture, all types of media files can be attached to an email  message. Still others are even more general features of a computer  environment within the current GUI paradigm as developed forty  years ago at PARC: for instance, the fast response of a computer  to  a  user’s  actions  which  ensures  “no  discernible  pause  between  cause  and  effect.”9  Still  others  are  enabled  by  network  protocols  such as TCP IP that allow all kinds of computers and other devices  to be connected to the same network. In summary, we can say that  only  some  of  the  “new  DNA”  of  a  digital  photograph  is  due  its  particular place of birth, i.e., inside a digital camera. Many others     8 Roberto  Baldwin,  “Ikea’s  Augmented  Reality  Catalog  Will  Let  You  Peek  Inside  Furniture,”  July  20,  2012,  http:  www.wired.com gadgetlab 2012 07  ikeas-augmented-reality-catalog-lets-you-peek-inside-the-malm    9 Kay and Goldberg, Personal Dynamic Media, p. 394.

Before  diving  further  into  Kay’s  ideas,  I  should  more  fully  disclose my reasons for focusing on him as opposed to somebody  else.  The  story  I  will  present  could  also  be  told  differently.  It  is  possible  to  put  Sutherland’s  work  on  Sketchpad  in  the  center  of  computational  media  history;  or  Engelbart  and  his  Research  Center  for  Augmenting  Human  Intellect  which  throughout  the  1960s developed hypertext  independently of Nelson , the mouse,  the window, the word processor, mixed text graphics displays, and  a number of other “firsts.” Or we can shift focus to the work of  the  Architecture  Machine  Group  at  MIT,  which  since  1967  was  headed  by  Nicholas  Negroponte   in  1985  this  group  became  the  MIT  Media  Lab .  We  also  need  to  recall  that  by  the  time  Kay’s  Learning Research Group at PARC fleshed out the details of GUI  and  programmed  various  media  editors  in  Smalltalk   a  paint  program,  an  illustration  program,  an  animation  program,  etc. ,  artists,  filmmakers  and  architects  were  already  using  computers  for more than a decade and a number of large-scale exhibitions of  computer art were put in major museums around the world such as  the Institute of Contemporary Art, London, The Jewish Museum,  New York, and Los Angeles County Museum of Art. And certainly,  in  terms  of  advancing  computer  techniques  for  visual  represen- tation enabled by computers, other groups of computer scientists  were already ahead. For instance, at the University of Utah, which  became the main place for computer graphics research during the  first  half  of  the  1970s,  scientists  were  producing  3D  computer  graphics far superior to the simple images that could be created on  computers  being  built  at  PARC.  Next  to  the  University  of  Utah,  a  company  called  Evans  and  Sutherland   headed  by  the  same  Ivan Sutherland who was also teaching at the University of Utah   was  already  using  3D  graphics  for  flight  simulators—essentially  pioneering the type of new media that can be called “navigable 3D  virtual space.”    While  the  practical  work  accomplished  at  Xerox  PARC  to  establish the computer as a comprehensive media machine is one  of my reasons, it is not the only one. The key reason I decided to  focus on Kay is his theoretical formulations that place computers in  relation to other media and media history. While Vannevar Bush,  J. C. R. Licklider and Douglas Engelbart were primary concerned    64   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  with  augmentation  of  intellectual  and  in  particular  scientific  work, Kay was equally interested in computers as “a medium of  expression  through  drawing,  painting,  animating  pictures,  and  composing  and  generating  music.”10  Therefore  if  we  really  want  to understand how and why computers were redefined as a culture  machine, and how the new computational media is different from  earlier physical and electronic media, I think that Kay provides us  with the best theoretical perspective.  “Simulation is the central notion of   the Dynabook”  While Alan Kay articulated his ideas in a number of articles and  talks,  his  1977  article  co-authored  with  one  of  his  main  PARC  collaborators, computer scientist Adele Goldberg, is a particularly  useful resource if we want to understand contemporary computa- tional media. In this article Kay and Goldberg describe the vision  of  the  Learning  Research  Group  at  PARC  in  the  following  way:  to create “a personal dynamic medium the size of a notebook  the  Dynabook   which  could  be  owned  by  everyone  and  could  have  the power to handle virtually all of its owner’s information-related  needs.”11  The actual Alto computer built at Xerox PARC was the  size  of  later  PCs;  the  article  strategically  refers  to  it  as  “interim  dynabook.”   Kay  and  Goldberg  ask  the  readers  to  imagine  that  this  device  “had  enough  power  to  outrace  your  senses  of  sight  and hearing, enough capacity to store for later retrieval thousands  of page-equivalents of reference materials, poems, letters, recipes,  records, drawings, animations, musical scores, waveforms, dynamic  simulations  and  anything  else  you  would  like  to  remember  and  change.”12    In  my  view,  “all”  in  the  first  statement  is  important:  it  means  that  the  Dynabook—or  computational  media  environment  in  general,  regardless  of  the  size  of  a  form  of  device  in  which  it   10 Ibid., p. 393. 11 Ibid., p. 393. The emphasis in this and all following quotes from this article is  mine—L. M. 12 Ibid., p. 394.      ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    65  is  implemented—should  support  viewing,  creating  and  editing  all  possible  media  traditionally  used  for  human  expression  and  communication.  Accordingly,  while  separate  programs  to  create  works  in  different  media  were  already  in  existence,  Kay’s  group  for  the  first  time  implemented  them  all  together  within  a  single  machine.  In  other  words,  Kay’s  paradigm  was  not  to  simply  create  a  new  type  of  computer-based  media  that  would  co-exist  with  other  physical  media.  Rather,  the  goal  was  to  establish  a  computer  as  an  umbrella,  a  platform  for  all  existing  expressive  artistic media.  At the end of the article Kay and Goldberg give a  name for this platform, calling it a “metamedium.”  This paradigm  changes  our  understanding  of  what  media  is.  From  Gotthold  Ephraim  Lessing’s  Laocoon;  or,  On  the  Limits  of  Painting  and  Poetry  1766  to Nelson Goodman’s Languages of Art  1968 , the  modern  discourse  about  media  depends  on  the  assumption  that  different  mediums  have  distinct  properties  and  in  fact  should  be  understood in opposition to each other. Putting all mediums within  a single computer environment does not necessarily erase all differ- ences  in  what  various  mediums  can  represent  and  how  they  are  perceived—but it does bring them closer to each other in a number  of ways. Some of these new connections were already apparent to  Kay  and  his  colleagues;  others  became  visible  only  decades  later  when the new logic of media set in place at PARC unfolded more  fully; some may still not be visible to us today because they have  not been given practical realization. One obvious example of such  connections is the emergence of multimedia as a standard form of  communication: web pages, PowerPoint presentations, multimedia  artwork,  mobile  multimedia  messages,  media  blogs,  and  other  communication forms which combine multiple mediums. Another  is the adoption of common interface conventions and tools which  we use in working with different types of media regardless of their  origin:  for  instance,  a  virtual  camera,  a  magnifying  lens,  and  of  course the omnipresent copy, cut and paste commands. Yet another  is  the  ability  to  map  one  media  into  another  using  appropriate  software—images into sound, sound into images, quantitative data  into a 3D shape or sound, etc.—used widely today in such areas  as DJ VJ live cinema performances and information visualization.  All in all, it is as though different media are actively trying to reach  towards each other, exchanging properties and letting each other  borrow their unique features.  This situation is the direct opposite    66   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  “Kids learning to use the interim Dynabook.”  The original caption from  the article.

Alan Turing theoretically defined a computer as a machine that  can  simulate  a  very  large  class  of  other  machines,  and  it  is  this  simulation  ability  that  is  largely  responsible  for  the  proliferation  of computers in modern society. But as I have already mentioned,  neither  he  nor  other  theorists  and  inventors  of  digital  computers  explicitly considered that this simulation could also include media.  It  was  only  Kay  and  his  generation  that  extended  the  idea  of  simulation to media—thus turning Universal Turing Machine into  a Universal Media Machine, so to speak.    Accordingly,  Kay  and  Goldberg  write:  “In  a  very  real  sense,  simulation  is  the  central  notion  of  the  Dynabook.”13  When  we  use  computers  to  simulate  some  process  in  the  real  world—the  behavior  of  a  weather  system,  the  processing  of  information  in  the brain, the deformation of a car in a crash—our concern is to  correctly model the necessary features of this process or system. We  want to be able to test how our model would behave in different  conditions with different data, and the last thing we want to do is  for  computers  to  introduce  some  new  properties  into  the  model  that we ourselves did not specify. In short, when we use computers  as a general-purpose medium for simulation, we want this medium  to be completely “transparent.”    But  what  happens  when  we  simulate  different  media  in  a  computer?  In  this  case,  the  appearance  of  new  properties  may  be  welcome  as  they  can  extend  the  expressive  and  communi- cation  potential  of  these  media.  Appropriately,  when  Kay  and  his  colleagues  created  computer  simulations  of  existing  physical  media—i.e. the tools for representing, creating, editing, and viewing  these media—they “added” many new properties. For instance, in  the case of a book, Kay and Goldberg point out “It need not be  treated as a simulated paper book since this is a new medium with  new  properties.  A  dynamic  search  may  be  made  for  a  particular  context. The non-sequential nature of the file medium and the use  of  dynamic  manipulation  allow  a  story  to  have  many  accessible  points of view.”14 Kay and his colleagues also added various other   13 Ibid., p. 399. 14 Ibid., p. 395.       ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    71  properties to the computer simulation of paper documents. As Kay  has referred to this in another article, his idea was not to simply  imitate paper but rather to create “magical paper.”15 For instance,  the  PARC  team  gave  users  the  ability  to  modify  the  fonts  in  a  document  and  create  new  fonts.  They  also  implemented  another  important  idea  that  had  already  been  developed  by  Douglas  Engelbart’s team in the 1960s: the ability to create different views  of the same structure  I will discuss this in more detail below . And  both  Engelbart  and  Ted  Nelson  had  already  “added”  something  else: the ability to connect different documents or different parts of  the same document through hyperlinking—i.e. what we now know  as  hypertext  and  hypermedia.  Engelbart’s  group  also  developed  the ability for multiple users to collaborate on the same document.  This  list  goes  on  and  on:  e-mail  in  1965,  newsgroups  in  1979,  World Wide Web in 1990, etc.   Each  of  these  new  properties  had  far-reaching  consequences.  Take Search, for instance. Although the ability to search through  a  page-long  text  document  does  not  sound  like  a  very  radical  innovation, as the document gets longer this ability becomes more  and  more  important.  It  becomes  absolutely  crucial  if  we  have  a  very  large  collection  of  documents—such  as  all  the  web  pages  on  the  Web.  Although  current  search  engines  are  far  from  being  perfect and new technologies will continue to evolve, imagine how  different the culture of the Web would be without them.    Or take the capacity to collaborate on the same document s  by  a  number  of  users  connected  to  the  same  network.  While  it  was  already widely used by companies in the 1980s and 1990s, it was  not until the early 2000s that the wider public saw the real cultural  potential of this “addition” to print media. By harvesting the small  amounts of labor and expertise contributed by a large number of  volunteers, social software projects—most famously, Wikipedia— created vast and dynamically updatable pools of knowledge which  would be impossible to create in traditional ways.  In a less visible  way,  every  time  we  do  a  search  on  the  Web  and  then  click  on  some of the results, we also contribute to a knowledge-set used by  everybody else. In deciding in which sequence to present the results  of a particular search, Google’s algorithms take into account which   15 Alan Kay, “User Interface: A Personal View,” p. 199.   72   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  among the results of previous searches for the same words people  found most useful.    Studying  the  writings  and  public  presentations  of  the  people  who invented interactive media computing—Sutherland, Engelbart,  Nelson, Negroponte, Kay, and others—makes it clear that they did  not produce the new properties of computational media as an after- thought. On the contrary, they knew that they were turning physical  media into new media. In 1968 Engelbart gave his famous demo at  the Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco before a few  thousand people that included computer scientists, IBM engineers,  people  from  other  companies  involved  in  computers,  and  funding  officers from various government agencies.16 Although Engelbart had  only ninety minutes, he had a lot to show. Over the few previous years,  his team at The Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect  had essentially developed the modern office environment as it exists  today  not be confused with the modern media design environment  which was developed later at PARC . Their NLS computer system  included  word  processing  with  outlining  features,  documents  connected  through  hypertext,  online  collaboration   two  people  at  remote locations working on the same document in real-time , online  user manuals, online project planning systems, and other elements of  what is now called “computer-supported collaborative work.” The  team also developed the key elements of modern user interface that  were later refined at PARC: a mouse and multiple windows.    Paying attention to the sequence of the demo reveals that while  Engelbart had to make sure that his audience would be able to relate  the  new  computer  system  to  what  they  already  knew  and  used,  his   focus was on new features of simulated media never before available  previously.17  Engelbart  devotes  the  first  segment  of  the  demo  to  word processing, but as soon as he briefly demonstrated text entry,  cut, paste, insert, naming and saving files—in other words, the set  of tools which make a computer into a more versatile typewriter—   16 M.

A text file  could  be  sorted  in  different  ways.  It  could  also  be  organized  as  a  hierarchy  with  a  number  of  levels,  as  in  outline  processors  or  outlining mode of contemporary word processors such as Microsoft  Word. For example, a list of items can be organized by categories  and individual categories can be collapsed and expanded.   Engelbart next shows another example of view control, which  today, forty-five years after his demo, is still not available in popular  document management software. He makes a long “to do” list and  organizes it by locations. He then instructs the computer to display  these  locations  as  a  visual  graph   a  set  of  points  connected  by  lines.  In front of our eyes, representation in one medium changes  into  another  medium—text  becomes  a  graph.  But  this  is  not  all.  The  user  can  control  this  graph  to  display  different  amounts  of  information—something that no image in physical media can do.  As  Engelbart  clicks  on  different  points  in  a  graph  corresponding  to  particular  locations,  the  graph  shows  the  appropriate  part  of  his  “to  do”  list.   This  ability  to  interactively  change  how  much  and what information an image shows is particularly important in  today’s information visualization applications.    Next Engelbart presents “a chain of views” which he prepared  beforehand. He switches between these views using “links” which  may look like hyperlinks the way they exist on the Web today—but  they actually have a different function. Instead of creating a path  between  many  different  documents  à  la  Vannevar  Bush’s  Memex   often  seen  as  the  precursor  to  modern  hypertext ,  Engelbart  is  using links as a method for switching between different views of a  single document organized hierarchically. He brings a line of words  displayed in the upper part of the screen; when he clicks on these  words,  more  detailed  information  is  displayed  in  the  lower  part  of the screen. This information can in turn contain links to other  views that show even more detail.18   18 For  the  detailed  descriptions  of  these  and  other  capabilities  of  NLS,  see  Augmentation  Research  Center,  “NLS  User  Training  Guide,”  Stanford  Research  Institute: Menlo Park, California , 1997, http:  bitsavers.org pdf sri arc NLS_User_ Training_Guide_Apr77.pdf   74   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Examples of “view control” as implemented in NLS.

Text  and graphics were traced from the original video of Engelbart’s 1968  demo.       ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    75    Rather  than  using  links  to  drift  through  the  textual  universe  associatively  and  “horizontally,”  we  move  “vertically”  between  more  general  and  more  detailed  information.  Appropriately,  in  Engelbart’s paradigm, we are not “navigating”—we are “switching  views.”  We  can  create  many  different  views  of  the  same  infor- mation  and  switch  between  these  views  in  different  ways.  And  this is what Engelbart systematically explains in this first part of  his demo. He demonstrates that you can change views by issuing  commands, by typing numbers that correspond to different parts  of a hierarchy, by clicking on parts of a picture, or on links in the  text.  In 1967 Ted Nelson articulated and named a similar idea of a  type of hypertext, which would allow a reader to “obtain a greater  detail on a specific subject.” He named it “stretchtext.”19    Since  new  media  theory  and  criticism  emerged  in  the  early  1990s,  endless  texts  have  been  written  about  interactivity,  hypertext,  virtual  reality,  cyberspace,  cyberculture,  cyborgs,  and  so on. But I have never seen anybody discuss “view control.” And  yet this is one of the most fundamental and radical new techniques  for working with information and media available to us today. It  is  used  daily  by  each  of  us  numerous  times.  “View  control,”  i.e.  the abilities to switch between many different views and kinds of  views  of  the  same  information  is  now  implemented  in  multiple  ways not only in OS, word processors and email clients, but also  in all “media processors”  i.e. media editing software : AutoCAD,  Maya,  After  Effects,  Final  Cut,  Photoshop,  InDesign,  and  so  on.  For instance, in the case of 3D software, it can usually display the  model in at least half a dozen different ways: in wireframe, fully  rendered, etc. In the case of animation and visual effects software,  since a typical project may contain dozens of separate objects each  having dozens of parameters, it is often displayed in a way similar  to how outline processors can show text. In other words, the user  can  switch  between  more  and  less  information.  You  can  choose  to  see  only  those  parameters  which  you  are  working  on  right  now.  You  can  also  zoom  in  and  out  of  the  composition.  When  you  do  this,  parts  of  the  composition  do  not  simply  get  smaller  or bigger—they show less or more information automatically. For  instance, at a certain scale you may only see the names of different   19 Ted  Nelson,  “Stretchtext”   Hypertext  Note  8 ,  1967,  http:  xanadu.com  XUarchive htn8.tif   76   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  View control as implemented in Macintosh System software, 1984.

Let  us  look  at  another  example—Ted  Nelson’s  concept  of  hypertext that he developed in the early 1960s  independently but  parallel to Engelbart .20 In his 1965 article A File Structure for the  Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate, Nelson discusses  the limitations of books and other paper-based systems for organ- izing information and then introduces his new concept:  However, with the computer-driven display and mass memory,  it  has  become  possible  to  create  a  new,  readable  medium,  for  education and enjoyment, that will let the reader find his level,  suit his taste, and find the parts that take on special meaning for  him, as instruction and enjoyment.  Let  me  introduce  the  word  “hypertext”  to  mean  a  body  of  written or pictorial material interconnected in such a complex  way that it could not be conveniently presented or represented  on paper.21  “A new, readable medium”—these words make it clear that Nelson  was not simply interested in “patching up” books and other paper  documents.  Instead,  he  wanted  to  create  something  distinctively  new.  But  was  not  hypertext  as  proposed  by  Nelson  simply  an  extension  of  older  textual  practices  such  as  exegesis   extensive  interpretations  of  holy  scriptures  such  as  the  Bible,  Talmud,  Qur’ān ,  annotations,  or  footnotes?  While  such  historical  prece- dents  for  hypertext  are  often  proposed,  they  mistakenly  equate  Nelson’s proposal with a very limited form in which hypertext is  experienced by most people today—i.e., the World Wide Web. As  Noah  Wardrip-Fruin  pointed  out,  “The  Web  implemented  only   20 Douglas C. Engelbart, Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework   Stanford  Research  Institute,  1962 ,  http:  www.dougengelbart.org pubs augment- 3906.html. Although the implementation of hypertext in Engelbart’s NLS was much  more limited than Nelson’s concept of hypertext, looking at Engelbart’s discussion  in Augmenting Human Intellect shows that his ideas for new systems for organizing  information were at least as rich as Nelson’s.  21 Theodor H. Nelson, “A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the  Indeterminate”  1965 , in New Media Reader, p. 144.       ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    79  one  of  many  types  of  structures  proposed  by  Nelson  already  in  1965—‘chunk style’ hypertext—static links that allow the user to  jump from page to page.”22    Following  the  Web  implementation,  most  people  today  think  of hypertext as a body of text connected through one-directional  links. However, the terms “links” does not even appear in Nelson’s  original  definition  of  hypertext.  Instead,  Nelson  talks  about  new  complex interconnectivity without specifying any particular mecha- nisms  that  can  be  employed  to  achieve  it.  A  particular  system  proposed  in  Nelson’s  1965  article  is  one  way  to  implement  such  a vision, but as his definition implicitly suggests, many others are  also possible.   “What  kind  of  structures  are  possible  in  hypertext?”  asks  Nelson in a research note from 1967. He answers his own question  in  a  short  but  very  suggestive  manner:  “Any.”23  Nelson  goes  on  to explain: “Ordinary text may be regarded as a special case—the  simple  and  familiar  case—of  hypertext,  just  as  three-dimensional  space  and  the  ordinary  cube  are  the  simple  and  familiar  special  cases  of  hyperspace  and  hypercube.”24   In  2007  Nelson  re-stated  this idea in the following way: “ ‘Hypertext’—a word I coined long  ago—is not technology but potentially the fullest generalization of  documents and literature.”25     If  “hypertext”  does  not  simply  mean  “links,”  it  also  does  not  only  mean  “text.”  Although  in  its  later  popular  use  the  word  “hypertext” came to refer to linked text, as one can see from the  quote above, Nelson included “pictures” in his definition of hyper- text.26  And  in  the  following  paragraph,  he  introduces  the  terms  hyperfilm and hypermedia:   22 Noah Wardrip-Fruin, introduction to Theodor H. Nelson, “A File Structure for  the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate”  1965 , in New Media Reader,  p. 133. 23 Ted Nelson, “Brief Words on the Hypertext”  Hypertext Note 1 , 1967, http:   xanadu.com XUarchive htn1.tif 24 Ibid. 25 Ted Nelson, http:  transliterature.org   version TransHum-D23, 07.06.17 . 26 In his presentation at the 2004 Digital Retroaction symposium Noah Wardrip- Fruin  stressed  that  Nelson’s  vision  included  hypermedia  and  not  only  hypertext.  Noah Wardrip-Fruin, presentation at Digital Retroaction: a Research Symposium,  UC  Santa  Barbara,  September  17–19,  2005,  http:  dc-mrg.english.ucsb.edu  conference D_Retro conference.html   80   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Films,  sound  recordings,  and  video  recordings  are  also  linear  strings, basically for mechanical reasons. But these, too, can now  be arranged as non-linear systems – for instance, lattices – for  educational purposes, or for display with different emphasis…  The hyperfilm – a browsable or vari-sequenced movie – is only  one of the possible hypermedia that require our attention.”27  Where is hyperfilm today, almost 50 years after Nelson articulated  this concept? If we understand hyperfilm in the same limited sense  as hypertext is understood today—shots connected through links  which  a  user  can  click  on—it  would  seems  that  hyperfilm  never  fully  took  off.  A  number  of  early  pioneering  projects—Aspen  Movie  Map   Architecture  Machine  Group,  1978–9 ,  Earl  King  and  Sonata   Grahame  Weinbren,  1983–5;  1991–3 ,  CD-ROMs  by  Bob  Stein’s  Voyager  Company,  and  Wax:  Or  the  Discovery  of  Television  Among  the  Bees   David  Blair,  1993 —have  not  been  followed  up.  Similarly,  interactive  movies  and  FMV-games  created  by  the  video  game  industry  in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s  soon fell out of favor, replaced by 3D games  which offered more  interactivity .  But  if  instead  we  think  of  hyperfilm  in  a  broader  sense,  as  it  was  conceived  by  Nelson—any  interactive  structure  for connecting video or film elements, with a traditional film being  a  special  case—we  realize  that  hyperfilm  is  much  more  common  today than it may appear. Numerous interactive Flash and HTML5  sites which use video, video clips with markers which allow a user  jump to a particular point in a video  for instance, see the videos on  TED.com28 , and database cinema29 are just some of the examples  of hyperfilm today.    Decades before hypertext and hypermedia became the common  ways  for  interacting  with  information,  Nelson  understood  well  what these ideas meant for our well-established cultural practices  and concepts. The announcement for his January 5, 1965 lecture at  Vassar College talks about this in terms that are even more relevant  today than they were then: “The philosophical consequences of all  this are very grave. Our concepts of ‘reading’, ‘writing’, and ‘book’  fall  apart,  and  we  are  challenged  to  design  ‘hyperfiles’  and  write   27 Nelson, A File Structure, p. 144. 28 www.ted.com  March 8, 2008 . 29 See http:  softcinema.net form.htm      ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    81  ‘hypertext’ that may have more teaching power than anything that  could ever be printed on paper.”30   These statements align Nelson’s thinking and work with artists  and theorists who similarly wanted to destabilize the conventions  of  cultural  communication.  Digital  media  scholars  extensively  discussed  parallels  between  Nelson  and  French  theorists  writing  during  the  1960s—Roland  Barthes,  Michel  Foucault  and  Jacque  Derrida.31  Others  have  pointed  out  close  parallels  between  the  thinking  of  Nelson  and  literary  experiments  taking  place  around  the  same  time,  such  as  works  by  Oulipo.32   We  can  also  note  the  connection  between  Nelson’s  hypertext  and  the  non-linear  structure of the films of French filmmakers who set out to question  the classical narrative style: Hiroshima Mon Amour, Last Year at  Marienbad, Breathless and others .    How far shall we take these parallels? In 1987 Jay Bolter and  Michael Joyce wrote that hypertext could be seen as “a continu- ation of the modern ‘tradition’ of experimental literature in print”  which  includes  “modernism,  futurism,  Dada  surrealism,  lettrism,  the nouveau roman, concrete poetry.”33 Refuting their claim, Espen  J. Aarseth has argued that hypertext is not a modernist structure  per  se,  although  it  can  support  modernist  poetics  if  the  author  desires  this.34  Who  is  right?  Since  this  book  argues  that  cultural  software  turned  media  into  metamedia—a  fundamentally  new  semiotic  and  technological  system  which  includes  most  previous  media  techniques  and  aesthetics  as  its  elements—I  also  think  that  hypertext  is  actually  quite  different  from  modernist  literary  tradition.  I  agree  with  Aarseth  that  hypertext  is  indeed  much  more general than any particular poetics such as modernist ones.   30 Announcement of Ted Nelson’s lecture at Vassar College, January 5, 1965, http:   xanadu.com XUarchive ccnwwt65.tif 31 George  Landow,  ed.,  Hypertext:  The  Convergence  of  Contemporary  Critical  Theory  and  Technology   The  Johns  Hopkins  University  Press,  1991 ;  Jay  Bolter,  The writing space: the computer, hypertext, and the history of writing  Hillsdale,  NJ: L.

Importantly,  this  statement  is  echoed  in  Kay  and  Goldberg’s  definition  of  the  computer  as  a  “metamedium”  whose  content  is  “a wide range of already-existing and not-yet-invented media.”    What  about  the  scholars  who  see  the  strong  connections  between the thinking of Nelson and modernism? Although Nelson  says that hypertext can support any information structure and that  this information does not need to be limited to text, his examples  and  his  style  of  writing  show  an  unmistakable  aesthetic  sensi- bility—that  of  literary  modernism.  He  clearly  dislikes  “ordinary  text.”  The  emphasis  on  complexity  and  interconnectivity  and  on  breaking  up  conventional  units  for  organizing  information  such  as  a  page  clearly  aligns  Nelson’s  proposal  for  hypertext  with  the  early  twentieth-century  experimental  literature—the  inven- tions  of  Virginia  Woolf,  James  Joyce,  the  Surrealists,  etc.  This  connection  to  literature  is  not  accidental  since  Nelson’s  original  motivation  for  his  research  that  led  to  hypertext  was  to  create  a  system  for  handling  both  the  notes  for  literary  manuscripts  and  those manuscripts themselves. Nelson also already knew about the  writings of William Burroughs. The very title of the article—A File  Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate— would  make  the  perfect  title  for  an  early  twentieth-century  avant-garde  manifesto,  as  long  as  we  substitute  “file  structure”  with some “ism.”    Nelson’s  modernist  sensibility  also  shows  itself  in  his  thinking  about  new  mediums  that  can  be  established  with  the  help  of  a  computer.  However,  his  work  should  not  be  seen  as  a  simple  continuation  of  modernist  tradition.  Rather,  both  his  and  Kay’s  research  represent  the  next  stage  of  the  avant-garde  project.  The  early  twentieth-century  avant-garde  artists  were  primarily  interested  in  questioning  conventions  of  established  media  such  as  photography,  print,  graphic  design,  cinema,  and  architecture.  Thus,  no  matter  how  unconventional  the  paintings  that  came  out from Futurism, Orphism, Suprematism or De Stijl were, their  manifestos  were  still  talking  about  them  as  paintings—rather  than as a new media. In contrast, Nelson and Kay explicitly write  about  creating  new  media,  not  only  changing  the  existing  ones.  Nelson: “With the computer-driven display and mass memory, it       ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    83  has become possible to create a new, readable medium.” Kay and  Goldberg: “It [computer text] need not be treated as a simulated  paper book since this is a new medium with new properties.”    Another  key  difference  between  how  modernist  artists  and  pioneers  of  cultural  software  approached  the  job  of  inventing  new  media  and  extending  existing  ones  is  captured  by  the  title  of  Nelson’s  article  I  have  been  already  quoting  above:  “A  File  Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate.”  Instead  of  a  particular  modernist  “ism,”  we  get  a  file  structure.  Cubism,  Expressionism,  Futurism,  Orphism,  Suprematism,  and  Surrealism  proposed  new  distinct  systems  for  organizing  infor- mation,  with  each  system  fighting  all  others  for  the  dominance  in  the  cultural  memesphere.  In  contrast,  Bush,  Licklider,  Nelson,  Engelbart,  Kay,  Negroponte,  and  their  colleagues  created  meta- systems  that  can  support  many  kinds  of  information  structures.  Kay called such a system “a first metamedium,” Nelson referred to  it as hypertext and hypermedia, Engelbart wrote about “automated  external symbol manipulation” and “bootstrapping,”—but behind  the  differences  in  their  visions  lay  the  similar  understanding  of  the radically new potential offered by computers for information  manipulation.  The  prefixes  “meta-”  and  “hyper-”  used  by  Kay  and  Nelson  were  the  appropriate  characterizations  for  a  system  which was more than another new medium that could remediate  other media in its particular ways. Instead, the new system would  be capable of simulating all these media with all their remediation  strategies—as  well  as  supporting  development  of  what  Kay  and  Goldberg  referred  to  as  new  “not-yet-invented  media.”  And  of  course, this was not all. Equally important was the role of inter- activity.  The  new  meta-systems  proposed  by  Nelson,  Kay  and  others  were  to  be  used  interactively  to  support  the  processes  of  thinking,  discovery,  decision  making,  and  creative  expression.  In  contrast, the aesthetics created by modernist movements could be  understood as “information formatting” systems—to be used for  selecting and organizing information into fixed presentations that  are  then  distributed  to  the  users,  not  unlike  PowerPoint  slides.  Finally, at least in Kay’s and Nelson’s vision, the task of defining  new information structures and media manipulation techniques— and, in fact, new media as a whole—was given to the user, rather  than  being  the  sole  province  of  the  designers.  This  decision  had  far-reaching consequences for shaping contemporary culture. Once    84   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  computers  and  programming  were  democratized  enough,  many  creative people started to focus on creating these new structures and  techniques rather than using the existing ones to make “content.”  Since  the  end  of  2000,  extending  the  computer  metamedium  by  writing  new  software,  plugins,  programming  libraries  and  other  tools became the new cutting-edge type of cultural activity – giving  a new meaning to McLuhan’s famous formula “the medium is the  message.”   Today a typical article in computer science or information science  will not be talking about inventing a “new medium” as a justifi- cation for research. Instead, it is likely to refer to previous work  in some field or sub-field of computer science such as “knowledge  discovery,” “data mining,” “semantic web,” etc. It can also refer to  existing social and cultural practices and industries—for instance,  “e-learning,” “video game development,” “collaborative tagging,”  or “massively distributed collaboration.” In either case, the need  for new research is justified by a reference to already established or  popular practices—academic paradigms which have been funded,  large-scale  industries,  and  mainstream  social  routines  which  do  not  threaten  or  question  the  existing  social  order.  This  means  that practically all of computer science research which deals with  media—web technologies, media computing, hypermedia, human- computer  interfaces,  computer  graphics,  and  so  on—is  oriented  towards “mainstream” media usage.    In  other  words,  either  computer  scientists  are  trying  to  make  more  efficient  the  technologies  already  used  in  media  industries   video  games,  web  search  engines,  film  production,  etc.   or  they  are inventing new technologies that are likely to be used by these  industries in the future. The invention of new mediums for its own  sake  is  not  something  which  anybody  is  likely  to  pursue,  or  get  funded. From this perspective, the software industry and business  in  general  is  often  more  innovative  than  academic  computer  science. For instance, social media applications  Wikipedia, Flickr,  YouTube, Facebook, del.icio.us, Digg, etc.  were not invented in the  academy;  nor  were  HyperCard,  QuickTime,  HTML,  Photoshop,  After  Effects,  Flash,  or  Google  Earth.  This  was  no  different  in  previous decades. It is, therefore, not accidental that the careers of  both Ted Nelson and Alan Kay were spent in the industry and not  the academy: Kay worked for and was a fellow at Xerox PARC,  Atari,  Apple  and  Hewlett-Packard;  Nelson  was  a  consultant  and       ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    85  a  fellow  at  Bell  Laboratories,  Datapoint  Corporation,  Autodesk;  both were also associated with Disney.   Why did Nelson and Kay find more support in industry than in  academia for their quest to invent new computer media? And why  is the industry  by which I simply mean any entity which creates  the products which can be sold in large quantities, or monetized  in other ways, regardless of whether this entity is a large multina- tional company or a small start-up —more interested in innovative  media  technologies,  applications,  and  content  than  computer  science?  The  systematic  answer  to  this  question  will  require  its  own investigation. Also, what kinds of innovations each modern  institution  can  support  changes  over  time.  But  here  is  one  brief  answer:  modern  business  thrives  on  creating  new  markets,  new  products, and new product categories. Although the actual devel- opment of such new markets and products is always risky, it is also  very profitable. This was already the case in the previous decades  when Nelson and Kay were supported by Xerox, Atari, Apple, Bell  Labs, Disney, etc. In the 2000s, following the globalization of the  1990s,  all  areas  of  business  embraced  innovation  to  an  unprec- edented  degree;  this  pace  quickened  around  2005  as  companies  fully  focused  on  competing  for  new  consumers  in  China,  India,  and other “emerging” economies. Around the same time, we saw  a similar increase in the number of innovative products in the IT  industry: open APIs of leading Web 2.0 sites, daily announcements  of new web services, locative media applications, new innovative  products such as iPhone, new paradigms in imaging such as HDR  and  non-destructive  editing,  the  beginnings  of  a  “long  tail”  for  software, open source hardware, and so on.    As  we  can  see  from  the  examples  we  have  analyzed,  the  aim  of  the  inventors  of  computational  media—Engelbart,  Nelson,  Kay  and  the  people  who  worked  with  them—was  not  simply  to  create  accurate  simulations  of  physical  media.  Instead,  in  every  case the goal was to create “a new medium with new properties”  which  would  allow  people  to  communicate,  learn,  and  create  in  new  ways.  So  while  today  the  content  of  these  new  media  may  often  look  the  same  as  that  of  its  predecessors,  we  should  not  be  fooled  by  this  similarity.  The  newness  lies  not  in  the  content  but  in  the  software  tools  used  to  create,  edit,  view,  distribute,  and share this content. Therefore, rather than only looking at the  “output” of software-based cultural practices, we need to consider    86   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  software  itself—since  it  allows  people  to  work  with  media  in  a  number of historically unprecedented ways. So while on the level  of  appearance  computational  media  indeed  often  remediate   i.e.  represent  previous media, the software environment in which this  media “lives” is very different.    Let  me  add  two  more  examples.  One  is  Ivan  Sutherland’s  Sketchpad   1962 .  Created  by  Sutherland  as  a  part  of  his  PhD  thesis at MIT, Sketchpad deeply influenced all subsequent work in  computational  media   including  that  of  Kay   not  only  because  it  was the first interactive media authoring program but also because  it made it clear that computer simulations of physical media can  add  many  exciting  new  properties  to  the  media  being  simulated.  Sketchpad was the first software that allowed its users to interac- tively  create  and  modify  line  drawings.  As  Noah  Wardrip-Fruin  pointed out, it “moved beyond paper by allowing the user to work  at  any  of  2000  levels  of  magnification—enabling  the  creation  of  projects  that,  in  physical  media,  would  either  be  unwieldy  large  or require detail work at an impractically small size.”35 Sketchpad  similarly redefined graphical elements of a design as objects which  “can be manipulated, constrained, instantiated, represented ironi- cally,  copied,  and  recursively  operated  upon,  even  recursively  merged.’36  For  instance,  if  the  designer  defined  new  graphical  elements as instances of a master element and later made a change  to the master, all these instances would also change automatically.    Another  new  property,  which  perhaps  demonstrated  most  dramatically  how  computer-aided  drafting  and  drawing  were  different  from  their  physical  counterparts,  was  Sketchpad’s  use  of  constraints.  In  Sutherland’s  own  words,  “The  major  feature  which distinguishes a Sketchpad drawing from a paper and pencil  drawing is the user’s ability to specify to Sketchpad mathematical  conditions  on  already  drawn  parts  of  his  drawing  which  will  be  automatically satisfied by the computer to make the drawing take  the exact shape desired.”37 For instance, if a user drew a few lines,  and then gave the appropriate command, Sketchpad automatically   35 Noah  Wardrip-Fruin,  introduction  to  “Sketchpad.  A  Man-Machine  Graphical  Communication System,” in New Media Reader, 1963, p. 109. 36 Ibid. 37 Ivan  Sutherland,  “Sketchpad.  A  Man-Machine  Graphical  Communication  System,”  Proceedings  of  the  AFIPS  Spring  Joint  Computer  Conference,  Detroit,       ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    87  Frames from Sketchpad demo video illustrating the program’s use of  constraints. Left column: a user selects parts of a drawing. Right column:  Sketchpad automatically adjusts the drawing.  The captured frames were  edited in Photoshop to show the Sketchpad screen more clearly.    88   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  moved these lines until they were parallel to each other. If a user  gave a different command and selected a particular line, Sketchpad  moved the lines in such a way so they would parallel to each other  and perpendicular to the selected line.    Although we have not exhausted the list of new properties that  Sutherland  built  into  Sketchpad,  it  should  be  clear  that  this  first  interactive graphical editor was not only simulating existing media.  Appropriately,  Sutherland’s  1963  paper  on  Sketchpad  repeatedly  emphasizes the new graphical capacities of his system, marveling  how it opens new fields of “graphical manipulation that has never  been  available  before.”38  The  very  title  given  by  Sutherland  to  his  PhD  thesis  foregrounds  the  novelty  of  his  work:  Sketchpad:  A  man-machine  graphical  communication  system.  Rather  than  conceiving  of  Sketchpad  as  simply  another  medium,  Sutherland  presents  it  as  something  else—a  communication  system  between  two  entities:  a  human  and  an  intelligent  machine.  Kay  and  Goldberg later also foregrounded this communication dimension,  referring  to  it  as  “a  two-way  conversation”  and  calling  the  new  “metamedium”  “active.”39   We  can  also  think  of  Sketchpad  as  a  practical  demonstration  of  the  idea  of  “man-machine  symbiosis”  by J. C. R. Licklider applied to image making and design.40    My last example comes from the software development that at  first sight may appear to contradict my argument: paint software.  Surely,  the  applications  which  simulate  in  detail  the  range  of  effects made possible with various physical brushes, paint knives,  canvases,  and  papers  are  driven  by  the  desire  to  recreate  the  experience of working within an existing medium rather than the  desire to create a new one? Wrong. In 1997 an important computer  graphics pioneer Alvy Ray Smith wrote a memo titled Digital Paint  Systems:  Historical  Overview.41  In  this  text  Smith   who  himself  had a background in art  makes an important distinction between   Michigan,  May  21–3,  1963,  pp.  329–46;  in  New  Media  Reader,  Noah  Wardrip- Fruin and Nick Montfort  eds . 38 Ibid., p. 123. 39 Kay and Goldberg, “Personal Dynamic Media,” 394. 40 J.

In his definition,  “A digital paint program does essentially no more than implement  a digital simulation of classic painting with a brush on a canvas.  A  digital  paint  system  will  take  the  notion  much  farther,  using  the  “simulation  of  painting”  as  a  familiar  metaphor  to  seduce  the artist into the new digital, and perhaps forbidding, domain.”   Emphasis  in  the  original .  According  to  Smith’s  history,  most  commercial  painting  applications,  including  Photoshop,  fall  into  the paint system category. His genealogy of paint systems begins  with  Richard  Shoup’s  SuperPaint,  developed  at  Xerox  PARC  in  1972–3.42 While SuperPaint allowed the user to paint with a variety  of brushes in different colors, it also included many techniques not  possible with traditional painting or drawing tools. For instance, as  described by Shoup in one of his articles on SuperPaint, “Objects  or areas in the picture may be scaled up or down in size, moved,  copied, overlaid, combined or changed in color, and saved on disk  for future use or erased.”43    Most important, however, was the ability to grab frames from  video. Once loaded into the system, such a frame could be treated  as any other image—that is, an artist could use all of SuperPaint’s  drawing and manipulation tools, add text, combine it with other  images, etc. The system could also translate what appeared on its  screen  back  into  a  video  signal.  Accordingly,  Shoup  is  clear  that  his  system  was  much  more  than  a  way  to  draw  and  paint  with  a  computer.  In  a  1979  article,  he  refers  to  SuperPaint  as  a  new  “videographic  medium.”44  In  another  article  published  a  year  later, he refines this claim: “From a larger perspective, we realized  that the development of SuperPaint signaled the beginning of the  synergy  of  two  of  the  most  powerful  and  pervasive  technologies  ever invented: digital computing and video or television.”45   This  statement  is  amazingly  perceptive.  When  Shoup  was  writing  this  in  1980,  computer  graphics  were  used  in  television   42 Richard  Shoup,  “SuperPaint:  An  Early  Frame  Buffer  Graphics  Systems,”  IEEE  Annals  of  the  History  of  Computing  23,  issue  2   April–June  2001 ,  p.  32–7,  http:  www.rgshoup.com prof SuperPaint Annals_final.pdf;  Shoup,  “SuperPaint…The  Digital  Animator,”  Datamation   1979 ,  http:  www.rgshoup. com prof SuperPaint Datamation.pdf. 43 Shoup, “SuperPaint…The Digital Animator,” p. 152. 44 Ibid., p. 156. 45 Shoup, “SuperPaint: An Early Frame Buffer Graphics System,” p. 32.  Richard    90   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  SuperPaint menu, 1975.  broadcasts just a handful of times. And while in the next decade  their use became more common, only in the middle of the 1990s  did the synergy Shoup predicted truly became visible. As we will  see in the chapter on After Effects below, the result was a dramatic  reconfiguration not just of the visual languages of television but of  all visual techniques invented by humans up to that point. In other  words, what began as a new “videographic medium” in 1973 had  eventually changed all visual media.   But  even  if  we  forget  about  SuperPaint’s  revolutionary  ability  to  combine  graphics  and  video,  and  discount  its  new  tools  such  resizing,  moving,  copying,  etc.,  we  are  still  dealing  with  a  new  creative medium  Smith’s term . As Smith pointed out, this medium  is  the  digital  frame  buffer,46  a  special  kind  of  computer  memory   46 Alvy Ray Smith, “Digital Paint Systems: An Anecdotal and Historical Overview,”  IEEE  Annals  of  the  History  of  Computing.  2011,  http:  accad.osu.edu ~waynec  history PDFs paint.pdf      ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    91  designed to hold images represented as an array of pixels  today  a  more  common  name  is  graphics  card .  An  artist  using  a  paint  system is modifying pixel values in a frame buffer—regardless of  what particular operation or tool s he is employing at the moment.  This  opens  up  a  door  to  all  kinds  of  new  image  creation  and  modification operations, which follow different logic than physical  painting. The telling examples of this can be found in a paint system  called Paint developed by Smith in 1975–6. In Smith’s own words,  “Instead  of  just  simulating  painting  a  stroke  of  constant  color,  I  extended  the  notion  to  mean  ‘perform  any  image  manipulation  you  want  under  the  pixels  of  the  paintbrush.”47  Beginning  with  this  conceptual  generalization,  Smith  added  a  number  of  effects  which still used a paintbrush tool but actually no longer referred  to painting in a physical world. For instance, in Paint “any image  of any shape could be used as a brush.” In another example, Smith  added “‘not paint’ that reversed the color of every pixel under the  paintbrush to its color complement.” He also defined ‘smear paint’  that averaged the colors in the neighborhood of each pixel under  the  brush  and  wrote  the  result  back  into  the  pixel.”  And  so  on.  Thus, the instances where the paintbrush tool behaved more like a  real physical paintbrush were just particular cases of a much larger  universe of new behaviors made possible in a new medium.  The permanent extendibility  As we saw, Sutherland, Nelson, Engelbart, Kay, and other pioneers  of computational media have added many previously non existent  properties  to  media  that  they  have  simulated  in  a  computer.  The  subsequent  generations  of  computer  scientists,  hackers,  and  designers  added  many  more  properties—but  this  process  is  far  from  finished.  And  there  is  no  logical  or  material  reason  why  it  will  ever  be  finished.  It  is  the  “nature”  of  computational  media  that  it  is  open-ended  and  that  new  techniques  are  continuously  being invented.    To  add  new  properties  to  physical  media  requires  modifying  its  physical  substance.  But  since  computational  media  exists  as   47 Ibid., p. 18.   92   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  software, we can add new properties or even invent new types of  media by simply changing existing or writing new software. Or by  adding plug-ins and extensions, as programmers have been doing  it with Photoshop and Firefox, respectively. Or by putting existing  software  together.   For  instance,  starting  in  2006,  thousands  of  people  extended  the  capacities  of  mapping  media  by  creating  software mashups which combine the services and data provided  by Goggle Maps, Flickr, Amazon, other sites, and media uploaded  by users.   In  short,  “new  media”  is  “new”  because  new  properties   i.e.,    new  software  techniques   can  always  be  easily  added  to  it.  Put  differently,  in  industrial   i.e.  mass-produced   media  technologies,  “hardware”  and  “software”  were  one  and  the  same  thing.  For  example, the book pages were bound in a particular way that fixed  the  order  of  pages.  The  reader  could  not  change  this  order  nor  the level of detail being displayed à la Engelbart’s “view control.”  Similarly, the film projector combined hardware and what we now  call a “media player” software into a single machine. In the same  way,  the  controls  built  into  a  twentieth-century  mass-produced  camera  could  not  be  modified  at  the  user’s  will.  And  although  today the users of a digital camera similarly cannot easily modify  the hardware of their camera, as soon as they transfer the pictures  into a computer they have access to endless number of controls and  options for modifying their pictures via software.    In  the  nineteenth  and  twentieth  centuries  the  normally  rigid  industrial  media  was  fluid  in  two  situations.  First,  when  a  new  media  was  being  first  developed:  for  instance,  the  invention  of  photography  in  the  1820s–1840s.  Second,  when  artists  would  systematically  experiment  with  and  “open  up”  already  industri- alized media—such as the experiments with film and video during  the 1960s that came to be called “Expanded Cinema.”    What  used  to  be  separate  moments  of  experimentations  with  media  during  the  industrial  era  became  the  norm  in  a  software  society.  In  other  words,  the  computer  legitimizes  experimen- tation with media. Why is this so? What differentiates a modern  digital  computer  from  any  other  machine—including  industrial  media  machines  for  capturing  and  playing  media—is  separation  of  hardware  and  software.  It  is  because  an  endless  number  of  different  programs  performing  different  tasks  can  be  written  to  run on the same type of machine, that that machine—i.e. a digital       ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    93  computer—is  used  so  widely  today.  Consequently,  the  constant  invention of new  and modification of existing  media software, is  simply one example of this general principle. In its very structure  computational media is “avant-garde” since it is constantly being  extended and thus redefined.    If  in  modern  culture  “experimental”  and  “avant-garde”  were  opposed  to  normalized  and  stable,  this  opposition  largely  disap- pears in software culture. And the role of the media avant-garde  is performed no longer by individual artists in their studios but by  a variety of players, from very big to very small—from companies  such as Microsoft, Adobe, and Apple to independent programmers,  hackers, and designers.    But this process of continual invention of new algorithms does  not just move in any direction. If we look at contemporary media  software—CAD,  computer  drawing  and  painting,  image  editing,  word  processors—we  will  see  that  most  of  their  fundamental  principles were already developed by the generation of Sutherland  and  Kay.  In  fact  the  very  first  interactive  graphical  editor— Sketchpad—already  contains  most  of  the  genes,  so  to  speak,  of  contemporary  graphics  applications.  As  new  techniques  continue  to  be  invented  they  are  layered  over  the  foundations  that  were  gradually put in place by Sutherland, Engelbart, Kay, and others in  the 1960s and 1970s.    Of course we are not dealing here only with the history of ideas.  Various  social  and  economic  factors—such  as  the  dominance  of  the  media  software  market  by  a  handful  of  companies  or  the  wide adoption of particular file formats –– also constrain possible  directions  of  software  evolution.  Put  differently,  today  software  development is an industry and as such it is constantly balancing  between stability and innovation, standardization and exploration  of new possibilities. But it is not just any industry. New programs  can be written and existing programs can be extended and modified   if the source code is available  by anybody who has programming  skills  and  access  to  a  computer,  a  programming  language  and  a  compiler.  In  other  words,  today  software  is  fundamentally  malleable  in  a  way  that  twentieth-century  industrially  produced  objects were not.  The emergence of consumer 3D printing and the  “open  hardware”  movement  promise  to  bring  such  flexibility  to  physical objects as well, but it will be a while before you can print  a whole ready-to-drive-car on your home 3D printer.    94   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND    Although  Turing  and  Von  Neumann  formulated  this  funda- mental  extendibility  of  software  in  theory,  its  contemporary  practice—hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  daily  involved  in  extending  the  capabilities  of  computational  media—is  a  result  of  a long historical development. This development took us from the  few early room-sized computers, which were not easy to reprogram  to a wide availability of cheap computers and programming tools  decades later. This democratization of software development was  at  the  core  of  Kay’s  vision.  Kay  was  particularly  concerned  with  how  to  structure  programming  tools  in  such  a  way  that  would  make development of media software possible for ordinary users.  For instance, at the end of the 1977 article I have already exten- sively  quoted,  he  and  Goldberg  write,  “We  must  also  provide  enough already-written general tools so that a user need not start  from scratch for most things she or he may wish to do.”   Comparing the process of continuous media innovation via new  software to the history of earlier, pre-computational media reveals a  new logic at work. According to a commonplace idea, when a new  medium is invented it first closely imitates already existing media,  before  discovering  its  own  language  and  aesthetics.  Indeed,  the  first Gutenberg Bible closely imitated the look of the handwritten  manuscripts; early films produced in the 1890s and 1900s mimicked  the presentational format of theatre by positioning the actors on the  invisible shallow stage and having them face the audience. Slowly,  printed books developed a different way of presenting information;  similarly cinema also developed its own original concept of narrative  space. Through repetitive shifts in points of view presented in subse- quent shots, the viewers were placed inside this space—thus literally  finding themselves inside the story.    Can  this  logic  apply  to  the  history  of  computer  media?  As  theorized by Turing and Von Neumann, the computer is a general- purpose simulation machine. This is its uniqueness and its difference  from all other machines and previous media. This means that the  idea that a new medium gradually finds its own language cannot  apply  to  computer  media.  If  this  were  true  it  would  go  against  the very definition of a modern digital computer. This theoretical  argument is supported by practice. The history of computer media  so far has been not about arriving at some standardized language— as,  for  instance,  happened  with  cinema—but  rather  about  the  gradual  expansion  of  uses,  techniques,  and  possibilities.  Rather       ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    95  than arriving at a particular language, we are gradually discovering  that the computer can speak more and more languages.    If we are to look more closely at the early history of computer  media—for instance, the way we have been looking at Kay’s ideas  and work in this text—we will discover another reason why the idea  of a new medium gradually discovering its own language does not  apply to computer media. The systematic practical work on making  a  computer  simulate  and  extend  existing  media   Sutherland’s  Sketchpad,  the  first  interactive  word  processor  developed  by  Engelbart’s  group,  etc.   came  after  computers  had  already  been  put  to  multiple  uses—performing  different  types  of  calculations,  solving  mathematical  problems,  controlling  other  machines  in  real  time,  running  mathematical  simulations,  simulating  some  aspects of human intelligence, and so on.  We should also mention  the  work  on  SAGE  by  MIT  Lincoln  Laboratory  which,  by  the  middle  of  the  1950s,  had  already  established  the  idea  of  inter- active  communication  between  a  human  and  a  computer  via  a  screen  with  a  graphical  display  and  a  pointing  device.  In  fact,  Sutherland  developed  Sketchpad  on  a  TX-2,  the  new  version  of  a  larger  computer  MIT  constructed  for  SAGE.   Therefore,  when  the  generation  of  Sutherland,  Nelson,  and  Kay  started  to  create  “new media,” they built it on top, so to speak, of what computers  were  already  known  to  be  capable  of.  Consequently  they  added  new  properties  into  physical  media  they  were  simulating  right  away.  This  can  be  very  clearly  seen  in  the  case  of  Sketchpad.  Understanding  that  one  of  the  roles  a  computer  can  play  is  that  of  a  problem  solver,  Sutherland  built  in  a  powerful  new  feature  that  never  before  existed  in  a  graphical  medium—satisfaction  of  constraints.  To  rephrase  this  example  in  more  general  terms,  we  can say that rather than moving from an imitation of older media  to  finding  its  own  language,  computational  media  was  from  the  very beginning speaking a new language.    In  other  words,  the  pioneers  of  computational  media  did  not  have  the  goal  of  making  the  computer  into  a  ‘remediation  machine”  which  would  simply  represent  older  media  in  new  ways.  Instead,  knowing  well  the  new  capabilities  provided  by  digital computers, they set out to create fundamentally new kinds  of  media  for  expression  and  communication.  These  new  media  would use as their raw “content” the older media which already  served humans well for hundreds and thousands of years—written    96   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  language, sound, line drawings and design plans, and continuous  tone  images   i.e.  paintings  and  photographs .  But  this  does  not  compromise the newness of new media. Computational media uses  these traditional human media simply as building blocks to create  previously  unimaginable  representational  and  information  struc- tures, creative and thinking tools, and communication options.    Although  Sutherland,  Engelbart,  Nelson,  Kay,  and  others  developed computational media on top of already existing devel- opments  in  computational  theory,  programming  languages,  and  computer engineering, it would be incorrect to conceive the history  of  such  influences  as  only  going  in  one  direction—from  already  existing  and  more  general  computing  principles  to  particular  techniques  of  computational  media.  The  inventors  of  computa- tional media had to question many, if not most, already established  ideas about computing. They have defined many new fundamental  concepts  and  techniques  of  how  both  software  and  hardware  function,  thus  making  important  contributions  to  hardware  and  software  engineering.  A  good  example  is  Kay’s  development  of  Smalltalk,  which  for  the  first  time  systematically  established  a  paradigm  of  object-oriented  programming.  Kay’s  rationale  to  develop  this  new  programming  language  was  to  give  a  unified  appearance  to  all  applications  and  the  interface  of  the  PARC  system and, even more importantly, to enable its users to quickly  program  their  own  media  tools.   According  to  Kay,  an  object- oriented illustration program written in Smalltalk by a particularly  talented  12-year-old  girl  was  only  a  page  long.48   Subsequently  the  object-oriented  programming  paradigm  became  very  popular  and  object-oriented  features  have  been  added  to  most  popular  languages such as C.    Looking  at  the  history  of  computer  media  and  examining  the  thinking of its inventors makes it clear that we are dealing with the  opposite of technological determinism. When Sutherland designed  Sketchpad, Nelson conceived hypertext, Kay programmed a paint  program,  and  so  on,  each  new  property  of  computer  media  had  to be imagined, implemented, tested, and refined. In other words,  these  characteristics  did  not  simply  come  as  an  inevitable  result  of  a  meeting  between  digital  computers  and  modern  media.   48 Alan Kay, Doing with Images Makes Symbols  University Video Communications,  1987 , videotaped lecture, http:  archive.org details AlanKeyD1987       ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    97  Computational media had to be invented, step-by-step. And it was  invented  by  people  who  were  looking  for  inspiration  in  modern  art,  literature,  cognitive  and  education  psychology,  and  theory  of  media  as  much  as  technology.  For  example,  Kay  recalls  that  reading McLuhan’s Understanding Media led him to a realization  that  a  computer  can  be  a  medium  rather  than  only  a  tool.49  Accordingly, the opening section of Kay and Goldberg’s article is  called “Humans and Media,” and it does read like media theory.  But  this  is  not  a  typical  theory  that  only  describes  the  word,  as  it currently exists. Similar to Marx’s analysis of capitalism in his  works,  here  the  analysis  is  used  to  create  a  plan  for  action  for  building a new world—in this case, enabling people to create new  media.   But  the  most  important  example  of  such  non-deterministic  development  is  the  invention  of  the  modern  interactive  graphical  human-computer  interface  itself  by  Sutherland,  Engelbart,  Kay  and  others.  None  of  the  key  theoretical  concepts  of  modern  computing  as  developed  by  Turing  and  Von  Neumann  called  for  an  interactive  interface.  In  the  late  1940s  and  1950s  the  MIT  Lincoln  Laboratory  developed  interactive  graphical  computers  used  in  SAGE—the  control  centers  created  around  the  US  to  collect information from radar stations and coordinate a counter- attack.  But  the  SAGE  interface  was  designed  for  very  particular  tasks  and  it  had  no  effect  on  the  development  of  commercial  computing.  It  did,  however,  lead  to  a  new  smaller  machine:  the  TX-2,  used  by  young  students  at  MIT   including  Sutherland   to  explore  what  can  be  done  with  an  “interactive  computer”—i.e.  a computer which had a visual display. Some students started to  create  interactive  games  including  the  famous  Spacewar   1960 .  Sutherland  was  one  of  these  students  who  were  exploring  the  possibilities  of  visual  interactive  computing  using  the  TX-2.  He  went to create Sketchpad  his Ph.D. thesis  which influenced other  pioneers  of  cultural  computing  in  the  1960s  including  Kay.  But  the theoretical road that led from SAGE to modern GUI through  PARC was a very long one.    According  to  Kay,  the  key  step  for  him  and  his  group  was  to  start  thinking  about  computers  as  a  medium  for  learning,   49 Alan Kay, “User Interface: A Personal View,” p. 192–3.   98   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  experimentation,  and  artistic  expression  which  can  be  used  not  just by adults but also by “children of all ages.”50 Kay was strongly  influenced  by  the  theory  of  the  cognitive  psychologist  Jerome  Bruner.  Bruner  developed  his  theory  by  redefining  the  ideas  of  Jean Piaget who postulated that children go through a number of  distinctive  intellectual  stages  as  they  develop:  a  kinesthetic  stage,  a  visual  stage,  and  a  symbolic  stage.  But  while  Piaget  thought  that each stage only exists for a particular period during a child’s  development only to be completely replaced by a new stage, Bruner  suggested that separate mentalities that correspond to these stages  continue to exist as the child grows. That is, the mentalities do not  replace  each  other  but  are  added.  Bruner  gave  slightly  different  names to these different mentalities: enactive, iconic, and symbolic.  While each mentality has developed at different stages of human  evolution, they continue to co-exist in an adult.   Kay’s  interpretation  of  this  theory  was  that  a  user  interface  should  appeal  to  all  these  three  mentalities.  In  contrast  to  a  command-line  interface,  which  is  not  accessible  for  children  and  forces the adult to use only symbolic mentality, the new interface  should also make use of emotive and iconic mentalities. Kay also  drew on a number of studies on creativity in math, science, music,  art  and  other  areas  which  suggested  that  initial  creative  work  is  done  mostly  in  iconic  mentality  and  also  in  enactive.51  This  provided additional motivation for the idea that if computers were  to function as a dynamic medium for learning and creativity they  should allow their users to think not only through symbols but also  through actions and images.   Following  Kay’s  interpretation  of  Bruner’s  work,  the  group  at  PARC  mapped  Bruner’s  theory  of  multiple  mentalities  into  the  interface  technologies  in  the  following  way. Mouse  activates  enactive  mentality   know  where  you  are,  manipulate .  Icons  and  windows activate iconic mentality  recognize, compare, configure.   Finally,  Smalltalk  programming  language  allows  for  the  use   50 Alan  Kay,  “A  Personal  Computer  for  Children  of  All  Ages,”  Proceedings  of  the  ACM  National  Conference,  Boston,  1972,  http:  www.mprove.de diplom gui  kay72.html 51 Alan Kay, “User Interface: A Personal View,” p. 195.      ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    99  of  symbolic  mentality   tie  together  long  chains  of  reasoning,  abstract. 52    In actual use, a contemporary GUI involves constant interplay  between  different  mentalities.  You  use  a  mouse  to  move  around  the  screen  as  though  it  is  a  physical  space  and  point  at  screen  objects.  All  objects  are  represented  by  visual  icons.  You  double- click on an icon to activate it or, if it is a folder icon, to examine  its  contents.  This  can  be  interpreted  as  an  equivalent  of  picking  up and examining a physical object in a real world. After a folder  window  opens,  you  may  switch  between  different  views,  looking  at  the  data  as  icons  and  alternatively  as  a  list,  then  sort  the  list  in different ways to examine file names, creation dates and other  symbolic  information   i.e.  text .  If  you  did  not  find  the  files  you  were looking for, you may then use a search function to search the  whole computer—possibly defining multiple options and carefully  choosing the search terms  symbolic mentality . As these examples  demonstrate,  the  user  is  constantly  switching  between  different  mentalities using whatever works best at a given moment.    But  in  addition  to  the  general  interface  principles,  other  key  techniques that were developed by Kay’s group can also be under- stood  as  enabling  the  use  of  different  mentalities  in  combination  with each other. For instance, the user interface developed at PARC  was  the  first  to  run  on  a  bit-mapped  display—which  meant  not  only giving users the ability to move the pointer and open multiple  windows but also to write simulation programs in Smalltalk which  could display their results visually right on the screen. By making  a change in the code a user would be able to see the visual result  of this change in the image produced by the program. Today this  ability  is  fundamental  to  computer  use  in  all  areas  of  science   in  particular,  the  use  of  interactive  visualization  and  data  analysis  software . And of course, we should not forget about all the media  editors created at PARC: a paint program, an illustration program,  a music editor, etc. These media editors gave the users the ability  to  switch  between  different  mentalities  in  a  way  not  available  in  the  physical  media.  For  instance,  the  objects  in  the  animation  program could be drawn by hand or by writing code in Smalltalk.  As  Kay  and  Goldberg  point  out,  “The  control  of  the  animation   52 Ibid., p. 197.   100   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  could  be  easily  done  from  a  Smalltalk  simulation.  For  example,  an animation of objects bouncing in a room is most easily accom- plished by a few lines of Smalltalk code that express the class of  bouncing objects in physical terms.”53   In defining this new type of user interface, Kay and his collabo- rators simultaneously created a radically new type of media. If we  are to agree with Bruner’s theory of multiple mentalities and Kay’s  interpretation  of  this  theory,  we  should  conclude  that  the  new  computational  media  that  he  helped  to  invent  can  do  something  no  previous  media  can—activate  our  multiple  mentalities  which  all  play  a  role  in  learning  and  creativity,  allowing  a  user  to  employ whatever works best at any given moment and to rapidly  switch  between  them  as  necessary.  This  may  explain  the  success  and popularity of the GUI, which, forty years after its invention,  continues  to  dominate  our  interaction  with  computers.  People  prefer it not because it is “easy” or “seamless” or “intuitive.” It  is successful because it was designed to help them think, discover,  and create new concepts using not just one type of mentality but all  of them together. In short, while many HCI experts and designers  continue to believe that the ideal human-computer interface should  be  invisible  and  get  out  of  the  way  to  let  users  do  their  work,  looking at the theories of Kay and Goldberg that were behind GUI  design  gives  a  very  different  way  of  understanding  an  interface’s  identity. Kay and his colleagues at PARC have conceived GUI as a  medium designed in its every detail to facilitate learning, discovery,  and creativity.    Given the overall emphasis of information society on constant  innovation,  continuous  learning,  and  creativity,  it  is  only  appro- priate  that  as  this  society  was  coming  into  existence,  a  new  medium  was  being  invented  specifically  to  facilitate  these  needs.  In  1973  Daniel  Bell  published  his  highly  influential  The  Coming  of  Post-Industrial  Society;  right  around  that  time  at  PARC  Kay,  Goldberg,  Chuck  Thacker,  Dan  Ingalls,  Larry  Tesler,  and  other  members  of  the  Learning  Research  Group  created  the  paradigm  of modern computing. Or rather, they reinvented the computer— from  a  fast  calculator  that  can  only  work  on  tasks  articulated   53 Kay and Goldberg, “Personal Dynamic Media,” p. 399.      ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    101  beforehand  to  an  interactive  support  system  for  thinking  and  discovery. In short: from a tool to a metamedium.   Unfortunately,  when  GUI  became  the  commercially  successful  paradigm following the success of Apple’s Mac computers, intro- duced  in  1984,  the  intellectual  origins  of  GUI  were  forgotten.  Instead,  GUI  was  justified  using  a  simplistic  idea  that  since  computers  are  unfamiliar  to  people,  we  should  help  them  by  making  interface  intuitive  by  making  it  mimic  something  users  are  already  well  familiar  with—the  physical  world  outside  of  a  computer  which in reality was an office environment with folders,  desks,  printers,  etc.   Surprisingly,  even  in  recent  years–  when  “born  digital”  generations  were  already  using  computer  devices  even before they ever set foot in an office—this idea was still used  to  explain  GUI.  For  example,  Apple’s  iPhone  Human  Interface  guidelines  March 2010  advise developers: “When possible, model  your application’s objects and actions on objects and actions in the  real  world.  This  technique  especially  helps  novice  users  quickly  grasp how your application works. Folders are a classic software  metaphor.  People  file  things  in  folders  in  the  real  world,  so  they  immediately  understand  the  idea  of  putting  data  into  folders  on  a computer.”54 The irony of this statement is that these Interface  guidelines are also aimed at the developers of iPad—which clearly  represents yet another step in migration from the world of physical  print  to  all-digital  environment.  It  is  as  though  we  are  asked  to  remember and cherish the older media—and erase it at the same  time.   The computer as a metamedium  As we have established, the development of computational media  runs  contrary  to  previous  media  history.  But  in  a  certain  sense,  the  idea  of  a  new  media  gradually  discovering  its  own  language  actually  does  apply  to  the  history  of  computational  media  after  all. And just as with printed books and cinema, this process took a   54 http:  developer.apple.com iphone library documentation UserExperience  Conceptual MobileHIG PrinciplesAndCharacteristics PrinciplesAndCharacteristics. html  apple_ref doc uid TP40006556-CH7-SW1  April 5, 2010 .   102   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  few decades. When the first computers were built in the middle of  the 1940s, they could not be used as media for cultural represen- tation, expression, and communication. Slowly, through the work  of Sutherland, Engelbart, Nelson, Papert, and others in the 1960s,  the  ideas  and  techniques  were  developed  that  made  computers  into  a  cultural  machine.  One  could  create  and  edit  text,  make  drawings,  move  around  a  virtual  object,  etc.  And  finally,  when  Kay  and  his  colleagues  at  PARC  systematized  and  refined  these  techniques  and  put  them  under  the  umbrella  of  a  GUI   making  computers accessible to multitudes  a digital computer finally was  given  its  own  language—in  cultural  terms.  In  short,  only  when  a  computer  became  a  cultural  medium—rather  than  merely  a  versatile machine—could it be so used.   Or  rather,  it  became  something  that  no  other  media  had  been  before. For what had emerged was not yet another media, but as  Kay  and  Goldberg  insist  in  their  article,  something  qualitatively  different  and  historically  unprecedented.  To  mark  this  difference,  they introduce a new term—“metamedium.”   This metamedium is unique in a number of different ways. One of  them I have already discussed in detail—it can represent most other  media while augmenting them with many new properties. Kay and  Goldberg also name other properties that are equally crucial. The  new metamedium is “active—it can respond to queries and experi- ments—so that the messages may involve the learner in a two-way  conversation.”  For  Kay  who  was  strongly  interested  in  children  and  learning,  this  property  was  particularly  important  since,  as  he puts it, it “has never been available before except through the  medium of an individual teacher.” 55 Further, the new metamedium  can handle “virtually all of its owner’s information-related needs.”   I have already discussed the consequence of this property above.   It  can  also  serve  as  “a  programming  and  problem  solving  tool”  and “an interactive memory for the storage and manipulation of  data.”56 But the property that is the most important from the point  of view of media history is that the computer metamedium is simul- taneously a set of different media and a system for generating new  media tools and new types of media. In other words, a computer   55 Kay and Goldberg, “Personal Dynamic Media,” p. 394. 56 Ibid., p. 393.      ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    103  can be used to create new tools for working with the media types it  already provides as well as to develop new not-yet-invented media.  In the opening to his book Expressive Processing, Noah Wardrip-   Fruin  perfectly  articulates  this  “meta-generative”  specificity  of  computers:  A computer can simulate a typewriter—getting input from the  keyboard and arranging pixels on the screen to shape the corre- sponding  letters—but  it  can  also  go  far  beyond  a  typewriter,  offering  many  fonts,  automatic  spelling  correction,  painless  movement of manuscript sections  through simulations of “cut”  and “paste” , programmable transformations  such as “find and  replace” , and even collaborative authoring by large, dispersed  groups  as with projects like Wikipedia . This is what modern  computers   more  lengthily  called  “stored-program  electronic  digital computers”  are designed to make possible: the continual  creation  of  new  machines,  opening  new  possibilities,  through  the definition of new sets of computational processes.57  Using the analogy with print literacy, Kay motivates this property  in this way: “The ability to ‘read’ a medium means you can access  materials and tools generated by others. The ability to write in a  medium  means  you  can  generate  materials  and  tools  for  others.  You must have both to be literate.”58 Accordingly, Kay’s key effort  at  PARC  was  the  development  of  the  Smalltalk  programming  language.  All  media  editing  applications  and  the  GUI  itself  were  written  in  Smalltalk.  This  made  all  the  interfaces  of  all  applica- tions  consistent,  facilitating  quick  learning  of  new  programs.  Even  more  importantly,  according  to  Kay’s  vision,  Smalltalk  would allow even novice users to write their own tools and define  their  own  media.  In  other  words,  all  media  editing  applications  that  would  be  provided  with  a  computer,  were  to  serve  also  as  examples, inspiring users to modify them and to write their own  applications.   57 Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Expressive Processing: Digital Fictions, Computer Games,  and Software Studies  The MIT Press, 2009 . 58 Alan Kay, “User Interface: A Personal View,” in The Art of Human-Computer  Interface Design, ed. Brenda Laurel  Reading, MA, Addison-Wesley, 1990 , p. 193.  The emphasis is in the original.   104   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND    Accordingly,  the  large  part  of  Kay  and  Goldberg’s  paper  is  devoted  to  description  of  software  developed  by  the  users  of  their  system:  “an  animation  system  programmed  by  animators”,  “a  drawing  and  painting  system  programmed  by  a  child,”  “a  hospital simulation programmed by a decision-theorist,” “an audio  animation  system  programmed  by  musicians”,  “a  musical  score  capture  system  programmed  by  a  musician”,  “electronic  circuit  design  by  a  high  school  student.”  As  can  be  seen  from  this  list,   which corresponds to the sequence of examples in the article , Kay  and  Goldberg  deliberately  juxtaposed  different  types  of  users— professionals,  high  school  students,  and  children—in  order  to  show that everybody could develop new tools using the Smalltalk  programming environment.    The  sequence  of  examples  also  strategically  juxtaposes  media  simulations with other kinds of simulations in order to emphasize  that simulation of media is only a particular case of the computer’s  general ability to simulate all kinds of processes and systems. This  juxtaposition  of  examples  gives  us  an  interesting  way  to  think  about computational media. Just as a scientist may use simulation  to test different conditions and play different what if scenarios, a  designer, a writer, a musician, a filmmaker, or an architect working  with  computer  media  can  quickly  “test”  different  creative  direc- tions  in  which  the  project  can  be  developed  as  well  as  see  how  modifications of various “parameters” affect the project. The latter  is particularly easy today since the interfaces of most media editing  software  not  only  explicitly  present  these  parameters  but  also  simultaneously give the user the controls for their modification. For  instance,  when  the  Formatting  Palette  in  Microsoft  Word  shows  the  font  used  by  the  currently  selected  text,  it  is  displayed  in  a  column next to all other fonts available. Trying different fonts is as  easy as scrolling down and selecting the name of a new font.    Giving users the ability to write their own programs was a crucial  part of Kay’s vision for the new “metamedium” he was inventing  at PARC. According to Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Engelbart’s research  program was focused on a similar goal: “Engelbart envisioned users  creating  tools,  sharing  tools,  and  altering  the  tools  of  others.”59   59 Noah  Wardrip-Fruin,  introduction  to  Douglas  Engelbart  and  William  English,  “A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect”  1968 , New Media Reader,  p. 232.       ALAN  KAy’S UNIVERSAL  MEDIA  MACHINE    105  Unfortunately,  when  in  1984  Apple  shipped  Macintosh,  which  was to become the first commercially successful personal computer  modeled  after  the  PARC  system,  it  did  not  have  an  easy-to-use  programming environment. HyperCard, written for Macintosh in  1987 by Bill Atkinson  who was one of PARC’s alumni , gave users  the ability to quickly create certain kinds of applications—but it did  not have the versatility and breadth envisioned by Kay. Only more  recently, as the general computer literacy has widened and many  new  high-level  programming  languages  have  become  available— Perl,  PHP,  Python,  JavaScript,  etc.—have  more  people  started  to  create their own tools by writing software. A good example of a  contemporary  programming  environment,  very  popular  among  artists and designers and which, in my view, is close to Kay’s vision,  is  Processing.60  Built  on  top  of  the  Java  programming  language,  Processing features a simplified programming style and an extensive  library of graphical and media functions. It can be used to develop  complex programs and also to quickly test ideas. Appropriately, the  official name for Processing projects is sketches.61 In the words of  Processing inventors and main developers Ben Fry and Casey Reas,  the  language’s  focus  is  “on  the  ‘process’  of  creation  rather  than  end  results.”62  Another  popular  programming  environment  that  similarly enables quick development of media projects is Max MSP  and its successor PD—both developed by Miller Puckette.    At the end of the 1977 article that served as the basis for our  discussion  in  this  chapter,  Kay  and  Goldberg  summarize  their  arguments in the phrase—which in my view is the best formulation  we  have  had  so  far—of  what  computational  media  is  artistically  and  culturally.  They  call  the  computer  “a  metamedium”  whose  content is “a wide range of already-existing and not-yet-invented  media.”  In  another  article  published  in  1984  Kay  unfolds  this  definition.  As  a  way  of  concluding  this  chapter,  I  would  like  to  quote  this  longer  definition  which  is  as  accurate  and  inspiring  today as it was when Kay wrote it:  It [a computer] is a medium that can dynamically simulate the  details of any other medium, including media that cannot exist   60 www.processing.org 61 http:  www.processing.org reference environment  62 http:  wiki.processing.org w FAQ   106   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  physically. It is not a tool, though it can act like many tools. It  is the first metamedium, and as such it has degrees of freedom  for representation and expression never before encountered and  as yet barely investigated.63  63 Alan Kay, “Computer Software,” Scientific American  September 1984 , p. 52.  Quoted in Jean-Louis Gassée, “The Evolution of Thinking Tools,” in The Art of  Human-Computer Interface Design, p. 225.   CHAPTER TWO  Understanding metamedia  “It  [the  electronic  book]  need  not  be  treated  as  a  simulated  paper book since this is a new medium with new properties.”  Kay and Goldberg, “Personal Dynamic Media,” 1977  Today  Popular  Science,  published  by  Bonnier  and  the  largest  science+tech  magazine  in  the  world,  is  launching  Popular  Science+ — the first magazine on the Mag+ platform, and you  can get it on the iPad tomorrow…What amazes me is that you  don’t feel like you’re using a website, or even that you’re using  an e-reader on a new tablet device — which, technically, is what  it is. It feels like you’re reading a magazine.”  emphasis is in the  original.    “Popular Science+,” posted on April 2, 2010.  http:  berglondon.com blog 2010 04 02 popularscienceplus   The building blocks  I started putting this book together in 2007. Today is April 3, 2010,  and I am editing this chapter. Today is also an important day in the  history of media computing  which started exactly forty years ago  with Ivan Sutherland’s Sketchpad —Apple’s iPad tablet computer  first went on sale in the US on this date. During the years I was  writing and editing the book, many important developments made  Alan Kay’s vision of a computer as the “first metamedium” more  real—and at the same time more distant.   108   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND    The dramatic cuts in the prices of laptops and the rise of cheap  notebooks   and,  in  the  years  that  followed,  tablet  computers ,  together with the continuing increase in the capacity and decrease  in  price  of  consumer  electronics  devices   digital  cameras,  video  cameras,  media  players,  monitors,  storage,  etc.   brought  media  computing to even more people. With the price of a notebook ten or  twenty times less than the price of a large digital TV set, the 1990s’  argument about the “digital divide” became less relevant. It became  cheaper  to  create  your  own  media  than  to  consume  professional  TV  programs  via  the  industry’s  preferred  mode  of  distribution.  More  students,  designers,  and  artists  learned  Processing  and  other  specialized  programming  and  scripting  languages  specifi- cally  designed  for  their  needs—which  made  software-driven  art  and media design more common. Perhaps most importantly, most  mobile phones became “smart phones” supporting Internet connec- tivity, web browsing, email, photo and video capture, and a range  of other media creation capabilities—as well as the new platforms  for  software  development.  For  example,  Apple’s  iPhone  went  on  sale  on  June  29,  2007;  on  July  10  when  the  App  Store  opened,  it already had 500 third-party applications. According to Apple’s  statistics, on March 20, 2010 the store had over 150,000 different  applications  and  the  total  number  of  application  downloads  had  reached  3  billion.  In  February  2012,  the  numbers  of  iOS  apps  reached  500,000   not  counting  many  more  that  Apple  rejected ,  and the total number of downloads was already 25 billion.1   At the same time, some of the same developments strengthened  a different vision of media computing—a computer as a device for  buying  and  consuming  professional  media,  organizing  personal  media  assets  and  using  GUI  applications  for  media  creation  and  editing—but not imagining and creating “not-yet-invented media.”  Apple’s  first  Mac  computer,  released  in  1984,  did  not  support  writing  new  programs  to  take  advantage  of  its  media  capacities.  The adoption of the GUI interface for all PC applications by the  software industry made computers much easier to use but in the  same time took away any reason to learn programming. Around  2000, Apple’s new paradigm of a computer as a “media hub”  or  a “media center” —a platform for managing all personally created     1 http:  www.apple.com itunes 25-billion-app-countdown   March 5, 2012 .      UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    109  media—further  erased  the  “computer”  part  of  a  PC.  During  the  following decade, the gradual emergence of web-based distribution  channels for commercial media, such as Apple iTunes Music Store   2003 , internet television  in the US the first successful service was  Hulu, publically launched on March 12, 2008 , the e-book market   Random  House  and  HarperCollins  started  selling  their  titles  in  digital  form  in  2002   and  finally  the  Apple  iBookstore   April  3,  2010 ,  together  with  specialized  media  readers  and  players  such  as  Amazon’s  Kindle   November  2007   have  added  a  new  crucial  part to this paradigm.  In the early 2010s we also got the Android  app market, the Amazon app store, etc.  A computer became even  more of a “universal media machine” than before—with the focus  on consuming media created by others.    Thus, if in 1984 Apple’s first Apple computer was critiqued for  its GUI applications and lack of programming tools for the users,  in 2010 Apple’s iPad was critiqued for not including enough GUI  tools  for  heavy  duty  media  creation  and  editing—another  step  back from Kay’s Dynabook vision. The following quote from an  iPad  review  by  Walter  S.  Mossberg  from  the  Wall  Street  Journal  was typical of journalists’ reactions to the new device: “if you’re  mainly a Web surfer, note-taker, social-networker and emailer, and  a consumer of photos, videos, books, periodicals and music—this  could  be  for  you.”2  The  New  York  Times’  NYT’s  David  Pogue  echoed this: “The iPad is not a laptop. It’s not nearly as good for  creating  stuff.  On  the  other  hand,  it’s  infinitely  more  convenient  for  consuming  it—books,  music,  video,  photos,  Web,  e-mail  and  so on.”3   Regardless  of  how  much  contemporary  “universal  media  machines”  fulfill  or  betray  Alan  Kay’s  original  vision,  they  are  only  possible  because  of  it.  Kay  and  others  working  at  Xerox  PARC built the first such machine by creating a number of media  authoring  and  editing  applications  with  a  unified  interface,  as  well as the technology to enable the machine’s users to extend its  capacities. Starting with the concept Kay and Goldberg proposed  in  1977,  to  sum  up  this  work  at  PARC   the  computer  as  “a  metamedium” whose content is “a wide range of already-existing  and not-yet-invented media”  in this chapter I will discuss how this     2  http:  ptech.allthingsd.com 20100331 apple-ipad-review    April  3,  2010 .   3 http:  gizmodo.com 5506824 first-ipad-reviews-are-in  April 3, 2010 .   110   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  concept redefines what media is. In other words, I will go deeper  into  the  key  question  of  this  book:  what  exactly  is  media  after  software?    Approached  from  the  point  of  view  of  media  history,  the  computer  metamedium  contains  two  different  types  of  media.  The  first  type  is  simulations  of  prior  physical  media  extended  with new properties, such as “electronic paper.” The second type  is  a  number  of  new  computational  media  that  have  no  physical  precedents. Here are the examples of these “new media proper,”  listed with names of the people and or places usually credited as  their inventors: hypertext and hypermedia  Ted Nelson ; interactive  navigable  3D  spaces   Ivan  Sutherland ,  interactive  multimedia   Architecture Machine Group’s “Aspen Movie Map” .   This taxonomy is consistent with the definition of the computer  metamedium given in the end of Kay and Goldberg’s article. But  let  us  now  ask  a  new  question:  what  are  the  building  blocks  of  these simulations of previously existing media and newly invented  media? Actually we have already encountered these blocks in the  preceding  discussion  but  until  now  I  have  not  explicitly  pointed  them out.    The building blocks used to make up the computer metamedium  are different types of media data and the techniques for generating,  modifying, and viewing this data. Currently, the most widely used  data  types  are  text,  vector  images  and  image  sequences   vector  animation , continuous tone images and sequences of such images   i.e., photographs and digital video , 3D models, geo-spatial data,  and audio. I am sure that some readers would prefer a somewhat  different list and I will not argue with them. What is important at  this point for our discussion is to establish that we have multiple  kinds of data rather than just one kind.    This  points  leads  us  to  the  next  one:  the  techniques  for  data  manipulation themselves can be divided into two types depending  on which data types they can work on:    A  The first type is media creation, manipulation, and access   techniques that are specific to particular types of data.  In other words, these techniques can be used only on  a particular data type  or a particular kind of “media  content” . I am going to refer to these techniques as media- specific  the word “media” in this case really stands for       UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    111     “data type” . For example, the technique of geometrical  constraint satisfaction invented by Sutherland can work  on graphical data defined by points and lines. However,  it would be meaningless to apply this technique to text.  Another example: today image editing programs usually  include various filters such as “blur” and “sharpen” which  can operate on continuous tone images. But normally  we would not be able to blur or sharpen a 3D model.  Similarly, it would be as meaningless to try to “extrude” a  text or “interpolate” it as to define a number of columns  for an image or a sound composition.     Some of these data manipulation techniques appear  to have no historical precedents in physical media—the  technique of geometric constraint satisfaction is a case  in point. Another example of such new technique is  evolutionary algorithms commonly used to generate still  images, animations, and 3D forms. Other media-specific  techniques do refer to prior physical tools or machines—for  instance, brushes in image editing applications, a zoom  command in graphics software, or a trim command in  video editing software. In other words, the same division  between simulations and “properly new” media also  applies to the individual techniques that make up the  “computer metamedium.”    B  The second type is new software techniques that can   work with digital data in general  i.e. they are not media- specific . The examples are “view control,” hyperlinking,  sort, search, network protocols such as HTTP, and various  data analysis techniques from the fields of Artificial  Intelligence, Machine Leaning, Knowledge Discovery, and  other sub-fields of computer science.  In fact, large parts  of computer science, information science and computer  engineering science are about these techniques—since they  focus on designing algorithms for processing information in  general.  These techniques are general ways of manipulating  data regardless of what this data encodes  i.e. pixel values,  text characters, sounds, etc. . I will be referring to these  techniques as media-independent. For instance, as we  saw, Engelbart’s “view control”—the idea that the same    112   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  information can be displayed in many different ways—is  now implemented in most media editors and therefore  works with images, 3D models, video files, animation  projects, graphic designs, and sound compositions. “View  control” has also become part of the modern OS  operating  systems such as Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, or Google  Chrome OS . We use view control daily when we change  the files “view” between “icons,” “list,” and “columns”   these are names used in Mac OS X; other OS may use  different names to refer to the same views . General media- independent techniques also include interface commands  such as cut, copy, and paste. For instance, you can select a  file name in a directory, a group of pixels in an image, or  a set of polygons in a 3D model, and then cut, copy, and  paste these selected objects.   OK:  we  now  have  two  different  ways  of  “dividing  up”  the  computer metamedium. If we want to continue using the concept  of  a  “medium,”  we  will  say  that  a  computer  simulates  prior  mediums and allows for the definition of new ones. Alternatively,  we can think of the computer metamedium as a collection of data  types, media-specific techniques that can only operate on particular  types,  and  media-independent  techniques  that  can  work  on  any  data. Each of the mediums contained in the computer metamedium  is  made  from  some  of  these  building  blocks.  For  example,  the  elements of the “navigable 3D space” medium are 3D models plus  techniques for representing them in perspective, texture mapping,  simulating effects of various types of lights on their surface, casting  shadows, and so on. In another example, the elements of “digital  photography” are continuous tone images captured by lens-based  sensors plus a variety of techniques for manipulating these images:  changing contrast and saturation, scaling, compositing, etc.    A note about the distinction between media-specific and media- independent techniques: it works in theory. In practice, however,  it is often hard to say in what category a particular technique or  a medium should be placed. For instance, is Sketchpad’s ability  to work at any of 2000 levels of magnification an extension of  techniques which existed previously  moving one’s body closer  to the drawing board, using a magnifying lens  or is it something  really  new?  Or  what  about  3D  navigable  space,  which  I  have       UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    113  used  as  an  example  of  a  new  medium  only  made  possible  by  computers  tracing it to Sutherland’s first Virtual Reality system  of 1966 ? Is it new—or is it an extension of a physical medium  of architecture, which allows a human being to walk around the  built structures?    The boundaries between “simulated media” and “new media,”  or between “media-specific” and “media-independent” techniques  should not be thought of as solid walls. Rather than thinking of  them as rigidly defined categories, let us imagine them as coordi- nates  of  the  map  of  the  computer  metamedium.  Like  any  first  sketch, no matter how imprecise, this map is useful because now  we have something to modify as we go forward.   Media-independent vs.  media-specific techniques  Having drawn our first map of the computer metamedium, let us  now examine it to see if it can reveal something which we did not  notice so far. We see a number of mediums, old and new—and this  certainly  fits  with  our  common  understanding  of  media  history.   For example, take a look at the table of contents of McLuhan’s  Understanding Media and you will find two dozen chapters each  devoted to a particular medium—which for McLuhan range from  writing  and  roads  to  cars  and  TV.   We  also  see  various  media- specific  techniques  and  this  again  is  something  we  are  familiar  with: think of editing techniques in cinema, defining a contour in  painting, creating rhyme in poetry, or shaping a narrative out of  chronological  story  events  in  literature.  But  one  area  of  the  map  does looks new and different in relation to previous cultural history.  This  is  the  area  that  contains  “media-independent  techniques.”  What are these techniques, and how can they work across media,  i.e. on different types of data?  “Design across media” was a phrase  used by Adobe in marketing an early version of its Creative Suite  of media authoring applications.    I  am  going  to  argue  that  “media  independence”  does  not  just  happen by itself. For a technique to work with various data types,  programmers have to implement a different method for each data  type.  Thus,  media-independent  techniques  are  general  concepts    114   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  translated  into  algorithms,  which  can  operate  on  particular  data  types. Let us look at some examples.   Consider the omnipresent cut and paste. The algorithm to select  a word in a text document is different from the algorithm to select  a curve in a vector drawing, or the algorithm to select a part of a  continuous tone  i.e. raster  image. In other words, “cut and paste”  is  a  general  concept  that  is  implemented  differently  in  different  media  software  depending  on  which  data  type  this  software  is  designed  to  handle.   In  Larry  Tesler’s  original  implementation  of  the universal commands concept done at PARC in 1974–5, it only  worked for text editing.  Although cut, copy, paste, and a number  of similar “universal commands” are available in all contemporary  GUI  applications  for  desktop  computers   but  not  necessarily  in  mobile phone apps , what they actually do and how they do it is  different from application to application.    Search operates in the same way. The algorithm to search for a  particular phrase in a text document is different than the algorithm  that searches for a particular face in a photo or a video clip.  I am  talking here about “content-based search,” i.e. the type of search  which  looks  for  information  inside  actual  images,  as  opposed  to  only  searching  image  titles  and  other  metadata  the  way  image  search engines such as Google Image Search were doing it in the  2000s.   However,  despite  these  differences  the  general  concept  of  search  is  the  same:  locating  any  elements  of  a  single  media  object—or any media objects in a larger set—to match particular  user-defined criteria. Thus we can ask the web browser to locate  all instances of a particular word in a current web page; we can  ask a web search engine to locate all web pages which contain a set  of keywords; and we can ask a content-based image search engine  to find all images that are similar in composition to an image we  provided.   Because of the popularity of the search paradigm on the web,  we now assume that in principle we can—or will be able to in the  future—search any media. In reality it is much easier to search data  that has a modular organization—such as text or 3D models—than  media that does not have it, such as continuous-tone images, video,  or audio. But for the users these differences are not important—as  far as they are concerned, all types of media content acquire a new  common property that can be called searchability.    Similarly,  in  the  mid-2000s  photo  and  video  media  started       UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    115  to  acquire  another  property  of  findability.   I  am  borrowing  this  term  from  2005  book  by  Peter  Morville,  Ambient  Findability:  What  We  Find  Changes  Who  We  Become4 .  The  appearance  of  consumer GPS-enabled media capture devices and the addition of  geo-tagging,  geo-search,  and  mapping  services  to  media  sharing  sites such as Flickr  added in 2006  and media management appli- cations  such  as  iPhoto   added  in  2009   gradually  made  media  “location aware.”    Another example of a general concept that, through the efforts  by many people, was gradually made to work with different media  types—and  thus  became  a  “media-independent  technique”— is  information  visualization   often  abbreviated  as  infovis.   The  name  “infovis”  already  suggests  that  it  is  not  a  media-specific  technique—rather it is a very general method that potentially can  be applied to any data. The name implies that we can potentially  take  anything—numbers,  text,  network,  sound,  video,  etc.—and  map it into image to reveal patterns and relationships in the data.   A parallel to information visualization is data sonification, which  renders data as sound .    However,  it  took  decades  to  invent  techniques  to  turn  this  potential into reality. In the 1980s the emerging field of scientific  visualization  focused  on  3D  visualization  of  numerical  data.  In  the second part of the 1990s the growing graphics capabilities of  PCs  made  possible  for  larger  numbers  of  people  to  experiment  with visualization—which led to the development of techniques to  visualize media. The first successful visualizations of large bodies of  text appeared around 1998  Rethinking the Book by David Small,  1998; Valence by Ben Fry, 1999; TextArc by W. Bradford Paley,  20025 ; visualizations of musical structures in 2001  The Shape of  Song by Martin Wattenberg ; and visualization of a feature film in  2000  The Top Grossing Film of All Time, 1 x 1 by Jason Salovan .   Information  visualization  is  a  particularly  interesting  example  of  a  new  “media-independent  technique”  because  of  the  variety  of  the  algorithms  and  strategies  for  representing  data  visually.     4 Peter Morville.

Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg, 2012.      UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    117   118   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  For example, Martin Wattenberg whose work, in his own words,  “focuses  on  visual  explorations  of  culturally  significant  data,”6  created visualizations of a history of net art, the music compositions  of Bach, Philip Glass and other composers, the thought process of  a  computer  chess-playing  program,  and  the  history  of  Wikipedia  pages, among other projects. In each case he had to decide which  dimensions  of  the  data  to  choose  and  how  to  translate  them  in  a  visual  form.  But  despite  the  differences,  we  recognize  all  these  projects as information visualizations. They are all realizations of  the same general concept—selecting some dimensions of the data  and  representing  them  visually  through  the  relations  of  graphic  elements.7  They  also  all  rely  on  the  same  fundamental  capacities  of software to manipulate numerical data and to map it from one  form  to  another.  Finally,  they  all  can  be  also  understood  as  the  application  of  the  new  computer  media  of  computer  graphics— generation  of  images  from  numerical  data.   Think  of  an  affinity  between a 3D computer model based on a 3D scan of a face, and  a vector visualization of, for instance, the face’s position over time,  based on the data extracted from a video.     As the result of infovis work by Wattenberg and other people  over the course of last two decades many types of data acquired  a  new  common  property—their  structure  can  be  visualized.  This  new property of media is distributed across various applications,  software  libraries,  art  and  design  projects,  research  papers,  and  prototypes. Today some visualization tools are included in media  editing  software—for  instance,  media  editors  such  as  Photoshop  can display a histogram of an image, Final Cut and other profes- sional video editing software can visualize the color content of a  video clip, and many media players including iTunes offer a music  visualization  feature.  Google  Trends  visualizes  search  patterns;  YouTube and Flickr visualize viewing stats for video and photos.  Going  through  the  thousands  of  infovis  projects  collected  on  infosthetics.com,  visualcomplexity.com,  and  other  blogs  about  visualizations, we find a variety of experiments in visualization of  media  such  as  songs,  poems  and  novels  and  every  possible  kind     6 http:  www.bewitched.com about.html  July 23, 2006 .   7 For  a  detailed  discussion  of  infovis,  most  general  principles  and  new  develop- ments,  see  my  article  “What  is  Visualization?”   2010 ,  Visual  Studies  26,  no.  1   March 2011 .

Visualization,  searchability,  findability—these  and  many  other  new  “media-independent  techniques”   i.e.  concepts  implemented  to work across many data types  clearly stand out in the map of  the computer metamedium we have drawn because they go against  our habitual understanding of media as plural  i.e. as consisting of  a number of separate mediums . If we can use the same techniques  across  different  media  types,  what  happens  to  these  distinctions  between mediums?   The idea that all artworks fall into a number of distinct mediums  each with its own distinct techniques and representational devices  was central to modern art and aesthetics. In his 1766 Laokoon oder  Über die Grenzen der Malerei und Poesie  Laocoon: An Essay on  the Limits of Painting and Poetry  German philosopher Gotthold  Ephraim Lessing argued for the radical difference between poetry  and  painting  since  one  is  “extended”  in  time  and  the  other  is  in  space.  The  idea  reached  its  extreme  in  the  first  two  decades  of  the twentieth century when modernist artists focused their energy  on  discovering  a  unique  language  of  each  artistic  medium.  The  following statement made in 1924 by Jean Epstein, a French avant- garde filmmaker and theoretician, is typical of modernist rhetoric  of  purity;  countless  statements  like  it  appeared  on  the  pages  of  avant-garde publications of the time:  For every art builds its forbidden city, its own exclusive domain,  autonomous,  specific  and  hostile  to  anything  that  does  not  belong. Astonishing to relate, literature must first and foremost  be  literary;  the  theater,  theatrical;  painting,  pictorial;  and  the  cinema, cinematic. Painting today is freeing itself from many of     8 http:  well-formed.eigenfactor.org ; http:  www.flickr.com photos the_bumblebee   2229041742 in pool-datavisualization   9 http:  www.moma.org interactives exhibitions 2008 elasticmind  10 http:  www.siggraph.org s2009 galleries_experiences information_aesthetics    120   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  its representational and narrative concerns… The cinema must  seek to become, gradually and in the end uniquely, cinematic; to  employ, in other words, only photogenic elements.11  In  relation  to  painting,  the  doctrine  of  media  purity  reaches  its  extreme expression in the famous argument of Clement Greenberg  that “Because flatness was the only condition painting shared with  no  other  art,  Modernist  painting  oriented  itself  to  flatness  as  it  did to nothing else.”12  Note that Greenberg did not advocate this  position as a justification for the abstract art of his contemporaries;  he only offered this as a historical analysis of earlier modernism.    Greenberg wrote: “It was the stressing of the ineluctable flatness  of  the  surface  that  remained,  however,  more  fundamental  than  anything else to the processes by which pictorial art criticized and  defined itself under Modernism. For flatness alone was unique and  exclusive to pictorial art.”   Only after the 1960s when installation—a new art form based  on  the  idea  of  mixing  different  media  and  materials—gradually  became popular and accepted in the art world, did the obsession  with media-specificity lose its importance.    However,  even  during  its  dominance  the  principle  of  media- specificity was always counterbalanced by its opposite. Throughout  the modern period we also find “local”—i.e. specific to particular  historical  moments  and  artistic  schools—attempts  to  formulate  aesthetic  principles  that  can  relate  different  mediums  to  each  other. Consider for instance the considerable efforts spent by many  modernist artists to establish parallels between musical and visual  compositions.  This  work  was  often  associated  with  the  ideas  of  synesthesia  and  Gesamtkunstwerk;  it  included  theories,  practical  compositions,  and  technologies  such  as  color  organs  constructed  by Scriabin, the Whitneys  who went on to create the first computer  animations  and many other artists and musicians.    While  they  did  not  explicitly  theorize  cross-media  aesthetics  to  the  same  degree,  modernist  artistic  paradigms—classicism,   11 Jean Epstein, “On Certain Characteristics of Photogénie,” in French Film Theory  and Criticism, vol. 1: 1907–29, ed. Richard Abel  Princeton: University of Princeton  Press, 1988 . 12 Clement  Greenberg,  “Modern  Painting,”  Forum  Lectures   Washington,  DC:  Voice of America: 1960 , http:  www.sharecom.ca greenberg modernism.html      UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    121  romanticism,  naturalism,  impressionism,  socialist  realism,  supre- matism, cubism, surrealism, and so on—can be also understood as  the systems which gave “common properties” to works in various  media.  Thus,  the  novels  of  Émile  Zola  and  paintings  by  Manet  were  aligned  in  their  uncompromising,  “naturalist”  depiction  of  ordinary  people;  Constructivist  paintings,  graphics,  indus- trial  design,  theatre  design,  architecture  and  fashion  shared  the  aesthetics  of  “expressed  structure”   visually  emphasizing  compo- sition  structure  by  exaggerating  it ;  and  De  Stijl  aesthetics  of  non-intersecting rectangular forms in primary colors were applied  to painting, furniture, architecture, and typography.   What  is  the  difference  between  such  earlier  artistic  work  on  establishing  media  correspondences  and  the  software  techniques  that work across different media? Clearly, the artistic systems and  media  authoring,  editing  and  interaction  techniques  available  in  media software operate on different levels. The former are respon- sible for the content and style of the works to be generated—i.e.  what is going to be created in the first place. The latter are used not  only to create but also to interact with what already was generated  previously—for  instance,  blogs,  photos,  or  videos  on  the  web  created by others.    Put differently, the efforts by modern artists to create parallels  between  mediums  were  prescriptive  and  speculative.13  “Common  media properties” would only apply to selected bodies of artistic  work created by particular artists or groups. In contrast, software  imposes  common  media  “properties”  on  any  media  it  is  applied  to. Thus, software also shapes our understanding of what media  is in general. For example, web applications and services include  methods  for  navigating,  reading,  listening  or  viewing  media  objects, attaching additional information to them  comments, tags,  geo-tagging  or finding them in a larger set  i.e. search engines and  search commands . This applies to all videos, images, text pages,  text documents, maps, etc. In other words, we can say that media   13 By  speculative  here  I  mean  that  in  many  cases  the  proposed  aesthetic  systems  were not fully realized in practice. For example, no purely suprematist architecture  designed by movement leader Kasimir Malevich was ever built; the same goes for  the futurist architecture of Antonio Sant’Elia as presented in his drawings for La  Città Nuova, 1912–14.   122   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  software  “interprets”  any  media  it  touches  and  its  “interpreta- tions” always include certain statements.    Of course, “media-independent” aesthetic systems proposed by  modernists were not only generative  the creation of new works   but also interpretive. That is, modernist artists and theorists often  tried to change audiences’ understanding of past and contemporary  art,  usually  in  a  critical  and  negative  way   each  new  movement  wanted  to  discredit  its  predecessors  and  competitors .  However,  since their programs were theories rather than software, they had  no  direct  material  effect  on  users’  interaction  with  the  artistic  works,  including  those  created  in  the  past.  In  contrast,  software  techniques  affect  our  understanding  of  media  through  the  opera- tions  they  make  available  to  us  for  creating,  editing,  interacting  with, and sharing media artifacts.    Additionally, modern artistic and aesthetic paradigms in practice  would only be realized in two, three, or maybe four mediums—but  not all. Naturalism can be found in literature and visual arts but  not in architecture, and Constructivism did not spread to music or  literature. However cut, copy, paste and find commands are found  in  all  media  applications;  any  media  object  can  be  geo-tagged;  the view control principle is implemented to work with all media  types. To cite more examples, recall my discussion of how all media  acquire new properties such as searchability and findability. Any  text  can  be  searched  regardless  of  whether  it  is  something  you  wrote  or  a  classical  novel  downloaded  from  Project  Gutenberg;  similarly,  part  of  an  image  can  be  cut  and  pasted  into  another  image regardless of what these images are. In short: media software  affects  all  media  content  equally,  regardless  of  its  aesthetics,  semantics, authorship, and historical origin.   To  summarize  this  discussion:  in  contrast  to  modern  artistic  programs to create different media that share the same principles,  software media-independent techniques are ubiquitous and “univer- salist.” For instance, cut and paste are built into all media editing  software—from specialized professional applications to consumer  software included on every new media device sold. Further, these  techniques  can  be  applied  to  any  media  work  regardless  of  its  aesthetics and authorship—i.e. whether it was made by the person  who  is  currently  applying  these  operations  or  by  somebody  else.  In fact, the technical ability to sample media work by others has  become the basis of the key aesthetics of our time—remixing.      UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    123    Of  course,  not  all  media  applications  and  devices  make  all  these  techniques  equally  available—usually  for  commercial  and  or  copyright  reasons.  For  example,  at  present  the  Google  Books  reader does not allow you to select and copy the text from book  pages. Thus, while our analysis applies to conceptual and technical  principles of software and their cultural implications, we need to  keep  in  mind  that  in  practice  these  principles  are  overwritten  by  commercial structures. However, even the most restrictive software  still  includes  some  basic  media  operations.  By  being  present  in  all  software  designed  to  work  with  different  media  types,  these  operations  establish  a  shared  understanding  of  media  today— experienced  by  the  users  as  “common  media  principles”  of  all  content.   To  conclude  this  discussion  of  software  techniques  that  work  across  different  media  types,  recall  my  earlier  statement  that  computerization of media does not collapse the difference between  mediums—but it does bring them closer together in various ways.   I  have  already  provided  a  number  of  examples  of  this  in  the  beginning of my analysis of Kay and Goldberg’s Personal Dynamic  Media article . Now I can name one of the key developments respon- sible  for  this  “media  attraction”—common  software  techniques  which can operate across different media types. If we recall again  Kay  and  Goldberg’s  formulation  that  the  computer  metamedium  includes a variety of already-existing and new media, this statement  can be paraphrased as follows: within the computer metamedium,  all  previously  existing  and  newly  invented  mediums  share  some  common  properties—i.e.  they  rely  on  a  set  of  common  software  techniques for data management, authoring, and communication.   It  is  hard  to  over-estimate  the  historical  importance  of  the  development  of  these  cross-media  techniques.  Humans  have  always  used  some  general  strategies  to  organize  their  cultural  representations,  experiences  and  actions—for  example,  narrative,  symmetry,  rhythm,  the  repetitive  structures   think  of  ornament ,  use of complementary colors, and a few others. Clearly these strat- egies  were  very  important  for  human  perception,  cognition,  and  memory—and that is why we find them in every culture and every  medium, from poetry to architecture, music and poetry. However,  these  strategies  were  normally  not  embedded  into  any  techno- logical  tools  or  materials—they  were  in  the  minds  and  bodies  of  artisans  who  were  communicating  them  from  generation  to    124   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  generation. Modern media for representation and communication  bring us to a new stage. They often do embody certain techniques  that apply to any media which can be generated or captured with  them   for  instance,  one-point  linear  perspective  imposed  by  lens- based capture technologies such as photography, film and analog  and  digital  video .  However  these  techniques  would  apply  only  to  particular  media  types.  Against  these  historical  developments,  the  innovation  of  media  software  clearly  stands.  They  bring  a  new  set  of  techniques  which  are  implemented  to  work  across  all  media. Searchability, findability, linkability, multimedia messaging  and  sharing,  editing,  view  control,  zoom  and  other  “media- independent” techniques are viruses that infect everything software  touches—and therefore in their importance they can be compared  to  the  basic  organizing  principles  for  media  and  artifacts  which  were used for thousands of years.  Inside Photoshop  Contemporary  media  is  experienced,  created,  edited,  remixed,  organized, and shared with software. This software includes stand- alone  professional  media  design  and  management  applications  such  as  Photoshop,  Illustrator,  Dreamweaver,  Final  Cut,  After  Effects, Aperture, and Maya; consumer-level apps such as iPhoto,  iMovie,  or  Picasa;  tools  for  sharing,  commenting,  and  editing  provided by social media sites such as Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo,  and Photobucket, and the numerous media viewing, editing, and  sharing apps available on mobile platforms. To understand media  today  we  need  to  understand  media  software—its  genealogy   where  it  comes  from ,  its  anatomy   interfaces  and  operations ,  and its practical and theoretical effects. How does media authoring  software  shape  the  media  being  created,  making  some  design  choices  seem  natural  and  easy  to  execute,  while  hiding  other  design possibilities? How does media viewing managing remixing  software affect our experience of media and the actions we perform  on it? How does software change what “media” is conceptually?    This  section  continues  investigating  these  general  questions  that drive this book via the analysis of a software application that  became  synonymous  with  “digital  media”—Adobe  Photoshop.       UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    125  Like other professional programs for media authoring and editing,  Photoshop’s menus contain many dozens of separate commands. If  we consider that almost all the commands contain multiple options  that allow each command to do a number of different things, the  complete number runs into the thousands.    This  multiplicity  of  operations  offered  in  contemporary  appli- cation software creates a challenge for Software Studies. If we are  to  understand  how  software  applications  participate  in  shaping  our  worlds  and  our  imaginations   what  people  imagine  they  can  do with software , we need some way of sorting all these opera- tions  into  fewer  categories  so  we  can  start  building  a  theory  of  application software. This cannot be achieved by simply following  the  top  menu  categories  offered  by  applications.   For  example,  Photoshop CS4’s top menu includes File, Edit, Layer, Select, Filter,  3D,  View,  Window,  and  Help.   Since  most  applications  include  their own unique categories, our combined list will be too large. So  we need to use a more general system.   The  provisional  map  of  the  computer  metamedium  that  we  developed in previous sections provides one such possible system.  In this section we will test the usefulness of this map by analyzing a  subset of Photoshop’s commands which, in a certain sense, stand-in  for this application in our cultural imagination: Filters. We will also  discuss another key feature of Photoshop—Layers.    Our map organizes software techniques for working with media,  using two schemes. The first scheme divides these techniques into  two  types  depending  on  which  data  types  they  can  work  on:  1   media  creation,  manipulation,  and  access  techniques  that  are  specific to particular types of data; 2  new software techniques that  can work with digital data in general  i.e. they are not specific to  particular types of data . My second scheme also divides software  techniques  for  working  with  media  data  into  two  types,  but  it  does  this  in  a  different  way.  What  matters  here  are  the  relations  between  software  techniques  and  pre-digital  media  technologies.  In  this  taxonomy,  some  techniques  are  simulations  of  pre-digital  media  techniques  augmented  with  new  properties  and  functions;  other techniques do not have any obvious equivalents in previous  physical or electronic media.   While for a media historian the second scheme is quite meaningful,  what about users who are “digital natives”? These software users  may  never  have  directly  used  any  other  media  besides  tablets  or    126   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Photoshop Toolbox from version 0.63  1988  to 7.0  2002 .      UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    127   128   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  laptops, or mobile media devices  mobile phones, cameras, music  players ; and they are also likely to be unfamiliar with the details  of  twentieth-century  cel  animation,  film  editing  equipment,  or  any  other  pre-digital  media  technology.  Does  this  mean  that  the  distinction  between  software  simulations  of  previously  existing  media  tools  and  new  “born  digital”  media  techniques  has  no  meaning for digital natives but only matters for historians of media  such as myself?    I  think  that  while  the  semantics  of  this  distinction   i.e.  the  reference  to  previous  technologies  and  practices   may  not  be  meaningful  to  digital  natives,  the  distinction  itself  is  something  these  users  experience  in  practice.  To  understand  why  this  is  the  case,  let  us  ask  if  all  “born  digital”  media  techniques  available  in media authoring software applications may have something in  common—besides the fact that they did not exist before software.   One  of  the  key  uses  of  digital  computers  from  the  start  was  automation. As long as a process can be defined as a finite set of  simple steps  i.e. as an algorithm , a computer can be programmed  to  execute  these  steps  without  human  input.  In  the  case  of  application  software,  the  execution  of  any  command  involves  “low-level” automation  since a computer automatically executes a  sequence of steps of the algorithm behind the command . However,  what  it  is  important  from  the  user’s  point  of  view  is  the  level  of  automation being offered in the command’s interface.   Many  software  techniques  that  simulate  physical  tools  share  a  fundamental  property  with  these  tools:  they  require  a  user  to  control them “manually.” The user has to micro-manage the tool,  so to speak, directing it step-by-step to produce the desired effect.  For instance, you have to explicitly move the cursor in a desired  pattern to produce a particular brushstroke using a brush tool; you  also have to explicitly type every letter on a keyboard to produce  a  desired  sentence.  In  contrast,  many  of  the  techniques  that  do  not simulate anything that existed previously—at least, not in any  obvious way—offer higher-level automation of creative processes.  Rather  than  controlling  every  detail,  a  user  specifies  parameters  and controls and sets the tool in motion. All generative  also called  “procedural”  techniques available in media software fall into this  category. For example, rather than having to create a rectangular  grid  made  of  thousands  of  lines  by  hand,  a  user  can  specify  the  width and the height of the grid and the size of one cell, and the       UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    129  program will generate the desired result. Another example of this  higher-level  automation  is  interpolation  of  key  values  offered  by  animation software. In a twentieth-century animation production,  a  key  animator  drew  key  frames  which  were  then  forwarded  to  human  in-betweeners  who  created  all  the  frames  in  between  the  key frames. Animation software automates the process of creating  in-between  drawings  by  automatically  interpolating  the  values  between the key frames.   Thus, although users may not care that one software tool does  something  that  was  not  possible  before  digital  computers  while  another  tool  simulates  previous  physical  or  electronic  media,  the  distinction  itself  between  the  two  types  is  something  users  experience  in  practice.  The  tools  that  belong  to  the  first  type  showcase the ability of computers to automate processes; the tools  that belong to the second type use invisible low-level automation  behind the scenes while requiring users to direct them manually.   Filter > stylize > wind  Having established two sets of categories for software techniques   media-independent  vs.  media-specific;  simulation  of  the  old  vs.  new ,  let  us  now  test  them  against  the  Photoshop  commands.  Before  starting,  however,  it  is  important  to  note  once  again  that  the  two  proposed  schemes  are  intended  to  serve  only  as  provi- sional categories. They provide one possible set of directions—an  equivalent of North, South, West and East for a map where we can  locate multiple operations of media design software. Like any first  sketch, no matter how imprecise, this map is useful because now  we have something to modify as we go forward. Our goal is not to  try to fit everything we will look at into the categories of this initial  map, but rather to discover its limitations as quickly as we can, and  make modifications.    We will start with Photoshop filters—i.e. the set of commands  that appear under the Filter menu.  Note that a large proportion  of  Photoshop  filters  are  not  unique  to  this  program  but  are  also  available  in  other  professional  image  editing,  video  editing  and  animation  software—sometimes  under  different  names.  To  avoid  any possible misunderstanding, I will be referring to the Photoshop  versions  of  these  commands  as  implemented  in  Photoshop  CS4,    130   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  with  their  particular  options  and  controls  as  defined  in  this  software release.14     The first thing that is easy to notice is that the names of many  Photoshop  filters  refer  to  the  techniques  for  image  manipulation  and  creation  and  materials  that  were  available  before  the  devel- opment  of  media  application  software  in  the  1990s—painting,  drawing  and  sketching,  photography,  glass,  neon,  photocopying.  Each filter is given a set of explicit options that can be controlled  with interactive sliders and or by directly entering desired numbers.  These  controls  not  only  offer  many  options  but  also  often  allow  you to set filter’s properties numerically by choosing a precise value  from a range.    This  is  a  good  example  of  my  earlier  point  that  simulations  of  prior  physical  media  augment  them  with  new  properties.  In  this  case,  the  new  property  is  the  explicit  filter  controls.  For  example, the Palette Knife filter offers three options: Stroke Size,  Stroke  Detail,  and  Softness.  Stroke  Size  can  take  values  between  1  and  50;  the  other  two  options  have  similarly  large  ranges.   At  the  same  time,  it  is  important  to  note  that  expert  users  of  many  physical tools such as a paintbrush can also achieve many effects  not possible in its software simulation. Thus, software simulations  should  not  be  thought  of  simply  as  improvements  over  previous  media technologies.    While  some  of  these  filters  can  be  directly  traced  to  previous  physical  and  mechanical  media  such  as  oil  painting  and  photog- raphy,  others  make  a  reference  to  actions  or  phenomena  in  the  physical  world  that  at  first  appear  to  have  nothing  to  do  with  media. For instance, the Extrude filter generates a 3D set of blocks  or pyramids and paints image parts on their faces, while the Wave  filter creates the effect of ripples on the surface of an image.   However, if we examine any of these filters in detail, we realize  that things are not so simple. Let us take the Wind filter  located  under the Stylize submenu  as an example. This is how Photoshop  CS4’s built-in Help describes this filter: “Places tiny horizontal lines  in the image to create a windblown effect. Methods include Wind;  Blast, for a more dramatic wind effect; and Stagger, which offsets  the lines in the image.” We are all familiar with the visual effects   14 For  a  history  of  Photoshop  version  releases,  see  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki  Adobe_Photoshop_release_history      UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    131  The effects of Photoshop Wind filter  version CS5.1 . Left to right:  original shape, no filter; the filter with “wind” option applied; the filter  with “blast” option applied.  of a strong wind on a physical environment  for instance, blowing  through a tree or a field of grass —but before you encountered this  filter, you probably never imagined that you can “wind” an image.  Shall  we  understand  the  name  of  this  filter  as  a  metaphor?  Or  perhaps, we can think of it as an example of a conceptual “blend”   which  is  how,  according  to  Conceptual  Blending  theory,  many  concepts in natural languages get formed15 : “wind” plus “image”  results in a new concept actualized in the operations of the Wind  filter.    The situation is further complicated by the fact that the results  of  applying  the  Wind  filter  to  an  image  look  pretty  different  compared to what the actual wind does to a tree or a field of grass.  However,  they  do  look  rather  similar  to  a  photograph  of  a  real  windy scene taken with a long exposure. Therefore, we can think  of the name “Wind” both as a metaphor—to help us imagine what  a particular algorithmic transformation does to an image—and as a  simulation of a particular photographic technique  long exposure .  In short, although its name points to the physical world, its actual  operations may also refer to a pre-digital media technology.   Are there “born digital” filters?  Let  us  continue  the  exploration  of  Photoshop  filters.  The  great  majority of the filters make references to previous physical media   15 See  Mark  Turner  and  Gilles  Fauconnier,  The  Way  We  Think.  Conceptual  Blending and the Mind’s Hidden Complexities  New York: Basic Books 2002 .    132   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  or our experiences in the physical world—at least in terms of how  they are named. Only a few do not. These filters include High-pass,  Median,  Reduce  Noise,  Sharpen,  and  Equalize.  Are  these  filters  “born digital”? In other words, did we finally get to pure examples  of “new” media techniques? The answer is no. As it turns out, all  these filters are also software simulations that refer to things that  already existed before digital computers.    Although they represent a small subset of Photoshop’s extensive  filter collection, these filters are central to all electronics, telecom- munication, and IT technologies. Moreover, they are not unique to  processing digital images but can be used on any kind of data— sounds, television transmission, data captured by an environmental  sensor, data captured by a medical imaging devices, etc.    In  their  Photoshop  implementation,  these  filters  work  on  continuous-tone images, but since they can be also applied to sound  and  other  types  of  signals,  they  actually  belong  to  our  “media- independent”  category  of  software  techniques.  In  other  words,  they are general techniques developed first in engineering and later  also  in  computer  science  for  signal  and  information  processing.  The  application  of  these  techniques  to  images  forms  the  part  of  the field of image processing defined as “any form of information  processing for which the input is an image, such as photographs or  frames  of  video.”16  This  conceptual  relationship  between  “infor- mation processing” and “image processing” exemplifies one of the  key points of this book—in software culture, “digital media” is a  particular subset of the larger category “information.”  Thus, the  operations commonly used with media form a subset of the larger  category “data processing.”    Like  these  filters,  many  of  the  “new”  techniques  for  media  creation,  editing,  and  analysis  implemented  in  software  applica- tions  were  not  developed  specifically  to  work  with  media  data.  Rather, they were created for signal and information processing in  general—and then were either directly carried over to, or adapted  to  work  with  media.   Thus,  development  of  software  brings  different media types closer together because the same techniques  can be used on all of them. At the same time, “media” now share   16 Ibid.      UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    133  a  relationship  with  all  other  information  types,  be  they  financial  data, patient records, results of a scientific experiments, etc.    This  is  one  of  the  most  important  theoretical  dimensions  in  the  shift  from  physical  and  mechanical  media  technologies  to  electronic  media  and  then  digital  software.  Previously,  physical  and  mechanical  media  tools  were  used  to  create  content  which  was directly accessible to human senses  with some notable excep- tions like Morse code —and therefore the possibilities of each tool  and material were driven by what was meaningful to a particular  human  sense.  A  paintbrush  could  create  brushstrokes  that  had  color, thickness, and shape—properties directly speaking to human  vision  and  touch.  Similarly,  the  settings  of  photographic  camera  controls affected the sharpness and contrast of captured photos— characteristics  meaningful  to  human  vision.  A  different  way  to  express this is to say that the “message” was not encoded in any  way; it was created, stored, and accessed in its native form. So if  we were to redraw the famous diagram of a communication system  by Claude Shannon  1948 17 for the pre-electronics era, we would  have to delete the encoding and decoding stages.    Successive  media  technologies  based  on  electronics   such  as  the telegraph, telephone, radio, television , and digital computers  employ  the  coding  of  messages  or  “content.”  And  this,  in  turn,  makes  possible  the  idea  of information—a  disembodied,  abstract  and universal dimension of any message separate from its content.  Rather than operating on sounds, images, video, or texts directly,  electronic and digital devices operate on the continuous electronic  signals or discrete numerical data. This allows for the definition of  various operations that work on any signal or any set of numbers— regardless of what this signal or numbers may represent  images,  video,  student  records,  financial  data,  etc. .  Examples  of  such  operations  are  modulation,  smoothing   i.e.,  reducing  the  differ- ences  in  the  data ,  and  sharpening   exaggerating  the  differences .  If the data is discrete, this allows for various additional operations  such as sorting and searching.    The introduction of the coding stage allows for a new level of  efficiency  and  speed  in  processing,  transmitting,  and  interacting  with media data and communication content—and this is why first   17 C.

Operations  such  as  those  just  mentioned are now used to automatically process the signals and  data in various ways—reducing the size of storage or bandwidth  needed,  improving  quality  of  a  signal  to  get  rid  of  noise,  and  of  course—perhaps  most  importantly—to  send  media  data  over  communication networks.    The  field  of  digital  image  processing  began  to  develop  in  the  second half of the 1950s when scientists and the military realized  that digital computers could be used to automatically analyze and  improve  the  quality  of  aerial  and  satellite  imagery  collected  for  military reconnaissance and space research.  Other early applica- tions  included  character  recognition  and  wire-photo  standards  conversion.18  As a part of its development, the field took the basic  filters that were already commonly used in electronics and adapted  them  to  work  with  digital  images.  The  Photoshop  filters  that  automatically enhance image appearance  for instance, by boosting  contrast, or by reducing noise  come directly from that period  late  1950s to early 1960s .   or    “software-native”   filters  have  direct  physical  predecessors  in  analog  filters. These  analog  filters  were  first  implemented  by  the  inventors  of  telephone,  radio,  telephone,  electronic  music  instru- ments, and various other electronic media technologies during the  first half of the twentieth century. They were already widely used  in the electronics industry and studied in the field of analog signal  processing before they were adapted for digital image processing.   In  summary,  Photoshop’s  seemingly  “born  digital”   Filter > distort > wave  The  challenges  in  deciding  in  what  category  to  place  Photoshop  filters  persist  as  we  continue  going  through  the  Filter  menu.  The  two schemes for classifying software techniques for working with   18 Even  though  image  processing  represents  an  active  area  of  computer  science,  and  is  widely  used  in  contemporary  societies,  I  am  not  aware  of  any  books  or  even articles that trace its history. The first book on image processing was Azriel  Rosenfeld, Picture Processing by Computer  New York: Academic Press, 1969 .      UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    135  media I proposed turn out to be exactly what I suggested them to  be—only an initial rough map to start a discussion.   The difficulties in deciding where to place this or that technique  are directly related to the history of digital computers as simulation  machines.  Every  element  of  computational  media  comes  from  some place outside of digital computers. This is true not only for  a  significant  portion  of  media  editing  techniques—filters,  digital  paintbrushes and pencils, CAD tools, virtual musical instruments  and keyboards, etc.—but also for the most basic computer opera- tions such as sort and search, or basic ways to organize data such  as a file or a database. Each of these operations and structures can,  both conceptually and historically, be traced to previous physical  or mechanical operations and to strategies of data, knowledge and  memory management that were already in place before the 1940s.  For example, computer “files” and “folders” refer to their paper  predecessors already standard in every office. The first commercial  digital computers from IBM were marketed as faster equivalents of  electro-mechanical calculators, tabulators, sorters and other office  equipment for data processing that IBM had already been selling  for  decades.  However,  as  we  already  discussed  in  detail  using  as  examples  the  work  of  Ivan  Sutherland,  and  Douglas  Engelbart’s  and  Alan  Kay’s  labs,  whenever  some  physical  operations  and  structures were simulated in a computer, they were simultaneously  enhanced  and  augmented.  This  process  of  transferring  physical  world properties into a computer while augmenting them continues  today—think, for instance of the multi-touch interface popularized  by  Apple’s  iPhone   2007 .  Thus,  while  Alan  Turing  defined  the  digital  computer  as  a  general-purpose  simulation  machine,  when  we  consider  its  subsequent  development  and  use,  it  is  more  appropriate to think of a computer as a simulation-augmentation  machine. The difficulty of deciding how to classify different media  software techniques is a direct result of this paradigm that underlies  the development of what we now call software applications from  the very start  i.e. Sutherland’s Sketchpad, 1962–3 .    The shift from physical media tools and materials as algorithms  designed  to  simulate  the  effects  of  these  tools  and  materials  also  has another important consequence. As we saw, some Photoshop  filters  explicitly  refer  to  previous  artistic  media;  others  make  reference  to  diverse  physical  actions,  effects,  and  objects   Twirl,  Extrude,  Wind,  Diffuse  Glow,  Open  Ripple,  Glass,  Wave,  Grain,    136   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Patchwork,  Pinch,  and  others .  But  in  both  cases,  by  changing  the values of the controls provided by each filter, we can vary its  visual effect significantly on the familiar unfamiliar dimension. We  can use the same filter to achieve a look that may indeed appear  to  closely  simulate  the  effect  of  the  corresponding  physical  tool  or  physical  phenomena—or  a  look  which  is  completely  different  from both nature and older media and which can be only achieved  though algorithmic manipulation of the pixels. What begins as a  reference  to  a  physical  world  outside  of  the  computer  if  we  use  default settings can turn into something totally alien with a change  in the value of a single parameter. In other words, many algorithms  only simulate the effects of physical tools and machines, materials  or physical world phenomena when used with particular parameter  settings; when these settings are changed, they no longer function  as simulations.    For an example, let us analyze the behavior of the Wave filter   located under the Distort submenu . The filter refers to a familiar  physical  phenomena,  and  indeed,  it  can  produce  visual  effects  which we would confidently call “waves.” This does not mean that  the effect of this filter has to closely resemble the literal meaning of  wave defined by a dictionary as “a disturbance on the surface of  a liquid body, as the sea or a lake, in the form of a moving ridge  or  swell.”19  In  our  everyday  language,  we  use  the  word  “wave”  metaphorically  to  refer  to  any  kind  of  periodical  movement   “waving a hand” , or any static form that resembles the form of  a wave, or a disturbance in the ordinary state of affairs  “making  waves.”  According to an influential theory developed by cognitive  linguist George Lakoff, such metaphorical use is not an exception,  but  the  norm  in  human  language  and  thinking.  Lakoff  proposed  that the majority of our abstract concepts are metaphorical projec- tions  from  sensorimotorial  experiences  with  our  own  body  and  the  surrounding  physical  world.20  “Making  waves”  and  other  metaphors  derived  from  our  perceptual  experience  of  seeing  real  waves exemplify this general mechanism of language.    If we follow Lakoff’ s theory of metaphor, some details of the  Wave  filter  operation—along  with  many  other  Photoshop  filters   19 http:  dictionary.reference.com browse wave  August 1, 2012 . 20 George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, Metaphors We Live By  Chicago: University  of Chicago Press, 1980 .

From left to right: the original  shape, no filter; the filter with 1 wave generator; the filter with 10 wave  generators; the filter with 50 wave generators.  that  refer  to  the  physical  world—can  be  understood  as  similar  metaphorical  projections.  Depending  on  the  choice  of  parameter  values,  this  filter  can  either  produce  effects  that  closely  resemble  our perceptual experience of actual physical waves, or new effects  that are related to such waves metaphorically.    The filter generates sine wave functions  y = sin x , adds them  up  and  uses  the  result  to  distort  an  image.  A  user  can  control  the  number  of  sine  waves  via  a  parameter  called  Number  of  Generators. If this number is set to 1, the filter generates a single  sine  wave.  Applying  this  single  function  to  an  image  distorts  it  using  a  periodically  varying  pattern.  In  other  words,  the  filter  indeed generates an effect that looks like a wave.   However,  at  some  point  the  metaphorical  connection  to  real  world  waves  breaks,  and  using  Lakoff’s  theory  no  longer  works.  If we increase the number of generators  it can go up to 999 , the  pattern produced by the filter no longer appears to be periodical,  and  therefore  it  no  longer  can  be  related  to  real  waves  even  metaphorically.    The reason for this filter behavior lies in its implementation. As  we have already explained, when the number of generators is set  to 1, the algorithm generates a single sine function. If the option  is to set to 2, the algorithm generates two functions; if it is set to  3, it generates three functions, and so on. The parameters of each  function are selected randomly within the user specified range.   If  we  keep  the  number  of  generators  small   2–5 ,  sometimes  these random values add up to a result that still resembles a wave;  in  other  cases  they  do  not.  But  when  the  number  of  functions  is  increased, the result of adding these separate functions with unique  random parameters never looks like a wave.   138   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND    Wave filters can create a practically endless variety of abstract  patterns—and most of them are not periodic in an obvious way,  i.e. they are no longer visually recognizable as “waves.” What they  are  is  the  result  of  a  computer  algorithm  that  uses  mathematical  formulas  and  operations   generating  and  adding  sine  functions   to create a vast space of visual possibilities. So although the filter  is called “Wave,” only a tiny part of its space of possible patterns  corresponds to the wave-like visual effects in the real world.    The same considerations apply to many other Photoshop filters  that make references to physical media. Similar to the Wave filter,  the  filters  gathered  under  the  Artistic  and  Texture  submenus  produce  very  precise  simulations  of  the  visual  effects  of  physical  media with a particular range of parameter settings; but when the  parameters are outside of this range, these filters generate a variety  of abstract patterns.    The operation of these Photoshop filters has important theoretical  consequences.  Earlier  I  pointed  out  that  the  software  tools  that  simulate physical instruments—paint brushes, pens, rulers, erasers,  etc.—require  manual  control,  while  the  tools  that  do  not  refer  to  any  previous  media  offer  higher  level  automation.  A  user  sets  the parameter values and the algorithm automatically creates the  desired result.    The  same  high-level  automation  underlies  “generative”   or  “procedural”  software techniques commonly used today. This work  generated by algorithms ranges from live visuals and animations by  software artist Lia21 to the massive procedurally generated world in  the videogame Minecraft. Other generative projects use algorithms  to automatically create complex shapes, animations, spatial forms,  music,  architectural  plans,  etc.   A  good  selection  of  interactive  generative works and generative animations can be found at http:   www.processing.org exhibition  .  Since  most  artworks  created  with generative algorithms are abstract, artists and theorists like to  oppose them to software such as Photoshop and Painter that are  widely  used  by  commercial  illustrators  and  photographers  in  the  service of realism and figuration. Additionally, because these appli- cations  simulate  older  manual  models  of  creation,  they  are  also  seen  as  less  “new  media-specific”  than  generative  software.  The   21 http:  www.liaworks.com category theprojects       UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    139  end result of both of these critiques is that software that simulates  “old  media”  are  thought  to  be  conservative,  while  generative  algorithms and artworks are presented as progressive because these  are  unique  to  “new  media.”   When  people  claim  that  artworks  that involve writing computer code qualify as “digital art” while  artworks created using Photoshop or other media applications do  not, they rehearse a version of the same argument.     However, as they are implemented in media applications such as  Photoshop, the software techniques that simulate previous media  and the software techniques that are explicitly procedural and use  higher-level automation are part of the same continuum. As we saw  with the Wave filter, the same algorithm can generate an abstract  image or a realistic one. Similarly, particle systems algorithms are  used  by  digital  artists  and  motion  graphics  designers  to  generate  abstract animations; the same algorithms are also widely used in  film production to generate realistic-looking explosions, fireworks,  flocks of birds and other physical natural phenomena. In another  example, procedural techniques often used in architectural design  to create abstract spatial structures are also used in video games to  generate realistic 3D environments.  History and actions menus  I started this discussion of Photoshop filters to test the usefulness  of  two  schemes  for  classifying  the  seemingly  endless  variety  of  techniques  available  in  media  software:  1   media-independent  vs.  media-specific  techniques   first  scheme ;  2   the  simulations  of  previous  tools  vs.  techniques  which  do  not  explicitly  simulate  prior media  second scheme . The first scheme draws our attention  to  the  fact  that  all  media  applications  share  some  genes,  so  to  speak,  while  also  providing  some  techniques  that  can  only  work  on particular data types. The second scheme is useful if we want  to understand the software techniques in terms of their genealogy  and their relation to previous physical, mechanical, and electronic  media.    Although  the  previous  discussion  highlighted  the  difficult  borderline cases, in other cases the divisions are clear. For example,  the  Brush  Strokes  filter  family  in  Photoshop  clearly  takes  inspi- ration from earlier physical media tools, while Add Noise does not.    140   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  The Copy and Paste commands are examples of media-independent  techniques;  Auto  Contrast  and  Replace  Color  commands  are  examples of media-specific techniques.    However, beyond these distinctions suggested by the two schemes  I proposed, all software techniques for media creation, editing, and  interaction also share some additional common traits that we have  not  discussed  yet.  Conceptually,  these  traits  are  different  from  common  media-independent  techniques  such  as  copy  and  paste.  What are they?   Regardless of whether they refer to some pre-existing instrument,  action, or phenomena in the physical world or not, media techniques  available  in  application  software  are  implemented  as  computer  programs and functions. Consequently, they follow the principles  of  modern  software  engineering  in  general.  Their  interfaces  use  established  conventions  employed  in  all  application  software— regardless of whether these tools are part of spreadsheet software,  inventory  management  software,  financial  analysis  software,  or  web design software. The techniques are given extensive numerical  controls; their settings can be saved and retrieved later; their use is  recorded in a History window so it can be recalled later; they can  be used automatically by recording and playing Actions; and so on.   The  terms  “History  palette”  and  “Actions”  refer  to  Photoshop,  but  the  concepts  behind  them  are  found  in  many  other  software  applications.   In  other  words,  they  acquire  the  full  function- ality  of  the  modern  software  environment—functionality  that  is  significantly  different  from  that  of  physical  tools  and  machines  that  existed  previously.  Because  of  these  shared  implementation  principles, all software applications are like species that belong to  the  same  evolutionary  family,  with  media  software  occupying  a  branch of the tree.22    The pioneers of media software aimed to extend the properties of  media technologies and tools they were simulating in a computer— in  each  case,  as  formulated  by  Kay  and  Goldberg,  the  goal  was  to  create  “a  new  medium  with  new  properties.”  Consequently,  software  techniques  that  refer  to  previous  physical,  mechanical,  or  electronic  tools  and  creative  processes  are  also  “new  media”   22 Contemporary  biology  no  longer  uses  the  idea  of  an  evolutionary  tree;  the  “species”  concept  has  similarly  proved  to  be  problematic.  Here  I  am  using  these  terms only metaphorically.       UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    141  because  they  behave  so  differently  from  their  predecessors.  We  now  have  an  additional  reason  to  support  this  conclusion.  New  functionality   for  instance,  multiple  zoom  levels ,  the  presence  of  media-independent  techniques   copy,  paste,  search,  etc.   and  standard interface conventions  such as numerical controls for every  tool, preview option, or commands history  further separate even  the most “realistic” media simulation tool from its predecessor.    This  means  that  to  use  any  media  authoring  and  editing  software  is  to  use  “new  media.”  Or,  to  unfold  this  statement:  all  media  techniques  and  tools  available  in  software  applications  are  “new  media”—regardless  of  whether  a  particular  technique  or  program  refers  to  previous  media,  physical  phenomena,  or  a  common task that existed before it was turned into software. To  write using Microsoft Word is to use new media. To take pictures  with a digital camera is to use new media. To apply the Photoshop  Clouds  filter   Filters  >  Render  >  Clouds   that  uses  a  purely  automatic algorithmic process to create a cloud-like texture is to  use new media. To draw brushstrokes using the Photoshop brush  tool is to use new media. In other words, regardless of where a particular technique would    fall in our classification schemes, all these techniques are instances  of one type of technology—interactive application software. And,  as Kay and Goldberg explained in their 1977 article quoted earlier,  interactive  software  is  qualitatively  different  from  all  previous  media.  Over  the  next  thirty  years,  these  differences  became  only  larger. Interactivity; customization; the possibility to both simulate  other media and information technologies and to define new ones;  processing  of  vast  amounts  of  information  in  real-time;  control  and  interaction  with  other  machines  such  as  sensors;  support  of  both  distributed  asynchronous  and  real-time  collaboration— these and many other functionalities enabled by modern software   of  course,  working  together  with  middleware,  hardware,  and  networks   separate  software  from  all  previous  media  and  infor- mation technologies and tools invented by humans.   Layers palette  For  our  final  analysis,  we  will  go  outside  the  Filter  menu  and  examine  one  of  the  key  features  of  Photoshop  that  originally    142   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  differentiated it from many “consumer” media editors—the Layers  palette. The Layers feature was added to Photoshop 3.0, released in  1994.23 To quote Photoshop Help, “Layers allow you to work on  one element of an image without disturbing the others.”24 From the  point of view of media theory, however, the Layers feature is much  more than that. It redefines both how images are created and what  an “image” actually means. What used to be an indivisible whole  becomes a composite of separate parts. This is both a theoretical  point, and the reality of professional design and image editing in  our software society. Any professional design created in Photoshop  is likely to use multiple layers  in Photoshop CS4, a single image  can have thousands of layers . Since each layer can always be made  invisible, layers can also act as containers for elements that poten- tially  may  go  into  the  composition;  they  can  also  hold  different  versions of these elements. A designer can control the transparency  of each layer, group them together, change their order, etc.   Layers  change  how  a  designer  or  an  illustrator  thinks  about  images.  Instead  of  working  on  a  single  design  with  each  change  immediately  and in the case of physical media such as paint or ink,  irreversibly  affecting this image, s he now works with a collection  of separate elements. S he can play with these elements, deleting,  creating, importing and modifying them, until s he is satisfied with  the final composition—or a set of possible compositions that can  be  defined  using  Layer  Groups.  And  since  the  contents  and  the  settings  of  all  layers  are  saved  in  an  image  file,  s he  can  always  come  back  to  this  image  to  generate  new  versions  or  to  use  its  elements in new compositions.    The  layers  can  also  have  other  functions.  To  again  quote  Photoshop  CS4’s  online  Help,  “Sometimes  layers  don’t  contain  any  apparent  content.  For  example,  an  adjustment  layer  holds  color or tonal adjustments that affect the layers below it. Rather  than  edit  image  pixels  directly,  you  can  edit  an  adjustment  layer  and  leave  the  underlying  pixels  unchanged.”25  In  other  words,  the  layers  may  contain  editing  operations  that  can  be  turned  on  and off, and re-arranged in any order. An image is thus redefined  as a provisional composite of both content elements and various   23 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Adobe_Photoshop_release_history 24 http:  help.adobe.com en_US Photoshop 11.0   October 9, 2011 . 25 Ibid.      UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    143  modification operations that are conceptually separate from these  elements.   We  can  compare  this  fundamental  change  in  the  concept  and  practice  of  image  creation  with  a  similar  change  that  took  place  in  mapping—a  shift  from  paper  maps  to  GIS.  Just  as  all  media professionals use Photoshop, today the majority of profes- sional  users  who  deal  with  physical  spaces—city  offices,  utility  companies,  oil  companies,  marketers,  hospital  emergency  teams,  geologists  and  oceanographers,  military  and  security  agencies,  police,  etc.—use  GIS  systems.  Consumer  mapping  software  such  as Google Maps, Microsoft Bing Maps and Google Earth can be  thought  of  as  very  simplified  GIS  systems.  They  do  not  offer  the  features that are crucial for professionals such as spatial analysis.   An example of spatial analysis is directing software to automati- cally determine the best positions for new supermarkets based on  existing demographic, travel, and retail data.     GIS  “captures,  stores,  analyzes,  manages,  and  presents  data  that is linked to location.”26 The central concept of GIS is a stack  of data layers united by common spatial coordinates. There is an  obvious conceptual connection to the use of layers in Photoshop  and  other  media  software  applications—however,  GIS  systems  work  with  any  data  that  has  geospatial  coordinates  rather  than  only images positioned on separate layers. The geospatial coordi- nates  align  different  data  sets  together.  As  used  by  professionals,  “maps” constructed with GIS software may contain hundreds or  even thousands of layers. The layers representation is also used in  consumer  applications  such  as  Google  Earth.  However,  while  in  professional applications such as ArcGIS users can create their own  layered  maps  from  any  data  sources,  in  Google  Earth  users  can  only add their own data to the base representation of Earth that is  provided by Google and cannot be modified.  In the GIS paradigm, space functions as a media platform which    can  hold  all  kinds  of  data  types  together—points,  2D  outlines,  maps, images, video, numerical data, text, links, etc.  Other types  of such media platforms commonly used today are databases, web  pages,  and  spaces  created  via  3D  compositing  that  I  will  discuss  later  in  the  book .  In  Photoshop  the  layers  are  still  conceptually   26 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki GIS  October 9, 2011 .   144   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  subordinated  to  the  final  image—when  you  are  using  the  appli- cation, it continuously renders all visible layers together to show  this image. So although you can use a Photoshop image as a kind  of  media  database—a  way  to  collect  together  different  image  elements—this  is  not  the  intended  use   you  are  supposed  to  use  separate programs such as Adobe Bridge or Aperture to do that .  GIS takes the idea of a layered representation further. When profes- sional users work with GIS applications, they may never output a  single  map  that  would  contain  all  the  data.  Instead,  users  select  the data they need to work with at that moment and then perform  various  operations  on  this  data   practically,  this  means  selecting  a subset of all data layers available . If a traditional map offers a  fixed  representation,  GIS,  as  its  name  implies,  is  an  information  system: a way to manage and work with a large sets of separate  data entities linked together—in this case, via a shared coordinate  system.   From programming techniques to   digital compositing  What is the conceptual origin of Layers in Photoshop? Where do  Layers  belong  in  relation  to  my  taxonomies  of  software-based  media  techniques?  Thinking  about  various  possible  sources  of  this concept and also considering how it relates to other modern  media editing techniques takes us in a number of different direc- tions. First of all, layers are not specific to raster image editors such  as Photoshop; this technique is also used in vector image editors   Illustrator ,  motion  graphics  and  compositing  software   After  Effects , video editors  Final Cut , and sound editors  Pro Tools .  In  programs  that  work  with  time-based  data—sound  editors,  animation and compositing programs, and video and film editors— layers  are  usually  referred  to  as  “channels”  or  “tracks”;  these  different  terms  point  to  particular  physical  and  electronic  media  which  a  corresponding  digital  application  has  replaced   analog  video switchers, multitrack audio recorders . Despite the difference  in  terms,  the  technique  functions  in  the  same  way  in  all  these  applications: a final composition is a result of a “adding up” data   technically, a composite  stored in different layers channels tracks.       UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    145    Photoshop  Help  explains  Layers  in  the  following  way:  “Photoshop  layers  are  like  sheets  of  stacked  acetate.  You  can  see  through  transparent  areas  of  a  layer  to  the  layers  below.”   Photoshop CS4 Help, “About layers.”27  Although not explicitly  named  by  this  Help  article,  the  reference  here  is  to  the  standard  technique  of  twentieth-century  commercial.  Like  a  film  camera  mounted  above  the  animation  stand,  Photoshop  software  is  “shooting”  the  image  created  through  a  juxtaposition  of  visual  elements contained on separate layers.   It  is  not  surprising  that  Photoshop  Layers  are  closely  related  to  twentieth-century visual media techniques such as cel animation, as  well as to various practices of pre-digital compositing such as multiple  exposure,  background  projection,  mattes  in  filmmaking,  and  video  keying.28  However,  there  is  also  a  strong  conceptual  link  between  image  Layers  and  twentieth-century  music  technology.  The  use  of  layers  in  media  software  to  separate  different  elements  of  a  visual  and or  temporal  composition  strongly  parallels  the  earlier  practice  of multitrack audio recording. The inventor of multitrack recording  was the guitarist Les Paul; in 1953 he commissioned Ampex to build  the first eight-track recorder. In the 1960s multi-track recorders were  already being used by Frank Zappa, the Beach Boys, and the Beatles;  from  that  point  on,  multitrack  recording  became  the  standard  practice for all music recording and arranging.29 Originally a bulky  and  very  expensive  machine,  a  multi-track  recorder  was  eventually  simulated  in  software  and  is  now  available  in  many  applications.  For instance, since 2004 Apple has included the multitrack recorder  and  editor  GarageBand  on  all  its  new  computers.  Other  popular  software implementations include the free application Audacity and  the professional-level application Pro Tools.   Finally, yet another lead links Layers to a general principle of  modern computer programming. In 1984, two computer scientists  Thomas  Porter  and  Thomas  Duff  working  for  ILM   Industrial  Light  and  Magic,  a  special  effects  unit  of  Lucasfilm   formally   27 http:  help.adobe.com en_US Photoshop 11.0   October 9, 2011 . 28 The  chapter  “Compositing”  in  The  Language  of  New  Media  presents  an  “archeology” of digital compositing that discusses the links between these earlier  technologies. Lev Manovich, The Language of New Media  The MIT Press, 2001.  29 See  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Multitrack_tape_recorder  and  http:  en.wikipedia. org wiki History_of_multitrack_recording   146   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  defined  the  concept  of  digital  compositing  in  a  paper  presented  at  SIGGRAPH.30  The  concept  emerged  from  the  work  ILM  was  doing on special effects scenes for 1982’s Star Trek II: The Wrath  of Khan. The key idea was to render each separate element with a  matte channel containing transparency information. This allowed  the  filmmakers  to  create  each  element  separately  and  then  later  combine them into a photorealistic 3D scene.   Porter  and  Duff’s  paper  makes  an  analogy  between  creating  a  final  scene  by  compositing  3D  elements  and  assembling  separate  code modules into a complete computer program. As Porter and  Duff  explain,  the  experience  of  writing  software  in  this  way  led  them to consider using the same strategy for making images and  animations. In both cases, the parts can be re-used to make new  wholes:   Experience has taught us to break down large bodies of source  code into separate modules in order to save compilation time.  An  error  in  one  routine  forces  only  the  recompilation  of  its  module and the relatively quick reloading of the entire program.  Similarly,  small  errors  in  coloration  or  design  in  one  object  should not force “recompilation” of the entire image.31  The same idea of treating an image as a collection of elements that  can be changed independently and re-assembled into new images is  behind Photoshop Layers. Importantly, Photoshop was developed  at the same place where the principles of digital compositing were  defined  earlier.  Brothers  Thomas  and  John  Knoll  wrote  the  first  version of the program when Thomas took a six-month leave from  the PhD program at the University of Michigan in 1988 to join his  brother who was then working at ILM.   This  link  between  a  popular  software  technique  for  image  editing and a general principle of modern computer programming  is  very  telling.  It  is  a  perfect  example  of  how  all  elements  of  the  modern  media  software  ecosystem—applications,  file  formats,  interfaces,  techniques,  tools  and  algorithms  used  to  create,  view,  edit, and share media content—have not just one but two parents,   30 Thomas  Porter  and  Tom  Duff,  “Compositing  Digital  Images,”  Computer  Graphics, vol. 18, no. 3  July 1984 : p. 253–9. 31 Ibid.      UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    147  each with their own set of DNA: media and cultural practices on  the one hand, and software development on the other.    In short, through the work of many people, from Ivan Sutherland  in early 1960s, to the teams at ILM, Macromedia, Adobe, Apple  and  other  companies  in  the  1980s  and  1990s,  media  becomes  software—with all the theoretical and practical consequences such  a transition entails. This section dives into Photoshop’s Filter and  Layers  menus  to  discuss  some  of  these  consequences—but  more  still remain to be uncovered.  There is only software  What  exactly  is  “new  media”  and  how  is  it  different  from  “old  media”? Academics, new media artists, and journalists have been  writing  extensively  about  this  question  since  the  early  1990s.  In  many  of  these  discussions,  a  single  term  came  to  stand  for  the  whole  range  of  new  technologies,  new  expressive  and  communi- cative possibilities, new forms of community and sociality that were  emerging around computers and Internet. The term is “digital.” It  received  its  official  seal  of  approval,  so  to  speak,  in  1996  when  the director of MIT Media Lab Nicholas Negroponte collected his  Wired columns into the book that he named Being Digital.32 Many  years  later,  the  term  “digital”  still  dominates  both  popular  and  academic understanding of what new media is about.    When  I  did  Google  searches  for  “digital,”  “interactive,”  and  “multimedia”  on  August  28,  2009,  the  first  search  returned  757  million results; the other two only returned 235 and 240 million  respectively. Making searches on Google Scholar produced similar  results: 10,800,000 for “digital,” 4,150,000 for “web,” 3,920,000  for “software,” 2,760,000 for “interactive,” 1,870,000 for “multi- media.” Clearly, Negroponte was right: we have become digital.   I do not need to convince anybody today about the transform- ative effects the Internet, the web, and other technological networks  have already had on human culture and society. However, what I  do want to convince you of is the crucial role of another part of  the computer revolution that has been less discussed. And yet, if we   32 Nicholas Negroponte, Being Digital  Vintage, 1996 .   148   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  really want to understand the forms of contemporary media and  also what “media” means today, this part is crucial. The part in  question is software.   None  of  the  new  media  authoring  and  editing  techniques  we  associate  with  computers  are  simply  a  result  of  media  “being  digital.”  The  new  ways  of  media  access,  distribution,  analysis,  generation, and manipulation all come from software. Which also  means  that  they  are  the  result  of  the  particular  choices  made  by  individuals, companies, and consortiums who develop software— media  authoring  and  editing  applications,  compression  codecs,  file formats, programming and scripting languages used to create  interactive and dynamic media such as PHP and JavaScript. Some  of these choices determine conventions and protocols which define  modern  software  environments:  for  instance,  “cut”  and  “paste”  commands built into all software running under the Graphical User  Interface and its newer versions  such as iPhone OS , or one-way  hyperlinks as implemented in World Wide Web technology. Other  choices  are  specific  to  particular  types  of  software   for  instance,  illustration programs  or individual software packages.  If particular software techniques or interface metaphors which    appear  in  one  application—be  it  a  desktop  program,  web  appli- cation,  or  mobile  app—become  popular  with  its  users,  they  may  often soon appear in other apps. For example, after Flickr added  tag clouds to its interface, they soon appeared on numerous other  websites. The appearance of particular techniques in applications  can also be traced to the economics of the software industry—for  instance,  when  one  software  company  buys  another  company,  it  may merge its existing package with the software from the company  it bought. For instance, in 1995 Silicon Graphics bought two 3D  computer graphics suites—Wavefront and Alias—and merged them  into a new product called AliasWavefront. Big companies such as  Google  and  Facebook  are  periodically  buying  smaller  companies  and then adding the software products these companies develop to  their own offerings. Thus, one of Google’s most popular applica- tions, Google Earth is based on software originally developed by  Keyhole, Inc. and acquired by Google in 2004.   Often,  techniques  created  for  one  purpose  later  migrate  into  another area, as happened when image processing techniques made  their  way  into  Photoshop  in  the  late  1980s.  These  techniques,  developed  in  the  second  half  of  the  1950s  for  the  analysis  of       UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    149  reconnaissance  photographs,  are  now  used  to  creatively  modify  images and to make photographs more “artistic looking.”   All  these  software  mutations  and  new  species  of  software  techniques  are  deeply  social—they  do  not  simply  come  from  individual minds or from some “essential” properties of a digital  computer  or  a  computer  network.  They  come  from  software  developed by groups of people, marketed to large numbers of users,  and  then  constantly  refined  and  expanded  to  stay  competitive  in  relation  to  other  products  in  the  same  market  category.   Google  and  Facebook  update  their  code  a  few  times  a  day;  GitHub,  the  popular software hosting services, updates its code dozens of times  a day.    In summary: the techniques, the tools, and the conventions of  media  software  applications  are  not  the  result  of  a  technological  change  from  “analog”  to  “digital”  media.  The  shift  to  digital  enables  the  development  of  media  software—but  it  does  not  constrain the directions in which it already evolved and continues  to  evolve.  They  are  the  result  of  intellectual  ideas  conceived  by  the  pioneers  working  in  larger  labs,  the  actual  products  created  by software companies and open source communities, the cultural  and social processes set up when many people and companies start  using it, and software market forces and constraints.   This means that the terms “digital media” and “new media” do  not capture very well the uniqueness of the “digital revolution.”  I  like the term “media computing”—however it is not used widely  apart  from  some  communities  in  computer  science  primarily  in  Europe . Why do they not work? Because all the new qualities of  “digital media” are not situated “inside” the media objects. Rather,  they  all  exist  “outside”—as  commands  and  techniques  of  media  viewers, authoring software, animation, compositing, and editing  software,  game  engine  software,  wiki  software,  and  all  other  software “species.” While digital representation makes it possible  for  computers  to  work  with  images,  text,  3D  forms,  sounds  and  other  media  types  in  principle,  it  is  the  software  that  determines  what we can do with them. So while we are indeed “being digital,”  the actual forms of this “being” come from software.   Accepting  the  centrality  of  software  puts  in  question  another  fundamental  concept  of  aesthetic  and  media  theory—that  of  the  “properties of a medium.” What does it mean to refer to a “digital  medium”  as  having  “properties”?  For  example,  is  it  meaningful    150   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  to talk about unique properties of digital photographs, electronic  texts, or websites? In their article, Kay and Goldberg do pair the  words  “properties”  and  “medium”  together:  “It  [electronic  text]  need not be treated as a simulated paper book since this is a new  medium  with  new  properties.”  I  have  also  frequently  used  this  combination of words—but it is now time to ask if it is only an  alias that can point us to a more precise concept.    Strictly speaking, while it is certainly convenient to talk about  properties of websites, digital images, 3D models, GIS representa- tions, etc., it is not accurate. Different types of digital content do  not have any properties by themselves. What as users we experience  as properties of media content comes from software used to create,  edit, present, and access this content.    This  includes  all  media  authoring  and  viewing  application  software  made  for  both  professionals  and  consumers,  from  Photoshop to your mobile web browser.  It also includes custom  software developed for particular products such as a DVD menu  or an interactive kiosk.  So while I will continue to use the term  “properties”  as  a  shortcut,  you  should  always  remember  that  it  stands for software techniques defined to work on particular types  of media ecologies, content and media data.  Flickr’s whole system  for  uploading,  tagging,  organizing,  commenting,  and  sharing  images  is  an  example  of  “media  ecology”;  a  raster  24-bit  image  stored in JPEG format is an example of a type of “media data.”    It  is  important  to  make  clear  that  I  am  not  saying  that  today  all the differences between media types—continuous tone images,  vector  images,  simple  text,  formatted  text,  3D  models,  anima- tions,  video,  maps,  music,  etc.—are  completely  determined  by  application  software.  Obviously,  these  media  data  types  have  different  representational  and  expressive  capabilities;  they  can  produce different emotional effects; they are processed by different  sensors and networks of neurons in the brain; and they are likely to  correspond to different types of mental processes and mental repre- sentations. These differences have been discussed for thousands of  years—from  ancient  philosophy  and  classical  aesthetic  theory  to  modern art and contemporary neuroscience. What I am arguing in  this book is something else. Firstly, interactive software adds a new  set of operations which can be applied to all media types—which  we as users experience as their new “properties.”  The examples  include  the  ability  to  display  the  same  data  structure  in  different       UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    151  ways,  hyperlinking,  visualization,  searchability,  and  findability.   Secondly,  the  “properties”  of  a  particular  media  type  can  vary  dramatically  depending  on  the  software  application  used  for  its  authoring and access.   Let  us  go  though  one  example  in  detail.  As  an  example  of  a  media  type,  we  will  use  a  photograph.  In  the  analog  era,  once  a  photograph was printed, all the information was “fixed.” Looking  at this photograph at home, in an exhibition, or in a book did not  affect this information. Certainly, a photographer could produce a  different print with a higher or a lower contrast or use a different  paper—but  this  resulted  in  a  physically  different  object,  i.e.,  a  new photographic print that contained different information.  For  example, some details were lost if the contrast was increased.     So  what  happens  with  a  digital  photograph?  We  can  take  a  photo with a dedicated digital camera or capture it with a mobile  phone, or scan it from an old book. In every case, we end up with  a file that contains an array of pixels which hold color values, and  a file header that specifies image dimensions, color profile, infor- mation  about  the  camera  and  shot  conditions  such  as  exposure,  and  other  metadata.  In  other  words,  we  end  up  with  what  is  normally called “digital media”—a file containing numbers which  represent the details of some scene or an object.    However,  unless  you  are  a  programmer,  you  never  directly  deal with these numbers. Instead, most of us interact with digital  media  files  via  some  application  software.  And  depending  on  which software you use, what you can do with a particular digital  media file can change dramatically. MMS  multimedia messaging  service  software on your phone may simply display a photo sent  by a friend—and allow you to forward it to somebody else—but  nothing else.    Free media viewers players that run on desktops or on mobile  platforms  typically  give  you  more  functions.  For  instance,  a  desktop  version  of  Google’s  Picasa  3.0  includes  crop,  auto  color,  red  eye  reduction,  variety  of  filters   soft  focus,  glow,  etc.   and  a  number of other functions. It can also display the same photo as  color  or  black  and  white—without  modifying  the  actual  digital  media file.    Finally,  if  I  open  the  same  photo  in  Photoshop,  I  can  instruct  Photoshop  to  automatically  replace  some  colors  in  a  photo  with  others,  make  visible  its  linear  structure  by  running  an  edge    152   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  detection filter, blur it in a dozen of different ways, composite with  another photo, and perform hundreds of other operations.    To  summarize  this  discussion,  let  me  make  a  bold  statement.  There is no such thing as “digital media.” There is only software— as applied to media  or “content” . Or, to put this differently: for  users  who  only  interact  with  media  content  through  application  software,  the  “properties”  of  digital  media  are  defined  by  the  particular  software  as  opposed  to  solely  being  contained  in  the  actual content  i.e., inside digital files .    “Digital  media”  is  a  result  of  the  gradual  development  and  accumulation of a large number of software techniques, algorithms,  data  structures,  and  interface  conventions  and  metaphors.  These  techniques  exist  at  different  levels  of  generality  ranging  from  a  small  number  of  very  general   “media-independent”   ones  to  thousands  of  very  particular  ones  designed  to  do  particular  tasks—for  example,  algorithms  used  to  generate  natural-looking  landscapes or software which can extract the camera position from  live action footage in order to correctly align a 3D model when it  is composited with this footage.    Because  of  the  multiplicity  and  variety  of  these  software  techniques, it is unwise to try to reduce “digital media” to a small  set  of  new  properties.  Such  reduction  would  only  be  possible  if  we  could  organize  all  these  techniques  hierarchically,  seeing  them  as  different  applications  of  a  few  general  principles.  After  thinking on and off about this for ten years  starting with my 1999  article  “Avant-Garde  as  Software”  where  I  first  tried  to  provide  a  taxonomy  of  these  new  techniques   I  eventually  came  to  the  conclusion that such hierarchy will only mislead us. The reason is  that all these techniques equally change the identity of any media  type to which they are applied.   The  fact  that  one  technique  may  appear  in  many  software  packages  designed  to  work  with  different  media  types   what  I  called  “media-independent”  techniques   while  another  technique  may  be  specific  to  a  particular  type  of  media   I  called  these  techniques  “media-specific”   does  not  make  the  latter  any  less  theoretically  important  than  the  former.  For  instance,  because  a  zoom  function  is  present  in  word  processors,  media  viewers,  animation  software,  3D  modeling  software,  web  browsers,  etc.,  this does not make it more important than the algorithm designed  to do only one particular thing in relation to one media type—for       UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    153  instance, a “spherize” command which modifies coordinates of all  the points in a 3D polygonal model so it appears more spherical.    I  do  not  think  that  we  can  qualitatively  measure  the  practical  effects on cultural production of both types of operations in this  example to conclude that one is more radical than the other. Both  operations  change  the  media  they  act  upon  qualitatively,  rather  than quantitatively. They both add new qualities  or “affordances”   to media which it did have before. A Word document which can  be zoomed across multiple scales to reveal many pages at once has  a different “media identity” from one which cannot. Similarly, the  ability to precisely spherize a 3D model is a new way of working  with a spatial form that did not exist before 3D software.  In  Avant-Garde  as  Software  I  grouped  all  new  techniques  of    digital media into four types based on what functions they support:  access,  generation,  manipulation,  and  analysis.  But  even  such  simple  differentiation  appears  problematic  to  me  today—partly  because  of  the  evolution  of  software  since  1999,  which  led  to  a  gradual  integration  of  these  functions.  For  example,  when  a  user selects a media file on his her laptop, tablet or a phone, the  file  automatically  opens  in  a  media  player viewer  program.  And  today  most  media  viewers  and  players   Windows  Media  Player,  Apple’s QuickTime Player, etc.  offer some basic editing functions.  Therefore,  in  practical  terms  today  you  cannot  simply  “access”  media without automatically being offered some ways to “modify”  it.   To  be  clear,  I  am  talking  here  about  personal  computers  and  mobile devices and not specialized hardware specifically designed  to  offer  only  access,  and  to  prevent  modification  of  commercial  digital content—such as DVD players or MP3 players.    How did we arrive at this new situation where instead of looking  at  or  reading  content  directly,  most  of  us  always  experience  it  through the layer of applications? The seemingly obvious answer  is  the  adoption  of  numerical  code  as  the  new  universal  inter- mediary.  I  call  it  intermediary  because  in  order  to  make  media  accessible  to  our  senses,  it  has  to  be  analog—a  travelling  wave  of oscillating pressure which we experience as sound, the voltage  levels applied to the pixel elements of an LCD which makes them  appear as different colors, different amounts of dyes deposited on  paper  by  dye-sublimation  printers,  and  so  on.  Such  conversions  from  A  to  D   analog  to  digital   and  D  to  A   digital  to  analog   are central for digital media functioning: for example, from light    154   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  waves to numbers stored in a file representing the image, and then  back  to  the  voltage  levels  controlling  the  display.  Or,  in  another  example, when we design an object to be printed on a 3D printer,  an analog representation on the screen is translated by a computer  into a digital file that then drives the analog signals controlling the  printer.   The  two  levels  of  encoding—first,  a  sampling  of  a  continuous  analog signal to create its representation using a scale of discrete  numbers   for  example,  256  levels  commonly  used  to  represent  grey  tones  in  images ,  followed  by  a  translation  of  this  discrete  representation  into  a  binary  numerical  system—make  “media”  incomprehensible for direct observation. The main reason for this  is not the binary code per se  invented by the Indian scholar Pingala  between the fifth and second century bc  since it is possible to learn  how to convert in your head a binary notation into a decimal one.  The problem is that representing even one image digitally requires  lots  of  numbers.  For  example,  an  image  in  HD  resolution   1920  ×  1080   contains  2,073,600  pixels,  or  6,220,800  distinct  RGB  values—making  it  very  hard  to  comprehend  the  patterns  such  a  set  of  numbers  may  represent  if  you  examine  them  directly.   In  passing:  because  of  these  considerations,  any  digital  image  can  be  understand  as  information  visualization—revealing  patterns  contained in its numerical representation.     Because looking at such sets of numbers with our bare eyes is  meaningless,  we  need  to  employ  some  technologies  to  translate  them  into  analog  representations  acceptable  to  our  senses.  Most  often, an image file is translated by digital hardware and software  into an image appearing on our screen. However, a digital repre- sentation of one type of media can also be translated into another  media type that is meaningful to our senses. For example, in audio- visual performances software often uses video to drive sound, or  reversely uses sound to generate abstract visuals.  Interestingly, the  precursor to Edison’s 1877 phonograph—the first device to record  and  reproduce  sound—was  Édouard-Léon  Scott  de  Martinville’s  1857 phonautograph that transcribed sound into a visual media.  In  other  words,  sound  visualization  was  invented  before  sound  recording and reproduction.    From the beginning, technologies that generated and transmitted  electro-magnetic analog signals  e.g, the gramophone  included at  least  some  controls  for  its  modification  such  as  changing  signal       UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    155  amplitude. The first well-known electronic instrument invented by  Léon Theremin in 1920 turned such controls into a new paradigm  for music performance. A performer controlled amplitude  volume   and frequency  pitch  of a sound by moving his her hands closer or  further away from the two antennas.    Software significantly extends this principle by including more  controls and more ways of representing the data. For example, I  can  choose  to  display  this  text  I  am  writing  now  in  Word  as  an  outline, or select a “Print Layout” which will show me boundaries  of  pages;  I  can  choose  to  see  footnotes  or  hide  them;  I  can  ask  the application to automatically summarize the text; I can change  different font families and sizes, and so on. Thus, while the actual  data  as  it  is  represented  and  stored  in  a  computer  is  no  longer  directly accessible to our senses, the new model of encoding and  access  has  other  significant  advantages  since  the  data  can  be  formatted  in  a  variety  of  ways.  This  formatting  can  be  changed  interactively; it can be also stored with the data and recalled later.    This discussion can help us to understand the relations between  earlier  electro-magnetic  recording  and  reproduction  technologies,  which were developed in the last decades of the nineteenth century,  and  media  software  developed  100  years  later.   Telephone:  Bell,  1875; phonograph: Edison, 1878; television: Nipkow, 1884; radio:  Fessenden, 1900.  While previous reproduction technologies such  as  woodblock  printing,  moveable  type  printing,  printmaking,  lithography, and photography retained the original form of media,  the  media  technologies  of  the  late  nineteenth  century  abandoned  it in favor of an electrical signal. In other words, they introduced  coding  as  a  way  to  store  and  transmit  media.  Simultaneously,  these  technologies  also  introduced  a  fundamentally  new  layer  of  media—interface, i.e. the ways to represent  “format”  and control  the signal. And this in its turn changes how media functions—its  “properties”  were  no  longer  solely  contained  in  the  data  but  were  now  also  depend  on  the  interface  provided  by  technology  manufacturers.   The  shift  to  digital  data  and  media  software  100  years  later  generalized  this  principle  to  all  media.  With  all  data  types  now  encoded as sets of numbers, they can only be accessed by users via  software applications which translate these numbers into sensory  representations. The consequence of this is what we have already  discussed: all “properties of digital media” are now defined by the    156   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  particular  software  as  opposed  to  solely  being  contained  in  the  actual content, i.e. digital files. So what was already true for audio  recording,  radio,  television,  and  video  now  also  applies  to  text,  images, and 3D.     In short: media becomes software.  I  could  conclude  this  chapter  here—however  we  need  to  do  one  more  thing.  It  would  be  unfair  to  direct  all  this  attention  to  the  term “digital media” without also taking up another term related  to it. Today this term is both widely used and also often put into  question. The term is “new media.”    Since we now understand that “media” today is really a set of  software  techniques  constantly  in  development,  this  gives  a  new  meaning to this troubled term. Just as there is no logical limit to the  number  of  algorithms  which  can  be  invented,  people  can  always  develop new software techniques for working with media. So from  this perspective, the term “new media” captures well this funda- mental  logic  of  “the  computer  metamedium.”  Software-based  media  will  always  be  “new”  as  long  as  new  techniques  continue  to  be  invented  and  added  to  those  that  already  exist.  And  while  not  every  one  of  these  techniques  will  change  significantly  how  particular  media  or  a  combination  of  media  will  function,  many  will.    This  logic  of  “permanent  extendability”  of  media  software  follows the logic of software engineering as a whole. Computer scien- tists  working  in  the  academy  and  software companies  constantly  develop modifications of the existing algorithms, apply algorithms  from  one  area  in  another  area,  and  develop  new  algorithms.  This logic—which can be also called “permanent innovation”—is  different from the logic which governed the development of media  technologies of the industrial age. Take cinema, for instance, from  1890 to 1990,  i.e. until the adoption of software tools by the film  industry . Although the construction of film lenses, the properties  and types of film stock, the operations of film camera, and other  elements of film technology changed dramatically over the course  of  the  twentieth  century,  the  basic  “representational  capacity”  of  this  image  type  remained  the  same.  From  Edison  to  George  Lucas, film images continued to be produced in the same way: by  focusing  light  reflected  from  the  objects  via  lens  on  a  flat  plane.  This type of capture process creates particular types of images of       UNDERSTANDING  METAMEDIA    157  visible reality. Objects are rendered in one-point linear perspective.  This means that the geometric properties of any scene regardless  of its content are subjected to the same type of transformation— the  same  mapping  that  preserves  some  properties  of  the  visible   perspective  distortion  related  to  distance  of  objects  from  the  observer  as opposed to other properties  the real proportions of  object sizes, for example . Additionally once a recording was made,  the geometry of the image could not be modified later.   Once  software  enters  the  picture,  these  constants  of  the  film  medium  become  variables.  While  looking  no  less  “real,”  film  image  can  now  have  multiple  relationships  to  the  world  being  imaged.  Digital  compositing  allows  for  the  seamless  insertion  of  3D  computer-generated  models  that  were  not  present  in  the  original  scene.  Conversely,  the  objects  that  were  present  can  be  seamlessly  removed  from  images.  Interactive  virtual  panoramas  which allow the user to move around the space can be constructed  automatically. In some cases, it is even possible to re-render a film  sequence as though it was shot from a different point of view. And  these are just some of the new ways in which new software changes  film identity.  All these new possibilities, of course, also apply to  video.     PART TWO  Hybridization  and evolution    CHAPTER THREE  Hybridization  Hybridity vs. multimedia   “The  first  metamedium”  envisioned  by  Kay  and  Goldberg  in  1977  has  gradually  become  a  reality  in  the  1990s.  Beginning  with  Sketchpad  and  extending  to  the  latest  versions  of  media  software, most physical media were simulated in detail and many  new  properties  were  added  to  them  in  the  process.  In  parallel,  a  number of brand new computational media which have no physical  precedents were also invented—for instance, interactive navigable  3D  space   Ivan  Sutherland ,  interactive  multimedia   Architecture  Machine Group’s Aspen Movie Map ; hypertext and hypermedia   Ted  Nelson ;  interactive  narrative  film   Graham  Weinbren ;  the  Internet   Licklider,  Bob  Taylor,  Larry  Roberts,  and  others ;  the  World  Wide  Web   Tim  Berners-Lee ;  social  media  services   SixDegrees.com ,1  collaborative  large-scale  authoring  platforms  such as Wikipedia  Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger , and so on.   New  fundamental  techniques  for  media  generation,  manipu- lation,  and  presentation  which  also  had  no  previous  physical  equivalent  were  also  developed—algorithmic  generation  of  line  images,  3D  photorealistic  rending,  and  the  constraints  originally  introduced  in  Sketchpad.  New  media-specific  and  general   i.e.,     1 D.  M.  Boyd  and  N.  B.  Ellison,  “Social  network  sites:  Definition,  history,  and  scholarship,” Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13 1   2007 , http:   jcmc.indiana.edu vol13 issue1 boyd.ellison.html   162   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  media-agnostic   data  management  techniques  were  introduced.  Most importantly, by the middle of the 1990s computers became  fast  enough  to  “run”  all  these  media.  In  short,  Kay’s  vision  of  a  computer as metamedium—a platform housing many existing and  new media—was realized.   So what happens next? What is the next stage in the metamedium  development?  I am using the word “stage” here in a logical rather  than  a  historical  sense .  This  is  something  that,  as  far  as  I  can  see,  the  inventors  of  computational  media—Sutherland,  Nelson,  Engelbart, Kay and all the people who worked with them—did not  write about. However, since they set up all the conditions for this  next stage, they are indirectly responsible for it.    The  discussion  of  the  computer  metamedium  at  the  end  of  Kay  and  Goldberg’s  1977  article  creates  the  impression  that  it  would develop via additions, as users built new types of media  to  suit  their  needs  using  the  tools  provided  with  the  personal  computer.  Looking  at  the  actual  development  of  the  computer  metamedium  over  the  following  thirty  years  seems  to  confirm  this conclusion.    For  instance,  if  we  look  at  the  use  of  computer  media  in  art  which begins in the second half of the 1950s  music composition  and algorithmic image generation , by 2003 the authoritative book  Digital Art by Christine Paul already lists dozen of different areas.  A  Wikipedia  article  on  “Collaborative  software”  similarly  lists  about a dozen program types  and of course there are dozens or  hundreds of separate products for each type .2 Another Wikipedia  article  on  “Social  Software”3  lists  twenty  major  types  of  social  media  instant messaging, text chat, groupware, blogs, etc. —and  none of them existed in practice in the early computer days of the  1960s.    To  continue  with  these  examples  of  such  additions,  a  typical  visual  design  created  today  with  software  applications  may  also  appear  as  a  simple  sum  of  previous  media:  for  example,  a  pen  drawing plus oil painting plus a photograph plus collage. Looking  at the interfaces of media editing software seems to also confirm  this impression. You see endless options for modifying a document,  appearing one after another in multiple menus. As the new options     2 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Collaborative_software  February 4, 2012 .   3 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Social_software  February 4, 2012 .      HybRIDIzATION    163  become  available—because  software  manufacture  has  released  a  new  version,  or  you  have  purchased  some  plug-ins  of  your  own—they appear as additions in the same menus. And certainly,  the  overall  number  of  commands  in  popular  media  applications  gradually increases over time from release to release—adding more  techniques  for  authoring,  editing,  remixing,  and  creating  outputs  for different distribution platforms.    However, these processes of addition and accumulation are not  the  only  ones  defining  evolution  of  the  computer  metamedium.  While they are certainly at work, I think that they are not in the  center  of  the  transformation—or  if  you  like,  mutation—of  this  metamedium   and  by  extension,  of  all  modern  culture  created  via  software   in  the  three  decades  following  Kay  and  Goldberg’s  seminal article in 1977.  I use this year—of course, only symboli- cally—to  mark  the  completion  of  the  first  “media  invention”  stage.     I believe that the new period that began in the late 1970s repre- sents a fundamentally distinct second stage in the development of  a computer metamedium, a stage that follows the first stage of its  invention  and  initial  practical  implementation.  This  new  stage  is  media hybridization.    Once computers became a comfortable home for a large number  of  simulated  and  new  media,  it  is  only  logical  to  expect  that  they  would  start  creating  hybrids.  And  this  is  exactly  what  has  been taking place at this new stage in media evolution. Both the  simulated and new media types—text, hypertext, still photographs,  digital video, 2D animation, 3D animation, navigable 3D spaces,  maps,  location  information  and  social  software  tools—came  to  function as building blocks for many new media combinations.    Here  are  some  examples  of  computational  media  hybrids.  Google Earth combines aerial photography, satellite imagery, 3D  computer  graphics,  still  photography,  and  other  media  to  create  a  new  hybrid  representation  which  Google  engineers  called  a  “3D  interface  to  the  planet.”  A  motion  graphics  sequence  may  combine content and techniques from different media such as live  action  video,  3D  computer  animation,  2D  animation,  painting,  and drawing.  Motion graphics are animated visuals that surround  us  every  day;  the  examples  are  film  and  television  titles,  TV  graphics, the graphics for mobile media content, and non-narrative  parts  of  commercials  and  music  videos.   A  website  design  may    164   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  blend  photos,  typography,  vector  graphics,  interactive  elements,  and  animation.  Physical  installations  integrated  into  cultural  and  commercial spaces—for example, Nobel Field at the Nobel Peace  Center in Oslo by Small Design, interactive store displays for Nokia  and Diesel by Nanika, or the interactive Memory Wall at Puerta  America hotel in Madrid by Karen Finlay and Jason Bruges, and  so on—combine animations, video, computer control, and various  interfaces from sensors to touch, to create interactive spatial media  environments.4    The  built-in  dictionary  of  Microsoft  Word  which  I  am  using  to  write  this  text  has  a  few  definitions  for  “hybrid”  including  the  following:  “a  plant  produced  from  a  cross  between  plants  with  different  genetic  constituents”;  and  “an  animal  that  results  from mating of parents from two distinct species or subspecies.”  These biological meanings of “hybrid” capture well what has been  happening to media following its “softwarization” in the 1980s and  1990s—that is, the systematic translation of numerous techniques for  media creation and editing from physical, mechanical, and electronic  technologies into software tools. Translated into software, media  techniques start acting like species within a common ecology—in  this case, a shared software environment. Once “released” into this  environment, they start interacting, mutating, and making hybrids.    If  we  want  to  relate  the  beginning  of  the  new  hybridization  stage  to  some  important  projects  and  technologies  in  the  history  of computational media, the famous Aspen Movie Map interactive  hypermedia system developed at MIT in 1978–9 would qualify as  the  starting  point.5  A  precursor  to  Google  Street  View   launched  in 2007 , the system combined film of streets in Aspen, still photo- graphs,  a  navigation  map  that  featured  both  aerial  photography  and diagrammatic drawings, and audio. The second key event is the  release of QuickTime multimedia software by Apple on December  2, 1991 as an addition to System Software 6. As Apple explained  in “QuickTime 1.0: ‘You Oughta be in Pictures” technical article   Summer 1991 : “The recently introduced QuickTime 1.0 makes it  easy for you to add dynamic media like video and sound into your     4  http:  www.davidsmall.com articles 2006 06 01 nobel-field ;  http:  www.nanikawa. com ; http:  www.jasonbruges.com projects international-projects memory-wall   5 “The Interactive Movie Map: A Surrogate Travel System,” video,  The Architecture  Machine, 1981 , http:  www.media.mit.edu speech videos       HybRIDIzATION    165  applications – and that’s just the beginning.”6 In the next ten years,  commercial  developers,  engineers,  designers,  and  independent  media  artists  put  lots  of  their  creative  energy  into  exploring  the  new ability of a computer to present multiple media. Thus, I think  of the 1990s as the foundational period when many fundamental  ways  of  combining  media  within  the  single  computer  platform  were invented—followed by the next period of commercialization  of  these  inventions  in  the  2000s   for  example,  Google  Earth,  introduced  in  2005   and  adoption  to  mobile  platforms   iPhone,  introduced  in  2007,  was  able  to  play  video  and  songs,  display  photos and hybrid maps, and send MMS .    To  start  the  discussion  of  media  hybridity,  it  is  important  to  make  it  clear  that  I  am  not  simply  talking  about  something  that  already  has  a  name—“computer  multimedia,”  or  simply  “multi- media.”  This  term  became  popular  in  the  1990s  to  describe  applications  and  electronic  documents  in  which  different  media  types exist next to each other.    Often these media types—typically text, graphics, photographs,  video,  3D  scenes,  and  sound—are  situated  within  what  looks  visually like a two-dimensional page. Thus a typical Web page of  the 2000s is an example of multimedia; so is a typical PowerPoint  presentation. Today, at least, this is the still the most common way  of  structuring  multimedia  documents.  In  fact,  it  is  built  into  the  workings of most media authoring application such as presentation  software or web design software. When a user of Word, PowerPoint  or Dreamweaver creates a “new document,” s he is presented with  a white page ready to display typed text; other media types have to  be “inserted” into this page via special commands. But interfaces  for  creating  “multimedia”  do  not  necessarily  have  to  follow  this  convention. Email and multimedia messaging use another common  paradigm for putting elements of different media types together— “attachments.” Thus, a user of a mobile phone that supports MMS  can send text messages with attachments that can include picture,  sound,  video  and  rich   formatted   text.  Yet  another  paradigm  persistent  in  digital  culture—from  Aspen  Movie  Map   1978   to  VRML   1994–   to  Second  Life   2003– —uses  3D  space  as  the     6 Apple,  “QuickTime  1.0:  ‘You  Oughta  be  in  Pictures”   summer  1991 ,  http:   www.mactech.com articles develop issue_07 Ortiz_Text.html   166   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  default  platform  with  other  media  such  as  video  attached  to  or  directly inserted into this space.   “Multimedia” was an important term when interactive cultural  applications, which featured a few media types, started to appear in  large numbers in the early 1990s. The development of these applica- tions was facilitated by the introduction of the appropriate storage  media, i.e. recordable CD-ROMs in 1991, computer architectures  and  file  formats  designed  to  support  multiple  media  file  formats   Apple’s  QuickTime,  1991–   and  multimedia  authoring  software   the  first  version  of  the  VideoWorks  software  which  later  was  renamed Macromedia Director was released in 1985 . By the middle  of the 1990s digital art exhibitions featured a variety of multimedia  projects; digital art curricula began to offer courses in “multimedia  narrative”; and art museums such as the Louvre started to publish  multimedia  CD-ROMs  offering  tours  of  their  collections.  In  the  second part of the decade multimedia took over the Web as more  and more websites began to incorporate different types of media.  By the end of the decade, “multimedia” became the default in inter- active computer applications. Multimedia CD-ROMs, multimedia  websites,  interactive  kiosks,  and  multimedia  communication  via  mobile devices became so commonplace and taken for granted that  the term lost its relevance. So while today we daily encounter and  use  computer  multimedia,  we  no  longer  wonder  at  the  amazing  ability  of  computers  and  computer-enabled  consumer  electronics  devices to show multiple media types at once.    Seen from the point of view of media history, “computer multi- media”  is  certainly  a  development  of  fundamental  importance.  Previously  “multimedia  documents”  combining  multiple  media  types—such  as  medieval  illustrated  manuscripts,  sacred  archi- tecture,  or  twentieth-century  cinema  and  television—were  not  interactive  in the sense of particular affordances provided by inter- active  computers,  rather  than  other  interactive  technologies  such  as paper books  or networked. But co-existence of multiple media  types within a single document or an application is only one of the  new developments enabled by simulation of many media types in  a computer. In putting forward the term hybrid media I want to  draw attention to another, equally fundamental development that,  in contrast to multimedia, so far has not received a formal name.    Certainly, it is possible to conceive of multimedia as a particular  case  of  hybrid  media.  However,  I  prefer  to  think  of  them  as       HybRIDIzATION    167  overlapping but ultimately two different developments. While some  classical  multimedia  applications  of  the  1990s  would  qualify  as  media hybrids, most will not. Conversely, although media hybrids  often  feature  content  in  different  media,  this  is  only  one  aspect  of  their  make-up.  So  what  is  the  difference  between  the  two?  In  multimedia documents and interactive applications, content types  in multiple media appear next to each other. In a web page, images  and video appear next to text; a blog post may similarly show text,  followed by images and more text; a 3D world may contain a flat  screen object used to display video. Alternatively, each element of  a multimedia message opens in its own viewer  this was the case  for MMS implementations in the phones of the 2000s . In contrast,  in  media  hybrids,  interfaces,  techniques,  and  ultimately  the  most  fundamental assumptions of different media forms and traditions,  are brought together resulting in new media gestalts. That is, they  merge together to offer a coherent new experience different from  experiencing all the elements separately.    Another way to underline this difference is by using the metaphor  of sexual reproduction. The result of sexual reproduction is new  individuals  that  combine  the  genetic  material  of  their  parents— rather than just mechanical assemblages of parents’ physical parts   which would be analogous to multimedia . Using this metaphor,  we can say that new media offspring similarly combine the DNA  of their media parents.    A  related  model  that  can  help  us  to  grasp  some  aspects  of  this  process  is  that  of  biological  evolution.  This  process  results  in  new  organisms,  new  species,  and  also  new  building  blocks  of  the  organisms   molecules  such  as  DNA  and  proteins.   Similarly,  sometimes new media offspring are only slightly different from the  ones that already exist; at other times the combinations of software  DNA produce distinct new media “species.” The process of media  evolution  also  produces  new  techniques  for  media  authoring,  editing, sharing, and collaborating, new interface conventions, and  also new algorithms—the equivalents of the new building blocks of  biological evolution.    Yet another metaphor that can help us to understand the new  stage  of  the  media  development  is  remix.  In  the  process  of  the  computer  metamedium  development,  different  media  types  get  remixed together, forming new combinations. Parts of these combi- nations enter into new remixes, ad infinitum.    168   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND    Every  metaphor  highlights  some  aspects  of  a  phenomenon  while  hiding  or  even  distorting  other  aspects.  The  metaphors  of  sexual reproduction, biological evolution, and music remix work  similarly. Each has advantages and disadvantages in explaining the  second stage of computational media development. In this chapter,  I  will  extensively  use  the  concepts  of  hybridity  and  evolution  to  describe the new stage in media evolution. The chapter in Part 3  will work with the remix metaphor.   Since  I  will  be  invoking  each  of  these  metaphors  in  different  parts  of  my  narrative,  you  may  get  the  impression  that  they  are  complementary  parts  of  the  same  description.  But  this  is  not  the  case for hybridity and biological evolution meataphors. Besides the  everyday  meaning  of  “hybridity,”  it  is  also  used  in  evolutionary  theory in a particular way. So if we think of hybridity in that sense,  we cannot use this concept and the biological evolution model at  the same time.    Contemporary  theories  of  biological  evolution  share  a  basic  definition  of  species  as  a  pool  of  organisms  that  can  enter  into  sexual  relations  between  themselves  but  not  with  other  species.  Through  the  processes  of  evolution  most  often  predicated  on  geographical separation between groups of the same species, these  groups  change  and  eventually  no  longer  can  have  reproductive  relations with one another. Such groups become new species. In  contrast,  an  animal  hybrid  is  the  result  of  interbreeding    between species. Most hybrids are produced artificially, although  a few have been observed in nature.7 Thus, hybrids are exceptions  in the normal evolutionary process. Therefore, when I use the term  “hybrid,”  I  am  relying  on  a  more  general  meaning  of  this  word  outside of biology.   I  also  need  to  make  a  note  about  my  use  of  the  biological  evolution  model.  I  am  not  suggesting  that  computational  media   or  techno-cultural  development  in  general   indeed  “evolve”  like  biological mechanisms, and that the mechanisms of such evolution  are the same as the mechanisms of biological evolution as formu- lated in contemporary biology.  In his 2007 book Graphs, Maps,  Trees:  Abstract  Models  for  Literary  History,  Franco  Moretti  provides  convincing  explanations  of  why  some  of  the  key  ideas     7 M.  L.  Arnold.  Natural  Hybridization  and  Evolution   New  York:  Oxford  University Press, 1996 .       HybRIDIzATION    169  of  biological  evolution  do  not  fit  the  cultural  history.8   Instead,  I  want  to  use  evolutionary  theory  as  a  rich  conceptual  toolbox,  which  can  help  us  to  think  about  any  kind  of  temporal  process.  Understood in this way, evolutionary theory joins other theories of  development that aim to explain physical, social, or psychological  processes—each  providing  its  own  unique  concepts  which  give  us  additional  ways  to  conceptualize  any  development.  Examples  include Marx’s theory of social development with its concepts of  mode of production, base, superstructure, and so on; Freud’s theory  of “the dream work” as formulated in his 1899 Interpretation of  Dreams   concepts  of  condensation  and  displacement ;  complex  systems theory  concepts of emergence and self-organization ; the  phase change model from thermodynamics; and many others.   Having  explained  how  I  will  use  the  concepts  of  hybridity  and  evolution,  I  will  now  go  forward  with  my  arguments.  As  I  see  it,  media  hybridity  is  a  more  fundamental  reconfiguration  of  media universe than multimedia. In both cases we see a “coming  together” of multiple media types. However, multimedia does not  threaten  the  autonomy  of  different  media.  They  retain  their  own  languages,  i.e.  ways  of  organizing  media  data  and  accessing  and  modifying  this  data.  The  typical  use  of  multiple  media  on  the  Web or in PowerPoint presentations illustrates this well. Imagine  a typical web page from the 2000s that consists of text and video  clips  embedded  somewhere  on  the  page.  Both  text  and  video  remain separate on every level. Their media languages do not spill  into  each  other.  Each  media  type  continues  to  offer  us  its  own  interface. With text, we can scroll up and down and zoom using  the browser controls; we can change the browsing settings so it is  displayed in a different font. With video, we can use its interface to  play it, pause or rewind it, loop a part, and change sound volume.  In this example, different media are positioned next to each other  but their interfaces and techniques do not interact. This, for me, is  a typical example of multimedia.    In contrast, in hybrid media the languages of previously distinct  media come together. They exchange properties, create new struc- tures,  and  interact  on  the  deepest  levels.  For  instance,  in  motion  graphics  text  takes  on  many  properties  which  were  previously     8 Franco  Moretti,  Graphs,  Maps,  Trees:  Abstract  Models  for  Literary  History   London Verso, 2007 .   170   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  unique to cinema, animation, or graphic design. To put this differ- ently, while retaining its old typographic dimensions of font family,  size, or line spacing, text also acquires new expressive possibilities  from cinema and computer animation. As a word moves closer to  us,  it  can  appear  out  of  focus—as  though  it  is  a  physical  object  shot by a twentieth-century film camera lens. At the same time, it  can  now  fly  in  a  virtual  space,  performing  physically  impossible  moves—as any other 3D computer graphics object. Its proportions  change  depending  on  what  virtual  lens  the  designer  has  selected.  The individual letters that make up a text string can be exploded  into  many  small  particles;  and  so  on.  In  short,  in  the  process  of  hybridization,  the  language  of  typography  does  not  stay  as  it  is.  Instead  we  end  up  with  a  new  metalanguage  that  combines  the  techniques  of  all  previously  distinct  languages,  including  that  of  typography.   Another  way  to  distinguish  between  “multimedia”  and  “hybrid  media” is by noting whether or not the original structure of media  data  is  affected  when  different  media  types  are  combined.  For  example, when video appears in multimedia documents such as MMS  messages,  emails  sent  in  HTML  format,  web  pages,  or  PowerPoint  presentations,  the  structure  of  video  data  does  not  change  in  any  way.  Just  as  with  twentieth-century  film  and  video  technology,  a  digital video file is a sequence of individual frames, which have the  same  size  and  proportions.  Accordingly,  the  standard  methods  for  interacting  with  this  data  type  also  do  not  challenge  our  idea  of  what “video” is. Like with VCR media players of the 1980–1990s,  when the user selects “play,” the frames quickly replace each other  producing the effect of motion. Video, in short, remains video.   This is typical of multimedia. An example of how some media  structure can be reconfigured—the capacity that I take as one of the  identifying features of media hybrids—is provided by The Invisible  Shape of Things Past, a well-known digital cultural heritage project  about  Berlin’s  history  developed  by  Joachim  Sauter  and  Dirk  Lüsebrink from the media company Art+Com between 1995 and  2007.9 In this project, film clips become solid objects positioned in  a virtual 3D space. Each “film object” is made from individual film  frames situated behind one another to form a 3D stack. The angles     9  http:  www.artcom.de en projects project detail the-invisible-shape-of-things-past       HybRIDIzATION    171  between frames and the sizes of individual frames are determined  by the parameters of the camera that originally shot the film. We  can interact with these new “film objects” as with any other objects  in 3D space, flying around using virtual camera controls.    At  the  same  time  it  is  still  possible  to  “see  the  movie,”  using  the frame stack as a video player. But this operation of access has  been rethought. When a user clicks on the front frame in a stack,  the subsequent frames positioned behind one another are quickly  deleted. You simultaneously see the illusion of movement as in the  twentieth century, and the virtual 3D object shrinking at the same  time.    In  this  example  of  media  restructuring,  which  characterizes  media hybridity, the elements that make up the original film’s “data  structure”—individual frames—have been placed in a new configu- ration. The old structure has been remapped into a new structure.  This new structure retains the original data and their relationship— that is, individual film frames are still organized into a sequence.  But it also has new dimensions—size of frames and their angles. The  new structure also enables a new type of interface for movie access,  which combines virtual space attributes and cinema attributes.    I  hope  that  this  discussion  makes  it  clear  why  hybrid  media  is  not  multimedia,  and  why  we  need  this  new  term.  The  term  “multimedia”  captured  the  phenomenon  the  content  of  different  media  coming  together—but  not  their  languages.  Similarly,  we  cannot use another term that has been frequently used in discus- sions  of  computational  media—“convergence.”  The  dictionary  meanings of “convergence” include “to reach the same point” and  “to become gradually less different and eventually the same.” But  this is not what happens with media languages as they hybridize.  Instead, they acquire new properties—becoming richer as a result.  For  instance,  in  motion  graphics,  text  acquires  the  properties  of  computer  animation  and  cinematography.  In  3D  computer  graphics,  rendering  of  3D  objects  can  use  the  techniques  of  traditional  painting.  In  virtual  globes  such  as  Google  Earth  and  Microsoft  Virtual  Earth,  representational  possibilities  and  inter- faces for working with maps, satellite imagery, 3D buildings, and  photographs are combined to create new richer hybrid representa- tions and new richer interfaces.   In  short,  “softwarization”  of  old  media  did  not  lead  to  their  “convergence.”  Instead,  after  representational  formats  of  older    172   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  The Invisible Shape of Things Past.

This,  for  me,  is  the  essence  of  the  new  stage  of  computer  metamedium development. The unique properties and techniques  of  different  media  have  become  software  elements  that  can  be  combined together in previously impossible ways.    Consequently,  if  in  1977  Kay  and  Goldberg  speculated  that  the  new  computer  metamedium  would  contain  “a  wide  range  of  already existing and not-yet-invented media,” we can now describe  one of the key mechanisms responsible for the invention of these  new media. This mechanism is hybridization. The techniques and  representational formats of previous physical and electronic media  forms,  and  the  new  information  manipulation  techniques  and  data  formats  unique  to  a  computer  are  brought  together  in  new  combinations.    In  retrospect,  it  is  perhaps  not  accidental  that  the  publication  of Kay and Goldberg’s 1977 text, which, for me, summarizes the  achievements of the first stage of computational media invention,  is  directly  followed  by  a  seminal  project  which  opens  up  the  next  stage—that  of  hybridization  of  different  media  simulated  in  software.  In  1978–9  a  group  of  young  researchers  at  the  Architecture  Machine  Group  at  MIT   a  pre-cursor  to  the  MIT  MediaLab   directed  by  Nicholas  Negroponte,  constructed  Aspen  Movie Map—a new type of interactive application that combined a  number of media types: video clips, maps, graphics, and diagrams.  These different media types were connected through a new type of  hypermedia interface. The name of the application—Aspen Movie  Map—underscored  that  this  application  was  neither  a  map  nor  a  movie  but  a  new  hybrid  between  the  two.  The  project  opens  the new fundamental stage in the media evolution enabled by its  “softwarization”—the stage of hybridity.  The evolution of a computer metamedium  I will continue exploring the metaphor of biological evolution. As  the title of Darwin’s On the Origin of Species  1859  makes clear,       HybRIDIzATION    177  the key goal of his evolutionary theory was to explain how different  species develop. Darwin proposed that the underlying mechanism  was that of natural selection. In the twentieth century, biologists  added  a  number  of  other  explanations   genetic  drift,  mutation,  etc.10 . While the mechanisms responsible for the development of  the computer metamedium are certainly different, we can use the  basic ideas of evolutionary theory—emergence of new species over  time, with a gradual increase in their number. But even if we only  take  these  basic  ideas,  there  are  important  differences  between  biological and media evolution.   For example, if we compare the computer metamedium’s devel- opment  to  a  biological  evolution,  we  can  think  of  particularly  novel combination of media types as new species. 11 In biological  evolution,  the  emergence  of  new  species  is  a  very  slow  and  gradual process, which requires many generations.12 Small genetic  changes accumulate over long periods before new species emerge.  However,  new  “media  species”  can  emerge  overnight—it  only  requires  a  novel  idea  and  some  programming.  Given  that  today  a  programmer designer  can  use  multiple  software  libraries  for  media manipulation, and also specialized high-level programming  languages specifically designed for rapid testing of ideas and experi- mentation   Pure  Data,  Processing,  etc. ,  a  talented  person  can  invent new species of media in a few hours.  In  evolutionary  biology,  species  are  defined  as  groups  of    organisms. In media evolution, things work differently. Some novel  combinations of media types may appear only once or twice. For  instance,  a  computer  science  paper  may  propose  a  new  interface  design; a designer may create a unique combination for a particular  design  project;  a  film  may  combine  media  techniques  in  a  novel   10 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki EvolutionMechanisms  February 6, 2012 . 11 I  am  aware  that  not  only  the  details,  but  also  even  most  of  the  fundamental  assumptions underlying evolution theory continue to be actively debated by scien- tists. In my references to evolution, I use what I take to be a few commonly accepted  ideas from evolutionary theory. While these ideas are being periodically contested  and eventually may be disproved, at present they form part of the public “common  sense”: a set of widely held ideas and concepts about the world.  12 “Natural  selection  is  the  gradual,  nonrandom  process  by  which  biological  traits become either more or less common in a population as a function of differ- ential  reproduction  of  their  bearers.  It  is  a  key  mechanism  of  evolution.”  http:   en.wikipedia.org wiki Natural_selection  February 7, 2012 .   178   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  way.  Imagine  that  in  each  case,  a  new  hybrid  is  never  replicated  again. This happens quite often.    Thus,  some  media  combinations  that  emerge  in  the  course  of  media  evolution  will  not  be  “selected.”  Other  combinations,  on  the  other  hand,  may  survive  and  will  successfully  “replicate.”   Again,  remember  that  I  am  evoking  the  biological  model  only  as a metaphor, and that no claims are being made that the actual  mechanisms  of  media  evolution  are  similar  to  the  mechanisms  of  biological  evolution.   Eventually  such  successful  hybrids  may  become the common conventions in media design; built-in features  of  media  authoring  applications;  commonly  used  features  in  social  media  sites;  widely  used  design  patterns;  and  so  on.  In  other  words,  they  may  become  new  basic  building  blocks  of  the  computer  metamedium  that  can  now  be  combined  with  other  blocks.   An example of such a successful combination of media “genes”  is  an  “image  map”  technique  for  web  design.  This  technique  emerged  in  the  middle  of  the  1990s  and  was  quickly  adopted  in  numerous  interactive  media  projects,  games,  and  websites.  How  does  it  work?  A  photograph,  a  drawing,  a  color  background,  or  any  other  part  of  a  screen  is  divided  into  a  few  invisible  parts.  When a user clicks inside one of the parts, this activates a hyperlink  connected to this part.    As a hybrid, an “image map” combines the technique of hyper- linking with all the techniques for creating and editing still images.  Previously, hyperlinks were only attached to a word or a phrase of  text and they were usually explicitly marked in some way to make  them  visible   typically  by  underlining .  When  designers  started  attaching hyperlinks to parts of continuous images or other parts  of a web page without explicitly showing them, a new “species” of  media was born.    As a new species, it defines new kinds of user behavior and it  generates a new experience of media. Rather than being immedi- ately  presented  with  clearly  marked,  ready  to  be  acted  upon  hyperlinks,  a  user  now  has  to  explore  the  screen,  mousing  over  and  clicking  until  s he  comes  across  a  hyperlinked  part.  Rather  than  thinking  of  hyperlinks  as  discrete  locations  inside  a  “dead”  screen, a user comes to think of the whole screen as a live inter- active  surface.  On  an  experiential  level,  rather  than  imagining  a  hyperlink  as  something  which  is  either  present  or  absent,  a  user       HybRIDIzATION    179  may now experience it as a continuous dimension, with some parts  of a surface being “more” strongly hyperlinked than others.    Another example of a successful hybrid that survived and repli- cated in the course of recent media evolution is a virtual camera  model  used  in  3D  computer  animation.  Developed  in  the  1980s  for  creating  computer  animation  sequences  for  feature  films,  a  virtual camera model has gradually become one of the most widely  used  elements  of  digital  media  deployed  in  video  games,  virtual  environments, program interfaces, feature films, motion graphics,  etc.13   As we will see in detail in the next part of the book, the new  language  of  visual  design   a  category  which  includes  graphic  design,  web  design,  interface  design,  motion  graphics,  and  other  design  areas   that  emerged  in  the  second  part  of  the  1990s  offers  a  particularly  striking  example  of  media  hybridization.  Working  with  software  applications,  a  designer  can  combine  any  of  the  techniques  of  graphic  design,  typography,  painting,  cinematography, animation, computer animation, vector drawing,  and  3D  modeling.  At  the  same  time,  s he  also  can  use  many  algorithmic techniques for generating new images and forms  such  as particle systems or procedural modeling  and transforming them   for  instance,  by  using  filters  and  other  digital  image  processing  techniques,  which  do  not  have  direct  equivalents  in  previous  physical,  mechanical  or  electronic  media .  All  these  techniques  are  easily  available  within  a  small  number  of  media  authoring  programs   Photoshop,  Illustrator,  Flash,  Maya,  Final  Cut,  After  Effects,  various  HTML  editors,  etc.   and  they  can  be  easily  combined within a single design.    The  result  is  the  new  design  language  used  today  in  a  large  number of countries around the world. The new “global aesthetics”  celebrates  media  hybridity  and  uses  it  to  engineer  emotional  reactions, drive narratives, and shape user experiences. The ability  to combine previously incompatible techniques of different media  is the single common feature of millions of designs being created  yearly by professionals and students alike, seen on the web and in  print, on big and small screens, in built environments, and all other  platforms.  13 For the analysis of a virtual camera use, see Mike Jones, “Vanishing Point: Spatial  Composition and the Virtual Camera,” Animation 3, no. 2  2007 : pp. 225–43.    180   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND    Like the post-modernism of the 1980s and the web revolution  of  the  1990s,  the  “softwarization”  of  media   the  transfer  of  techniques and interfaces of all previously existing media technol- ogies  to  software   has  flattened  history—in  this  case,  the  history  of  modern  media.  That  is,  while  the  historical  origins  of  all  the  building  blocks  that  make  up  the  computer  metamedium—or  a  particular hybrid—may still be important in some cases, these are  now exceptions rather than the rule. Clearly, for a media historian  such as myself, the historical origins of all techniques now available  in media authoring software do matter. They may also matter for  the  people  encountering  a  particular  media  design—but  only  if  a  designer  chooses  to  foreground  this.  For  instance,  in  the  logo  sequence for DC Comics  Imaginary Forces, 2005  designers used  exaggerated artifacts of print and film to evoke particular historical  periods in the twentieth century. But when we consider the actual  process  of  media  design—the  ways  in  which  designers  work  to  go  from  a  sketch  or  a  storyboard  or  an  idea  in  their  head  to  a  finished product—these historical origins no longer matter. When  a designer opens his her computer and starts working, it does not  matter  whether  the  technique  was  originally  developed  as  a  part  of  the  simulation  of  physical  or  electronic  media.  Thus,  digital  paint brushes, filters simulating various natural textures, a camera  pan, an aerial perspective, splines, and polygonal meshes, blur and  sharpen filters, particle systems, etc.—all have equal status as the  building blocks for new hybrids.   Thirty years after Kay and Goldberg predicted that the new  computer metamedium would contain “a wide range of already  existing and not-yet-invented media,” we can see clearly that their  prediction  was  correct.  The  computer  metamedium  has  indeed  been  systematically  expanding.  However,  as  we  now  can  see,  this expansion should not be understood as the simple addition  of  more  and  more  new  “mediums.”  While  a  number  of  new  software mediums have been invented in the fifty years following  Sketchpad, their number is probably less than one dozen. The key  process in the evolution of the computer metamedium involves  innovation  on  a  more  local  level—the  previous  media  types  simulated in software  text, sound, drawing, etc. , the techniques  for  their  manipulation,  and  new  computer-native  techniques  entering in new combinations, creating a much larger number of  new “species.”       HybRIDIzATION    181    To  restate  this:  following  the  first  stage  where  most  already  existing media were simulated in software and a number of new  computer  techniques  for  generating  and  editing  of  media  were  invented—the  stage  that  conceptually  and  practically  has  been  largely  completed  by  the  late  1970s—we  entered  a  new  period  governed by hybridization. The already simulated mediums started  exchanging  properties  and  techniques.  As  a  result,  the  computer  metamedium  came  to  contain  endless  new  species.  In  parallel,  we  do  indeed  see  a  continuous  process  of  the  invention  of  the  new—but what are being invented are not whole new media types  but  rather  new  elements   new  techniques  for  creating,  modifying  and sharing media data . As soon as they are invented, these new  elements  start  to  interact  with  other,  already  existing  elements.  Thus,  the  processes  of  invention  and  hybridization  are  closely  linked and work together.   This,  in  my  view,  is  the  key  mechanism  responsible  for  the  evolution  and  expansion  of  the  computer  metamedium  from  the  late  1980s  until  now—and  I  do  not  see  any  reason  why  this  mechanism would become less important in the future. And while  at the time when Kay and Goldberg were writing their article the  process  of  hybridization  was  just  barely  starting—the  first  truly  significant  media  hybrid  was  Aspen  Movie  Map  project  created  at  MIT’s  Architecture  Machine  Group  in  1978–9—today  it  is  what  media  design  is  all  about.  Thus,  from  the  point  of  view  of  today, the computer metamedium is indeed an umbrella for many  things—but rather than only containing a set of separate mediums,  it also contains a larger set of smaller building blocks that unite to  create hybrids. These building blocks include algorithms for media  creation and editing, data formats, interface metaphors, navigation  techniques, physical interaction techniques, web technologies, and  other element types. Over time, new elements are being invented and  they also become parts of the computer metamedium. Periodically  people figure out new ways in which some of the elements available  can work together, producing new species. Some of these species  may survive. Some may become new conventions, so omnipresent  that they are not perceived anymore as combinations of elements  which  can  be  taken  apart.  Still  others  are  forgotten—only  to  be  sometimes reinvented later.    Clearly, all the building blocks that together form the computer  metamedium  do  not  have  equal  importance  and  equal  “linking”    182   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  possibilities. Some are used more frequently than others, entering  in  many  more  combinations.  The  virtual  3D  camera  model  is  currently  more  widespread  than,  for  example,  techniques  for  rendering  realistic  looking  hair  or  fur.  The  3D  camera  model  is  built  into  every  3D  animation  application  and  consequently  is  used  in  numerous  3D  animations  and  visual  effects  sequences;  it  appears in TV commercials, motion graphics, instructional video,  and feature films; it is a part of the user interface in all 3D video  games; and is also the interface to popular 3D virtual globes such  as  Google  Earth.14  In  contrast,  hair  and  fur  algorithms  may  not  be available in every animation package and their applications are  also  more  limited,  since  only  human  and  animal  characters  can  have hair or fur.    Some  of  the  new  inventions  may  become  so  important  and  influential that it seems no longer appropriate to think of them as  just elements. Instead, they may be more appropriately called new  media platforms—or simply new mediums.    Mobile  media  platforms  which  emerged  in  the  late  2000s— iOS and Android powering both tablets and mobile phones—are  perfect examples here. 3D virtual space, the World Wide Web,  and  geo  media   media  which  includes  GPS  coordinates   are  other examples of such new media platforms popularized in the  1980s,  1990s,  and  2000s,  respectively.  These  media  platforms  fundamentally reconfigure how all other media are understood  and how they can be used. Thus, when we add spatial coordi- nates to media objects  geo media , place these objects within a  single global networked hypertext  the web , or when we start  using  3D  virtual  space  as  a  new  platform  to  design  not  only  buildings  and  industrial  objects  but  also  movies  and  cartoons,  the identity of what we think of as “media” changes in funda- mental ways. In fact, we can even say that these changes have  been as fundamental as the effects of media “softwarization” in  the first place.    But  is  it  true?  There  is  no  easy  way  to  resolve  this  question.  Ultimately, it is a matter of perspective. For instance, the simulation  of  existing  media  in  software  and  the  subsequent  period  of  media hybridization has had a much more substantial impact on   14 For  a  list  of  other  virtual  globe  applications  and  software  toolkits,  see  http:   en.wikipedia.org wiki Virtual_globe  February 7, 2012 .      HybRIDIzATION    183  contemporary visual and spatial aesthetics across all design fields   at least so far  than did the invention of the Web and graphical  web browsers.   If  we  are  interested  in  the  histories  of  visual  communication,  techniques  of  representation,  and  cultural  memory,  I  do  think  that the universal adoption of software throughout global culture  industries  is  at  least  as  importance  as  the  invention  of  print,  photography or cinema. But if we are to focus on the social and  political  aspects  of  contemporary  media  culture  and  ignore  the  questions of how media looks and what it can represent—asking  instead about who gets to create and distribute media, how people  understand  themselves  and  the  world  through  media,  and  how  they  create  and  maintain  social  relations—we  may  want  to  put  computer networks  be the Web of the 1990s, social media of the  2000s,  and  whatever  new  yet-to-be-invented  forms  will  come  in  the future  in the center.    And  yet,  it  is  important  to  remember  that  without  software,  contemporary networks would not exist. Logically and practically,  software lies underneath everything that comes later.    For  example,  if  I  disconnect  my  laptop  from  my  wireless  network right now, I can still continue using most of the applica- tions—including Word to write this sentence. I can also edit images  and video, create a computer animation, design a fully functional  website, and compose blog posts.  Of course by the time you are  reading  this,  Microsoft  may  be  offering  Word  only  as  an  online  service, but some other word processors which run locally should  be still available…     But if somebody disables the software running the network, it  will go dead.15 In other words, without the underlying software  layers The Internet Galaxy  to quote the title of the 2001 book  by  Manuel  Castells16   would  not  be  possible.  And  if  software  was already responsible for the very first ARPANET  Advanced   15 Since the late 2000s, there has been a gradual movement towards offering more  and more functionality in web applications. However, at least today  2013 , unless  I am in Singapore or Tallinn which are completely covered with free Wi-Fi courtesy  of their governments, I never know if I will find a network connection or not, so I  would not want to completely rely on the webware.  16 Manuel Castells, The Internet Galaxy: Reflections on the Internet, Business, and  Society  Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001 .   184   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Research  Projects  Agency  Network   computer  network  which  linked two remote machines on October 29, 1969 at the Network  Measurement  Center  at  UCLA’s  School  of  Engineering  and  Applied  Science  and  Douglas  Engelbart’s  NLS  system  at  SRI  International  in  Menlo  Park,  California,  its  importance  and  variety only increased as networks develop. Thus, a myriad  of  software technologies are what allows for media to exist on the  web  in  the  first  place:  images  and  video  in  web  pages,  blogs,  Facebook and Twitter, media sharing services such as YouTube  and Instagram, aerial photography and 3D buildings in virtual  globes, etc. Similarly, the use of 3D virtual space as a platform for  media design  which will be discussed in detail in the next part   really means using a number of software algorithms that control  the virtual camera, position the objects in space, calculate how  they look in perspective, simulate the spatial diffusion of light on  the surfaces, and so on.   Hybridity: examples  The  examples  of  media  hybrids  are  all  around  us:  they  can  be  found  in  user  interfaces,  web  applications,  mobile  apps,  visual  design, interactive design, visual effects, locative media, interactive  environments, digital art, and other areas of digital culture. Here  are a few examples that I have deliberately drawn from different  areas. Created in 2004 by Stamen Design  San Francisco , Mappr  was one the first popular web mashups.17 It combined a geographic  map and photos from Flickr.18 Using information entered by Flickr  users, the application guessed geographical locations where photos  were  taken  and  displayed  them  on  the  map.   Today  similar  map  interfaces  to  photo  collections  that  use  GPS  data  captured  with  photos  are  available  for  iPhoto,  Instagram,  and  other  photo  services  and  apps.   Since  May  2007,  Google  Maps  has  offered  Street  Views  that  add  panoramic  photo-based  views  of  city  streets  to  other  media  types  already  used  in  Google  Maps.19  A   17 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Web_mashup  February 7, 2012 . 18 http:  stamen.com projects mappr  November 3, 2012 . 19 http:  maps.a9.com  January 27, 2006 .      HybRIDIzATION    185  hybrid between photography and interfaces for space navigation,  Street Views allows users to navigate through a space on a street  level  by  clicking  on  the  arrows  superimposed  on  the  panoramic  photographs.20    Starting in 1991, Japanese media artist Masaki Fujihata created  a series of projects called Field Studies.21 These projects place video  recordings  made  in  particular  places  within  highly  abstracted  3D  virtual  spaces  representing  these  places.  Fujihata  started  to  work on Field Studies a decade before the term “locative media”  made  its  appearance.  As  cameras  with  built-in  GPS  did  not  yet  commercially exist at that time, the artist created a special video  camera which captured geographical coordinates of each interview  location—along  with  the  camera’s  direction  and  angle  while  he  was  video-taping  the  interview,  as  well  as  his  movement  though  space. The artist used this captured information to create a media  interface  which  combined  3D  navigable  space  and  video  in  a  unique way.    For instance, to create the interactive installation Field-Work@ Alsace  2002 ,22 Fujihata recorded a number of video interviews  with the people living in and passing through the area around  the border between France and Germany. The project confronts  us  with  a  black  screen,  with  a  number  of  three-dimensional  white lines showing the artist’s movement through the area as he  was capturing the interviews. As we navigate around the space,  the changing perspective views of these lines suggest the shapes  of  the  Alsace  terrain.  We  also  see  a  number  of  flat  rectangles  that are positioned at points where each interview was recorded.  Each  rectangle  is  situated  at  a  unique  angle  that  corresponded  to the angle of the hand-held video camera during the interview.  When  you  click  on  a  rectangle,  the  corresponding  video  plays  inside. In  my  view,  Alsace  represents  a  particularly  interesting  media    hybrid.  It  fuses  photography   still  images  which  appear  inside  rectangles ,  video  documentary   video  playing  once  a  user  clicks  inside a rectangle , the locative media  the movement trajectories  recorded by GPS  and 3D virtual space. In addition, Alsace uses a   20 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Google_Street_View  July 17, 2008 . 21 www.field-works.net   January 27, 2006 . 22 http:  www.medienkunstnetz.de works field-work   February 11, 2012 .   186   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Field-Work@Alsace by Masaki Fujihata, 2002.      HybRIDIzATION    187  new media technique developed by Fujihata: the recording not just  of the 2D location but also of the 3D orientation of the camera.    The  result  is  a  new  way  to  represent  collective  experiences  using 3D space as an overall coordinate system—rather than, for  instance,  a  narrative  or  a  database.  At  the  same  time,  Fujihata  found  a  simple  and  elegant  way  to  render  the  subjective  and  unique  nature  of  each  video  interview—situating  each  rectangle  at a particular angle that shows where the camera was during the  interview.  Additionally,  by  defining  3D  space  as  an  empty  void  containing  only  trajectories  of  Fujihata’s  movement  through  the  region,  the  artist  introduced  the  additional  dimension  of  subjec- tivity. Even today after Google Earth has made 3D navigation of  space containing photos and video a common experience, Alsace  and other projects by Fujihata continue to stand out. They show  that  to  create  a  new  kind  of  representation  it  is  not  enough  to  simply  “add”  different  media  formats  and  techniques  together.  Rather, it may be necessary to systematically question the conven- tions of different media types to make up a hybrid, changing their  structure in the process.   A  well-known  media  art  project  I  have  already  evoked—The  Invisible Shape of Things Past—also uses 3D space as an umbrella  that contains other media types. As I have already discussed, the  project  maps  historical  film  clips  of  Berlin  recorded  throughout  the  twentieth  century  into  new  spatial  forms  that  are  integrated  into  a  3D  navigable  reconstruction  of  the  city.23  The  forms  are  constructed by placing subsequent film frames behind each other.  In addition to being able to move around the space and play the  films, the user can mix and match parts of Berlin by choosing from  a  number  of  maps  which  represent  city  development  in  different  periods  of  the  twentieth  century.  Like  Alsace,  Invisible  Shape  recombines a number of common media types while changing their  structure. A video clip becomes a 3D object with a unique shape.  Rather  than  representing  a  territory  as  it  existed  in  a  particular  time, a map can mix parts of the city as they existed at different  times.    Another  pioneering  media  hybrid  created  by  Sauter  and  his  company  Art+Com  is  Interactive  Generative  Stage   2002 —a   23 See www.artcom.de   188   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  virtual set whose parameters are interactively controlled by actors  during  the  opera.24  During  the  opera  performance,  the  computer  reads the body movements and gestures of the actors and uses this  information  to  control  the  generation  of  a  virtual  set  projected  on a screen behind the stage. The positions of a human body are  mapped into various parameters of a virtual architecture such as  the layout, texture, color, and light.    Sauter felt that it was important to preserve the constraints of  the  traditional  opera  format—actors  foregrounded  by  lighting  with  the  set  behind  them—while  carefully  adding  new  dimen- sions to it.25 Therefore, following the conventions of traditional  opera the virtual set appears as a backdrop behind the actors— except  now  it  not  a  static  picture  but  a  dynamic  architectural  construction that changes throughout the opera. As a result, the  identity of a theatrical space changes from that of a backdrop to a  main actor—and a very versatile actor at that—since throughout  the  opera  it  adopts  different  personalities  and  continues  to  surprise the audience with new behaviors. This kind of funda- mental redefinition of an element making a new hybrid is rare,  but  when  a  designer  is  able  to  achieve  this,  the  result  is  very  powerful.   Not every hybrid is necessarily elegant, convincing, or forward- looking. Some of the interfaces of popular media creation and access  applications look like the work of an aspiring DJ, mixing opera- tions from old interfaces of various media with new GUI principles  in sometimes erratic and unpredictable ways. In my view, a striking  example  of  such  a  problematic  hybrid  is  the  interface  of  Adobe  Acrobat version 8.0, released in November 2006.26  Note that since  the  interfaces  of  all  commercial  software  applications  typically  change from version to version, just as elsewhere in the book, this  example refers to this particular version of Adobe Acrobat.  This  version of Acrobat’s User Interface combines interface metaphors  from a variety of media traditions and technologies in a way that,  at least to me, does not always seem to be logical. Within a single  interface,  we  get  1   the  interface  elements  from  analog  media   24 The full name of the project is Interactive generative stage and dynamic costume  for André Werner’s opera, ‘Marlowe, the Jew of Malta.’  25 Joachim Sauter, personal communication, Berlin, July 2002. 26 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Adobe_AcrobatVersion_8.0  February 8, 2012 .      HybRIDIzATION    189  recorders players  of  the  twentieth  century,  e.g.,  VCR-style  arrow  buttons;  2   interface  elements  from  image  editing  software,  e.g.,  a zoom tool; 3  interface elements which have strong association  with  the  print  tradition—although  they  never  existed  in  print   page icons also controlling the zoom factor ;  4  elements which  have existed in books  the bookmarks window ;  5  the standard  elements  of  a  GUI  such  as  search,  filter,  and  multiple  windows.  It seems that Acrobat designers wanted to give users a variety of  ways  to  navigate  through  documents.  However,  I  find  the  use  of  so many navigation metaphors confusing. For instance, given that  Acrobat  was  designed  to  closely  simulate  the  experience  of  print  documents, it is not clear to me why I am asked to move through  the  pages  by  clicking  on  the  forward  and  backward  arrows—an  interface  convention  which  is  normally  used  for  moving  image  media.   The  hybrids  do  not  necessarily  have  to  involve  a  “deep”  reconfiguration  of  previously  separate  media  languages  and or  the  common  structures  of  media  objects—the  way,  for  example,  The  Invisible Shape reconfigures the structure of a film object. Consider  web mashups which “combine data elements from multiple sources,  hiding  this  behind  a  simple  unified  graphical  interface.27  I  have  already  used  one  example  of  a  Web  mashup—Mappr.  Here  are  some other successful early examples. Flickrvision 3D  David Troy,  2007   used  data  provided  by  Flickr  and  the  virtual  globe  from  Poly  9  FreeEarth  to  create  a  mashup  which  continually  showed  the  new  photos  uploaded  to  Flickr  attached  to  the  virtual  globe  at  those  locations  where  the  photos  were  taken.  Another  mashup  called Liveplasma  2005  used Amazon services and data to offer a  music and discovery engine. When a user selected an actor, a movie  director,  a  movie  title,  or  a  band  name,  Liveplasma  generated  an  interactive  map  that  showed  related  actors,  movie  directors,  etc.  using  various  dimensions  such  as  style,  influences,  popularity,  and  others.28  Although  Liveplasma  suggests  that  the  purpose  of  these  maps  is  to  lead  you  to  discover  the  items  that  you  are  also  likely  to  like   so  you  purchase  them  on  amazon.com ,  these  maps  are  valuable in themselves. They employ newly available rich data about  people’s cultural preferences and behavior collected by Web 2.0 sites   27 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Mashup_ web_application_hybrid   July 19, 2008 . 28 http:  www.liveplasma.com   August 16, 2008 .   190   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  such  as  Amazon  to  do  something  that  was  not  possible  until  the  2000s. That is, rather than mapping cultural relationships based on  the ideas of a single person or a group of experts, they reveal how  these  relationships  are  understood  by  actual  cultural  consumers.    The development of mashups is supported by the gradually growing  number of web APIs offered by a variety of companies. An API provides  an easy way for a programmer to create new programs, which use  services or data provided by web companies. For example, you can use  the Google Maps API to generate interactive Google maps inside your  website. When a user comes to the site and enters an address into the  map interface, Google servers get the request and send back the new  map. When I checked the mashup tracker programmableweb.com on  February 8, 2012, it listed 2,337 mashups that use the Google Maps  API.29 Many mashups combine between half a dozen and a dozen APIs  from different services. By September 2012, the site tracked over 7,000  different APIs.30 Sorted by the number of mashups using these APIs,  the top entries were the Google Maps API used in 2,416 mashups,  the  Twitter  API  used  in  717  mashups,  and  YouTube,  used  in  650  mashups.31 These numbers may only represent a small percentage of  all mashups out there—just think about all the times you encounter a  Google map used as part of some website or service. According to one  2012 estimate, the Google Maps API was used in 350,000 web sites.  Thus, the numbers reported by programmableweb.com perhaps only  indicate the relative proportions in APIs use in mashups.   Visually, many mashups may appear as typical multimedia web  pages—but  they  are  more  than  that.  As  the  Wikipedia  article  on  “mashup  web application hybrid ” explains, “A site that allows a  user to embed a YouTube video for instance, is not a mashup site…  the site should itself access 3rd party data using an API, and process  that data in some way to increase its value to the site’s users.”  My  emphasis . Although the terms used by the authors—processing data  to increase its value—may appear to be strictly business-like, they  also capture the difference between multimedia and hybrid media   29 http:  www.programmableweb.com apis directory 1?sort=mashups   February  8,  2012 . 30 http:  blog.programmableweb.com 2012 08 23 7000-apis-twice-as-many-as-this- time-last-year   August 23, 2012 . 31 http:  www.programmableweb.com apis directory 1?sort=mashups   November  4,  2012 .      HybRIDIzATION    191  in a theoretically accurate way. Paraphrasing the article’s authors,  we can say that in the case of successful artistic hybrids such as The  Invisible Shape or Alsace, separate representational formats  video,  photography,  2D  map,  3D  virtual  globe   and  media  navigation  techniques  playing a video, zooming into a 2D document, moving  around a space using a virtual camera  are brought together in ways  which increase the representational and expressive value offered by  each media type used. However, in contrast to the web mashups  that  started  to  appear  en  masse  in  2006  when  Amazon,  Flickr,  Google  and  other  major  web  companies  offered  public  API   i.e.,  they made it possible for others to use their services and some of  their data—for instance, using Flickr images as a part of a mashup ,  these projects also used their own data, which the artists carefully  selected or created themselves. As a result, the artists have much  more control over the aesthetic experience and the “personality”  projected by their works than an author of a mashup, which relies  on both data and the interfaces provided by other companies and  non-profit organizations such as OpenLayers.    I am not trying to criticize the web mashup technology—I only  want to suggest that if the project’s goal is to put forward a different  representational model and a unique aesthetic experience, choosing  from  the  same  set  of  web  sources  and  data  sources  available  to  everybody  else  may  be  not  the  right  solution.  And  the  argument  that web mashup author acts as a DJ who creates by mixing what  already exists also does not work here—since a DJ has both more  control  over  the  parameters  of  the  mix,  and  more  recordings  to  choose from.   In  discussing  examples  of  hybrids  so  far  I  have  implicitly  presented them as combinations and reconfigurations of previously  existing  media,  which  include  both  the  simulations  of  physical  media such as print and new media such as computer animation. In  other words, I have relied on the notion consistent with Kay’s own  formulation that the computer mediamedium can be understood as  a collection of different mediums. For example, I talked about how  Alsace combined photography and video documentary  pre-digital  media simulated in a computer  with locative data and 3D virtual  space  new computer media .    However, we can also think of media hybridity using a different  conceptualization of the metamedium. That is, rather than empha- sizing “whole” media we can focus on their building blocks—i.e.,    192   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  different types of media data  or “media content”  and two types  of  techniques  which  can  operate  on  this  data.   I  called  these  techniques  “media-specific,”  if  they  can  only  work  on  specific  media  types;  I  called  “media-independent”  those  techniques  that  are implemented to work with many types .    From  this  perspective,  the  new  hybrid  media  species—a  single  project,  web  service,  or  a  software  program—represents  the  meeting of various techniques that previously belonged to different  mediums.  Chapter  5  will  develop  this  concept  in  detail  using  examples from motion graphics and design. We will also see how  hybridization as enabled by software became one of the dominant  aesthetics of contemporary media. But as a way of getting started,  let us take the example of hybridization and discuss it in terms of  data types and data manipulation techniques. For this example, I  will use an application which should be familiar to everybody and  which  I  have  already  briefly  evoked  a  number  of  times—Google  Earth.    Google  Earth  is  based  on  an  earlier  application  called  Earth  Viewer  developed  by  Keyhole,  Inc.  This  company  was  acquired  by  Google  in  2004.  In  its  turn,  Earth  Viewer  took  the  idea  of  seamless  interactive  navigation  cinema-style  around  the  detailed  and  hybrid  spatial  representation  from  1996  project  Terravision.  The project was created by the same innovative design team which  is also responsible for some of the other outstanding media hybrids  we  already  encountered—Joachim  Sauter  and  Art+Com.32   The  following  analysis  applies  the  features  and  interfaces  in  Google  Earth  5,  released  in  May  2009.   Using  this  application,  you  can  navigate around the Earth’s surface, zooming in and out; turn on  and off a variety of data overlays; search for places and directions;  mark places on the map and share these additions with all other  users  of  Google  Earth;  import  your  own  information  including  images and GPS data; create movies of touring around; and more.    When  Google  Earth  was  first  released  in  June  2005,  Google  called it a “3D interface to the planet.”33 This description itself tells  us right away that we are not dealing with a twentieth-century map  or any other representation already familiar to users. So what are   32 http:  www.artcom.de 33 http:  windowssecrets.com langalist-plus a-3d-interface-to-the-planet    February  10, 2012 .      HybRIDIzATION    193  the key elements of the experience offered by this “3D interface to  the planet” that make it stand out from the variety of other cultural  applications  that  allow  a  user  to  navigate  around  and  perform  actions  on  some  data—2D  Google  Maps,  web  browsers,  iTunes,  educational  multimedia  applications,  and  so  on?  These  elements  are both its hybrid terrain and the corresponding hybrid navigation  mechanisms.    The representation of Earth’s surface that appears in the main  Google  Map  window,  called  “3D  Viewer,”  combines  satellite  photography, 3D elevation data, 3D models of buildings, and the  graphics elements familiar to us from modern paper maps  vector  graphics  and  text  labels  identifying  roads,  country  boundaries,  etc. . Importantly, the four types of data are “glued together,”  i.e.,  rendered directly on top of each , thus appearing as a single visual  source. This is a perfect example of a hybrid. The different media  types are brought together to create a new representation.    The  3D  interface  offered  by  Google  Earth  is  also  a  hybrid.  It  draws  on  the  new  type  of  computational  media  that  has  been  evolving  since  the  late  1960s:  3D  interactive  navigable  space.  It  also uses the computer simulation of Hollywood cinematography  techniques developed in the 3D computer animation field since the  1970s. The user navigates around the hybrid terrain using a set of  defined camera controls that extend the language of zoom, tilt, and  pan,  developed  in  film  cinematography.   Google  Earth  6  defines  the following “3D navigation techniques”: move left, right, up and  down, rotate clockwise and counter wise, tilt up and down, zoom  in and out, zoom + automatic tilt, look and reset.34    In addition to this basic navigation system, the application also  offers  a  more  explicitly  cinematic  and  more  automatic  method  called  Touring,  where  the  camera  flies  between  the  points  in  a  seamless trajectory.     I  am  distinguishing  between  “3D  interactive  space”  and  “simulated  camera”  for  the  following  reason.  While  software  used by computer animators, game designers, and media designers  provides a virtual camera interface to 3D space with all traditional  cinematographic controls, other applications which also use virtual  spaces such as VR and computer games do not. Instead they use   34 http:  support.google.com earth bin answer.py?hl=en&answer=148115&topic=2 376154&ctx=topic  February 10, 2012 .   194   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  The Layers window in Google Earth 7.0  2012 . The screenshot shows  only some of the hundreds of layers available.      HybRIDIzATION    195  movements of the body, head, or fingers of the human user to guide  a camera. Thus, a 3D space representation and a 3D camera model  do not have to go together.    While  Google  Earth’s  core  data  model   satellite  imagery  +  elevation data + map symbols  remains unchanged over time and  a  number  of  software  releases,  the  continuing  addition  of  new  data sources and data types makes the representation increasingly  rich—and simultaneously increases its hybridity. These additional  types of data include links to web content, Street View  launched  on May 25, 2007 , normal and panoramic hi-res photos, historical  imagery   in  Google  Earth  5.0 ,  underwater  terrain,  the  Moon,  Mars, real-time traffic, etc. The addition of some of these new data  types  requires  parallel  addition  of  new  navigation  mechanisms.  Thus, side-by-side with the original core 3D cinema-like interface  we now find other interfaces. In this way, the techniques for working with data provided by    Google Earth also become more hybrid. When interacting with a  3D building, a user can “swoop to the top or side” of the building.  In  the  case  of  high-res  gigapixel  photos,  Google  Earth  offers  a  special  way  of  “flying  into”  a  photo  which  then  can  be  panned  and zoomed. And with Street View, yet another set of navigation  techniques is provided.35  Strategies of hybridization  As  we  see,  media  hybrids  can  be  structured  in  different  ways.  In  user interfaces such as the interface of Acrobat Reader, the opera- tions  which  previously  belonged  to  specific  physical,  mechanical,  and electronic media are combined to offer the user more ways to  navigate and work with the computer documents  combination of  different  interface  techniques .  Google  Earth  combines  different  types of media to provide more comprehensive information about  places when either media can do by itself  a combination of media   35 “Using  the  keyboard  or  mouse  the  horizontal  and  vertical  viewing  direction  and the zoom level can be selected. A solid or broken line in the photo shows the  approximate path followed by the camera car, and arrows link to the next photo  in each direction. At junctions and crossings of camera car routes, more arrows are  shown.” http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Google_Street_View  February 11, 2012 .   196   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  types . Mappr exemplifies another strategy: using a 2D geo map as  an interface to a media collection—in this case, photos uploaded  on Flickr  using one media type as an interface to another media  type.   Alsace  and  Invisible  Shape  exemplify  yet  another  type  of  media  combination:  using  one  media  type  as  an  enclosure  for  another  media  type   3D  virtual  space  containing  film  and  video  and clips .   A complementary way of categorizing media hybrids is by asking  if a particular hybrid offers new ways of representing the world,  and or new ways of navigating these representations. Hybrids may  combine  and or  reconfigure  familiar  media  formats  and  media  interfaces to offer new types of hybrid representations. For instance,  Google Earth and Microsoft Bing Maps combine different media  types  and  interface  techniques  to  provide  more  comprehensive  information about places than either media can do by itself. The  ambitions behind Alsace and Invisible Shape are different—not to  provide  more  information  by  combining  existing  media  formats  but  rather  to  reconfigure  these  formats  in  order  to  create  new  representations of human collective and individual experiences that  fuse objective and subjective dimensions. But in both cases, we can  say that the overall goal is to represent the world or our experience  in  a  new  way  by  combining  and  possibly  reconfiguring  already  familiar  media  representations   photos,  video,  maps,  3D  objects,  web pages, panoramic photos, etc.  Another good example of such  hybrids  is  Microsoft  Photosynth  which  offers  new  types  of  3D  representations   “synths”   made  by  matching  many  photographs  of the same scenes—such as a detailed model of a 3D Notre Dame  Cathedral created entirely from its photos on Flickr.36    Secondly, the hybrids may focus on new ways of navigation and  interaction  with  already  existing  media  formats.  Here  the  media  type  itself  is  neither  modified  nor  combined  with  other  media— instead,  hybridization  happens  in  the  UI  and  the  tools  provided  by  the  project,  service  or  the  application  for  working  with  this  media  type.  For  example,  in  the  case  of  Mappr,  both  2D  map  and  photo  formats already existed separately. The mashup links them together,  turning the map into an interface to the photos available on Flickr.37   36 http:  www.ted.com talks blaise_aguera_y_arcas_demos_photosynth.html   February 19, 2012 . 37 This  mashup  also  exemplifies  an  important  development  within  metamedia       HybRIDIzATION    197   Flickr itself later offered the similar map interface38 as well as an  application to allow users to place their photos on a world map.39  On February 19, 2012, Flickr’s map interface contained over 175  million geo-tagged photos.     In  summary,  a  hybrid  may  define  new  navigation  and  inter- action techniques that operate over non-modified media formats.  Alternatively,  a  hybrid  may  define  new  media  formats  but  use  already existing interaction interface techniques. A hybrid may also  combine both strategies, i.e. it can define both new interfaces tools  and new media formats at the same time. This, however, requires  a real creativity and deep understanding of both media computing  and  media  aesthetics,  so  such  hybrids  do  not  appear  very  often.   Alsace, Invisible Shape, and Photosynth are able to combine both  strategies, and this is why for me they stand out from the multitude  of  new  media  projects  and  applications  created  in  the  last  two  decades.    You may notice that the distinction between a “representation”   or a “media format”  and an “interface tool” corresponds to the  two fundamental components of all modern software: data struc- tures and algorithms. This is not accidental. Each tool offered by a  media authoring, editing or viewing application corresponds to an  algorithm that either processes the data in a particular format in  some way, or generates new data in this format. For example, let  us assume that our media format is a photo  or, more generally, a  raster image . To generate a gallery view of the photos an algorithm  has to process each photo to fit it into a specified size  this is done  by calculating averages of groups of pixels and using a new smaller  set of these average values . To draw a line over a photo requires  calling another algorithm that calculates new colors for the pixels  beneath  the  line.  Thus,  “working  with  media”  using  application  software  essentially  means  running  different  algorithms  over  the  data.   evolution: a convergence between media and spatial data. The three main forms of  this convergence are: 1  a 2D map used as an interface to other media types  as in  Mappr ; 2  a 3D virtual map used as an interface to other media types  as in Alsace,  Invisible Shapes or Google Earth ; 3  location information automatically added by  a capture device to images and video recordings.  38 http:  www.flickr.com map  39 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki FlickrOrganizr  March 2, 2012 .   198   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND    While  this  logical  differentiation  is  clear  and  useful  for  the  person who understands programming, when we consider the user’s  experience of media authoring viewing cataloging sharing applica- tions, web services, and interactive media projects, it is harder to  maintain.  In  the  world  of  application  software,  media  data  and  interfaces tools  never  exist  in  isolation  from  each  other.  Unless  you  know  how  to  program,  you  never  encounter  media  content  types—digital  photos,  digital  videos,  maps,  etc.—by  themselves.  Instead, you encounter media content through particular software  applications, or the custom interfaces defined by the designers of  a  particular  project.  In  other  words,  you  always  work  with  data  in  a  context  of  some  application,  one  that  comes  with  its  own  interface  and  tools.  This  means  that  as  experienced  by  a  user  of  application software, “representation” consists of two interlinked  parts:  data  structured  in  particular  ways  and  the  interfaces tools  provided to navigate and work with this data.  The same applies  for  the  concept  of  “information”.   For  example,  a  “3D  virtual  space” as it is defined in 3D computer animation and CAD appli- cations,  computer  games,  virtual  globes,  and  other  applications  is  not  only  a  set  of  coordinates  that  make  up  3D  objects  and  a  perspective transformation but also a set of navigation methods— i.e., a virtual camera model. A “photograph” as defined by media  editing  applications  includes  various  editing  operations  that  can  be performed on it such as scale, cut and paste, make mask, add  layers,  etc.  Liveplasma’s  interactive  culture  maps  are  not  only  relationships  between  the  items  on  the  map  that  we  can  see  but  also the tools provided to construct and navigate these maps. And  the unique “Earth” in Google Earth is made up not only from its  hybrid data model  satellite photography, elevation, 2D map, 3D  buildings, panoramas  but also the rich techniques for navigating  and exploring this data.   CHAPTER FOUR  Soft evolution  Algorithms and data structures  What makes possible the hybridization of media creation, editing,  and  navigation  techniques?  To  start  answering  this  question  we  need to ask once again what it means to simulate physical media in  software. For example, what does it mean to simulate photography  or print media?    A  naïve  answer  is  that  computers  simulate  the  actual  media  objects themselves. For example, a digital photograph simulates an  analog photograph printed on paper; a digital illustration simulates  an illustration drawn on paper; and digital video simulates analog  video recorded on videotape. But that is not how things actually  work.   What  software  simulates  are  the  physical,  mechanical,  or  electronic  techniques  used  to  navigate,  create,  edit,  and  interact  with  media  data.   And,  of  course,  software  also  extends  and  augments them, as discussed in detail in Part 1.  For example, the  simulation of print includes the techniques for writing and editing  text   copy,  cut,  paste,  insert ;  the  techniques  for  modifying  the  appearance of this text  change fonts or text color  and the layout  of the document  define margins, insert page numbers, etc. ; and  the techniques for viewing the final document  go to the next page,  view multiple pages, zoom, make bookmark . Similarly, software  simulation of cinema includes all the techniques of cinematography  such  as  user-defined  focus,  the  grammar  of  camera  movements    200   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND   pan,  dolly,  zoom ,  the  particular  lens  that  defines  what  part  of  a virtual scene the camera will see, etc. The simulation of analog  video includes a set of navigation commands: play forward, play in  reverse, fast forward, loop, etc. In short: to simulate a medium in  software means to simulate its tools and interfaces, rather than its  “material.”   Before  their  softwarization,  the  techniques  available  in  a  particular  medium  were  part  of  its  “hardware.”  This  hardware  included instruments for inscribing information on some material,  modifying  this  information,  and—if  the  information  was  not  directly  accessible  to  human  senses  such  as  in  the  case  of  sound  recording—presenting it. Together the material and the instruments  determined what a given medium could do.    For  example,  the  techniques  available  for  writing  were  deter- mined by the properties of paper and writing instruments, such as  a fountain pen or a typewriter.  The paper allows making marks  on top of other marks, the marks can be erased if one uses pencil  but  not  pen,  etc.   The  techniques  of  filmmaking  were  similarly  determined  by  the  properties  of  film  stock  and  the  recording  instrument  i.e. a film camera . Because each medium used its own  distinct  materials  and  physical,  mechanical,  or  electronic  instru- ments,  each  also  developed  its  own  set  of  techniques,  with  little  overlap.    Thus,  because  media  techniques  were  part  of  specific  incom- patible hardware, their hybridization was prevented. For instance,  you could white out a word while typing on a typewriter and type  over—but  you  could  not  do  this  with  the  already  exposed  film.  Or, you could zoom out while filming progressively revealing more  information—but you could not do the same while reading a book   i.e.  you  could  not  instantly  reformat  the  book  to  see  a  whole  chapter  at  once.   A  printed  book  interface  only  allowed  you  to  access information at a constant level of detail—whatever would  fit a two-page spread.1   Software  simulation  liberates  media  creation  and  interaction  techniques  from  their  respective  hardware.  The  techniques  are  translated  into  software,  i.e.  each  becomes  a  separate  algorithm.     1 This  was  one  of  the  conventions  of  books  which  early  twentieth-century  book  experiments  by  modernist  poets,  and  designers  such  as  Marinetti,  Rozanova,  Kruchenykh, Lissitzky, and others worked against.      SOFT  EVOLUTION    201  And  what  about  the  physical  materials  of  different  mediums?  It  may  seem  that  in  the  process  of  simulation  they  are  eliminated.  Instead,  media  algorithms,  like  all  software,  work  on  a  single  material—digital data, i.e. numbers.    However,  the  reality  is  more  complex  and  more  interesting.  The differences between materials of distinct media do not simply  disappear  into  thin  air.  Instead  of  a  variety  of  physical  materials  computational mediums use different ways of coding and storing  information—different data structures. And here comes the crucial  point. In place of a large number of physical materials, software  simulations use a smaller number of data structures.     A  note  on  my  use  of  the  term  “data  structure.”  In  computer  science, a data structure is defined as “a particular way of storing  and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.”2  The examples of data structures are arrays, lists, and trees. I am  going to appropriate this term and use it somewhat differently, to  refer to “higher-level” representations which are central to contem- porary  computational  media:  a  bitmap  image,  a  vector  image,  a  polygonal  3D  model,  NURBS  models,  a  text  file,  HTML,  XML  and a few others. Although the IT, media, and culture industries  revolve around these formats, they do not have a standard name  of  their  own.  For  me  the  term  “representation”  is  too  culturally  loaded while the term “data type” sounds strictly technical. I prefer  “data structure” because it simultaneously has a specific meaning  in  computer  science  and  also  a  meaning  in  humanities—i.e.  the  “structure”  part.  The  term  will  keep  reminding  us  that  what  we  experience as “media,” “content” or “cultural artifact” is techni- cally a set of data organized in a particular way.    Consider  all  different  types  of  materials  that  can  be  used  to  create  2D  images,  from  stone,  parchment  and  canvas  to  all  the  dozens  types  of  paper,  that  one  can  find  today  in  an  art  supply  store. Add to those all of the different kinds of photographic film,  X-Ray film, film stocks, celluloid used for animation, etc. Digital  imaging substitutes all these different materials by employing just  two  data  structures.  The  first  is  the  bitmapped  image—a  grid  of  discrete “picture elements”  i.e., pixels  each having its own color     2 Paul  E.  Black,  ed.,  entry  for  “data  structure”  in  Dictionary  of  Algorithms  and  Data Structures, U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, http:  xlinux. nist.gov dads    202   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  or gray-scale value. The second is the vector image, consisting of  lines and shapes defined by mathematical equations.   So  what  then  happens  to  all  the  different  effects  that  these  physical  materials  were  making  possible?  Drawing  on  rough  paper produces different effects from drawing on smooth paper;  carving  an  image  on  wood  is  different  from  etching  the  same  drawing  in  metal.  With  softwarization,  all  these  effects  are  moved  from  “hardware”   physical  materials  and  tools   into  software.   All algorithms for creating and editing continuous-tone images  work on the same data structure—a grid of pixels. And while they  use different computational steps, the end result of these computa- tions is always the same—a modification in the colors of some of  the pixels. Depending on which pixels are being modified and in  what  fashion,  the  algorithms  can  visually  simulate  the  effects  of  drawing on smooth or rough paper, using oils on canvas, carving  on  wood,  and  making  paintings  and  drawings  using  a  variety  of  physical instruments and materials.   If  particular  medium  effects  were  previously  the  result  of  the  interaction between the properties of the tools and the properties  of  the  material,  now  they  are  the  result  of  different  algorithms  modifying  a  single  data  structure.  So  we  can  first  apply  the  algorithm that acts as a brush on canvas, then an algorithm that  creates an effect of a watercolor brush on rough paper, then a fine  pen  on  a  smooth  paper,  and  so  on.  In  short,  the  techniques  of  previously separate mediums can now be easily combined within  a  single  image.  And  since  media  applications  such  as  Photoshop  offer  dozens  of  these  algorithms   presented  to  the  user  as  tools  and  filters  with  controls  and  options ,  this  theoretical  possibility  becomes a standard practice. The result is a new hybrid medium  that combines the possibilities of many once-separate mediums.   Instead  of  numerous  separate  materials  and  instruments,  we  can now use a single software application whose tools and filters  can simulate different media creation and modification techniques.  The effects that previously could not be combined since they were  tied to unique materials are now available from a single pull-down  menu.  And  when  somebody  invents  a  new  algorithm,  or  a  new  version of already existing algorithm, it can easily be added to this  menu using the plug-in architecture that became standardized in the  1990s  the term “plug-in” was coined in 1987 by the developers of       SOFT  EVOLUTION    203  Digital  Darkroom,  a  photo  editing  application3 .  And,  of  course,  numerous  other  image  creation  and  modification  techniques  that  did  not  exist  previously  can  be  also  added:  image  arithmetic,  algorithmic texture generation  such as Photoshop’s Render Clouds  filter ,  a  variety  of  blur  filters,  and  so  on   Photoshop’s  menus  provide many more examples .   To  summarize  this  analysis:  software  simulation  substitutes  a  variety  of  distinct  materials  and  the  tools  used  to  inscribe  information   i.e.,  make  marks   on  these  materials  with  a  new  hybrid  medium  defined  by  a  common  data  structure.  Because  of  this  common  structure,  multiple  techniques  that  were  previously  unique to different media can now be used together. At the same  time, new previously non-existent techniques can be added as well,  so long as they can operate on the same data structure.     Note:  many  standard  contemporary  image  formats  including  the Photoshop .psd format are much more complex than a simple  pixel grid—they can include alpha channels, multiple layers, and  color profiles; they can also combine bitmapped and vector repre- sentations.  However,  in  this  discussion,  I  am  only  talking  about  their common denominator—what the algorithms work on when  an  image  is  loaded  in  memory—an  array  of  pixels  holding  color  values.    Let  us  now  look  at  another  example  of  what  happens  with  physical  materials  of  different  mediums  when  they  are  simulated  in  software.  Consider  3D  modeling  software  such  as  Blender,  Maya,  3ds  Max  Studio,  LightWave  3D,  or  Google’s  SketchUp.  These  applications  provide  the  techniques  for  defining  3D  forms  which  were  previously  “hardwired”  to  different  physical  media.  For example, you can use sculpting tools to create a rounded form  as though you are using clay. 3D applications also provide dozens  of new techniques for defining and modifying forms not available  previously:  bevel,  extrude,  spherize,  randomize,  boolean  opera- tions, smooth, loft, morph, simplify, subdivide, and so on.4 As with  image  editing  software,  new  techniques  can  always  be  added  as  long as they operate on the standard data structures already used  by  3D  software.   The  most  common  ones  are  polygonal  models     3 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Digital_Darkroom  February 19, 2012    4 A list of a subset of the operations that work on 3D models made from polygons  is provided in http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Polygon_modelingOperations    204   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  and  NURBS  models.5  The  former  consist  of  flat  polygons;  the  latter are defined by smooth curves.  These data structures are the  new “materials” that software substitutes for a variety of physical  materials  used  by  humans  to  create  physical  3D  forms  such  as  stone, wood, clay, or concrete.    These two examples of raster image and 3D model data struc- tures should make clear why it is incorrect to think that computers  always  work  on  a  single  digital  material,  so  to  speak,  i.e.  the  binary code made from 0 and 1. Of course this is what happens  on a low-level machine level—but this is largely irrelevant as far  as application software users and people who write this software  are  concerned.  Contemporary  media  software  contains  its  own  “materials”:  data  structures  used  to  represent  still  and  moving  images, 3D forms, volumes and spaces, texts, sound compositions,  print  designs,  web  pages,  and  other  “cultural  data.”  These  data  structures do not correspond to physical materials in a 1:1 fashion.  Instead, a number of physical materials are mapped onto a single  structure—for instance, different imaging materials such as paper,  canvas,  photographic  film,  and  videotape  become  a  single  data  structure   i.e.,  a  bitmapped  image .  This  many  to  one  mapping  from physical materials to data structures is one of the conditions  which enables hybridization of media techniques.   What is a “medium”?  I  have  spent  considerable  time  analyzing  the  specificity  of  media  software in relation to pre-digital media. This analysis allows us to  better understand why hybridity became the next stage in computer  metamedium  evolution  and  to  begin  tracing  the  mechanisms  of  hybridization.  Let  us  now  see  if  we  can  use  our  new  insights  to  answer one of the key questions of this book: what is “media” after  its softwarization?    To  avoid  confusion:  I  am  not  talking  about  the  actual  content  of  media  programs  and  sources,  be  they  television  programs,  newspapers,  blogs,  or  the  terrain  in  Google  Earth.  There  are  already  a  number  of  academic  disciplines  which  study     5 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki 3D_modeling      SOFT  EVOLUTION    205  media content and its reception: Media Studies, Communication,  Journalism, Film and TV Studies, Game Studies, Cultural Studies,  and  Internet  Studies.  I  am  also  not  going  to  talk  about  media  industries—production, distribution, reception, markets, economic  aspects,  etc.,  because  academic  disciplines  already  analyze  these  extensively.  However,  they  usually  do  not  so  closely  analyze  the  tools, technologies and workflows used to produce media content.  Even  when  they  do  this  analysis,  it  is  only  done  in  relation  to  the  tools  of  a  particular  media  field.  This  is  because  the  modern  academic  study  of  culture  follows  the  commercial  culture  indus- tries’ strict division by type of content. Thus, Game Studies looks  at  games,  Film  and  TV  Studies  looks  at  films  and  television  programs,  Design  Studies  looks  at  design,  Internet  Studies  looks  at  the  web,  etc.  Because  of  these  divisions,  these  disciplines  ignore the common features of all media and cultural production  being  done  today  which  are  the  result  of  their  reliance  on  the  same  technology—application  software  for  media  authoring  and  editing.  This is one of the reasons why we need a Software Studies  perspective—to focus our attention on common cultural patterns  related  to  the  use  of  software  technology  in  all  of  these  diverse  cultural fields and media industries.    I will also bracket media reception—in other words, I will try to  define what “media” is today for its creators as opposed to media  consumers.  While in the 2000s there were many discussions about  the blurring of these definitions because of the falling prices of tools  and emergence of social media, in practice they did not get erased.   And  finally,  people  who  know  computer  programming  and  can  create media by writing programs will also have a different under- standing of media—but the majority of content creators use only  application software.    The  universe  of  the  users  of  application  software  includes  “creative professionals”: motion graphics artists, graphic designers,  photographers, video editors, product designers, architects, visual  artists,  etc.  It  also  includes  “prosumers”   or  “pro-ams”   making  anime remixes, editing documentary videos which they will upload  to YouTube or Vimeo, shooting photos which they will post to their  Pro Flickr accounts, or uploading their art images to deviantArt.    I want to understand what it means to create “media” for all  these  people  as  defined  by  the  possibilities  of  the  software  they  are  using—Photoshop,  Gimp,  Illustrator,  InDesign,  After  Effects,    206   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Final Cut, Premiere, CinePaint, Maya, Dreamweaver, WordPress,  Blogger, Flash, OpenOffice, Pages, Microsoft Word, Flame, Maya,  and so on.  And, speaking of Word and other text processing appli- cations, I should also add millions of people who use it daily and  who, therefore, can be considered experts or at least prosumers in  at least one medium—that of text authoring and editing.    Recall  one  of  the  dictionary  definitions  of  a  “medium”  which  opens  Understanding  Metamedia   Chapter  2 :  “A  specific  kind  of artistic technique or means of expression as determined by the  materials  used  or  the  creative  methods  involved.”   For  example,  “the  medium  of  lithography.”   Thus,  different  mediums  have  different  techniques,  means  of  expression  and  creative  methods.  These  differences  certainly  do  not  disappear  when  we  switch  to  software applications. For example, besides the obvious represen- tational and expressive difference between 3D models and moving  images,  a  designer  who  is  modeling  a  game  character  in  Maya  and a designer who is making animation in After Effects will have  access  to  different  sets  of  tools.  But  are  there  some  conceptual  similarities between the way these two designers will be working  because they both use media software?    tions used to create and edit it?    As  I  have  already  discussed,  earlier  physical,  mechanical,  and  electronic  media  consisted  of  two  components:  materials  used  to  hold information and the tools or equipment used to record, edit,  and view this information. For example, the “film medium” used  film stock for information storage, a film camera for recording, a  projector for showing films, and editing devices such as Moviola  and Steenbeck. The medium of hand engraving used metal plates   typically copper  to hold information, and special, hardened steel  tools to create it by making grooves in the plate.   Do  these  two  components  find  their  analogs  in  software?  Here is one answer which we can give to this question: Materials  become  data  structures;  the  physical,  mechanical,  and  electronic  tools are transformed into software tools which operate on these  data structures. From this perspective, regardless of the particular  media field, all designers and artists working with media software  are doing the same thing: using the tools provided by the software  to  create,  modify,  and  edit  data  organized  in  particular  data  structures.   In short: what is “media” today as defined by software applica-      SOFT  EVOLUTION    207    This answer is compelling but not precise. As I already discussed,  many materials are mapped into a single data structure. Thus, the  move  from  physical  media  to  software  apps  involves  a  redistri- bution  of  the  roles  previously  played  by  the  physical  tools  and  materials.  When  I  use  a  watercolor  brush  and  a  rough-textured  paper,  the  resulting  brushstrokes  are  equally  the  result  of  the  brush,  the  liquid,  and  the  paper.  But  when  I  use  a  “watercolor”  brush in Photoshop, or apply a “watercolor” filter to an already  existing image, the result is determined solely by an algorithm, that  modifies the colors of the pixels in a particular manner. The pixels  are only memory locations, which hold the color values—they do  not have any properties of their own, unlike physical materials.    Therefore,  we  do  not  have  a  one-to-one  mapping  between  physical  materials  and  data  structures.  The  same  data  structure   such  as  a  bitmap  image   can  be  used  to  simulate  many  imaging  techniques: from watercolor and engraving to photography. To make  this concrete, look at all JPEG images on your computer. Some are  your photographs uploaded from a mobile phone or digital camera;  others  are  small  graphical  icons  used  by  various  applications;  still  others  may  be  the  notes  you  made  with  a  note-taking  app,  and  so  on.  The  same  data  structures  hold  multiple  media.    This  is  why  rather  than  stating  that  materials  turn  into  data  structures  while  tools  turn  into  algorithms,  it  would  be  more  correct to say that a medium as simulated in software is a combi- nation  of  a  data  structure  and  set  of  algorithms.  The  same  data  structure can be shared across multiple medium simulations, but at  least some of the algorithms will be unique to each medium.   We have arrived at a definition of a software “medium,” which  can be written in this way:  Medium = algorithms + a data structure  Algorithms and data structures happen to be two fundamental  elements of computer programming. In fact, one of the most influ- ential books in the history of computer science is Niklaus Wirth’s  Algorithms  Plus  Data  Structure  Equals  Programs  published  in  1975.  Wirth  and  other  computer  scientists  conceptualized  the  intellectual  work  of  programming  as  consisting  of  two  inter- connected parts: creating the data structures which logically fit  with the task which needs to be done and are computationally    208   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  efficient, and defining the algorithms which operate on these data  structures.   We  can  use  this  conceptual  model  of  computer  programming  to  refine  our  understanding  of  what  media  applications  do.  All  applications,  including  media  software,  are  computer  programs,  so internally they involve algorithms working on data structures.  This point by itself is not very revealing. What is more important is  that these two elements, in my view, also define a mental model a  user has of the application—i.e., how the user understands what an  application presents to him her, and what s he is doing while using  that application. In other words, the user’s mental model reflects  the abstract structure of a computer program  algorithms operating  on  data  structure   that  drives  the  particular  media  application  software.    Inside  the  application  environment,  a  user  is  working  with  one  or  more  documents  which  contain  content  structured  in  a  particular  way.  The  user  is  aware  of  the  importance  of  this  structure—even  though  media  applications  do  not  use  the  term  “data  structure.”  The  user  understands  that  the  data  structure  determines what content can be created and the operations which  can be used to shape and modify it. If I choose vector graphics as  my format, this implies that I will be creating straight and curved  lines and gradients; I will be able to reshape any line in the future  without  losing  quality;  I  will  also  be  able  to  get  perfect  print  output  at  any  resolution.  If  I  select  bitmap  image  as  my  format,  I can work with photographs and other continuous-tone images,  blurring and sharpening details, painting over, applying filters and  so on; but the price for this flexibility is that the image will exhibit  undesirable artifacts if I enlarge it many times.6  In practice, this  selection is done when a user chooses the primary application to  assemble the project. Choosing Illustrator implies that you will be  working  with  vector  graphics;  choosing  Photoshop  implies  that  you will be working with bitmap images. Although each program  also supports working with the opposite image type, the majority  of its functions and its interfaces are organized around its “native”  type.      6 An example of a popular vector file format is Illustrator’s AI format; JPEG and  PSD are examples of bitmap file formats. Certain file formats such as EPS, PDF, and  SWS can hold both vector graphics and bitmap images.      SOFT  EVOLUTION    209    One  more  reminder  because  this  is  important:  the  term  “data  structures” has a particular meaning in computer science, referring  to how data to be processed by a program is organized. As I have  already said, while I want to retain the core idea of data organi- zation, I am not interested here in how this actually happens on the  low-level   i.e.,  whether  the  program  organizes  data  using  arrays,  linked lists, etc. . Instead, I am using this term to refer to the level  of  data  organization,  which  is  made  visible  and  accessible  to  a  user and thus becomes a part of his her mental model of the media  creation  and  editing  process.   For  instance,  when  I  work  with  bitmap  images  in  Photoshop,  I  can  zoom  to  examine  individual  pixels; I can check resolution of my image in pixels, I can choose  the  diameter  of  my  brush,  again  in  pixels;  and  so  on.  All  this  reminds me that my image is a pixel grid.    To summarize this discussion: I suggested that both theoretically  and also experientially—at least for the users who have more than  casual  experiences  with  media  applications—“media”  translates  into two parts which work together. One part is a small number of  basic data structures  or “formats”  which are the foundation of all  modern media software: bitmap image, vector image, 3D polygonal  model, 3D NURBS model, ASCII text, HTML, XML, sound and  video formats, KML, etc. The second part is the algorithms  we can  also call them “operations,” “tools” or “commands”  that operate  on these formats.    The ways in which these two parts are actualized in media appli- cations  require  additional  discussion.  First,  different  applications  often  add  more  details  on  top  on  these  basic  types  to  give  them  additional functionality. For instance, an image as it is defined by  capabilities of Photoshop  a professional and more expensive appli- cation  is substantially different from the way it is defined in the  much less expensive Apple’s iPhoto or Google’s Picasa. As defined  by Photoshop, an image is a complex hierarchical structure.  This  description  refers  to  Adobe  Photoshop  CS5.5.   At  its  base  is  the  basic bitmap image: a grid of pixels. A pixel is a minimal element  that  a  user  can  select  and  modify.  This  is  a  basic  data  structure  Photoshop shares with all other image editors.  Note that while the  user cannot select parts of pixels, the actual algorithms often work  on a sub-pixel level.  A document in Photoshop can contain many  such pixel grids; they are referred to as ‘layers.” The layers can be  collected in groups. They can also form “layer comps”—alternative    210   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  versions  of  the  composition  layout.  Any  single  document  layer  can also have many states: a user can make it visible or invisible,  change  its  transparency,  the  way  it  interacts  with  layers  under- neath,  etc.  Photoshop  also  provides  special  adjustment  layers  that do not contain any pixel content; according to the program  documentation,  “An  adjustment  layer  applies  color  and  tonal  adjustments  to  your  image  without  permanently  changing  pixel  values.”7 Additionally, an image can also have a number of masks  that define which areas of an image can be edited. Other elements  that Photoshop adds to the basic image structure include paths and  vector-based graphics and types.    Photoshop’s  UI  uses  a  number  of  windows  and  menus  to  present  this  complex  image  structure,  with  all  its  possibilities.  The  Document  window  displays  the  actual  composition.  The  Layers panel shows all layers, layer effects, and layer groups in the  composition. The Channels panel shows the color components of  an image  such as R, G, B . Each of these windows has a number  of  controls.  Additionally,  various  menu  items  are  dedicated  to  creating, viewing, and modifying all the possible image parts.  If  data  structures  form  one  part  of  a  user’s  mental  model  of    media  creation  in  software  applications,  the  operations  that  can  be  used  on  these  structures  comprise  the  second  part.  That  is,  the user also understands that the process of defining and editing  the content involves the sequential application of different opera- tions  provided  by  an  application.  Each  operation  corresponds  to  an  algorithm  which  either  performs  some  actions  on  the  already  existing data or generates new data.  Photoshop’s Wave filter is an  example of the former, while the Render Clouds filter is an example  of the latter.     In contemporary media software, the tools that are represented  by items in menus are often referred to as “commands.” The term  “tool”  is  reserved  for  those  frequently  used  operations  that  are  given their own icons and can be selected directly without having  to navigate through the menus.  I will use the word “tool” to refer  to  both  types.   The  applications  group  these  related  operations  together. For example, Photoshop CS5 collects its key tools in the  Tools  Panel;  additional  tools  are  found  under  top-down  menus     7 http:  help.adobe.com en_US Photoshop 11.0       SOFT  EVOLUTION    211  named  Edit,  Image,  Layer,  Select,  Filter,  and  View.  Many  media  applications  also  make  available  additional  tools  in  the  form  of  scripts that can be run from within the application. For example,  in addition to dozens of commands already available in Photoshop  CS5’s menus and panels a user can also run Adobe or third-party  scripts  which  appear  under  File  >  Scripts.  These  scripts  can  be  written  in  JavaScript,  VBScript,  AppleScript,  and  other  scripting  languages. Finally, people who use command-line interfaces such as  Unix  or Linux  can also use a third type of operations—separate  software programs which are run directly from a command line.  For example, two very widely used programs for image and video  conversion and editing are ImageMagic and FFmpeg.8 Since these  types of programs do not have a GUI interface, they are not suitable  for  interactive  image  editing;  however,  they  excel  in  automation  and are often used to perform batch operations  such as conversion  from one file format to another  on a large number of files at once.    Regardless of whether the media tools are presented via GUI, as  scripts, or as separate programs available from a command line, they  all  have  one  thing  in  common—they  can  only  work  on  particular  data  structures.  For  instance,  image-editing  applications  define  dozens  of  tools  for  editing  bitmap  images9—but  these  tools  would  not work on vector graphics. In another example, the techniques for  modification  of  3D  models  that  define  the  volume  of  an  object  are  different  from  the  techniques  that  can  operate  on  3D  models  that  represent the object’s boundary  such as polygonal models .    To  make  an  analogy  with  language,  we  can  compare  data  structures to nouns and algorithms to verbs. To make an analogy  with logic, we can compare them to subjects and predicates. Like  all  metaphors,  these  two  highlight  and  distort,  reveal  and  hide.  However,  I  hope  that  they  can  help  me  to  communicate  my  key  point—the  dual  nature  of  a  “medium”  as  defined  by  software  applications.    We have now arrived at one possible answer to the question we  posed in this book’s introduction: what is media today as defined  by  software  applications  for  its  creation  and  editing?  As  defined  by  application  software  and  experienced  by  users,  a  “medium”     8 http:  www.imagemagick.org , http:  ffmpeg.org    9 This Wikipedia article lists images editing operations common to these programs:  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Image_editing   212   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  is  a  pairing  of  a  particular  data  structure  and  the  algorithms  for  creation, editing and viewing the content stored in that structure.    Now  that  we  have  established  that  computational  media  involves  combining  algorithms  and  data  structures,  we  can  also  better  understand  the  distinction  between  media-specific  and  media-independent techniques that I made earlier. A media-specific  technique is an algorithm that can only operate on a particular data  structure. For example, blur and sharpen filters can only work on  bitmapped images; the “extrude” operation commonly used in 3D  programs to make 3D models can only be applied to a vector curve.  In contrast, a media-independent technique is a set of algorithms  that all perform a conceptually similar task but are implemented  to  work  on  a  number  of  data  structures.  I  mentioned  examples  of these techniques when I introduced this concept—sort, search,  zoom, cut, copy, and paste, randomize, various file manipulations   copy, email, upload, compress, etc. , etc.    To  explain  how  media-independent  techniques  can  be  imple- mented, let us look at the Copy, Cut and Paste commands. These  operations  already  existed  in  some  computer  text  editors  in  the  1960s. In 1974–1975 Larry Tesler implemented these commands  in  a  text  editor  as  part  of  Xerox  PARC’s  work  on  a  personal  computer.10  Recognizing  that  these  commands  can  be  used  in  all  types  of  applications,  the  designers  of  Xerox  Star   released  in  1981  put dedicated keys for these commands in a special keypad.11  The  keypad  contained  keys  marked  Again,  Find,  Same,  Open,  Delete,  Copy,  Merge,  and  Move.  A  user  could  select  any  object  in  an  application  or  on  the  desktop  and  then  select  one  of  these  commands. Xerox PARC team called them “universal commands.”  Apple similarly made these commands available in all applications  running under its unified GUI but got rid of the dedicated keys. 12  Instead, the commands were placed under the Edit pull-down menu.   The idea that a user can select objects in any document regardless  of  the  media,  or  any  file,  and  use  the  same  set  of  commands  on   10 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Cut,_copy,_and_paste 11 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Xerox_Star  February 20, 2012  12 For a close-up view of the dedicated keypad for universal commands and demon- stration of their operations, see the part showing the Xerox Star keyboard in this  video:  http:  www.youtube.com watch?v=Cn4vC80Pv6Q&feature=relmfu   August  4, 2012 .      SOFT  EVOLUTION    213  these objects is among the most important inventions of the Xerox  PARC  team.  It  gives  the  user  a  single  mental  model  of  working  with  documents  across  applications,  and  simplifies  learning  new  programs.    This is how the designers of Xerox Star described one of these  universal commands:  MOVE  is  the  most  powerful  command  in  the  system.  It  is  used  during  text  editing  to  rearrange  letters  in  a  word,  words  in  a  sentence,  sentences  in  a  paragraph,  and  paragraphs  in  a  document.  It  is  used  during  graphics  editing  to  move  picture  elements,  such  as  lines  and  rectangles,  around  in  an  illus- tration. It is used during formula editing to move mathematical  structures,  such  as  summations  and  integrals,  around  in  an  equation.13  However,  depending  on  the  type  of  media  application  and  the  kinds of objects a user selects, “copy,” “cut” or “paste” will trigger  different  algorithms.  For  example,  copying  a  phrase  in  a  text  document requires different sequences of operations than copying  a selection in a bitmap image because the first is a one-dimensional  sequence  of  characters,  while  the  second  is  a  set  of  pixels  in  a  two-dimensional area. And even within a single application, many  different  algorithms  will  be  needed  to  copy  different  kinds  of  objects a user can select.   My  second  example  of  how  implementation  of  a  media- independent technique involves different algorithms that work with  particular media is the generation of random objects. The algorithm  which generates a sequence of random numbers is very simple—it  just calls the random number generator  a function available in all  programming languages  to generate enough numbers, then scales  these numbers within limits specified by the user  for instance, 0 to  1 . This part is media-independent. Different applications can use  this random number generation function as part of media-specific  algorithms  i.e., algorithms which work on particular data struc- tures  to create different types of content. For example, Photoshop  has a command called “Add Noise”  located under Filters > Noise    13 D. Smith, C. Irby, R. Kimball, B. Verplank, B., E.

It then uses  them to select specific pixels in the image and convert them to black  or a random primary color  depending on the chosen option . A 3D  modeling application can use the same technique to generate a set  of identical 3D objects randomly located in space. Sound editing  software can generate random sonic noise; and so on.   The implementation of media-independent techniques is struc- turally  similar  to  various  aesthetic  systems  in  art  that  were  not  limited  to  a  particular  medium:  for  instance,  baroque,  neo-classicism,  constructivism,  post-modernism,  and  remix.  Each  system manifested itself across media. Thus, Baroque aesthetics can  be found in architecture, sculpture, painting, and music; construc- tivism  was  applied  to  product  design,  graphic  design,  clothing,  theatre,  and  possibly  poetry  and  film.14  But  just  as  with  media- independent  techniques,  realizing  a  particular  aesthetic  system  in  different media required some specific artistic devices that explored  possibilities and worked with the limitations of each medium.  File formats  Software uses files to store and transfer data. For example, when  you save a Photoshop image, all its channels, layers, groups, paths,  and  other  information  written  to  file  using  a  particular  format.  Along  with  data  structures,  algorithms  and  UI,  a  file  format  is  another fundamental element of computational media. File formats  are  the  standardized  mechanisms  for  storing  and  accessing  data  organized in a particular structure. Some file formats like .rdf are  in public domain; some like .doc are proprietary. As I will discuss  in  more  detail  in  the  “Design  Workflow”  section  in  Chapter  5,  standardization of file formats is an essential condition for inter- operability between applications that in turn affects the aesthetics  of media created with these applications. From the point of view of  media and aesthetic theory, file formats constitute the “materiality”  of computational media—because bits organized in these formats is  what gets written to a storage media when a file is saved, and also   14 Vlada Petric, Constructivism in Film – A Cinematic Analysis: The Man with the  Movie Camera  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993 .   216   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  because file formats are much more stable than other elements of  computational media  I will explain this below .    Since  both  the  materials  and  tools  of  physical  media  are  now  implemented  as  software,  in  theory  new  file  formats  and  new  algorithms can be easily created at any time, and existing ones can  be extended.  Recall my discussion of “Permanent Extendibility” in  Chapter 1.  However, in contrast to the 1960s and 1970s, when a  few research groups were gradually inventing computational media,  today software is a big global industry. This means that software  innovation is driven by social and economic factors rather than by  theoretical possibilities. As long as file formats are kept constant,  it is easy to add new tools in subsequent software releases and the  old  tools  will  continue  to  work  without  modification.  Moreover,  in  contrast  to  the  period  when  Kay  and  others  were  defining  “the first metamedium,” today millions of individual professional  users—as well as design and architecture firms, film studios, stock  agencies, web design companies, and other creative companies and  groups  around  the  world—store  their  work  and  their  assets   3D  models, photographs, print layouts, websites, etc.  as digital files in  particular formats: .doc, .pdf, tiff, .html, etc. If file formats were to  change all the time, the value of media assets created or owned by  an individual or a company would be threatened.    As a result, in practice file formats change relatively infrequently.  For  example,  the  JPEG  image  format  has  been  in  use  since  1992,  while  the  TIFF  format  goes  back  to  1986.  In  contrast,  the  modifi- cation of software tools which can work on files—creating, editing,  displaying,  and  transmitting  them—and  the  creation  of  new  tools  happens  at  a  fast  pace.  When  a  company  releases  a  new  version  of  its  application  software,  it  usually  adds  various  new  tools  and  rewrites some of the existing ones but the file format stays the same.  This  stability  of  media  file  formats  also  allows  other  developers   both companies and individuals  to create new tools that work on  these formats. In other words, it is one of the conditions that make  “constant extendibility” of media software possible in practice. Here  is an example of this extendibility: when I visited the plugins area of  Adobe’s  Photoshop  website  on  August  5,  2012  it  listed  414  plugin  products.15 Given that a typical product can include a dozen or even   15 http:  www.adobe.com cfusion marketplace index.cfm?event=marketplace.categ ories&marketplaceId=2&offeringtypeid=5  August 5, 2012 .       SOFT  EVOLUTION    217  thousands  of  filters,  presents,  or  action  sets,  the  total  number  of  available  plugins  is  likely  to  run  into  the  hundreds  of  thousands.    Each  file  format  and  its  corresponding  data  structure  has  its  strengths  and  weaknesses.  A  photograph  represented  as  a  bitmapped image can be given a painterly appearance; blurred and  sharpened;  composited  with  another  photograph,  and  so  on.  All  these operations are much more difficult or even impossible with a  vector image. Conversely, it is much easier to edit complex curves  if  they  are  internally  represented  by  mathematical  formulas—a  format  used  by  vector  drawing  programs  such  as  Illustrator  and  Inscape. Because many projects call for the combination of effects  only  possible  with  different  data  structures   such  as  raster  and  vector , over time professional software applications were extended  to handle the corresponding file formats in addition to their native  format  type.  For  example,  while  the  majority  of  Photoshop  CS4  tools are geared towards raster images, it also includes some tools  for  working  with  vector  drawings.  Photoshop  can  also  import  vector graphics, while Illustrator can import bitmap images.    However,  this  hybridization  of  software  applications  does  not  change the fact that each separate application tool can only work on  a particular data structure. This is true for universal commands such  as “cut,” “copy,” “paste,” and “view,” as well as for a multitude of  media-specific commands such as “word count,” “blur,” “extrude”  and “echo.” Thus, behind both media-independent and media-specific  tools are separate algorithms each designed to work with particular  data structures. However, a user has a different understanding of the  two types, since the implementation is not visible directly. The former  bring  all  media  types  together  conceptually,  and  even  creates  an  imaginary horizon where all differences between them disappear; at  the same time, the latter emphasizes these differences since they only  become available when a user works with a particular media.    As  the  name  indicates,  computer  “files”  refer  to  the  paper  files  that  were  the  key  information  management  technology  of  a  mid-twentieth-century  office  when  computers  were  developed.  The word “file” was used already in 1950 in RCA advertisement  for its new “memory” vacuum tube; in 1952 the word was used  to  refer  to  information  stored  on  punch  cards.16  With  the  devel-   16 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Computer_file   218   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  opment of the Web in the 1990s, web “documents”17 such as web  pages  became  equally  important.  A  web  page  may  consist  of  a  single HTML file that contains static text, and other media content  stored on a server. Alternatively, a web page may be “dynamic,”  which means that is constructed when the user accesses its address;  it can also change as a result of user interaction.18 Dynamic web  pages can be constricted using client-side scripting  e.g. JavaScript ;  they can be also constructed using server-side scripting  PHP, Perl,  Java, and other languages . The two methods can also be combined  using Ajax techniques; for example, the popular web application  that uses Ajax is Google Earth. In 2011, HTML 5, the next gener- ation  of  the  HTML  standard,  enabled  multimedia  and  graphics  elements  including  video,  audio,  and  SVG  graphics  without  the  need for client side plugins. As these and other technologies were  gradually developed and adopted, the identity of the web has been  gradually changing—from static pages in the first half of the 1990s  to  “rich  internet  applications”  that  match  much  of  the  function- ality of traditional desktop applications.19   Given the complexity and variety of web documents and appli- cations  types,  the  multitude  of  technologies  and  techniques  for  creating them, and the continuous evolution of both technologies  and  web  conventions,  it  would  not  be  appropriate  to  simply  mechanically  map  our  concept  of  media  data  structures  to  the  web.  If  we instead  focus  more  on  the  meaning  of  data  structure  as  a  mental  model  of  media  shared  by  designers  and  users,  as  opposed  to  its  technical  implementations,  then  this  concept  does  apply  to  the  web  documents  and  applications.  However,  rather  than  referring  to  the  type  of  media  and  its  characteristics   text,  bitmap image, vector image, sound, 3D model, etc.  that become  elements  of  a  web  document  or  an  application,  we  can  also  use  it to describe the interaction possibilities and conventions offered  by  a  web  document  or  an  application.  For  example,  web  pages  typically  continue  to  have  hyperlinks  that  allow  a  user  to  go  to  related  pages.  Today  a  web  page  may  contain  “social  media  buttons” which allows users to easily share some content on the  page.  Particular  genres  of  web  documents  and  applications  offer   17 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Web_document 18 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Dynamic_web_page 19 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Rich_Internet_application      SOFT  EVOLUTION    219  their  own  interaction  possibilities:  for  example,  a  blog  typically  contains a list of blog posts organized by dates; a webmail appli- cation contains buttons for responding, forwarding, and archiving  email; and so on.   Although  in  principle  I  can  go  through  all  the  most  widely  used  types  of  web  documents  and  applications,  and  write  down  a  list  of  their  conventions  as  they  exist  right  now,  this  list  will  be  both  very  long  and  no  longer  accurate  by  the  time  my  book  manuscript  comes  out  in  print.  This  is  one  of  the  reasons  why  this book focuses on discussion of media as representation rather  than  as  communication  and  interaction—because  the  structures  of software-based representations are more stable, less numerous,  less complex, and change much less frequently than software and  network based communication and interaction technologies. This  does not mean that I give up on the project of understanding web  media   including  mobile  applications,  which  currently  number  in  the  hundreds  of  thousands —instead,  I  hope  to  do  it  more  comprehensively in the future, while limiting myself to only brief  discussions in this book.  Parameters  As  I  suggested  earlier,  a  user’s  mental  model  of  media  creation  and editing—both in the context of a particular application type,  and when dealing with “digital media” in general—contains two  fundamental  elements,  which,  both  conceptually  and  practically,  correspond to two elements of computer programming: algorithms  and  data  structures.  When  a  user  selects  a  particular  tool  from  a  menu  and  uses  it  on  the  part  of  the  document  s he  is  working  on,  the  algorithm  behind  this  tool  modifies  the  data  structure  that stores the content of the part. Most users, of course, do not  know the details of how media software works on a programming  level, and they may be only vaguely aware of what an algorithm  is.   In  2011  I  was  driving  towards  San  Francisco  and  saw  a  big  ad  board  along  the  road,  which  prominently  featured  the  word  “algorithm”—but I could not stop to snap a picture that I really  wanted to include in this book.  However, unknown to them, the  principles of contemporary computer programming are “projected”  to the UI level—shaping how users work with media via software    220   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  applications  practically,  and  how  they  understand  this  process  cognitively. The data structure algorithm model is one example of  this. We will now look at another example of such “projection”:  options and their implementation.    One  of  the  principles  of  modern  computer  programming— regardless  of  programming  paradigm  and  programming  language—is the use of parameters.20 The popularity of parameters   which are also called “variables” or “arguments”  is due to several  reasons.  One  is  the  common  modern  programming  practice  of  breaking  a  program  into  separate  functions.  If  a  program  has  to  execute the same sequence of steps more than once, a programmer  encapsulates  this  sequence  in  a  single  function  which  can  be  then evoked within the program by its name as often as needed.   Depending  on  the  programming  language,  functions  maybe  be  called  procedures,  methods,  subroutines,  or  routines.   Dividing  a  large  program  into  separate  modular  functions  makes  it  easier  to  write,  read,  and  maintain.   This  programming  paradigm  is  called Procedural Programming.  Functions that perform concep- tually  related  tasks   for  instance,  generating  graphics  on  the  display  screen   are  collected  in  software  libraries;  such  libraries  are  available  for  all  popular  programming  languages  and  their  use greatly speeds up software development. A function definition  typically includes a number of parameters that control the details  of its execution. For example, a function that translates an image  into another format will have a parameter specifying whether the  output  format  should  be  JPEG,  PNG,  TIFF,  or  another  format.   And if you choose JPEG, you will get another parameter to specify  the  level  of  compression .  The  second  reason  for  the  popularity  of parameters is that many functions  and whole programs  solve  mathematical equations. A formula defines a relationship between  variables. For example, a sine formula looks like this: y=A*sin w*x  + O , where A stands for amplitude, w is frequency, and O is phase.  If we implement this formula as a software function, this function  will have parameters for each variable  i.e., w, x and O .    If  you  do  not  program,  you  may  still  be  familiar  with  the  concept  of  parameters  if  you  use  formulas  in  Excel  or  Google  Docs spreadsheet. For example, to generate a column of random   20 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Argument_ computer_science       SOFT  EVOLUTION    221  numbers,  you  can  fill  its  cells  with  the  function  RAND  .  The  formula does not have any parameters; it simply generates random  numbers that fall between 0 and 1. If you want to generate random  numbers which fall within a different range, use a different formula  RANDBETWEEN bottom, top . This formula has two parameters  which specify minimum and maximum values of the numbers of  the range. For example, RANDBETWEEN 10, 20  generates a set  of random values which lie between 10 and 20.   In  a  modern  GUI  the  parameters,  which  control  program  execution,  are  called  options.  Users  specify  the  values  for  the  options using text boxes, sliders, buttons, drop-down lists, check  boxes, and radio buttons. Sometimes the interface provides a few  possible  values  and  a  user  can  only  choose  from  them;  in  other  cases  she  can  enter  her  own  value;  in  still  other  cases  an  appli- cation  provides  both  possibilities.  For  example,  a  typical  color  picker allows a user to set R, G, and B values to create a unique  color; alternatively s he can choose from a set of predefined color  swatches.    Use  of  options  greatly  expands  the  functionality  of  software  applications by allowing the same application to perform a wider  range of actions. For instance, imagine that you need to sort a set  of  numbers.  Instead  of  using  two  separate  programs  to  perform  the  sort  in  ascending  and  descending  order,  you  can  use  a  single  program and set the parameter value, which would determine what  kind of sort to perform. Or, imagine a round brush tool included  in an image editing application’s toolbox. You would not want to  see  a  separate  tool  for  every  possible  color,  every  possible  brush  radius,  and  every  possible  transparency  setting.  Instead,  a  single  tool is given options which control color, radius, and transparency.    What  does  this  mean  for  media  theory?  With  softwarization,  the  implicit  possibilities  and  different  ways  of  using  physical  tools are made fully explicit. “Artistic techniques” and “means of  expression”  see the definition of a medium which opens Part 1  are  given  explicit  and  detailed  controls.  Like  all  computer  programs  or functions, they now come with many parameters. For instance,  Photoshop  CS5’s  basic  brush  tool  has  these  parameters:  size,  hardness,  mode,  airbrush  capacity,  opacity,  and  flow.  Hardness,  opacity, and flow can have any value between 0 and 100; there are  25 modes to choose from; and the diameter can vary from 1 pixel  to 2500 pixels.   222   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND    Do  most  users  need  all  these  options  and  such  a  degree  of  precision?  Probably  not.  For  example,  controlling  opacity  in  5  percent  intervals  will  probably  be  quite  sufficient  for  most  users.  However,  the  algorithm  that  implements  opacity  behavior  is  exactly  the  same  regardless  of  whether  a  particular  parameter  can  have  10  settings,  or  100.  Since  the  general  logic  of  software  industry is to always try to offer users “more” than the previous  application’s version or competitors, it is understandable that the  brush interface gives us the larger number of options and a larger  choice  of  their  values,  even  though  such  precision  may  be  not  needed.  The  same  goes  for  most  other  tools  available  in  media  software. In this way, the logic of programming is projected to the  GUI level and becomes part of user’s cognitive model of working  with media inside applications.    While adding more options does require additional programming  labor, offering more values for these options typically does not. If I  want the brush tool to have a transparency option, I need to write  new code to simulate this behavior. However, giving a user a choice  of  20  or  100  possible  values  for  transparency  does  not  cost  me  anything. Like any other media tool a brush tool is an algorithm  that takes some inputs and generates outputs by applying a number  of  computations  to  these  inputs.  In  the  case  of  a  brush  tool,  the  inputs are the values of the options set by the users, and the colors  of the pixels over which the brush moves; the outputs are the new  pixel values. The algorithm does not care what the particular input  values are, and the number of steps required to execute them also  does not change because of particular values.   Pre-industrial physical media tools did not have explicit controls.  There  were  no  numerical  parameters  to  set  on  a  pen,  brush,  or  chisel. If you wanted to change the diameter of a brush, you picked  a different brush. The industrial era introduced new types of media  tools  that  were  mechanical  or  electronic  machines:  the  electrical  telegraph,  photo  camera,  film  camera,  film  projector,  gramo- phone, telephone, television, and video camera. Like all industrial  machines  they  now  came  with  a  few  controls.  Physically  these  controls appeared as knobs, levers, and dials. The next generation  of media—software applications—give explicit controls to all the  tools  they  include.  The  tools  that  did  not  have  explicit  controls  before  now  acquired  them;  the  tools  that  had  a  few  were  given  many  more.   While  machines  made  from  mechanical  parts  can       SOFT  EVOLUTION    223  introduced  the   have only a limited number of possible settings, software param- eters typically can have practically unlimited range of values.    The  Language  of  New  Media  idea  of  “transcoding”—the  mapping  of  the  conventions  and  principles  of  software  engineering  to  cultural  concepts  and  perceptions.  The  explicit  parameterization  of  all  media  creating  and  editing  techniques  implemented  in  software  is  a  perfect  instance  of  transcoding  logic.  Thus,  the  fact  that  Photoshop’s  brush  tool  comes with a number of options controls and that opacity and flow  can take any value between 0 and 100 is only partially related to  the meaning of this command—a simulation of different physical  brushes. The real reason for this implementation of the command  lies in its identity as a computer program.  As I already discussed,  in  modern  programming,  programs  and  their  parts  are  given  parameters, which in many cases can take any arbitrary numbers  as inputs.    Along  with  being  a  good  example  of  how  principles  and  conventions of software development in general are carried over  into  media  applications  and  our  media  lives,  parameterization  also exemplifies another trend. Seemingly different media activ- ities—editing photographs, creating 3D game characters, editing  a video, or working on a website design or a mobile application— become similar in their logic and workflow: select a tool, choose  its parameters, apply it; and repeat this sequence until the project  is done.    Of course, we should not forget that the practices of computer  programming are embedded within the economic and social struc- tures  of  the  software  and  consumer  electronics  industries.  These  structures impose their own set of constraints and prerogatives on  the  implementation  of  hardware  and  software  controls,  options,  and  preferences   all  these  terms  are  just  different  manifestations  of  software  parameters .  Looking  at  the  history  of  media  appli- cations  and  media  electronics  devices,  we  can  observe  a  number  of trends. Firstly, the number of options in media software tools  and  devices  marketed  to  professionals  gradually  increases.  For  example,  a  significant  number  of  Photoshop’s  tools  and  filters  have  more  options  and  controls  than  in  earlier  versions  of  the  application. Secondly, features originally made available in profes- sional products later become available in consumer-level products.  However,  to  preserve  the  products’  identities  and  justify  price    224   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  differences  between  different  products,  a  significant  difference  in  feature sets is continuously maintained between the two types of  products, with professional software and equipment having more  tools and more parameters than their consumer equivalents. Thus  Photoshop has lots of tools, Photoshop Elements offers fewer tools  and iPhoto and Picasa have fewer still.    All this is obvious—however, there is also a third trend, more  interesting  for  media  theory.  Following  the  paradigm  already  established by the end of the nineteenth century when the Kodak  company started to market its cameras accompanied by a slogan  “you  push  the  button,  we  do  the  rest”   1892 ,  contemporary  software  applications  and  media  devices  aimed  at  consumers  significantly  automate  media  capture  and  editing  in  comparison  to their professional counterparts. For example, during the 2000s  many consumer digital cameras only offered automatic exposure;  to get full manual controls one had to go to the next price category  of semi-professional cameras. In another example, towards the end  of that decade, consumer cameras started to incorporate automatic  face  and  smile  detection—features  that  were  not  available  on  expensive professional cameras.    Like any other type of automation, automatic exposure requires  more computing steps than the use of manual settings; the same goes  for applying “auto contrast” or “auto tone” commands available  in media software. Thus, if we equate the use of computers with  automation, paradoxically it is the consumers who fully enjoy its  benefits—in  contrast  to  professionals  who  have  to  labor  over  all  these  manual  settings  of  all  these  controls…  but  of  course,  this  is  what  they  paid  for:  to  achieve  effects  and  results  that  built-in  automation  cannot  deliver.  At  the  same  time,  by  offering  more  high-level  automation  in  consumer-priced  products,  the  industry  unintentionally undermines the professionals’ skills. For instance,  today a number of web-based applications and application plug-ins  can take a portrait photo and improve contrast, correct skin tone,  remove  skin  imperfections  and  wrinkles—all  in  one  step.  The  results can be surprisingly good—maybe not good enough for the  cover of Vogue but quite sufficient for posting the improved photo  to one’s profile on a social network site.    Interestingly, in the beginning of the 2010s this trend was partly  reversed. Because of the much larger size of the consumer market  and faster release cycles, hardware and software makers started to       SOFT  EVOLUTION    225  offer some new features first in lower-level products and then only  later  in  more  expensive  products.  For  example,  Apple’s  Aperture  3   2010   added  options  which  had  already  been  made  available  earlier in a consumer-level iPhoto application in its 2009 release— Faces   face  recognition   and  Places   a  system  for  identifying  geo  locations of the photos and locating them on a map interface .21   The metamedium or the monomedium?  Given  fundamental  similarity  in  how  “mediums”  function  as  implemented  in  software,  a  logical  question  arises:  do  we  need  to  talk  about  different  mediums  at  all?  In  other  words,  is  the  computer metamedium a collection of simulated, new, and yet-to- be-invented media, or is it one “mono-medium”? Are we dealing  with the metamedium or the monomedium?    We now understand that in software culture, what we identify by  conceptual inertia as “properties” of different mediums are actually  the  properties  of  media  software—their  interfaces,  the  tools,  and  the  techniques  they  make  possible  for  accessing,  navigating,  creating,  modifying,  publishing,  and  sharing  media  documents.  For example, the ability to automatically switch between different  views of a document in Acrobat Reader or Microsoft Word is not  a property of “electronic documents” in general, but as a result of  software  techniques  whose  heritage  can  be  traced  to  Engelbart’s  “view  control.”  Similarly,  the  ability  to  change  the  number  of  segments that make up a vector curve is not a property of “vector  images”—it  is  an  option  available  in  some   but  not  all   vector  drawing software.    As we have learned, every media software also includes at least  some tools that are not media-specific—i.e. they are not limited to  working on particular data structures like raster images or vector  drawings.  Originally  conceptualized  at  Xerox  PARC  as  ways  to  enable  users  to  transfer  the  cognitive  habits  learned  in  using  one  application  to  other  applications,  today  a  small  number  of  Xerox’s  “universal  commands”  have  become  a  larger  number  of   21 http:  photo.net equipment software aperture-3 review   March 4, 2012 .   226   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  “media-independent” media tools and interface techniques which  are shaping how users understand all types of media content.    Despite  these  fundamental  ways  in  which  distinct  mediums  become  aligned  conceptually  and  practically,  I  do  not  want  to  abandon  the  concept  of  different  mediums  altogether.  The  substantial differences between the operations for media authoring  and editing supported by different data structures  in the sense of  this term used here  is one reason to keep this concept. And here  are three additional reasons:   1.  “Mediums”  as  they  are  implemented  in  software  are  part  of distinct cultural histories that go back for hundreds and often  thousands of years. Electronic text is part of the history of writing;  digital  moving  images  are  part  of  the  history  of  a  moving  image  which includes shadow plays, phantasmagoria, nineteenth century  optical toys, cinema, and animation; a digital photograph is part of  almost 200 years of photography history. These histories influence  how we understand and use these media today.    Put differently, we can say that any film today exists against the  horizon of all films ever made and a subset of those films which a  particular person making or watching a particular film has seen in  their life; similarly, any digital image exists against the horizon of  all images in a “museum without walls”  André Malraux  of human  visual history. A medium, then, is not just a set of materials and  tools   whether  physical,  mechanical,  electronic,  or  implemented  in  software   and  artistic  techniques  supported  by  these  tools— it  is  also  an  imaginary  database  of  all  expressive  possibilities,  compositions,  emotional  states  and  dynamics,  representational  and communication techniques, and “content” actualized in all the  works created with a particular combination of certain materials  and tools.    Systematic digitization of cultural heritage is gradually turning  this  imaginary  database  into  a  real  one.  By  2012,  Google  has  digitized  20  million  books,  while  artstor.org  offered  over  one  million images of art and architecture digitized by 228 museums  and  private  collections.  However,  this  process  did  not  start  with  digital computers. In the early twentieth century the development  of public art museums, illustrated art magazines and books, lantern  slide  lectures,  and  the  academic  study  of  arts  in  the  universities  made large numbers of previously created artworks directly visible  and  accessible  to  the  public   as  opposed  to  small  numbers  only       SOFT  EVOLUTION    227  accessible to art patrons . For instance, American museums started  to  develop  lantern  slide  collections  of  their  holdings  after  1865;  in  1905  the  University  of  California  at  Berkeley  offered  the  first  architecture history course that used lantern slides.22   The  digitization  of  cultural  collections  since  1990  started  to  gradually  bring  together  the  materials  dispersed  among  all  these  already available resources, making them searchable and accessible  through single websites. For example, by early 2012 Europeana23  provided  information  and  links  to  20  million  digitized  cultural  objects  including  paintings,  drawings,  maps,  books,  newspapers,  diaries,  music  and  spoken  word  from  cylinders,  tapes,  discs  and  radio  broadcasts,  and  films,  newsreels  and  TV  broadcasts,  contributed by 1500 European institutions.24 In the UK, the BBC’s  Your  Painting  project  was  set  up  to  offer  free  online  access  to  digital images of all 212,000 paintings from all UK national collec- tions; this goal was achieved by 2013.25 In the US, the Library of  Congress  provides  access  to  dozens  of  digital  collections  from  a  single  portal.  The  collections  include  4.7  million  high-resolution  newspaper  pages   1860–   and  over  one  million  digital  images,  such as 171,000 scanned photo negatives from the Farm Security  Administration Office of War Information program  1935–45 .26    These  institutional  digitized  collections  are  supplemented  by  user-uploaded born-digital and digitized cultural artifacts. YouTube  and  other  video  sharing  sites  contain  a  substantial  sample  of  all  cinema history in the form of short clips. Flickr has a large number  of photos of artworks taken by museum visitors around the world.  Portfolio sites for professional media creators such as Coroflot.com  and  Behance.com  contain  millions  of  portfolios  in  art  direction,  exhibition design, illustration, interaction design, motion graphics,  and  other  fields.  Manga  scanlation  websites  contain  millions  of  fan  scanned  and  translated  manga  pages   as  of  March  4,  2012,  mangapark.com hosted 5,730,252 pages for 9020 manga series27 ;  Scribd.com  hosts  tens  of  millions  of  text  documents   you  will   22 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Slide_library 23 http:  www.europeana.eu  24 http:  pro.europeana.eu web guest news press-releases  March 4, 2012 . 25 http:  www.bbc.co.uk arts yourpaintings   January 31, 2013 . 26 http:  www.loc.gov library libarch-digital.html  March 4, 2012 . 27 http:  www.mangapark.com   March 4, 2012 .   228   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  most  likely  find  this  book  there  as  well ;  the  deviantArt  online  community for user-generated art hosts over 100 million submis- sions from 190 countries  Spring 2012 data .28    Although the distribution of what is available in all these online  archives is highly uneven in relation to the types of media, historical  periods, countries, and so on, it is safe to say that today the cultural  classics—i.e.  works  of  famous  film  directors,  cinematographers,  graphic  designers,  media  designers,  composers,  painters,  writers,  and  so  on—are  all  available  online  either  in  complete  form  or  in  parts.  As  a  result,  the  idea  of  a  “medium”  in  a  sense  of  all  the  creative  works  and  possibilities  realized  so  far  using  a  set  of  technologies  has  become  quite  real.  As  opposed  to  holding  the  imaginary database of key works in a particular medium in your  head  not the most reliable place for such large-scale storage , you  can now quickly consult the web to locate and study any of them.  Further, you are not limited to the holdings of a single museum or a  library at a time; instead, you can use Europeana, Artstor, or other  large-scale collection aggregators to browse their combined metac- ollections.  For  example,  while  the  National  Gallery  in  London  has 2,300 paintings, Your Painting site from BBC offers images of  212,000 paintings from all UK national collections.    2. We can also use the term “medium” to refer to a presentation  interaction  platform.  If  you  think  of  iOS  and  Android  platforms   each  containing  mobile  devices,  an  operating  system,  and  apps   as examples, you are right—but I also would like to use the word  “platform” in a more general sense. Medium as a platform refers  to  a  set  of  resources  that  allows  users  to  access  and  manipulate  content in particular ways. Understood in that way, a white cube in  a modern art gallery is a medium; so are a modern movie theatre,  a print magazine, network television, and a DVD.  Note that just  as iOS and Android are ecosystems that combine many elements,  many  older  media  platform  work  similarly.  Movie  theatres,  film  production, distribution, and publicity form the cinema platform;  so do television production, distribution, and TV sets.    This meaning of “medium” is related to the twentieth-century  concept  of  “media”  in  Communication  Studies,  which  came  from Shannon’s Information Theory: the storage and transmission   28 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki deviantArt      SOFT  EVOLUTION    229  channels and tools used to store and deliver information. However,  if  the  latter  concept  includes  both  storage  and  transmission  channels and tools, my “presentation platform” puts more focus  on  the  reception  technologies.  These  technologies  may  include  special  spaces,  architecture   for  example,  large  media  surfaces  which  are  increasingly  becoming  part  of  buildings’  interiors  and  exteriors ,  sensors,  lights,  and,  of  course,  media  viewing editing  sharing devices and apps. Presentation platforms also “program”  particular  patterns  of  behavior:  one  walks  through  and  touches  architecture; stays silent in a movie theatre; interacts with family  members while watching TV, moves one’s body in front of an inter- active wall; etc.    During  the  nineteenth  and  twentieth  centuries,  presentation  platforms  were  closely  tied  up  with  particular  types  of  media  content. Art museums displayed paintings and sculptures  and later  performances  and  installations ;  newspapers  published  texts  and  images; TV presented television shows, news programs, and films.  The gradual addition of media viewing and playing capabilities to  computers  and later laptops, mobile phones, tablets, media players  and  other  computer-based  devices   loosened  this  connection.  Distribution, storage, and presentation of different media types were  no longer tied up to particular technologies and particular presen- tation  platform.   This  separation  parallels  the  similar  process  of  “softwarization” I have discussed in detail: the tools and techniques  for media authoring and editing have become liberated from their  reliance on particular physical and electronic technologies.    Today, we can access most types of media on every computer  platform.  You  can  view  images,  videos,  text  documents  and  maps inside email, in a browser, on your notebook, a PC, laptop,  tablet, mobile phone, internet-enabled TV, or an in-car or in-flight  entertainment  system.  What  differentiates  these  devices  is  neither  the types of contents they can play, nor the basic interfaces they  provide  for  viewing  and  interacting  with  content,  but  rather  the  relative ease with which one can navigate various media.    For instance, my 2011 Samsung LCD-TV came with a full web  browser—however  it  was  much  better  at  playing  cable  TV  and  Netflix  content  than  web  browsing  experience,  which  was  quite  hard with a TV remote control. In another example, the relatively  small screen of a mobile phone in the early 2010s, its less powerful  processor, and its smaller amount of RAM makes it a less-than-ideal    230   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  platform for editing feature films or doing CAD  Computer Aided  Design .  At  the  same  time,  the  same  small  size  gives  a  mobile  phone platform many advantages. In many countries it is socially  acceptable for a person to engage in chat or send and receive SMS  on their phone during a social meal—but doing it on a laptop would  be inappropriate. The size of a mobile phone also makes it a perfect  device for location-based social networking  e.g., Foursquare  and  other  services:  recommending  social  events  in  a  city,  following  friends on a map, playing location-aware games, and so on.29    Similar  to  mobile  phones,  many  platforms  take  advantage  of  their social settings by adding unique features. For example, some  airline  in-flight  entertainment  electronics  systems   e.g.,  Virgin  America’s  and  V  Australia’s  RED  Entertainment  System30   allow  passengers  to  chat  with  other  passengers  or  participate  in  multi- player games with them.    As  a  media  presentation  and  interaction  platform,  each  type  of  computer-based  consumer  device  has  its  differences.  Currently   early 2013 , some mobile platforms such as iOS do not allow users  to save documents directly to the device; instead, files can only be  saved  inside  their  respective  apps.  31  Some  media  devices  such  as  e-book readers, video players, audio players, digital billboards, and  game consoles often can only play a few  or even just one  type of  media content.  While consumer electronics companies are engaged  in the ongoing “convergence” war, gradually adding ability to play  all  media  types  to  most  devices,  this  trend  does  not  affect  every  single device.    Given the differences in their physical appearance  size, weight,  form  factor ,  physical  interface   touchscreen,  keyboard,  remote  control, voice input, motion sensing  and media playback editing  sharing networking  capabilities,  it  is  tempting  to  think  of  each  type  of  device  as  a  different  “medium.”  As  presentation inter- action  platforms  these  devices  provide  distinct  user  experiences  and encourage distinct sets of media behaviors  sharing location,  working, chatting, etc. . However, we should also remember that  since they all use the same technologies—computers, software, and  networks—they also share many fundamental features.   29 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Location-based_service 30 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki In-flight_entertainment 31 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Mobile_platform      SOFT  EVOLUTION    231    Given this, we may want to think of all these presentation inter- action platforms using the idea of “family resemblance” articulated  by many nineteenth-century thinkers and later by Wittgenstein— that things may be “connected by a series of overlapping similarities,  where no one feature is common to all.”32 But this would not be  accurate. Prototype theory, developed by the 1970s by psychologist  Eleanor  Rosch  and  other  researchers,  may  fare  better.  Based  on  psychological experiments, Rosch showed that for a human mind,  some members of many semantic categories are better representa- tives of these categories than other members  or example, a chair is  more prototypical of the category “furniture” than a mirror.33     If  we  consider  the  best  current  implementation  of  Kay’s  vision augmented with networking and sharing capabilities as the  prototype  i.e.  the  most  central  member  of  the  category   “of the  computer metamedium”  for me, my current Apple laptop would  qualify  as  such  a  prototype,  but  any  full-featured  laptop  will  also do , then all other computer devices can be situated at some  distance  from  the  prototype  based  on  how  well  they  instantiate  this  vision.  Of  course,  it  is  also  possible  to  argue  that  none  of  the  current  computers  or  computer  devices  realizes  Kay’s  vision  sufficiently, because casual users cannot easily program them and  invent  new  media.   Appropriately,  Kay  named  his  1997  Turing  Award  lecture  “The  Computer  Revolution  Hasn’t  Happened  Yet.”34   In  this  interpretation,  Kay’s  Dynabook  is  the  imaginary  ideal  prototype,  and  each  realized  computer  device  is  situated  at  some distance from it.    3.  Another  important  meaning  of  the  concept  “medium”  is  related to human sensory systems, which acquire and process infor- mation  in  different  ways.  Each  sensory  system  contains  sensory  receptors,  neural  pathways,  and  particular  parts  of  the  brain  responsible  for  further  processing.  Traditional  human  cultures  recognized  five  senses:  sight,  hearing,  taste,  smell,  and  touch.  Additionally, humans can also sense temperature, pain, positions  of body parts, balance, and acceleration.   32 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Family_resemblance 33 Eleanor  Rosch,  “Cognitive  Representation  of  Semantic  Categories.”  Journal  of  Experimental Psychology: General 104, no.3,  September 1975 : pp. 192–233.  34 http:  blog.moryton.net 2007 12 computer-revolution-hasnt-happened-yet.html   March 5, 2012 .   232   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND    Because the concept of senses has been important for ancient and  modern  Western  philosophy,  Buddhist  thought,  and  other  intel- lectual  traditions,  the  discussions  of  senses  in  relation  to  art  and  aesthetics have also been very extensive, so to enter them seriously  would require its own book. Instead, I will limit myself to a short  discussion of a more recent research in cognitive psychology that  can be used to support the idea of multiple mediums: how different  types of information are represented and manipulated in the brain.    The  important  question  debated  in  cognitive  psychology  for  forty  years  is  whether  human  cognition  operates  on  more  than  one type of mental representation. One view is that the brain only  uses  a  single  propositional  representation  for  different  types  of  information. According to this view, what we experience as mental  images  are  internally  translated  by  the  mind  into  language-like  propositions.35  The  alternative  view  is  that  the  brain  represents  and  processes  images  using  a  separate  representational  system.  After decades of psychological and neurological studies, the current  consensus supports this second view.36 Thus, it is believed the brain  operates  on  and  maintains  mental  images  as  mental  image-like  wholes, as opposed to translating them into propositions.   If we accept this view that language, and images spatial forms  require  the  use  of  different  mental  processes  and  representa- tions  for  their  processing—propositional   i.e.,  concept-based,  or  linguistic   for  the  former,  and  visual spatial   or  pictorial   for  the  latter,  it  helps  us  to  understand  why  the  human  species  needed  both writing and visual spatial media. Different mediums allow us  to  use  these  different  mental  processes.  In  other  words,  if  media  are “tools for thought”  to quote again the title of a 1984 book  by  Howard  Rheingold  about  computers37   through  which  we  think and communicate the results of our thinking to others, it is  logical that we would want to use the tools to let us think verbally,  visually, and spatially.   35 http:  plato.stanford.edu entries mental-representation  36 Tim  Rohrer,  “The  Body  in  Space:  Dimensions  of  Embodiment,”  in  Body,  Language and Mind, vol. 2, eds.

Dirven  Berlin:  Mouton de Gruyter, 2007 . 37 Howard  Rheingold,  Tools  for  Thought:  The  History  and  Future  of  Mind-Expanding  Technology,  a  revised  edition  of  the  original  book  published  in  1985  The MIT Press, 2000 .      SOFT  EVOLUTION    233    An hypothesis about the existence of propositional and pictorial  representations  in  the  mind  is  one  example  of  a  number  of  theories  which  all  share  the  basic  belief  that  human  thinking  and  understanding  are  not  limited  to  the  use  of  language.  For  example, in 1983 Howard Gardner proposed a theory of multiple  intelligences,  which  included  eight  different  categories:  bodily- kinesthetic, verbal-linguistic, visual-spatial, musical, interpersonal,  logical-mathematical,  naturalistic,  and  intrapersonal.  Recall  also  that  Alan  Kay  based  the  design  of  the  GUI  on  the  work  of  the  psychologist Jerome Bruner who postulated the existence of three  modes  of  representation  and  cognition:  enactive   action-based ,  iconic  image-based  and symbolic  language . And while in Xerox  PARC’s implementation the appeal to the first modality was limited  to  the  selection  of  objects  on  the  screen  using  a  mouse,  more  recently they were joined by touch interfaces and gesture interfaces.  Thus,  the  interfaces  of  modern  computers  and  computer-based  devices  are  themselves  prime  examples  of  a  multiple  media  at  work—adding  over  time  more  media  as  interaction  mechanisms,  rather  than  converging  to  a  single  one,  like  written  language   original UNIX and other OS from 1960s–1970s  or speech  Hal  from Kubrick’s 2001 .  The evolution of media species  As we see, while softwarization redefines what mediums are and  how  they  interact,  it  does  not  erase  the  idea  of  multiple  distinct  mediums. In fact, in contrast to the idea of “convergence” popular  in  the  2000s  in  discussing  the  coming  together  of  computers,  television, and telephony, I would like you to think of the compu- tational  media  using  the  concept  of  biological  evolution   which  implies increasing diversity over time . And here comes the ultimate  difficulty  with  continuing  to  use  the  term  “medium”  as  a  useful  descriptor for a set of cultural and artistic activities. The problem  is not that multiple mediums converge into one “monomedium”— they  do  not.  The  problem  is  exactly  the  opposite:  they  multiply  to  such  extent  that  the  term  loses  its  usefulness.  Most  large  art  museums  and  art  schools  usually  have  between  four  and  six  departments  which  supposedly  correspond  to  different  mediums    234   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND   for example, San Francisco’s Museum of Modern Art divides its  collection  into  painting  and  sculpture,  photography,  architecture  and  design,  and  media  arts38 —and  this  is  OK.  We  can  still  use  unique  names  for  different  mediums  if  we  increase  their  number  to  a  couple  of  dozens.  But  what  to  do  if  the  number  goes  into  thousands and tens of thousands?   And yet this is exactly the situation we are in today because of  softwarization.  Extrapolating  from  the  dictionary  definition  of  a  medium that opens Part 1, we can say that different mediums have  sufficiently dissimilar representational, expressive, interactive and  or communicative capacities.  How much of a difference is needed  for us to declare that we have two mediums rather than one? This  is another fundamental question that makes it challenging to use  the term “medium” in software culture.  Consider all the factors  involved in gradual and systematic expansion of these capacities:  “permanent  extendibility”  of  software;  the  development  of  new  types of computer-based and network enabled media devices  game  platforms, mobile phones, cameras, e-book readers, media players,  GPS units, digital frames, etc.  and the processes of media hybridi- zation manifested in software applications, technology prototypes,  commercial and artistic projects… Do we get a new medium every  time a new representational, expressive, interaction or communi- cation functionality is added, or is a new combination of already  existing  functions  created?  For  example,  does  the  addition  of  voice  interface  to  a  mobile  device  create  a  new  medium?  What  about  an  innovative  combination  of  different  visual  techniques  in  a  particular  music  video?  Does  this  music  video  define  a  new  medium? Or what about the versions of Google Earth that run on  a computer and support different types of layers, and the iPhone  version which in 2008 only supported Wikipedia and Panoramio  layers? Are these two different mediums?   If  we  continue  to  hold  to  our  extended  medium  definition   extrapolated  from  the  dictionary  definition ,  we  would  have  to  answer yes to all these questions. Clearly, we do not want to do this.  Which  means  that  the  conceptual  foundation  of  media  discourse   and media studies —the idea that we can name a relatively small   38 http:  www.sfmoma.org explore collection  March 6, 2012 .      SOFT  EVOLUTION    235  number  of  distinct  mediums—does  not  hold  anymore.  We  need  something else instead.    To explain this in an alternative way, when we considered only  one  aspect  of  media  ecosystem—media  design—we  were  able  to  adopt  the  traditional  understanding  of  “medium”   materials  +  tools   to  describe  the  operations  and  interfaces  of  application  software. We did this by proposing this new definition: medium =  algorithms + a data structure. Following this perspective, we can  refer to simple text, formatted text, vector graphics, bitmap images,  polygonal  3D  models,  spline-based  models,  voxel  models,  wave  audio files, MIDI files, etc. as separate mediums. But even with this  approach it was already difficult to cover the design of interactive  applications  and  websites.  When  we  start  considering  the  larger  ecosystem of the proliferating devices, network services, interface  technologies, media projects, and over one million apps for mobile  platforms  available  to  consumers,  the  concept  can  no  longer  be  stretched to describe them in a meaningful way. In this section, I  will explore one way to think beyond “medium.”   As I suggested above, the model of multiple species related via  evolutionary development that we can borrow from biology offers  a plausible alternative. This model is useful for thinking about both  media authoring editing applications and particular media projects  products  which, after all, are also software applications but more  specialized—if  media  applications  are  content  agnostic,  projects  typically offer particular content . The key advantages of a “species  model”  over  a  “mediums  model”  are  their  large  numbers   Earth  contains  many  million  species—at  least  for  now ;  their  genetic  links  which implies significant overlap in features between related  species ;  and  the  concept  of  evolution   which  implies  constant  development over time and gradually increasing diversity .    Each of these advantages is equally important. Instead of trying  to divide the extremely diverse media products of software culture  into a small number of categories  e.g. “mediums” , we can think  of each distinct combination of a particular subset of all available  techniques  as  a  unique  “media  species.”  Of  course,  a  software  application or a project product is not limited to remixing already  existing techniques; it can also introduce new one s , which may  then  reappear  in  other  applications products.  Such  new  intro- ductions  can  perhaps  be  thought  as  new  genes   keeping  in  mind  all  the  limitations  of  our  use  of  these  biological  metaphors .  If    236   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  contemporary sciences such as evolutionary biology, genetics and  neuroscience  can  describe  and  map   or  at  least,  work  towards  describing and mapping  millions of distinct species, 3 billions of  DNA  pairs  in  the  human  genome,  and  100  billion  neurons  in  a  cerebral cortex, why cannot media theory and software studies deal  with the diversity and variability of software culture by providing  richer  classifications  than  the  kinds  we  currently  use?   For  inspi- rational examples from live sciences, see the Human Connectome  Project  to  create  a  comprehensive  map  of  the  adult  brain,39  and  even more ambitious, The Blue Brain Project to create a completely  realistic software simulation of the brain, accurate on a molecular  level.40    Equally  valuable  is  the  notion  that  related  species  share  many  features. Eighteenth- to twentieth-century aesthetic tradition, from  Gotthold  Lessing  to  Clement  Greenberg,  repeatedly  insisted  on  opposing  a  small  number  of  mediums  to  each  other,  thus  seeing  them as distinct and non-overlapping categories. This trend inten- sified  in  European  modernism  of  the  1910s–1920s,  when  artists  tried to reduce every medium to its unique qualities. To do so, they  gave up representation and concentrated on the material elements  thought  to  be  unique  to  each  medium.  Poets,  such  as  Russian  futurists,  were  experimenting  with  sounds;  filmmakers  proposed  that  the  essence  of  cinema  was  movement  and  temporal  rhythm   French film theory of the 1920s41  or montage  Kuleshov’s group  in Russia ; and painters were exploring pure colors and geometric  forms.  For  example,  one  of  the  pioneers  of  abstract  art,  painter  Wassily Kandinsky, published two articles in 1919 with the titles  which clearly signal his program to articulate an artistic language  consisting only of basic geometric elements: “Small Articles About  Big Questions. I. About Point,” and “II. About Line.”42   Although  artists  in  the  second  half  of  the  twentieth  century  systematically  revolted  against  this  trend,  instead  embracing   39 http:  www.humanconnectomeproject.org about   March 7, 2012 . 40 http:  bluebrain.epfl.ch   March 7, 2012 . 41 See  Jean  Epstein,  “On  Certain  Characteristics  of  Photogénie,”  in  French  Film  Theory  and  Criticism,  ed.

SOFT  EVOLUTION    237  “mixed  media,”  “assemblage,”  “multimedia  art,”  and  “installa- tions,” this did not lead to a new, richer system for understanding  art. Instead, only a few new categories were created  e.g., the ones  I just listed , and all the extremely diverse new art objects created  by these artists were placed in these categories.    Evolutionary  biology  instead  gives  us  a  model  of  the  much  larger space of objects, which overlap in their identities. This model  fits  much  better  with  my  theory  of  software  culture  as  a  large  and continuously growing pool of techniques that can enter into  numerous combinations, in the form of applications, and projects  products  created  with  them,  or  through  custom  programming.  Obviously,  the  majority  of  these  “media  species”  share  at  least  some techniques. For example, all applications with a GUI interface  designed  to  run  on  a  full-size  computer  screen  will  use  similar  interaction techniques. To take another set of media species I have  already analyzed as examples of media hybridity, Fujihata’s Alsace,  Sauter’s Invisible Shape, and Google Earth all share a technique of  embedding videos inside a virtual navigable space. Both Fujihata  and Sauter construct unique interfaces to video objects in their 3D  worlds.  In  contrast,  Google  Earth  “inhabits”  the  YouTube  video  interface  when  you  embed  video  from  YouTube  in  a  placemark   although you have some control over the embedded player charac- teristics43 . This ability to embed the YouTube video player offers yet  another  example  of  a  technique  now  used  in  numerous  websites  and blogs; so is the use of APIs offered by most major social media  services and media sharing sites.    Finally,  another  attraction  of  the  “species  model”  is  the  idea  of  evolution—not  the  actual  mechanisms  of  biological  evolution  on Earth as theorized and argued over by scientists  because these  mechanisms  do  not  fit  technological  and  cultural  evolution ,  but  rather the image of gradual but continuous temporal development  and increased variability and speciation  emergence of new species   this idea implies—without implying progress. Without subscribing  to the theory of memes, we can name a number of ways in which  new  techniques  are  transmitted  in  software  culture:  new  projects  and products that are seen by other designers and programmers;  scientific  papers  in  computer  science,  information  science,  HCI,   43 YouTube  Help,  “Embedded  player  style  guide,”  http:  support.google.com  youtube bin answer.py?hl=en&answer=178264  March 7, 2012 .    238   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  media computing, visualization and other related fields; and also  the  code  itself.  This  last  mechanism  is  particularly  important  for  us because, in contrast to previous media, it is unique to software  culture   at  the  same  time,  it  has  a  direct  parallel  with  genetic  code . As new techniques for media editing, analysis, interaction,  transmission, retrieval, visualization, etc. become popular, they are  coded  in  multiple  programming  languages  and  scripting  environ- ments  Java, C++, JavaScript, Python, Matlab, Processing, etc.  and  become available as either commercial or, increasingly, open source  software  libraries  ready  for  download  online.  If  a  programmer  working on a new application, website, or any other media project  wants to use any of these techniques, s he can include the necessary  functions in his her own code.    Traditionally,  new  cultural  techniques  were  transmitted  via  imitation and training. Professional artists or artisans saw something  new and they imitated it; pupils, assistants, or students would learn  techniques  from  their  teachers;  art  students  would  spend  years  making  copies  of  famous  works.  In  either  case,  the  techniques  moved from mind to mind and from hand to hand. Modern media  technologies add a new mechanism for cultural transmission—the  interfaces  and  manuals  of  media  devices,  which  carry  with  them  the suggested, proper, ways of using these devices. All these mecha- nisms are at work today as well  of course, speeded up by the web .  However, they are also joined by a new one—the transmission of  cultural techniques via algorithms and software libraries.44 This does  not  necessarily  mean  that  such  transmission  does  not  introduce  changes—programmers can always modify the existing code to the  needs of their project. More important I think is the fundamental  modularity of cultural objects created via this mechanism. On the  level  of  techniques,  a  cultural  object  becomes  an  agglomeration  of  functions  drawn  from  software  libraries—the  DNA  it  shares  with  many  other  objects  that  use  the  same  techniques.   While  commercial media products also widely use content elements such  as photos purchased from stock libraries, this kind of modularity   44 Jeremy  Douglass  suggested  that  we  can  study  the  propagation  of  techniques  across  software  culture  by  tracking  the  use  of  particular  software  libraries  and  their  functions  across  programs.  Jeremy  Douglass,  presentation  at  SoftWhere  2008 workshop, University of California, San Diego, May 2008, http:  workshop. softwarestudies.com       SOFT  EVOLUTION    239  is  not  openly  acknowledged.   Because  techniques  are  coded  as  software functions, this cultural modularity is closely linked to the  principle  of  modularity  in  modern  computer  programming—the  concept that a program should contain a number of self-contained  parts. If a media project or an app introduces a new technique  or  techniques  and they appear to be valuable, often the programmers  make  them  available  as  stand-alone  functions  which  then  enter  the  overall  pool  of  all  techniques  available  within  the  computer  metamedium—and  thus  easing  the  ways  for  others  to  adopt  this  technique in creating new projects.    I would like to end this chapter by quoting the historian Louis  Menand who explains that while prior to Darwin scientists viewed  species as ideal types, Darwin shifted the focus to variation—which  for  me  is  an  overarching  reason  for  thinking  about  media  in  the  software age through the terms of evolutionary biology:  Once  our  attention  is  redirected  to  the  individual,  we  need  another  way  of  making  generalizations.  We  are  no  longer  interested  in  the  conformity  of  an  individual  to  an  ideal  type;  we  are  now  interested  in  the  relation  of  an  individual  to  the  other  individuals  with  which  it  interacts…  Relations  will  be  more important than categories; functions, which are variable,  will be more important than purposes; transitions will be more  important  than  boundaries;  sequences  will  be  more  important  than hierarchies.45   45 Louis Menand.

PART THREE  Software in action    CHAPTER FIVE  Media design  “We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us.”  Marshall McLuhan, Understanding Media  1964   After Effects and the invisible revolution  Media  hybrids  are  not  limited  to  particular  software  applica- tions, user interfaces, artistic projects, or websites. If I am right  in suggesting that hybridity represents the next logical stage in  the  development  of  computational  media,  following  the  first  stage  of  simulating  individual  physical  media  in  a  computer,  then  we  can  expect  to  find  it  in  many  cultural  areas.  And  this  is  indeed  the  case.  In  this  chapter  I  will  look  at  a  single  cultural  area  in  depth—moving  image  design—analyzing  how  the creation and aesthetics of moving images changed dramati- cally in the 1990s.   Around  the  middle  of  the  1990s,  the  simulated  physical  media  for  moving  and  still  image  production   cinematography,  animation, graphic design, typography , new computer media  3D  animation , and new computer techniques  compositing, multiple  levels of transparency  met within a single software environment— compatible software programs running on a personal workstation  or  a  personal  computer.  Filmmakers,  animators,  and  designers  started to systematically work in this environment, using software  both to generate individual elements and to assemble all elements    244   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  together.  The  result  was  the  emergence  of  a  new  visual  language  that quickly became the norm.   Today  this  language  dominates  the  visual  media  produced  in  dozens of countries. We see it daily in commercials, music videos,  TV  graphics,  film  titles,  interactive  interfaces  of  mobile  phone  and other devices, dynamic menus, animated web pages, graphics  for  mobile  media  content,  and  other  types  of  animated,  short  non-narrative  films  and  moving-image  sequences  being  produced  around  the  world  by  media  professionals  including  companies,  individual designers and artists, and students. All in all, I estimate  that at least 50 percent of short moving image works follow this  language. In this chapter I will analyze what I perceive to be some  of  its  defining  features:  new  hybrid  visual  aesthetics;  systematic  integration  of  previously  non-compatible  media  techniques;  use  of  3D  space  as  a  platform  for  media  design;  constant  change  on  every  visual  dimension;  and  amplification  of  cinematographic  techniques.   The  new  hybrid  aesthetics  exist  in  endless  variations  but  its  basic  principle  is  the  same:  juxtaposing  previously  distinct  visual  aesthetics  of  different  media  within  the  same  image.  This  is  an  example  of  how  the  logic  of  media  hybridity  restructures  a  large part of culture as a whole. The languages of design, typog- raphy,  animation,  painting,  and  cinematography  meet  within  the  computer.  Therefore,  along  with  being  a  metamedium  as  formulated by Kay, we can also call a computer a metalanguage  platform: the place where many cultural languages of the modern  period come together and begin creating new hybrids.    How  did  this  language  come  about?  I  believe  that  looking  at  the  software  involved  in  the  production  of  moving  images  goes  a long way towards explaining why they now look the way they  do. Without such analysis we will never be able to move beyond  the commonplace generalities about contemporary culture—post- modern,  global,  remix,  etc.—to  actually  describe  the  particular  languages of different design areas, to understand the causes behind  them and their evolution over time.  In other words, I think that  “software  theory,”  which  this  book  aims  to  theorize  and  put  in  practice, is not a luxury but a necessity.    Although  the  transformations  I  will  be  discussing  involved  many technological and social developments—hardware, software,  production  practices,  and  workflows,  new  job  titles  and  new       MEDIA  DESIGN    245  Opening titles animation for television series Mad Men. Imaginary  Forces, 2007.   246   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  professional  fields—it  is  appropriate  to  highlight  one  particular  software  application  which  was  at  the  center  of  the  events.  This  application  is  After  Effects.  In  this  chapter  we  will  take  a  close  look at its interface, the tools, and its typical use in media design.  Introduced in 1993, After Effects was the first software application  designed to do animation, compositing, and special effects on the  personal computer.1 Its broad effect on moving image production  can  be  compared  to  the  effects  of  Photoshop  and  Illustrator  on  photography, illustration, and graphic design.    After  Effects  certainly  has  its  competitors.  In  the  1990s,  companies also widely used more expensive “high-end” software  such  as  Flame,  Inferno,  or  Paintbox  that  run  on  specialized  graphics  workstations,  and  they  are  still  utilized  today.  In  the  2000s, other programs in the same price category as After Effects  such  as  Apple’s  Motion,  Autodesk’s  Combustion,  and  Adobe’s  Flash  have  also  challenged  After  Effects’  dominance.  However,  because of its affordability and length of time on the market After  Effects  continues  to  be  the  most  popular,  most  widely  used,  and  best-known application. Consequently, After Effects will be given  a  privileged  role  in  my  account  as  both  the  symbol  and  the  key  material foundation that made the wide-reaching transformation in  moving image culture possible.  When I searched for “best motion  graphics  software”  on  the  web  and  checked  the  answers  to  this  question on a variety of forums, the first program mentioned was  always After Effects. As one person put it on one of these forums,  “It’s pretty much the gold standard. Learn it, love it.”2 In another  example,  when  in  2012  Imaginary  Forces—the  company  most  closely associated with the rise of motion graphics in the 1990s— posted descriptions of new jobs in its Los Angeles and NYC offices     1 The  NewTek  Video  Toaster  released  in  1990  was  the  first  PC-based  video  production  system  that  included  a  video  switcher,  character  generation,  image  manipulation,  and  animation.  Because  of  their  low  costs,  Video  Toaster  systems  were extremely popular in the 1990s. In the context of this book, After Effects is  more important because, as I will explain below, it introduced a new paradigm for  moving image design that was different from the familiar video editing paradigm  supported by systems such as Toaster and Avid.   2 John  Waskey,  http:  www.quora.com What-is-the-best-software-for-creating- motion-graphics  March 4, 2001 .      MEDIA  DESIGN    247  for  designers  and  animators,  it  listed  only  one  required  software  application for 2D moving image production: After Effects.3    As  I  will  show,  After  Effects’  UI  and  tools  bring  together  fundamental  techniques,  working  methods,  and  assumptions  of  previously  separate  fields  of  filmmaking,  animation  and  graphic  design.  This  hybrid  production  environment,  encapsulated  in  a  single software application, is directly reflected in the new visual  language it enables—specifically, its focus on exploring aesthetic,  narrative, and affective possibilities of hybridization.    The shift to software-based tools in the 1990s affected not only  moving image culture but also all other areas of media design. All  of  them  adopted  the  same  type  of  production  workflow.   When  the  project  requires  many  people  and  many  media  elements,  the  production  workflow  is  called  a  “pipeline.”   In  this  workflow,  designers  typically  either  combine  elements  created  in  different  software applications, or move the whole project from one appli- cation to the next to take advantage of their unique possibilities.  And while each design field also employs its own specialized appli- cations   for  instance,  web  designers  use  Dreamweaver,  architects  use Revit, and visual effects artists use Nuke and Fusion , they also  all use a number of common applications: Photoshop, Illustrator,  Final  Cut,  After  Effects,  Maya,  3ds  Max,  and  a  few  others.   If  you use open source software like Gimp and CinePaint instead of  these commercial applications, your list of key applications will be  different, but the workflow would not change.     The adoption of a production environment and workflow that  uses  a  small  number  of  compatible  applications  in  all  areas  of  creative industries has had many fundamental effects. The profes- sional boundaries between different design fields have become less  important. A single designer or a small studio may work on a music  video today, a product design tomorrow, an architectural project  or  a  website  design  the  day  after,  and  so  on.  Another  previously  fundamental distinction—the scale of a project—also now matters  less, and sometimes not at all. Today we can expect to find exactly  the  same  shapes  and  forms  in  very  small  objects   like  jewelry ,  small  and  medium  sized  objects   tableware,  furniture ,  large  buildings, and even urban designs.  Lifestyle objects, furniture, and     3  http:  www.imaginaryforces.com jobs los-angeles designer ,  http:  www.imaginary  forces.com jobs new-york 2d-animator   October 31, 2012 .   248   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  architectural and urban design by Zaha Hadid’s office illustrate this  well.4     A comprehensive discussion of these and many other effects of  software adoption would take more than one book, and therefore  in  this  chapter  I  only  focus  on  the  impact  of  the  software-based  workflow  on  contemporary  media  design.  As  we  will  see,  this  workflow  shapes  contemporary  design  in  a  number  of  ways.  On  the one hand, never before in the history of human visual commu- nication have we witnessed such a variety of visual forms as today.  On  the  other  hand,  exactly  the  same  techniques,  compositions  and  iconography  can  now  appear  in  any  media.  To  evoke  the  metaphor  of  biological  evolution  again,  we  can  say  that  despite  seemingly  infinite  diversity  of  contemporary  media,  visual,  and  spatial “species,” they all share some common DNA. Many of the  species also share a basic design principle: integration of previously  non-compatible techniques of media design—a process which I am  going to call “deep remixability.” Thus, a consideration of media  authoring software and its usage in production would allow us to  begin  constructing  a  map  of  our  current  media design  universe,  seeing how its species are related to each other and revealing the  mechanisms behind their evolution.    The  adoption  of  After  Effects  and  related  software  in  the  second part of the 1990s quickly led to the adoption of a special  term  to  designate  new  animated  visuals  –  “motion  graphics.”  Concisely defined in 2003 by Matt Frantz in his Masters thesis as  “designed non-narrative, non-figurative based visuals that change  over time,”5 motion graphics include film and television titles, TV  graphics, dynamic menus, graphics for mobile media content, and  other  animated  sequences.  Typically  motion  graphics  appear  as  parts of longer pieces: commercials, music videos, training videos,  narrative and documentary films, interactive projects. Or at least,  this is how it was in 1993; since that time the boundary between  motion  graphics  and  everything  else  has  progressively  become  harder to define. Thus, in the 2008 version of the Wikipedia article  about motion graphics, the authors wrote that “the term ‘motion  graphics’  has  the  potential  for  less  ambiguity  than  the  use  of      4 http:  www.zaha-hadid.com    5 Matt  Frantz  “Changing  Over  Time:  The  Future  of  Motion  Graphics,”  MFA  Thesis, 2003, http:  www.mattfrantz.com thesisandresearch motiongraphics.html      MEDIA  DESIGN    249  the  term  film  to  describe  moving  pictures  in  the  21st  century.”6  Certainly,  today  numerous  short  moving  image  works  combine  live  footage,  2D  animation,  3D  animation,  and  other  techniques  equally   as  opposed  to  privileging  live  action  cinematography  as  many  feature  films  still  do ,  so  they  all  can  be  called  “motion  graphics.”    Why  did  I  select  motion  graphics  as  my  central  case  study  of  this  book,  as  opposed  to  any  other  area  of  contemporary  culture  similarly affected by either the switch to a software-based production  process,  or  native  to  computers?  The  examples  of  the  former  area  sometimes  called  “going  digital”  are  architecture,  graphic  design,  product  design,  information  design,  and  music;  the  examples  of  the  latter  area  are  game  design,  interaction  design,  user  experience  design, user interface design, web design, and interactive information  visualization.  Obviously,  most  of  the  new  design  areas  which  have  “interaction”  or  “information”  as  part  of  their  titles—and  which  emerged  since  middle  of  the  1990s  have  been  equally  ignored  by  cultural  critics,  and  therefore—demand  as  much  attention.   My  reason  has  to  do  with  the  diversity  of  new  forms—visual,  spatial,  and  temporal—that  developed  during  the  rapid  growth  of  the  motion  graphics  field  after  the  introduction  of  After  Effects.  If  we  approach  motion  graphics  in  terms  of  these  forms  and  techniques  rather than only their content , we will realize that they  represent  a  very  significant  turning  point  in  the  history  of  human  communication. Maps, pictograms, hieroglyphs, ideographs, various  scripts,  alphabet,  graphs,  projection  systems,  information  graphics,  photography,  modern  language  of  abstract  forms   developed  first  in  European  painting  in  the  1910s  and  subsequently  adopted  in  graphic  design,  product  design  and  architecture  in  the  1920s ,  the  techniques  of  twentieth-century  cinematography,  3D  computer  graphics,  and  of  course,  a  variety  of  “born  digital”  visual  effects— in  short  practically  all  communication  techniques  developed  by  humans  until  the  1990s—are  now  routinely  combined  in  motion  graphics  projects.  Thus,  almost  all  of  the  previously  separate  semiotic  resources  become  options  within  the  user’s  palette   or  “toolbox,”  to  use  the  standard  metaphor  deployed  in  media  devel- opment  software .  Linguistic,  kinetic,  spatial,  iconic,  diagrammatic,     6 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Motion_graphics   250   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  and  temporal  intelligence  can  now  work  together  to  express  what  we  already  knew  but  could  not  communicate—as  well  as  generate  new  messages  and  experiences  whose  meanings  we  have  yet  to  discover.    Although we may still need to figure out how to fully use this  new  semiotic  meta-language,  the  importance  of  its  emergence  is  hard to overestimate. In short, the emergence of software-enabled  motion  graphics  is  as  important  historically  as  the  invention  of  printing, photography, or the Internet.    We  will  begin  by  going  back  to  the  1980s.  During  the  heyday  of  post-modern  debates,  at  least  one  critic  in  America  noticed  the  connection  between  post-modern  pastiche  and  computerization.  In  his  book  After  the  Great  Divide   1986 ,  Andreas  Huyssen  wrote,  “All modern and avantgardist techniques, forms and images are now  stored  for  instant  recall  in  the  computerized  memory  banks  of  our  culture. But the same memory also stores all of pre-modernist art as  well as the genres, codes, and image worlds of popular cultures and  modern mass culture.”  7 His analysis is accurate—except that these  “computerized memory banks” did not really become commonplace  for  another  fifteen  years.  Only  when  the  Web  absorbed  enough  of  the  media  archives  did it become a  universal  cultural  memory  bank  accessible  to  all  cultural  producers.  But  even  for  the  professionals,  the ability to easily integrate multiple media sources within the same  project—multiple  layers  of  video,  scanned  still  images,  animation,  graphics, and typography—only came towards the end of the 1990s.    In  1985,  when  Huyssen’s  book  was  in  preparation  for  publi- cation,  I  was  working  for  one  of  the  few  computer  animation  companies in the world. The company was located in NYC and it  was appropriately called Digital Effects.8 Each computer animator  had his her own interactive graphics terminal that could show 3D  models but only in wireframe and monochrome; to see them fully  rendered in color, we had to take turns as the company had only  one color raster display which we all shared. The data was stored  on bulky magnetic tapes about a foot in diameter; to find the data     7 Andreas  Huyssen,  “Mapping  the  Postmodern,”  in  After  the  Great  Divide   Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1986 , p. 196.   8 Wayne  Carlson,  A  Critical  History  of  Computer  Graphics  and  Animations.  Section  2:  The  Emergence  of  Computer  Graphics  Technology,   http:  accad.osu.edu %7Ewaynec history lesson2.html      MEDIA  DESIGN    251  from an old job was a cumbersome process that involved locating  the right tape in the tape library, putting it on a tape drive and then  searching for the right part of the tape. We did not have a color  scanner, so getting “all modern and avantgardist techniques, forms  and images” into the computer was far from trivial. And even if we  had had one, there was no way to store, recall, and modify these  images. The machine that could do that—Quantel Paintbox—cost  over  $160,000,  which  we  could  not  afford.  And  when  in  1986  Quantel introduced Harry, the first commercial non-linear editing  system  that  allowed  for  digital  compositing  of  multiple  layers  of  video and special effects, its cost similarly made it prohibitive for  everybody except network television stations and a few production  houses.  Harry’s  capacities  were  quite  limited,  because  it  could  record only eighty seconds of broadcast quality video. In the realm  of still images, things were not much better: for instance, the digital  still store Picturebox released by Quantel in 1990 could hold only  500 broadcast quality images and its cost was similarly very high.   In  short,  in  the  middle  of  the  1980s  neither  we  nor  other  production  companies  had  anything  approaching  the  “comput- erized memory banks” imagined by Huyssen. And of course, the  same  was  true  for  the  visual  artists  that  were  associated  with  post-modernism  and  the  ideas  of  pastiche,  collage,  and  appro- priation.  In  1986  the  BBC  produced  a  documentary  Painting  with Light for which half a dozen well-known painters including  Richard Hamilton and David Hockney were invited to work with  the Quantel Paintbox. The resulting images were not so different  from  the  normal  paintings  that  these  artists  were  producing  without a computer. And while some artists were making reference  to  “modern  and  avantgardist  techniques,  forms  and  images,”  these  references  were  painted  rather  than  being  directly  loaded  from “computerized memory banks.” Only about ten years later,  when  relatively  inexpensive  graphics  workstations  and  personal  computers  running  image  editing,  animation,  compositing,  and  illustration  software  became  commonplace  and  affordable  for  freelance graphic designers, illustrators, and small post-production  and animation studios did the situation described by Huyssen start  to become a reality.   The  results  were  dramatic.  Within  the  space  of  less  than  five  years,  modern  visual  culture  was  fundamentally  transformed.  Visuals  which  previously  were  specific  to  different  media—live    252   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  action cinematography, graphics, still photography, animation, 3D  computer animation, and typography—started to be combined in  numerous ways. By the end of the 1990s, the “pure” moving image  media became an exception and hybrid media became the norm.  However,  in  contrast  to  other  computer  revolutions  such  as  the  rise of the World Wide Web around the same time, this revolution  was  not  acknowledged  by  popular  media  or  cultural  critics.  What  received  attention  were  the  developments  that  affected  narrative filmmaking—the use of computer-produced special effects  in  Hollywood  feature  films  or  the  inexpensive  digital  video  and  editing  tools  outside  of  it.  But  another  process  which  happened  on a larger scale—the transformation of the visual language used  by all forms of moving images outside of narrative films—has not  been critically analyzed. In fact, while the results of these transfor- mations have become fully visible by 1999, at the time of writing I  am not aware of a single theoretical article discussing them  at least  in English .    One of the reasons is that in this revolution no new media per  se were created. Just as they did ten years ago, the designers were  making still images and moving images. But the aesthetics of these  images was now very different. In fact, it was so new that, in retro- spect,  the  post-modern  imagery  of  just  ten  years  ago  that  at  the  time looked strikingly different now appears as a barely noticeable  blip on the radar of cultural history.    My choice of the starting and ending dates  1993–9  to characterize  the development of a new hybrid visual language of moving images  is not accidental. Of course, I could have picked different dates—for  instance—starting a few years earlier—but since After Effects software  which will play the key role in my account was released in 1993, I  decided to pick this year as my starting date. And while my ending  date also could have been different, I believe that by 1999 the broad  changes  in  the  aesthetics  of  moving  images  became  visible.  If  you  want to quickly see this for yourself, simply compare demo reels from  the same visual effects companies made in the early 1990s and the late  1990s  a number of them are available online—look, for instance, at  the demo reels of Pacific Data Images, or the demo reels of the Flame  system, available for every year starting in 1995.9  In work from the     9  http:  accad.osu.edu ~waynec history lesson6.html; http:  area.autodesk.com  flame20  20years.      MEDIA  DESIGN    253  beginning of the decade, computer imagery in most cases appears by  itself—that  is,  we  see  whole  commercials  and  promotional  videos  done in 3D computer animation, and the novelty of this new media is  foregrounded. By the end of the 1990s, computer animation becomes  just one element integrated in the media mix that also includes live  action, typography, and design.   Although  these  transformations  happened  only  recently,  the  ubiquity of the new hybrid visual language today is such that it takes  an effort to recall how different things looked before. Similarly, the  changes  in  production  processes  and  equipment  that  made  this  language possible also quickly fade from public and professional  memories. As a way to quickly evoke these changes as seen from the  professional perspective, I am going to quote from a 2004 interview  with Mindi Lipschultz, who has worked as an editor, producer, and  director in Los Angeles since 1979:  If you wanted to be more creative [in the 1980s], you couldn’t  just  add  more  software  to  your  system.  You  had  to  spend  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  and  buy  a  paintbox.  If  you  wanted to do something graphic—an open to a TV show with a  lot of layers—you had to go to an editing house and spend over  a thousand dollars an hour to do the exact same thing you do  now  by  buying  an  inexpensive  computer  and  several  software  programs. Now with Adobe After Effects and Photoshop, you  can do everything in one sweep. You can edit, design, animate.  You can do 3D or 2D all on your desktop computer at home or  in a small office.10  In  1989,  the  former  Soviet  satellites  of  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  peacefully  liberated  themselves  from  the  Soviet  Union.  In  the  case  of  Czechoslovakia,  this  event  came  to  be  referred  as  the  Velvet  Revolution—to  contrast  it  to  typical  revolutions  in  modern history that were always accompanied by bloodshed. To  emphasize the gradual, almost invisible pace of the transformations  which occurred in moving image aesthetics between approximately  1993  and  1999,  I  am  going  to  appropriate  the  term  the  Velvet  Revolution  to  refer  to  these  transformations.   Although  it  may   10 Mindi  Lipschultz,  interviewed  by  The  Compulsive  Creative,  May  2004,  http:   www.compulsivecreative.com interview.php?intid=12   254   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  seem  presumptuous  to  compare  political  and  aesthetics  transfor- mations simply because they share the same non-violent quality, it  is possible to show that the two revolutions are actually related.    Finally,  before  proceeding  I  should  also  explain  my  use  of  examples.  The  visual  language  I  am  analyzing  is  all  around  us  today   this  may  explain  why  academics  have  remained  blind  to  it .  After  globalization,  this  language  is  spoken  by  communi- cation professionals in dozens of countries around the world. You  can  see  for  yourself  all  the  examples  of  various  aesthetics  I  will  be  mentioning  below  by  simply  watching  television  and  paying  attention  to  graphics,  going  to  a  club  to  see  a  VJ  performance,  visiting  the  websites  of  motion  graphics  designers  and  visual  effects companies, or opening any book on contemporary design.  Nevertheless, below I have included titles of particular projects so  the reader can see exactly what I am referring to.  I have chosen  works by well-known design studies and artists so you can easily  find  all  of  them  on  the  web.   But  since  my  goal  is  to  describe  the  new  cultural  language  that  by  now  has  become  practically  universal, I want to emphasize that each of these examples can be  substituted with numerous others.   The aesthetics of hybridity  In the second half of the 1990s, one of the key identifying features  of  motion  graphics  that  clearly  separated  it  from  other  forms  of  moving image existing until that time, was the central role played  by dynamic typography. The term “motion graphics” has been used  at least since 1960, when a pioneer of computer filmmaking John  Whitney named his new company Motion Graphics. However, until  the Velvet Revolution only a handful of people and companies have  systematically explored the art of animated typography: Norman  McLaren, Saul Bass, Pablo Ferro, R Greenberg, and a few others.11  But by the middle of the 1990s moving image sequences or short   11 For  a  rare  discussion  of  motion  graphics  prehistory  as  well  as  an  equally  rare  attempt to analyze the field by using a set of concepts rather than only presenting  the portfolio of individual designers, see Jeff Bellantoni and Matt Woolman, Type  in Motion, 2nd edition  Thames & Hudson, 2004 .       MEDIA  DESIGN    255  films dominated by moving animated type and abstract graphical  elements rather than by live action, started to be produced in large  numbers. What was the material cause for motion graphics taking  off?  After  Effects  and  other  related  software  running  on  PCs  or  relatively  inexpensive  graphics  workstations  became  affordable  to smaller design, visual effects, and post-production houses, and  soon, to individual designers. Almost overnight, the term “motion  graphics” became well known.  As the Wikipedia article about this  term points out, “the term ‘Motion Graphics’ was popularized by  Trish and Chris Meyer’s book about the use of Adobe After Effects  titled  ‘Creating  Motion  Graphics.’”12   The  five-hundred-year-old  Gutenberg universe came into motion.    Along with typography, the whole language of twentieth-century  graphic design was “imported” into moving image design. While  this development did not receive a popular new name of its own,  it  is  obviously  at  least  as  important.   Although  the  term  “design  cinema” has been used, it never achieved anything comparable to  the  popularity  of  “motion  graphics.”   So  while  motion  graphics  were for years limited to film titles and therefore only used typog- raphy, today the term “motion graphics” is often used to refer to  moving  image  sequences  that  combine  moving  type  and  design  elements. But we should recall that while in the twentieth century  typography  was  often  used  in  combination  with  other  design  elements, for 500 years it commanded its own word. Therefore I  think it is important to consider the two kinds of “import” opera- tions  that  took  place  during  the  Velvet  Revolution—typography  and  twentieth  century  graphic  design—as  two  distinct  historical  developments.   While  motion  graphics  definitely  exemplify  the  changes  that  took place during the Velvet Revolution, these changes are broader.  Simply  put,  the  result  of  the  Velvet  Revolution  is  a  new  hybrid  visual language of moving images in general. This language is not  confined to particular media forms. And while today it manifests  itself most clearly in non-narrative forms, it is also often present in  narrative and figurative sequences and films.    Here  are  a  few  examples.  A  music  video  may  use  live  action  while also employing typography and a variety of transitions done   12 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Motion_graphic   256   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Sony Reader.

Another music video may  embed  the  singer  within  an  animated  painterly  space   video  for  Sheryl  Crow’s  “Good  Is  Good,”  directed  by  Psyop,  2005 .  A  commercial  may  superimpose  charts,  data  displays,  and  data  visualizations on top of live action  TV ad for Thomson Reuters  by MK12, 2012 . The title sequence may contrast 2D flat figures  and deep 3D perspectival space  titles for Mad Men by Imaginary  Forces,  2007 .  A  short  film  may  mix  typography,  stylized  3D  graphics,  animated  2D  design  elements,  and  live  action   Itsu  for  Plaid, directed by the Pleix collective, 2002 .  Sometimes, as I have  already  mentioned,  the  term  “design  cinema”  is  used  to  differ- entiate  such  short  independent  films  organized  around  design,  typography, and computer animation rather than live action from  similar “motion graphics” works produced for commercial clients.     In  some  cases,  the  juxtaposition  of  different  media  is  clearly  visible  video for “Don’t Panic” by Coldplay, 2001; titles for the  television  show  The  Inside,  2005;  commercial  “Nike  –  Dynamic  Feet,” 2005, all by Imaginary Forces . In other cases, a sequence  may  move  between  different  media  so  quickly  that  the  shifts  are  barely noticeable  GMC Denali “Holes” commercial by Imaginary  Forces, 2005 . Yet in other cases, a commercial or movie title may  feature  continuous  action  shot  on  video  or  film,  with  the  image  periodically changing from a more natural to a highly stylized look.    Such  media  hybridity  does  not  necessarily  manifest  itself  in  a  collage-like  aesthetics  that  foregrounds  the  juxtaposition  of  different media and different media techniques. As a very different  example  of  what  media  hybridity  can  result  in,  consider  a  more  subtle  aesthetics  well  captured  by  the  name  of  the  software  that  to a large extent made the hybrid visual language possible: After  Effects.  This  name  anticipated  the  changes  in  visual  effects  that  took place a number of years later. In the 1990s computers were  used  to  create  highly  spectacular  special  effects  or  “invisible  effects,”13  but  towards  the  end  of  that  decade  we  see  something   13 Invisible  effect  is  the  standard  industry  term.  For  instance,  the  film  Contact,  directed  by  Robert  Zemeckis,  was  nominated  for  the  1997  VFX  HQ  Awards  in  the following categories: Best Visual Effects, Best Sequence  The Ride , Best Shot   Powers  of  Ten ,  Best  Invisible  Effects   Dish  Restoration ,  and  Best  Compositing.  http:  www.vfxhq.com 1997 contact.html   258   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  else emerging: a new visual aesthetics that goes “beyond effects.”  In this aesthetics, the whole project—whether a music video, a TV  commercial, a short film, or a large segment of a feature film—has  a special look in which the enhancement of live-action material is  not completely invisible but at the same time does not call attention  to itself the way special effects tended to do in the 1990s  examples:  Reebok I-Pump “Basketball Black” commercial and The Legend of  Zorro main title, both by Imaginary Forces, 2005; “Fage ‘Plain’”  commercial by Psyop, 2011 .    Although the particular aesthetic solutions vary from one video  to the next and from one designer to another, they share the same  logic:  the  simultaneous  appearance  of  multiple  media  within  the  same frame. Whether these media are openly juxtaposed or almost  seamlessly blended together is less important than the fact of this  copresence itself.  Again, note that each of the examples above can  be substituted with numerous others.     Hybrid visual language is also now common to a large proportion  of  short  “experimental”  and  “independent”   i.e.,  not  commis- sioned  by  commercial  clients   videos  being  produced  for  media  festivals,  the  web,  mobile  media  devices,  and  other  distribution  platforms.14 Many visuals created by VJs and “live cinema” artists  are also hybrid, combining video, layers of 2D imagery, animation,  and abstract imagery generated in real time.15 And as the anima- tions of artists Jeremy Blake, Ann Lislegaard, and Takeshi Murata  that I will discuss below demonstrate, at least some of the works  created explicitly for art-world distribution similarly choose to use  the same language of hybridity.  14 In December 2005, I attended the Impact media festival in Utrecht and asked the  festival director what percentage of the submissions they received that year featured  hybrid  visual  language  as  opposed  to  “straight”  video  or  film.  His  estimate  was  about 50 percent. In January 2006, I was part of the review team that judged the  projects  of  students  graduating  from  SCI-ARC,  a  well-known  research-oriented  architecture  school  in  Los  Angeles.  According  to  my  informal  estimate,  approxi- mately half the projects featured complex curved geometry made possible by Maya,  a  modeling  software  now  commonly  used  by  architects.  Given  that  both  After  Effects and Maya’s predecessor, Alias, were introduced in the same year—1993—I  find this quantitative similarity in the percentage of projects that use new languages  made possible by this software quite telling.  15 For examples, consult Paul Spinrad, ed., The VJ Book: Inspirations and Practical  Advice for Live Visuals Performance  Feral House, 2005 .      MEDIA  DESIGN    259    Today,  narrative  features  rarely  mix  different  graphical  styles  within  the  same  frame.  However,  gradually  growing  number  of  films  do  feature  highly  stylized  aesthetics  that  would  have  previ- ously  been  identified  with  illustration  rather  than  filmmaking.  The  examples  are  the  Wachowski’s  Matrix  series   1999–2003 ,  Immortal by Enki Bilal  2004 , Robert Rodriguez’ Sin City  2005   and The Spirit  2008 , Zack Snyder’s 300  2007  and Watchmen   2009 ,  James  Cameron’s  Avatar   2009 ,  Tim  Burton’s  Alice  In  Wonderland   2010   and  Martin  Scorsese’s  Hugo   2011 .  These  feature  films  are  examples  of  now  fully  established  practice  to  shoot  a  large  portion  of  a  feature  film  using  a  “digital  backlot”   i.e., a green screen .16 Consequently, most or all shots in such films  are  created  by  composing  the  footage  of  actors  with  computer- generated sets and other visuals.    These films do not juxtapose their different media as dramati- cally  as  motion  graphics.  Nor  do  they  strive  for  the  seamless  integration of CGI  computer-generated imagery  visuals and live  action that characterized the earlier special-effects features of the  1990s, such as Terminator 2  1991  and Titanic  1997  by James  Cameron. Instead, they explore the space in between juxtaposition  and complete integration.    Matrix,  Sin  City,  300,  Alice  In  Wonderland,  Hugo,  and  other  films  shot  on  a  digital  backlot  combine  multiple  media  to  create  a  new  stylized  aesthetics  that  cannot  be  reduced  to  the  already  familiar  look  of  live-action  cinematography  or  3D  computer  animation.  Such  films  display  exactly  the  same  logic  as  short  motion  graphics  works,  which  at  first  sight  might  appear  to  be  very different. This logic is also the same as that which we observe  in the creation of new hybrids in biology. That is, the result of the  hybridization process is not simply a mechanical sum of the previ- ously  existing  parts  but  a  new  “species”—a  new  kind  of  visual  aesthetics that did not exist previously.   In TV commercials produced in the 2000s, this highly stylized  visual aesthetics became one of the key looks of the decade. Many  layers  of  live  footage,  3D  and  2D  animated  elements,  particle  effects, and other media elements are blended to create a seamless  whole.  This  result  has  the  crucial  codes  of  realism   perspective   16 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Digital_backlot   260   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  foreshortening,  atmospheric  perspective,  correct  combination  of  lights and shadows , but at the same time enhances visible reality.   I  cannot  call  this  aesthetics  “hyperreal”  since  the  hybrid  images  assembled from many layers and types of media look quite different  from the works of the hyperrealist artists such as Denis Peterson that  visually  look  like  standard  color  photographs.   Strong  gray-scale  contrast, high color saturation, tiny waves of particles emulating  from moving objects, extreme close-ups of textured surfaces  water  drops, food products, human skin, finishes of consumer electronics  devices,  etc. ,  the  contrasts  between  the  natural  uneven  textured  surfaces and smooth 3D renderings and 2D gradients, the rapidly  changing  composition  and  camera  position  and  direction,  and  other devices heighten our perception.  For examples of all these  strategies, you can, for example, look at the commercials made by  Psyop.17    We can say that these commercials create a “map” which is bigger  than  the  territory  being  mapped,  because  they  show  more  details  and  texture  spatially,  and  at  the  same  time  compress  time,  moving  through information more rapidly. We can also make a comparison  with the Earth observation satellites which circle the planet, capturing  its  whole  surface  in  detail  impossible  for  any  human  observer  to  see—just  as  a  human  being  cannot  simultaneously  see  the  extreme  close-up  of  the  surfaces  and  details  of  the  movements  of  objects  presented in the fictional space of a commercial.   In  summary,  the  result  of  the  shift  to  a  software  production  environment  in  moving  image  creation  is  a  new  visual  language.  Just  as  with  the  individual  software  techniques  that  make  it  possible,  this  language  as  a  whole  inherits  the  traits  of  previous  image  media—filmmaking,  cel  and  puppet  animation,  computer  animation, photography, painting, graphic design and typography.  However, it is not reducible to any of these media. Rather, it is a  true  hybrid—the  offspring  of  twentieth-century  image  mediums  that shares common traits with all of them but has its own distinct  identity.    Let us now look at two short films in detail to see how aesthetics  in hybridity works across a whole film. Blake’s Sodium Fox  2005   and Murata’s Untitled  Pink Dot   2007  offer excellent examples   17 http:  www.psyop.tv projects live-action   October 31, 2012       MEDIA  DESIGN    261  of the new hybrid visual language that currently dominates moving- image  culture.  Among  many  well-known  artists  working  with  digital moving images, Blake was the earliest and most successful  in  developing  his  own  style  of  hybrid  media.  His  video  Sodium  Fox is a sophisticated blend of drawings, paintings, 2D animation,  photography,  and  effects  available  in  software.  Using  a  strategy  commonly  employed  by  artists  in  relation  to  commercial  media  in the twentieth century, Blake slows down the fast-paced rhythm  of motion graphics as they are usually practiced today. However,  despite the seemingly slow pace of his film, it is as informationally  dense as the most frantically changing motion graphics used in clubs,  music videos, television station IDs, and so on. Sodium Fox creates  this density by exploring in an original way the basic feature of the  software-based  production  environment  in  general  and  programs  such  as  After  Effects  in  particular—namely,  the  construction  of  an image from potentially numerous layers. Of course, traditional  cel animation as practiced in the twentieth century also involved  building up an image from a number of superimposed transparent  cels, with each one containing some of the elements that together  make  up  the  whole  image.  For  instance,  one  cel  could  contain  a  face, another lips, a third hair, yet another a car, and so on.    With  computer  software,  however,  designers  can  precisely  control the transparency of each layer; they can also add different  visual effects, such as blur, between layers. As a result, rather than  creating  a  visual  narrative  based  on  the  motion  of  a  few  visual  elements  through  space   as  was  common  in  twentieth-century  animation,  both  commercial  and  experimental ,  designers  now  have many new ways to create animation. Exploring these possibil- ities, Blake crafts his own visual language in which visual elements  positioned  on  different  layers  are  continuously  and  gradually  “written  over”  each  other.  If  we  connect  this  new  language  to  twentieth-century cinema rather than to cel animation, we can say  that rather than fading in a new frame as a whole, Blake continu- ously fades in separate parts of an image. The result is an aesthetics  that  balances  visual  continuity  with  a  constant  rhythm  of  visual  rewriting, erasing, and gradual superimposition.    Like  Sodium  Fox,  Murata’s  Untitled   Pink  Dot   also  develops  its own language within the general paradigm of media hybridity.  Murata creates a pulsating and breathing image that has a distinctly  biological feel to it. In the last decade, many designers and artists    262   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Sodium Fox.

MEDIA  DESIGN    265   266   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  have used biologically inspired algorithms and techniques to create  animal-like movements in their generative animations and interac- tives. However, in the case of Untitled  Pink Dot , the image as a  whole seems to come to life.    To  create  this  pulsating,  breathing-like  rhythm,  Murata  trans- forms  live-action  footage   scenes  from  1982  movie  Rambo:  First  Blood  into a flow of abstract color patches  sometimes they look  like  oversize  pixels,  and  at  other  times  they  may  be  taken  for  artifacts  of  heavy  image  compression .  But  this  transformation  never settles into a final state. Instead, Murata constantly adjusts  its degree.  In terms of the interfaces of media software, this would  correspond  to  animating  a  setting  of  a  filter  or  an  effect.   One  moment we see almost unprocessed live imagery; the next moment  it becomes a completely abstract pattern; in the following moment,  parts of the live action image again become visible, and so on.  In Untitled  Pink Dot  the general condition of media hybridity    is realized as a permanent metamorphosis. True, we still see some  echoes  of  movement  through  space,  which  was  the  core  method  of pre-digital animation.  Here this is the movement of the figures  in the shots from Rambo.  But now the real change that matters  is the one between different media aesthetics: between the texture  of a film and the pulsating abstract patterns of flowing patches of  color, between the original “liveness” of human figures in action as  captured on film and the highly exaggerated artificial liveness they  generate when processed by a machine.    Visually, Untitled  Pink Dot  and Sodium Fox do not have much  in common. However, both films share the same strategy: creating  a  visual  narrative  through  continuous  transformations  of  image  layers,  as  opposed  to  discrete  movements  of  graphical  marks  or  characters, common to both the classic commercial animation of  Disney and the experimental classics of Norman McLaren, Oskar  Fischinger, and others. Although we can assume that neither Blake  nor Murata has aimed to achieve this consciously, in different ways  each artist stages for us the key technical and conceptual change  that defines the new era of media hybridity. Media software allows  the designer to combine any number of visual elements regardless  of their original media and to control each element in the process.  This  basic  ability  can  be  explored  in  numerous  visual  aesthetics.  The  films  of  Blake  and  Murata,  with  their  different  temporal  rhythms  and  different  logics  of  media  combination,  exemplify       MEDIA  DESIGN    267  this diversity. Blake layers various still graphics, text, animation,  and effects, dissolving elements in and out. Murata processes live  footage to create a constant image flow in which the two layers— live footage and its processed result—seem to constantly push each  other out.  Deep remixability  I believe that “media hybridity” constitutes a new fundamental stage  in the history of media. It manifests itself in different areas of software  culture and not only in moving images—although the latter does offer  a  particularly  striking  example  of  this  new  cultural  logic  at  work.  Here  the  media  authoring  software  environment  became  a  kind  of  Petri dish where the techniques and tools of computer animation, live  cinematography, graphic design, 2D animation, typography, painting  and  drawing  can  interact,  generating  new  hybrids.  And  as  the  examples above demonstrate, the results of this process of hybridity  are a new aesthetics and new “media species” that cannot be reduced  to the sum of the media that went into their creation.    Can we understand the new hybrid language of moving image as  a type of remix? From its beginnings in music culture in the 1980s,  during  the  1990s  remix  has  gradually  emerged  as  the  dominant  aesthetics  of  the  era  of  globalization,  affecting  and  re-shaping  everything from music and cinema to food and fashion.  If Fredric  Jameson once referred to post-modernism as “the cultural logic of  late capitalism,” we can perhaps call remix “the cultural logic of  networked global capitalism.”  A number of authors have already  traced remix effects in many cultural areas, ranging from children’s  use of media in Japan  Mimi Ito  to web culture  Eduardo Navas .  The  representative  books  include  Rhythm  Science   D.  J.  Spooky,  2004 ,  Remix:  Making  Art  and  Commerce  Thrive  in  the  Hybrid  Economy  Lawrence Lessig, 2008 , Mashed Up: Music, Technology,  The Rise of Configurable Culture  Aram Sinnreich, 2010 , Mashup  Cultures  edited by Stefan Sonvilla-Weiss, 2010  and Remix Theory:  The Aesthetics of Sampling  Eduardo Navas, 2012 .18  18 Mizuko Ito, “Mobilizing the Imagination in Everyday Play: The Case of Japanese  Media  Mixes,”  in  International  Handbook  of  Children,  Media,  and  Culture,    268   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND    I believe that the combinatory mechanisms responsible for the  evolution  of  the  “computer  metamedium”  in  general,  and  the  new hybrid visual aesthetics emerging in the 1990s can indeed be  considered as a type of remix—if we make one crucial distinction.  Typical remix combines content within the same media or content  from  different  media.  For  instance,  a  music  remix  may  combine  music  elements  from  any  number  of  artists;  anime  music  videos  may combine parts of anime films and music taken from a music  video. Professionally produced motion graphics and other moving- image  projects  also  routinely  mix  together  content  in  the  same  media and or from different media. For example, in the beginning  of the “Go” music video  Convert MK12 Kanye West, 2005 , the  video rapidly switches between live-action footage of a room and a  3D model of the same room. Later, the live-action shots also incor- porate a computer-generated plant and a still photographic image  of  mountain  landscape.  Shots  of  a  female  dancer  are  combined  with  elaborate  animated  typography.  The  human  characters  are  transformed into abstract animated patterns. And so on.   Such  remixes  of  content  from  different  media  are  definitely  common today in moving-image culture. In fact, I began discussing  the new visual language by pointing out that in the case of short  forms they now constitute the rule rather than the exception. But  this type of remix is only one aspect of the “hybrid revolution.”  For me its essence lies in something else. Let us call it “deep remix- ability.”  Today  designers  remix  not  only  content  from  different  media  but  also  their  fundamental  techniques,  working  methods,  and  ways  of  representation  and  expression.  United  within  the  common software environment the languages of cinematography,  animation,  computer  animation,  special  effects,  graphic  design,  typography,  drawing,  and  painting  have  come  to  form  a  new  metalanguage.  A  work  produced  in  this  new  metalanguage  can   Sonia  Livingstone  and  Kirsten  Drotner,   eds    Sage  Publications,  2008 ;  Paul  D.

MEDIA  DESIGN    269  use all the techniques, or any subset of these techniques, that were  previously unique to these different media.    We  may  think  of  this  new  metalanguage  of  moving  images  as  a  large  library  of  all  previously  known  techniques  for  creating  and  modifying  moving  images.  A  designer  of  moving  images  selects techniques from this library and combines them in a single  sequence or a single frame. But this clear picture is deceptive. How  exactly  does  s he  combine  these  techniques?  When  you  remix  content, it is easy to imagine different texts, audio samples, visual  elements, or data streams positioned side by side. Imagine a typical  twentieth-century  collage  except  that  it  now  moves  and  changes  over time. But how do you remix the techniques themselves?    In  the  cases  of  hybrid  media  interfaces  that  we  have  already  analyzed   such  as  Acrobat’s  interface ,  “remix”  of  techniques  means  simple  combination.  Different  techniques  literally  appear  next to each in the application’s UI. Thus, in Acrobat, a forward  and backward button, a zoom button, a “find” tool, and others are  positioned one after another on a toolbar above the open document.  Other techniques appear as tools listed in vertical pull-down menus:  spell, search, email, print, and so on. We find the same principles in  the interfaces of all media authoring and access applications. The  techniques borrowed from various media and the new born-digital  techniques  are  presented  side-by-side  using  tool-bars,  pull-down  menus, toolboxes and other UI design conventions.   Such an “addition of techniques” that exist in a single space side  by  side  without  any  deep  interactions  are  also  indirectly  present  in  remixes  of  content  well  familiar  to  us,  be  it  fashion  designs,  architecture, collages, or motion graphics. Consider a hypothetical  example of a visual design that combines drawn elements, photos,  and  3D  computer  graphics  forms.  Each  of  these  visual  elements  is the result of the use of particular media techniques of drawing,  photography, and computer graphics. Thus, while we may refer to  such cultural objects as remixes of content, we are also justified in  thinking about them as remixes of techniques. This applies equally  well  to  pre-digital  design,  when  a  designer  would  use  separate  physical tools or machines, and to contemporary software-driven  design, where s he has access to all these tools in a few compatible  software applications.   As long as the pieces of content, interface buttons, or techniques  are simply added rather than integrated together, we do not need a    270   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Music video for Go! By Common.

MEDIA  DESIGN    271   272   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  special term such as “deep remix.” This, for me, is still “remix” the  way this term is commonly used. But in the case of moving image  aesthetics we also encounter something else. Rather than a simple  addition,  we  also  find  interactions  between  previously  separate  techniques  of  cel  animation,  cinematography,  3D  animation,  design,  and  so  on—interactions  which  were  unthinkable  before.   The  same  argument  can  be  made  in  relation  to  other  types  of  cultural  objects  and  experiences  created  with  media  authoring  software such as visual designs and music.     I believe that this is something that neither pioneers of computer  media  of  the  1960s–1970s  nor  the  designers  of  the  first  media  authoring applications that started to appear in the 1980s intended.  However,  once  all  these  media  techniques  met  within  the  same  software  environment—and  this  was  gradually  accomplished  throughout the 1990s—they started interacting in ways that could  never have been predicted or even imagined previously.    For instance, while particular media techniques continue to be  used in relation to their original media, they can also be applied  to other media. Photoshop filters, which we previously analyzed,  illustrate well this “cross-over” effect: techniques that were origi- nally part of a particular media type can now be applied to other  media types. For instance, neon glow, stained glass, lens flare, etc.  can be applied to photographs and sketches.  More precisely, they  can  be  applied  to  whatever  is  currently  loaded  in  the  graphics  memory  and  appears  in  the  image  window—a  set  of  pixels  that  carry  the  results  of  all  previously  applied  filters  and  other  manipulations.    Here are typical examples of the crossover strategy as it is used  in  moving  image  design.  Type  is  choreographed  to  move  in  3D  space; motion blur is applied to 3D computer graphics; algorith- mically  generated  fields  of  particles  are  blended  with  live-action  footage to give them an enhanced look; a virtual camera is made  to move around a virtual space filled with 2D drawings. In each  of  these  examples,  the  technique  that  was  originally  associated  with  a  particular  medium—cinema,  cel  animation,  photorealistic  computer graphics, typography, graphic design—is now applied to  a different media type. Today a typical short film or a sequence may  combine many of such pairings within the same frame. The result  is a hybrid, intricate, complex, and rich media language—or rather,  numerous languages that share the logic of deep remixability.      MEDIA  DESIGN    273    In  fact,  such  interactions  among  virtualized  media  techniques  define the aesthetics of contemporary moving image culture. This is  why I have decided to introduce a special term—deep remixability.  I  wanted  to  differentiate  more  complex  forms  of  interactions  between techniques  such as cross over  from the simple remix  i.e.  addition  of media content and media techniques with which we  are all familiar, be it music remixes, anime video remixes, 1980s  postmodern art and architecture, and so on.    For concrete examples of the “crossover effect” which exemplifies  deep remixability, we can return to the same “Go” video and look  at  it  again,  but  now  from  a  new  perspective.  Previously  I  have  pointed  out  the  ways  in  which  this  video—typical  of  the  short  format moving images works today—combines visual elements of  different  media  types:  live  action  video,  still  photographs,  proce- durally generated elements, typography, etc. However, exactly the  same shots also contain rich examples of the interactions between  techniques,  which  are  only  possible  in  a  software-driven  design  environment.    As  the  video  begins,  a  structure  made  up  from  perpendicular  monochrome  blocks  and  panels  simultaneously  grows  rapidly  in  space  and  rotates  to  settle  into  a  position  which  allows  us  to  recognize  it  as  a  room   00:07–00:11 .  As  this  move  is  being  completed,  the  room  is  transformed  from  an  abstract  geometric  structure  into  a  photo-realistically  rendered  one:  furniture  pops  in,  wood  texture  rolls  over  the  floor  plane,  and  a  photograph  of  a  mountain view fills a window. Although such different styles of CG  rendering have been available in animation software since the 1980s,  a  particular  way  in  which  this  video  opens  with  a  visually  striking  abstract monochrome 3D structure is a clear example of deep remix- ability.  When  in  the  middle  of  the  1990s  graphic  designers  started  to  use  computer  animation  software,  they  brought  their  training,  techniques,  and  sensibilities  to  computer  animation  that  until  that  time  was  used  in  the  service  of  photorealism.  The  strong  diagonal  compositions, the deliberately flat rendering, and the choice of colors  in  the  opening  of the  “Go”  video  subordinates  CG  photorealistic  techniques  to  a  visual  discipline  specific  to  modern  graphic  design.  The animated 3D structure references the Suprematism of Malevich  and  Lissitzky,  which  played  a  key  role  in  shaping  the  grammar  of  modern  design—and  which,  in  our  example,  has  become  a  conceptual “filter” that has transformed the CG field.   274   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND    After a momentary stop to let us take in the room, which is now  largely completed, a camera suddenly rotates 90 degrees  00:15 –  00:17 . This physically impossible camera move is another example  of  deep  remixability.  While  animation  software  implements  the  standard  grammar  of  twentieth-century  cinematography—a  pan,  a zoom, a dolly, etc.—the software, of course, does not have the  limitations of a physical world. Consequently a camera can move  in an arbitrary direction, follow any imaginable curve and do this  at any speed. Such impossible camera moves become standard tools  of contemporary media design and twenty-first-century cinematog- raphy, appearing with increased frequency in feature films since the  middle of the 2000s. Just as Photoshop filters which can be applied  to any visual composition, virtual camera moves can also be super- imposed, so to speak, on any visual scene regardless of whether it  was constructed in 3D, procedurally generated, captured on video,  photographed, or drawn—or, as in the example of the room from  “Go” video, is a combination of these different media.    Playing the video forward  00:15–00:22 , we notice yet another  previously  impossible  interaction  between  media  techniques.  The  interaction  in  question  is  a  lens  reflection,  which  is  slowly  moving across the whole scene. Originally an artifact of a camera  technology, lens reflection was turned into a filter—i.e., a technique  which can now be “drawn” over any image constructed with all  other  techniques  available  to  a  designer.   This  important  type  of  software technique, one which originated as artifacts of physical or  electronic media technologies, will be discussed in more details in  the concluding section of this chapter.  If you wanted more proof  that  we  are  dealing  here  with  a  visual  technique,  note  that  this  “lens reflection” is moving while the camera remains perfectly still   00:17–00:22 —a logical impossibility, which is sacrificed in favor  of a more dynamic visual experience.    I referred to the new language of moving imagery as a “meta- language.”  Since  our  discussion  has  so  far  relied  on  the  term  “computer metamedium,” I should explain the connection between  these two terms.   The  acceleration  of  the  speed  of  social,  technological  and  cultural  change  in  the  second  part  of  the  twentieth  century  has  led to the frequent use of ‘meta-,’ ‘hyper-,’ and ‘super-’ in cultural  theory  and  criticism.  From  Superstudio   a  conceptual  architec- tural  group  active  in  the  1960s ,  Ted  Nelson’s  Hypermedia  and       MEDIA  DESIGN    275  Alan Kay’s metamedium to the more recent Supermodernism and  Hypermodernity,19 these terms may be read as attempts to capture  the  feeling  that  we  have  passed  a  point  of  singularity  and  are  now  moving  at  warp  speed.  Like  the  cosmonauts  of  the  1960s  observing the Earth from the orbits of their spaceships and seeing  it  for  the  first  time  as  a  single  object,  we  are  looking  down  at  human  history  from  a  new  higher  orbit.  This  connotation  seems  to fit Alan Kay’s conceptual and practical redefinition of a digital  computer  as  a  metamedium  that  contains  most  existing  medium  technologies  and  techniques  and  also  allows  invention  of  many  new ones.    While the term “metalanguage” has precise meanings in logic,  linguistics, and computing, here I am using it in a sense similar to  Alan Kay’s use of “meta” in “computer metamedium.” Normally  a “metalanguage” refers to a separate formal system for describing  mediums or cultural languages—the way grammar describes how  a  particular  natural  language  works.  But  this  not  how  Kay  uses  “meta”  in  “metamedium.”  As  he  uses  it,  it  stands  for  gathering  including collecting—in short, bringing previously separate things  together.    Let  us  imagine  this  computer  metamedium  as  a  large  and  continuously  expanding  set  of  resources.  It  includes  all  media  creation manipulation techniques, interaction techniques and data  formats  available  to  programmers  and  designers  in  the  current  historical moment. Everything from sort and search algorithms and  pull-down  menus  to  hair  and  water  rendering  techniques,  video  games AI, and multi-touch interface methods—it is all there.    If we look at how these resources are used in different cultural  areas  to  create  particular  kinds  of  content  and  experiences,  we  will  see  that  each  of  them  only  uses  a  subset  of  these  resources.  For example, the graphical interfaces of today’s popular computer  operating systems  Windows, Linux, Mac OS  use static icons. In  contrast, in some consumer electronics interfaces  such as certain  mobile phones  all icons are animated loops.    Moreover,  the  use  of  a  subset  of  all  existing  elements  is  not  random but follows particular conventions. Some elements always  go together. In other cases, the use of one element means that we   19 http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Hypermodernity   276   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  are unlikely to find some other element. In other words, different  forms of digital media use different subsets from a complete set of  techniques  contained  in  a  computer  metamedium—and  this  use  follows distinct patterns.    If you notice the parallels with what cultural critics usually call  an “artistic language,” a “style,” or a “genre,” you are right. Any  single work of literature or works of a particular author or literary  movement uses only some of the existing literary techniques, and this  use follows some patterns. The same goes for cinema, music and all  other recognized cultural forms. This allows us to talk about a style  of a particular novel or film, a style of an author as a whole, or a  style of a whole artistic school.  Film scholars David Bordwell and  Kristin Thompson call this a “stylistic system” which they define as  a “patterned and significant use of techniques.” For cinema, they  divide these techniques into four categories: mise-en-scène, cinema- tography,  editing,  and  sound.20   When  a  whole  cultural  field  can  be divided into a small number of distinct groups of works with  each group sharing some patterns, we usually talk about “genres.”  For instance, theoreticians of Ancient Greek theatre distinguished  between comedies and tragedies and prescribed the rules each genre  should  follow,  while  today  companies  use  automatic  software  to  classify blogs into different genres.    If by medium we mean a set of standard technological resources,  be  it  a  physical  stage  or  a  film  camera,  lights  and  film  stock,  we  can  see  that  each  medium  usually  supports  multiple  artistic  languages styles genres.  For  example,  a  medium  of  twentieth- century  filmmaking  supported  Russian  Montage  of  the  1920s,  Italian Neorealism of the 1940s, French New Wave of the 1960s,  Hong  Kong  fantasy  Kung  Fu  films  of  the  1980s,  Chinese  “fifth- generation” films of the 1980s–1990s, etc.    Similarly, a computer metamedium can support multiple cultural  or  artistic  metalanguages.  In  other  words,  in  the  theoretical  scheme I am proposing, there is only one metamedium—but many  metalanguages.    So what is a metalanguage? If we define an artistic language as  a patterned use of a selected number of a subset of the techniques   20 David  Bordwell  and  Kristin  Thompson,  Film  Art:  an  Introduction,  5th  edition   The McGraw-Hill Companies, 1997 , p. 355.      MEDIA  DESIGN    277  available  in  a  given  medium,21  a  metalanguage  is  a  patterned  use  of  a  subset  of  all  the  techniques  available  in  a  computer  metamedium. But not just any subset. It only makes sense to talk  about a metalanguage  as opposed to a language  if the techniques  it  uses  come  from  previously  distinct  cultural  languages.  As  an  example, consider a metalanguage of popular commercial virtual  globes   Google  Earth,  Microsoft  Bing  Maps .  These  applica- tions systematically combine different types of media formats and  media navigation techniques that previously were separate. These  combinations follow common patterns. Another example will be a  metalanguage common to many graphical interface users  recall my  analysis of Acrobat’s interface, which combines metaphors drawn  from different media traditions .    Since  moving  images  today  systematically  combine  techniques  of  different  visual  media  that  almost  never  met  until  middle  of  the  1990s,  we  are  justified  in  using  the  term  “metalanguage”  in  their case. Visual design today has its own metalanguage, itself is  a subset of the metalanguage of moving images. The reason is that  a designer of moving images has access to all the techniques of a  visual  designer  plus  extra  techniques  since  s he  is  working  with  additional dimension of time. These two metalanguages also largely  overlap in patterns that are common to them—but there are some  important  differences.  For  instance,  today’s  moving  image  works  often feature a continuous movement through a 3D space that may  contain various 2D elements. In contrast, visual designs for print,  web, products, or other applications are usually two-dimensional— they assemble elements over an imaginary flat surface.  I think that  the main reason for this insistence on flatness is that these designs  often exist next to large blocks of text that already exist in 2D.   Layers, transparency, compositing  So far I have focused on describing the aesthetics of moving images  that  emerged  from  the  Velvet  Revolution.  While  continuing  this  investigation, we will now pay more attention to an analysis of the  new  software  production  environment  that  made  this  aesthetics   21 This definition is adopted from Bordwell and Thompson, Film Art, p. 355.   278   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  possible.  The  following  sections  of  this  chapter  will  look  at  the  tools offered by After Effects and other media authoring applica- tions,  their  user  interfaces,  and  the  ways  these  applications  are  used  together  in  production   i.e.  design  workflow .  Rather  than  discussing  all  the  tools  and  interface  features,  I  will  highlight  a  number  of  fundamental  assumptions  behind  them—ways  of  understanding what a moving image project is—which, as we will  see,  are  quite  different  from  how  it  was  understood  during  the  twentieth century.    Probably most dramatic among the changes that took place during  1993–99 was the new ability to combine multiple levels of imagery  with varying degrees of transparency via digital compositing. If you  compare a typical music video or a TV advertising spot circa 1986  with  its  counterpart  circa  1996,  the  differences  are  striking.   The  same holds for other areas of visual design.  As I have already noted,  in  1986  “computerized  memory  banks”  were  very  limited  in  their  storage capacity and prohibitively expensive, and therefore designers  could not quickly and easily cut and paste multiple image sources. But  even when they could assemble multiple visual references, a designer  only could place them next to, or on top of each other. S he could  not modulate these juxtapositions by precisely adjusting transparency  levels  of  different  images.  Instead,  s he  had  to  resort  to  the  same  photo-collage  techniques  popularized  in  the  1920s.  In  other  words,  the  lack  of  transparency  restricted  the  number  of  different  image  sources that could be integrated within a single composition without  it  starting  to  look  like  certain  photomontages  or  photo-collages  of  John Heartfield, Hannah Hoch, or Robert Rauschenberg—a mosaic  of fragments without any strong dominant.22    In addition to allowing the superimposition of many transparent  layers, digital compositing  also  made  trivial  another  operation  that  was  previously  very  cumbersome.  Until  the  1990s,  different  media  types  such  as  hand-drawn  animation,  lens-based  recordings,  and  typography  practically  never  appeared  within  the  same  frame.  Instead, animated commercials, publicity shorts, industrial films, and  some feature and experimental films that did include multiple media   22 In  the  case  of  video,  one  of  the  things  that  made  combining  multiple  visuals  difficult was the rapid degradation of the video signal when an analog video tape  was copied more than a couple of times. Such a copy would no longer meet broad- casting standards.       MEDIA  DESIGN    279  usually placed them in separate shots. A few directors have managed  to  build  whole  aesthetic  systems  out  of  such  temporal  juxtaposi- tions—most  notably,  Jean-Luc  Godard.  In  his  1960s  films  such  as  Weekend   1967   Godard  cut  bold  typographic  compositions  in  between live action creating what can be called a “media montage”   as  opposed  to  a  montage  of  live  action  shots,  as  developed  by  the  Russians  in  the  1920s .  Also in the  1960s,  pioneering  motion  graphics designer Pablo Ferro, who appropriately called his company  Frame  Imagery,  created  promotional  shorts  and  TV  graphics  that  played  on  juxtapositions  of  different  media  replacing  each  other  in  rapid  succession.23  In  a  number  of  Ferro’s  spots,  static  images  of  different  letterforms,  line  drawings,  original  hand-painted  artwork,  photographs,  very  short  clips  from  newsreels,  and  other  visuals  come one after another with machine gun speed.    Within  cinema,  the  superimposition  of  different  media  within  the same frame was usually limited to the two media placed on top  of each other in a standardized manner—i.e. static letters appearing  on  top  of  still  or  moving  lens-based  images  in  feature  film  titles.  In  the  1960s,  both  Ferro  and  another  motion  graphics  pioneer  Saul Bass created a few remarkable title sequences in which visual  elements  of  different  origin  were  systematically  overlaid  together  more  dynamically—such  as  the  opening  for  Hitchcock’s  Vertigo  designed by Bass  1958 .  Bass’s 1959 title sequence for North by  Northwest is considered to be the first to use type in motion .   But I think it is fair to say that such complex juxtapositions of  media within the same frame were rare exceptions in the otherwise  “unimedia”  universe,  where  filmed  images  appeared  in  feature  films and hand-drawn images appeared in animated films. The only  twentieth-century  feature  film  director  I  know  of  who  has  built  his unique aesthetics by systematically combining different media  within the same frame was Karel Zeman. Thus, a typical shot by  Zeman may contain filmed human figures, an old engraving used  for background, and a miniature model.24    The achievements of these directors and designers are particu- larly remarkable given the difficulty of combining different media   23 Jeff Bellantoni and Matt Woolman, Type in Motion  Rizzoli, 1999 , pp. 22–9. 24 While special effects in feature films often combined different media, they were  used together to create a single illusionistic space, rather than juxtaposed for the  aesthetic effect such as in films and titles by Godard, Zeman, Ferro, and Bass.   280   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  within  the  same  frame  during  the  film  era.  To  do  this  required  utilizing  the  services  of  special  effects  departments  or  separate  companies which used optical printers. Techniques that were cheap  and more accessible, such as double exposure, were limited in their  precision.  So  while  a  designer  of  static  images  could  at  least  cut  and paste multiple elements within the same composition to create  a  photomontage,  to  produce  the  equivalent  effect  with  moving  images was far from trivial.   To put this in more general terms, we can say that before the  computerization  of  the  1990s,  the  designer’s  capacities  to  access,  manipulate,  remix,  and  filter  visual  information,  whether  still  or  moving,  were  quite  restricted.  In  fact,  they  were  practically  the  same as a hundred years earlier—regardless of whether filmmakers  and  designers  used  in-camera  effects,  optical  printing,  or  video  keying. In retrospect, we can see they were at odds with the flexi- bility, speed, and precision of data manipulation that was already  available to most other by then computerized professional fields— sciences,  engineering,  accounting,  management,  etc.  Therefore  it  was only a matter of time before all image media would be turned  into digital data and illustrators, graphic designers, animators, film  editors, video editors, and motion graphics designers would start to  manipulate them via software instead of their traditional tools. But  this is only obvious today—after the Velvet Revolution has taken  place.   In  1985  Jeff  Stein  directed  a  music  video  for  the  single  “You  Might Think” by new wave band The Cars. This video was one  of  the  first  to  systematically  use  computer  graphics;  it  had  a  big  impact in the design world, and MTV gave it the first prize in its  first annual music awards. Stein managed to create a surreal world  in which a video cutout of the singing head of the band member was  animated over different video backgrounds. In other words, Stein  took the aesthetics of animated cartoons—2D animated characters  superimposed over a 2D background—and recreated it using video  imagery.  In  addition,  simple  computer  animated  elements  were  also  added  in  some  shots  to  enhance  the  surreal  effect.  This  was  shocking because no one had ever seen such juxtapositions before.  Suddenly, modernist photomontage came alive. But ten years later,  such moving video collages became not only commonplace—they  also became more complex, more layered, and more subtle. Instead  of  two  or  three,  a  composition  could  now  feature  hundreds  and       MEDIA  DESIGN    281  even thousands of layers. And each layer could have its own level  of transparency. In  short,  digital  compositing  now  allowed  the  designers  of    moving  images  to  easily  combine  any  number  of  visual  elements  regardless  of  the  media  in  which  they  originated  and  to  control  each  element  in  the  process.  I  can  make  an  analogy  between  multitrack audio recording and digital compositing. In multitrack  recording,  each  sound  track  can  be  manipulated  individually  to  produce  the  desired  result.  Similarly,  in  digital  compositing  each  visual  element  can  be  independently  modulated  in  a  variety  of  ways: resized, recolored, animated, etc. Just as the music artist can  focus on a particular track while muting all other tracks, a designer  often  turns  of  all  visual  tracks  except  the  one  s he  is  currently  adjusting. Similarly, both a music artist and a designer can at any  time substitute one element of a composition by another, delete any  elements, and add new ones. Most importantly, just as multitrack  recording  redefined  the  sound  of  popular  music  from  the  1970s  onward, once digital compositing became widely available during  the 1990s it fundamentally changed the visual aesthetics of most  moving images forms.    This  discussion  only  scratched  the  surface  of  my  subject  in  this  section:  layers  and  transparency.  For  instance,  I  have  not  analyzed  the  actual  techniques  of  digital  compositing  and  the  fundamental  concept  of  an  alpha  channel,  which  deserves  a  separate  and  detailed  treatment.  I  have  also  not  gone  into  the  possible  media  histories  leading  to  digital  compositing  nor  examined  its  relationship  to  optical  printing,  video  keying,  and  video  effects  technology  of  the  1980s.  These  histories  and  relationships  were  discussed  in  the  “Compositing”  chapter  in  The  Language  of  New  Media  but  from  a  different  perspective  than  the  one  used  here.  At  that  time   1999   I  was  looking  at  compositing from the point of view of the questions of cinematic  realism,  practices  of  montage,  and  the  construction  of  special  effects in feature films. Today, however, it is clear to me that in  addition to disrupting the regime of cinematic realism in favor  of  other  visual  aesthetics,  compositing  also  had  another,  even  more fundamental effect.    By  the  end  of  the  1990s  digital  compositing  had  become  the  basic operation used in creating all forms of moving images, and  not only big budget features. So while it was originally developed    282   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  as a technique for special effects in the 1970s and early 1980s,25  compositing  had  a  much  broader  effect  on  contemporary  visual  and media cultures beyond special effects. Compositing played the  key role in turning the digital computer into a kind of experimental  lab  or a Petri dish  where different media can meet and where their  aesthetics and techniques can be combined to create new species.  In  short,  digital  compositing  was  essential  in  enabling  the  devel- opment of a new hybrid visual language of moving images—one  that today we see everywhere.    Defined  at  first  as  a  particular  digital  technique  designed  to  integrate the two media of live action film and computer graphics  in special effects sequences, compositing later became a “universal  media  integrator.”  And  although  compositing  was  originally  created to support the aesthetics of cinematic realism, over time it  actually had an opposite effect. Rather than forcing different media  to fuse seamlessly, compositing led to the flourishing of numerous  media hybrids where the juxtapositions between live and algorith- mically generated, two dimensional and three dimensional, raster  and  vector  media  are  made  deliberately  visible  rather  than  being  hidden.   After Effects interface: from “time-based”   to “composition-based”  My thesis about media hybridity applies both to the cultural objects  and  the  software  used  to  create  them.  Just  as  the  moving  image  media made by designers today mix the formats, assumptions, and  techniques of different media, the toolboxes and interfaces of the  software they use are also remixes. Let us again use After Effects as  the case study to see how its interface remixes previously distinct  working methods of different disciplines.    When  moving  image  designers  started  to  use  compositing  animation software such as After Effects, its interface encouraged  them to think about moving images in a fundamentally new way.  Film  and  video  editing  systems  and  their  computer  simulations   25 Thomas Porter and Tom Duff, “Compositing Digital Images,” ACM Computer  Graphics 18, no. 3  July 1984 : pp. 253–9.      MEDIA  DESIGN    283  that came to be known as non-linear editors  currently exemplified  by Avid, Premiere, and Final Cut26  have conceptualized a media  project  as  a  sequence  of  shots  organized  in  time.  Consequently,  while NLE  the standard abbreviation for non-linear video editing  software  gave the editor many tools for adjusting the edits, they  took for granted the constant of a film language that came from  its industrial organization—that all frames have the same size and  aspect ratio. This is an example of a larger trend. During the first  stage  of  the  development  of  cultural  software,  its  pioneers  were  exploring the new possibilities of a computer metamedium going  in any direction they were interested, since commercial use  with  a  notable  exception  of  CAD   was  not  yet  an  option.  However,  beginning with the 1980s, a new generation of companies—Aldus,  Autodesk,  Macromedia,  Adobe,  and  others—started  to  produce  GUI-based software media authoring software aimed at particular  industries:  TV  production,  graphic  design,  animation,  etc.  As  a  result, many of the workflow principles, interface conventions and  constraints of media technologies standard in these industries, were  methodically  re-created  in  software—even  though  the  software  medium itself has no such limitations. NLE software is a case in  point.  In  contrast,  from  the  beginning  the  After  Effects  interface  put  forward  a  new  concept  of  moving  image  as  a  composition  organized both in time and 2D space.    The center of After Effects’ interface is a Composition concep- tualized  as  a  large  canvas  that  acts  as  a  background  for  visual  elements which can have arbitrary sizes, proportions, and content   video,  photos,  abstract  graphics,  type,  etc .  When  I  first  started  using  After  Effects  soon  after  it  came  out,  I  remember  feeling  shocked that the software did not automatically resize the graphics  I  dragged  into  the  Composition  window  to  make  them  fit  the  overall frame. The fundamental assumption of cinema that accom- panied it throughout its whole history—that film consists of many  frames which all have the same size and aspect ratio—was gone.    In film and video editing paradigms of the twentieth century, the  minimal unit on which the editor works is a frame. S he can change  the length of an edit, adjusting where one film or video segment ends   26 Compositing functionality was gradually added over time to most NLE systems,  so today the distinction between Effects or Flame interfaces and Avid and Final Cut  interfaces is less pronounced.   284   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  “The center of After Effects interface is a Composition conceptualized  as a large canvas that acts as a background for visual elements which  can have arbitrary sizes, proportions, and content. Each element can  be individually accessed, manipulated, and animated.” The illustration  shows selected frames from a simple 2D animation, as they appear in the  Composition panel.      MEDIA  DESIGN    285  and another begins, but s he cannot directly modify the contents of  a frame. The frame functions as a kind of “black box” that cannot  be “opened.”  This was the job for special effects departments and  companies.  But in the After Effects interface, the basic unit is not a  frame but a visual element placed in the Composition window. Each  element can be individually accessed, manipulated, and animated.  In other words, each element is conceptualized as an independent  object.  Consequently,  a  media  composition  is  understood  as  a  set  of  independent  objects  that  can  change  over  time.  The  very  word  “composition”  is  important  in  this  context  as  it  references  2D  media   drawing,  painting,  photography,  design   rather  than  filmmaking—i.e. space as opposed to time.    Where  does  the  After  Effects  interface  come  from?  Given  that  this  software  is  commonly  used  to  create  animated  graphics  and  visual  effects,  it  is  not  surprising  that  its  interface  elements  can  be  traced  to  three  separate  fields:  animation,  graphic  design,  and  special  effects.  And  because  these  elements  are  integrated  in  intricate  ways  to  offer  the  user  a  new  experience  that  cannot  be  simply reduced to a sum of the working methods already available  in separate fields, it makes sense to think of the After Effects UI as  an example of “deep remixability.”    In  twentieth-century  cel  animation  production,  an  animator  places a number of transparent cels on top of each other. Each cel  contains a different drawing—for instance, a body of a character on  one cel, the head on another cel, eyes on the third cel. Because the  cels are transparent, the drawings get automatically “composited”  into a single composition. While the After Effects interface does not  use the metaphor of a stack of transparent cels directly, it is based  on the same principle. Each element in the Composition window is  assigned a “virtual depth” relative to all other elements. Together  all  elements  form  a  virtual  stack.  At  any  time,  the  designer  can  change the relative position of an element within the stack, delete  it, or add new elements.    We can also see a connection between the After Effects interface  and another popular twentieth-century animation technique—stop  motion.  To  create  stop  motion  shots,  puppets  or  any  other  3D  objects  are  positioned  in  front  of  a  film  camera  and  manually  animated  one  step  at  a  time.  For  instance,  an  animator  may  be  adjusting  the  head  of  a  character,  progressively  moving  it  from  left to right in small discrete steps. After every step, the animator    286   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  exposes one frame of film, then makes another adjustment, exposes  another  frame,  and  so  on.   The  twentieth-century  animators  and  filmmakers who used this technique with great inventiveness include  Wladyslaw  Starewicz,  Oskar  Fischinger,  Aleksandr  Ptushko,  Jiří  Trnka, Jan Svankmajer, and the Brothers Quay.     Just as in cel and stop-motion animation practices, After Effects  does  not  make  any  assumptions  about  the  size  or  positions  of  individual elements. Instead of dealing with standardized units of  time—i.e. film frames containing fixed visual content—a designer  now  works  with  separate  visual  elements.  An  element  can  be  a  digital  video  frame,  a  line  of  type,  an  arbitrary  geometric  shape,  etc.  The  finished  work  is  the  result  of  a  particular  arrangement  of  these  elements  in  space  and  time.  Consequently,  a  designer  who uses After Effects can be compared to a choreographer who  creates a dance by “animating” the bodies of dancers—specifying  their entry and exit points, their trajectories through the space of  the  stage,  and  the  movements  of  their  bodies.   In  this  respect  it  is relevant that although the After Effects interface did not evoke  this reference, another equally important 1990s software that was  commonly used to design multimedia—Macromedia Director—did  explicitly refer to the metaphor of the theatre stage in its UI.     While  we  can  link  the  After  Effects  interface  to  traditional  animation  methods  as  used  by  commercial  animation  studios,  the working method put forward by software is closer to graphic  design. In commercial animation studios of the twentieth century  all  elements—drawings,  sets,  characters,  etc.—were  prepared  beforehand.  The  filming  itself  was  a  mechanical  process.  Of  course, we can find exceptions to this industrial-like separation of  labor in experimental animation practice where a film was usually  produced  by  one  person.  This  allowed  a  filmmaker  to  invent  a  film  as  he  went  along,  rather  than  having  to  plan  everything  beforehand. A classic example of this is Oskar Fischinger’s Motion  Painting  1  created  in  1949.  Fischinger  made  this  11-minute  film  by continuously modifying a painting and exposing film one frame  at a time after each modification. This process took nine months.  Because Fischinger was shooting on film, he had to wait a long time  before seeing the results of his work. As the historian of abstract  animation  William  Moritz  writes,  “Fischinger  painted  every  day  for over five months without being able to see how it was coming  out on film, since he wanted to keep all the conditions, including       MEDIA  DESIGN    287  film  stock,  absolutely  consistent  in  order  to  avoid  unexpected  variations in quality of image.”27 In other words, in the case of this  project by Fischinger, creating animation and seeing the result were  even more separated than in a commercial animation process.    In  contrast,  a  graphic  designer  works  “in  real  time.”  As  the  designer  introduces  new  elements,  adjusts  their  locations,  colors  and  other  properties,  tries  different  images,  changes  the  size  of  the type, and so on, s he can immediately see the result of his her  work.28  After  Effects  adopts  this  working  method  by  making  the  Composition window the center of its interface. Like a traditional  designer, the After Effects user interactively arranges the elements in  this window and can immediately see the result. In short, the After  Effects interface makes filmmaking into a design process, and a film  is re-conceptualized as a graphic design that can change over time.    As we saw when we looked at the history of cultural software,  when physical or electronic media are simulated in a computer, we  do not simply end up with the same media as before. By adding  new properties and working methods, computer simulation funda- mentally  changes  the  identity  of  a  given  media.  For  example,  in  the case of “electronic paper” such as a Word document or a PDF  file, we can do many things which were not possible with ordinary  paper: zoom in and out of the document, search for a particular  phrase, change fonts and line spacing, etc. Similarly, online inter- active maps services provided by Google and Microsoft augment  the traditional paper map in multiple and amazing ways.   A significant proportion of contemporary software for creating,  editing,  and  interacting  with  media  was  developed  in  this  way.   27 Quoted in Michael Barrier, Oskar Fischinger. Motion Painting No. 1, http:  www. michaelbarrier.com Capsules Fischinger fischinger_capsule.htm 28 Depending  on  the  complexity  of  the  project  and  the  hardware  configuration,  the  computer  may  or  may  not  be  able  to  keep  pace  with  the  designer’s  changes.  Often a designer has to wait until the computer renders everything in frame after  s he  makes  changes.  However,  since  s he  has  control  over  this  rendering  process,  s he  can  instruct  After  Effects  to  show  only  outlines  of  the  objects,  to  skip  some  layers, etc.—thus giving the computer less information to process and allowing for  real-time feedback. While a graphic designer does not have to wait until a film is  developed or a computer has finished rendering the animation, the design has its  own “rendering” stage—making proofs. With both digital and offset printing, after  the design is finished, it is sent to the printer who produces the test prints. If the  designer  finds  any  problems  such  as  incorrect  colors,  s he  adjusts  the  design  and  then asks for proofs again.    288   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Already existing media technologies were simulated in a computer  and  augmented  with  new  properties.  But  if  we  consider  media  authoring  software  such  as  Maya   3D  modeling  and  computer  animation   or  After  Effects   motion  graphics,  compositing  and  visual  effects ,  we  encounter  a  different  logic.  These  software  applications do not simulate any single physical media that existed  previously.  Rather,  they  borrow  from  a  number  of  different  media, combining and mixing their working methods and specific  techniques.  And, of course, they also add new capabilities specific  to computers—for instance, the ability to automatically calculate  the  intermediate  values  between  a  number  of  key  frames.   For  example,  3D  modeling  software  mixes  form-making  techniques  which  were  previously  “hardwired”  to  different  physical  media:  the ability to change the curvature of a rounded form as though it  were made from clay, the ability to build a complex 3D object from  simple  geometric  primitives  the  way  buildings  were  constructed  from identical rectangular bricks, cylindrical columns, pillars, etc.    Similarly, as we saw, the After Effects original interface, toolkit,  and workflow draws upon the techniques of animation and graphic  design.  We can also find traces of filmmaking and 3D computer  graphics.   But  the  result  is  not  simply  a  mechanical  sum  of  all  elements that came from earlier media. Rather, as software remixes  the  techniques  and  working  methods  of  the  various  media  they  simulate, the results are new interfaces, tools, and workflows with  their own distinct logic. In the case of After Effects, the working  method  that  it  puts  forward  is  neither  animation  nor  graphic  design  nor  cinematography,  even  though  it  draws  from  all  these  fields. It is a new way to make moving image media. Similarly, the  visual language of media produced with this and similar software  is also different from the languages of moving images that existed  previously.   Consequently, the Velvet Revolution unleashed by After Effects  and  other  software  did  not  simply  make  more  commonplace  the  animated graphics that artists and designers such as John and James  Whitney, Norman McLaren, Saul Bass, Robert Abel, Harry Marks,  Richard and Robert Greenberg were previously creating using stop  motion animation, optical printing, video effects hardware of the  1980s,  and  other  custom  techniques  and  technologies.  Instead  it  led  to  the  emergence  of  numerous  new  visual  aesthetics  that  did  not exist before. And if the common feature of these aesthetics is       MEDIA  DESIGN    289  “deep remixability,” it is not hard to see that it mirrors the “deep  remixability” in the After Effects UI.  3D space as a media design platform  As I was researching what users and industry reviewers had been  saying about After Effects, I came across a somewhat condescending  characterization of this software as “Photoshop with keyframes.”  I  think  that  this  characterization  is  actually  quite  useful.29  Think  about  all  the  different  ways  of  manipulating  images  available  in  Photoshop and the degree of control provided by its multiple tools.  Think  also  about  Photoshop’s  concept  of  a  visual  composition  as  a  stack  of  potentially  hundreds  of  layers,  each  with  its  own  transparency setting and multiple alpha channels. If we are able to  animate such a composition and continue using Photoshop’s tools  to adjust visual elements over time on all layers independently, this  indeed  constitutes  a  new  paradigm  for  creating  moving  images.  And this is what After Effects and other animation, visual effects,  and  compositing  software  make  possible  today.30  And  while  the  idea  of  working  with  a  number  of  layers  placed  on  top  of  each  other itself is not new—consider traditional cel animation, optical  printing,  video  switchers,  photo-collage,  graphic  design—going  from a few non-transparent layers to hundreds and even thousands  of layers, each with its controls, fundamentally changes not only  how a moving image looks but also what it can say. From being a  special effect reserved for particular shots, 2D compositing became  a part of the standard animation and video editing interface.   But  innovative  as  the  2D  compositing  paradigm  was,  by  the  beginning  of  the  2000s  it  was  supplemented  by  a  new  one:  3D  compositing.  If  2D  compositing  can  be  thought  as  an  extension   29 Soon after the initial release of After Effects in January 1993, CoSA  the company  that produced this software  was purchased by Aldus, which in turn was purchased  by Adobe—which was already selling Photoshop.  30 Photoshop  and  After  Effects  were  designed  originally  by  different  teams  at  different times, and even after both products were purchased by Adobe  it released  Photoshop in 1989 and After Effects in 1995 , it took Adobe a number of years to  build close links between After Effects and Photoshop eventually making it easy to  move assets between the two programs.   290   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  of already familiar media techniques, the new paradigm does not  come  from  any  previous  physical  or  electronic  media.  Instead,  it  takes the new born-digital media which was invented in the 1960s  and matured by the early 1990s—interactive 3D computer graphics  and  animation—and  transforms  it  into  a  general  platform  for  moving media design.   The  language  used  in  the  professional  production  milieu  today  reflects  an  implicit  understanding  that  3D  graphics  is  a  new medium unique to a computer. When people use the terms  “computer  visuals,”  “computer  imagery,”  or  “CGI”   which  is  an abbreviation for “computer generated imagery”  everybody  understands that they refer to 3D graphics as opposed to other  image  sources  such  as  “digital  photography.”  I  think  of  3D  computer graphics as a new media—as opposed to considering  it an extension of architectural drafting, projection geometry, or  set making—because they offer a new method for representing  three-dimensional  reality:  both  objects  that  already  exist  and  objects  that  are  only  imagined.  This  method  is  fundamentally  different from what has been offered by the main representational  media of the industrial era: lens-based capture  still photography,  film recording, video  and audio recording. With 3D computer  graphics, we can represent a three-dimensional structure of the  world, versus capturing only a perspectival image of the world,  as in lens-based recording. We can also manipulate our represen- tation using various tools with ease and precision—qualitatively  different from the much more limited “manipulability” of a model  made  from  any  physical  material   although  nanotechnology  promises  to  change  this  in  the  future .  And,  as  contemporary  architectural  aesthetics  makes  clear,  3D  computer  graphics  is  not simply a faster way of working with geometric representa- tions  like  the  plans  and  cross-sections  used  by  draftsmen  for  centuries.  When  generations  of  young  architects  and  architec- tural students started to systematically work with 3D modeling  and animation software such as Alias in the middle of the 1990s,  the ability to directly manipulate a 3D shape  rather than only  dealing  with  its  projections  as  in  traditional  drafting   quickly  led to a whole new language of complex non-rectangular curved  forms. In other words, architects working with the media of 3D  computer graphics started to imagine different things than their  predecessors who used pencils, rules, and drafting tables.      MEDIA  DESIGN    291    When  the  Velvet  Revolution  of  the  1990s  made  it  possible  to  easily  combine  multiple  media  sources  in  a  single  moving  image  sequence  using  multi-layer  interface  of  After  Effects,  CGI  was  added to the mix. Today, 3D models are routinely used in media  compositions created in After Effects and similar software, along  with all other media sources. But in order to be a part of the mix,  these models need to be placed on their own 2D layers and thus  treated as 2D images. This was the original After Effects paradigm:  all image media can meet as long as they are reduced to 2D.31   In  contrast,  in  the  3D  compositing  paradigm  all  media  types  are  placed  within  a  single  3D  space.  One  advantage  of  this  representation is that since 3D space is “native” to 3D computer  graphics,  3D  models  can  stay  as  they  are,  i.e.  three-dimensional.  An additional advantage is that the designer can now use all the  techniques of virtual cinematography as developed in 3D computer  animation. S he can define different kinds of lights, fly the virtual  camera around and through the image planes using any trajectory,  and use depth of field and motion blur effects.32    While  3D  computer-generated  models  already  “live”  in  this  space,  how  do  you  bring  in  two-dimensional  visual  elements— video, digitized film, typography, drawn images? If 2D compositing  paradigm treated everything as 2D images—including 3D computer  models—3D  compositing  treats  everything  as  3D.  So  while  two-dimension elements do not inherently have a third dimension,  it  has  to  be  added  to  enable  these  elements  to  enter  the  three- dimensional space. To do that, a designer places flat cards in this   31 I say “original” because the later version of After Effects added the ability to work  with 3D layers. 32 If  2D  compositing  can  be  understood  as  an  extension  of  twentieth-century  cel  animation, where a composition consists of a stack of flat drawings, the conceptual  source of the 3D compositing paradigm is different. It comes out of the work on  integrating live action footage and CGI done in the 1980s in the context of feature  films production. Both film director and computer animator work in a three-dimen- sional space: the physical space of the set in the first case, the virtual space as defined  by 3D modeling software in the second case. Therefore conceptually it makes sense  to use three-dimensional space as a common platform for the integration of these  two worlds. It is not accidental that NUKE, one of today’s leading programs for 3D  compositing was developed in-house at Digital Domain, which was co-founded in  1993 by James Cameron, the Hollywood director who has systematically advanced  the integration of CGI and live action in films such as The Abyss  1989 , Terminator  2  1991 , and Titanic  1997 .   292   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  “In the 3D compositing paradigm all media types are placed within a  single 3D space.” This illustration uses the animation from earlier, but  adds the third dimension. We positioned each element at a different  depth, and added a light, casting shadows.      MEDIA  DESIGN    293  space in particular locations, and situates two-dimensional images  on these cards. Now, everything lives in a common 3D space. This  condition enables “deep remixability” between techniques which I  have illustrated using the example of “Go” video. The techniques  of drawing, photography, cinematography, and typography which  go  into  capturing  or  creating  two-dimensional  visual  elements  can now “play” together with all the techniques of 3D computer  animation   virtual  camera  moves,  controllable  depth  of  field,  variable lens, etc.   In  1995  I  wrote  the  article  ‘What  is  Digital  Cinema?’  The    article asked how the changes in moving image production I was  witnessing  I was living in Los Angeles at that time, which made it  easy to follow what was happening in Hollywood  were affecting  the meaning of “cinema.” In that article I proposed that the logic  of hand-drawn animation, which throughout the twentieth century  was marginal in relation to cinema, became dominant in a software  era. Because software allows the designer to manually manipulate  any image regardless of its source as though it was drawn in the  first  place,  the  ontological  differences  between  different  image  media  become  irrelevant.  Both  conceptually  and  practically,  they  are all reduced to hand-drawn animation.    By default, After Effects and other animation video editing 2D  compositing software treats a moving image project as a stack of  layers. Therefore, I can extend my original argument and propose  that animation logic also moves from the marginal to the dominant  position  in  yet  another  way.  The  paradigm  of  a  composition  as  a  stack  of  separate  visual  elements  as  practiced  in  cel  animation  becomes the default way of working with all images in a software  environment—regardless of their origin and final output media. In  other words, a “moving image” is now understood as a composite  of  layers  of  imagery—rather  than  as  a  still  flat  picture  that  only  changes in time, as it was the case for most of the twentieth century.  In the word of animation, editing, and compositing software, such  a “single layer image” becomes an exception.   The emergence of the 3D compositing paradigm can be also seen  as following this logic of historical reversal. The new representa- tional structure as developed within the computer graphics field—a  3D virtual space containing 3D models—has gradually moved from  a marginal to a dominant role. In the 1970s and 1980s computer  graphics were used only occasionally in a dozen feature films such    294   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  as Alien  1979 , Tron  1981 , The Last Starfighter  1984 , and The  Abyss   1989 ,  and  selected  television  commercials  and  broadcast  graphics.  But  by  the  beginning  of  the  2000s,  the  representation  structure  of  computer  graphics,  i.e.  a  3D  virtual  space,  came  to  function  as  an  umbrella  for  all  other  image  types  regardless  of  their origin. An example of an application which implements this  paradigm  is  Flame,  enthusiastically  described  by  one  user  as  “a  full  3D  compositing  environment  into  which  you  can  bring  3D  models, create true 3D text and 3D particles, and distort layers in  3D space.”33    This does not mean that 3D animation itself became visually  dominant in moving image culture, or that the 3D structure of  the  space  within  which  media  compositions  are  now  routinely  constructed is necessarily made visible  usually it is not . Rather,  the  way  3D  computer  animation  organizes  visual  data—as  objects  positioned  in  a  Cartesian  space—became  the  way  to  work with all moving image media. As already stated above, a  designer positions all the elements which go into a composition— 2D animated sequences, 3D objects, particle systems, video and  digitized  film  sequences,  still  images  and  photographs—inside  the shared 3D virtual space. There these elements can be further  animated, transformed, blurred, filtered, etc. So while all moving  image  media  has  been  reduced  to  the  status  of  hand-drawn  animation  in  terms  of  their  manipulability,  we  can  also  state  that all media have become layers in 3D space. In short, the new  media of 3D computer animation has “eaten up” the dominant  media  of  the  industrial  age—lens-based  photo,  film  and  video  recording.   Having  discussed  how  software  has  redefined  the  concept  of  a  “moving  image”  as  a  composite  of  multiple  layers,  this  is  a  good moment to pause and consider other possible ways software  changed this concept. When cinema in its modern form was born in  the end of the nineteenth century, the new medium was understood  as an extension of already familiar one—that is, as a photographic  image which was now moving. This understanding can be found in  the press accounts of the day and also in one of the official names  given  to  the  new  medium—“moving  pictures.”  On  the  material   33 Alan  Okey,  post  to  forums.creativecow.net,  December  28,  2005,  http:  forums. creativecow.net cgi-bin dev_read_post.cgi?forumid=154&postid=855029      MEDIA  DESIGN    295  level,  a  film  indeed  consisted  of  separate  photographic  frames.  When  they  quickly  replace  each  other,  this  creates  the  effect  of  motion for the viewer. So the concept used to understand cinema  indeed fit in with the structure of the medium.    But  is  this  concept  still  appropriate  today?  When  we  record  video  and  play  it,  we  are  still  dealing  with  the  same  structure:  a  sequence of frames. But for professional media designers, the terms  have changed. The importance of these changes is not just academic  and purely theoretical—because designers understand their media  differently, they are creating films and sequences that also look very  different from twentieth-century cinema or animation.   Consider  those  new  ways  of  creating  moving  images   which  I  referred to as a new paradigms  that we have discussed thus far.   Although  theoretically  they  are  not  necessarily  all  compatible  with  each  other,  in  production  practice  these  different  paradigms  are used in a complementary fashion.  A “moving image” became  a  hybrid  which  can  combine  all  different  visual  media  invented  so far—rather than holding only one kind of data such as camera  recording,  hand  drawing,  etc.  Rather  than  being  understood  as  a  singular  flat  plane—the  result  of  light  focused  by  the  lens  and  captured  by  the  recording  surface—it  is  now  understood  as  a  stack  of  a  potentially  infinite  number  of  separate  layers.  And  rather  than  “time-based,”  it  becomes  “composition-based,”  or  “object—oriented.” That is, instead of being treated as a sequence  of frames arranged in time, a “moving image” is now understood  as  a  two-dimensional  composition  that  consists  of  a  number  of  objects that can be manipulated independently. Alternatively, if a  designer  uses  3D  compositing,  the  conceptual  shift  is  even  more  dramatic: instead of editing “images,” s he is working in a virtual  three-dimensional space that holds both CGI and lens-recorded flat  image sources.    Of  course,  frame-based  representation  did  not  disappear—it  became simply a recoding and output format rather than the space  where  a  film  is  being  put  together.  And  while  the  term  “moving  image” can be still used as an appropriate description for how the  output of a production process is experienced by the viewers, it is  no longer captures how the designers think about what they create.  Because their production environment—workflow, interfaces, and  tools—has changed so much, they are thinking today very differ- ently than twenty years ago.    296   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND    If we focus on what the different paradigms summarized above  have in common, we can say that filmmakers, editors, special effects  artists, animators, and motion graphics designers are all working  on a composition in 2D or a 3D space that consists of a number of  separate objects. The spatial dimension has become as important  as the temporal dimension. From the concept of a “moving image”  understood  as  a  sequence  of  static  photographs  we  have  moved  to  a  new  concept:  a  modular  media  composition.  And  while  a  person who directs a feature or a short film that is centered around  actors and live action can be still called a “filmmaker,” in all other  cases  where  most  of  the  production  takes  place  in  a  software  environment, it is more appropriate to call the person a “designer.”  This is yet another fundamental change in the concept of “moving  images”:  today  more  often  than  not  they  are  not  “captured,”  “directed,” or “animated.” Instead, they are “designed.”   Import export: design workflow   In our discussions of the After Effects interface and workflow, as  well as the newer paradigm of 3D compositing, we have already  come across the crucial aspect of software-based media production  process.  Until  the  arrival  of  software-based  tools  in  the  1990s,  combining different types of time-based media together was either  time  consuming,  expensive,  or  in  some  cases  simply  impossible.  Software tools such as After Effects have changed this situation in a  fundamental way. Now a designer can import different media into  their composition with just a few mouse clicks.    However,  the  contemporary  software-based  design  of  moving  images—or  any  other  design  process,  for  that  matter—does  not  simply  involve  combining  elements  from  different  sources  within  a  single  application.  In  this  section  we  will  look  at  the  whole  workflow  typical  of  contemporary  design—be  it  the  design  of  moving  images,  still  illustrations,  3D  objects  and  scenes,  archi- tecture, music, websites, or any other media.  Most of the details  of  software-based  production  of  moving  images  which  I  have  already presented also applies to the graphic design of still images  and layouts for print, the web, packaging, physical spaces, mobile  devices, etc. However, in this section I want to make this explicit.       MEDIA  DESIGN    297  Therefore the examples below will include not only moving images,  but also graphic design.    Although  “import export”  commands  appear  in  most  modern  media  authoring  and  editing  software  applications  running  under  a  GUI, at first sight they do not seem to be very important for under- standing  software  culture.  When  you  “import,”  you  are  neither  authoring  new  media  nor  modifying  media  objects,  nor  accessing  information across the globe, as in web browsing. All these commands  allow you to do is to move data around between different applications.  In other words, they make data created in one application compatible  with other applications. And that does not look so important.   Think  again.  What  is  the  largest  part  of  the  economy  of  the  greater  Los  Angeles  area?  It  is  not  entertainment.  From  movie  production to museums and everything in between, entertainment  only  accounts  for  15  percent.  It  turns  out  that  the  largest  part  of  the  economy  is  the  import export  business—more  than  60  percent.  More  generally,  one  commonly  evoked  characteristic  of  globalization  is  greater  connectivity—places,  systems,  countries,  organizations etc. becoming connected in more and more ways. And  connectivity can only happen if you have certain level of compat- ibility: between business codes and procedures, between shipping  technologies,  between  network  protocols,  between  computer  file  formats, and so on.    Let us take a closer look at import export commands. As I will  try to show below, these commands play a crucial role in software  culture, and in particular in media design—regardless of what kind  of project a design is working on.   Before  they  adopted  software  tools  in  the  1990s,  filmmakers,  graphic  designers,  and  animators  used  completely  different  technologies. Therefore, as much as they were influenced by each  other  or  shared  the  same  aesthetic  sensibilities,  they  inevitably  created  different-looking  images.  Filmmakers  used  camera  and  film  technology  designed  to  capture  three-dimensional  physical  reality.  Graphic  designers  were  working  with  offset  printing  and  lithography. Animators were working with their own technologies:  transparent  cels  and  an  animation  stand  with  a  stationary  film  camera  capable  of  making  exposures  one  frame  at  a  time  as  the  animator changed cels and or moved background.    As  a  result,  twentieth-century  cinema,  graphic  design,  and  animation  I am talking here about standard animation techniques    298   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  used  by  most  commercial  studios   developed  distinct  artistic  languages and vocabularies both in terms of form and content. For  example, graphic designers worked with a two dimensional space,  film  directors  arranged  compositions  in  three-dimensional  space,  and  cel  animators  worked  with  “two-and-a-half”  dimensions.  This  holds  for  the  overwhelming  majority  of  works  produced  in  each  field,  although  of  course  exceptions  do  exist.  For  instance,  Oskar Fischinger made one abstract film that consisted of simple  geometric objects moving in an empty space—but as far as I know  this is the only film in the history of abstract pre-digital animation  that takes place in three-dimensional space.    Differences  in  technology  influenced  what  kind  of  content  would  appear  in  different  media.  Cinema  showed  “photoreal- istic”  images  of  nature,  built  environments  and  human  forms  articulated  by  special  lighting.  Graphic  designs  featured  typog- raphy, abstract graphic elements, monochrome backgrounds, and  cutout  photographs.  And  cartoons  presented  hand-drawn  flat  characters  and  objects  animated  over  hand-drawn   but  more  detailed  backgrounds. The exceptions are rare. For instance, while  architectural spaces frequently appeared in films because directors  could  explore  their  three—dimensionality  in  staging  scenes,  they  practically  never  appeared  in  animated  films  in  any  detail—until  animation studios started using 3D computer animation.   Why  was  it  so  difficult  to  cross  boundaries?  For  instance,  in  theory one could imagine making an animated film in the following  way: printing a series of slightly different graphics designs and then  filming them as though they were a sequence of animated cels. Or  a film where a designer simply made a series of hand drawings that  used the exact vocabulary of graphic design and then filmed them  one by one. And yet, to the best of my knowledge, such a film was  never  made.  What  we  find  instead  are  many  abstract  animated  films  that  have  a  certain  connection  to  various  styles  of  abstract  painting.  For  example,  Oskar  Fischinger’s  films  and  paintings  share certain forms. We can also find abstract films and animated  commercials  and  movie  titles  that  have  a  connection  to  graphic  design aesthetics popular around the same time. For instance, some  moving image sequences made by motion graphics pioneer Pablo  Ferro in the 1960s display psychedelic aesthetics which can also be  found in posters, record covers, and other works of graphic design  in the same period.       MEDIA  DESIGN    299    And  yet  despite  these  connections,  works  in  different  media  never  used  exactly  the  same  visual  language.  One  reason  is  that  projected  film  could  not  adequately  show  the  subtle  differences  between typeface sizes, line widths, and gray-scale tones crucial for  modern graphic design. Therefore, when the artists were working  on abstract art films or commercials that adopted design aesthetics   and most major twentieth-century abstract animators worked both  on  their  personal  films  and  commercials ,  they  could  not  simply  expand  the  language  of  a  printed  page  into  the  time  dimension.  They essentially had to invent a parallel visual language that used  bold contrasts, more easily readable forms, and thick lines—that,  because of their thickness, were in fact no longer lines but shapes.    Although the limitations in resolution and contrast of film and  television image in comparison to a printed page contributed to the  distance  between  the  languages  used  by  abstract  filmmakers  and  graphic designers for the most of the twentieth century, ultimately  I  do  not  think  it  was  the  decisive  factor.  Today  the  resolution,  contrast and color reproduction between print, computer screens,  television  screens,  and  the  screens  of  mobile  phones  are  also  substantially  different—and  yet  we  often  see  exactly  the  same  visual  strategies  deployed  across  these  different  display  media.  If  you want to be convinced, leaf through any book or a magazine on  contemporary 2D design  i.e., graphic design for print, broadcast,  and  the  web .  When  you  look  at  pages  featuring  the  works  of  a  particular designer or a design studio, in most cases it is impossible  to identify the origins of the images unless you read the captions.  Only then do you find which image is a poster, which one is a still  from a music video, and which one is a magazine editorial.  I am going to use Graphic Design for the 21st Century: 100 of the    World’s Best Graphic Designers  Taschen, 2001  for my examples  because by 2001, the changes I describe had already taken place.  Peter Anderson’s design showing a line of type against a cloud of  hundreds of little letters in various orientations turns out to be the  frames from the title sequence for a Channel 4 documentary. His  other design which similarly plays on the contrast between jumping  letters  in  a  larger  font  against  irregularly  cut  planes  made  from  densely packed letters in much smaller fonts, turns to be a spread  from IT Magazine. Since the first design was made for broadcast  while  the  second  was  made  for  print,  we  would  expect  that  the  first  design  would  employ  bolder  forms—however,  both  designs    300   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  use the same scale between big and small fonts, and feature texture  fields composed from hundreds of words in such a small font that  they  are  clearly  not  intended  to  be  read.  A  few  pages  later  we  encounter a design by Philippe Apeloig that uses exactly the same  technique and aesthetics as Anderson used. In this case, tiny lines  of text positioned at different angles form a 3D shape floating in  space. On the next page another design by Apeloig creates a field in  perspective—made not from letters but from hundreds of identical  abstract shapes.    These designs rely on the software’s ability  or on the designer  being  influenced  by  software  use  and  recreating  what  s he  did  with  software  manually   to  treat  text  as  any  graphical  primitive  and to easily create compositions made from hundreds of similar  or  identical  elements  positioned  according  to  some  pattern.  And  since an algorithm can easily modify each element in the pattern,  changing  its  position,  size,  color,  etc.,  instead  of  the  completely  regular grids of modernism we see more complex structures that  are made from many variations of the same element. This strategy  is explored particularly imaginatively in Zaha Hadid’s designs such  as the Louis Vuitton “Icone Bag” 2006, and in her urban master  plans  for  Singapore  and  Turkey,  which  use  what  Hadid  called  a  “variable grid.”    Each  designer  included  in  the  book  was  asked  to  provide  a  brief statement to accompany the portfolio of his her work, and  Lust  Studio  has  chosen  the  phrase  “Form-follows-process”  as  their motto. So what is the nature of the design process in the  software age and how does it influence the forms we see today  around us?    If  you  are  practically  involved  in  design  or  art  today,  you  already  know  that  contemporary  designers  use  the  same  small  set  of  software  tools  to  design  just  about  everything.  I  have  already named them repeatedly, so you know the list: Photoshop,  Illustrator, Flash, Maya, etc. However, the crucial factor is not the  tools  themselves  but  the  workflow  process,  enabled  by  “import”  and  “export”  operations  and  related  methods   “place,”  “insert  object,”  “subscribe,”  “smart  object,”  etc. ,  that  ensure  coordi- nation between these tools.    When  a  particular  media  project  is  being  put  together,  the  software used at the final stage depends on the type of output media  and  the  nature  of  the  project—After  Effects  for  motion  graphics       MEDIA  DESIGN    301  Examples of a “variable grid” in architecture: two master plans by  Zaha Hadid. Top: Kartal Pendik, Istanbul, 2006. Bottom: One North,  Singapore, 2001.   302   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  projects  and  video  compositing,  Illustrator  for  print  illustrations,  InDesign for multi-page designs, Flash for interactive interfaces and  web animations, 3ds Max or Maya for 3D computer models and  animations, and so on. But these programs are rarely used alone  to create a media design from start to finish. Typically, a designer  may  create  elements  in  one  program,  import  them  into  another  program, add elements created in yet another program, and so on.  This happens regardless whether the final product is an illustration  for print, a website, or a motion graphics sequence, whether it is a  still or a moving image, interactive or non-interactive, etc.    The very names which software companies give to the products  for  media  design  and  production  refer  to  this  defining  character- istic of software-based design process. Since 2005, Adobe has been  selling its different media authoring applications bundled together  under the name “Adobe Creative Suite.” Among the subheadings  and  phrases  that  were  used  to  accompany  this  brand  name,  one  in particular is highly meaningful in the context of our discussion:  “Design Across Media.” This phrase accurately describes both the  capabilities of the applications collected in a suite and their actual  use in the real world. Each of the key applications collected in the  suite—Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Flash, Dreamweaver, After  Effects, Premiere—has many special features geared for producing  a design for particular output media. Illustrator is set up to work  with professional-quality printers; After Effects and Premiere can  output  video  files  in  a  variety  of  standard  video  formats  such  as  HDTV;  Dreamweaver  supports  programming  and  scripting  languages  to  enable  creation  of  sophisticated  and  large-scale  dynamic websites. But while a design project is finished in one of  these applications, most other applications in Adobe Creative Suite  will be used in the process to create and edit its various elements.  This  is  one  of  the  ways  in  which  Adobe  Creative  Suite  enables  “design across media.” The compatibility between applications also  means that the elements  called in professional language “assets”   can  be  later  re-used  in  new  projects.  For  instance,  a  photograph  edited in Photoshop can first be used in a magazine ad and later  put  in  a  video,  a  website,  etc.  Or,  the  3D  models  and  characters  created  for  a  feature  film  can  be  reused  for  a  video  game  based  on  the  film.  This  ability  to  re-use  the  same  design  elements  for  very different projects is very important because of the widespread  practice in creative industries to create products across the range       MEDIA  DESIGN    303  of media which share the same images, designs, characters, narra- tives,  etc.  An  advertising  campaign  often  works  “across  media”  including web ads, TV ads, magazine ads, billboards, etc. And if  turning movies into games and games into movies has been already  popular  in  Hollywood  since  the  early  1990s,  a  new  trend  since  approximately the middle of the 2000s is to create a movie, a game,  a website or maybe other media products at the same time—and  have all the products use the same digital assets both for economic  reasons and to assure aesthetic continuity between these products.  Thus,  a  studio  may  create  3D  backgrounds  and  characters  and  put  them  in  both  a  movie  and  a  game,  both  of  which  will  be  released simultaneously. If media authoring applications were not  compatible, such a practice would simply not be possible.    All  these  examples  illustrate  the  intentional  reuse  of  design  elements  “across  media.”  However,  the  compatibility  between  media authoring applications also has a much broader and uninten- tional  effect  on  contemporary  aesthetics.  Given  the  production  workflow I have just described, we may expect that the same visual  techniques  and  strategies  will  also  appear  in  all  types  of  media  projects  designed  with  software,  without  this  being  consciously  planned for. We may also expect that this will happen on a much  more  basic  level.  This  is  indeed  the  case.  The  same  software- enabled design strategies, the same software-based techniques, and  the same software-generated iconography are now found across all  types of media, all scales, and all kinds of projects.    We  have  already  encountered  a  few  concrete  examples.  For  instance, the three designs by Peter Anderson and Philippe Apeloig  done  for  different  media  use  the  same  basic  computer  graphic  technique:  automatic  generation  of  a  repeating  pattern  while  varying the parameters that control the appearance of each element  making  up  the  pattern—its  size,  position,  orientation,  curvature,  etc.  The general principle behind this technique can also be used  to  generate  3D  models,  animations,  textures,  make  plants  and  landscapes,  etc.  It  is  often  referred  to  as  “parametric  design,”  or  “parametric  modeling.”   The  same  technique  is  also  used  by  Hadid’s  studio  for  the  Louis  Vuitton  “Icone  Bag”.  In  another  example, which will be discussed below, Greg Lynn used particle  systems  technique—which  at  that  time  was  normally  used  to  simulate  fire,  snow,  waterfalls,  and  other  natural  phenomena  in  cinema—to generate the forms of a building.    304   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND    To  use  the  biological  metaphor,  we  can  say  that  compatibility  between design applications creates very favorable conditions for  the  propagation  of  media  DNA  between  species,  families,  and  classes.  And  this  propagation  happens  on  all  levels:  the  whole  design,  parts  of  a  design,  the  elements  making  up  the  parts,  and  the  “atoms”  that  make  up  the  elements.  Consider  the  following  hypothetical example of propagation on a lower level. A designer  can  use  Illustrator  to  create  a  2D  smooth  curve   called  in  the  computer graphics field a “spline.”  This curve becomes a building  block that can be used in any project. It can form part of an illus- tration  or  a  book  design.  It  can  be  imported  into  an  animation  program  where  it  can  be  set  to  motion,  or  imported  into  3D  program  where  it  can  be  extruded  in  3D  space  to  define  a  solid  object.    Over  time  software  manufacturers  worked  to  develop  tighter  ways  of  connecting  their  applications, in order to make it easier  to move elements from one application to another. Over the years,  it became possible to move a whole project between applications  without  losing  anything   or  almost  anything .  For  example,  in  describing the integration between Illustrator CS3 and Photoshop  CS3, Adobe’s website states that a designer can “Preserve layers,  layer  comps,  transparency,  and  editable  files  when  moving  files  between  Photoshop  and  Illustrator.”34  Another  important  devel- opment  has  been  the  concept  that  Microsoft  Office  calls  “linked  objects.”  If  you  link  all  or  part  of  one  file  to  another  file   for  instance, linking an Excel document to a PowerPoint presentation ,  anytime information changes in the first file it automatically gets  updated  in  the  second  file.  Many  media  applications  implement  this feature. To use the same example of Illustrator CS3, a designer  can  “Import  Illustrator  files  into  Adobe  Premiere  Pro  software,  and  then  use  Edit  Original  command  to  open  the  artwork  in  Illustrator,  edit  it,  and  see  your  changes  automatically  incorpo- rated into your video project.”35   Each type of program used by media designers—3D graphics,  vector  drawing,  image  editing,  animation,  compositing—excel  at particular design operations, i.e. particular ways of creating  design  elements  or  modifying  already  existing  elements.  These   34 http:  www.adobe.com products illustrator features allfeatures   August 30, 2008 . 35 Ibid.      MEDIA  DESIGN    305  operations can be compared to the different types of blocks of a  LEGO set. You can create an infinite number of projects by using  the limited number of block types provided in the set. Depending  on the project, these block types will have different functions and  appear  in  different  combinations.  For  example,  a  rectangular  block may become part of the tabletop, part of the head of a robot,  etc.   A  design  workflow  that  uses  a  small  number  of  compatible  software  programs  works  in  a  similar  way—with  one  important  difference.  The  building  blocks  used  in  contemporary  design  are  not only different kinds of visual elements one can create—vector  patterns,  3D  objects,  particle  systems,  etc.—but  also  various  ways  of  modifying  these  elements:  blur,  skew,  vectorize,  change  transparency  level,  extrude,  etc.  This  difference  is  crucial.  If  media  creation  and  editing  software  did  not  include  these  and  many  other  modification  operations,  we  would  see  an  altogether  different  visual  language  at  work  today.  We  would  see  “multi- media,”  i.e.  designs  that  simply  combine  elements  from  different  media.  Instead,  we  see  “deep  remixability”—the  “deep”  interac- tions between working methods and techniques of different media  within a single project.    In  a  “crossover”  use,  the  techniques  which  were  previously  specific  to  one  media  are  applied  to  other  media  types   for  example,  a  lens  blur  filter .  This  often  can  be  done  within  a  single  application—for  instance,  applying  After  Effects’  blur  filter  to  a  composition  which  can  contain  graphic  elements,  video, 3D objects, etc. And being able to move a whole project  or  its  elements  between  applications  opens  more  possibilities  because  each  application  offers  many  unique  techniques  not  available in other applications. As the media data travels from  one application to the next, it is being transformed and enhanced  using the operations offered by each application. For example,  a designer can take the project s he has been editing in Adobe  Premiere  and  import  it  in  After  Effects  where  s he  can  use  advanced  compositing  features  of  that  program.  S he  can  then  import the result back into Premiere and continue editing. Or s  he can create artwork in Photoshop or Illustrator and import it  into Flash where it can be animated. This animation can be then  imported into a video editing program and combined with video.  And so on.    306   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND    The production workflow specific to the software era that I have  just  illustrated  has  two  major  consequences.  Its  first  result  is  the  visual aesthetics of hybridity that dominates contemporary design  universe. The second is the use of the same techniques and strat- egies across this universe—regardless of the output media and type  of project.    As  I  have  already  stated  more  than  once,  a  typical  design  today  combines  techniques  coming  from  multiple  media.  We  are  now in a better position to understand why this is the case. As a  designer works on a project, s he combines the results of the opera- tions  specific  to  different  software  programs  that  were  originally  created  to  imitate  work  with  different  physical  media   Illustrator  was  created  to  make  illustrations,  Photoshop  to  edit  digitized  photographs; Premiere to edit video, etc.  While these operations  continue  to  be  used  in  relation  to  their  original  media,  most  of  them are now also used as part of the workflow on any design job.    The  essential  condition  that  enables  this  new  design  logic  and  the  resulting  aesthetics  is  compatibility  between  files  generated  by  different  programs.  In  other  words,  “import,”  “export”  and  related  functions  and  commands  of  graphics,  animation,  video  editing, compositing and modeling software are historically more  important than the individual operations these programs offer. The  ability to combine raster and vector layers within the same image,  place  3D  elements  into  a  2D  composition  and  vice  versa,  etc.  is  what enables the production workflow and its reuse of the same  techniques, effects, and iconography across different media.   The consequences of this compatibility between software and file  formats, which was gradually achieved during the 1990s, are hard  to overestimate. Besides the hybridity of modern visual aesthetics  and  the  reappearance  of  exactly  the  same  design  techniques  across all output media, there are also other effects. For instance,  the  whole  field  of  motion  graphics  as  it  exists  today  came  into  existence to a large extent because of the integration between vector  drawing  software,  specifically  Illustrator,  and  animation compos- iting  software  such  as  After  Effects.  A  designer  typically  defines  various composition elements in Illustrator and then imports them  into After Effects where they are animated. This compatibility did  not exist when the initial versions of different media authoring and  editing  software  became  available  in  the  1980s.  It  was  gradually  added  in  particular  software  releases.  But  when  it  was  achieved       MEDIA  DESIGN    307  around  the  middle  of  the  1990s,36  within  a  few  years  the  whole  language of contemporary graphic design was fully imported into  the moving image area—both literally and metaphorically.    In  summary,  the  compatibility  between  graphic  design,  illus- tration, animation, video editing, 3D modeling and animation, and  visual effects software plays the key role in shaping the visual and  spatial forms of the software age. On the one hand, never before  have we witnessed such a variety of forms as today. On the other  hand, exactly the same techniques, compositions and iconography  can now appear in any media.   Variable form  As  the  films  of  Blake  and  Murata  discussed  earlier  illustrate,  in  contemporary  motion  graphics  the  transformations  often  affect  the frame as a whole. In contrast to twentieth-century animation,  everything inside the frame keeps changing: visual elements, their  transparency,  the  texture  of  the  image,  etc.  In  fact,  if  something  stays  the  same  for  a  while,  that  is  an  exception  rather  than  the  norm.    Such constant change on many visual dimensions is another key  feature  of  motion  graphics  and  design  cinema  produced  today.  Just as we did in the case of media hybridity, we can connect this  preference for constant change to the particulars of software used  in media design.   Digital  computers  allow  us  to  represent  any  phenomenon  or  structure as a set of variables. In the case of design and animation  software,  this  means  that  all  possible  forms—visual,  temporal,  spatial,  interactive—are  similarly  represented  as  sets  of  variables  that  can  change  continuously.  This  new  logic  of  form  is  deeply  encoded in the interfaces of software packages and the tools they  provide.    Consider again the After Effects interface. To create an animation,  a designer adds a number of elements to the composition and then  animates them. Each new element shows up in the interface as a   36 In 1995, After Effects 3.0 enabled importing Illustrator files and Photoshop files  as compositions. http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Adobe_After_Effects   308   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  “To create an animation, a designer adds a number of elements to the  composition and then animates them. Each new element shows up in  the interface as a list of parameters. Animating any parameter is equally  easy, and it only takes a few clicks.” The illustration shows a part of  After Effects Timeline panel for the 3D animation illustrated earlier.

To create this illustration, we redrew a part of the After  Effects Timeline panel screenshot that appears on the opposite page to  only show the parameter names.    310   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  list of parameters, each with its animation channel. Depending on  the element type, the parameters range from a few to a dozen or  more. For example, for lights, their parameters are intensity, color,  shadow darkness and shadow diffusion. If an element is a camera,  the parameters include its point of interest, position, orientation,  and rotation. For shapes, the list of parameters is particularly long:  position, scale, orientation, opacity, material properties including  cast  shadows,  light  transmission,  ambient,  diffuse,  and  specular  qualities, shininess, and others.    Animating any parameter only takes a few clicks. The process  works  the  same  regardless  or  the  element  and  parameter  type.  Thus, it is equally easy to change over time the position of a shape,  its color, or the intensity of a light.    In  contrast  to  twentieth-century  animation,  After  Effects  does  not privilege movement of two-dimensional objects and characters.  Accordingly,  After  Effects  Help  defines  “animation”  as  “change  over  time”—without  specifying  what  can  change.37  The  answer  is  provided  by  the  interface  itself.  Its  design  suggests  that  you  can  animate  hundreds  of  visual  characteristics   and  if  we  also  consider that most filters can also be animated, the list goes into  thousands .   Because  the  software  interface  makes  directly  visible  every  parameter  for  every  object  in  the  composition,  assigning  each  its own channel on the timeline, it literally invites the designer  to  start  animating  them.  You  are  invited  to  start  moving  and  rotating objects, changing their opacity, colors, and so on. The  same  logic  extends  to  the  camera  and  the  lights.  If  you  add  a  light to the composition, this immediately creates half a dozen  new animation channels describing light’s color, position, orien- tation,  intensity,  and  shadow  properties,  each  with  its  own  timeline channel.  Other 2D and 3D animation and layer-based  compositing  software  packages  all  share  the  same  interface  principles.38    37 http:  help.adobe.com en_US AfterEffects 9.0   November 7, 2012 . 38 Node-based  compositing  software  uses  a  different  interface  principle:  each  element  in  a  composition  is  represented  as  node  in  a  graph.  This  interface  is  particularly useful for creating scenes that contain a very large number of elements  interacting  with  each  other.  Popular  industry  node-based  compositing  software  includes Fusion and Nuke.      MEDIA  DESIGN    311    During the 1980s and 1990s the general logic of computer repre- sentation—that  is,  representing  everything  as  variables  that  can  have  different  values—was  systematically  embedded  throughout  the  interfaces  of  media  design  software.  As  a  result,  although  a  particular  software  application  does  not  directly  prescribe  to  its  users what they can and cannot do, the structure of the interface  strongly  influences  the  designer’s  thinking.  In  the  case  of  moving  image  design,  the  result  of  having  a  timeline  interface  with  multiple channels all just waiting to be animated is that a designer  usually  does  animate  them.  If  previous  constraints  in  animation  technology—from  the  first  optical  toys  in  the  early  nineteenth  century  to  the  standard  cel  animation  system  in  the  twentieth  century—resulted in an aesthetics of discrete and limited temporal  changes, the interfaces of computer animation software quickly led  to a new aesthetics: the continuous transformations of most  or all   visual elements appearing in a frame.   This change in animation aesthetics deriving from the interface  design of animation software was paralleled by a change in another  field—architecture.  In  the  mid-1990s,  when  architects  started  to  use  software  originally  developed  for  computer  animation  and  special effects  first Alias and Wavefront; later Maya and others ,  the idea of animated form entered architectural thinking as well. If  2D animation compositing software such as After Effects enables  an animator to change any parameter of a 2D object  a video clip,  a 2D shapes, type, etc.  over time, 3D computer animation allows  the  same  for  any  3D  shape.  An  animator  can  set  up  key  frames  manually and let a computer calculate how a shape changes over  time.  Alternatively,  s he  can  direct  algorithms  that  will  not  only  modify  a  shape  over  time  but  can  also  generate  new  ones.   3D  computer  animation  tools  to  do  this  include  particle  systems,  physical  simulation,  behavioral  animation,  artificial  evolution,  L-systems,  etc.   Working  with  3D  animation  software  affected  architectural  imagination  both  metaphorically  and  literally.  The  shapes that started to appear in projects by young architects and  architecture students in the second part of the 1990s looked as if  they were in the process of being animated, captured as they were  transforming from one state to another. The presentations of archi- tectural projects and research begin to feature multiple variations  of  the  same  shape  generated  by  varying  parameters  in  software.  Finally, in projects such as Gregg Lynn’s New York Port Authority    312   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Gateway   1995 ,39  the  paths  of  objects  in  an  animation  were  literally turned into an architectural design. Using a particle system   a part of Wavefront animation software , which generates a cloud  of points and moves them in space to satisfy a set of constraints,  Lynn captured these movements and turned them into the curves  making up his proposed building.    Equally crucial was the exposure of architects to the new gener- ation of modeling tools in the commercial animation software of  the 1990s. For two decades the main technique for 3D modeling  was  to  represent  an  object  as  a  collection  of  flat  polygons.  But  by  the  mid-1990s,  the  faster  processing  speeds  of  computers  and  the  increased  size  of  computer  memory  made  it  practical  to  offer  another  technique  on  desktop  workstations—spline-based  modeling. This new technique for representing form pushed archi- tectural thinking away from rectangular modernist geometry and  toward the privileging of smooth and complex forms made from  continuous curves. As a result, since the second part of the 1990s,  the  aesthetics  of  “blobs”  has  come  to  dominate  the  thinking  of  many  architecture  students,  young  architects,  and  even  already  well-established “star” architects such as Zaha Hadid, Eric Moss,  and UN Studio.   But  this  was  not  the  only  consequence  of  the  switch  from  the  standard  architectural  tools  and  CAD  software   such  as  AutoCAD   to  animation special  effects  software.  Traditionally,  architects created new projects on the basis of existing typology. A  church, a private house, a railroad station all had their well-known  types—the spatial templates determining the way space was to be  organized.  Similarly,  when  designing  the  details  of  a  particular  project,  an  architect  would  select  from  the  various  standard  elements  with  well-known  functions  and  forms:  columns,  doors,  windows,  etc.40  In  the  twentieth  century  mass-produced  housing  only further embraced this logic, which eventually became encoded  in the interfaces of CAD software.    But when in the early 1990s, Gregg Lynn, the firm Asymptote,  Lars  Spuybroek,  and  other  young  architects  started  to  use  3D   39 Gregg Lynn, Animate Form  Princeton Architectural Press, 1999 , pp. 102–19. 40 I  am  grateful  to  Lars  Spuybroek,  the  principal  of  Nox,  for  explaining  to  me  how the use of software for architectural design subverted traditional architectural  thinking based on typologies.       MEDIA  DESIGN    313  software  that  had  been  created  for  other  industries—computer  animation, special effects, computer games, and industrial design— they  found  that  this  software  came  with  none  of  the  standard  architectural  templates  or  details.  In  addition,  if  CAD  software  for architects assumed that the basic building blocks of a structure  are  rectangular  forms,  3D  animation  software  came  without  such  assumptions.  Instead  it  offered  splined  curves  and  smooth  surfaces  and  shapes  constructed  from  these  curves  —which  were  appropriate for the creation of animated and game characters and  industrial products.  In fact, splines were originally introduced into  computer graphics in 1962 by Pierre Bézier for use in computer- aided car design.    As  a  result,  rather  than  being  understood  as  a  composition  made  up  of  template-driven  standardized  parts,  a  building  could  now be imagined as a single continuous curved form that can vary  infinitely.  It  could  also  be  imagined  as  a  number  of  continuous  forms interacting together. In either case, the shape of each of these  forms was not determined by any kind of a priori typology.     In retrospect, we can think of this highly productive “misuse”  of 3D animation and modeling software by architects as another  case of media hybridity—in particular, what I called the “crossover  effect.” In this case, it is a crossover between the conventions and  the  tools  of  one  design  field—character  animation  and  special  effects—and the ways of thinking and knowledge of another field,  namely, architecture.    Relating  this  discussion  of  architecture  to  the  main  subject  of  this  chapter—production  of  moving  images—we  can  see  now  that  by  the  1990s  both  fields  were  affected  by  computerization  in  a  structurally  similar  way.  In  the  case  of  twentieth  century  commercial  animation,  all  temporal  changes  inside  a  frame  were  limited, discrete, and usually semantically driven—i.e., connected  to the narrative. When an animated character moved, walked into  a  frame,  turned  his her  head,  or  extended  his her  arm,  this  was  used to advance the story.41 After the switch to a software-based  production  process,  moving  images  came  to  feature  constant   41 In the case of narrative animation produced in Russia, Eastern Europe and Japan,  the visual changes in a sequence were not always driven by the development of a  narrative  and  could  serve  other  purposes—establishing  a  mood,  representing  the  emotional state, or simply used aesthetically for its own sake.    314   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  changes  on  many  visual  dimensions  that  were  no  longer  limited  by semantics. As defined by numerous motion-graphics sequences  and short films of the 2000s, contemporary temporal visual form  constantly  changes,  pulsates,  and  mutates  beyond  the  need  to  communicate  meanings  and  narrative.   The  films  of  Blake  and  Murata offer striking examples of this new aesthetics of a variable  form; many other examples can easily be found by surfing websites  that  showcase  works  by  motion  graphics  studios  and  individual  designers.    A parallel process took place in architectural design. The differ- entiations in a traditional architectural form were connected to the  need  to  communicate  meaning  and or  to  fulfill  the  architectural  program. An opening in a wall was either a window or a door; a  wall was a boundary between functionally different spaces. Thus,  just as in animation, the changes in the form were limited and were  driven  by  semantics.  But  today,  the  architectural  form  designed  with modeling software can change its geometry across the whole  design, and these changes no longer have to be justified by function.   The  Yokohama  International  Port  Terminal   2002 ,  designed  by  Foreign  Office  Architects,  illustrates  very  well  the  aesthetics  of  variable  form  in  architecture.  The  building  is  a  complex  and  continuous spatial volume without a single right angle and with no  distinct boundaries that would break the form into parts or separate  it from the ground plane. Visiting the building in December 2003, I  spent four hours exploring the continuities between the exterior and  the interior spaces and enjoying the constantly changing curvature  of its surfaces. The building can be compared to a Mobius strip— except that it is much more complex, less symmetrical, and more  unpredictable.  It  would  be  more  appropriate  to  think  of  it  as  a  whole set of such strips smoothly interlinked together.    To summarize this discussion of how the shift to software-based  representations affected the modern language of form: all constants  were  substituted  by  variables  whose  values  can  change  continu- ously.  As  a  result,  culture  went  through  what  we  can  call  the  continuity turn. Both the temporal visual form of motion graphics  and  design  cinema  and  the  spatial  form  of  architecture  entered  the new universe of continuous change and transformation.  The  fields of product design and space design were similarly affected.   Previously, such aesthetics of “total continuity” was imagined by  only a few artists. For instance, in the 1950s, architect Frederick       MEDIA  DESIGN    315  Kiesler  conceived  a  project  titled  Continuous  House  that,  as  the  name implies, is a single continuously curving spatial form uncon- strained  by  the  usual  divisions  into  rooms.  But  when  architects  started to work with 3D modeling and animation software in the  1990s, such thinking became commonplace. Similarly, the under- standing of a moving image as a continuously changing visual form  without any cuts, which previously could be found only in a small  number of films made by experimental filmmakers throughout the  twentieth  century  such  as  Fischinger’s  Motion  Painting   1947 ,  now became the norm.    Today, there are many successful short films lasting only a few  minutes and small-scale building projects based on the aesthetics of  continuity—i.e. a single continuously changing form, but the next  challenge for both motion graphics and architecture is to discover  ways to employ this aesthetics on a larger scale. How do you scale  up the idea of a single continuously changing visual or spatial form,  without  any  cuts   for  films   or  divisions  into  distinct  parts   for  architecture ?    In  architecture,  a  number  of  architects  have  already  begun  to  successfully  address  this  challenge.  Examples  include  already  realized projects such as the Yokohama International Port Terminal,  the Kunsthaus in Graz by Peter Cook  2004 , and Ordos Museum  by MAD Architects in Inner Mongolia, China  2012 , as well as  those  under  construction,  such  as  Zaha  Hadid’s  Performing  Arts  Centre  on  Saadiyat  Island  in  Abu  Dhabi,  United  Arab  Emirates.   After the 2007 economic crisis, many ambitious building projects  in Dubai and Eastern Europe were delayed or cancelled, but China  and  other  countries  continue  to  take  risks  and  embrace  the  new  architectural  designs  made  from  complex  continuously  changing  curves.    What  about  motion  graphics?  Blake  has  been  one  of  the  few  artists to have systematically explored how hybrid visual language  can  work  in  longer  pieces.  Sodium  Fox  is  14  minutes;  an  earlier  piece, Mod Lang  2001 , is 16 minutes. The three films that make  up Winchester Trilogy  2001–4  run for 21, 18, and 12 minutes.  None of these films contain a single cut.    Sodium Fox and Winchester Trilogy use a variety of visual sources  including  photography,  old  film  footage,  drawings,  animation,  type, and computer imagery. All these media are woven together  into a continuous flow. As I have already pointed out in relation    316   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  The Yokohama International Port Terminal. Foreign Office Architects, 2002.      MEDIA  DESIGN    317   318   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  to Sodium Fox, in contrast to shorter motion-graphics pieces with  their  frenzy  of  movement  and  animation,  Blake’s  films  contain  very  little  animation  in  a  traditional  sense.  Instead,  various  still  or moving images gradually fade in on top of each other. So while  each film moves through a vast terrain of different visuals—color  and monochrome, completely abstract and figurative, ornamental  and  representational—it  is  impossible  to  divide  the  film  into  temporal units. In fact, even when I tried, I could not keep track  of how the film got from one kind of image to a very different one  just a couple of minutes later. And yet these changes were driven  by some kind of logic, even if my brain could not compute it while  I was watching each film.    The hypnotic continuity of these films can be partly explained  by the fact that all visual sources in the films were manipulated via  graphics software. In addition, many images were slightly blurred.  As a result, regardless of the origin of the images, they all acquired  a certain visual coherence. So although the films skillfully play on  the  visual  and  semantic  differences  between  live-action  footage,  drawings,  photographs  with  animated  filters  on  top  of  them,  and  other  media,  these  differences  do  not  create  juxtaposition  or  stylistic  montage.42  Instead,  various  media  seem  to  peacefully  coexist,  occupying  the  same  space.  In  other  words,  Blake’s  films  seem to suggest that deep remix is not the only possible result of  softwarization.    We  have  already  discussed  in  detail  Alan  Kay’s  concept  of  a  computer metamedium. According to Kay’s proposal made in the  1970s, we should think of the digital computer as a metamedium  containing all the different “already existing and non-yet-invented  media.”43 What does this imply for the aesthetics of digital projects?  In  my  view,  it  does  not  imply  that  the  different  media  neces- sarily  fuse  together,  or  make  up  a  new  single  hybrid,  or  result  in  “multimedia,”  “intermedia,”  “convergence,”  or  a  totalizing  Gesamtskunstwerk. As I have argued, rather than collapsing into  a  single  entity,  different  media   i.e.,  different  techniques,  data  formats,  data  sources,  and  working  methods   start  interacting,   42 In the “Compositing” chapter of The Language of New Media, I have defined  “stylistic  montage”  as  “juxtapositions  of  stylistically  diverse  images  in  different  media.”  43 Kay and Goldberg, “Personal Dynamic Media.”       MEDIA  DESIGN    319  producing a large number of hybrids, or new “media species.” In  other words, just as in biological evolution, media evolution in a  software era leads to differentiation and increased diversity—more  species rather than less.    In  the  world  dominated  by  hybrids,  Blake’s  films  are  rare  in  presenting  us  with  relatively  “pure”  media  appearances.  We  can  either  interpret  this  as  the  slowness  of  the  art  world,  which  is  behind the evolutionary stage of professional media—or as a clever  strategy  by  Blake  to  separate  himself  from  the  usual  frenzy  and  over-stimulation of motion graphics. Or we can read his aesthetics  as an implicit statement against the popular idea of “convergence.”  As demonstrated by Blake’s films, while different media has become  compatible,  this  does  not  mean  that  their  distinct  identities  have  collapsed.  In  Sodium  Fox  and  Winchester  Trilogy,  the  visual  elements in different media maintain their defining characteristics  and unique appearances.    Blake’s  films  also  expand  our  understanding  of  what  the  aesthetics  of  continuity  can  encompass.  Different  media  elements  are continuously added on top of each other, creating the experience  of a continuous flow, which nevertheless preserves their differences.  Danish  artist  Ann  Lislegaard  also  belongs  to  the  “continuity  generation.” A number of her films involve continuous navigation  or an observation of imaginary architectural spaces. We may relate  these films to the works of a number of twentieth-century painters  and  filmmakers  who  were  concerned  with  similar  spatial  experi- ences:  Giorgio  de  Chirico,  Balthus,  the  Surrealists,  Alain  Resnais   Last  Year  at  Marienbad ,  Andrei  Tarkovsky   Stalker .  However,  the  sensibility  of  Lislegaard’s  films  is  unmistakably  that  of  the  early  twenty-first  century.  The  spaces  are  not  clashing  together  as  in,  for  instance,  Last  Year  at  Marienbad,  nor  are  they  made  uncanny by the introduction of figures and objects  a practice of  René Magritte and other Surrealists . Instead, like her fellow artists  Blake and Murata, Lislegaard presents us with forms that continu- ously  change  before  our  eyes.  She  offers  us  yet  another  version  of the aesthetics of continuity made possible by software such as  After Effects, which translates the general logic of computer repre- sentation—the  substitution  of  all  constants  with  variables—into  concrete interfaces and tools.    The visual changes in Ann Lislegaard’s Crystal World  after J.  G.  Ballard    2006   happen  right  in  front  of  us,  and  yet  they  are    320   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  Crystal World  after J.

Installation  photographs.   322   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  practically impossible to track. Within the space of a minute, one  space is completely transformed into something very different.    Crystal  World  creates  its  own  hybrid  aesthetics,  one  that  combines  photorealistic  spaces,  completely  abstract  forms,  and  a  digitized  photograph  of  plants.   Although  I  do  not  know  the  exact  software  Lislegaard’s  assistant  used  for  this  film,  it  is  unmistakably  some  3D  computer  animation  package.   Since  everything is rendered in gray scale, the differences between media  are not loudly announced. And yet they are there. It is this kind  of  subtle  and  at  the  same  time  precisely  formulated  distinction  between different media that gives this video its unique beauty. In  contrast to twentieth-century montage, which created meaning and  effect through dramatic juxtapositions of semantics, compositions,  spaces,  and  different  media,  Lislegaard’s  aesthetics  fits  in  with  other minimalist cultural projects of the early twenty-first century.  Today,  the  creators  of  minimal  architecture  and  space  design,  web  graphics,  generative  animations  and  interactives,  ambient  electronic music, and progressive fashions similarly assume that a  user is intelligent enough to make out and enjoy subtle distinctions  and continuous modulations.   Lislegaard’s Bellona  after Samuel R. Delany   2005  takes the  aesthetics  of  continuity  in  a  different  direction.  We  are  moving  through  and  around  what  appears  to  be  a  single  set  of  spaces.   Historically, such continuous movement through a 3D space has  its roots in the early uses of 3D computer animation: first for flight  simulators and later in architectural walk-throughs and first-person  shooters.   While  we  pass  through  the  same  spaces  many  times,  each time they are rendered in a different color scheme. The trans- parency  and  reflection  levels  also  change.  Lislegaard  is  playing  a  game with the viewer: while the overall structure of the film soon  becomes clear, it is impossible to keep track of which space we are  in at any given moment. We are never quite sure if we have already  been there and it is now simply lit differently, or if it is a space that  we have not yet visited.    Bellona  can  be  read  as  an  allegory  of  “variable  form.”  In  this  case, variability is played out as seemingly endless color schemes and  transparency  settings.  It  does  not  matter  how  many  times  we  have  already seen the same space, it always can appear in a new way.    To show us our world and ourselves in a new way is, of course,  one  of  the  key  goals  of  all  modern  art,  regardless  of  the  media.       MEDIA  DESIGN    323  By substituting all constants with variables, media software insti- tutionalizes  this  desire.  Now  everything  can  always  change  and  everything can be rendered in a new way. But, of course, simple  changes in color or variations in a spatial form are not enough to  create a new vision of the world. It takes talent to transform the  possibilities  offered  by  software  into  meaningful  statements  and  original  experiences.  Lislegaard,  Blake,  and  Murata—along  with  many other talented designers and artists working today—offer us  distinct and original visions of our world in a state of continuous  transformation  and  metamorphosis:  visions  that  are  fully  appro- priate  for  our  time  of  rapid  social,  technological,  and  cultural  change.  Amplification  Although the discussions in this chapter did not cover all the changes  that took place during the Velvet Revolution, the magnitude of the  transformations  in  moving  image  aesthetics  and  communication  strategies should by now be clear. While we can name many social  factors that all could have and probably did play some role—the  rise of branding, experience economy, youth markets, and the Web  as  a  global  communication platform  during  the  1990s—I  believe  that these factors alone cannot account for the specific design and  visual logics which we see today in media culture. Similarly, they  cannot be explained by simply saying that contemporary consumer  society requires constant innovation, constant novel aesthetics, and  effects. This may be true—but why do we see these particular visual  languages as opposed to others, and what is the logic that drives  their evolution? I believe that to properly understand this, we need  to  carefully  look  at  media  creation,  editing,  and  design  software  and its use in the production environment—which can range from  one  person  with  a  laptop  to  a  number  of  production  companies  around the world with thousands of people collaborating on the  same large-scale project such as a feature film. In other words, we  need to use the perspective of Software Studies.    The makers of software used in media production usually do not  set out to create a revolution. On the contrary, software is created  to  fit  into  already  existing  production  procedures,  job  roles,  and    324   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  familiar tasks. But software applications are like species within the  common ecology—in this case, a shared environment of a digital  computer.  Once  “released,”  they  start  interacting,  mutating,  and  making  hybrids.  The  Velvet  Revolution  can  therefore  be  under- stood as the period of systematic hybridization between different  software species originally designed to do work in different media.  By 1993, designers had access to a number of programs which were  already  quite  powerful  but  mostly  incompatible:  Illustrator  for  making vector-based drawings, Photoshop for editing of continuous  tone images, Wavefront and Alias for 3D modeling and animation,  After Effects for 2D animation, and so on. By the end of the 1990s,  it  became  possible  to  use  them  in  a  single  workflow.  A  designer  could now combine operations and representational formats such  as a bitmapped still image, an image sequence, a vector drawing,  a  3D  model  and  digital  video  specific  to  these  programs  within  the  same  design.  I  believe  that  the  hybrid  visual  language  that  we see today across “moving image” culture and media design in  general is largely the outcome of this new production environment.  While  this  language  supports  seemingly  numerous  variations  as  manifested in the particular media designs, its key aesthetics feature  can  be  summed  up  in  one  idea:  deep  remixability  of  previously  separate media languages.   As  I  have  stressed  more  than  once,  the  result  of  this  hybridi- zation  is  not  simply  a  mechanical  sum  of  the  previously  existing  parts but new “species.” This applies both to the visual language  of  particular  designs  and  to  the  operations  themselves.  When  a  pre-digital media operation is integrated into the overall software  production environment, it often comes to function in a new way.  I  would  like  to  conclude  by  analyzing  in  detail  how  this  process  works in the case of a particular operation—in order to emphasize  once again that media remixability is not simply about adding the  content of different media, or adding together their techniques and  languages. And since remix in contemporary culture is commonly  understood as comprising these kinds of additions, we may want to  use a different term to talk about the kinds of transformations the  example below illustrates. I called this provisionally “deep remixa- bility,” but what is important is the idea and not a particular term.   So if you have a suggestion for a better one, send me an email.     What does it mean when we see depth-of-field effects in motion  graphics,  films  and  television  programs  which  use  neither  live       MEDIA  DESIGN    325  action  footage  nor  photorealistic  3D  graphics,  but  have  a  more  stylized  look?  Originally  an  artifact  of  lens-based  recording,  depth  of  field  was  simulated  in  software  in  the  1980s  when  the  main goal of 3D computer graphics field was to create maximum  “photorealism,” i.e. synthetic scenes not distinguishable from live  action cinematography. But once this technique became available,  media  designers  gradually  realized  that  it  can  be  used  regardless  of  how  realistic  or  abstract  the  visual  style  is—as  long  as  there  is a suggestion of a 3D space. Typography moving in perspective  through  an  empty  space;  drawn  2D  characters  positioned  on  different  layers  in  a  3D  space;  a  field  of  animated  particles—any  spatial  composition  can  be  put  through  the  simulated  depth  of  field.    The  fact  that  this  effect  is  simulated  and  removed  from  its  original  physical  media  means  that  a  designer  can  manipulate  it  in  a  variety  of  ways.  The  parameters  which  define  what  part  of  the space is in focus can be independently animated, i.e. they can  be set to change over time—because they are simply the numbers  controlling the algorithm and not something built into the optics  of a physical lens. So while simulated depth of field maintains the  memory  of  the  particular  physical  media   lens-based  photo  and  film  recording   from  which  it  came,  it  became  essentially  a  new  technique which functions as a “character” in its own right. It has  the fluidity and versatility not available previously. Its connection  to  the  physical  world  is  ambiguous  at  best.  On  the  one  hand,  it  only makes sense to use depth of field if you are constructing a 3D  space, even if it is defined in a minimal way by using only a few  or  even  a  single  depth  cue,  such  as  lines  converging  towards  the  vanishing point or foreshortening. On the other hand, the designer  is now able to “draw” this effect in any way desirable. The axis  controlling depth of field does not need to be perpendicular to the  image plane, the area in focus can be anywhere in space, it can also  quickly move around the space, etc.    In  summary,  when  we  remove  depth  of  field  from  its  original  hardware  home   photo  and  film  cameras   and  move  it  into  software, we change where and how it can be used. We can still  use it in its original context—that of lens-captured media. That is,  we can apply it to 3D computer graphics elements in order to make  them compatible with video or film captured via lens. But we can  also now use it with many other media, for purely artistic effect.    326   SOFTWARE TAKES COMMAND  And we can use it in many ways that were not even conceivable  when it was part of media hardware.    Following the Velvet Revolution, the aesthetic charge of many  media  designs  is  often  derived  from  “simpler”  remix  opera- tions—juxtaposing  different  media  in  what  can  be  called  “media  montage.” However, for me the essence of this Revolution is the  more fundamental “deep remixability,” illustrated by this example  of how depth of field was greatly amplified when it was simulated  in software.    Computerization  virtualized  practically  all  media  creation  and  modification  techniques,  “extracting”  them  from  their  particular  physical media and turning them into algorithms. This means that  in most cases, we will no longer find any of the pre-digital techniques  in  their  pure  original  state.  This  is  something  I  have  already  discussed in general when we looked at the first stage in cultural  software history, i.e. the 1960s and 1970s, examining Sutherland’s  work on the first interactive graphical editor Sketchpad, Nelson’s  concepts  of  hypertext  and  hypermedia,  and  Kay’s  discussions  of  an  electronic  book   “It  [an  electronic  book]  need  not  be  treated  as a simulated paper book since this is a new medium with new  properties” . We have now seen how this general idea articulated  already in the early 1960s made its way into the details of the inter- faces and tools of applications for media design which eventually  replaced most of traditional tools: After Effects  which we analyzed  in detail , Illustrator, Photoshop, Flash, Final Cut, etc. So what is  true for depth of field effect is also true for most other tools offered  by media design applications.    What was a set of theoretical concepts implemented in a small  number  of  custom  software  systems  accessible  mostly  to  their  own  creators  in  the  1960s  and  1970s   such  as  Sketchpad  or  the  Xerox  PARC  workstation   later  became  a  universal  production  environment  used  today  throughout  all  areas  of  the  culture  industry. The ongoing interactions between the ideas coming from  the  software  industry  and  the  desires  of  the  users  of  their  tools   media designers, graphic designers, film editors, and so on —led  to the further evolution of software—for instance, the emergence  of an new category of “digital asset management” systems around  the  early  2000s,  or  the  concept  of  “production  pipeline”  which  became  important  in  the  middle  of  this  decade.  In  this  chapter  I  have described only one among many directions of the evolution       MEDIA  DESIGN    327  of  software  applications,  their  tools,  and  media  formats.  As  we  saw, the result of this trend was the emergence of a fundamentally  new  type  of  aesthetics  which  today  dominates  visual  and  media  culture.     CONCLUSION  Software, hardware, and social media  In 1977 Alan Kay and Adele Goldberg imagined that a computer  would  become  a  “metamedium”  that  would  contain  “a  wide  range  of  already-existing  and  not-yet-invented  media.”  Exactly  as they predicted, computers have been used to invent a number  of  new  types  of  media  that  are  not  simulations  of  prior  physical  media.  The  examples  include  navigable  three-dimensional  spaces  constructed  with  computer  graphics,  media  databases,  or  “sim”  video  games  such  as  SimCity,  The  Sims,  and  Civilization.  And,  of  course,  the  Internet  in  particular  has  been  a  very  productive  host for inventing new types of communication and collaboration:  email, forums, blogs, microbloging  e.g. Twitter , wiki, RSS, social  networks, etc.    At the same time, the computer metamedium was also evolving  in  a  second  direction.  While  it  indeed  came  to  contain  “a  wide  range  of  already-existing”  media,  I  have  argued  that  once  each  of  these  media  was  simulated  in  a  computer  their  identities  changed. Sutherland, Engelbart, Nelson, Kay, and other inventors  of  computer  metamediums  understood  that  the  simulations  of  previously  existing  physical  or  electronic  media  could  add  many  new properties to these media. As Kay and Goldberg wrote in their  article, a simulated medium can become a “new medium with new  properties.”    A computer “breathes new life” into the physical and electronic  media it simulates. Media can become “dynamic”  to use another  of Kay’s terms which he preferred to “interactive” . They can also  be  “intelligent”:  think  of  Sketchpad,  which  could  automatically  “clean up” the sketches made by designers by satisfying constraints  such as parallelism. Further, they can become collectively sharable    330   CONCLUSION  and  collectively  “editable”—think  of  large-scale  social  software  projects such as Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap. Media objects such  as pictures, sound, video, text, and code can leap from machine to  machine in a truly magical fashion: from a mobile phone to a media  player, then to a memory card, a laptop, a netbook, the Web, and  so on and so on. Imagine that you live in the sixteenth century and  you are told that you can order an image in a painting to travel by  itself and appear in another painting in another country, or that a  text in one book can lift itself and replace a text in another book?  And yet this is exactly what many of us are doing every day without  even thinking how magical this is.    I  think  that  the  scale,  diversity  and  radicalism  of  these  “additions”—those  already  invented  and  many  more  yet  to  be  invented in the future—is of such magnitude that exploring what  can be created with them will occupy us for a long time. And this  is one of the reasons why the “digital revolution” is different from  all  previous  techno-cultural  revolutions.  The  ability  to  simulate  not simply one or two, but most media in a computer—combined  with computer abilities to control processes in real-time, calculate,  transform  inputs,  test  what if  scenarios,  and  send  information  over  networks—opens  a  practically  unbounded  space  of  creative  possibilities.    As  we  followed  the  evolution  of  the  computer  medium  from  the  first  stage  of  invention  and  experimentation   1960s–1970s   to  the  second  stage  of  commercialization  and  wide  adoption   1980s–1990s , we discovered the third direction of the computer  metamedium  evolution—hybridization.  Translated  into  software,  different types of media started acting like species within a common  ecology—in  this  case,  a  shared  software  environment.  Once  they  were  “released”  into  this  environment  they  begin  interacting,  mutating, and making hybrids. Both the simulated and new media  types—text,  hypertext,  still  photographs,  vector  graphics,  digital  video,  2D  animation,  3D  models  and  animation,  navigable  3D  spaces, maps, location information, messages and scripts—became  building blocks for many new media combinations. As my examples  illustrate, such hybrids can be found at different scales—from large- scale software systems such as Google Earth to the single images  and short motion graphics created by individual designers.   The  rise  of  social  media  and  social  networking  on  the  web  in  the  middle  of  the  2000s,  their  expansion  to  mobile  platforms  in       CONCLUSION   331  the next few years, and the development of apps markets for these  platforms lead to new types of hybrids. The functional elements of  social and mobile media—search, rating, wall posting, subscription,  text  messaging,  instant  messaging,  email,  voice  calling,  video  calling, etc.—form their own media ecosystem. Like the ecosystem  of techniques for media creating, editing and navigation realized in  professional media software during the 1990s, this new ecosystem  enables  further  interactions  of  its  elements.  These  elements  are  combined  in  a  variety  of  ways  on  different  platforms  and  in  different social media apps. New “features” of social and mobile  software enter this ecosystem, and expand the pool of its elements.   The technologies behind these elements, such as multi-tier web  applications and server-side scripting, make creating new combina- tions and new elements particularly easy in comparison to desktop  applications.1 While new versions of desktop applications such as  Photoshop,  InDesign  or  Maya  that  may  contain  new  techniques  are  released  infrequently,  online  applications  such  as  Facebook,  YouTube or Google Search can be updated by their companies very  frequently  both Google and Facebook update their code daily  and  new features can be added at any time.    The  competition  between  leading  social  network  services  has  been one engine of new elements as well as variations on existing  elements.  To  give  two  examples  from  2011,  Google+  introduced  the “Circles” feature to enable users to organize other people using  the  service  into  groups  and  to  control  what  they  post  and  share  with each group;2 Facebook introduced a Subscribe button to allow  its users to follow public updates from particular users they like.3  In  the  same  year,  the  new  social  photo  sharing  service  Pinterest  rose meteorically, due to its new features such as a flexible layout  of  photos  in  contrast  to  the  fixed  grid  layout  of  Facebook  and  Google+.   1  For  a  good  explanation  of  how  web  applications  work  technically,  see  http:   en.wikipedia.org wiki Web_application 2  Vic  Gundotra,  “Introducing  the  Google+  project:  Real-life  sharing,  rethought  for the web,” googleblog.blogspot.com, June 28, 2011, http:  googleblog.blogspot. com 2011 06 introducing-google-project-real-life.html 3  Meghan  Peters,  “Facebook  Subscribe  Button:  What  It  Means  for  Each  Type  of  User,”  mashable.com,  September  15,  2011,  http:  mashable.com 2011 09 15  facebook-subscribe-users .   332   CONCLUSION  While  this  book  focused  on  the  evolution  of  software  for  media  creation and editing, this evolution is intrinsically connected with  the parallel development of hardware, including desktops, and later  laptops  and  mobile  platforms,  networks,  servers,  render  farms,  video  cards,  displays,  and  so  on.  More  high  resolution  displays,  larger  and  cheaper  storage,  faster  networks,  easier  connectivity  between  devices  for  media  capture,  storage,  editing,  distribution,  and  playback—all  these  developments  automatically  extend  the  capacities of computational media, changing what can be imagined  and  designed.  For  example,  a  computer  display  with  35,840  x  8,000  pixel  resolution   e.g.  the  HIPerSpace  super-visualization  computer  that  my  lab  has  been  fortunate  to  use  since  2008   is  not  only  quantitatively  but  also  qualitatively  different  from  a  display  which  only  has  1024  x  768  pixels   the  desktop  standard  in the 1990s .4 Similarly, the experience of using the Internet via  broadband connection is qualitatively different from a modem to  dial-in via analog telephone line  also the standard in the 1990s .    When  Kay’s  colleagues  implemented  various  media  editors  on  their “interim Dynabook” in the first part of the 1970s, most of  this software could not compete with their physical and electronic  equivalent  tools.  I  remember  my  experience  working  on  a  first  generation Macintosh in 1984; it could only show sixteen levels of  grey on a 512 x 384 pixel screen measuring 9 inches. Obviously this  was not sufficient for me to immediately drop my oil brushes and  paints and switch to computers. So, in some sense, the first period  of media computerization—between the completion of Sketchpad  in 1963 and the release of PageMaker in 1985—was theoretical.  During this period, the conceptual principles and the key algorithms  necessary for detailed simulation of physical media were developed,  before the sufficiently cheap hardware was available. For instance,  during the 1960s many computer scientists learned about Sketchpad  by reading Sutherland’s PhD thesis since the machine on which it  run—the  TX-2  computer—existed  only  at  MIT.   This  is  another  interesting  characteristic  of  computer  media  revolution—it  was  theorized in detail before it occurred in practice.    available   4  Photographs of my lab’s work with the HIPerSpace super-visualization computer  are  http:  lab.softwarestudies.com 2008 12 cultural-analytics- hiperspace-and.html. The HIPerSpace computer is described at http:  vis.ucsd.edu  mediawiki index.php Research_Projects:_HIPerSpace  at       CONCLUSION   333    But during the second part of the 1990s PC hardware become  advanced enough to run simulations of most media at a sufficient  fidelity  that  was  comparable  with  the  professional  standards  already in place. This included software for graphic design, CAD,  3D  modeling,  2D  and  3D  animation,  print  layout,  digital  photo  manipulation,  and  audio  and  video  non-linear  editing.  In  many  cases,  these  applications  were  now  responding  to  users’  actions  sufficiently fast to approach the level of interactivity conceptualized  by Kay and Goldberg in 1977  although 3D animation and video  compositing  even  today  may  require  long  rendering  times .  As  a  result, simulated media became truly useful, and also accessible, to  large numbers of people outside of computer laboratories and large  media companies. Within half a decade, most culture professionals  abandoned physical media for their simulated equivalents.    When  I  visited  well-known  electronic  musician,  writer  and  artist DJ Spooky in his Tribeca apartment in New York in January  2005,  I  did  not  find  any  musical  instruments,  traditional  or  electronic.  The  only  “instrument”  Paul  Miller   aka  DJ  Spooky  That Subliminal Kid  owned was his 15-inch PowerBook laptop,  made  by  Apple.  This  was  his  “Dynabook”:  a  “self-contained  knowledge manipulator in a portable package the size and shape of  an ordinary notebook.”5 Although this “Dynabook” did not have  Smalltalk,  it  ran  another  programming  environment  which  was  powerful,  fast  and  allowed  for  visual  programming—MAX,  the  language of choice worldwide for tens of thousands of electronic  musicians,  VJs,  dancers,  theatre  performers  and  others  working  with different forms of real-time performance.   While  the  evolution  of  hardware  enabled  dissemination  of  media  software  to  professional  communities  in  the  1990s,  in  the  2000s  this  evolution  also  enabled  the  new  stage  in  software  design and use—social media  2004– . The few companies which  dominated  the  field  of  professional  media  applications   Adobe,  Apple,  Autodesk   were  joined  by  a  multitude  of  new  companies  and  countless  start-ups  focused  on  developing  tools  and  services  for the Web and mobile platforms.    The  new  software  categories  include  social  networking   e.g.  Facebook ,  micro-content  services   e.g.  Twitter ,  media  sharing   5  Kay and Goldberg, “Personal Dynamic Media,” p. 394.   334   CONCLUSION  websites   YouTube,  Vimeo,  Picasa,  Flickr,  etc. ;  consumer-level  software  for  media  organization  and  light  editing   e.g.,  iPhoto ;  blog  editors   Blogger,  WordPress ;  and  many  others.  Keep  in  mind  that  software—especially  web  and  mobile  applications  and  services  designed  for  consumers—continuously  evolves,  so  some  of  the  categories  above,  their  popularity,  and  the  features  of  particular applications and social network services may change by  the time you are are reading this. One graphic example is the shift  in  the  identity  of  Facebook.  During  2007,  it  moved  from  being  yet  another  social  media  application  that  was  competing  with  MySpace to a “social OS” that aimed to combine the functionality  of  previously  different  applications  in  one  place—replacing,  for  instance, stand-alone email software for many users.    None of the software apps and websites of the “social media era”  function in isolation. Instead, they participate in the larger ecology,  which includes search engines, recommendation engines, blogging  systems,  RSS  feeds,  and  other  web  technologies;  inexpensive  consumer  electronic  devices  for  capturing  and  accessing  media   digital  cameras,  mobile  phones,  music  players,  video  players,  digital photo frames, internet enabled TVs ; and technologies that  enable  transfer  of  media  between  devices,  people,  and  the  web   storage devices, wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi and WiMax,  and  communication  standards  such  as  USB  and  4G .  Without  this  ecology  most  web  services  and  mobile  apps  would  not  be  possible.  Therefore,  this  ecology  needs  to  be  taken  into  account  in  any  discussion  of  social  networks  and  their  software—as  well  as consumer-level content access and media development software  designed to work with web-based media sharing sites. And while  the  particular  elements  and  their  relationship  in  this  ecology  are  likely to change over time—for instance, almost all media content  may  eventually  be  available  over  computer  networks;  communi- cation  between  devices  may  similarly  become  fully  transparent;  and the very rigid physical separation between people, devices they  control, and “non-smart” passive space may become blurred—the  very  idea  of  a  technological  ecology  consisting  of  a  number  of  interacting parts which include software is not unlikely to go away  any time soon. Thus, if one day I were to write a detailed account  of  social  media,  I  would  need  to  discuss  consumer  electronics,  network  architectures  and  protocols  and  other  elements  of  this  ecology as much as the social software itself.      CONCLUSION   335  Media after software  Any  summary  of  a  100,000-word  book  of  theoretical  arguments  can’t cover all important points. However, I will risk this because I  know that even an incomplete summary will still be useful for the  readers.  Here  are  some  of  the  proposals  developed  in  this  book  about the experiences and meanings of “media” for contemporary  designers  who  create  it  using  software  applications,  and  for  the  users of interactive media applications and services:  1  The computer is not a new “medium”—it is the first   “metamedium”: a combination of existing, new, and yet to  be invented media.  This is the argument of Kay, which I  take as my starting point.    2  A “medium”  as it exists in software  is a combination   of particular techniques for generation, editing and  accessing content.  I use the generic term “access” as an  alias to the longer list of terms—navigating, browsing,  viewing, listening, reading, and interacting.  Softwarization  virtualizes already existing techniques and adds many new  ones. All these techniques together from the “computer  metamedium.” Any single “medium” uses a subset of these.      New techniques and their variations are constantly  being developed which changes the identity of each  medium that uses them. For the users of popular  commercial media software, a medium changes with each  software release.      3  “What we identify by a conceptual inertia as “properties”  of different mediums are actually the properties of media  software —their interfaces, the tools, and the techniques  they make possible for accessing, navigating, creating,  modifying, publishing and sharing media documents.”  4  Following the same logic, “properties” of any media object   are no longer fully defined by the content and formats of  the files storing the information. They now also depend  on the software used to access this object. For example,  depending on whether the same image is accessed via a  default media viewer, a consumer app for media access and    336   CONCLUSION  editing, or professional editing software such as Photoshop,  its “properties” change significantly.  5  The techniques that make up the computer metamedium  can be divided into two categories. General-purpose  i.e.  “media-independent”  techniques are implemented to work  in the similar way on all media types  for example: select,  copy, search, filter, etc.  Media-specific techniques can only  work on particular data structures  for example, you can  increase amplitude of a sound track or reduce the number  of vertices in a 3D shape, but not vice versa . Each software  “medium” combines some media-independent and some  media-specific techniques.   6  The idea of a data structure leads us to an alternative   definition of a software medium. “As defined by application  software and experienced by users, a ‘medium’ is a pairing  of a particular data structure and the algorithms for creation,  editing and viewing the content stored in this structure.”      From this perspective, each of the categories of media  development software can be said to define its own  “medium”—because the programs offered in each of  these categories typically  but not always  share the same  fundamental data structure. The examples that fit this are  vector graphics editors, raster graphics editors, 2D animation  and motion graphics software, 3D computer graphics  software, sound editors, text processors, and HTML editors.   7  Following the first stage of the computer metamedium   invention, we enter the next stage of media “hybridity” and  “deep remixability.” “The unique properties and techniques  of different media became software elements that can be  combined together in previously impossible ways.” “Both  the simulated and new media types—text, hypertext, still  photographs, digital video, 2D animation, 3D animation,  navigable 3D spaces, maps, location information—came  to function as building blocks for many new media  combinations.”     This condition is not the simple consequence of the  universal digital code used for all media types. Instead, it  is the result of the gradual development of interoperability             CONCLUSION   337  technologies including standard media file formats, import  export functions in applications, and network protocols.  8  The previous formulations lead us to view contemporary  media development using a model of biological evolution  and its concept of massive numbers of species that share  common traits—away from the modern model of a small  number of very different mediums with their unique  languages. Instead of trying to place any particular project,  app, or web service in some category selected from a small  number, we can instead view it as a combination of the  techniques selected from a very large pool. Some of these  combinations occur more often; others may only occur  once. The successful combinations become popular, leading  to similar projects; and some may become design patterns  used in numerous applications.  Software epistemology  One of the key ideas developed in this book is that the computer  metamedium is characterized by “permanent extendibility.” New  algorithms  and  techniques  that  work  with  common  media  data  types and file formats can be invented at any time by anyone with  the right skills. These inventions can be distributed instantly over  the web, without a need for the large resources that were required  in  the  twentieth  century  to  introduce  a  new  commercial  media  device  with  new  functions  or  a  new  media  format.  Use  of  open  source  and  free  software  licenses  and  web-based  hosting  services  repositories  such  as  GitHub  encourages  people  to  collectively  expand  existing  software  tools,  which  often  leads  to  their  rapid  evolution.    The  permanent  extendibility  of  the  computer  metamedium  has  important consequences not only for how we create and interact with  media, but also for the techniques of knowledge in a “computerized  society”   “Knowledge  in  Computerized  Societies”  is  the  subtitle  of  the  opening  section  of  the  celebrated  1979  book  The  Postmodern  Condition: A Report on Knowledge by Jean-François Lyotard .    Turning everything into data, and using algorithms to analyze it  changes what it means to know something. It creates new strategies    338   CONCLUSION  that  together  make  up  software  epistemology.  Epistemology  is  a  branch  of  philosophy  that  asks  questions  such  as  what  is  knowledge, how it can be acquired, and to what extent a subject  can be known. Digital code, data visualization, GIS, information  retrieval, machine learning techniques, constantly increasing speed  of  processors  and  decreasing  cost  of  storage,  big  data  analytics  technologies, social media, and other parts of the modern techno- social universe introduce new ways of acquiring knowledge, and in  the process redefine what knowledge is.   For instance, it is always possible to invent new algorithms  or  new ways to scale existing algorithms to analyze big data faster   that  can  analyze  the  already  existing  data  in  ways  the  previous  algorithms  could  not.  As  a  result,  you  can  extract  additional  patterns  and  generate  new  information  from  the  older,  already  analyzed data.   Algorithms and software applications that analyze images and  video  provide  particularly  striking  examples  of  this  capacity  to  generate  additional  information  from  the  data  years  or  even  decades after it was recorded.  In Blowup, a 1966 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, the    photographer  who  takes  pictures  of  a  couple  kissing  in  the  park  uses the strategy of printing progressive enlargements of one area  of  the  photograph,  until  a  grainy  close-up  reveals  a  body  in  the  grass and a man with a gun hiding in the trees.    During the time that this film was being created and unknown to  its director, computer science researchers were already developing  the  new  field  of  digital  image  processing,  including  algorithms  for  image  enhancement  such  as  sharpening  of  edges,  increasing  contrast, and reducing noise and blur. The early articles in the field  show the blurry photographs taken by surveillance planes, which  were sharpened by the algorithms. As I already explained earlier,  today  many  of  these  techniques  are  built  into  all  image  manipu- lation software such as Photoshop, as well as in the firmware of  digital cameras. They became essential to both consumer photog- raphy and commercial visual media, as every published photograph  in mass media first goes through some software adjustments.    Contemporary  DSLR  models  and  high-end  compact  digital  cameras can record images both in JPEG and Raw formats. With  JPEG format, an image is compressed, which limits the possibilities  for  later  extraction  of  additional  information  using  software.       CONCLUSION   339  Raw format stores the unprocessed data from the camera’s image  sensor.  The  use  of  this  format  assumes  that  a  photographer  will  later manipulate the photo in software to get the best results from  the millions of pixels recorded by the camera. In his guide for the  use of the two formats by photographers, William Porter explains:  “Working with a Raw file, you’ll have a greater chance of recov- ering highlights in overexposed clouds, rescuing detail from areas  of  shadow  or  darkness,  and  correcting  white  balance  problems.  You’ll be able to minimize your images’ noise and maximize their  sharpness, with much greater finesse.”6    This  means  that  new  software  with  better  algorithms  can  generate new information from a photo in Raw format captured  years earlier.  See the examples from Porter’s article available online  for  a  dramatic  demonstration  of  this.7   In  another  example  of  software epistemology, in the demo presented at one SIGGRAPH  annual  conferences,  a  few  film  shots  of  1940s’  Hollywood  film  were manipulated in software to re-generate the same shots from a  different point of view.   In visual effects production today, one of the most widely used  operations is the algorithmic extraction of the position of the video  camera  that  was  used  to  capture  a  shot.  This  operation  is  called  “motion tracking” and it exemplifies how information that is not  directly available in the data can be inferred by algorithms.  The  extracted camera position is used to insert computer graphics into  the live action footage in the correct perspective.     Another  important  type  of  software  epistemology  is  data  fusion—using data from different sources to create new knowledge  that  is  not  explicitly  contained  in  any  of  them.  For  example,  using  the  web  sources,  it  is  possible  to  create  a  comprehensive  description  of  an  individual  by  combining  pieces  of  information  from his her various social media profiles and making deductions  from them.    Combining  separate  media  sources  can  also  give  additional  meanings  to  each  of  the  sources.  Consider  the  technique  of  the  automatic  stitching  of  a  number  of  separate  photos  into  a  single  panorama, available in most digital cameras. Strictly speaking, the   6  William Porter, “Raw vs. JPEG: Which should you shoot and when?”, techhive. com  September 19, 2012 . 7  Ibid.   340   CONCLUSION  underlying algorithms do not add any new information to each of  the images  i.e., their pixels are not modified . But since each image  now  is  a  part  of  the  larger  panorama,  its  meaning  for  a  human  observer changes.    The abilities to generate new information from the old data, fuse  separate information sources together, and create new knowledge  from  old  analog  sources  are  just  some  techniques  of  software  epistemology. In my future publications I am hoping to gradually  describe other techniques—as I am teaching myself data mining and  other algorithmic knowledge techniques of knowledge commonly  used by contemporary software societies.  In  the  beginning  of  the  book  I  asked:  what  is  media  after    software?  If  artistic  mediums  were  traditionally  defined  by  the  techniques and representational capacities of particular tools and  machines   brushes,  ink,  paper,  musical  instruments,  a  printing  press, a photo camera, a film camera, video cameras and editing  equipment , what happens to this concept after most of these tools  and techniques are simulated in a single software environment? In  other words, what is a “medium” as defined by software applica- tions used to create, edit, distribute, and access it?   While  “media  effects,”  “media  representation,”  “media  industry,” “media theory” and “media history” have been exten- sively discussed in large number of books and articles in a number  of  academic  disciplines,  this  literature  does  not  usually  include  analysis  of  software  tools  and  platforms.  In  contrast,  the  vast  universe  of  “how  to”  books,  instructional  videos  and  tutorials  contains  very  little  theory,  because  the  goal  of  all  these  publica- tions  is  practical  instruction.   My  search  for  “Photoshop”  in  amazon.com  under  books  on  August  12,  2013  returned  9,405  publications; the search for “After Effects” returned 1,201 results,  and the search for “3ds Max” returned 1,972 results.  The aim of  my book was to help bridge the gap between these two separate  universes of theory and practice.   Following the question of what it means to create media with  software took us on a long journey through a few decades. We did  find some possible answers that I hope you have found interesting  and  provocative.  But  of  course,  since  both  this  book  and  all  my  writing  are  directed  first  of  all  to  media  practitioners—profes- sionals and students creating new software applications and tools,  graphic designs, web designs, motion graphics, animations, films,       CONCLUSION   341  space  designs,  architecture,  objects,  devices,  and  digital  art—you  can  do  more  than  simply  agree  or  disagree  with  my  analysis.  By  inventing  new  techniques,  or  through  the  innovative  application  of existing techniques—and by finding new ways to represent the  world, the human being, and the data, and new ways for people to  connect, share, and collaborate—you can expand the boundaries of  “media after software.”    INDEX  A to D see analog to digital Abel, Robert 288 Abyss, The 21, 294 ACM Digital Library 38–9 Acrobat 38, 269  8.0 188 designers 189  Acrobat Reader 195, 225 Acrobat User Interface 188 ActionScript 16 Adobe 27, 46, 93, 113, 147, 211,   283, 302, 333  website 304  Adobe Acrobat see Acrobat Adobe Bridge 144 Adobe Creative Suite 302 Adobe Photoshop Touch 26 Adobe Premiere Pro 304 Advanced Research Projects   Agency Network 183–4  aerial imagery 134 aesthetic theory 149, 150 aesthetics 4, 45, 120, 121–2, 182,   236, 244, 252, 258, 259,  277, 297, 303, 311, 318,  319, 322, 323, 324, 325  Baroque 215 hybridity 254–67 psychedelic 298  After Effects 2, 24, 39, 41, 44, 45,  46, 49, 58, 75, 84, 90, 124,  144, 179, 205, 246, 247,  248, 249, 255, 261, 278,   282–9, 291, 293, 296, 300,  302, 305, 306, 307, 310,  311, 319, 324, 325  4.0 47  After the Great Divide 250 Agre, Phil 12 Ajax techniques 218 Aldus 283 Aldus Pagemaker 41 Alexander, Amy 13–14 algorithms 114, 128, 136, 137,   138–9, 146, 179, 181, 182,  184, 197, 199–204, 215,  216, 219, 220, 222, 270,  325, 337, 338, 340  Algorithms Plus Data Structure   Equals Programs 207  Alias 41, 44, 148, 290, 311, 324 AliasWavefront 148 Alice in Wonderland 259 Alien 294 Alsace 185, 187, 191, 196, 197,   237  Amazon 7, 9, 35, 92, 190, 191 Amazon Kindle 109 amplification 323–7 analog to digital 153 Anderson, Peter 299, 303 Android 7, 24, 26, 29, 182, 228 animation 29, 129, 145, 170 Anime Music Video 46 Antonioni, Michelangelo 338 Apeloig, Philippe 300, 303   344   INDEX  Aperture 24, 124, 144, 225 API 190, 191, 237 App Store 108 Apple 6, 7, 39, 47, 57, 84, 85, 93,   105, 107, 108, 109, 147,  164, 225, 333  statistics 108  Apple IIe 20 AppleScript 211 apps 9, 17, 24, 25, 31, 47, 50,   108, 124, 148  architecture 41 Architecture Machine Group 161 Arns, Inke 14 ARPANET see Advanced   Research Projects Agency  Network  art 162 Art+Com 170, 187, 192 Artstor 228 artworks 139 ASCII text 209 Aspen Movie Map 80, 161, 164,   165, 176, 181  Asympote 312 Atari 84 Atkinson, Bill 105 authoring 163 AutoCAD 41, 44, 75, 312 Autodesk 27, 85, 283, 333 automation 128, 129 Avatar 259 Avid 59, 283  Bach, J.
