my brother and I bought a computer. My mom thought  we were crazy, because it didn’t do anything. She was right. There was very little software available. We spent many nights typing in programs  usually games . They almost never worked when we finished typing, so we always had to look back carefully over the code. Eventually, we were able to fix typographical mistakes and make the games work. Then, we found ourselves changing the code, so we could improve the games that we were typing in.  That was a great way to learn how to program. We were working in a simple language without too many confusing options. We were writing games that were even more fun to play because we had crafted them ourselves. We were able to combine both logical think- ing and our creative drives. Game programming was especially rewarding, because the results were programs that we actually wanted to use. Our skills improved because game programming provided lots of challenges. We later found that the skills we learned by developing games were very useful in more “serious” applications as well.  Today it would appear difficult to learn programming in the same way that my brother and  I  did.  Computers  are  much  more  complicated  than  that  old  machine  that  my brother and I used. Programming languages have become far more complex at the same time, and the programmer’s toolbox of compilers, integrated environments, and debuggers seems expensive, complex, and forbidding to somebody who just wants to get started and play around a little bit.  Still, it is possible to learn to program in almost the same way. A new crop of beginner- friendly languages is popping up. Specifically, the JavaScript language has emerged as a new programming language perfect for beginners who want to see what programming is all about, and who want to learn in a non-threatening but real way. JavaScript is em- bedded into popular Web browsers, so the language costs nothing. It is available on nearly every major type of computer system. The language has a reasonably straightforward syntax that provides beginners a gentle introduction to some important modern con- cepts, such as object-oriented and event-based programming. It also does not have so many features that it requires a degree in computer science to understand.  The purpose of this book is to teach you the main principles of programming. You will learn the major concepts used in most programming languages, and you will apply them specifically in JavaScript. I will use the context of game programming to teach the concepts, but you will find that you can use the techniques for purposes far be- yond game programming. If you already know JavaScript, you will still probably find some new ideas in the descriptions of game programming. If you have already done some game development, you might be surprised at the things that you can do with   xiv  n o i t c u d o r t n I  JavaScript. If both areas are new to you, you’re going to have a great time exploring some new things.  Although you will probably not immediately make a million dollars selling computer games, I think that you will find this book’s approach reasonably friendly. You will also see that you can easily apply the skills that you learn more generally to other kinds of more serious programming. Besides, the addition of a game to a Web site can drastically improve its popularity, making game programming a very practical skill for any Webmaster.  I am not presuming that you have any programming experience at all. I do expect that  you  are  comfortable  with  HTML  and  that  you  know  how  to  build  Web  pages with a plain text editor. You should have a good text editor, a graphics editor, and a sound editor. The CD-ROM that accompanies this book has examples of all these pro- grams. Of course, you will need access to a computer that can run these programs. You will be running your programs in a Web browser, so you should have access to recent versions of Netscape Navigator  4.0+  and Internet Explorer  5.0+ . Some of the later examples in this book take advantage of gameLib, a special programming li- brary. The CD-ROM includes a copy of gameLib. Finally, if you wish to publish your pages, you will need access to some sort of Web server.  How to Use This Book To learn how to program a computer, you must acquire a complex progression of skills. If you have never done any programming at all, you will probably find it easiest to go through the chapters in order. Of course, if you are already an experienced programmer, it might not be necessary to do any more than skim the earliest chapters. In either case, programming is not a skill you can learn by reading. You’ll have to write programs to learn. This book has been designed to make the process reasonably painless.  Each chapter begins with a complete program that demonstrates some key ideas for the chapter. Then, you’ll look at a series of smaller programs that illustrate each of the major points of the chapter. Finally, you’ll put these concepts together to build the larger program that you saw at the opening of the chapter. You’ll be able to see impor- tant ideas in simple, straightforward code, and you’ll also see more involved programs that put multiple ideas together. All the programs are short enough that you can type them in yourself  which is a great way to look closely at code , but they are also avail- able on the CD-ROM.  Throughout the book, I’ll throw in a few other tidbits, notably the following:  H I N T  T R A P  These are good ideas that experienced programmers like to pass on.  There are a few areas where it’s easy to make a mistake. I’ll point them out to you as you go.  IN THE REAL WORLD  As  you  examine  the  games  in this book, I’ll show you how the concepts are used for purposes beyond game development.   T R I C K  These will suggest techniques and shortcuts that will make your life as a programmer easier.  E X E R C I S E S  At the end of each chapter, I’ll suggest some programs that you can write with the skills you’ve learned so far. This should help you start writing your own programs.  xv  I n t r o d u c t i o n    C H A P T E R  1  Variables, Input,  and Output  P rogramming  is  nothing  more  than  controlling in a more direct way what you want your computer to do. You prob- ably already use a computer in a number of ways, and you control it to some extent by the programs you use and the way that you use them. Still, with- out programming, you are always at the mercy of the programs designed by others. In this chapter, you will look at how you can begin to influence the computer’s behavior. Specifically, you will:    Examine how you can put code inside a  HyperText Markup Language  HTML  page    Use dialog boxes to interact with the user    Learn how computers store data in variables    Learn how to get data from the user    Perform basic operations on data   The Project: Name Game In Figure 1.1, a special box pops up in a normal Web page that asks the user for his or her name. Then, a series of other boxes pop up, asking for a last name and then finding other ways to manipulate the name.  2  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 1.1  By the end of this chapter, you will be able to create this simple name game.   No game publishers will throw money at you after this effort, as the game itself is not exactly thrilling. However, even this mildly interesting game elevates your Web page far above the ordinary. Most Web pages do not enable the user to interact with them at all, so this page immediately stands out as something special, even though what it does is kind of pointless and silly. Don’t underestimate the power of the Web page appearing to know your user. It can make the page seem much more personal to the visitor. You can add this functionality to any Web page you have, and your users will think you’re really clever.  Adding Code to HTML Web pages provide a rich background for programming. With the knowledge of HTML that you already have, you can generate pages that look pretty good. For example, you can control how text looks and add images. You might even have some experience with the finer-grained control of cascading style sheets. Still, plain HTML pages lack true interactivity. The only way that the user can really exert any control over the page is by clicking on links. This is interesting, but that fun takes the user only so far.  Creating the Hello, World! Application It would be interesting to make the page a little more dynamic. Both of the major browsers, Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, support JavaScript, a scripting language that is perfect for adding interactive features to a Web page. Take a look at the following snippet of code:  3  C h a p t e r 1  V a r i a b l e s  ,   I n p u t ,       a n d O u t p u t                           hello world           the classic first program         alert "hello world" ;                  If you save this code as a Web page, then load that page into a browser, it generates the screen shown in Figure 1.2.  This code snippet consists of normal  if very abbre- viated  HTML, but it uses some features you might not have seen before. The     tag set specifies to the browser that any code between the tags is not written in HTML, but in a scripting language.  Both  the  Netscape  Navigator  and Microsoft Internet Explorer browsers use JavaScript, their default language, unless you specify another language.  Technically, Microsoft Internet Explorer runs  a  variant  called  Jscript,  but  the  code  works the same as either JavaScript or Jscript.   You  can  place  script  tags  anywhere  in  an  HTML document. All of the code between    and  IN THE REAL WORLD  Although  users  typically  don’t love  things  popping  up  and interrupting the flow of the pro- gram, alert boxes are useful for a  number  of  reasons.  First, they’re  very  easy  to  program. Some of the more graceful ways of talking to the user require a little more effort. Second, they do succeed in getting the user’s attention.  Third,  you  will  find them an important utility as you program.  For  example,  you might often want the program to pause momentarily and send you  a  message  about  itself  as you are testing it.   4  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 1.2  When the Web page  is loaded into the browser, a special  box pops up.    is written according to the rules of JavaScript. JavaScript is a different lan- guage than HTML, and its rules are different.  The    characters denote a comment. The interpreter ignores anything that follows on a line that begins with these characters. However, the information that programmers provide in comments is still critical. Comments are mainly for the benefit of the pro- grammer. It’s a great idea to add lots of comments to your programs, because good comments can make your code much easier to repair. This particular program has lots of comments. They explain what the program is intended to do. Such comments are always  a  good  way  to  begin  documenting  your  program.  You’ll  look  at  some  other useful places to put comments as the code becomes more complex later in this book.  Sending a Message to the User Only one line of the code fragment does anything particularly interesting:  alert "hello world" ;  You use the alert statement to send a special kind of message. The message pops up in its own box, called a dialog box. The dialog box is pretty insistent. If you try to click on the page before you close the dialog box, it will ding at you with a sound, but it will refuse to do anything else.  The box will not close, and the other programs on your desktop will not receive the focus. It will insist that you respond to it in some way before you go on to other things in the browser.  You might have noticed the semicolon character  ;  at the end of the alert line. This character indicates the end of the alert statement. Most lines of JavaScript code end with the semicolon. The comments did not need a semicolon, because the compiler ignores them. You’ll see some other places later where a semicolon is not needed at the end of a line, but for now it’s fine simply to assume that most lines require this character at the end.   Using Variables One of the most important aspects of programming to learn is how the computer uses data. Data is defined as the information that the computer collects and manipulates. In your first few programs, the data will be text, such as names or phrases. Later in this chapter, you will learn how to use other kinds of data, such as numbers. Programming languages  use  something  called variables  as  a  tool  for  managing  data.  In  the  next section, you will see how variables are used to store information.  Creating the Hello, Joe! Application Take a look at the program shown in Figure 1.3. It shows an example of output with a  new  twist:  This  time,  the  computer  generates  a  message  already  stored  in  the computer’s memory.  This program’s code looks like this:  5  C h a p t e r 1  V a r i a b l e s  ,   I n p u t ,       a n d O u t p u t   Hello Joe                Hello, Joe        hello Joe    Demonstrate basic variable concepts    Andy Harris, 09 00  var greeting;  greeting = "Hi there, Joe";  alert greeting ;           Essentially, this program stores the text “Hi there, Joe,” then displays the message to the user as soon as the Web page is loaded into the browser. This program illustrates how the computer can store information for later retrieval. A special kind of element called a variable is the secret.  Computers essentially work with information. It’s important to understand how com- puters store the information.  Think of it this way: If you carry a lunch to work or school, you probably don’t just grab a handful of last night’s leftovers and carry them around in your hands until lunch- time. Instead, you probably use some kind of container, such as a sack. You put the lunch in the container, which you then carry around until it’s time to eat. You don’t actually deal with the food until lunch, because it’s easier to work with the container than the actual food  that is, you would rather carry the sack containing the food than carry the various items of your lunch individually . Variables fulfill a similar function for the computer. They hold information until the computer needs to work with it.   6  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 1.3  A greeting to Joe  pops up.  You’ll learn a lot more about variables later. For now, you simply need to understand that whenever you want the computer to have some information, such as a user’s name, a message, or a rate, you’ll need to use a variable.  Using the var Statement Every computer language provides some kind of support for variables. In JavaScript, programmers use the var statement to create a new variable. When you create a vari- able, you need to give it a name. This is just like putting labels on the food containers in your refrigerator. When you look at the label, you can see what is inside without having to open the container. Take another look at this statement, which occurs in the preceding Hello Joe program:  var greeting;  The term var indicates that the computer should create a variable. The word greeting is the name that I gave the variable. This line ends with a semicolon, as most lines do. After interpreting this line of code, the computer generates in memory a chunk of space named greeting. Thereafter, you can write code that writes new values to the memory chunk, and write code that reads the values from the chunk.  Guidelines for Naming Variables Computer programmers get to name a lot of things. Experienced programmers have established a few naming conventions. You might want to keep these guidelines in mind:  Be careful about case. In many languages  including JavaScript , username, userName, and USERNAME are all completely different variable names.   7  C h a p t e r 1  V a r i a b l e s  ,   I n p u t ,       a n d O u t p u t  Make names descriptive. You probably shouldn’t use a name such as r or x, because later it will be hard to remember exactly what the variable is supposed to contain. Names such as taxRate or greeting will make your code much easier to follow.  Don’t use spaces or punctuation. Most languages don’t allow multiword variable names. Many programmers use capitalization  taxRate  or underscore characters  tax_rate  to make multiple word variable names easier to read.  I’ll use the capitalization conven- tion in this book.  Many of the punctuation characters have special meanings, so it’s not a good idea to put these in a variable name.  Don’t make your variable names so long that they are impossible to type correctly. Many programmers prefer variable names from 5 to 15 characters long.  Assigning a Value to a Variable Take a look at this line from the Hello Joe program:  greeting = "Hi there, Joe";  Essentially, this line assigns the text “Hi there, Joe” to the variable  greeting. Every- thing between the quotation marks is called a string literal.  Computer programmers love to give complicated names to simple ideas. Get used to it!  String is the term that computer programmers use for text, because computers handle text as a string of char- acters. Literal means that you are actually specifying the literal value "Hi there, Joe".  The equals sign  =  indicates assignment. It might make more sense to read this state- ment as follows:  greeting gets the string literal "Hi there, Joe".  T R A P  It would not be exactly correct to say that greeting equals "Hi there, Joe". Equality is an entirely different issue, which I will deal with in the next chapter.  Finally, the word  greeting is the name of a variable that gets the string value "Hi there, Joe".  If you want to give a variable a particular value, you can do so by using a similar assign- ment statement. Coding a variable assignment statement is like putting leftovers in a container.  Using the Contents of a Variable You carry a lunch bag to keep all your food items neatly in one place. If you pull your lunch bag out of the refrigerator, you are in effect pulling out the entire lunch. In a similar way, you specify a variable’s name to refer to a variable. Take another look at this line:  alert greeting ;  When the user runs this Web page, he or she does not see the term “greeting” pop up. Instead, he or she sees “Hi there, Joe,” which is the content of the greeting variable. It doesn’t matter what the value of greeting is, as long as it is some kind of text. This line of code can output any value stored in the variable greeting.   Getting Input from the User In addition to sending information to the user, computers can also retrieve informa- tion from the user. This kind of exchange is called input.  H I N T  Sometimes people get confused about whether something is input or output. For example, suppose that you are reading a text message on a computer screen. As you read the message, you input it to your brain; however, from the computer’s per- spective, that message is output to the screen. The convention in programming is that when you talk about either input or output, you are speaking from the point of view of the computer.  Creating the Hello User! Application Take a look at this program, which illustrates a simple kind of input:  This time, the computer asks the user his or her name and uses that information in another statement.  Here’s the code that made this happen:  8  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i   Hello User                Hello, User        hello user    ask user for name    Andy Harris, 09 00  var userName;  alert userName ;           userName = prompt "What is your name?" ;  This program has a variable, but this time a value embedded in the program does not determine the variable. Instead, the user gets an opportunity to enter a value into a special dialog box, and the program copies whatever the user types to the variable. Now that you can get values from the user, you can create programs that are much more flexible. For example, you can create a program that calls the user by name, even if you have no idea what that name will be when you write the program  see Figure 1.4 .   9  C h a p t e r 1  V a r i a b l e s  ,   I n p u t ,       a n d O u t p u t  FIGURE 1.4  This program asks the user for his or her name, then  returns that input in another dialog box.  Using the prompt Statement The secret weapon that makes it possible to let the user enter data into a variable is the prompt statement. It is used in this line:  userName = prompt "What is your name?" ;  As you can see, the line starts out much like the assignment statement in the Joe pro- gram, but this time, the value that the program is sending to userName is not a literal value, but the result of some kind of operation.  The prompt statement causes a dialog box much like the alert box to pop up. This dia- log box is different, however, because it not only sends a message to the user, it also provides a place for the user to type a response.  The primary purpose of a prompt statement is to get a value back. Every prompt state- ment includes some sort of variable, ready to catch the value.  Think of eating your lunch at a cafeteria. You have to get a tray to hold your lunch, but then you have some choices. You tell the person behind the counter what item of food you want, and he or she then places that selection on your tray. Much like a tray holds your food selection, your variable provides a place in which to input a value.  An input statement, such as the prompt statement you have seen in this example, is used when you are going to fill up a variable with the answer to some kind of question. In later chapters you will see some other forms of input.  The prompt statement calls up a dialog box that presents the user with a question and a place to type an answer. It is almost always used as part of an assignment statement to assign the user’s answer to some variable.  T R I C K  When you generate a prompt dialog box, you need to determine the question that you want to ask, and you also need to have a variable ready in which to store the answer.   10  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Saying Hi to the User Now that you have a variable that contains the user’s name, it is a reasonably simple task to return that value to the user. The following line does the trick:  alert userName ;  Because userName is not in quotes, the computer interprets it as a variable name and displays to the user the contents of the userName variable. Of course, the contents pro- vide a pretty limited greeting, but you’ll fix that in the next section.  If you did put quotes around userName, the actual value “userName” is what the user would see, rather than the value associated with the userName variable.  Building More Complicated Text It would be much nicer if the greeting could be friendlier. If the user’s name is Susan, maybe the program should say “Hi, Susan!!” Figure 1.5 shows the enhanced program’s output.  Creating the Concatenation Program To create the screen shown in Figure 1.5, you must combine string literals  the “Hi,” part and the “!!” part  with the value of a variable. Specifically, you will create userName and give it a value just as you did in the previous example. The only difference is the output. The earlier program’s only output was the value of the variable, without any other text around it. In this program, you’ll figure out a way to include the value of a variable inside other text.  Concatenating Strings Creating this program requires a process that is another instance in which program- mers have given a simple idea a complicated name:  String Concatenation: The combination of two or more text strings. They can be string literals or string variables  or the values of string expressions, which you will learn about later . In JavaScript, you concatenate strings by using the plus sign  + .  FIGURE 1.5  Now the greeting  integrates the user’s name into another string.   11  C h a p t e r 1  V a r i a b l e s  ,   I n p u t ,       a n d O u t p u t  String concatenation is a lot simpler than it sounds. Here’s how the code looks:   concatenation                Concatenation        concatenation    ask user for name    Andy Harris, 09 00  var userName;  var greeting;  alert greeting ;           T R I C K  userName = prompt "What is your name?" ;  greeting = "Hi, " + userName + "!!";  If you are testing a page and you want to see it again after it’s finished, just click the browser’s Refresh button.  Joining Variables and Literals The concatenation program uses two variables: userName is meant to hold the user’s name, and greeting contains the text that the program will output to the user. The program obtains userName from the user through a prompt statement, just as in the previous program. This is the only new line:  greeting = "Hi, " + userName + "!!";  By now you should recognize that the program assigns a value to greeting. To form that value, the program concatenates the string literal “Hi,” with the contents of the userName variable and joins another string literal  “!!”  to the end of that one. You can use string concatenation to make really long, complex text strings. The great thing is that the user won’t ever know that you did any manipulations. He or she will just see that the program used his or her name.  Working with Numbers Computers are pretty good at working with text values. They are even better at work- ing with numbers. Deep inside the computer, text and numbers are stored the same way, but programmers use many schemes and conventions to encode data.  If you re- ally want the details, consult your neighborhood computer scientist.  JavaScript is pretty good at hiding this complexity from users and even programmers. It generally guesses   whether  you  are  talking  about  numbers  or  text.  Still,  sometimes  you’ll  need  to  do some special tricks to help JavaScript guess correctly.  Creating the Adder Application The program shown in Figure 1.6 provides a handy service. It looks at the cost of a meal, adds a 15 percent tip, and calculates the total bill.  This program does its work with variables, as you can see from the code:  12  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i   Adder    The Adder                    Adder    Demonstrates how a computer does math  var meal = 22.50;  var tip = meal * .15;  var total = meal + tip;  alert  "the meal is $" + meal ;  alert  "the tip is $" + tip ;  alert  "Total bill: $" + total ;           FIGURE 1.6  The Adder program displays the cost of  a meal, the tip amount, and the  total cost.   T R I C K  If a program doesn’t work right in Internet Explorer, a dialog box will take you to an editor. In Netscape, if you type javascript: into the URL area, you’ll get a dialog box showing information about any errors that Netscape Navigator detects.  Using Numeric Variables The Adder program has variables, but their values are not text. In this program, you want the computer to do mathematical computations on the data, so the variables must be numeric. Notice that there are no quotation marks around the value 22.50.  Also, you can combine the var statement with an assignment statement, so the vari- able immediately has some kind of value.  The following line calculates the value of the variable tip by multiplying meal by .15  or 15 percent :  var tip = meal * .15;  In computing, the asterisk  *  usually means multiplication.  The following line creates the total variable:  var total = meal + tip;  This statement adds up the contents of meal and tip, then places the sum in the total variable.  The alert statements work just as you would expect. The program automatically con- verts all the numbers to text when generating the output.  Diagnosing the Bad Adder Application This program would be more useful if it allowed the user to enter the cost of the meal. Look at this variant of the Adder code:  13  C h a p t e r 1  V a r i a b l e s  ,   I n p u t ,       a n d O u t p u t   BadAdd    The BadAdd                    BadAdd    Demonstrates a potential pitfall    Andy Harris, 09 00  var meal;  var tip = meal * .15;  var total = meal + tip;    get the cost of the meal from the user   14  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  meal = prompt "How much was the meal?" ;  var tip = meal * .15;  var total = meal + tip;  alert  "the meal is $" + meal ;  alert  "the tip is $" + tip ;  alert  "Total bill: $" + total ;           The program looks reasonable, but the results, as shown in Figure 1.7, are definitely not  what  you  wanted.  Something  went  wrong  somewhere.  Before  reading  on,  see whether you can figure out the problem.  Interpreting Numbers and Text Here’s what happened: The prompt statement returns a string value. The computer stores this value as text, which is no problem until you try to do math on it. In the following line, meal gets a string value, because that’s what the prompt statement returns:  meal = prompt "How much was the meal?" ;  The following line multiplies the value of meal by .15:  var tip = meal * .15;  FIGURE 1.7  This time the user gets to enter the  cost of the meal, but  the program’s calculations are  incorrect.   It doesn’t make sense to multiply by a string value, so JavaScript simply converts the string  meal  to  a  number,  and  the  multiplication  works.  The  next  line  is  where  the problems begin:  var total = meal + tip;  The computer still interprets meal as a string and tip as a number. The problem is the plus sign  + , which is an operator that tells the computer to add up numbers.  If the plus sign is used in the context of string variables, it will concatenate the strings. In this statement, the plus sign has a number on one side and a string on the other, so it confuses the computer. In this case, the computer decides to treat both values as strings and concatenate them. So, the result of concatenating “22.50” and “3.375” is another string value, “22.503.375”.  Creating the Good Adder Application JavaScript provides a number of ways to solve this problem, but the easiest is the eval   function. Take a look at this version of the code:  15  C h a p t e r 1  V a r i a b l e s  ,   I n p u t ,       a n d O u t p u t                   GoodAdd  var meal;   GoodAdd    The GoodAdd     Demonstrates eval function    Andy Harris, 09 00    get the cost of the meal from the user  meal = prompt "How much was the meal?" ;    convert the value to a number  meal = eval meal ;  var tip = meal * .15;  var total = meal + tip;  alert  "the meal is $" + meal ;  alert  "the tip is $" + tip ;  alert  "Total bill: $" + total ;            16  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 1.8  The user enters the cost of the meal, and the program  calculates  everything correctly.  There’s only one new thing in the code. That is this line:  meal = eval meal ; This statement simply evaluates the string value that the user entered. The program reassigns that result to the meal variable. In this case, the program returns a numeric value. Look at the results shown in Figure 1.8, and you’ll see that the program now works correctly.  Using String Methods In addition to enabling you to manipulate numbers, most programming languages allow you to manipulate text inside string variables. Most languages have features that you can use to change a variable to uppercase or lowercase, commands that allow you to determine the length of a string, and techniques for concatenating strings. You can combine all these feature, commands, and techniques, along with input and output, to generate your old friend, the Name Game program, from the beginning of the chap- ter. First, however, Table 1.1 reviews the new syntax you’ve learned in this chapter.   alert msg   alert "Hi there" ;  var varName = value  var userName = "";  Statement  var varName  varName = prompt   question   stringVar.  toUpperCase    stringVar.length  TABLE 1.1 SYNTAX SUMMARY  Description Create a variable called varName. Create a variable called varName with a starting value of value. Send the string msg to the user in a dialog box. Send a dialog box with the string question and a text box. Then return the value to varName. Evaluate the string expression. If it’s a number, return the number. Convert stringVar to all uppercase letters.  Example  var userName;  userName =  prompt "What is  your name" ;  bigName =  userName.  toUpperCase    Return the number of characters in the stringVar variable.  nameSize =  userName.length  eval string   number = eval "3" ;  17  C h a p t e r 1  V a r i a b l e s  ,   I n p u t ,       a n d O u t p u t  Returning to the Name Game Remember the Name Game program that you learned about at the very beginning of the chapter? Take another look at that program. You should now recognize that the program’s code demonstrates many of the concepts that you’ve learned in this chap- ter. You’ll also spot a few new things.   The Name Game                       nameGame   The Name Game     plays around with user's name   18  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i    uses string methods  var firstName = "";  var lastName = "";  var numLetters = 0;  firstName = prompt "Hi, what's your first name?", "" ;  alert  "That's a nice name, " + firstName ;  alert  "I think I'll shout it:  " + firstName.toUpperCase   ;  lastName = prompt "So what's your last name, " + firstName + "?" ;  alert  "Oh. " + firstName + " " + lastName + "." ;  alert  "Sometimes called " + lastName + ", " + firstName ;  numLetters = firstName.length + lastName.length;  alert  "Did you know there are " + numLetters + " letters in your name?" ;           You have seen most of this code before. Basically it is nothing more than some input and output statements and a few new string manipulation tricks.  Writing the Variable Creation Lines The first few lines simply create all the variables you will need:  var firstName = "";  var lastName = "";  var numLetters = 0; Programs typically begin with some comments followed by statements that create the variables for your code. Most other statements depend on variables, so it’s sensible to create them all first. It’s also nice to place them somewhere easy to find. Then, when your code gets longer, it’s easy to spot which variables you have working.  Note that when creating variables, I give them a default value. JavaScript doesn’t re- quire that you choose whether a variable will contain text or a number, but it still matters. I like to initialize those variables that I intend to be strings with the "" value, and if I expect a variable to be a number, I initialize it with 0.  Converting to Uppercase After the program obtains the user’s first name, it does some manipulation:  alert  "I think I'll shout it:  " + firstName.toUpperCase   ;  In JavaScript, sometimes variables have special powers. Strings have a bunch of things they can do, called methods. You’ll spend much more time with them later, but for now it’s fun to explore a few and see what they do. The command firstName.toUpperCase   converts the value of the firstName variable to all uppercase letters. The command then concatenates that value to the end of the string "I think I'll shout it:  ".   19  C h a p t e r 1  V a r i a b l e s  ,   I n p u t ,       a n d O u t p u t  Concatenating Complex Strings in Input and Output You can see in this code that complex string concatenation is common in input and output statements. The following prompt statement includes two literal values and a variable in the question:  lastName = prompt "So what's your last name, " + firstName + "?" ;  Such complex string concatenation is completely legal, and often a good idea.  Counting the Letters in Strings The last alert statement tells how many letters are in the user’s name. Here’s how that works:  numLetters = firstName.length + lastName.length;  numLetters is a numeric variable. firstName.length returns the number of characters in the firstName variable. Likewise, lastName.length returns the number of charac- ters in lastName. The program adds these values together and stores the total in the numeric variable numLetters.  H I N T  You might be curious why  stringName.toUpperCase   has parentheses at the end of the command whereas  stringName.length does not. This is be- cause length is technically not a method of string variables, but a property. The distinction will be much more important later in this book. For now, it’s enough to just recognize the pattern.  Combining Numbers and Text At this point, you might be very anxious about when something is a number and when it’s a string. Don’t panic. JavaScript is a very friendly language. It tries to guess what you mean, and it is often correct. Test your programs, and if you see a concatenation happen when you are expecting an addition, use the eval statement on the variables that JavaScript should interpret as numbers. If you have numbers that your program needs to concatenate to a string, that concatenation generally happens automatically, as in this line:  alert  "Did you know there are " + numLetters + " letters in your name?" ;  Summary In just one chapter, you have learned a lot. You have seen how you can embed JavaScript programs inside Web pages. You’ve looked at output with the  alert statement, and input with the prompt statement. You’ve learned about variables and literal values. You have begun to explore some of the operations you can do with numbers and strings.  In the next chapter, you’ll begin to see how computers can make choices based on the value of variables. You will also look at how to generate random numbers. These skills, along with those you’ve already learned, form the foundation for all game programming.   E X E R C I S E S  1. Write a JavaScript program that will ask the user for his or her first name, last name, and middle initial. Return them back in the order of last name, first name, and middle initial, then in first name, middle initial, and last name format.  2. Write a program that asks the user for two numbers, adds them up, and returns the result  to the user.  3. Improve the preceding program so that it also does subtraction, multiplication, and divi- sion on the two numbers.  Hint: Division uses the   symbol, and multiplication uses *.   4. Have a program ask the user his or her name and shoe size. Determine the user’s “lucky number” by multiplying the number of letters in his or her name by the shoe size. Return the results.  5. Create a program that asks the user for the height and width of a rectangle and then  returns the area  h * w  and perimeter  2* h+w  .  20  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i   The Fortune Teller: Random Numbers  C H A P T E R  2  and the if Statement In the last chapter, you learned how to  get data from the user, how to manipu- late that data, and how to send output back to the user. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to do even more with data. Specifically, you’ll learn how to:    Generate random numbers    Manipulate those numbers to be within  a specific range    Build a condition    Use conditions to branch program logic    Build more complex conditional structures   The Project: The Fortune Teller Figure 2.1 shows the Fortune Teller program, which generates a random fortune for the user every time that the page is loaded.  Getting Random Numbers Games are most interesting when they are not completely predictable. Game program- mers frequently use random numbers to simulate the unpredictability of the real world. The ability to generate random numbers in any specified range is an important skill for game programmers.  Creating the Number Maker Program The Number Maker program  see Figure 2.2  is very limited, yet it gives you the founda- tion of many games. Every time that you load the page, you will get a new random number between 0 and 1. Although such numbers aren’t entirely useful by themselves,  22  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 2.1  The Fortune Teller program generates a random fortune for the user each time  that the page is  loaded.  FIGURE 2.2  The Number Maker program generates a random number  between zero  and one.   23  C h a p t e r 2  T h e   F o r t u n e   T e l l e r :          R a n d o m N u m b e r s a n d   t h e   i f   S t a t e m e n t  they do turn out to be very flexible. As you’ll see shortly, you can do some clever tricks to use random numbers for other, more practical applications, such as dice.  Take a look at the code for the Number Maker, to see how it works:   numberMaker               numberMaker     Andy Harris  var number;     Demonstrates the random number generator  number = Math.random  ;  alert  "Here's my number: " + number ;          numberMaker                       Hit the Reload key to see a new number!   As you can see, this code includes very little that is new, except for one line. Clearly, number is a variable that gets a value, but this value is neither acquired from the user nor directly coded by the programmer. The value of the number variable comes from the Math.random   line.  Using the Math Object JavaScript is referred to as an object-based language. The exact implications of this will become far more important in later chapters, but you have already begun to see the importance of objects. Recall from the last chapter that string variables are objects that have methods attached to them. An object is some sort of entity, and a method is something that the object can do.  JavaScript supplies the Math object. This object just holds a bunch of interesting  if you like math  methods and properties. Any time you are looking for some kind of math function  such as calculating the cosine of an angle, or figuring out a logarithm or power , you might check in the Math object for a useful function. Table 2.1 describes many of these functions.   24  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  TABLE 2.1 USEFUL METHODS AND PROPERTIES OF THE MATH OBJECT  Method  abs    ceil    cos    floor    max    min    pow    Example  Result Description 3 Calculates the absolute value.

The number will be some value between 0 and 1. Most lan- guages have some form of random number generation, and it is very common for such functions to return this kind of zero-to-one value. Specifically, the following line gets a random value and copies it to the number variable:  number = Math.random  ;  H I N T  Technically, the values are only pseudorandom, because they are derived by a com- plex mathematical formula based on the current time. That’s not usually a problem, because they are close enough to truly random for game development.  Making Specialized Random Numbers Now you can generate a zero-to-one value, but such values aren’t terribly interesting. Usually, you will need numbers to be within some other kind of range. If you are creat- ing a dice game, for example, you might want the values to be between 1 and 6.   25  C h a p t e r 2  T h e   F o r t u n e   T e l l e r :          R a n d o m N u m b e r s a n d   t h e   i f   S t a t e m e n t  FIGURE 2.3  Two dialog boxes generated by the Die Roller program.  Creating the Die Roller Take a gander at the Die Roller program, which simulates rolling one six-sided die. Figure 2.3 shows a couple of runs of the program, just so you can see how it works.  The program generates a value between 0 and 1, then does various manipulations on that value to turn it into an integer between 1 and 6. This particular program prints the intermediate steps, although the user usually would not be concerned about how the program generated the number.  The code for the Die Roller program is as follows:     converts random numbers to six-sided die   dieRoller               dieRoller     Andy Harris  var rollRaw = 0;  var rollBigger = 0;  var rollInt = 0;  var rollFinal = 0;  var result = "";  rollRaw = Math.random  ;  rollBigger = rollRaw * 6;  rollInt = Math.floor rollBigger ;  rollFinal = rollInt + 1;  result = "rollRaw: " + rollRaw + "\n";  result += "rollBigger: " + rollBigger + "\n";  result += "rollInt: " + rollInt + "\n";   26  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  result += "rollFinal: " + rollFinal + "\n";  alert result ;                dieRoller                The program starts, as usual, with a number of variable creation statements. I made a bunch of variables to handle the various steps of the number conversion process. Al- though having so many variables is not absolutely necessary, it does sometimes make the code a little more clear. The  result variable is intended as a string, but all the other variables are numeric. Although JavaScript isn’t fussy about variable types, my convention is to indicate at least what type of data I expect the variable to hold.  Getting the Raw Value The first step in the process is to get the raw  zero-to-one real number  value. You saw this done in the last project, and you see in this code a now-familiar line:  rollRaw = Math.random  ;  This line of code generates a zero-to-one random value and assigns it to the variable rollRaw.  Making Larger Numbers You now have a zero-to-one value with a lot of digits behind the decimal point stored in rollRaw. You’re looking for a value between 1 and 6, with no decimal point, because that range includes the legal values of standard dice. You’ll need to go through a few steps to get such a value. The first thing that you’ll need to do is get a number in the zero-to-five range.  You’ll see why I chose this range in just a moment.   The following line performs the trick:  rollBigger = rollRaw * 6;  This command multiplies the value in rollRaw by 6. This results in a value larger than 0 and less than 6, but still with a huge number of decimal values. To prove this, run the program a few times and take a careful look at the relationship between rollRaw and rollBigger. Although you’re getting closer to your goal, the decimal values are still a problem.   27  C h a p t e r 2  T h e   F o r t u n e   T e l l e r :          R a n d o m N u m b e r s a n d   t h e   i f   S t a t e m e n t  Converting to an Integer You  might  remember  from  grade  school  math  that  positive  and  negative  numbers without decimal values are commonly referred to as integers. Numbers with decimal values are frequently called real numbers. Specifically, computers use a form of real numbers called floating point notation.  Deep in the hardware of the computer, integers and floating point numbers are stored and manipulated in completely different ways. Although you might not care much about the difference, it’s quite important to the computer. Most languages give you ways to translate numbers between the different types of variables. Going from a floating point number to an integer is reasonably easy. JavaScript actually gives you three different ways to do it. Take a look at this line of code, and you’ll see how I did it in this program:  rollInt = Math.floor rollBigger ;  The Math object has a floor   method, which simply lops off the decimal value. The program takes  rollBigger  a value with decimal points between 0 and 6  and just chops off everything after the decimal point. The program then copies the resulting integer value to the rollInt variable. rollInt is now an integer. Its value will be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.  H I N T  Earlier I mentioned that there are three ways to get an integer. The Math object also supplies the ceil   method and the round   method. You can use either of these alternatives, although they would give you slightly different results. ceil   always rounds up, and round   rounds according to normal conventions. Not every lan- guage supports these functions, but almost every programming language has some form of the floor method  although it might have a very different name, such as parseInt or intValue . If you learn how to generate random numbers with the floor   method, you’ll have a strategy that you can easily transport to other pro- gramming languages.  It’s a good idea to look again at the program running a few times. Examine the rela- tionship between rollBigger and rollInt.  Getting Values Larger Than 0 The rollInt variable gets pretty close to what you’re looking for, but it still has one big problem. Although it generates six different values, they are not in exactly the correct range. A typical die has values from 1 to 6, not 0 to 5. This line takes care of that problem:  rollFinal = rollInt + 1;  This line simply increases the value of rollInt by one. Now, every time the program runs, it generates a number in the range 1 through 6. Try the program a few times and see how it works. It’s also instructive to look at the results of this program and exam- ine the relationships between the variables, so you understand how this code works.   28  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Developing an Algorithm for Random Numbers Getting random numbers in a certain range is a very common problem in game pro- gramming. Here’s a summary of my solution for making random integers between low and high: 1. Get a random floating point value. 2. Multiply the value by high. 3. Convert the value to an integer. 4. Add the value of low.  You will use this technique often when you write games. Even when you write pro- grams in other languages, the same strategy will apply. Such generic strategies are called algorithms. Algorithms are proven strategies for solving specific problems. Once you have a good algorithm, it is generally pretty easy to implement it in code.  Making Decisions with the if Statement So far, all of my programs have been sequential. They have simply been a list of instruc- tions for the computer to carry out. This is a completely legitimate form of program- ming, but in other cases you might want the computer to perform different tasks in different situations. The way that you get computers to make decisions requires much the same process that you use when making decisions yourself, although a computer must rely on a much more formulated process.  When you got up this morning, you probably listened to the radio. Most people like to know what the weather will be like before they get dressed in the morning. They say to themselves something like “If it’s cool out today, I’ll wear a sweater.” Although you probably did not have to concentrate very hard on this thought process, it more than likely did occur at some level.  This is an example of logic in action. It relies on a very important construct, called a condition. A condition is an expression that can be evaluated as true or false. In the weather problem, the condition is “It will be cool today.” That statement will be either true or false. As you can see, in human terms, conditions are a lot like yes no questions. When you are designing algorithms, you will often need to think about your logic so that you can turn it into this kind of yes no question. You can usually turn such ques- tions into conditions easily, then use those conditions in a number of interesting ways.  Creating the Low Temp Program Figures 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6 show a few runs of the Low Temp program. This game gener- ates a random number to indicate the current temperature, then recommends dress appropriate for the weather if the temperature is under a threshold temperature of 65 degrees.   29  C h a p t e r 2  T h e   F o r t u n e   T e l l e r :          R a n d o m N u m b e r s a n d   t h e   i f   S t a t e m e n t  FIGURE 2.4  The Low Temp  program generates a random value for the temperature.  FIGURE 2.5  The program suggests attire  appropriate for the current weather  conditions.  FIGURE 2.6  This run of the  program generates  a random  temperature that is above the threshold of 65 degrees. No “Wear a Sweater” message appears.  The code for this program is as follows:         lowTemp         lowTemp     Andy Harris  var temp = 0;  var perfectTemp = 65;     Demonstrates the basic if statement  temp = Math.floor Math.random   * 100  + 1;  alert  "It's " + temp + " degrees outside. " ;  if  temp < perfectTemp {    alert "Wear a sweater!!" ;   }    end if                            lowTemp    30  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i   Hit Reload to see another temperature   Generating the Temperature The temperature-generation line looks intimidating:  temp = Math.floor Math.random   * 100  + 1;  If you look at the line closely, you will see that it is really just another way of stating the algorithm that you developed in the last section. The parentheses denote the order of operation, just as in math, so the program executes Math.random   first. The pro- gram then multiplies the resulting random value  by 100. The computer then adds 1 to the floor of that value, resulting in a number between 1 and 100. This is a reasonable range for temperatures.  Making Decisions with Conditions Of course, the computer is never as flexible as the human mind. Consider all these statements:       It will be cool.      It is cool.      Today will be cool.      It will be a little brisk today.      Temperatures will be in the low 60s.      Today will be a lot like yesterday.  Your mind is flexible enough that you might correctly interpret all these statements  and many more  as meaning the same thing. Humans are blessed with the ability to understand many different kinds of syntax  the basic structure of the statement  and determine the correct semantics  meaning . Computer languages do not handle subtle- ties well. Most of the time, there are very few ways to say something that the computer will understand. The art of programming is refining the expressive language of hu- mans to a more restrictive computer language such as JavaScript without losing too much of the meaning.   31  C h a p t e r 2  T h e   F o r t u n e   T e l l e r :          R a n d o m N u m b e r s a n d   t h e   i f   S t a t e m e n t  TABLE 2.2 COMPARISON OPERATORS IN JAVASCRIPT  Operator < > == != <= >=  Meaning Less than Greater than Is equal to Is not equal to Less than or equal to Greater than or equal to  To express this kind of condition in JavaScript, you need a condition construct. Usually, a condition compares some variable to a value or another variable. For example, the weather statement might be as follows:  temperature < 65  Take a careful look at how this works: Temperature is a variable. The programmer has presumably already created it and given it a starting value. You can use any type of variable in a condition  usually  but you must be careful not to compare different types of values.  More on that later.  The less-than sign  <  is a comparison operator. Table 2.2 lists JavaScript’s comparison operators.  Using the if Statement Once you understand conditions, the if statement is simple to understand. Look again at this code from the Low Temp program:  if  temp < perfectTemp {    alert "Wear a sweater!!" ;  }    end if  The if statement contains a condition in parenthe- ses, and then a left bracket  { . This line tells the computer to analyze the condition. Any condition will evaluate to either true or false. The computer will execute the code between the left brace  {  and the right brace  } only if the condition evaluates to true. In this case, only one line of code is between the braces, but you can put as much code as you wish there.  IN THE REAL WORLD  The if statement is an example of a logic structure. Logic struc- tures are the programming ele- ments  that  allow  you  to  write flexible  programs.  Most  of  the logic  structures  you  will  learn are based on conditions, so it is vital  that  you  understand  how conditions work. This is true in any kind of programming.  The if statement is incredibly powerful, because it allows you to write code that will execute only in certain circumstances, as long as you can write a condition to describe those circumstances. In this program, the message “Wear a sweater” should pop up only when the value of the temp variable is less than   32  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  the value of the perfectTemp variable. If temp is greater than or equal to perfectTemp, nothing at all happens, and the next line of code after the right brace  }  executes. In this program, the brace is on the last line, so program execution simply stops.  Indenting Lines and Using the Semicolon You might have noticed some things about the structure of the if statement. First, the alert line is indented from the margin. JavaScript is not very picky about spaces, in- dentation, or carriage returns, but clever programmers have learned to adopt some conventions that improve the readability of their code. You should indent any code inside a pair of braces. I indent two spaces, but it doesn’t matter that much as long as you are consistent. The right brace aligns vertically under the beginning of the line containing the left brace. This helps me see the beginning and end of the structure plainly. In this case, I am indenting an if statement, but you will see other structures that  require  indentation.  You  will  be  learning  some  other  kinds  of  structure  state- ments soon, and you can nest them inside each other. It can be really tricky to know exactly where you are, so indenting is a great idea. As you look at other books or source code, you will run across many other conventions. Programmers often develop their own personal styles, but this style of indentation is reasonably common.  You might have also noticed that the brace lines do not have semicolons at the end. Semicolons are not needed on any lines that end with a left or right brace.  Using the else Structure The if statement is used to deal with logic that should execute only when a condition is true. Sometimes you will want one set of statements to execute when a condition is true, and another set of statements to execute if the condition is false. For example, you might wish to wear a sweater or a bathing suit. If the weather is cold, you’ll wear the sweater. If it is not cold, you’ll want the bathing suit. The following section de- scribes a program that simulates exactly that situation.  Creating the High or Low Program Figures 2.7 and 2.8 show the High or Low program’s output. Once again, the program generates a temperature randomly, then presents a message related to the tempera- ture. This time, however, that message varies depending on the temperature.  FIGURE 2.7  If the temperature is high, the program  presents the  message “It’s hot!!”   33  C h a p t e r 2  T h e   F o r t u n e   T e l l e r :          R a n d o m N u m b e r s a n d   t h e   i f   S t a t e m e n t  The High or Low program starts out much like the last program, but it has one new feature. See whether you can spot this feature in the code:  FIGURE 2.8  If the temperature is  low, the program  presents the  message “It’s cold!!”   highOrLow               highOrLow     Andy Harris  var temp = 0;  var perfectTemp = 77;     Demonstrates the if   else structure  temp = Math.floor Math.random   * 100  + 1;  alert  "It's " + temp + " degrees outside. " ;  if  temp < perfectTemp {    alert "It's cold!!" ;  } else {    alert "It's hot!!" ;  }    end if                highOrLow           34  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i   Hit Reload to see another temperature         Using the else Clause The only thing that is new in the High or Low program’s code is the else clause. Take a look at the segment around the if statement:  if  temp < perfectTemp {    alert "Wear a Sweater!!" ;  } else {  }    end if    alert "Wear a Bathing Suit!!" ;  The if clause works exactly the same as in the previous program, but now there is an else clause. The part between else { and the closing brace  }  will run only if the condi- tion evaluates to false. If the computer evaluates the condition to true, the Sweater mes- sage pops up and the next line of code after the else clause runs. If the condition turns out to be false, the computer runs only the  else clause. The  else clause can contain several lines of code. It is customary to indent the if-else structure as I did in this ex- ample. This helps you to see at a glance how the programmer organized the code.  Using Nested if Structures It’s common to have more complex types of conditions. For example, what if you want the program to recommend more than two options for clothing for different condi- tions? You might want to wear a jacket if it’s cold, a sweater if it’s cool, short sleeves if it’s warm, and a bathing suit if it’s hot. You can nest if statements inside each other to handle such situations.  Creating the Many Temps Program Figures 2.9 through 2.12 show the Many Temps program, which displays four different messages to the user depending on the temperature range that the program selects randomly.  FIGURE 2.9  This run of the Many  Temps program generated the bathing suit message.   35  C h a p t e r 2  T h e   F o r t u n e   T e l l e r :          R a n d o m N u m b e r s a n d   t h e   i f   S t a t e m e n t  FIGURE 2.10  This time the Many  Temps program  generated the short sleeves message.  FIGURE 2.11  Here the  temperature is cool,  so the program recommends a  sweater.  FIGURE 2.12  Now the  temperature is cold,  so the program suggests a jacket.  As you can see, this version of the program is capable of presenting a different mes- sage for four different temperature ranges. Look at the code to see how the program accomplishes this:   manyTemps               manyTemps     Andy Harris   36  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i     Demonstrates the if else structure  var temp = 0;  temp = Math.floor Math.random   * 100  + 1;  alert  "It's " + temp + " degrees outside. " ;  if  temp < 70 {    if  temp < 30 {      alert "Wear a jacket!!" ;    } else {      alert "Wear a sweater!!" ;      alert "Wear a bathing suit!!" ;      alert "Wear short sleeves" ;    }   end 30 if  } else {    if  temp > 85 {    } else {  }    end 85 if  }    end 70 if                manyTemps                 Hit Reload to see another temperature   The code begins like most of the earlier programs. An if statement checks for a warm temperature  that for this case is defined as 70 degrees . However, this program in- cludes two other if statements, which enable it to identify four distinct temperatures ranges and provide a different message for each range.  Nesting Layers of if Statements The first if statement checks whether the temperature is less than 70 degrees:  Any code between this line and the corresponding right brace  }  will occur only when temp is less than 70. Notice what follows this line:  if  temp < 70 {    if  temp < 30 {   37  C h a p t e r 2  T h e   F o r t u n e   T e l l e r :          R a n d o m N u m b e r s a n d   t h e   i f   S t a t e m e n t  This second if statement is nested inside the first one. It now checks for temperatures above 30 degrees. Any code placed between this line and its right brace will execute only when the temperature is less than 30 degrees.  Of course, because of the first if statement, the program has already determined that the temperature is less than 70 degrees.  The code that executes under these conditions is as follows:      alert "Wear a jacket!!" ;  The jacket message appears only when the temperature is below 30 degrees. The next line is an else statement:    } else {      alert "Wear a sweater!!" ;  The program displays the sweater message only when the temperature is over 30 de- grees, because the command to display the message is in the  else clause of the  if  temp < 30  statement.  To recap, then, the program prints this message only when the temperature is less than 70 degrees  because it’s inside the first if statement  and greater than 30 degrees  because it’s inside the  else clause of the second  if statement . For example, if the computer  generated  a  temperature  of  47  degrees,  the  program  would  evaluate  the  temp < 70  condition as true. Then the computer would check the condition  temp < 30 . This would be false, so the program would defer to the else clause of the  temp < 30  statement and print the message “Wear a sweater!!”  The following line simply ends the inner if structure:    }   end 30 if  You can see how useful indentation and commenting are in such nested statements. Without them, each right brace looks pretty much like another. It’s very hard to tell what structure you are ending unless you use indentation and comments.  The next else clause relates to the very first if statement:  } else {  The fact that this clause is indented directly under the first if statement indicates the clause belongs within the statement. Any code after this else line and the correspond- ing right brace will execute only when the  temp < 70  condition is false.  This particular else clause contains its own if statement, to check where the tempera- ture falls within the 70 to 100 degree range:    if  temp > 85 {      alert "Wear a bathing suit!!" ;    } else {      alert "Wear short sleeves!!" ;    }    end 85 if  Finally, the program closes the outermost if statement with this line:  }    end 70 if  It is lined up vertically with the if  temp < 70  statement and the corresponding } else { line to help clarify which structure it is ending. I also commented the line to clarify even further what is going on.   T R I C K  If you’re still confused about how these nested statements work, run the program while you’re looking at the code. When the computer first outputs the number, see whether you can figure out which line of code will execute next. This technique is very useful, because it helps you find difficult bugs in your programs.  Using the switch Structure JavaScript  supplies  one  more  structure  that  can  be  very  useful  when  you  have  one variable that might have a lot of different values. To illustrate, I wrote a program that adds a very crude graphical interface to the Die Roller program from earlier in this chapter:  Creating the Fuzzy Dice Program Figure 2.13 shows a fancier die-rolling program. Appropriately enough, I call it the Fuzzy Dice program. You’ll get to make even better graphics later, but this program demonstrates how you can at least generate crude images.  As  you  can  see,  the  program  generates  a  random  number,  then  draws  a  text-based image of the die on the alert box.  Here’s  the  code  that  does  the  work.  Although  it  looks  kind  of  long,  it’s  really  very repetitive, so don’t let the length of the listing intimidate you.  38  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 2.13  Several rolls of the Fuzzy Dice program.   39  C h a p t e r 2  T h e   F o r t u n e   T e l l e r :          R a n d o m N u m b e r s a n d   t h e   i f   S t a t e m e n t   fuzzyDice               fuzzyDice     Andy Harris  var roll = 0;  var die = "";     Demonstrates switch statement  roll = Math.floor Math.random   * 6  + 1;  switch  roll {    case 1:      die = "--------\n";      die +="         \n";      die +="    *    \n";      die +="         \n";      die +="--------\n";      break;    case 2:      die = "--------\n";      die +="       * \n";      die +="         \n";      die +=" *       \n";      die +="--------\n";      break;    case 3:      die = "--------\n";      die +="       * \n";      die +="    *    \n";      die +=" *       \n";      die +="--------\n";      break;    case 4:      die = "--------\n";      die +=" *     * \n";      die +="         \n";      die +=" *     * \n";      die +="--------\n";      break;    case 5:      die = "--------\n";      die +=" *     * \n";      die +="    *    \n";      die +=" *     * \n";   40  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i      die +="--------\n";      break;    case 6:      die = "--------\n";      die +=" *     * \n";      die +=" *     * \n";      die +=" *     * \n";      die +="--------\n";      break;    default:      die = "ERROR!"  }    end switch  alert die ;                fuzzyDice     reload to see another die   The code begins in a now-familiar way:              var roll = 0;  var die = "";  roll = Math.floor Math.random   * 6  + 1;  These first few lines set up a variable for the numeric die roll, and roll the die using the technique that you learned earlier in this chapter.  Generating a zero-to-one num- ber, multiplying it by six, and adding one . The die variable contains characters that together create a crude image representing the side of the die that the program rolled.  Using the switch Statement The new stuff begins with the switch statement:  switch  roll {  This statement accepts the name of a variable. It tells the computer to start thinking about the value of roll. It ends with a right brace, signifying the beginning of a logical structure. As usual, the code between the braces is indented. The rest of the structure will look at various possible values for the variable:    case 1:   41  C h a p t e r 2  T h e   F o r t u n e   T e l l e r :          R a n d o m N u m b e r s a n d   t h e   i f   S t a t e m e n t  This line checks whether roll’s value is equal to   1. The code between this line and the next case statement will execute if roll is equal to 1.  The actual code is simply a bunch of assignment statements that add to the die string variable:      die = "--------\n";  This line assigns a value for the top of the die. The  \n part is a special placeholder called newline. This placeholder represents pressing the carriage return. I include this newline so that the die image takes up more than one line on the alert dialog box.  The other lines are all pretty similar:      die +="         \n";      die +="    *    \n";      die +="         \n";      die +="--------\n";  die +="         \n";  is exactly the same as  die = die + "         \n";  The only significant difference between these lines and the first line in the case state- ment is the += operator. This operator is simply a shortcut for concatenation.  Using the break Statement At the end of each case statement, you will see a line such as the following:  The break statement tells the computer to move on to the end of the switch structure.      break;  T R A P  Don’t forget to put a break statement at the end of each case block. If you don’t put a break statement there, the computer will also evaluate the next case block. This is a very common mistake, especially for people who have programmed using lan- guages based on BASIC, which does not require anything like the break command.  Using the default Clause You can add a default clause to a switch structure. The computer executes a default clause only when none of the other conditions are true. I added a default clause to this  switch  structure,  although  the  computer  should  never  execute  the  clause.  If  I designed my algorithm correctly, the value will never be anything other than an inte- ger between 1 and 6. Still, I often include a default clause even when I do not expect the program to need it. Then, the program will be ready for the unexpected.  You’ve learned a lot of new syntax in this chapter.

It turns out to be incredibly simple after everything you’ve learned. In fact, it’s just like the Die Roller program, except I’ve used messages instead of images. Here’s the code:         43  C h a p t e r 2  T h e   F o r t u n e   T e l l e r :          R a n d o m N u m b e r s a n d   t h e   i f   S t a t e m e n t   fortune         fortune     Andy Harris     The Fortune-teller  var roll = 0;  var fortune = "";  roll = Math.floor Math.random   * 5  + 1;  switch roll {    case 1:      fortune = "It looks really bad.";      fortune = "It's kinda gloomy.";      fortune = "Whatever.";      fortune = "Things are pretty good.";      fortune = "You're in for a perfect day!";      fortune = "ERROR";  }    end switch  alert fortune ;      break;    case 2:      break;    case 3:      break;    case 4:      break;    case 5:      break;    default:                            fortune     reload for another fortune    44  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Summary In this chapter, you learned how to generate random numbers and refine them so that they fit within a specific range. You also learned how to make the computer’s logic branch. The chapter showed you examples of conditions and explained how programmers use them in if statements. You looked at more advanced variants of the if statement, in- cluding the  else clause, nested if statements, and the switch structure. In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to use conditions to make the computer repeat certain actions.  E X E R C I S E S  1.

C H A P T E R  3  The Number  Guesser: for and  while Loops You are starting to learn all the important  tasks involved in programming. So far, you have learned how to store informa- tion in variables, send messages to the user, retrieve information from the user, and make your program branch. Now you’ll add another critical element, which is the ability to make your program repeat itself.  Specifically, you will learn how to do the following:    Use for loops to repeat a given number of times    Modify for loops to skip values    Make for loops go backward    Use code tracing to verify your understanding  of the code’s behavior    Create while loops    Prevent endless loops    Plan complex programs with pseudocode   Project: The Number Guesser As usual, you’ll start by looking at an example. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to write this program. It’s a classic guessing game. The computer will think of a number between 1 and 100  see Figure 3.1 . The user will try to guess the computer’s number  see Figure 3.2 . After each guess, the computer tells the user whether the user’s guess is high, low, or correct  see Figures 3.3 and 3.4 . The computer keeps track of the number of turns it takes the user to guess the number.  As  you  can  see,  this  program  repeatedly  asks  the  user  for  a  number  until  the  user guesses correctly. Clearly this program relies on the branching behavior that you learned about in the last chapter. After all, the user gets a different message if he or she guessed high or low. In addition to branching, the program also repeats. It repeats the same set of instructions over and over until the user gets the answer right. This repeating be- havior is called looping.  Counting Forward Most programming languages offer a couple of types of loops. The first kind you’ll exam- ine is useful for those times when you want something to happen a certain number of times. It’s called a for loop, and the following program, the Racer, shows it in action.  46  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 3.1  Here’s the opening  screen of the  Number Guesser.  FIGURE 3.2  This screen enables  the user to input  a number.  FIGURE 3.3  The user’s guess  was too high.  FIGURE 3.4  The user finally  guessed correctly.   47  C h a p t e r 3     T h e N u m b e r   G u e s s e r :   f o r   a n d w h     i l e   L o o p s  Creating the Racer Program The Racer program is a silly simulation of a 10-lap race. All it does is present an alert box that tells the user which lap the driver is on. Figure 3.5 shows the program.  Although you could write this program as a series of alert statements, the program actually has only one  alert statement. I got the program to repeat by putting that alert statement inside a for loop. Here’s how the code looks:              Racer   Racer      Andy Harris     Demonstrates the basic for loop  var lap = 0;  for  lap = 1; lap <= 10; lap++ {    alert "Now on lap: " + lap ;  }    end for loop                            Racer    FIGURE 3.5  A few of the dialog boxes that pop up  as the Racer program runs.  The program has one variable, called lap, and one alert statement. I nested the state- ment inside a set of braces. The for statement causes the alert statement to execute 10 times. The advantage of using a loop rather than a number of alert statements is flexibility. If I want the race to be five or 100 laps, all I have to do is change one state- ment in the code.   48  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Using the for Statement The for statement sets up a loop. It is especially useful when you know exactly how many times you want something to repeat. Take another look at this line from the Racer program:  for  lap = 1; lap <= 10; lap++ {  for loops have three parts inside the parentheses. The first segment initializes a vari- able. The second part is a condition used to determine when the loop ends. The third part tells the computer how to change the variable each time through the loop.  The initialization segment, lap = 1;, specifies the name of a variable that will be used in the loop and the variable’s starting value. To make a  for loop, you must have a numeric variable. In this case, I used the variable lap, which will specify which lap the program is currently on. The semicolon separates this part of the for loop from the next part.  You specify the condition of the for loop code as follows:  lap <= 10;  The code inside the loop will keep on running as long as this condition is true. In this example, the lap variable begins with a value of one, and the code continues execut- ing as long as the value of lap is less than or equal to 10.  The last part of the for line looks like this:  lap++  The ++ operator is shorthand for “add 1.” So, you could also write lap++ as lap = lap + 1. The function of this part of the for loop is to change the value of the variable so the condition will eventually become false. Basically, this is what the line means: “Use the variable lap. Start it out at 1, and keep going as long as it is less than or equal to 10. Each time the loop is completed, add 1 more to the value of lap.”  Tracing Code To help explain what’s going on in this loop, I’ll employ a programmer’s trick called code tracing. This is a good technique to use when you’re trying to figure out how a piece of code works or why it isn’t doing what you want it to do. To trace code, make a table.  You can draw the table on paper, as it doesn’t need to be anything formal.  Write the names of all your variables and conditions along the top of the table, like this:  lap ____ ____ ____  lap <= 10  _________________ _________________ _________________  Now study the code line by line. Each time the value of a variable changes, write the new value in the table. If the program uses that variable in a condition, write down whether that condition is true or false. The first line of code is as follows:  var lap = 0;   After the computer evaluates this line, your table will look like this:  lap 0  ____ ____  lap <= 10  true  _________________ _________________  The value of lap is now 0, and 0 is less than 10, so lap <= 10 is true. Now go on to the next line, and continue with the process:  for  lap = 1; lap <= 10; lap++ {  After this line executes the first time, here’s what your chart will look like:  ____  _________________  The first time through the loop, the program initializes the value of lap to one. The condition evaluates to true, so the program executes the code inside the braces. The alert statement tells the user the lap value. When the computer encounters the right brace signifying the end of the loop, control automatically reverts to the for loop line.  This time through, the computer increases the value of lap by 1, so by the end of the second time through the for line, here’s how your chart will look:  49  C h a p t e r 3     T h e N u m b e r   G u e s s e r :   f o r   a n d w h     i l e   L o o p s  The value of lap is now 2, and the condition is still true, so the loop will continue to execute. Things get interesting when  lap is equal to 10. Look at how the code trace looks up to this point:  lap 0 1  lap 0 1 2  lap 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  lap <= 10  true true  lap <= 10  true true true  lap <= 10  true true true true true true true true true true true   The next time through the for statement, the value of lap becomes 11. This is interest- ing, because the value of the condition will finally change:  lap 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  lap <= 10  true true true true true true true true true true true false  50  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Now the condition lap  <=  10 evaluates to false, so the loop no longer executes, and program control reverts to the next line of code after the right brace  } . As promised, the code executes exactly 10 times, outputting values between 1 and 10.  Skipping Values The form of the for loop in the Racer program demonstrates the most common way to use the for loop structure. You can use the for loop in other ways, however. The Count by Five program shows one of these ways.  Creating the Count By Five Program Figure 3.6 shows the Count by Five program, which is a simple application that in- cludes a loop that counts by five with each pass.  This program uses a variation of exactly the same type of loop as in the Racer program. Take a look at its code to see what is different:   Count By Five               CountByFive  FIGURE 3.6  The Count by Five program counts by five with each pass through the loop.   51  C h a p t e r 3     T h e N u m b e r   G u e s s e r :   f o r   a n d w h     i l e   L o o p s     Andy Harris     demonstrates how to vary the for loop  var i = 0;  for  i=5; i <= 100; i += 5 {    alert  i ;  }    end for loop                Count By Five                This program is very much like the Racer program. The only significant difference is in the for loop line. That line looks like this:  for  i=5; i <= 100; i += 5 {  As you can see, the variable is now named i. I chose this name because in this case I’m not necessarily thinking of laps. When programmers need a counter for a for struc- ture and that counter does not have any particular meaning except as a counter, it’s traditional to name it i.  H I N T  It might seem strange that an endeavor as young as computer programming would have tradition and folklore, but this particular tidbit  using i as a for loop counter  is an example of the richness of computing lore. The reason that programmers use i in this way dates all the way back to FORTRAN, one of the earliest programming languages. In early versions of FORTRAN, integer variables had to start with i, j, k, and a few other letters. Oddly enough, even though FORTRAN has not been a main- stream programming language for several decades, the practice of using  i as a generic name for a counter is still very common.  You might want to determine for yourself what you think the line for   i=5;  i  <= 100; i += 5 { means. i starts at 5 and goes to 100. Each time through the loop, the program increases i by five.  Using the += Operator You have already seen the += operator in action in the context of string concatenation. You can also use this operator with numeric variables. In this context, it means to add five to i. You could also write the code fragment i += 5 as i = i + 5. Most programmers   52  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  prefer the += operator, because it’s faster to type. As you have no doubt deduced, this program works exactly like the Racer program except that the Count by Five program counts from 5 to 100 by five.  Counting Backward You  can  also  design  for  loops  so  that  they  run  from  larger  values  to  smaller  ones. Essentially, all you need to do is to modify the for loop line.  Creating the Back Racer Program Figure 3.7 shows another version of the Racer program, but this one goes backward. It starts at lap 10 and counts down to lap 1.  Making a for Loop Count Backward The code is very similar to earlier programs in this chapter. Here’s the entire program:     demonstrates counting backward through a for loop   Back Racer               Back Racer     Andy Harris  var i = 0;  for  i = 10; i > 0; i-- {    alert i ;  }    end for loop                Back Racer                FIGURE 3.7  This time the loop goes from 10 to 1.   As you might expect, the only differences occur in the for line. This time I initialized the variable to a large value, which the program decreases each time through the loop.  The initialization part of the loop starts the value of i at 10. The condition now checks whether i is greater than 0, and the program decreases the variable by 1 each time through the loop.  T R A P  Some programmers misuse the  for loop. The way that you build  for loops in JavaScript  and the other languages derived from C  allows you to use the struc- ture in all kinds of other ways. However, doing so is a dangerous practice. Use the for loop when you know how many times you want a loop to execute, when you want to have a variable take on every fifth value, or in similar circumstances. If you need any other kind of looping behavior, use the while loop, which the next section describes.  Using the while Loop The for loop is an easy structure to build, and it is terrific at certain kinds of repeti- tion. However, sometimes the for loop does not provide enough flexibility. Take a look at the following program, the Joke Teller, and see whether you can figure out why a for loop would not be a useful structure for controlling the program.  Creating the Joke Teller Program Figures 3.8 and 3.9 show the Joke Teller program, which asks the user a very old riddle, then asks the user for an answer.  This program needs to keep repeating, but the number of repetitions depends entirely on the user’s actions. The part of the program that poses the riddle is inside the loop. That code might execute only once, or it may execute many times. In fact, if the user never enters the correct answer, the loop will continue forever.  53  C h a p t e r 3     T h e N u m b e r   G u e s s e r :   f o r   a n d w h     i l e   L o o p s  FIGURE 3.8  The Joke Teller program asks the user a riddle, then prints a response if the user guesses  incorrectly.   54  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 3.9  The program keeps asking the user for the correct answer  until he or she gets it right.  FIGURE 3.10  When the user  enters the  correct answer, the loop ends.  Looping an Indeterminate Number of Times Look at the code behind the Joke Teller program. It uses a loop, but not a for loop.   Joke Teller               Joke Teller     Andy Harris     Demonstrates the while loop  var correct = "to get to the other side";  var guess = "";  while  guess != correct {    guess = prompt  "Why did the chicken cross the road?", "" ;    if  guess == correct {      alert  "Pretty funny, huh?" ;    } else {      alert  "that's not it..." ;   55  C h a p t e r 3     T h e N u m b e r   G u e s s e r :   f o r   a n d w h     i l e   L o o p s          Joke Teller      }    end if  }    end while                    T R I C K  The program starts with two variables. One is intended to hold the correct answer. That variable is called correct. The other variable is called guess.  These choices for variable names are very deliberate. By looking at the variable names, it is clear which one contains the intended correct answer, and which one contains the user’s guess. Novice programmers might be tempted to call one of the variables answer. The problem with that name is that it does not make it clear whether the variable contains the correct answer or the user’s answer. It’s surpris- ing how easily you can get confused about what your variables are supposed to contain. Try hard to come up with names that are unambiguous whenever possible.  Using the while Statement A while structure contains the main body of this program. That structure begins with this line:  while  guess != correct {  The structure ends with a corresponding right brace:  }    end while  IN THE REAL WORLD  Even if the user knows the correct answer to this riddle, it is very possible that he or she would type it incorrectly and not get credit for knowing the answer. If this were a serious program  one that was meant to do more than demonstrate the while loop , I would have added code to check the capitalization, perhaps look at alternate punctuation, and check for multiple spaces. Better  yet,  I  might  have  designed  the  program  so  that  the  user  didn’t  have  to  type  in  the answer at all but could choose it from some sort of menu. Still, the program is really designed to show how while loops work. In later chapters, you’ll learn some techniques for getting input from the user that do not require as much error checking.   56  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  The code between these lines is the part meant to be repeated. The syntax of the while statement is much simpler than that of the for loop. It simply consists of a condition. In this particular case, the loop should continue to execute as long as  guess is not equal to correct. while loops always have a condition, and the code in the loop contin- ues to execute as long as the condition evaluates to true. As soon as the condition evaluates to false, the next line of code after the end of the loop executes.  Recognizing Loops That Never Execute while loops are very simple to build, but they can be dangerous. The design of the for loop makes it reasonably safe, because the user is required to put certain elements in it. The structure of the while loop is less rigid, which means some bad things could happen. See whether you can guess what would happen if a program contained this code:  var i = 10;  while  i < 10 {    alert i ;    i++;  }    end while  var i = 0;  while  i < 10 {    alert  i ;  }    end while  i 0 0 0  i < 10 true true true  The variable i is initialized to 10. The condition then checks whether i is less than 10. The condition is false, so the computer never executes the code inside the loop. This program will end as soon as it is run, and you’ll never see any results. When designing a loop, you have to be careful that your condition can execute at least one time.  Recognizing Endless Loops Here’s another problem that’s harder to spot:  This time the code initializes the variable properly, and the condition in the  while loop is fine, but there’s a worse problem. There’s no code to increment the variable, so its value will always be 0. Here’s a partial code trace of the program:  The value of i will never become larger than 0, so the condition will remain true for- ever. The code will never stop spinning through the loop. This is an example of an endless  or infinite  loop. It’s reasonably easy to make such a loop accidentally when you’re learning to program  or even when you’re a professional! . The only way to stop an endless loop is to shut down the program. Press Ctrl, Alt, Delete to go to the task manager in Windows 95 98 00 NT and shut down your browser. Go back and edit your program before you try it again.   Making Well-Behaved Loops Experienced programmers have learned a few tricks that prevent many of the looping problems noted in this chapter:    Design your condition carefully. Think carefully about the variables that you will use in your condition, and make sure that they are spelled correctly, with correct capitalization. Make sure that your condition tests what you think it tests.    Be sure to initialize variables. Any variables used in your condition should be ini-  tialized outside the loop, so you can predict what will happen the first time through the loop. If you have a loop that seems as though it never executes at all, check whether the variables have the values that you think they should before the loop starts.  In fact, you may want to include temporarily an alert statement in- forming you what the values of the appropriate variables are.     Ensure that the condition can be triggered. The loop must contain some code that changes the value of a variable in the condition so that the condition can become false and the code can exit. This problem is usually the cause of an endless loop.  Returning to the Number Guesser The number-guessing game that made its debut at the beginning of this chapter is a nice program, because it ties together many concepts used in the first few chapters and incorporates a looping structure. Rather than simply showing you the code, this section will show you how I planned the program. The planning phase is often the most difficult part of programming.  Planning the Program The first thing I did was think through what the program should do. Then I wrote down a sample transcript of the “conversation” between the user and the computer. That transcript looked a little like this:  57  C h a p t e r 3     T h e N u m b e r   G u e s s e r :   f o r   a n d w h     i l e   L o o p s  Computer I’m thinking of a number. Too high. Too low. That’s it! It took three tries.  User 50 25 30 X  Although this is clearly a simplistic form of the program, it illustrates the basic elements that I need to think about as I build the program. The user needs to be able to input some values, and the computer must evaluate the input. Specifically, the computer must compare the input to some randomly generated number. The code  should  be  capable  of  executing  an  unspecified  number  of  times   until  the user gets the right answer , and the computer must keep track of how many times the user went through the loop.  T R I C K  It’s a great idea to write down this summary of your program. It will be much easier to put together all the parts of your program if you know what they are.   58  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Writing Pseudocode The process described in the preceding section might not give you enough informa- tion to get started programming. Many programmers like to write a form of their plan in a language called pseudocode. Pseudocode expresses the main ideas of the program, but is easier to work with because it does not require you to follow all the strict laws of programming language syntax. Here’s my pseudocode representation of the Number Guesser program:  make variables    guess = user's guess    target = random number generated by computer    turns = how many turns it takes user to guess  get a random number between 1 and 100  explain game to user  ask user for a guess  as long as user has not guessed right answer,    increment turn counter    if user's guess is too high,      say so      get another guess    if user's guess is too low,      say so      get another guess    if user's guess is correct,      tell user he or she won      tell how many turns it took  You write your pseudocode in English, with each line conveying a specific thought. If you can look at each line of pseudocode and figure out how to translate that line into JavaScript, your pseudocode is detailed enough. If the pseudocode appears to solve the problem at hand, it’s probably complete enough.  T R A P  The number one problem of beginning programmers is the tendency to write code too early. If you ever find yourself staring at the computer wondering what you should type  next,  turn  the  monitor  off  and  get  out  some  paper.  When  you  have  solid pseudocode, you’ll write better programs.  It is not a major step to go from the pseudocode to a working program. Here’s my version:         NumberGuesser         NumberGuesser   59  C h a p t e r 3     T h e N u m b e r   G u e s s e r :   f o r   a n d w h     i l e   L o o p s     The classic number guessing game     Andy Harris  var guess = 50;  var target = 0;  var turns = 0;  var msg = "";  target = Math.floor Math.random   * 100  + 1;    alert target ;  msg = "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100. \n";  msg += "Guess my number, and I'll tell you if it's too high, \n";  msg += "too low, or correct.  Try to guess in the fewest turns.";  alert  msg ;  guess = eval prompt "What is your guess?", guess  ;      guess = eval prompt  turns + ".  Too high!! Next guess?", guess  ;      guess = prompt  turns + ".  Too low!! Next guess?", guess ;  while  guess != target {    turns++;    if  guess > target {    }    end if    if  guess < target {    }    end if    if  guess == target {      msg = "YOU WIN!!! \n";      msg += "It took you ";      msg += turns + " turns! ";      alert  msg ;    }    end if  }    end while        Generating the Target Once I knew that I needed to generate a number between 1 and 100, I remembered the algorithm from Chapter 1, “Variables, Input, and Output.” Writing the code turned out to be pretty easy once I knew what I wanted to do.   60  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  T R I C K  Notice this line in the code:    alert  target ;  It is a very useful debugging tool. When I first wrote the target generation code, I wanted to be sure that it was generating the kinds of values I was looking for. The alert statement shows the value of target, so it helped to reassure me that the target code was working. Also, when the entire program was working, it was nice to know the value of  target right away, so I could test the program more quickly without having to guess the variable’s value every time through the loop. Because this line is so useful, I decided not to destroy it completely after testing my program. Instead, I simply put the comment characters      in front of the line. This way, if I need the line again, it will be easy to bring back. Whenever you are unsure about the status of a variable, use an alert statement like this to make sure that it has the value that you think it does. Of course, don’t forget to comment out the line before posting the code to your Web site.  Setting Up the Loop The pseudocode says, “as long as user has not guessed right answer.” The trick of turn- ing this into actual working code is to figure out how to translate that line of English into a condition with which the computer can work. My solution was this:  while  guess != target {  The condition uses two variables, so I was careful to ensure that both were initialized before the loop began. The computer generated a value for target, so it is initialized. I ensured that guess had a legal initial value by asking for a guess before the loop began.  Getting User Input The user input is pretty straightforward. Notice that I immediately evaluated the re- sponse  from  the  user   with  the  eval  statement   so  I  wouldn’t  have  to  worry  about nonnumeric values. Notice also that the user input occurs multiple times. I first ask for a value from the user outside the loop  to initialize  guess , and then I ask for a value inside the loop. The prompt informs the user whether the current guess is high or low and asks for another guess. This is necessary, because the value of guess must change before the loop can end.  The prompt also includes the current value of guess as the default value, so the user can see what his or her last guess was. This also pro- vides a subtle clue to the user that numeric input is expected.  Evaluating the Input When the user inputs a guess, the program evaluates that guess to turn it into a nu- meric value. Then I use a series of if statements to compare guess to correct. If the value is too high or too low, the next prompt informs the user of this situation and asks for another input. If the value is correct, an appropriate message goes to the user, including  the  number  of  turns  it  took  to  get  the  correct  answer.  Note  that  I  use  a   61  C h a p t e r 3     T h e N u m b e r   G u e s s e r :   f o r   a n d w h     i l e   L o o p s  special variable  msg  whenever my output strings involve complicated concatenations. I find that using a variable in such situations decreases the likelihood of syntax errors. As an example of this phenomenon, look carefully at the following line of code:  var msg = num1 + " + " + num2 + " = " eval num1 + num2   It might not be obvious what the line does, and it will be very easy to make a mistake with the quote signs and plus signs. Compare that line to the following series of state- ments:  var msg;  msg = num1;  msg += " + ";  msg += num2;  msg += " = ";  msg += eval num1 + num2 ;  The second code fragment is longer, but it much more clearly describes what is going on  the program is concatenating a variable which shows the addition of two other variables .  If you get a syntax error in the first version, you won’t have much more information to go on.  If you have a syntax error in the second version of the code, you’ll know exactly which part of that complex structure is giving you trouble.  Table 3.1 provides a summary of the new syntax covered in this chapter.

You learned how to use the for loop to handle situations involving a speci- fied number of repetitions. You also learned variations of the basic for loop, including loops that increment by an arbitrary value and loops that count backward.  This chapter also introduced the powerful while loop. You learned how to write pro- grams using the structure, and you learned how to avoid some of the common pitfalls of its use. Finally, you looked at how to use pseudocode to help you write complex programs.  In the next chapter, you will learn how to access the objects inherent in the JavaScript model and learn new ways to get information to and from the user.  E X E R C I S E S  1. Write a program that asks the user for the answer to 2 + 3  or some other math problem . Your program should keep asking the question until the user enters the correct answer.  2. Change the preceding program so that it generates the numbers to add randomly.  3. Modify this program so it gives a total of five random math problems, but repeats each one until the user gets the right answer. Only move on to the next question when the user gets a question correct.  You’ll need a for loop and a while loop for this one.   4. Improve the Number Guesser so that it asks the user whether he or she wants to play  again. Repeat the entire game until the user indicates that he or she is done.  5. Write a version of the Number Guesser with the roles reversed. This time, the user comes up with the random value, and the computer guesses what the number is. Have the user respond  with  “h”   for  high ,  “l”   for  low ,  or  “c”   for  correct .  You’ll  need  to  write pseudocode for this program. The logic is totally different than for this chapter’s Number Guesser program.   The Basic Mad Lib  C H A P T E R  4  Program and Object-Based Programming The programming principles discussed in  the last few chapters have not changed much since the advent of the early pro- gramming languages.  JavaScript  also  supports some modern ideas that have revolutionized com- puter  applications  and  computer  programming. Next, you will begin to explore the world of object- based programming. Here are some of the things you will learn in this chapter:    The basic characteristics of objects    How properties, methods, and events work    How to use some properties of the document object    How to use some methods of the document object    How to use events    How to write functions to encapsulate your code    How to handle input and output the modern way   The Project: Mad Lib The  main  project  for  this  chapter  will  be  a  lot  of  fun.  When  the  Mad  Lib  program starts, the Web page contains a form with a number of screen elements  see Figure 4.1 .  The Web page consists of an HTML form with a series of text boxes, a command button, and a large text area. This program does not use dialog boxes at all. Instead, the pro- gram integrates all of the input and output directly into the Web page itself  see Fig- ures 4.2 and 4.3 .  64  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 4.1  In the Mad Lib  program, the HTML page itself plays a  critical role.  FIGURE 4.2  The user has typed some values into  a form.   65  C h a p t e r 4              T h e B a s i c M a d   L i b P r o g r a m a n d O b j e c t - B a s e d P r o g r a m m n g  i        FIGURE 4.3  After the user  presses the Click for  Story button, the text box displays a  silly story.  The results of this program can be very funny. Of course, the program is even more fun when you make up your own story and have the user enter more words.  From a programming standpoint, this game brings a lot of new elements to the table. Before now, your programs have had very little relationship to any other HTML you may have had on your pages. This game tightly integrates HTML and JavaScript.  Objects and HTML To get your JavaScript programs to interact with the pages in which you place them, you need to understand how JavaScript sees Web pages. This concept might seem a little strange at first, but it is a very important idea, and you’ll have a lot of power when you understand it.  The Color Flasher Program Figures  4.4  and  4.5  show  the  Color  Flasher  program,  which  demonstrates  how  a JavaScript program can interact with the Web page in which it resides.  The program steps through a number of colors, dynamically changing the Web page’s background color. This effect would not be possible with ordinary HTML. Here is the code for this program:   Color Flasher               Color Flasher     Andy Harris   66  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i     Demonstrates use of the bgColor method  document.bgColor = "red";  alert "ready for another color?" ;  document.bgColor = "orange";  alert "ready for another color?" ;  document.bgColor = "yellow";  alert "ready for another color?" ;  document.bgColor = "green";  alert "ready for another color?" ;  document.bgColor = "blue";  alert "ready for another color?" ;  document.bgColor = "indigo";  alert "ready for another color?" ;  document.bgColor = "violet";  alert "ready for another color?" ;  document.bgColor = "black";  alert "ready for another color?" ;  document.bgColor = "white";          Color Flasher                      The Color Flasher code is very repetitive. The only new concept is demonstrated in a bunch of lines that look like this:  document.bgColor = "violet";  As  you  can  tell,  the  program  copies  the  value  v i o l e t  to  something  called document.bgColor, which is a special variable-like entity that is used to refer to the background color of the document.   67  C h a p t e r 4              T h e B a s i c M a d   L i b P r o g r a m a n d O b j e c t - B a s e d P r o g r a m m n g  i        FIGURE 4.4  Although this black  and white  screenshot doesn’t indicate the color,  the program is  displaying the Web  page with a red background.  FIGURE 4.5  After the user clicks  the OK button, the background  changes to another color.  The Characteristics of Objects JavaScript uses object-based programming, a scheme whereby certain elements  such as the parts of a Web page, for example  are defined as objects. In the real world, you use objects all the time. Any kind of object—whether it is a Web page, a stapler, or an elephant—has certain defining elements. Programmers call these features of an object properties, methods, and events. To explain these concepts, I’ll start by talking about the kinds of objects you know in the real world  cows and staplers, to be specific . Then I’ll explain how JavaScript uses objects to manage the Web page.   68  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Properties A  property  of  an  object  is  some  particular  characteristic  of  an  object.  A  cow  object might have properties such as name, breed, age, weight, and owner. A stapler object could  have  properties  such  as  c o l o r,  m a n u f a c t u r e r,  n u m b e r O f S t a p l e s,  and stapleCapacity. Properties are like adjectives in human languages. They contain data, like variables do. Some properties contain text, and some contain numbers or boolean  true false  values. Properties give the object the capacity to hold information.  Methods If a property is an adjective, a method is like a verb. A method is something that the object can do. You’ve already seen some examples of methods in this book. You might recall the toUpperCase   method of the String object, or Math.random  , which is a reference to the random   method of the Math object. The cow object’s methods might include eat, moo, and giveMilk. A stapler object might have methods like fasten  to staple pages together  and openFlat  to staple things to the wall . Methods give objects the ability to do things.  Events The closest counterparts to events in the English language are messages such as “Hous- ton, we have a problem. An event is a message that the object can send to other objects. It is also like a stimulus or prompt. An object’s events are automatically triggered when something occurs. The cow object could have hungry, tipping, or givingBirth events, for example. If somebody is tipping the cow over, the tipping event would occur.  Pre- sumably some other object  such as a sheriff or farmer object, perhaps  will respond to the tipping event and chase away all the sophomore objects. The stapler might have a jammed event, which would occur whenever the stapler gets all gummed up. It also might have a pressed event that occurs whenever somebody tries to press down on the stapler. Events enable an object to indicate its state to other objects.  T R I C K  If you’re confused about the distinction between methods and events, here’s another way to think about it: Events are things the object can do, and methods are things that happen to an object. If you’re still confused, read on. The rest of the chapter looks at some examples in JavaScript, and the programming examples should help you make plenty of sense of properties, methods, and events as they are used in JavaScript.  Reading the Properties of an Object You actually used some properties already in the Color Flasher program. You repeat- edly changed the .bgcolor property of the document object. Document Info is another program that draws a little more deeply from the mysterious document object and a few of its key properties.   IN THE REAL WORLD  The practice of using objects in programming has become a very important part of the modern computing world. JavaScript is an example of an object-based programming language. This means that JavaScript has support for objects, but the implementation of these objects falls short of some technical criteria. Visual Basic and Perl are also examples of object-based lan- guages. Languages such as C++ and Java follow more exacting rules in the ways that objects are created and can be used. Computer scientists generally only refer to those languages that meet these more stringent standards as truly object-oriented languages.  Regardless, the ability to describe entities as objects has revolutionized programming. Using objects makes it easier for code to be written by teams of programmers, and it makes pro- grams easier to repair than the older types of programming schemes. If you are interested in learning more about object-oriented programming, it is a great idea to get some practice in an object-based language such as JavaScript first.  The Document Info Program The Document Info program pops up a number of dialog boxes that give information about the page containing the JavaScript code  see Figure 4.6 .  JavaScript has an object called document. This object refers to the HTML page in which the JavaScript code resides.  The  document object, like most objects, has properties,  69  C h a p t e r 4              T h e B a s i c M a d   L i b P r o g r a m a n d O b j e c t - B a s e d P r o g r a m m n g  i        FIGURE 4.6  The Document Info program’s dialog boxes describe  characteristics of a document that are  stored in the  document  object’s properties.   70  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  events,  and  methods.  Here’s  the  code  that  demonstrates  some  properties  of  the document object:            Document Info        Document Info       Andy Harris       Demonstrate some properties of the document object    alert "background: " + document.bgColor ;    alert "domain: " + document.domain ;    alert "last changed: " + document.lastModified ;    alert "URL: " + document.location ;    alert "Last page: " + document.referrer ;    alert "Title: " + document.title ;                           Document Info    The code consists of a series of alert statements. These statements all include refer- ences to the document object.  Document Properties The  document object is very important in JavaScript programming. It represents the Web page containing the JavaScript code. The properties of the object reveal impor- tant information about the Web page. Table 4.1 details a partial list of the properties of the document object.  In addition to these properties, if a Web page contains forms and form elements, they are also available as properties. You will see this soon.  A document property is very much like a variable, except that you do not have to define it yourself. The property is built into the browser. Some properties, such as the bgColor property, can be written to and read from. You can print out the value of document.bgColor, or you can assign a value to it to change the document’s background color.   71  C h a p t e r 4              T h e B a s i c M a d   L i b P r o g r a m a n d O b j e c t - B a s e d P r o g r a m m n g  i        TABLE 4.1 DOCUMENT OBJECT PROPERTIES  taglastModified  Property  bgColor  title  url  domain  referrer  Description The background color assigned to the page’s body. The date that the document was last changed. The title of the document. The address of the document. The domain name of the document’s host. If the user got to this page via a hyperlink, this property shows the address of the page that referred to the current one.  Platform Issues Whereas JavaScript itself is a reasonably standard environment, browser manufactur- ers have been horribly inconsistent in how they define document objects. Netscape Navi- gator and Microsoft Internet Explorer both have  document objects, but these objects are not identical. Each browser manufacturer has implemented different properties, events,  and  methods  for  its  specific  document  object.  Even  when  both  of  the  major browsers provide their  document objects with properties that share the same name, those properties do not always behave exactly the same. This is a very frustrating prob- lem for JavaScript programmers. Fortunately, there is a subset of document properties that act pretty much the same on both browsers. This book sticks with the properties that work the same on either browser. That way, your Web page won’t exclude any users simply because they do not have the browser that you used to create your page.  T R I C K  Always check your programs in both the major browsers. Something that works great in one browser won’t necessarily work in the other without some tweaking.  Methods The  document object also has some interesting methods. These are things that the document can do. The Document Methods program demonstrates some of the most important of the document object’s methods.  The Document Methods Program The Document Methods program has an old-fashioned prompt for getting input to the user, but the program then incorporates that value directly into the Web page  see Figures 4.7 and 4.8 .   72  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 4.7  The Document  Methods program prompts for the  user’s name with a prompt statement.  FIGURE 4.8  The program  incorporates the  user’s name into the actual Web page.  After getting input from the user, the program uses that input to modify the actual Web page as it is being written to the browser. The program does so by invoking the write   method of the document object. Take a look at the code for this program:         Document Methods         Document Methods   73  C h a p t e r 4              T h e B a s i c M a d   L i b P r o g r a m a n d O b j e c t - B a s e d P r o g r a m m n g  i           Andy Harris     Demonstrates writing to the document  var userName = prompt "Hi!  What's your name?" ;          Document Methods    document.write "Welcome, " ;  document.write userName ;  document.write "!!" ;  document.close  ;                                This document actually has two script areas. The first one creates the variable userName and gets its value from the user via the prompt statement. Inside the document body is another script pair. This second script invokes the write   method of the document object several times, then the close   method of document. After the script finishes, there is a little more HTML.  T R A P  The preceding code is actually the code used to build this page. If you look at the source code of the page after the program has run, it will not be exactly the same. I’ll explain this anomaly in just a moment.  Using document.write   The document.write method allows you to write text to the current document. This is a nice capability, because it means you can modify the actual HTML that the user sees. In addition to writing plain text, you can write HTML tags that the browser will inter- pret as though they came directly from the original text file.  Using document.close   HTML documents don’t come across the Internet in one big piece. Instead, a Web page comes across as a long stream of text, which the browser then interprets for information about how to lay out the page. When a Web page comes across the Internet, you can’t really count on the browser laying it out until the entire page has come across. In fact,   IN THE REAL WORLD  Although  the  d o c u m e n t . write   method  looks  like  a great  way  to  interact  with  the user, it has some serious limita- tions. The method can’t really be interactive,  because  the  docu- ment  can  be  closed  only  one time. Programmers usually use the method only for very simple tasks such as reporting the cur- rent  time  or  customizing  the page. Chapter 6, “Petals around the Rose: Dynamic Output,” will show  you  how  you  can  work with other frames and windows. In these cases, the document. write   method will be more useful. Still, it is a good example of a method.  the  page  sends  a  signal  telling  the  browser,  in  ef- fect, that it is finished sending the information nec- essary to display the page. When you generate por- tions of a Web page via JavaScript, you are essentially changing the page as it loads. The browser will not necessarily  write  new  information  just  because  a document.write method has executed. You can signal to the browser that you are done writing by invok- ing the close   method of the document object.  Events Recall that objects have properties, methods, and events. To demonstrate how events work, I’ll move away from the document object a little bit and ex- amine  the  most  common  kind  of  event  in  the graphical programming world, clicking a button.  The Don’t Click Program The Don’t Click program poses an irresistible chal- lenge to the user. It incorporates an HTML form with a button, as shown in Figures 4.9 and 4.10.  74  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 4.9  There’s that button, just daring the user  to click it.   75  C h a p t e r 4              T h e B a s i c M a d   L i b P r o g r a m a n d O b j e c t - B a s e d P r o g r a m m n g  i        When the user clicks the button, the program complains. It then waits for the user to click again. Here’s the code for the Don’t Click program:  FIGURE 4.10  The user couldn’t  resist the temptation.   Don't Click        Don't Click             <input type = "button"        value = "Don't Click Me!!"        onClick = 'alert "ouch!!" '>                       This program is unusual because it does not contain a  script tag pair. Still, it does have some JavaScript code. The other interesting thing about this program is its use of HTML forms.   76  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  The form Object Many JavaScript programs are related to HTML forms, because forms are containers for interesting components such as text boxes and command buttons. To make a form, just surround a part of your HTML code with a    pair. Inside that form, you can add the   elements such as text boxes, command buttons, and radio but- tons. It’s a good idea to name forms and the elements that they contain, so you can refer to these objects in code. Note that I named the form object when I defined it:     The name attribute is used to add a name to various HTML elements. I almost always name my forms something like myForm. It usually doesn’t matter too much what you name a form, but you should name it something.  T R A P  Do not forget to close your form. If you do not include a   tag, some brows- ers will display very strange results.  Inside the form, I have placed a command button. Here is the code that does that work:  <input type = "button"        value = "Don't Click Me!!"        onClick = 'alert "ouch!!" '>  The input object is a versatile HTML object. It is used to generate several elements; in this example, it creates a button. The type attribute determines which type of element to generate. The  value element describes what to write on the button. The  onClick attribute is the part that performs the magic.  The onClick Event HTML buttons have an onClick attribute. The value of this attribute is very special. It can contain one line of JavaScript code. Whenever a user clicks the button, the onClick event is triggered and the browser runs that one line of JavaScript. In this case, the onClick attribute contains the JavaScript code to generate the alert statement.  T R I C K  Note the use of single and double quotation marks. JavaScript and HTML both allow you to alternate single and double quotes, to avoid confusion.  Although the onClick event is very useful, it can be somewhat limiting to be restricted to that one line of JavaScript code. Fortunately, JavaScript, like most languages, en- ables you to generate new virtual commands, so that just one statement in the onClick attribute can call an unlimited number of commands. As usual, an example, the Don’t Click Function program, helps to explain this concept better than plain old text.  The Don’t Click Function Program Figures 4.11 and 4.12 show the Don’t Click Function program. This variation of the Don’t Click program looks very similar to the original program, but it is not identical.   77  C h a p t e r 4              T h e B a s i c M a d   L i b P r o g r a m a n d O b j e c t - B a s e d P r o g r a m m n g  i        FIGURE 4.11  The Don’t Click Function program starts out the same way as the Don’t Click program.  FIGURE 4.12  The alert  statement pops up and the background  color changes.  When the user clicks the button this time, the program does two things: It displays an alert dialog box and changes the background color. Clearly the one-line limitation will not allow this without some minor trickery. If you look under the hood, you’ll see that this program has some new structural elements:            Don't Click Function    function sayOuch  {       Don't Click Function       Andy Harris       demonstrates use of functions    document.bgColor = "red";    alert  "ouch!!" ;    document.bgColor = "white";  }    end function   Don't Click Function       <input type = button         value = "really, don't click me."         onClick = sayOuch  >  78  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i                             The header area includes a script that the button’s onClick event seems to invoke. The button still has one line of JavaScript in the onClick attribute, but that line of code is not standard JavaScript.  The Purpose of Functions If someone were to ask you what you did this morning before work, you would prob- ably say something like “I got up, took a shower, got dressed, ate breakfast, and drove to work.”  You probably wouldn’t describe all the details of your breakfast  “I walked into the kitchen, got a spoon and a bowl, found the cereal, got milk from the refrigera- tor…”  because the phrase “ate breakfast” covers all of those details.  Functions work in exactly the same way. You can put together a series of commands and give them a name. Then, whenever you want the computer to follow that series of steps again, you just use the name as if it were a command built into the language. This is exactly how the Don’t Click Function program is built.  Creating a Function Look again at the script inside the header area of the HTML:  function sayOuch  {   79  C h a p t e r 4              T h e B a s i c M a d   L i b P r o g r a m a n d O b j e c t - B a s e d P r o g r a m m n g  i             Don't Click Function       Andy Harris       demonstrates use of functions    document.bgColor = "red";    alert  "ouch!!" ;    document.bgColor = "white";  }    end function  The header section begins with a function definition. The term sayOuch   is the name of the function. The parentheses are used to indicate that no special values will be sent to this function.  You’ll get to send parameters in another chapter.  Most of the code is enclosed inside a pair of braces and indented to indicate it is part of some kind of structure. Most JavaScript programs are actually defined in the header as a function or as multiple functions. These functions are called from events of form elements inside the body of the HTML document. Defining a function in the header area guarantees that the function will be in memory by the time it is needed as the browser is inter- preting the rest of the document.  Calling a Function from an Event Once a function is defined, it is a simple matter to use it. In the rest of the document, the  function  simply  becomes  another  JavaScript  command.  Here’s  where  I  used sayOuch  :  <input type = button         value = "really, don't click me."         onClick = "sayOuch  ">  When the user clicks the button, the program automatically calls the sayOuch   func- tion. Program control jumps to that function, which changes the document color, alerts the user, and changes the color back.  Event-Driven Input and Output The use of HTML forms and event-handling capabilities can be combined to allow more graceful input and output than the dialog boxes that you have been using so far. Dia- log boxes are functional, but they tend to annoy the user, because they interrupt the natural flow of the program. It would be much better to have the input and output be more naturally integrated into the Web page.  Creating the Name Grabber Program Figures 4.13 and 4.14 show the Name Grabber program, which uses text boxes to handle input and output. This program doesn’t use any dialog boxes at all.  The Name Grabber program does input and output by manipulating elements of the form. This program introduces only one new feature: HTML text boxes.  The text boxes replace both the prompt and the alert dialog boxes.   80  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 4.13  The page that the Name Grabber program displays contains text boxes.  Users type their name into the first  text box.  FIGURE 4.14  After the user clicks  the button, a  greeting pops up in the second text box.

The  easiest  way  to  understand  what’s happening  is  to  look  at  the  code  as  two  main  segments:  the  HTML  code  and  the copyName   function.   82  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Writing the HTML Code First, take a look at the HTML code. When you’re looking at somebody else’s JavaScript code, it’s generally a good idea to look at the HTML code before you worry about the JavaScript code, because the HTML sets the stage. This program’s HTML code consists of a form with three elements. The form is named  myForm, and it has a text box, a button, and another text box.  T R I C K  Tables and forms are a really great combination. Often I hide the table border  <table border = 0> , but I have learned that forms lend themselves to the kind of organi- zation that I want on the screen. As you gain more experience, try other ways of arranging HTML  such as cascading style sheet positionable elements, discussed in Chapter 8, “Dynamic HTML: The Stealth Submarine,”  and develop a style that works best for your pages.  Take a look at the code that generated the first text box:  <input type = "text"         name = "txtName">  This is another form of the input tag, but this time the type is set to text, giving the text box a totally different appearance and behavior. The browser places a text box on the form. The code specifies no value attribute, so the text box starts out blank but enables the user to type into it. The text box’s name attribute is set to txtName. You’ll see in a moment that it is critical to name this text box.  T R I C K  Many programmers use prefixes such as txt to denote text boxes and cmd to de- note command buttons. This convention makes it easier to manage your code when you have a large number of objects defined. When you look at the term txtName, it’s easy to guess that it describes a text box that has something to do with a name.  The code that generates the other text box is not terribly different, but the second text box is named txtGreeting.  It also has no value specified, so it also starts out blank.  The code for the button is as follows:  <input type = "button"           value = "click me"           onClick = "copyName  ">  This code generates a button with the label “click me.” When the user clicks the but- ton,  the  copyName    function  should  execute.  The  next  section  explains  what  the copyName   function does.  Writing the copyName   Function The copyName   function is built in the header of the HTML document. It looks a bit different than some of the other scripts that you have seen so far:  function copyName  {        Name Grabber       Andy Harris       demonstrates form-based I O    var greeting = "Hi there, ";    var userName = document.myForm.txtName.value;    greeting += userName;    greeting += "!";  }    end copyName    document.myForm.txtGreeting.value = greeting;  The script starts by creating some variables, greeting and userName. Take a careful look at the line that gets a value for  userName. It looks really intimidating, but it actually isn’t that complex. document.myForm.txtName.value is another name for the contents  of  the  txtName  text  box.  The  document  object  has  as  a  property  the  form myForm. This object has a txtName property, which is the text box. The text box in turn has a  value property, which represents whatever text is in the text box  see Figure 4.15 . It works very much like a complex path in an operating system. If you see a filename like c:\documents\memos\incriminating\extortion.doc, you can tell that the filename is referring to a specific file in a tree structure.  When you build an HTML form, you are also building a complex structure just as you do as you build new folders in a file management system. In HTML, however, the pat- tern is a little more rigid. The form is a node, and all the objects inside the form are nodes. Each of these objects might have its own properties, such as value. It’s actually quite an elegant solution. Note the following line:  var userName = document.myForm.txtName.value;  The net result of this line is to copy the value of  txtName to the  userName variable. document.myForm.txtName.value essentially becomes a variable that you can assign values to and from, just like any other variable. Once you understand this, the follow- ing line makes perfect sense as well:  document.myForm.txtGreeting.value = greeting;  This line simply copies the value of the greeting variable to txtGreeting, which makes the value visible to the user.  83  C h a p t e r 4              T h e B a s i c M a d   L i b P r o g r a m a n d O b j e c t - B a s e d P r o g r a m m n g  i        document myForm  txtName  value  txtGreeting  value  FIGURE 4.15  This diagram  illustrates how the various elements of the Name Grabber  Web page are connected.   84  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Back to the Mad Lib Program The Mad Lib program turns out to be very straightforward once you know how to do form-based input and output. Since the code is getting a little long, I will show it to you broken into sections. You should look on the CD included with this book for the entire program. Besides, it’s more fun to play the game yourself.  Planning the Game The first step is to build the story. There are a lot of ways to do this. If you are naturally creative, just write a story and keep track of the words that you want to use as “fill-in” words—the words that you want to replace with the user’s choices. Be sure to write out the entire story and the list of “fill-in” words before you start programming. Have the story written out so you know exactly what you will need to be doing in the code. Sketch out the form on paper. Write down the names of any of the objects that you will be using  most likely text boxes, a text area, and a button . This planning will make your coding much easier.  Building the HTML Code Build the HTML first. Match closely the visual layout of the program that you sketched earlier, with all the text boxes and text areas generally in the right places. Don’t forget to name the form, text boxes, and text area. You don’t need to name the button, be- cause you will never access any of its properties, but you can if you wish. Here is my HTML code:  Note that it does not yet include any JavaScript code.  I will show you that in the next section.          Mad Lib           Please enter the following information      A person's name             A silly sound                            A body part              A vehicle             A type of animal                    <input type = button             value = "click for story"             onClick = makeML  >  <textarea name = txtStory            rows = 10            cols = 40            wrap>                                                 Note especially the use of the text area. The output will be a long story, and I need a place to put it. A text area is perfect for this. Turning on the word-wrap feature  with the wrap attribute  ensures that the entire story will be visible without requiring you to put in carriage returns. Also notice that I rigged up the button to trigger the makeML   function  which doesn’t yet exist . It’s a great idea to test your HTML code before you start working on the JavaScript code.  85  C h a p t e r 4              T h e B a s i c M a d   L i b P r o g r a m a n d O b j e c t - B a s e d P r o g r a m m n g  i         86  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Getting the Inputs Once the HTML is solid, you can turn your attention to the function itself. Here is the beginning of the function definition:  function makeML  {       Mad Lib       Andy Harris       make a silly story from a bunch of input terms      get variables from form    var person = window.document.myForm.txtPerson.value;    var sound = document.myForm.txtSound.value;    var part = document.myForm.txtPart.value;    var vehicle = document.myForm.txtVehicle.value;    var animal = document.myForm.txtAnimal.value;    var story = "";  This part of the program simply creates variables and extracts them from the various elements of the form. It is not coincidental that person and txtPerson are so similar. In a repetitive program such as this one, it is wise to generate some kind of naming convention so that you can keep track of all the various form elements and the vari- ables to which they are related. The story variable will contain the entire story before it is displayed in the text area.  Building a Long String Building the story turns out to be one of the easier things to do. Take a look at how I did that:  story = "One day, a person named " ;    story += person;    story += " was walking down the street. Suddenly, ";    story += person;    story += " heard an awful ";    story += sound;    story += " sound. ";    story += person;    story += " looked around and saw that the ";    story += sound;    story += " sound was coming from a ";    story +=  vehicle;    story += " careening madly down the street. ";    story +=  person;    story += person;    story += "'s fear turned to terror as "   87  C h a p t e r 4              T h e B a s i c M a d   L i b P r o g r a m a n d O b j e c t - B a s e d P r o g r a m m n g  i          story += " was driven by none other than the evil Super-";    story += ", it had befallen a strange transformation after ";    story += "being dropped in a vat of nuclear waste. ";    story += " realized that the ";    story += vehicle;    story += animal;    story += ".  Once an ordinary ";    story += animal;    story += "Super-"    story += animal;    story += " continued to taunt ";    story += person    story += " with the horrible ";    story += sound;    story += " noise, but ";    story += person;    story += " was unconcerned. \"You can't bother me, Super-";    story += animal;    story += "!  I know how to turn the other ";    story += part;    story += "!\"  \nThe End."    document.myForm.txtStory.value = story;  }    end makeML  I alternated text and variables. It would be very tempting to write long concatenations, as in the following example:  story += "Super-" + animal + " continued to taunt ";  The problem is that lines like this can be very difficult to debug.  T R A P  The reason lines like these can be difficult to debug is that it gets hard to figure out what is inside the quotes and is meant to be interpreted as a literal value, and what is outside the quotes, which will be interpreted as a variable or function name.  For example, will the preceding line actually print the word “animal” or will it print the value of the animal variable?  It all depends on the placement of the quotes and the plus signs.  One more interesting thing to note is the use of \" in the last line of the story  as well as  a  few  other  places .    The  backslash  character  indicates  that  the  quotation  mark should not be interpreted as the end of the string, but literally as a quotation mark.  Once the story is built, it is a simple matter to copy it to the txtStory text area for output.

You learned about the notion of objects and  their  principal  characteristics.  You  began  to  explore  properties,  methods,  and events. You took a first look at the document object, and at how event-driven program- ming ties JavaScript more closely to the Web page. You also learned how to copy values to and from text fields and text areas. In the next chapter, you will learn how to work with other kinds of screen components, such as radio buttons, check boxes, and drop- down lists.  The next chapter continues to develop the Mad Lib program by adding a number of other user interface elements to the screen.  1.

C H A P T E R  5  Advanced Mad Lib:  Using the Other Form Elements  In the last chapter, the programs accepted  all user input in text boxes and text areas. Although the basic text elements are ex- tremely flexible, HTML and JavaScript allow you to use a number of other screen components. In this chapter, you will learn how to work with other ele- ments of an HTML form, and how JavaScript inter- acts with them. Specifically, you will learn how to do the following:    Use other text-based elements, such as pass-  word and hidden input boxes    Create and interact with forms that use  check boxes    Use radio buttons and understand how they  differ from check boxes    Organize screen elements into arrays    Build and use selection lists for user input   90  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Project: The Advanced Mad Lib In this chapter, you will build a variation of the Mad Lib game from Chapter 4, “The Basic Mad Lib Program and Object-Based Programming.” The basic idea will be the same, but the form on this version will have a number of elements that users expect from a graphical user interface  see Figure 5.1 .  These elements make the user interface a little more convenient for users, because they usually do not have to type as much. The elements are also convenient for the programmer, because they limit the user’s choices to only legitimate values.  Working with Text-Like Objects You learned how to manipulate the text box and text area in the last chapter. JavaScript has a number of elements that are very similar from the programmer’s perspective. These elements  like most form components  are created with variations of the HTML   tag.  The Password Program The Password program demonstrates some of the text-like input elements  see Figure 5.2 . Although only four elements are visible on the page, the page actually includes five elements.  The user chooses an option from a drop-down list.  Here the user selects one or more elements from a group of checkboxes.  The user can choose only one of these options.  FIGURE 5.1  In this version of the Mad Lib program, the form features a number of special  elements.   91  C h a p t e r 5  A d v a n c e d M a d   L i b     :       U s i n g   t h e O t h e r   F o r m E l e m e n t s     The layout of the screen is reasonably straightforward. Here is the HTML code that generates the screen layout:  FIGURE 5.2  The Password  program’s interface  features several text-like input  elements.         Password             Please enter password      <input type = "password"               name = "pwdGuess">                                     <input type = "button"             value = "click me"             onClick = "checkPass  ">    92  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i             <textArea name = "txtOutput"                rows = 1                cols = 35>                           <input type = "hidden"         name = "hdnSecret"         value = "JavaScript">                     Password   function checkPass  {       Password       Andy Harris  The form is laid out inside a table, and the table contains four elements. The first is a password box, then a button, and finally a text area. Outside the table is a fifth input element, a hidden field. This fifth field contains the correct password. When the user clicks the button, a function called checkPass   is executed. Here is the code for the checkPass   function:       demonstrates several textlike elements    var guess = document.myForm.pwdGuess.value;    var secret = document.myForm.hdnSecret.value;    if  guess == secret {      document.myForm.txtOutput.value = "You may proceed.";      document.myForm.txtOutput.value = "That is incorrect.";    } else {    }    end if  }    end checkPass        This function extracts the relevant details from the various form elements, compares the values, and returns an appropriate message.   93  C h a p t e r 5  A d v a n c e d M a d   L i b     :       U s i n g   t h e O t h e r   F o r m E l e m e n t s     Password Boxes Password boxes are almost identical to text boxes as far as HTML and JavaScript are con- cerned. The only real differences are that an   HTML statement generates the password and that asterisks  *  replace any values that the user types into the text field. The actual characters that the user types are still recorded, but the field displays only the asterisks. This prevents the KGB, Mafia, aliens, or whoever else from stealing your password by looking over your shoulder as you enter your password into the page. Pass- word fields have a value property, and you can use JavaScript to copy values to and from the password in exactly the same way as you do with an ordinary text field.  T R A P  The password field is notoriously insecure, especially when used in JavaScript. The  user  can  figure  out  the  correct  password  by  looking  at  the  source  code. JavaScript is not secure enough for any transaction that involves real security, but the password field can still be fun in game programming. You might use it as a “mood enhancer” if you’re writing a game where the player is supposed to be a hacker, for example. You might also use the field in other instances where you want light secu- rity but secrecy isn’t vital, such as to allow players to skip levels in an arcade game.  Hidden Fields The other interesting element in this example is the hidden field. If you look closely at the HTML code, you will see this element listed:  <input type = "hidden"         name = "hdnSecret"         value = "JavaScript">  The code is much like that of text boxes and password boxes, but the hidden field has different behavior. It stores a value in a form, but the value is not visible at all to the user. In this example, I used the hidden field to store the correct password. You can use hidden fields in game programming to store values in the form. However, as a JavaScript programmer, you can do the same thing with variables, so hidden fields usually aren’t necessary in JavaScript programs.  H I N T  Why does the hidden field exist? If the hidden field isn’t necessary, you might be surprised that it is supported at all in HTML. HTML supports the hidden field be- cause programmers can attach HTML forms to programs written in many other kinds of languages. Sometimes an HTML form is connected to a program on the Web server. In these kinds of programs, hidden fields can be very useful, because the program can store information in the form that the program will need later.  Using Check Boxes In some situations, the user should be able to choose from a group of elements. In other situations, the user should be able to choose any number of available options. The Music Chooser program presents users with check boxes that enable them to do both.   94  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 5.3  The form accepts  any number of check-box inputs and returns an  appropriate output.  The Music Chooser Program As shown in Figure 5.3, the Music Chooser program asks users to select their favorite music genre through a group of check boxes.  The user can choose any of a series of check boxes. It’s important to note that these boxes are not mutually exclusive. The status of any one check box has no particular effect on all the other check boxes. Most users have seen this type of input element before and know the kind of behavior to expect from it.  The Code for Creating Check Boxes in HTML To understand how to write code for a group of check boxes, it is helpful to look at the HTML code. Check boxes are another variant of the input element. The HTML code that generates the Music Chooser screen looks like this:  Note that this code is only the HTML. The JavaScript code will be added in the next section.   Please tell me what music you like:          Music Chooser                <input type = "checkbox"           name = "chkCountry"   95  C h a p t e r 5  A d v a n c e d M a d   L i b     :       U s i n g   t h e O t h e r   F o r m E l e m e n t s              value = "country">country     <input type = "checkbox"           name = "chkRock"           value = "rock">rock     <input type = "checkbox"           name = "chkRap"           value = "rap">rap     <input type = "checkbox"           name = "chkClassical"           value = "classical">classical     <input type = "checkbox"           name = "chkBlues"           value = "blues">blues     <input type = "button"           value = "click me"           onClick = "processMusic  ">  <textarea name = "txtOutput"            rows = 10            cols = 35>                                                                           96  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i           The preceding is reasonably straightforward HTML code. It includes the expected form, with a series of check boxes. Each check box has a name and a value. Note that the value of a check box is not visible to the user. If you want to connect a label to a check box, you need to write that label as ordinary HTML code. It is very common to put checkbox elements in a list or table as I did here, to keep them neat. The code also contains a button to trigger the processMusic   function and a text area to contain the output of that function.  The Behavior of Check Boxes The code to manipulate check-box components is also reasonably straightforward. The checkbox object has a value property, which corresponds to the value stored when the object was created in HTML. Check boxes also have another important property, checked. This property contains a true or false value. If the user selects the check box  and it was previously unchecked , the checked property is true. Usually you will want your pro- gram to do something only if the user has selected the check box. In this program, you want to execute the processMusic   function if the user selects a check box.  Here’s the code for the processMusic   function:  function processMusic  {       Music Chooser       Andy Harris       demonstrates check boxes    document.myForm.txtOutput.value = "";    if  document.myForm.chkCountry.checked == true {      document.myForm.txtOutput.value += "You like ";      document.myForm.txtOutput.value += document.myForm.chkCountry.value;      document.myForm.txtOutput.value += "\n";    }    end if    if  document.myForm.chkRock.checked == true {      document.myForm.txtOutput.value += "You like ";      document.myForm.txtOutput.value += document.myForm.chkRock.value;      document.myForm.txtOutput.value += "\n";    }    end if    if  document.myForm.chkRap.checked == true {      document.myForm.txtOutput.value += "You like ";      document.myForm.txtOutput.value += document.myForm.chkRap.value;      document.myForm.txtOutput.value += "\n";   97  C h a p t e r 5  A d v a n c e d M a d   L i b     :       U s i n g   t h e O t h e r   F o r m E l e m e n t s       }    end if    if  document.myForm.chkClassical.checked == true {      document.myForm.txtOutput.value += "You like ";      document.myForm.txtOutput.value += document.myForm.chkClassical.value;      document.myForm.txtOutput.value += "\n";    }    end if    if  document.myForm.chkBlues.checked == true {      document.myForm.txtOutput.value += "You like ";      document.myForm.txtOutput.value += document.myForm.chkBlues.value;      document.myForm.txtOutput.value += "\n";    }    end if  }    end processMusic  Although this looks like a lot of code, the function isn’t nearly as complex as it seems at first glance. If you examine the code more closely, you can see that it really is very repetitive. The code is basically nothing more than a series of if statements. Each one checks a specific check box to see whether the user has selected it. If so, the function writes the value of that check box to the text area.  H I N T  Check boxes are usually used to let the user turn certain options on or off. You might use a check box in a preferences screen, for example, to indicate a number of op- tions that the user can turn on or off.  It is important to remember that each check box is basically an independent entity. The values of the various check boxes are not related in any particular way, and each check box must be evaluated independently in the code.  Using Radio Buttons Check boxes have a cousin called radio buttons. Radio buttons are similar to check boxes, but they behave differently when you place them in groups. They are used when you want the user to choose only one element from a group. Radio buttons get their name from the old car radios that had little buttons sticking out for the preselected stations.  When  you  pressed  a  button,  all  the  others  would  automatically  stick  out, because radios can be tuned to only one station at a time.  Creating the Size Chooser Program The Size Chooser program provides an example of an HTML-JavaScript radio button group in action. Figures 5.4 and 5.5 show the program.  When the user clicks the OK button, the program agrees to get the appropriate size of whatever it is the user is ordering.   98  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 5.4  The user has selected a small size.  FIGURE 5.5  When the user then selects Large, the  Small option is automatically unchecked.        Generating Radio Buttons in HTML Code The HTML code to make radio buttons starts out very much like that of the other screen components that you have seen. But see whether you can spot the one significant dif- ference in the code:  Please  note  that  this  is  simply  the  HTML  code  for  this  program.  I’ll  show  you  the JavaScript in the next section.   99  C h a p t e r 5  A d v a n c e d M a d   L i b     :       U s i n g   t h e O t h e r   F o r m E l e m e n t s                                                             Size Chooser        Which size would you like?          <input type = "radio"             name = radSize             value = "small">Small      <input type = "radio"             name = radSize             value = "medium">Medium      <input type = "radio"             name = radSize             value = "large">Large      <input type = "radio"             name = radSize             value = "jumbo">Jumbo                  <input type = "button"             value = "OK"             onClick = "processSize  ">                    <textarea name = "txtOutput"            rows = 5            cols = 40>   100                 i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  If you didn’t see the strange new feature, take another look at the names of the radio buttons. All the radio buttons have the same name! I’ll explain in the next section why I did that. For now, just note that the rest of the HTML code is pretty straightforward. There is a button attached to a function and a text area for output, just as in all the other programs in this chapter.  Placing Buttons in  Arrays What makes radio buttons special is the way that they act when placed in groups. Check boxes, as you recall, are pretty independent creatures. They don’t really care whether the user has selected any other neighboring check boxes. Radio buttons, on the  other  hand,  are  team  players.  Each  radio  button  expects  to  be  part  of  a  group. Whenever  one  button  in  the  group  is  turned  on,  all  the  others  will  be  turned  off. Somehow you need to make all the buttons in a group aware of which group they are in. In HTML code, you make all the radio buttons part of a group by giving them all the same name.  Although it seems kind of strange to have a bunch of things with the same name, it isn’t really all that unusual. If you’re playing golf, you might have a scorecard that looks something like Figure 5.6.  A small golf course might have nine holes. The holes are usually numbered. Each golfer keeps track of how many strokes it takes to get the ball in the cup. In effect, the golfer has a score for each hole. The golfer might refer to the first score as the score for hole 1. The next score would be the score for hole 2, and so on.  Hyper Links  Hole  Score  4 3 5  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  FIGURE 5.6  A scorecard for a  golfer.   101  C h a p t e r 5  A d v a n c e d M a d   L i b     :       U s i n g   t h e O t h e r   F o r m E l e m e n t s     Programming languages usually refer to this kind of structure as an array. An array is a group of similar things, all with the same name, but with different numeric indices. JavaScript refers to an array with square bracket  []  notation. By generating a series of radio buttons all with the same name, you have created an array. Programming lan- guages  usually  count  beginning  at  0,  so  the  Small  radio  button  is  also  known  as radSize[0], the Medium radio button is radSize[1], and so on.  Using Variables to Simplify the Code The code for a series of radio buttons looks a little bit intimidating, but when you look at it a little bit at a time, it isn’t too bad. Before you see the code itself, here’s the strategy. I’ll use a for loop to generate numbers from 0 to 3. Each time through the loop, I’ll look at the appropriately numbered radio button. If the user selected that button, I’ll remember the value associated with that button in a variable. After the loop completes, the variable will contain the value of whichever button the user clicked. Take a look at the code, and you’ll see how I did it:     function processSize  {       Size Chooser       Andy Harris       Demonstrates radio buttons    var size;    var i;    var theOption;    for  i = 0; i <= 3; i++ {      theOption = document.myForm.radSize[i];      if  theOption.checked == true {        size = theOption.value;      }    end if    }    end for loop  }    end function       document.myForm.txtOutput.value = "OK, I'll get you the ";    document.myForm.txtOutput.value += size + " one.";  The function starts out simply enough. The size variable will eventually contain the size of object that the user is ordering. The variable i is used in the for loop.  This is one of those instances where the actual value of the for loop counter does not matter, so  i  is  an  appropriate  variable  name.   The  last  variable,  theOption,  is  a  little  more puzzling. JavaScript allows you to store many kinds of things in variables. You can even store an object in a variable. Doing so can make your life quite a bit simpler, as you will see in a moment.  The following line begins a for loop that will repeat three times:  for  i = 0; i <= 3; i++ {  The value of i will  at various times  be 0, 1, 2, and 3. Remember that JavaScript begins counting at 0. Because there are four radio buttons, they will be numbered 0 to 3.   102  The following line gets the ith button:  theOption = document.myForm.radSize[i];  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  When i is 0, document.myForm.radSize[0]  the radio button associated with the value small  will be copied to the variable theOption. Every time through the loop, i will have a different value, and another radio button will be copied to the theOption variable.  The next line checks whether the user has selected the current radio button:  if  theOption.checked == true {  If the value is true, the following line copies the value property of the object to the size variable:  size = theOption.value; If the current radio button is not selected, nothing happens. The loop continues until all four radio buttons have been checked.  The last two lines generate output for the txtOutput text area:    document.myForm.txtOutput.value = "OK, I'll get you the ";    document.myForm.txtOutput.value += size + " one.";  You can replicate the following general strategy any time you want to get the value of the currently selected radio button:  1. Create variables for the loop, for the result, and to hold a reference to a radio  2. Make a for loop that steps from 0 to the number of buttons in the group  button.  minus 1.  3. Assign the current button to the button variable. 4. If the button is selected, copy the value to the result variable. 5. Repeat the loop until it has checked all buttons.  Of course, for every group of radio buttons that you use on the page, you will need to repeat this procedure. Fortunately, you can copy and paste it and just modify the new version to fit each particular group of radio buttons.  Using the select Object The last of the new elements that you will look at in this chapter is the select object. This is also known as a list box in many programming languages. The Color Chooser program is an example that uses a select object.  Creating the Color Chooser Program The Color Chooser program displays a list of colors  see Figure 5.7 . When the user clicks the list box, the list of colors drops down. After the user selects a color from the list, the selected color is then displayed in the list box. When the user clicks the OK button, the document’s background color is reset to the selected color  see Figure 5.8 .  This type of selection object is efficient because it takes up less space on the screen than the equivalent set of option buttons.   103  C h a p t e r 5  A d v a n c e d M a d   L i b     :       U s i n g   t h e O t h e r   F o r m E l e m e n t s     FIGURE 5.7  The user is about to select yellow from the drop-down list.  FIGURE 5.8  The background has  changed to the selected color.  Creating the select Object in HTML Here’s the HTML that was used to generate the select object:         Color Chooser     Please select a color             red      orange      yellow      green      blue      indigo      violet   <input type = "button"         value = "change color"         onClick = "changeColor  ">                    104  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  You  may  recall  that  the  HTML  select  object  is  basically  a  container  for  a  series  of option objects. The  select object should have a name, and each  option object will have a value. It is not necessary to name each option object. Because the select object contains a bunch of option objects, they are stored as an array.  Getting the Choice The procedure for obtaining the value of the currently selected option is actually a bit easier in a selection object than it is with a set of radio buttons, because the select object itself can supply you with some useful information. When you wanted to evalu- ate a set of radio buttons, you had to look at each button to figure out which one was clicked. The select object has a built-in property that tells you which button was clicked. Here’s my code:     function changeColor  {       Color Chooser       Andy Harris       demonstrates select object used as a drop-down list box    var theSelect = document.myForm.selColor;    var theOption = theSelect[theSelect.selectedIndex];    var theColor = theOption.value;    document.bgColor = theColor;  }    end changeColor     This code’s brevity might surprise you. Essentially, the code simply picks apart the selection object until it gets the value that I need. Then the code stores the value in the theColor variable. The following line of code begins this process:  var theSelect = document.myForm.selColor;   105  C h a p t e r 5  A d v a n c e d M a d   L i b     :       U s i n g   t h e O t h e r   F o r m E l e m e n t s     This  line  creates  a  variable  called  theSelect.  That  variable  is  a  reference  to  the selection object itself. This line isn’t absolutely necessary, but it makes the follow- ing  lines  much  easier  to  read,  because  you  don’t  have  to  write  all  that document.myForm.selColor.blah.blah business every time.  The next line is similar:  var theOption = theSelect[theSelect.selectedIndex];  This line generates a variable to hold an option button. The variable contains the currently selected element. The select object has a selectedIndex property, which returns the index of the selected element. The  theSelect variable has an array of options, and by indicating the  theSelect.selectedIndex value, this line copies to the theOption variable a reference to the option that the user selected.  It then becomes a simple matter to retrieve the value of this option, with the follow- ing line:  var theColor = theOption.value; Once the color is stored in a variable, you can copy it to the bgColor property of the document and thus change the page’s background color:  document.bgColor = theColor;  Using Multiline Select Boxes The select box turns out to be a very adaptable feature. In addition to the behavior that you have just seen, a select box can be set up to show multiple lines on the screen, and to allow the user to select more than one option at a time. The Color II program de- scribed in this section is a variation of the Color Chooser program that takes advan- tage of these capabilities.  Creating the Color II Program The Color II program is modified from the Color Chooser program. Figure 5.9 shows this modified program.  For this program, you change the select box so that it can accept multiple values. Also, the program adds a text area for output. The user can select a series of elements in the select box, using Shift+click or Ctrl+click combinations. When the user clicks the but- ton, the selected element nearest to the top of the box will be used as the form’s new background, and all the selected values will be copied to the text area.  Modifying the HTML to Handle Multiple Selections It just takes a couple of modifications in the  select object’s HTML code to get the desired effect:  <select name = selColor          multiple          size = 7>  The multiple attribute tells the browser to allow multiple selections. However, mul- tiple selection doesn’t make sense in a typical drop-down list box. To have a number of   106  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 5.9  The user has chosen several  colors. The first one was applied to the form’s background. All selected colors  are listed in the  text area.  options visible at the same time, you must set the size attribute to some value. This page has seven elements, so I set the  size attribute to seven, although any number larger than 1 would do the trick. To get multiple selections, you must set the  size larger than 1 and also specify the multiple attribute.  The only other change to the HTML code is the creation of the text area for output. You’ve already seen this code several times in this chapter.  Writing Code to Handle Multiple Selections The  JavaScript  code  for  the  multiple  selection  Color  II  program  starts  just  like  the original Color Chooser program. It uses exactly the same code to extract a color for the background. When you set a select box for multiple selections, the selectedIndex prop- erty returns the index of the first selected item found. Here’s the code:  function changeColor  {       Color Chooser       Andy Harris       demonstrates select object used as a multiline list box      change color to the first selected color    var theSelect = document.myForm.selColor;    var theOption = theSelect[theSelect.selectedIndex];    var theColor = theOption.value;    document.bgColor = theColor;      list all the selected colors    var colorList = "";   107  C h a p t e r 5  A d v a n c e d M a d   L i b     :       U s i n g   t h e O t h e r   F o r m E l e m e n t s       var i = 0;    for  i = 0; i < theSelect.length; i++ {      theOption = theSelect.options[i];      if  theOption.selected == true {        colorList += theOption.value + "\n";      }    end if    }    end for loop  }    end changeColor    document.myForm.txtOutput.value = colorList;  The new code appears after the comment to list all selected colors. If you look carefully at this code, however, you will see that it is not as new as it might at first appear. The code looks very similar to the code used to check a series of radio buttons. First, I set up some variables to make a for loop counter and a string to contain the text that the program is to print to the text area. Then, I started a for loop:  for  i = 0; i < theSelect.length; i++ {  This loop continues as many times as there are elements in the  select object. The length property indicates the number of elements in the select object. The i variable gets values from 0 up to the number of options in the select object minus one.  The next line grabs the current option, then puts the option in the theOption variable:  theOption = theSelect.options[i];  Next I use an if statement to check whether the user has selected the current option:  if  theOption.selected == true {  If the user selected the option, the next line copies the value related to that option to the colorList variable, which the program prints in the text area:  colorList += theOption.value + "\n";  Returning to the Advanced Mad Lib Program The advanced Mad Lib program becomes simple to understand once you learn how to read the various elements. It introduces absolutely nothing new, but just combines the elements that you have already seen.  The HTML Code for the Advanced Mad Lib Program The HTML code sets the stage. It is not that complex, but you must plan it well or it will cause you great difficulty when you are writing the JavaScript code. Here is the HTML code:  I’ll show you the JavaScript in the next section          Mad Lib        Please enter the following information    108        A person's name             description s        <input type = "checkbox"             name = "chkEvil"             value = "evil">evil      <input type = "checkbox"             name = "chkGoofy"             value = "goofy">goofy      <input type = "checkbox"             name = "chkDysfunc"      <input type = "checkbox"             name = "chkWacky"             value = "wacky">wacky             value = "dysfunctional">dysfunctional  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i     A silly sound     <input type = "radio"           name = "optSound"           value = "phht!"> phht!    <input type = "radio"           name = "optSound"           value = "boing!"> boing!    <input type = "radio"           name = "optSound"           value = "whoosh!"> whoosh!    <input type = "radio"           name = "optSound"           value = "splat!"> splat!                                            109  C h a p t e r 5  A d v a n c e d M a d   L i b     :       U s i n g   t h e O t h e r   F o r m E l e m e n t s        A body part                      tooth          kidney stone          cheek          elbow          brain      A vehicle             A type of animal                    <input type = button             value = "click for story"             onClick = makeML  >                                                       <textarea name = txtStory            rows = 10            cols = 40            wrap>      110  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  The entire form is wrapped in a  table. It is very difficult to create a professional- looking form without using tables. If you aren’t already comfortable with tables, now is a good time to learn. It’s also a great idea to get used to the colspan and rowspan attributes  which allow cells to take up more space than they normally would be allot- ted . These attributes give you reasonable flexibility in your page design.  IN THE REAL WORLD  Your  choice  of  user  interface elements can be more than a matter of aesthetics. Using the correct type of input element can greatly simplify the user’s life  by  allowing  mouse  input instead of typing.  These elements  the check box, radio group, and select element  are  also  very  useful  from  the programmer’s point of view, be- cause  they  give  the  user  very limited  input  options.    Recall from the last chapter the warn- ings about how difficult it is to check  information  typed  into text  boxes  and  prompt state- ments.  If you use the input ele- ments described in this chapter, you  can  be  assured  that  all  in- puts will be legitimate, because the  values  were  designed  into the program.  The form contains a number of standard text input elements. These were copied directly from the pro- gram in the last chapter and need no modification.  The description element is new. I introduced it into the story just so you could see how you might use check boxes. The user can choose any combination of checkbox elements. It makes sense to group them together on the page, but such grouping is not ab- solutely necessary. Note that each checkbox element has a different name.  The program retrieves the sound value via a radio button set. Although the story can easily make use of more than one descriptive word, it requires only one  sound.  Because  you  want  the  user  to  select only one sound, the  sound value is a good candi- date for a radio button set. Placing all radio but- tons of a group together makes sense. Note also that the code assigns all of the radio buttons the same name, so that they can be accessed as an array.  The user selects the body part value with the assis- tance  of  a  drop-down  select  object.  This  makes sense for this particular story element, because the story requires only one body part.  The other elements, such as the button and the text area for output, remain identical to those of the original Mad Lib program.  The JavaScript Code All the JavaScript code for this project derives directly from the projects in the chapter. Here is the function:       make a silly story from a bunch of input terms  function makeML  {       Mad Lib       Andy Harris      create variables    var sound;    var part;    var descrip;   111  C h a p t e r 5  A d v a n c e d M a d   L i b     :       U s i n g   t h e O t h e r   F o r m E l e m e n t s       var vehicle;    var animal;    var story = "";      get text box variables    person = window.document.myForm.txtPerson.value;    vehicle = document.myForm.txtVehicle.value;    animal = document.myForm.txtAnimal.value;      get description    descrip = "";    if  document.myForm.chkEvil.checked==true {      descrip += document.myForm.chkEvil.value;      descrip += ", ";    }    end if    if  document.myForm.chkGoofy.checked==true {      descrip += document.myForm.chkGoofy.value;      descrip += ", ";    }    end if    if  document.myForm.chkDysfunc.checked==true {      descrip += document.myForm.chkDysfunc.value;      descrip += ", ";    }    end if    if  document.myForm.chkWacky.checked==true {      descrip += document.myForm.chkWacky.value;      descrip += ", ";    }    end if      story += "descrip: \t" + descrip + "\n";      get sound    for  i = 0; i <= 3; i++ {      if  document.myForm.optSound[i].checked == true {        sound = document.myForm.optSound[i].value;      }    end if    }    end for loop      get body part      story += "sound: \t" + sound + "\n";   112  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i    var theSelect = document.myForm.selBody;    var theOption = theSelect[theSelect.selectedIndex];    part = theOption.value;      story += "part: \t" + part + "\n";    story = "One day, a person named " ;    story += person;    story += " was walking down the street.

As a program gets large, it becomes more important to document carefully what is happening inside the program. Note the comments that explain what each part of the code is supposed to be doing. It’s also a good idea to use vertical space  that is, blank lines  to separate parts of the code from each other.  I made all the variables necessary for the story. The only new variable is the descrip variable, which did not exist in the original story.  TABLE 5.1 OBJECTS AND PROPERTIES USED FOR INPUT  Object.property  Checkbox.value  Checkbox.checked  Radio[i].value  Radio[i].checked  Selection.  selectedIndex  Selection[i]  theVar = myCheck.value; }     end if  Example  if  myCheck.checked {  Description Returns the value associated theVar = myCheck.value; with a specific check box object  defined in HTML . Returns true or false depending on whether the box is currently checked. Returns the value associated for i=0; i <5; i++ { with a specific radio button object  defined in HTML . Radio buttons are usually defined in an array. Returns true or false depending on whether the radio button is currently checked. Radio buttons are usually defined in an array. Returns the index of whichever option is currently " + mySelect. selected.   radio[i].checked {  }    end for loop  selectedIndex ;  loop  }    end if }    end for  for i=0; i <5; i++ {   if  theVar = myRadio[i].value;  theVar = myRadio[i].value;  alert  "you chose option   myOption = mySelect[3];  Option.value  alert  myOption.value ;  Returns the ith option in the array. Returns the value of a specified option  usually called as part of an array .   114  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  It is very easy to get values from ordinary text boxes, so I extracted values from the text boxes first and copied them all to the appropriate variables.  To get a value for the descrip variable, I needed to evaluate all the check boxes. I checked whether each check box’s value was true; if the value was true, I copied the check box’s value to the descrip variable.  T R I C K  Take a careful look at the following line:    story += "descrip: \t" + descrip + "\n";  The line is commented out, but it fulfills a very useful purpose. As I was testing the program, I wanted to be sure that the program was generating the value of the descrip variable correctly. I didn’t want to worry about all the string concatena- tion until I was sure that the variables were right, so I just wanted a simple version of the story that would just output the correct values. This line is part of that simple version that I used for debugging. I commented it out when I finished the debugging. However, I didn’t remove it completely, because I might want it back if I find some- thing else is going wrong. This kind of feedback line makes a great debugging tool.  I got values for the sound and the body  part by using variations of exactly the same code that you saw earlier in this chapter. To reuse the code, all I had to do was change a few variable names. This is a very good strategy.  I built the story just as I did for the original Mad Lib program, with a series of string concatenations. One neat trick is to embed the descrip list inside another list so that I don’t have to worry about whether a particular element needs a trailing comma.  Summary In this chapter, you learned much more about integrating HTML form elements into JavaScript. You got a feel for several of the main elements in GUIs, including check boxes, radio buttons, and selection objects. You also learned general strategies for get- ting values from each of these elements in your JavaScript code.  In the next chapter, you will look at some new ways to send output to the user.  E X E R C I S E S  1. Build a version of the Number Guesser program that uses radio buttons for input instead  of text fields.  2. Create a prototype order form that involves all the screen elements that you have learned  about so far. Have a text area return a summary of the information on the form.  3. Write a Rock Paper Scissors game using form elements for input.   C H A P T E R  6  Petals around  the Rose: Dynamic  Output  In this chapter, you will add the ability  to use HTML code itself as a form of output. Up  to  now,  all  your  output  has  been through text areas. Although this use of text areas is reasonably straightforward, it is limited. You will learn how you can use HTML itself as an output medium. Specifically, you will explore how to do the following:    Incorporate JavaScript and HTML frames    Write code that writes to another frame    Generate external windows    Control the behavior and appearance of  external windows    Write to external windows    Generate graphic images for games    Incorporate graphics in a simple game   Project: Petals around the Rose The game that you will write in this chapter is based on an old dice game. It is actually more like a puzzle. When played by humans, one person rolls five dice and asks “How many petals around the rose?” There is a specific pattern to the correct answers. The game turns out to be remarkably simple, but it can take you some time to figure out the solution. Figures 6.1 through 6.4 show the game’s interface.  116  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 6.1  The Petals around the Rose program  opens in two  frames, with a form on the top and five dice on the bottom.  FIGURE 6.2  When the user asks  for help, a new window pops up.   117  C h a p t e r 6     P e t a l s a r o u n d   t h e R o s e  :    D y n a m i c O u t p u t     FIGURE 6.3  After the user clicks the OK button, the  computer  determines whether  the guess was  correct.  FIGURE 6.4  Finally the user has  figured out the  pattern.  The game introduces a lot of new elements. It is the first game in this book that relies heavily on graphics. It also is the first game that integrates at least some of the output directly into the Web page itself, without using a text area or alert statement. The game also introduces a pop-up help screen, which is implemented as a second Web page.  To  build  this  game,  you  will  need  to  spend  some  time  on  each  of  these  new elements. Fortunately, the game itself is reasonably easy to build once all the pieces are in place.   118  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  IN THE REAL WORLD  Most Web applications involve some sort of dynamic interac- tion  with  the  screen.  Dialog boxes  are  ugly  and  interrupt the  flow  of  the  program.  The capability  to  generate  output dynamically  is  critical  to  any professional  Web  application. The techniques in this chapter that  allow  you  to  generate HTML in a JavaScript function and display HTML in a separate frame or window are useful in any kind of Web application.  Generating Output in Frames The first skill to master is to generate a page that can write HTML on the fly. This is a very important skill, because HTML is a very expressive language. If you want to incorporate graphics into your pro- grams, or have your program repeatedly build pages on-the-fly, you will need HTML, because it just isn’t possible to do these things well with the techniques that you’ve learned so far.  As you might remember from Chapter 4, you can use the document.write   method to write HTML to a document. However, this method has a significant drawback: It does not allow you to write to a docu- ment after it finishes loading to the browser. This is a big problem, because you cannot run functions until the browser has finished loading the page.  Creating the HTML Frame Tester Program It would seem impossible to write functions that can generate Web pages, but there is a loophole. Take a look at the Frame Tester program shown in Figures 6.5 and 6.6.  The Frame Tester program is a tool for teaching and practicing HTML. When you’re learning HTML, you can type any code into the text area, click the button, and see the results. You don’t even need a text editor.  The secret is that the input and output happen in two completely different pages. The form with the text area, the button, and the function is in the left side of a frameset,  FIGURE 6.5  The left side of the  page has a text area filled with HTML code.   119  C h a p t e r 6     P e t a l s a r o u n d   t h e R o s e  :    D y n a m i c O u t p u t     FIGURE 6.6  When the user clicks the Show Page button, the  code in the text area  is used to build a new page on the  right side.  and the right side is rebuilt by the function. Creating this program is not as compli- cated as it might sound.  Building the Frames Perhaps it will be helpful to review quickly frames in HTML. As you recall, a frameset involves a number of documents. Here’s the source of the main page in the Frame Tester program. The file name is ftMas.         HTML Tester - Frame version   <frameset border = 0            cols = "50%, 50%">         <frame src = "blank.html"           name = "frameOutput">        The page has no body area, only a head. The page contains a frameset element with two frames. The first frame contains the FrameTester.html page, and the second is set to blank.html. Note that I set the page to hide the frame border  border  =  0 . Such hiding is common when you are working in JavaScript if you want the results to look like one page. I have named the second frame frameOutput. It is especially important that you name frames that will handle output if you’ll be working with the frame through JavaScript. The blank.html page is simply an empty page that I use to initial- ize framesets.   Writing to a Second Frame The HTML code in FrameTester.html is very standard. As usual, the JavaScript will come later.  120  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i         Frame Tester       <textArea name = txtInput            rows = 10            cols = 30>         practice       practice page      <input type = "button"         value = "show page"         onClick = "buildPage  ">                          The HTML code simply sets up a text area and button. Note that the browser does not directly  interpret  the  code  between  the     and     tags  as  HTML code, but simply as the text inside the text area. The button triggers the buildPage   function. Here is how that function looks:  function buildPage  {       Frame Tester       Andy Harris       Demonstrates how to write HTML to another frame    var theCode = document.myForm.txtInput.value;    var theDoc = window.parent.frameOutput.document;    theDoc.open  ;    theDoc.write theCode ;    theDoc.close  ;  }    end buildPage   121  C h a p t e r 6     P e t a l s a r o u n d   t h e R o s e  :    D y n a m i c O u t p u t     The first line gets the text from the text area and copies it to the theCode variable. The second line is a little trickier:  var theDoc = window.parent.frameOutput.document; This line also creates a variable, but this variable is a reference to the document in the frameOutput frame. When a page has multiple frames, it becomes necessary to refer to the frameset itself. In this instance, I did so by adding a reference to window.parent. frameOutput  is  the  name  of  the  specific  frame,  and  it  has  a  document  object.  So, window.parent.frameOutput.document  is  a  reference  to  the  document  object  of  the frameOutput frame of the browser’s frameset.  H I N T  This whole naming scheme seems pretty unwieldy, but it isn’t really all that new. Think of the children’s song The Green Grass Grows All Around.That song describes “a wing on a bird in a nest on a branch on a tree in a hole in the ground.” If it helps, you can think of the document syntax in the same way.  The  window.parent.frameOutput.document syntax is very ugly and difficult to work with. I copied the whole mess over to a variable called  theDoc so I wouldn’t have to worry about typing that long reference correctly anymore.  Once I have a reference to the output document, I can invoke its methods to manipu- late it. The call to theDoc.open   clears out any existing contents in the document and prepares the document for new text.  theDoc.write theCode  simply writes the con- tents of theCode to the page. Finally, the call to theDoc.close   signals the browser that the page is complete and that the browser can begin rendering the document.  You cannot count on any document.write   output being visible to the user until you have closed the document. Don’t forget to close the document with the close   method. This method is the equivalent of the signal sent to the browser that tells it that the document is done loading. If you don’t close the document, there is no guar- antee that all the elements will be shown in the right places, or at all.  All it takes to write output to another frame is some careful planning. Just set up the frameset, making sure to name any frames that will contain output. Then, build a function that assembles a Web page in a string variable. Make a reference to the frame, then open the frame, write to it, and close it.  T R A P  T R I C K  If  you  simply  want  to  load  a  page  into  a  frame,  set  a  value  to  the  document’s location.href property. For example, the following line of code would launch my main page in the frameOutput frame from a function:  theDoc.location.href = "http:  www.cs.iupui.edu ~aharris"  This technique can be useful when the page that you need is already complete and available on the Web. You might use the technique to create a Help screen or to load different parts of a complex program onto the main frame of your page.   122  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Displaying Output in Separate Windows Although it is nice to be able to write HTML code into another frame, you might instead wish to have another window pop up altogether. This can be done easily in JavaScript.  Showing an Existing Page You can easily create a new window to display an existing page. This is exactly how I implemented the Help screen in the Petals around the Rose game. The help screen is simply an HTML page. Figures 6.7 and 6.8 show the Show Help program, which pops up that page into a new window.  The ability to pop up a page like this can be very useful, because it displays output without disturbing the current page layout.  H I N T  The HTML code for the Show Help program is quite predictable  it consists of a button that calls the showHelp   function . You may want to look at this program on the CD-ROM.  Here is the code for the showHelp   function:       demonstrates opening an HTML page in a new window    var winHelp = window.open "petalHelp.html",        "pHelp", "width=450,height=450,resizable" ;     function showHelp  {       Show Help       Andy Harris    winHelp.focus  ;  }    end showHelp     The  code  is  very  short,  but  very  powerful.  The  first  line  generates  a  variable  called winHelp. It invokes the  window.open   method, which simply opens a new window. The method takes three parameters. The first is the name of the file to load. The sec- ond parameter is the HTML name for this document. You would use the HTML name if you had HTML hyperlinks to the document in the new window.  Generally you will not have such hyperlinks, but you will need to specify a value for this parameter anyway.  The last parameter is a list of features for the new window. Table 6.1 lists the most important features that you might want to use.  H I N T  This table includes only attributes that are common to both of the major browsers, Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. A few more attributes are avail- able that work in only one browser or the other, but those listed in Table 6.1 should serve most of your purposes.   123  C h a p t e r 6     P e t a l s a r o u n d   t h e R o s e  :    D y n a m i c O u t p u t     FIGURE 6.7  The Show Help program is just a page with a button.  FIGURE 6.8  The user asks for help by clicking the button, and a page appears.  To determine the features of your new window, create a string that contains a list of the features that you want, separated by commas. For example, if you want a 300×300 window with no menus or toolbars, you would use this string:  height=300,width=300  To add the standard toolbar, you would instead use this string:  height=300,width=300,toolbar   124  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  TABLE 6.1 COMMON ATTRIBUTES OF THE FEATURE PARAMETER  Attribute  height  width  location  menubar  resizable  scrollbars  status  Description How high the window will be. How wide the new window will be. Whether the location toolbar will be shown. Whether the menubar will be shown. Whether the user will be able to resize the window. Whether scrollbars will be present  if needed . Whether the status bar will be present. Whether the standard toolbar will be present.  toolbar directories Whether a directory toolbar will be present.  Example  height=200  width=200  location  menubar  resizable  scrollbars  status  toolbar  directories  IN THE REAL WORLD  You might think that a page with no  toolbars  is  kind  of  useless, but it is actually a very common device. When you don’t include menus  or  toolbars,  the  user doesn’t  know  that  the  page  is actually  another  browser  win- dow. Instead, the user gets the impression  that  your  program popped  up  a  window.  Often, this  is  exactly  the  impression that you want to give the user. Of  course,  the  page  that  you pop up can contain any HTML and  JavaScript  elements  that you want.  Note that there are no spaces between values. Also note that only those elements that you include in the list will be added. If you do not specify a fea- ture string, the new window will have exactly the same  features  as  the  window  that  contains  the JavaScript code.  There’s one more line of code in the function:  winHelp.focus  ;  This line tells the new window to seek the focus as if the user has clicked it. The first time that a win- dow is created, it automatically has the focus; how- ever, the user might call the Help screen and then pull  the  main  program  to  the  foreground,  thus obscuring  the  Help  screen.  Without  the  focus   command, the next time that the user clicks the Show Help button, the page will be updated, but it will remain in the background. The focus   com- mand ensures that the Help window is brought to the forefront.  Building the Window Tester Program You can combine the page-writing features of the HTML tester with the ability to open a  new  window.  Figures  6.9  and  6.10  show  another  version  of  the  HTML  tester.  This version creates a new window to which the browser writes the Web page.   125  C h a p t e r 6     P e t a l s a r o u n d   t h e R o s e  :    D y n a m i c O u t p u t     FIGURE 6.9  This program looks just like the Frame Tester, but it does  not have any frames.  FIGURE 6.10  When the user clicks the Show Page button, the  HTML is printed to a  new window.  The program’s code is mainly just a combination of the Frame Tester and the Show Help programs. It involves only one file. Here’s the HTML code of that document:         Window Tester       <textArea name = txtInput            rows = 10            cols = 30>   126         practice       practice page                  <input type = "button"         value = "show page"         onClick = "buildPage  ">  <input type = "button"         value = "close window"         onClick = "closePage  ">              i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  var theWindow;  function buildPage  {       Window Tester       Andy Harris    theDoc.open  ;    theDoc.write theCode ;    theDoc.close  ;    theWindow.focus  ;  }    end buildPage  function closePage  {    theWindow.close  ;  }    end function  As you can see, this HTML code is just like that of the code page of the Frame Tester program.  I added a Close Window button, but otherwise this HTML is much like the Frame Tester page. The JavaScript code is also similar to that in the Frame Tester, but it includes some new instructions for making a window.       Demonstrates how to write HTML to a new window    theWindow = window.open "", "practice", "height=300,width=300" ;    var theCode = document.myForm.txtInput.value;    var theDoc = theWindow.document;   127  C h a p t e r 6     P e t a l s a r o u n d   t h e R o s e  :    D y n a m i c O u t p u t     This code has a few features that you haven’t seen yet in this book. For the first time, more than one function is defined in the page. You can in fact define as many functions as you want. In this case, I made a different function for each button. Doing so is a reasonably common practice. Notice also that I defined one of the variables outside of either function. This is because both of the functions need access to the variable that refers to the new window. I’ll talk a little more about how variables and multiple func- tions are related shortly. For now, make sure that you understand the rest of the code.  Opening a New Window The buildPage   function is much like the buildPage   function in the Frame Tester program. Notice that there are two different calls to the open   method. The first opens up a new window by invoking the open   method of the window object.  theWindow = window.open "", "practice", "height=300,width=300" ;  The second call opens the document for writing.  theDoc.open  ;  The window object and the document object both have open   methods, but the meaning of the term open is different.  After opening the document, I wrote the HTML code to it, closed it, then set the focus to the new win- dow. Note that I closed the document, which tells the browser that the document has finished load- ing and can be rendered.  Closing a Window The user triggers the closePage   function by click- ing the Close button. The function is simple once you  understand  polymorphism.  It  invokes  the c l o s e       method  of  the  window  created  by buildPage  . The close   method of a window ob- ject makes the window disappear.  Designing the Petals around the Rose Game The Petals around the Rose game that you saw at the beginning of the chapter uses the techniques of this chapter to make a much more impressive front end for the dice games that you started mak- ing in Chapter 2. In addition, it is the first program in the book that takes advantage of graphics.  IN THE REAL WORLD  It might seem disconcerting that window.open   is  different from document.open  .  It  is completely  legal  for  different kinds of objects to have meth- ods with the same name as well as similar but not identical be- havior. This demonstrates a con- cept of object-oriented program- ming called polymorphism.  Polymorphism can be defined in a couple of ways, but, basically, it means that objects can adapt the way that they perform cer- tain functions.  While the term openis reason- ably  universal,  the  way  that different  objects  invoke  the method may be different. Think about  how  you  would  open  a garage  door,  a  treasure  chest, and  a  birthday  present.  You open  all  these  objects,  but  the details of opening are different in each case.   128  T R A P  If you haven’t played the Petals around the Rose game yet, you should do so before reading the rest of this chapter. The next section will reveal the secret of the game, which might spoil your fun. Try the game out first, then come back and read about how it was made.  Understanding the Overall Design Strategy Here’s the spoiler for the Petals around the Rose game: The center dot of the die is the rose, and any dots around it are petals. So, only the values 1, 3, and 5 have a rose. The value 1 has no petals, 3 has two petals, and 5 has four petals. The program determines the number of petals around the rose by counting how many total petals are around the  rose  in  the  currently  visible  set  of  dice.  If  this  description  doesn’t  clarify  the program’s scheme, try running the game for a little while and you will understand.  The game is all housed inside a frameset, in a page called petalMas.html. It divides the main page into two sections. The top section has the user interface, with a text box and a  couple  of  buttons.  This  page  contains  all  the  JavaScript  code.  The  bottom  of  the frameset shows five dice  and the winning screen . Usually, the code in the top frame generates the HTML code in the bottom frame. The bottom frame does not contain any code. The program also features a Help screen, which is implemented as a new browser window. Here is the HTML for the frameset  petalMas.html :  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i        <frameset rows = "30%, 70%"            border = 0>         <frame src = "begin.html"           name = "output">                  Petals around the rose       How many petals around the rose?  <input type = "text"         name = "txtGuess">  <input type = "button"  The  top  frame  contains  petals.html,  which  has  all  the  JavaScript  code.  The  bottom frame is called output. It will usually contain very simple HTML, with   tags for five dice.  The HTML code in the top frame sets up the user interface. The code is as follows:   129  C h a p t e r 6     P e t a l s a r o u n d   t h e R o s e  :    D y n a m i c O u t p u t            value = "OK"         onClick = "rollEm  ">  <input type = "button"         value = "help"         onClick = "helpScreen  ">           As you can see, the form is very basic, with a text box and two buttons. Each button calls a different function.  Creating Graphics for JavaScript Games The most obvious new feature in the Petals around the Rose game is the addition of graphics. Images add tremendously to the feel of a program. By learning a few tricks, you can add really great graphics to your games even if you aren’t a terrific artist.  You can add images in a couple of ways. First, you can use images that somebody else has generated. There are numerous archives of images on the Web that depict nearly anything that you might want in a game. It is very easy to use any image you can see on the Web. Simply right-click on the image  or, if you are using a Macintosh, click and hold down on the image ; a menu then pops up. One of the options allows you to save the image locally.  However, just because you can use an image easily doesn’t mean that you should do so. Many images available on the Web are the intellectual property of  somebody,  and  might  be  copyrighted  material. Now that you are producing intellectual property of your own, you should be especially sensitive to the rights of other authors. You should get permission from the original author of any kind of work before you use it in your own projects.  You  can  also  buy  the  services  of  a  professional artist. For commercial-quality games, this may be required.  You  can  get  very  good  results  from  a professional artist, but they will be expensive  IN THE REAL WORLD  Although image manipulation is especially important in game pro- gramming, the ability to include corporate logos, product images, or  other  graphical  information can be an important asset to your Web site.  Finally, you can generate graphics on your own. Although I have an art disability, I have found this to be the best option for a number of reasons. First, because you are the images’ creator, you will have no problem obtaining permission for them. Second, modern image-creation programs do a lot to help you make at least passable graphics. Third, the specific needs of game art are a little different from those of other kinds of programs, and nobody will know the requirements of your game better than you.  Even if I hire a professional artist to create images for me, I still usually design some crude mock-ups of my own, just to illustrate what I want the artist to accomplish.   130  Making the Dice Figure 6.11 shows the tools that I book’s used to build the dice.  I used The GIMP  included on the CD-ROM  as my main image-editing tool. It is not in a final release, but it is free and exceptionally powerful, so I don’t mind the fact that it crashes once in a while. I started by making a rectangle. I then inserted a texture onto the background of the rectangle. Using a special tool called the bump map filter, I then generated the three-dimensional effect.  H I N T  A bump map is a gray-scale image. When you apply the bump map to another image, all the dark areas are interpreted as concave, and the white areas are left alone. The graphics editor then applies a shading effect. The effect is a very realistic- looking texture. I actually applied two bump maps to the die images, using one to round off the die’s edges and the other to create the depressions for the dots.  Of course, you can just paint the dots if you prefer. Notice that I drew all the dots first. I saved this file, and then erased dots as needed to get each particular face of the die.  Finally, I saved the images as die1 through die6. You need to save your image files in a jpeg or gif format. In general, a photorealistic image works better as a jpeg, and an image created from scratch  or one that requires transparency  is better as a gif file. For this particular set of images, it doesn’t matter too much which format you choose. It is im- portant to make your image files as compact as possible, because they will all have to be downloaded. If the downloading takes too long, the user will never play your game.  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 6.11  Using The GIMP, I create a master die.   Making the Cartoon Figures Although the dice are very nice, what really gives this game its tone is the cartoon figure. The figure shows up originally in the Help screen and when the player wins. Caricatures such as this are terrific for games for a number of reasons. First, they are reasonably  easy  to  learn  how  to  draw.  Also,  they  are  very  forgiving.  The  image  is  a cartoon, so nobody expects it to be perfect. My base image looks like Figure 6.12.  The guy in the drawing is a very straightforward cartoon. I stuck with a set of features I knew I could replicate: tall skinny head, short hair, goofy smile, and bushy eyebrows.  Any resemblance to a certain programming author is purely coincidental.   I drew the image in black on a transparent background. This made the image easier to draw, because no shading was involved. Also, the transparent background makes it easy to reuse the image in other programs. Finally, an image with a transparent back- ground integrates easily into your page.  If you know how to use layering tools in your graphics editor, you can put each feature  eyes, mouth, nose, and so on  in another layer so that it is reasonably easy to modify one  feature  without  changing  the  rest.  This  gives  you  an  easy  way  to  generate,  for example, a frowning version of the figure when the player loses.  I concentrated on the head but deliberately gave myself room on one side of the image for a hand. I then saved this image in the gif format, because the gif format supports a transparent background.  For the Petals around the Rose program, I decided not to use the original image at all, but instead made two variants. The first is the guy holding a rose, as shown in Figure 6.13. I use this image in the Help screen.  131  C h a p t e r 6     P e t a l s a r o u n d   t h e R o s e  :    D y n a m i c O u t p u t     FIGURE 6.12  This is the basic  form of the  cartoon image.   132  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 6.13  The Help screen shows the man holding a rose.  FIGURE 6.14  The winning screen shows the man with a rose in his mouth.  For the winning screen, I decided to go for sort of a tango flavor and put the rose in the guy’s mouth, as shown in Figure 6.14.  As  you  can  see,  a  little  imagination  and  some  clever  use  of  the  tools  in  a  graphics editor can amplify even poor drawing skills enough to achieve very usable images.   Generating the Dice-Rolling Routine The functions in petals.html do all the real work. One function is called rollEm  . It is activated every time that the user clicks the OK button. The pseudocode for the rollEm   function is as follows:  get the user's guess from the text area  If the user was correct,    Send the "winner" screen to the output variable  If the user was incorrect,    Tell the correct answer in a dialog box    Clear the output frame    Do this five times:      Get a random value between 1 and 6      Add the appropriate graphic to the output variable    End of the loop  End If  T R I C K  Write out the output variable to the bottom frame  This kind of plan is called pseudocode. The number one mistake that beginning  and advanced  programmers make is to write code without a plan. Now that your pro- grams are starting to get longer, they are going to be harder to keep track of. You should write out in English the basic steps in your program before you even open your  editor.  Once  you  have  a  list  of  steps,  it’s  reasonably  easy  to  convert  the pseudocode into actual JavaScript code. It is a really great habit to write out your steps as I have done here. It can prevent those moments when you are staring at a blank screen, trying to figure out what to do next.  Checking User Input The first task of the rollEm   function is to get the user’s guess. I do this with a text box. Here’s the code for the first part of the function:  var numPetals = 12;   stores the correct answer  133  C h a p t e r 6     P e t a l s a r o u n d   t h e R o s e  :    D y n a m i c O u t p u t     function rollEm  {       Petals around the rose       Andy Harris       An adaptation of an old dice game       requires that a document named "output" is available    var theSource = "";    var roll = 0;    var guess = 999;   stores the user's guess      check user's guess    guess = eval document.myForm.txtGuess.value ;   This program declares one variable outside any function. The variable numPetals con- tains the current correct number of petals. The starting value of numPetals is set to 12, because the default page in the bottom frame has the answer 12. Whenever a new set of dice is generated, the program changes the value of numPetals appropriately. The numPetals variable is declared outside the function because the program needs to pre- serve its value even when the function is not running. Remember that any variables declared  inside  a  function  do  not  preserve  their  values  when  the  function  has  fin- ished. The numPetals variable will be defined during one run of the function, and the value is needed the next time that the user clicks the OK button, so this variable needs to be declared outside the function.  The function begins with the normal comments and generates a number of more tra- ditional variables. theSource is a string variable that will contain the source code of the output frame. I find it easier to compile an HTML page into a long string, then write that string to the page in one command. theSource is the string variable that contains that page.  The variable  roll is an integer that contains the current randomly generated die roll. One more variable, guess, is used to hold the user’s guess. Notice that I initial- ized guess to 999, which is guaranteed to be incorrect. I did that to ensure that the program  does  not  start  with  the  winner  screen  so  that  the  user  gets  at  least  one chance to guess the answer.  The following line pulls the user’s guess from the text box, evaluates it into a numeric variable, and assigns it to the variable guess:  134  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  guess = eval document.myForm.txtGuess.value ;  Dealing with the Winning Position The program then contains the following if structure:  if  guess == numPetals {      theSource += " ";      theSource += " ";      theSource += " ";      theSource += " YOU WIN!!! ";      theSource += " ";      document.myForm.txtGuess.value = "";    } else {        player is incorrect    }    end if  The if statement checks whether the player has guessed correctly. If the user’s guess is  the  same  as  the  previously  stored  value  of  numPetals,  the  function  creates  the HTML for the winning page and stores that HTML code in the theSource variable. The following line resets the text box to blank, to remove whatever value the user last had in the text box:   document.myForm.txtGuess.value = "";   135  C h a p t e r 6     P e t a l s a r o u n d   t h e R o s e  :    D y n a m i c O u t p u t     Generating the Dice Page A bit more work is involved if the user’s guess was incorrect, because the program will have to generate a new puzzle. Fortunately, most of this process should be familiar to you, since it uses a number of techniques from Chapter 2. Here is the code:      alert "there are " + numPetals + " petals around the rose." ;  if  guess == numPetals {       user got it correct    } else {      numPetals = 0;      document.myForm.txtGuess.value = "";      theSource += " ";      theSource += " ";      theSource += " ";      theSource += "    ";      for  i = 1; i <= 5; i++ {        roll = Math.floor Math.random   * 6  + 1;        switch  roll {          case 1:            theSource += "  ";            theSource += "  ";            break;          case 2:            break;          case 3:            break;          case 4:            break;          case 5:            theSource += "  ";            numPetals += 2;            theSource += "  ";            theSource += "  ";            theSource += "  ";            numPetals += 4;            break;          case 6:            theSource += "ERROR!!";            break;          default :        }    end switch      }    end loop    }    end if   136  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  If the user did not guess correctly, the first order of business is to inform the user what the correct answer was. I decided to use an alert statement, because that would hold the rest of the code’s processing until the user clicked the button. This means that the user can still see the last puzzle while looking at the correct answer. As soon as the user clicks the OK button in the alert box, the program puts the new set of images in the output frame.  I then reset the value of numPetals to 0, because the program will determine the ap- propriate  value  of  the  variable  as  it  generates  the  screen.  Next I generate a for loop, because I want five die on the screen. The procedure for generating each is identical. I use the algorithm from Chapter 2 for generating a num- ber from 1 to 6, and then use a switch structure to add the appropriate image to the page. Take a careful look at the code for case 3 and case 5. These are the only dice that have  “petals  around  the  rose,”  so  whenever  a  3  is  generated,  I  add  2  to  numPetals. Whenever a 5 is generated, I add 4 to  numPetals. I put a default case in the  switch structure, even though it should never occur.  T R A P  I designed my algorithm so the only possible values should be 1 to 6, but it is pos- sible that there is a mistake in my algorithm that will occur in very rare cases  What if the Math.random turns out to be exactly 0? .  Finally, I added code to close up the HTML page when the loop is finished, then wrote the value of theSource to the output frame.  Making the Online Help The Online Help is simply a Web page that I already made. To make it appear, I use the same code as in the Show Help program from earlier in this chapter. Here’s the version in the Petals around the Rose program:  function helpScreen  {      pop up a new window with a help screen in it      requires petalHelp.html    var helpWindow = window.open "petalHelp.html", "pHelp",        "height=450,width=450" ;    helpWindow.focus  ;  }    end helpScreen  The  function  generates  a  new  pop-up  window,  then  sets  the  focus  to  that  window. Nothing else is necessary.  Table 6.2 provides you with an easy reference for the new syntax used in this chapter.   TABLE 6.2 SYNTAX SUMMARY  Object.property  window.parent.  framename.document  document.open    document.close    Example  window.parent.frameOutput.  document.write   "I'm a frame" ;  window.parent.frameOutput.  document.open  ;  window.parent.frameOutput.  document.close  ;  window.open   url, targetName,  properties   myWindow = window.open "",  "goofyWin", "height=400,  width=400,resize" ;  Description Refers to the document object of the frameName frame.

Specifically, you learned how to write to another frame, and how to write to a new browser window that you created through the code. The benefit of external out- put is that you can build an entire Web page as the output of your program, which enables you to incorporate any HTML features into your program’s output. You exam- ined the object-oriented programming concept of polymorphism, and you took a first look at the special characteristics of graphics for JavaScript games. Finally, you got a look at a reasonably complete game and saw many of the features from earlier chap- ters put together to build one program.   E X E R C I S E S  1. Design graphics for the Number Guesser game so that rather than printing words, the program provides the user an up arrow for “too low,” a down arrow for “too high,” and a medal or certificate when the user guesses correctly.  2. Write online help for one of your earlier programs and use a pop-up window to display the  text to the user.  3. Make a graphical version of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. For each round, the computer will guess and display a rock, paper, or scissors symbol, and the user will have to input some value to indicate rock, paper, or scissors. The program should then display the val- ues as graphics and determine a winner for the round. Scissors cut paper; paper covers rock; and rock breaks scissors. Have the game continue indefinitely, with the program keeping track of the number of rounds.  4. Write a program that deals a poker hand. Have it choose five values between 1 and 52, and display a card corresponding to that value. You can use one of the many card deck graphics available on the Web, or you can make your own.  138  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i   C H A P T E R  7  Image Swapping  and Lookup Tables:  The Basketball  Game  In this chapter, you will use two of the  most powerful features of modern pro- gramming. Image swappingis the ability to change images dynamically. You will see how these effects are used in traditional Web design and how you can apply them to game development. You will also learn one way that a computer pro- gram can store and retrieve complex information: lookup tables. The specific skills you will learn in this chapter include:    Using the DOM image object    Changing an image with the .src property    Using the onload, onMouseOver, and onMouseOut  event handlers    Building arrays of variables and Making  two-dimensional arrays   The Project: The Basketball Game Figures 7.1 through 7.3 show the Basketball program. The game enables the user to play a crudely simulated game of basketball. The user controls five players that com- pete against an  unseen  computer-operated opponent.  The interface has very few controls. The user controls the action by clicking the players and the basket. The ball appears to move from one player to the next. A text box at the bottom of the screen displays current information. The game goes to 21 points. As simple as the game seems, it is surprisingly engaging.  140  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 7.1  When the program starts, it shows a Help screen with a Start Game button.

There is one very im- portant exception to this rule. You can use JavaScript to change images on the fly. Figures 7.4 and 7.5 show a program, Simple Image Swap, that demonstrates how you can accomplish this.  FIGURE 7.3  The user clicks on a player to pass, or on the basket to shoot.  FIGURE 7.4  The Simple Image Swap program’s  interface displays a triangle in the larger image, then three other images with buttons below them.   142  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 7.5  When the user clicks a button,  the corresponding image shows up  in the larger image area.      Simple image swap                           <img name = imgDisplay         src = "triangle.gif"         height = 100         width = 100>                <img src = "triangle.gif"             height = 50  The HTML Code The code behind the Simple Image Swap program is especially interesting, because it illustrates three different ways that you can manipulate images through JavaScript. As usual, you start with the HTML code:   143  C h a p t e r 7  I        i  m a g e S w a p p n g a n d   L o o k u p   T a b l e s     :   T h e B a s k e t b a l l    G a m e             width = 50             name = "imgTriangle">          <img src = "circle.gif"             height = 50             width = 50             name = "imgCircle">          <img src = "square.gif"             height = 50             width = 50             name = "imgSquare">     <input type = "button"               value = "triangle"               onClick = "showTriangle  ">     <input type = "button"               value = "circle"               onClick = "showCircle  ">     <input type = "button"               value = "square"               onClick = "showSquare  ">                                        The page is a basic form with one button on it. The interface displays one large image and several smaller ones. Note that each image has a name associated with it. Each of the smaller images has a button underneath it. The onClick event of each button calls a different function. As you will see, each of these functions uses a different technique to display the image. I’ll show you the functions one at a time, so you can see how they work.   i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  144  The Triangle Technique The code for the showTriangle   function is as follows:  function showTriangle  {  }    end showTriangle    window.document.imgDisplay.src = "triangle.gif";  The code here is simplicity itself. Images are objects in the document object model. They live right below the document. An image can be referred to as document.imageName and have an src property, which can be read from and written to. If you assign a new URL to the src property, the effect is to change the image on the page.  T R A P  The size of the image on the screen can be something of a problem. If you expect to change a particular image through JavaScript code, be sure that the HTML image tag has height and width properties set. In fact, adding these properties to any HTML image is a very good idea anyway, as it prevents a number of unpleasant surprises.  The Circle Technique The code for the circle function is slightly different.  Here’s how it is written:  function showCircle  {    window.document.theForm.imgDisplay.src =    window.document.theForm.imgCircle.src;  }    end showCircle  The code here is similar to the code in the previous function. There is one significant difference: Instead of assigning a URL to the src property of imgDisplay, the function copies the source property of imgDisplay from the source property of the circle image. This particular approach is used to copy an image from one image on the screen to another. This technique can be useful if you already have an image on the screen that can be copied.  The Image Object and the Square The showSquare   function relies on a different technique. Essentially, I created a new object to hold an image, and I preset the image variable’s source to be the rectangle image. Here is the code.  var imgObjectSquare = new Image 100,100 ;  imgObjectSquare.src = "square.gif";  function showSquare  {  }    end showSquare    window.document.theForm.imgDisplay.src = imgObjectSquare.src;  First, I created the image object outside any functions, so that it is available to other functions. When you create an image object, you use the new keyword and specify a height and width for the image. After creating an image object, you can refer to its src property as you would for any other image. This technique has one very important   advantage: As you create the image object, it is not displayed on the page. Using this approach, you can preload an image into a variable object and copy the src property whenever you wish.  Using the MouseOver Events Figures  7.6  and  7.7  show  another  version  of  the  Simple  Image  Swap  program.  The MouseOver Image Swap program has a couple of differences from the Simple Image  145  C h a p t e r 7  I        i  m a g e S w a p p n g a n d   L o o k u p   T a b l e s     :   T h e B a s k e t b a l l    G a m e  FIGURE 7.6  The MouseOver  Image Swap  program has no  buttons. Instead, the  main image  changes when the mouse moves over the smaller images.  FIGURE 7.7  When the mouse is not over a particular  element, the program simply leaves the main display area blank.   146  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Swap program. First, the page has no buttons! The main image changes when the user moves the mouse over the smaller figures. When the mouse is not over a particular element, the display reverts to blank.  Creating Images with Event Handlers The lack of buttons is the most obvious new feature, but the code also introduces a number of other improvements. First, take a look at the HTML code. The only part that is different is that which surrounds the smaller images. All the images call exactly the same function, so the key differences are embedded in the HTML code itself. The tri- angle code follows; the code for the other images is all pretty much the same. Of course, you really should look at the actual program on the CD-ROM that accompanies this book.           onMouseOver = show "imgObjTriangle"            onMouseOut = "document.imgDisplay.src = 'blank.gif'">     …        <a href = "dummy"           <img src = "triangle.gif"             height = 50             width = 50             name = "imgTriangle"             border = 0>                A couple of interesting features are apparent in this code. The essential problem is this: You want the main image to change when the mouse moves over the triangle image. It would be great if the image object had some sort of “the mouse is over me” event. Unfortunately, images do not have any events at all. Web authors have devised a clever way to work around this problem. Anchors  created with the   tag  have some event handlers built into them. Here are the key event handlers of the anchor object:  TABLE 7.1 KEY EVENT HANDLERS OF THE ANCHOR OBJECT  Event onClick onDblClick onMouseOver onMouseOut  Description The user clicks the anchor. The user double-clicks the anchor. The mouse moves over the anchor. The mouse moves off of the anchor.   147  C h a p t e r 7  I        i  m a g e S w a p p n g a n d   L o o k u p   T a b l e s     :   T h e B a s k e t b a l l    G a m e  Note that other event handlers are possible, but those listed in the table are the most commonly used, and they are proven to work well in both the major browsers. Use online references to check for the existence of other event handlers.  The other interesting feature of the anchor tag is that it can surround images or text, so if you want to apply an event handler to an image, you can simply surround the image with an anchor tag and apply the events to the anchor.  H I N T  In this particular situation, the URL used in the anchor’s href attribute is irrelevant— you don’t really intend for the user ever to click the anchor, but just to move over it. There are a number of ways to deal with this situation. You can simply point the href attribute back to the file that contains the code. A more elegant solution  the one I used in this code  is to build a named anchor in the current page and link to that anchor. As long as the page all fits on the screen, the user will not notice the jump to the anchor at all.  To  pull  off  the  illusion  well,  you  need  to  make  sure  that  the  anchor  isn’t  obvious. Setting the image’s border to 0 eliminates the blue border that would normally appear when an image serves as a hyperlink. Notice that I added the onMouseOver event han- dler. This calls a function that will change the image. I also added an onMouseOut event handler.  This  second  event  handler  changes  the  display  image’s  source  to  blank  as soon as the mouse exits the triangle image.  IN THE REAL WORLD  Several variations of this technique have become staples in the Web world recently. The most prevalent of these is the MouseOver technique. No doubt you have seen many pages that use the effect: When your mouse goes over a certain part of the screen, the particular word or image  changes  color,  swells,  glows,  or  does  something  similar.  To  achieve  this  effect,  you attach both an onMouseOver and an onMouseOut event to the image. The code might look something like this:  <a href = "http:  www.whatever.com"        onMouseOver = "document.theImage.src = 'glow.gif'"        onMouseOut = "document.theImage.src = 'normal.gif'">        <img src = "normal.gif"                 name = "theImage">     This code displays the glowing image whenever the mouse is over the anchor object. As soon as the mouse exits the image and anchor, the onmouseOut event triggers the image to revert to its default value. Note the nested single and double quotation marks.   Writing JavaScript to Change the Images Now that you know how to set up an image with an event handler, you need to look at the code that will call it.  Here’s the JavaScript code for the imgOver page:  148  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i       create the image objects  var imgObjSquare = new Image 100,100 ;  var imgObjTriangle = new Image 100,100 ;  var imgObjCircle = new Image 100,100 ;    initialize the image objects  imgObjSquare.src = "square.gif"  imgObjCircle.src = "circle.gif"  imgObjTriangle.src = "triangle.gif"  function show imgToShow {      receives image as a parameter      copy the value to the display image    document.imgDisplay.src = imgToShow.src;  }    end show     Before starting the function, I created a series of image objects and initialized them. The function code will refer to these image objects.  Using Parameters with Functions It would have been reasonably easy to make a separate function for each image. The code would be almost identical in every function, except that it would replace the display image with a different value. Although it would be easy to build these func- tions with the copy and paste features of your editor, experienced programmers often try to find ways to avoid such code repetition. Imagine if you had written the code five  or 500  times and then discovered that there was a problem. You would then have to make five  or 500  changes. There is a better way.  The show   function is a little unique, because it contains a parameter. In most of the programs in this book, you created functions with empty parentheses. The parameter allows you to create a function that can work with a special value. By changing the value sent to a function, you can make it operate on a number of different things. You’ve already seen this many times in your programming career. Think about the alert   function. It always pops up a message box with a message in it, but the value in the parentheses determines the specific message. To specify a function that will work with a parameter, just write a variable name in the parentheses when you define the function. Then, when you call the function, specify a value. When the function is running, the parameter variable will be automatically created, and it will contain the value specified by the function call.   Here’s how parameters are used in the show   function: The function will always be used to copy the src property of an image object to the imgDisplay picture. The prob- lem is that the specific image to be copied will differ based on which of the smaller images the mouse passed over. The onMouseOver events each specify the name of the object to be displayed. When the user passes the mouse over the triangle image, for example,  its  onMouseOver  event  triggers  the  show    function  with  the  value imgObjTriangle  sent  as  a  parameter.  Likewise,  the  square  image  code  sends  the imgObjSquare, and so on. When the show   function runs, whatever value was sent in the parentheses is stored in the variable imgToShow. The src property of whatever image object that the imgToShow variable contains is copied over to display the im- age. Function parameters are often used to make a function more flexible, as I have done in this example.  Creating Simple Arrays The programs that you are writing are becoming more complex, and they are begin- ning to have a large number of variables. To make the variables more manageable, programmers tend to use structures such as arrays. You might recall arrays from Chap- ter 5, “Advanced Mad Lib: Using the Other Form Elements”. In that chapter, you simply built a series of HTML components with the same name, and they automatically be- came an array. You can also make arrays out of any type of JavaScript variable. Figures 7.8 and 7.9 show a simple program, Simple Array Demo, that features an array of strings.  The program switches from blank to triangle, circle, square, and back to blank when the user clicks the button. In a moment, you’ll add matching images, but for now, just concentrate on the structure that will give you the captions in sequence.  149  C h a p t e r 7  I        i  m a g e S w a p p n g a n d   L o o k u p   T a b l e s     :   T h e B a s k e t b a l l    G a m e  FIGURE 7.8  The Simple Array Demo program  starts with the word “blank” visible in a  text box.   150  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 7.9  As the user clicks the button, the text box changes values  in a set pattern.  The HTML consists of one text area, named txtDescription, and one button, which calls the upDate   function when clicked. Here’s the JavaScript for the program:  var description = new Array 3   var counter = 0;  function initialize  {       sets up the array with some starting values       Andy Harris    description[0] = "blank";    description[1] = "triangle";    description[2] = "circle";    description[3] = "square";  }    end initialize      increments the counter and shows the next description  function upDate  {    counter++;    if  counter > 3 {      counter = 0;    }    end if  }    end upDate    document.myForm.txtDescription.value = description[counter];   151  C h a p t e r 7  I        i  m a g e S w a p p n g a n d   L o o k u p   T a b l e s     :   T h e B a s k e t b a l l    G a m e  Creating a Variable Array The first line of code creates a variable called description:  var description = new Array 3   This is a very special type of variable, because it houses an array. To make an array, you use the new Array   syntax. The value inside the parentheses indicates the number of elements in the array. JavaScript does not actually require the number, so the follow- ing line would work just as well:  var description = new Array    Still, most languages require the programmer to state the number of elements in an array when it is created, so it is traditional to do so even in a more lenient language such as JavaScript.  Don’t forget to capitalize the term Array! This is a very easy mistake to make, and it can be very difficult to debug.  Populating the Array Once an array is created, it is essentially a list of variables. Somehow, you will need to fill up the array with values. In this program, I chose to use a special function called initialize  . The function contains a series of assignment statements that fill up all the array elements with the appropriate values. JavaScript arrays are extremely flex- ible. You can mix and match variable types in the same array, and you can even add more elements than you specified when creating the array.  Be aware that JavaScript’s cavalier attitude toward arrays is not typical. Most other languages are much pickier about how arrays are defined. It’s fine to take advantage of the lax rules in JavaScript, but don’t be surprised when you find that the habits you learned in JavaScript array creation are seen as a bit sloppy in some other language.  T R A P  T R A P  The  initialize   method needs to occur early. I chose to attach it to a special event handler to force the initialize   function to occur as soon as the page is loaded. The HTML body tag has an onLoad event. Any function in the  onLoad event will execute as soon as the browser loads the body. Therefore, this function is a perfect place for initialization code. Although  I  did  not  show  you  the  HTML  code  for this program, here is the relevant line:     IN THE REAL WORLD  In any kind of program that re- quires  some  code  to  execute before the user gets control of the  environment,  you  might want  to  consider  this  kind  of initialize   function.  Such a function is useful any time you want to set up variables, initial- ize form values, or get some kind of  initial  information  from  the system  such as the current time or the user’s domain name .   152  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Showing the Next Element The button calls the upDate   function. The job of this function is to show the next array element. To do this, the function keeps track of a variable called  counter. Note that counter is created outside any functions, because the program must retain the variable’s value through multiple function calls. Each time that the user clicks the Next button, the program increments counter. Then the program checks whether the value of counter has gotten too large. If it has, the program resets  counter to 0. Finally, the program updates the text box with the member of the array related to the counter variable.  H I N T  Any time that you increment or decrement a variable, you should consider using some kind of boundary checking to make sure that the variable does not get too large or too small. You should follow most increment or decrement operations with some kind of  if statement checking for a boundary, and take action if the value exceeds that boundary.  Creating Arrays with Images JavaScript supports arrays of anything that can be placed in variables, even images. Figures 7.10 and 7.11 show an improved version of the array program called the Image Array Demo. This version supports graphics.  This program sports two arrays. One array contains all the descriptions, and the other contains all the images. I carefully designed the arrays to be in exactly in the same order, so that image[1] refers to the same thing as description[1].  FIGURE 7.10  When the  description in the  text field is  “triangle,” a triangle  image appears.   153  C h a p t e r 7  I        i  m a g e S w a p p n g a n d   L o o k u p   T a b l e s     :   T h e B a s k e t b a l l    G a m e  Writing the HTML Code for the Image Array Demo Program The HTML for this version of the array program is reasonably straightforward:  FIGURE 7.11  The Image Array Demo program synchronizes the circle image with  the circle  description in the  text box.         Image Array Demo       <img src = "blank.gif"       name = "imgDisplay"       height = 100       width = 100>     <input type = "text"         name = "txtDescription"         value = "blank">     <input type = "button"         value = "next"         onClick = "upDate  ">               154  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  The  most  significant  features  are  the  initialization  function  in  the  body  onLoad   method and the image object called imgDisplay.  Creating and Initializing the Arrays The Image Array Demo program contains an array of strings and an array of images. The code initializes the two array types differently. Take a look at this code:  var description = new Array "blank", "triangle", "circle", "square" ;  var pictures = new Array 3 ;  var counter = 0;  function initialize  {       sets up the array with some starting values       Andy Harris    pictures[0] = new Image 50, 50 ;    pictures[0].src = "blank.gif";    pictures[1] = new Image 50, 50 ;    pictures[1].src = "triangle.gif";    pictures[2] = new Image 50, 50 ;    pictures[2].src = "circle.gif";    pictures[3] = new Image 50, 50 ;    pictures[3].src = "square.gif";  }    end initialize  The counter variable is created as you would expect, and the pictures array creation looks much like you would guess, but the  description array is a little bit different. JavaScript allows you to define arrays on the fly in certain circumstances. Since I al- ready know the values that I want in the description array, I simply list them in the array creation statement, and the array is automatically built for me.  Sadly, image objects require a bit more work, because I need to create the image object and then assign a value to its source property. For the picture array, I decided to use the standard initialization function.  Updating the Page The upDate   function is very similar to that in the Simple Array Demo program, but I added one line to update the image. Here’s the entire function:      increments the counter and shows the next description  function upDate  {    counter++;    if  counter > 3 {      counter = 0;    }    end if  }    end upDate    document.imgDisplay.src = pictures[counter].src;    document.myForm.txtDescription.value = description[counter];   The only new line is the one that refers to imgDisplay.  Here’s what that line means: Take the member of the pictures array referred to by counter. Grab the source property of that image and copy it to the source property of imgDisplay. This has the net effect of changing imgDisplay so that it shows the current image.  Using Lookup Tables Arrays can be exceptionally useful when you have large amounts of data to manage. As an example, think back to the Basketball program featured at the beginning of this chapter. To illustrate how arrays can be useful, I started with a simpler program, Lookup Table Demonstration, that determines the likelihood that a given player will succeed with a shot or a pass to another player.  Creating the Basketball Lookup Table Demonstration Program Figures 7.12 and 7.13 show the Lookup Table Demonstration program. The drop-down lists  enable  the  user  to  choose  a  shooter   the  player  who  is  passing  the  ball   and  a target  either the basket or the player to whom the user is passing the ball . Then, when the user clicks the Throw It button, the text screen analyzes the likelihood  ex- pressed as a percentage  that the play will succeed.  H I N T  When you are writing complex programs, it is often a great idea to isolate new ideas into smaller test programs, so that you can ensure that each of the main concepts works in isolation before you piece all the tested concepts together in potentially more complex ways.  You’ll see the code for the lookup program in a moment, but it is important to under- stand the underlying concepts first.  155  C h a p t e r 7  I        i  m a g e S w a p p n g a n d   L o o k u p   T a b l e s     :   T h e B a s k e t b a l l    G a m e  FIGURE 7.12  The user can  choose a shooter  and receiver.   156  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 7.13  The Lookup Table Demonstration  program calculates how likely it is that  the pass will  succeed.  Encoding One Player’s Percentages Imagine that the in-bounder has the ball. This player can choose to pass to each of the other four players on the team, and can even attempt to score by directing a shot at the basket  at least in the very simplified form of basketball that I modeled in my game . It is very likely that the in-bounder will succeed in a pass to the nearest player. It is much less likely that the player could make a basket from the other end of the court. You could summarize the likelihood  expressed in a percentage  of each of this player’s options in a chart such as the following: Center .05  Player In-bounder  Forward .10  Basket .01  Guard .90  3-Pt .30  This table describes the likelihood of the in-bounder passing a ball to each of the other players. In other words, I am suggesting that there is a 1%  .01  chance that the in bounder would successfully complete a basket. The same player would have a 5% chance of completing a pass to the center, a 10% chance of passing successfully to the forward, a 30% chance of a successful pass to the 3-point shooter  maybe a shooting guard stand- ing outside the three-point arc , and a 90% chance of a successful pass to the guard.  It is good that these values are expressed as percentages, because percentages can be thought of as values between 0  0%  and 1  100 % .  You already know how to get a random number between 0 and 1, so if you want to simulate that a certain pass is successful 30% of the time, all you need to get is a 0-to-1 random number and compare it to .3. The random number will be less than .3 30% of the time and larger than .3 70% of the time.  You can store this information in an array that looks like this:  var INVals = new Array .01, .05, .10, .30, .90 ;   Then, if you want to see whether the in-bounder succeeded in passing to the center, you could use code like this:  157  C h a p t e r 7  I        i  m a g e S w a p p n g a n d   L o o k u p   T a b l e s     :   T h e B a s k e t b a l l    G a m e    inbounder passes to center  if  Math.random   < INVals[1] {    alert "pass from inbounder to center succeeded!" ;  }    end if  Adding the Other Players Of course, you have five players on the court, so you need five of these charts to man- age all the possible pass permutations. I made another chart combining my estimates of each player’s chances for each type of pass or shot. My complete chart looks like this:  Player Center Forward 3-Pt Guard In-bdr  Basket .50 .30 .25 .05 .01  Center –1 .60 .50 .40 .05  Forward .70 –1 .70 .50 .10  3-Pt .30 .70 –1 .70 .30  Guard .80 .80 .80 –1 .90  In-bounder .80 .80 .80 .80 –1  Each row represents a shooter, and each column represents a target. A cell in the table designates  the  likelihood,  expressed  as  a  percentage,  that  a  particular  shooter  will succeed with a particular pass or shot attempt. For example, to find out how likely it is that the three-point shooter will successfully pass to the center, find the 3-Pt row, then read across to the Center column. The value that you will find is .50, so this means that there is a 50% chance this particular pass will succeed.  The center has a 50% chance at a basket, whereas the in-bounder has a 1 in 100 chance. I decided that a player should never pass to himself, so I set those values at –1.  H I N T  There is absolutely no scientific method behind the assignment of these values. I sat down and wrote this chart just off the top of my head. It seemed to me that these were reasonable assumptions, and after testing the completed game, they made an inter- esting game. Of course, in a more realistic simulation, you would find ways to get more accurate percentages, perhaps by researching actual basketball statistics.  Coding a Lookup Table This kind of two-dimensional chart is called a lookup table. To make one in JavaScript, you simply create a series of arrays  one per row  and then join these arrays together in a bigger array. A look at the source code should help you understand how this works. The first thing I did was to make a set of variables to represent the players on the court:    define constants for positions  var BK = 0;    basket  var CT = 1;    center  var FD = 2;    forward   158  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  var TP = 3;    three point shooter  var GD = 4;    guard  var IN = 5;    in-bounder  I’ll be making a lot of arrays, and in each array the 0 element represents the basket and the fifth element represents the in-bounder. To make the coding easier to read, I named some of the variables using mnemonics for the positions.  Sometimes, though, I might really want the position names, so my first array will be a list of the actual player names:  var plName = new Array  "basket", "center", "forward", "three point shooter", "guard", "in-bounder" ;  Note that the player names are in order, so plName BK  is “basket.” You can also modify this array so that it contains the actual names of players on your favorite team.  Next, I’ll make a series of arrays that encode the percentages for each player:    define arrays to hold rows  var CTVals = new Array .50, -1, .70, .30, .80, .80 ;  var FDVals = new Array .30, .60, -1, .70, .80, .80 ;  var TPVals = new Array .25, .50, .70, -1, .80, .80 ;  var GDVals = new Array .05, .40, .50, .70, -1, .80 ;  var INVals = new Array .01, .05, .10, .30, .90, -1 ;  Each array specifies one row in my original chart. The order of values in the arrays is very important. If you want to know the likelihood of the guard successfully passing to the center, you could write a code statement such as alert GDVals[CT] ;.  Finally, I combined all the individual player arrays into one larger array.  var allVals = new Array  0, CTVals, FDVals, TPVals, GDVals, INVals ;  Note that the elements in the arrays are other ar- rays. Also note that the 0 value is just a placeholder, because the basket won’t ever shoot. Now all the data about all the players is stored into one big vari- able called allVals. You can determine any value in the table by referring to the allVals array of ar- rays. For example, alert allVals[IN][CT]  would return the likelihood of a pass from the in-bounder to the center. The [IN] value would specify use of the fifth element of allVals  remember, IN is just a shortcut for 5 . Since the fifth element of allVals is another array, you can ask for the [CT]  or first  value of that array.  This type of structure  an array of ar- rays  is a two-dimensional array.  Other languages use other techniques to generate two-dimensional arrays, but most languages support them.  IN THE REAL WORLD  Lookup tables are useful any time you want to deal with some sort of  a  chart  of  information.  You could use such a structure to look up shipping cost information, tax rates,  customer  information,  or nearly  anything  that  could  be written  in  a  two-dimensional table.  In  fact,  lookup  tables  are not  limited  to  two  dimensions. By placing the large arrays into even larger arrays, you can cre- ate lookup tables with three, four, or  even  more  dimensions.   In Chapter 12, “The Game Creation Process:  The  Brick  Game,”  you will see an example of a three- dimensional lookup table.    Getting Values from the Lookup Table It is very easy to use a lookup table once you have defined it. Here’s the  throwIt   function in the Lookup Table Demonstration example:  159  function throwIt  {       Lookup Table Demonstration       Andy Harris        alert "got to throwIt" ;    var scoreboard = document.m+yForm.txtOutput;    var shooter;    var target;    var result;    var rndVal = Math.random  ;      theSelect = document.myForm.selShooter;    shooter = document.myForm.selShooter.selectedIndex;    target = document.myForm.selTarget.selectedIndex;  if  rndVal < allVals[shooter][target] {      result = "Made it!";    } else {      result = "Failed";    }    end if    scoreboard.value = "Shooter: " + shooter + " " + plName[shooter] + "\n";    scoreboard.value += "Target: " + target + " " + plName[target] + "\n";    scoreboard.value += "Percentage: " + allVals[shooter][target] + "\n";    scoreboard.value += "Result: " + rndVal + "\n" + result;  }    end  The function generates variables for the shooter, the target, and a random value. The values for shooter and target are extracted from the two select objects. The follow- ing is the key line:  if  rndVal < allVals[shooter][target] {  It  compares  the  randomly  generated  value  to  the  appropriate  percentage  from  the lookup table. If the condition is true, the function considers the pass or shot complete.  All the rest of the code simply sends information to the text box to clarify what is happening.  C h a p t e r 7  I        i  m a g e S w a p p n g a n d   L o o k u p   T a b l e s     :   T h e B a s k e t b a l l    G a m e   160  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  IN THE REAL WORLD  Beginning programmers are often put off by the notion of arrays and lookup tables. You could in fact write this program without any arrays at all. On my first attempt at this program, I did exactly that. I used a switch statement to figure out who had the ball, and inside that switch statement I placed another switch statement to figure out which player was the target of the pass. Each receiver switch statement took 22 lines of code, and the passer switch statement had five of these receiver structures, plus some of its own overhead. The entire logic structure for determin- ing the percentages required over 130 lines of code, with logic structures sometimes four and five layers deep. Even though I’m a reasonably experienced programmer, I was having a hard time keeping the logic structure straight. Updating the code would have been really difficult, and tweaking the code so that it performed exactly as I wanted would have been nearly impossible. In contrast, the version that uses a lookup table requires a total of 15 lines of code. All the data is in the same place, where it can be easily modified. Sometimes spending a little bit of time up front designing a more elaborate data structure can save you a huge amount of grief down the road.  Putting Together the Basketball Game The Basketball game is simply a combination of the main ideas in this chapter. Its basic core is the lookup table described in the previous section. I added a graphical interface and scorekeeping capabilities to turn the table into a game.  The Game Window The graphical appearance of the game is important, if it is to feel like a basketball simulation. I started by drawing a basketball court with my painting program. This court is intended as a background image, because the other images  the players  are superimposed on top of it.  The tricky thing about background images is the way that they automatically tile. This means that if the basketball court image is smaller than the window, the image will appear more than once. If the background image is too large, the entire court will not be visible. I needed a way to guarantee the size of the browser window, so I decided to make the actual game appear in a secondary window. The screen that the user sees first has only one button. The code for that button pops up a secondary window, which is pre-sized to be the right size for the background graphic and the scoreboard. Be- cause the user cannot resize the new window, the tiling effect of the background im- age will not be a problem. Here’s the code that pops up the game window:  function startGame  {       Basketball       Andy Harris       loads up basketball court in new window    var stadium = window.open "bball.html", "bbAnch", "height=450,width=300" ;    stadium.focus  ;  }    end startGame   161  C h a p t e r 7  I        i  m a g e S w a p p n g a n d   L o o k u p   T a b l e s     :   T h e B a s k e t b a l l    G a m e  Displaying a game in a separate window is a pretty standard technique.  You have no control of the browser’s configuration when the user first comes to your Web page. You can only achieve precise control of a window that you create. By creat- ing a window, you can determine its exact size, and you can ensure that the user can- not resize the screen.  The Graphic Design The basketball court is the background of the main game page. The page also contains figures for the five positions on the court. Getting the images placed on the court correctly is a real challenge using standard HTML techniques. To position these images correctly, I relied on a few tricks of the HTML designer. Figure 7.14 shows the basketball page with some modifications to illustrate how I placed the figures.  Each player is in a table. The tables each have one row containing a blank image and a player image. In Figure 7.14, I changed the blank image to an all-white image, so you could see more clearly how the spacing was done. By changing the size of the spacing image, I gave myself a fair degree of control over the placement of the player. For ex- ample, the height of the white image over the basket ensures that the forward will be completely below the basket. The width of the image to the left of the forward ensures that the forward will be placed to the right of the basket. Of course, the white bars are distracting, so once I got all the players positioned correctly, I replaced the all-white image with a completely transparent gif image.  IN THE REAL WORLD  HTML is a wonderfully expressive language. The HTML author can be reasonably confident that the content of his or her page will be displayed on a wide variety of platforms. The cross- platform flexibility comes at a cost, however. It is very difficult to control exactly how ele- ments are positioned on a page.  In Chapter 8, “Dynamic HTML: The Stealth Submarine,” you will learn about how cascading style sheets  CSS  technology can be used to position ele- ments. For this chapter, though, I will rely on techniques that are used even in the older brows- ers that do not support CSS elements.  HTML authors discovered that tables were a very nice way to position elements onscreen. Many of the forms in this book have been created with tables. It is theoretically possible to exactly determine the height and width of a table cell in pixels. It would seem that this would give  the  HTML  author  a  terrific  way  to  place  things  more  precisely  on  the  screen,  but  the browsers are notoriously inconsistent in their support for these table features.  You can also directly determine the size of an image in pixels, and all the major browsers do this very well. HTML authors began using blank images to put blank space in their Web pages. By building a table with blank images in it, you can achieve a surprising amount of control of your screen layout without use of CSS or other advanced techniques.  You will learn several more elegant solutions to positioning HTML elements as you go through the book, but this technique is still useful in some situations.   162  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Here’s the HTML code that shows the placement of the images:  FIGURE 7.14  The images are placed in tables with invisible images as  placeholders.  <body background = court.gif        onLoad = "resetGame  ">                     <img src = "blank.gif"         height = 20         width = 130>    <img src = "blank.gif"         name = "img0"         height = 30         width = 20         border = 0>                   <img src = "player.gif"         name = "imgPlay1"         height = 40         width = 40         border = 0>        163  C h a p t e r 7  I        i  m a g e S w a p p n g a n d   L o o k u p   T a b l e s     :   T h e B a s k e t b a l l    G a m e                             <img src = "blank.gif"         height = 20         width = 180>    <img src = "player.gif"         name = "imgPlay2"         height = 40         width = 40         border = 0>                       This code fragment handles only the first two tables, but shows the technique that I used for all the tables. You can check the CD-ROM for the full source code. Note that I hid the borders of the images and tables so that the graphics would appear to be inte- grated into the page. Note also the use of  JavaScript:throwTo    as the bref of the anchor tags. Any place you can put a url or an href, you can also put “JavaScript:” and a line of JavaScript code. In this case I called the throwto   function. All the images call the same function but send their own ID as a parameter.  H I N T  In later chapters, I will describe some more precise positioning techniques that use positional style sheet elements. It is good also to know the more “old-fashioned” technique used in this example, as the technique is still reliable and useful for cer- tain situations.  The player image is very crude but does the job  see Figure 7.15 . I drew the image at 100×100 resolution with a blank background. I saved versions with and without the basketball.  The Global Variables The lookup table is the key to this program. I started by defining the lookup table exactly as it was in the Lookup Table Demonstration program. I also added a few other variables for scorekeeping:    define main variables  var playerScore;   164  var opScore;  var currentPlayer;    define constants for positions  var BK = 0;    basket  var CT = 1;    center  var FD = 2;    forward  var TP = 3;    three point shooter  var GD = 4;    guard  var IN = 5;    in-bounder  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i    define array for player names  var plName = new Array  "basket", "center", "forward", "three point shooter", "guard", "in-bounder" ;    define arrays to hold rows  var CTVals = new Array .50, -1, .70, .30, .80, .80 ;  var FDVals = new Array .30, .60, -1, .70, .80, .80 ;  var TPVals = new Array .25, .50, .70, -1, .80, .80 ;  var GDVals = new Array .05, .40, .50, .70, -1, .80 ;  var INVals = new Array .01, .05, .10, .30, .90, -1 ;    make an array of arrays  var allVals = new Array  0, CTVals, FDVals, TPVals, GDVals, INVals ;  FIGURE 7.15  Using The GIMP to create the original  player image.   The resetGame   Function The program must initialize all the variables to suitable starting values. The program will also need to execute the exact same code whenever the user wins or loses the game. So, I put all the code for resetting the game into a function, resetGame  . Here’s the code for that function.  function resetGame  {      reset all game variables    playerScore = 0;    opScore = 0;    currentPlayer = IN;    document.myForm.scoreBoard.value = "";    updateScreen currentPlayer ;  }    end resetGame  The code just sets up key variables with the values necessary to start up the game. ScoreBoard is a reference to a text box that displays all information to the user. The function ends with a call to another function, updateScreen.  You’ll see what that function does in just a moment.  The updateScore   Function Another function is meant to be called each time the player or the computer scores a basket.  Here’s how it works:  function updateScore  {    var scoreCard = "";    scoreCard += "Player \tComputer \n";    scoreCard += playerScore;    scoreCard += "\t" + opScore;    document.myForm.scoreBoard.value += scoreCard;      check for win    if  opScore >= 21  {      alert  "You LOST!!!" ;      resetGame  ;    } else if  playerScore >= 21  {      alert  "You WIN!!!" ;      resetGame  ;    }    end if  }    end updateScore  The function builds a string with scoring information. Because this function is called after every score, it’s a great place to check for winning and losing positions.  165  C h a p t e r 7  I        i  m a g e S w a p p n g a n d   L o o k u p   T a b l e s     :   T h e B a s k e t b a l l    G a m e   166  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  The updateScreen   Function The program calls the updateScreen   function every time that the ball is supposed to change hands. The player who is to receive the ball is passed as a parameter to the function. Here is the function’s code:  function updateScreen currentPlayer {      clears all the images,  shows only current player with ball      clear all images    for  i = 1; i <= 5; i++ {     var imgPlayer = eval "document.imgPlay" + i ;     imgPlayer.src = "player.gif"    }    end for loop      show current image    imgPlayer = eval "document.imgPlay" + currentPlayer ;    imgPlayer.src = "ball.gif";    window.status = plName[currentPlayer];  }    end updateScreen  The program puts the player image  with no ball  in every position, then puts the ball image in the position specified by the currentPlayer parameter. Notice the use of the eval statement. The images for the players are called imgPlay1, imgPlay2, and so on. I concatenated the string variable document.imgPlay with the variables i  in the loop, this variable will have values between 1 and 5  and currentPlayer. I then used the eval state- ment to force the computer to evaluate the resulting string as a JavaScript statement. The evaluation generates an image object, which I stored to a variable for convenience.  The throwTo   Function Every time the user clicks one of the player images, the program calls the throwTo   function.  This  function’s  job  is  to  determine  whether  the  pass  or  throw  should  be completed. Here’s the code for the function:  function throwTo receiver {    if  Math.random   < allVals[currentPlayer][receiver] {        successful pass or shot        check for score      if  receiver == BK {        document.myForm.scoreBoard.value = "SCORE!!! \n";        playerScore += 2;          look for three pointers!        if  currentPlayer >= TP {          playerScore +=1;        }    end three point if          document.myForm.scoreBoard.value += "It's a three-pointer! \n";   167  C h a p t e r 7  I        i  m a g e S w a p p n g a n d   L o o k u p   T a b l e s     :   T h e B a s k e t b a l l    G a m e        document.myForm.scoreBoard.value = "made the pass to " + plName[receiver] + "\n";        updateScore  ;        currentPlayer = IN;      } else {        currentPlayer = receiver;      }    end score if    } else {        pass or shot did not succeed      currentPlayer++;      if  currentPlayer > IN {        currentPlayer = IN;      }    end opponent scores        opScore += 2;        updateScore  ;        currentPlayer = IN;      }    end if    }    end if    updateScreen currentPlayer ;  }    end throwTo function      document.myForm.scoreBoard.value = "blocked!!";        give opponent a random chance of scoring      if  Math.random   < .20 {        document.myForm.scoreBoard.value += "Opponent scored!! \n";  The function expects a receiver to be sent as a parameter. All the calls to this function include the code variable for whichever player is supposed to receive the ball.  The main order of business is to determine whether the shot succeeded. That is done in the following line of code.  if  Math.random   < allVals[currentPlayer][receiver] {  currentPlayer is a global variable, and it will always contain the code for the player that currently has the ball. The code line makes a reference to the lookup table and retrieves the percentage stored for this combination of passer and receiver. The pro- gram then compares this value to a random value.  If the pass succeeded, the program must check whether the pass was an attempt to score. This is easy to do, because the pass will be a score only if the receiver is the basket. In all other cases, the pass is simply a pass to another player. If an attempt for a basket  succeeds,  the  program  should  increment  the  score  by  two.  One  more  check determines whether the scoring player was behind the three-point line. If so, the pro- gram tacks on another point. Since the score has changed, the program makes a call to upDateScore   so that the user knows the current score.   168  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  TABLE 7.2 SYNTAX SUMMARY  Statement   height, width   varName = new Image  Description Creates a new image object called varName with the specified height and width. Assigns the URL as the source of the given image object. The URL must point to a valid image file. varName = new Array   Creates a new array  imgVar.src = URL  varName = new Array   length   varName = new Array   valA, valB, valC   variable called varName. Creates a new array variable called varName with the specified number of elements. Creates a new array variable called varName preloaded with the values in the parentheses.  Example  var myImage = new  Image 100, 100 ;  myImage.src =  "face.gif";  var myArray =  new Array  ;  var myArray = new  Array 3 ;  var myArray = new  Array "small",  "medium", "large" ;  If the receiver was not the basket, the attempt was a pass. In this case, the program simply  sends  a  message  to  the  scoreboard  indicating  the  pass  and  changes  the currentPlayer variable to reflect the player that currently has the ball.  If the pass or shot failed, the program moves the ball back one position. For example, if the three-point shooter missed a shot, the ball goes to the guard. If the passer was the in- bounder, I chose to let that player keep the ball. Any time a shot or pass is blocked, the opponent has the opportunity to make a score. I chose to give the opponent a 20% chance of scoring. This seems to give balanced game play. The player wins often enough to stay interested, but not every time. The opponent’s likelihood of scoring is the single easiest way to change the difficulty of the game. If you make this number larger, the opponent will score more often. If you make it smaller, the opponent will not score as frequently.  Summary In this chapter, you looked at two very useful concepts. The first concept was that of image swapping. You learned about the JavaScript image object, and how to manipu- late the source property of that object to make new images appear on the screen. You also learned how to add event handlers to an image by surrounding the image with an anchor tag, and you learned how to make your functions more flexible by adding pa- rameters to them.  The other main concept of the chapter was the use of data arrays as lookup tables. You learned how to build basic one-dimensional arrays of normal variables and of image   objects. You wrote code that allows you to step through an array one value at a time, and you learned how to build two-dimensional arrays to encapsulate larger data structures.  You also learned a few graphics tricks to make the Basketball program work. You learned how a custom window can be useful in controlling the size of a game window. You also learned how to position images with blank gif files and tables.  Finally, you explored a reasonably involved simulation of a basketball game and saw how a number of utility functions can come together to make a reasonably interesting game program.  In the next chapter, you will see how cascading style sheets and other advanced HTML topics can be used to add motion and sound to JavaScript programs.  E X E R C I S E S  1. Modify the Basketball game so that it reflects the names of players on your favorite bas-  ketball team.  2. Modify the percentage table to reflect the characteristics of your team. For example, you might have a three-point shooter who’s a great shot, but who does not pass well. You can tweak the data in all kinds of ways to simulate this characteristic.  3. Add multiple levels of difficulty to the game. For the easier levels, make the opponent less likely to score a basket. At the more difficult levels, make an opponent score more likely.  4. Modify the graphics and the data table to simulate another similar sport, such as soccer,  hockey, or water polo.  5. Add randomly occurring penalties.  6. Many role-playing games and war games rely on two-dimensional data tables and dice throws. Modify the lookup program so that it simulates one of these tables and returns the results.  169  C h a p t e r 7  I        i  m a g e S w a p p n g a n d   L o o k u p   T a b l e s     :   T h e B a s k e t b a l l    G a m e    Dynamic HTML:  C H A P T E R  8  The Stealth Submarine So far, this book has tread on reasonably  safe ground. All the projects done so far should work even with the older brows- ers. For more sophisticated programs, you need to push the limits of JavaScript’s capabilities. In this chapter, you begin to do exactly that. Specifically, you will be looking at how to do the following:    Write cross-browser code    Write a browser-detection routine    Create positionable style sheet elements    Move floating elements    Change the text in floating elements    Work with sound files   172  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  All these techniques  and a few others  constitute dynamic HTML  DHTML . The tricks in this chapter pretty much push the modern browsers to their limits. As you read through the chapter, you will see a lot of detail, but don’t get overwhelmed. You should get a flavor for how to accomplish these tasks in typical DHTML, so that you can appre- ciate the library approach taken in the rest of the book. If you find the chapter a bit too challenging, feel free to skip ahead, then come back again after you have read some of the later chapters in the book.  The Project: The Stealth Submarine Program The program you will build is a strategy-puzzle game called Stealth Submarine. Here’s the premise: The player is a spy who has finished a dangerous mission. The player gets into a stealth minisub and has to maneuver the sub out of the harbor. Unfortu- nately, the enemy has been tipped off, and patrol boats lurk everywhere. If the player moves into a square occupied by an enemy patrol, the patrol will recognize the sub with a sonar ping.  If the enemy manages to get three pings on the submarine, the game is over. The spy has a device in the sub that tells how many patrol boats are in the vicinity. The player must use this device to find a safe way to the open ocean. When the player reaches the ocean, a nuclear submarine picks up the spy, and the player has won. Figures 8.1 through 8.3 show the game’s interface.  The Stealth Sub game introduces some new challenges. The submarine figure actually moves around on the screen under program control. In addition, the scoreboard and control pad are special elements that can also be moved and specially modified. The game also features sound.  FIGURE 8.1  The instruction and startup screen for the Stealth Sub  program.   173  C h a p t e r 8     D y n a m i c H T M L :   T h e S t e a l t h S u b m a r i n e        FIGURE 8.2  The player must sneak through a 10×10 patrol grid  to win.  FIGURE 8.3  In addition to seeing  dialog boxes, the  player hears various  sound effects associated with  winning, being sunk,  and sonar pings.  Dealing with Browser Dependency The interesting new features of the sub program come at a cost: Both of the major browsers can do all the necessary tasks, but they do them in completely different ways. For example, you can store a sound file in a property of the Internet Explorer browser, but you must embed all sound files as plug-ins for Netscape Navigator. I’ll take you through that mess later in the chapter, but this is a good illustration of the major   174  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  plague troubling client-side Web developers. The browser manufacturers have selectively ignored standards bodies in their attempts to build more powerful browsers. Although this means that each of the browsers has many interesting features, it is very difficult to write code that works properly on both browsers at the same time. Often you will find yourself having to write completely different code for the two main browsers. One solu- tion is simply to write code for one browser or another. This solution is fine on an intranet, or when you don’t mind losing part of your audience. On the other hand, many would claim  that  the  Internet  is  all  about  inclusiveness,  and  getting  beyond  hardware  and software boundaries. In that spirit, I’ve tried to write every program in this book so that it works with both browsers. In this chapter, you’ll see how you can write such code.  Creating the Browser Detective The key to writing cross-browser code is to have a browser detection script. Figures 8.4 and 8.5 show the interface for such a program.  The program is simple but very important. It determines by looking at the  document object model which browser is running the script, then returns an appropriate message.  Here is the code that generates the Browser Detective program.   Browser Detective            var bVersion = 0;  var isNav = false;  var isIE = false;  function checkBrowser  {  FIGURE 8.4  The page  recognizes that it is  in Netscape Navigator.   175  C h a p t e r 8     D y n a m i c H T M L :   T h e S t e a l t h S u b m a r i n e        FIGURE 8.5  This time the page was brought up in Internet Explorer.       Browser Detective       Andy Harris       Checks which browser is working    if  navigator.appName == "Netscape" {      isNav = true;    } else {        isIE = true;      }    end IE if    }    end Netscape if    bVersion = parseInt navigator.appVersion ;      if  navigator.appName == "Microsoft Internet Explorer" {      alert "Consider getting a newer browser! This code might not work!" ;      alert "I do not recognize this browser. This code might not work" ;    if  bVersion < 4 {    }    end if    if   !isNav  &&  !isIE  {    }    end if  }     end checkBrowser            176      Browser Detective      document.write "Netscape Navigator" ;      document.write "Internet Explorer" ;     checkBrowser  ;  if  isNav {  } else {    if  isIE {    }    end if  }    end if                 i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Detecting Which Browser Is Being Used There are many ways to do browser detection, but I prefer to work with three variables. I created a Boolean variable called isNav. This variable will be true when the program confirms that it is running in the Netscape Navigator browser. Another variable, called isIE, will be true only after the browser is confirmed as Internet Explorer. Another variable checks the version number of the browser. Since most dynamic HTML  includ- ing that which you will write throughout the rest of this book to accomplish many other tasks  requires version 4+ of one of these two browsers, it makes sense to check all these things.  Both of the major browsers have a navigator object, which contains information about the browser. The navigator object has a property called appName, which holds the name of the current browser, and another called appVersion, which holds the version number. The checkBrowser   function simply looks at these properties and assigns appropriate values to the three variables. Note that the version number is returned as a string value, so  the  program  forces  it  into  numeric  format.  To  see  how  the  program  uses  the checkBrowser   routine, take a look at the body of the HTML document. You can see a second script that starts with a call to the checkBrowser   function. The program then sends an appropriate message to the screen, based on the browser type detected.  Using Cascading Style Sheets Many of the most intriguing capabilities of JavaScript come from an understanding of  cascading  style  sheets   CSS .  This  technology  was  intended  to  add  flexibility  to HTML.  It  does  that,  and  it  also  adds  a  number  of  interesting  possibilities  for  the JavaScript program.   177  C h a p t e r 8     D y n a m i c H T M L :   T h e S t e a l t h S u b m a r i n e        FIGURE 8.6  A CSS style tag manages all the  special effects, the border, the colors, and the large font.  The Basics of CSS One use of CSS is simply to extend the capabilities of HTML. Figure 8.6 shows an ex- ample of a page that uses this basic form of cascading style sheets.  CSS elements extend HTML. The basic idea of CSS elements is that you can use them to extend any HTML tag. The CSS elements add an entirely new set of property character- istics to a document. Although there are a number of interesting CSS elements, the list of such elements that both browsers support is quite short. Table 8.1 illustrates a few of the key CSS options.  How to Add CSS Styles to an HTML Page There are a number of ways to incorporate style sheet elements into an HTML docu- ment. The easiest is to place a string containing CSS commands into an HTML tag’s style attribute. You should use semicolons  ;  to separate the commands. For example, to display a paragraph with green letters on a yellow background, you could use this variant of the   tag:     This is the green text on the yellow background     If you want to add a CSS style to an otherwise unremarkable piece of text, you can surround the text with the    or    tags and then attach a style to these tags. span and div are very useful as placeholders for CSS, because they do not have any other side effects of their own.   178  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  background-color  background-color:blue  Element  background-image  border-color  border-style  border-width  color  font-family  font-size  height  width  left  top  position  TABLE 8.1 CSS OPTIONS  bg.gif  Example  border-color:blue  border-width: 3px  border-style: double  Description Sets the color of whatever element is being described.

Working with Positionable CSS Elements CSS technology gives a level of control over HTML output that is very welcome to HTML authors. There is a special category of CSS commands that are even more important to a game author, because they enable elements to move around dynamically in the Web page. Figure 8.7 shows an example of this phenomenon, the Move Sub program.  Standard HTML  without CSS  does not let you move images  or anything else, for that matter  around on a page. Both of the major browsers allow a form of this behavior using elements that are formatted with special CSS characteristics. Start by looking at the HTML.         Move Sub       <input type = "button"   180  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 8.7  When the user clicks the button, the sub moves to  the right.         value = "Move the sub"         onClick = "moveSub  ">        <span name = "sub"        id = "sub"        style = "position: absolute;                 left: 50px;                 top: 200px;                 height: 30;                 width: 30;">                 Creating a Positionable Element The page features a form with a button on it and a  span object containing the sub graphic. A span object is a special HTML container that has almost no characteristics of its own. This makes it a great container for a style.  Notice the  position:  absolute part of the style definition. The  position attribute specifies that the element it describes can be positioned on the screen. Rather than   181  C h a p t e r 8     D y n a m i c H T M L :   T h e S t e a l t h S u b m a r i n e        having the sub follow the normal rules of HTML positioning, you can use the left and top CSS at- tributes to define the sub’s position. You can set the position as relative or absolute. Relative po- sitioning means that the left and top positions are calculated from where the HTML element would normally go. Absolute positioning refers to distance from the top-left corner of the current document, window, or frame. For game programming, you will usually be concerned with absolute positioning.  The left, top, height, and width elements are used to describe the position and size of the object. Like most CSS elements, these tags can use a variety of units of measurement, including inches  in , cen- timeters  cm , and pixels  px .  T R I C K  For game elements, I prefer to use pix- els,  because  then  the  relationships among various objects on the screen re- main constant even though the screen resolution is unpredictable.  You don’t know  the  resolution  of  every  player’s screen, but a pixel is always a pixel.   IN THE REAL WORLD  Cascading style sheets were de- veloped as a way to give more control to more advanced HTML authors without compromising the  basic  simplicity  of  the  lan- guage.  Positionable  elements can  give  the  programmer  fine- grained control over page layout of any type of Web page—a level of  control  that  is  not  possible with standard HTML. Still, you should be very careful to test any pages that you build with CSS elements,  because  the  major browsers do not follow the stan- dards in exactly the same way.  Moving a Positionable CSS Element with Code Once you have defined an HTML element with a positionable style, you can write code to move this element around the screen. Although both Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer support this behavior, they differ in the implementation details. The Browser Detective script from earlier in this chapter will be an important part of this page.  var bVersion = 0;  var isNav = false;  var isIE = false;  function checkBrowser  {       Browser Detective       Andy Harris      isNav = true;    } else {        isIE = true;      }    end IE if       Checks which browser is working    if  navigator.appName == "Netscape" {      if  navigator.appName == "Microsoft Internet Explorer" {   182    }    end Netscape if    bVersion = parseInt navigator.appVersion ;  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i      alert "Consider getting a newer browser! This code might not work!" ;      alert "I do not recognize this browser. This code might not work" ;    if  bVersion < 4 {    }    end if    if   !isNav  &&  !isIE  {    }    end if  }     end checkBrowser  checkBrowser  ;  function moveSub  {       Move Sub       Andy Harris    if  isNav {      document.sub.moveBy 20, 0 ;      if  document.sub.left > 300 {        document.sub.moveTo 50, 200 ;      }    end if    } else {      document.all.sub.style.pixelLeft+= 20;      if  document.all.sub.style.pixelLeft > 300 {        document.all.sub.style.pixelLeft = 50;      }    end if    }    end if  }    end moveSub  H I N T  The  first  part  of  the  code  is  the  checkBrowser    function  copied  directly  from  the earlier example in this chapter. The browser-detection variables are also copied verba- tim from the Browser Detective example.  Copying and pasting code is often not such a great idea. When you find yourself replicating code, it’s usually a sign that you could write the code more efficiently. Even though it is very easy to copy and paste code, you will almost always end up spending a great deal of time and effort making small modifications to each of the copies. A little bit of time spent designing the code to be reused can reap large benefits down the road.  You’ll learn a way to import code from an external library in the next chapter. For now, however, the copying and pasting technique is accept- able for a code fragment as small as this one.   The  checkBrowser    line  runs  the  checkBrowser    function  to  determine  which browser is active.  Moving an Element in Netscape Navigator Both of the major browsers allow you to work with positionable elements, but they use different syntax. Ultimately, they use a different object model to describe the same kinds of elements. Figure 8.8 shows how Netscape Navigator sees positionable elements.  Netscape Navigator provides a special object called a layer. This is essentially a float- ing frame that can be positioned dynamically. When you assign the position attribute to a CSS style in Netscape Navigator, the browser automatically converts that element to a  layer object. The  name attribute of any element contained in the  style tag be- comes the name of the layer object.  The layer object has some very useful properties and methods. If you want to move a layer object to a specific spot, you can use the moveTo   method to move to a specific x,y coordinate  in pixels . If you want to move a specific amount, you can use the moveBy   method instead. Additionally, you can directly access the left and top properties of the layer to determine where the layer object is or to set the object’s position.  Here again is the Netscape Navigator-specific code for the Move Sub program:  if  isNav {      document.sub.moveBy 20, 0 ;      if  document.sub.left > 300 {        document.sub.moveTo 50, 200 ;      }    end if  The element in question is called sub. Because it has a position attribute, Netscape Navigator treats it as a layer. The moveBy command moves the object 20 pixels to the left. An if statement checks to see if the sub has moved past pixel 300. If so, it resets the sub’s position.  T R I C K  Remember, whenever you have code that increments or decrements a variable, you should think about checking for boundaries.  183  C h a p t e r 8     D y n a m i c H T M L :   T h e S t e a l t h S u b m a r i n e        Netscape Navigator Model  document  layerName  moveTo x,y  moveBy x,y  top left  FIGURE 8.8  A positionable  element in  Netscape Navigator  becomes a  layer object.   184  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  The Internet Explorer Approach Internet Explorer has a different but similar way of looking at positionable elements. IE does not recognize layer objects, but can directly move an element specified by a positionable style. Figure 8.9 shows how the Internet Explorer document model sees positionable elements.  IE has a special feature called all, which is a container for all the objects on the form. The sub object is one of the elements on the form, so you can reach it from all. Note that IE does not use layer objects, but allows you to consider any object potentially moveable.  However,  the  element  with  the  positionable  CSS  style  does  not  have  the left and top properties directly. These properties belong to the style property of the object. Finally, the properties are not called left and top, but pixelLeft and pixelTop. The IE-specific code in the Move Sub program looks like this:      document.all.sub.style.pixelLeft+= 20;      if  document.all.sub.style.pixelLeft > 300 {        document.all.sub.style.pixelLeft = 50;      }    end if  The first line moves the  sub element 20 pixels to the left. The  if statement checks whether the sub is past pixel 300. If so, the statement resets the position.  H I N T  If you are a Netscape Navigator fan, you might be feeling smug about how much easier this process is in Netscape than in IE. Moving an object is easier in Netscape Navigator, but you’ll find a lot of other tasks to be easier in Internet Explorer. If you want to write cross-browser programs, it doesn’t really matter which is easier; you have an obligation to write for both browsers.  Internet Explorer Model  document  all  elementName  style  pixelLeft pixelTop  FIGURE 8.9  The element is part of something called  all and has a style property with some useful  features.   IN THE REAL WORLD  If you think it’s crazy that the browser manufacturers cannot agree on how to move an object around, you are not alone. Most of the interesting things you can do in dynamic HTML require you to consider similar problems.  You could choose to write your programs for only one browser, but then you might lose part of your audience. You could also write two complete versions of each program, but users would still end up at the wrong version of the page.  My preferred technique is to check the browser type, then put a branch in each function that has browser-specific techniques. Executing this technique is a pain, but it will have to do until the browser manufacturers decide to agree on a standard.  Starting with the next chapter, you’ll see another solution that eliminates some of these prob- lems, but I want you to see how to build browser-independent code yourself so that you can appreciate the code library techniques that you’ll see in the later chapters.  Changing the Text in a Positionable Element Once you have defined an HTML element with a position style, you can also write new HTML to that element. This is  of course  done differently in Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer, but the result is the same. Figures 8.10 and 8.11 show the interface for the program that illustrates how you can write new HLML to a defined element.  185  C h a p t e r 8     D y n a m i c H T M L :   T h e S t e a l t h S u b m a r i n e        FIGURE 8.10  The user can  type data into the  text box.   186  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 8.11  The program  repeats the text in a  positionable  element.            Writing to a layer    <span name = "output"        id = "output"        class = "output"        style = "position:absolute;                 left: 200px;                 top: 200px;">  Default text        <input type = "text"         name = "txtInput">     <input type = "button"         value = "change output"         onClick = "changeIt  ">        The program copies the contents of the text box to a positionable element. Unfortu- nately, the two major browsers have entirely different ways of performing this feat. Still, the HTML is the same, regardless of the browser. Here is the HTML code:   187  C h a p t e r 8     D y n a m i c H T M L :   T h e S t e a l t h S u b m a r i n e        Note the existence of the span object with a positionable style. This is the part of the code that will be modified. It has a name attribute and an ID attribute. Netscape gener- ally refers to the span object  with the the name attribute, and IE generally prefers the ID attribute, so I simply add them both with the same value.  The code for changing the text in the span object is very browser-dependent. The func- tion starts by checking which browser is active, and then writes to the span object in a manner appropriate to that browser. Here is the changeIt   function:  function changeIt  {       Writing to a layer       Andy Harris    checkBrowser  ;    var theText = document.theForm.txtInput.value;    if  isNav {      document.output.document.open  ;      document.output.document.write theText ;      document.output.document.close  ;      document.all.output.innerHTML = theText;    } else {    }    end if  }    end changeIt  The code between the if statement and the else statement will execute only if Netscape navigator  is the current browser. The code between the else clause and the end  if statement will execute only when Internet Explorer is running.  As you can see, the browsers take a very different approach to this particular problem.  IN THE REAL WORLD  You might use the ability to change an element selectively anywhere that you want to change output directly on the page, without resorting to text areas or frames for output. This ap- proach could be useful in any applications in which you want it to seem as though parts of the page are changing on the fly. You can get a very seamless look with dynamic elements such as these, but the capability comes at the cost of some simplicity.  For example, I once wrote an online catalog, which looked to the user like a database. The user saw a product on the screen with an image and a description. The screen also contained buttons to go to the next or previous product. When the user clicked the buttons, the description and the image changed, apparently in the current page. The description and other text fields were all span objects, and I rewrote the text in the spans each time the user asked for a new element.   188  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Internet Explorer Model  document  all  elementName  innerHtml  FIGURE 8.12  The positionable element has an  innerHTML  property.  Writing to a span Object in Internet Explorer The Internet Explorer document model recognizes a span as an object accessible from the all group, as you may remember from earlier in the chapter. The span object has an innerHTML property. You can change the text of the span object by assigning new HTML to it. You can send plain text to a span object, or send more complex HTML code to the span object if you wish. Figure 8.12 is a diagram of the Microsoft model.  The IE version of the code is very straightforward:  document.all.output.innerHTML = theText;  Any value that you want to write to the element can be copied to the innerHTML prop- erty of that element.  Writing to a span Object in Netscape Navigator The Netscape  document object model does not recognize the  innerHTML property. In- stead, the positionable element is more like a frame or an external window. It has a document object of its own, with all the characteristics of any other document object. Figure 8.13 is a diagram of the Netscape point of view.  Netscape Navigator Model  document  layerName  document  open   write   close    FIGURE 8.13  The layerName has a document  object. You can  open, write to, and  close the new  document just as if  it were a frame.   189  C h a p t e r 8     D y n a m i c H T M L :   T h e S t e a l t h S u b m a r i n e        The  Netscape  approach  is  to  treat  the  new  element  like  a  frame.  It  has  a  document object to which you can write. Of course, before you write to a document object, you should open it; then, after you write to the document object, you should close it. Here’s the Netscape version of the code:      document.output.document.open  ;      document.output.document.write theText ;      document.output.document.close  ;  H I N T  The document.output.document syntax looks very strange, but it makes sense if you understand how Netscape is viewing the structure. The first reference to document refers to the primary document object. Almost every object reference in JavaScript begins like this. output is the name of a property in the document object,  specifically  a  positionable  element.  The  full  name  of  this  element  is document.object. Because it has its own document object, you refer to the docu- ment object of the output layer as  document.object.document. The code is writing to the document object of the layer.  Adding Cross-Platform Sound Sound effects are an important part of game devel- opment. They can add quite a bit to the ambiance of the game and can provide important cues to the user without taking up real estate on the screen.  Both major browsers allow you to play sounds from your JavaScript code. You might not be surprised to find that the technique for storing and playing sounds  are  totally  different  for  Netscape  and Internet Explorer. Figure 8.14 shows a program that demonstrates sound files.  It is not terribly difficult to add sound to a page as a hyperlink, but the browsers have very different techniques for embedding a sound into the page to be played under the control of a program. Here is the HTML code for the sound demo program:     IN THE REAL WORLD  Many kinds of pages can benefit from audio support. Educational programs often benefit from au- dio. You might have the program say the names of different parts of an engine as the user clicks an image, or you could write a pro- gram that speaks short phrases in several languages. Remember that sound files can take a long time  to  download,  so  you  will need to be creative about using them. Still, the potential benefits of sound are tremendous.     <embed mayScript         name = "sndPing"         src = "ping.wav"         hidden = "true"         autostarts = "false">      190  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 8.14  When the user  clicks the button, a  sound plays.     <input type = button         value = "ping!"         onClick = playPing  >           When it comes to sound manipulation, the browsers don’t even agree on the HTML technique. You embed sound in a page via the embed tag in Netscape and through the bgSound tag in IE.  The Netscape Navigator Approach to Sound The Netscape view relies on helper applications. If you want to generate a sound in a Netscape document, you use the embed tag to indicate that a certain type of file should be embedded into the application  see Figure 8.15 . When attempting to render the page, the browser looks at the src property of the embed tag to determine a plug-in to use. In the case of .wav or .midi files, Netscape uses a default media player. For sounds that a program will control, you should probably set the  hidden and  autostart at- tributes  to  false.  The  mayScript  attribute  indicates  that  the  application  will  access some of the methods or properties of the actual object through a script.  The media player object that Netscape uses to load the sound has a play   method. When invoked, this method plays the sound. In addition, you can dynamically change the value of the src property to change the sound being played.   Netscape Navigator Sound  FIGURE 8.15  To play a sound in Netscape, you must  have an embed object, which has src property and a play   method.  document  embedName  src play    The Netscape-specific technique for playing the sound is as follows:      document.sndPing.src = "ping.wav";      document.sndPing.play  ;  T R A P  Netscape’s approach to scriptable sound is notoriously fragile. The user might in- stall some other kinds of helper applications or plug-ins, which would make the browser incapable of playing the sounds. You might want to add a “no sound” op- tion to your programs, so those users who experience problems can simply skip sound but still have a working program.  The Internet Explorer Approach to Sound Fortunately, the sound model for Internet Explorer is a little more robust. IE supports the bgSound HTML tag. This tag is often used to generate a sound to play in the back- ground. Many people find background sounds that cannot be turned off irritating, so the IE sound model enables you to control the tag through scripts. Figure 8.16 shows how the IE document model sees sounds.  The JavaScript code to play the sound is reasonably simple. It is as follows:  document.all.bgPing.src = "ping.wav";  191  C h a p t e r 8     D y n a m i c H T M L :   T h e S t e a l t h S u b m a r i n e        Sounds in Internet Explorer  document  all  bgSound  src  FIGURE 8.16  The bgSound object has a scriptable src  property.   192  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Putting It Together in the Stealth Sub Game The Stealth Sub game takes all the elements in this chapter, plus a few ideas from earlier in the book, to make an interesting action strategy game. The game’s design utilizes positionable elements heavily. It also features sound and a simple lookup table. The main screen is called from another page, just as in the Basketball game in Chapter 7, “Image Swapping and Lookup Tables: The Basketball Game”. This technique guarantees that the new browser page will be an appropriate size and will not be resized by the user.  Writing the HTML Code The design of the main sub page is reasonably simple: The background is drawn in with a grid on it. The page contains three positionable elements. The sub itself is a span object. The scoreboard also is a span object. This element does not move but con- tains all the scoring results. The score is updated inside the scoreboard dynamically and looks like it’s a natural part of the game screen. Finally, the control buttons are also part of a positioned element. This approach offers the easiest way to make sure that the buttons are positioned well.  Here is the HTML code for the Stealth Sub game:  <body onLoad = "init  "        background = "ocean.gif">        style = "position:absolute; left:22px; top:125px">  <span name = "sub"        id = "sub"  <img src = "sub.gif"       height = 30       width = 30>     <span id = "output"        name = "output"        style = "position:absolute;                 left:330px; top:30px;                 color:white;                 background-color:red;                 border-style:ridge;                 height:60;                 width:60;">  row: 5  col: 0  boats: 0        detected 0 times   193  C h a p t e r 8     D y n a m i c H T M L :   T h e S t e a l t h S u b m a r i n e                 <input type = "button"         value = " \"         onClick = "moveSub NORTH ">     <input type = "button"         value = "<--"         onClick = "moveSub WEST ">  <input type = "button"         value = "-->"         onClick = "moveSub EAST ">     <input type = "button"         value = "\ "         onClick = "moveSub SOUTH ">              <Embed src = "ping.wav"         name = "ping"         hidden = "true"         mayScript = "true"         autostart = "false"         mastersound>   <Embed src = "boat.wav"         name = "boat"         hidden = "true"         mayScript = "true"         autostart = "false"         mastersound>   <Embed src = "dive.wav"         name = "dive"         hidden = "true"          mayScript = "true"         autostart = "false"         mastersound>   <Embed src = "torp.wav"         name = "torp"         hidden = "true"         mayScript = "true"         autostart = "false"         mastersound>                  194  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  var isNav = false;  var isIE = false;  var NORTH = 0;  var EAST = 1;  var SOUTH = 2;  var WEST = 3;  var rows = 10;  var cols = 10;  var currentRow = 5;  var currentCol = 1;  var numHits = 0;  var grid = new Array  ;  As you can see, the HTML code defines the positionable elements and embeds all the sounds as hidden sounds for Netscape. It also provides a bgSound object for IE. When the body of the page loads, it calls the init   function to do some initializing. All four buttons call the moveSub   function, but with a different value indicating which direc- tion to move the submarine.  Making the Global Variables When you are examining a new program, one of the best ways to get an overview is to look at the variables that are defined outside the functions. These should give you some idea of the data that is used in the program. Here’s the code that generates these variables:   The program has variables to determine which browser is active. It also has a series of variables  NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, and WEST  to simplify working with the directions. Since the value of these variables should not change, I capitalized them to remind myself that I consider them constants.  The rows and cols variables specify how many rows and columns are in the grid structure.  H I N T  The actual white grid that the user sees is simply a graphic background, and it has no real relationship to the program. I carefully designed the graphic background so that it would have the right number of rows and columns, but all the program needs is the value of the variables. The background could be anything. My first draft of the program didn’t have a grid drawn on the screen at all, but my primary beta tester  my wife  said that the game was dumb without a visible grid. Always listen to your beta testers, especially if you are married to them!  The currentRow and currentCol variables are used to determine where the submarine currently is inside the grid structure. The numHits variable tracks how many times the player has been pinged.  The most critical variable in the game is called grid. It is a two-dimensional array that keeps track of where the patrol boats are. Since the player cannot see the boats directly, it is important to have some way of tracking their position. The grid array does this.  The grid variable is the key data structure underlying the program. Everything else in the game somehow relates to this two-dimensional array. Figure 8.17 shows how the grid might actually look.  The playing surface is 10 by 10 cells. The program includes a function that analyzes a cell and counts the values in all its neighbors. It would be very difficult to account for all the variations around the edges, so the easiest solution is to add a border of 0s all around. The only grid spaces that you will allow as positions for the sub are in the 1–10 range; however, other cells containing the value 0 surround this range of cells, so any cell the sub is on is guaranteed to have four neighbor cells.  195  C h a p t e r 8     D y n a m i c H T M L :   T h e S t e a l t h S u b m a r i n e        FIGURE 8.17 The grid is a 10×10 matrix with a border  of 0s around it.   196  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Creating the Functions In addition to looking at the global variables in a program, it’s a great idea to look briefly at the functions provided in a program. This can give you a useful overview of how the program will work. Once you have a wide view, you can look more carefully at the specific functions and see how they work.  checkBrowser   The checkBrowser   function checks the browser and sets isNav or isIE variables to true or false. This section doesn’t repeat the code, because you’ve seen it several times already.  init   The  init   function initializes key variables in the game, calls the  checkBrowser   routine, calls the grid-creation routine, and positions the sub graphic in the appropriate starting position. The function is called in the onLoad event of the body and whenever the user restarts the game. Here’s the code for the init   function:  function init  {    checkBrowser  ;    makeGrid  ;    playSound "dive" ;    currentRow = 5;    currentCol = 1;    numHits = 0;      updateScore  ;    if  isNav {    } else {    }    end if  }    end init      move sub to starting position      document.sub.moveTo 22, 125 ;      document.all.sub.style.pixelLeft = 22;      document.all.sub.style.pixelTop = 125;  makeGrid   This function turns the grid array into a two-dimensional array to contain the boat data. The resulting grid is actually larger than the number of rows and columns the user will see, to account for the border of 0 cells around the edges. Each element in the grid will contain a 0  no boat present  or a 1  there is a boat in this cell . Each square has a 30 percent chance of having a boat in it. The boats are placed randomly. The simplest way to change the difficulty of the game is to change the likelihood that each cell has a boat in it. A value less than .30 makes the game easier, and a value greater than .30 makes the game more difficult. The code for makeGrid   looks like the following:  function makeGrid  {    var row = 0;   197  C h a p t e r 8     D y n a m i c H T M L :   T h e S t e a l t h S u b m a r i n e          var col = 0;      clear out borders    for  row = 0; row <= rows+1; row++ {      grid[row] = new Array  ;      grid[row][0] = 0;      grid[row][cols+1] = 0;    }    end row      grid[0][col] = 0;      grid[rows + 1][col] = 0;    }    end col    for  col = 0; col <= cols+1; col++ {      randomly populate middle    for  row = 1; row <= rows; row++ {      for  col = 1; col <= cols; col++ {        if  Math.random   < .30 {          grid[row][col] = 1;        } else {          grid[row][col] = 0;        }    end if      }    end col for    }    end row for  }    end makeGrid  getGrid   The getGrid   function is a utility function that I used for debugging the program. Since there is no visual representation of the grid, I wanted to make sure that it was being created properly, so I wrote a little function to display the grid contents quickly in an alert box. The final program does not need the function, but it’s so handy for debugging that I decided not to take it out. However, this section does not repeat the code. If you want to see the code for this function, look on the CD-ROM that accompanies this book.  countBoats   The countBoats   function looks at the grid cell related to currentRow and currentCol and determines how many of the cell’s neighbors contain patrol boats. The function adds up the grid values for the four cells immediately surrounding the current cell. The  program  returns  this  value  as  the  sensor’s  value.  Recall  that  the  sensor  is  the instrument on the player’s submarine that returns how many patrol boats are nearby. This procedure would have been much more complicated if it had to act differently on those cells that do not have four neighbors  such as corners and borders . I added a padding of 0-value cells around the edge of the grid to simplify coding of this function.   198  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  It is interesting that this function doesn’t simply stop when it is finished, but returns the number of boats. Here’s how the function looks:  function countBoats  {    var numBoats = 0;      given current row and column, count how many boats are nearby    numBoats += grid[currentRow - 1][currentCol];    numBoats += grid[currentRow][currentCol - 1];    numBoats += grid[currentRow][currentCol + 1];    numBoats += grid[currentRow + 1][currentCol];    return numBoats;  }   end countBoats  updateScore   The  updateScore   function does exactly what it says: It updates the scoreboard. It examines  several  of  the  key  variables  and  concatenates  them  into  an  HTML  string, which the function then prints out to a positionable element.  function updateScore  {    var score = "";    score += " ";    score += "row: " + currentRow + " ";    score += " col: " + currentCol + " ";    score += " boats: " + countBoats   + " ";    score += " detected: " + numHits + " times ";    score += " ";    if  isNav {      document.output.resizeTo 50,50 ;      document.output.document.open  ;      document.output.document.write score ;      document.output.document.close  ;      document.all.output.innerHTML = score;    } else {    }    end if  }    end updateScore  Note the way that the program invokes the countBoats   function. Since countBoats   returns a number, the program can assign that value directly to a variable.  playSound   Given the name of a sound file, the playSound   routine attempts to play that sound in a platform-appropriate manner. Here’s the code for playSound  :  function playSound soundName {     if  isNav {        var player = eval "document." + soundName ;       player.play  ;     } else {    }    end if  }    end playSound       var soundFile = soundName + ".wav";       document.all.soundPlayer.src = soundFile;  This particular approach depends on the embedded objects having exactly the same name as the filename of the .wav file.  moveSub   The sub expects to receive a direction variable  NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, or WEST . The moveSub routine is called by all the button-press events. When the user clicks a button, it calls the moveSub routine with a parameter describing the direction the sub should be moved. The function analyzes that parameter, moves the submarine image appropriately, and checks to see if the sub has been pinged.  function moveSub direction {  199  C h a p t e r 8     D y n a m i c H T M L :   T h e S t e a l t h S u b m a r i n e          var dx = 0;    var dy = 0;    switch  direction {      case 0:        dx = 0;        dy = -30;        currentRow--;        currentCol++;        break;      case 1:        dx = 30;        dy = 0;        break;      case 2:        dx = 0;        dy = 30;        currentRow++;        break;      case 3 :        dx = -30;        dy = 0;        currentCol--;        break;    }    end switch      document.sub.moveBy dx, dy ;    if  isNav {    } else {   200  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i      document.all.sub.style.pixelLeft += dx;      document.all.sub.style.pixelTop += dy;    }    end if      check for win    if  currentCol > 10 {      playSound "dive" ;      alert "You Win!!!" ;      init  ;    }    end if      check for hit    if  grid[currentRow][currentCol] == 1 {      playSound "ping" ;      numHits++;      if  numHits >=3 {        playSound "torp" ;        alert "You've been sunk!!" ;        init  ;      }    end sunk if    }    end  hit if    updateScore  ;  }    end moveSub  For each direction, the routine updates the currentRow and currentCol variables and changes the position of the sub graphic.  The moveSub   function then checks whether the sub has reached the open ocean. If so, the player wins, and the program resets the game by calling the init   function.  Finally, the moveSub   function checks for a boat in the current cell. If there is one, the function plays the ping sound, then checks whether this is the third ping. If so, the game is over, so the program plays the explosion sound and resets the game with a call to init  . Table 8.2 details the new syntax I’ve covered in this chapter.  Summary This chapter took you through the somewhat frightening world of cross-platform dy- namic HTML. You learned how to write code that can determine which browser the user is running. You experimented with cascading style sheet  CSS  syntax as a way to add formatting to your HTML code. You learned how you can use positionable CSS  to posi- tion your HTML elements more precisely. You built programs that moved an element, changed its text, and played sounds. You have started to grapple with the intricacies of cross-platform design, and have no doubt struggled to make your code work well on either browser. In short, you have earned the right to call yourself a DHTML program- mer. In the next chapter, you’ll learn an easier way to develop code that works on any modern browser, that allows you to concentrate more on your game and less on how each browser performs each particular task.   201  C h a p t e r 8     D y n a m i c H T M L :   T h e S t e a l t h S u b m a r i n e        TABLE 8.2 SYNTAX SUMMARY  Example  var theBrowser =  Description Returns the browser’s name as a string.

Modify the sub program so that it has another theme.  You are escaping from prison, sneaking into enemy headquarters, or searching for some type of treasure.  Consider adding multiple levels of difficulty.  2. Make an enhanced version of the sensor that would still return a number, but with the following difference: a boat to the north is 1 point, one to the west is 2, a boat to the south is 4, and a boat to the east is 8. If the user can figure out the code, he or she can always tell exactly where the boats are. As a bonus, this would be a fun way to teach binary notation, if you happen to be a computer science teacher or something similar.  3. The sound techniques described in this chapter can also be used to play .midi files. Build a jukebox that plays a sound file based on a particular button press. Be sure to check with the owner of a file before using it. Change the output of one of your earlier programs so that it uses a CSS element instead of a frame or text box.  4. Make a home page that the user navigates by moving some object around on the page. For example, if you have a page about turtles, let the user move a turtle around the page. When the turtle is at an appropriate place  for example, over the word “photos” , the appropriate page  a photo gallery  automatically pops up in another frame.  202  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i   C H A P T E R  9  Sprite Animation:  The Racer  As  your  programs  have  become  more  powerful, you have spent more effort making them function across browsers. It would be nice to have a trick that would elimi- nate browser-dependency issues and let you con- centrate on writing functional programs. Such a technology exists, and you will learn about it in this chapter. Specifically, you will learn:    What an API library is    How to import external JavaScript libraries    What a sprite is and how to make one    How to move sprites    How to deal with frame animation in sprites    How to react to collisions between sprites    How to determine elapsed time for  scorekeeping   The Project: The Racer Program To illustrate all these points, you will build a program that simulates a top-down view of a racing car. The user will be able to control the car through on-screen controls and will have to drive the car as quickly as possible through a series of tracks. Figures 9.1 through 9.4 show the game’s interface.  The game looks interesting enough, but some of its features make the game impres- sive from a technical point of view. The game is designed to be very easy to customize.  204  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 9.1  The instruction form contains a button to launch the game.  FIGURE 9.2  You control the car  with the little dashboard and  the mouse.   205  C h a p t e r 9     S p r i t e A n m a t i o n  i     :   T h e R a c e r  FIGURE 9.3  Avoid the black obstacles; the car stops if you hit one  of them.  FIGURE 9.4  The tracks get more  difficult as you  advance in the game.  It is reasonably simple to build new tracks. As long as you understand the principles, you can easily customize the tracks however you wish. In fact, you could even add a track editor and let the user design new tracks.  That will be one of the exercises at the end of the chapter.  The racing game is reasonably browser-independent; it does not appear to have a single line of browser-checking code, yet it uses positionable elements and dynamic images.   206  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Introducing the Sprite Game  developers  have  been  using  graphic  objects  for  a  long  time.  They  invented  a term for a special kind of graphic used in game programming, called the sprite. In theoretical terms, a sprite is an object that can be used in a game environment. The user can move a sprite to a specific position. The sprite should be able to change its image on demand. A sprite also should be able to recognize collisions with other sprites, and it is quite useful if a sprite has some other attributes such as speed and direction.  JavaScript does not directly provide the sprite element, but theoretically you can give an object all the characteristics of the sprite object through the techniques that you learned in the last chapter. It would be great if there was some kind of object you could just magically invoke that would act like a sprite. It would be even better if you could just tell the sprite object to move or change its graphic; then you wouldn’t have to worry about what kind of positionable element or layer manipulation was happening behind the scene.  IN THE REAL WORLD  The ability to use APIs is one of the  most  important  skills  in modern programming. It is ex- tremely common to have prob- lems  that  extend  beyond  the original  scope  of  a  language. Programmers  working  on  all kinds of projects can often find or build APIs to help solve such problems. There are APIs for cre- ating  graphics,  adding  special input output devices, and work- ing  with  databases  and  many other kinds of applications.  Fortunately, a number of reusable JavaScript objects have been invented. Several authors have been work- ing on special libraries, called Application Program- ming Interfaces  APIs , that simplify the tedium of programming  with  positionable  elements  in JavaScript. Using these libraries can spare you the challenges of writing cross-platform dynamic HTML and let you focus on the interesting things, such as writing your games and other programs.  Throughout the rest of this book, I will demonstrate one  library  that  is  optimized  for  game  program- ming. The library, called gameLib, was written by Scott Porter. This excellent set of programs makes JavaScript game development much easier than it was just a couple of years ago.  The  latest  version  of  the  gameLib  library  and  its documentation are provided on the CD-ROM that accompanies this book. Refer to that documenta- tion for instructions on installing the library.  Creating the Sprite Program You can investigate the gameLib API by examining a very simple program that uses the library to draw a sphere on the screen. Figure 9.5 shows the program’s interface. At first the API will not seem to provide much benefit, but you soon will see how power- ful sprite objects can be.  Although this page could be produced using standard HTML, it was not. There are a number of interesting things happening in this program.   207  C h a p t e r 9     S p r i t e A n m a t i o n  i     :   T h e R a c e r  FIGURE 9.5  The page looks  unremarkable from  the user’s point  of view.  Importing a Code Library The programs in this chapter all use modules from the gameLib library. Rather than copying all the code of the library, you can use a variation of the script tag to export text files with JavaScript functions. Following is the code that performs that function in the Sprite program:         Sprite                  The  script  tag  has  an  src  parameter  that  can  be  assigned  a  URL.  In  this  case,  the program is loading two modules. The first one is called gamelib_core.js.  This module contains a bunch of utility functions and methods that are used by the other modules. As a programmer, you will not need all these features directly, but you may want to look at the documentation to see which ones might be useful. Every program that uses the gameLib library must import the gamelib_core module.   208  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  The program also imports the gamelib_sprites module. This is also a text file that contains JavaScript code for manipulating sprite objects. This code contains the defi- nition of the sprite object, as well as all the code that will enable the sprite objects to operate in a platform-appropriate manner. Importing the library in this way has the  same  effect  as  copying  the  entire  JavaScript  file  and  pasting  it  into  your  pro- gram, but you don’t have to look at all the details of the code.  Using the Sprite Object The  sprite  object  defined  by  the  gameLib  API  is  a  very  powerful  object.  It  uses JavaScript’s variation of object-oriented programming, which means that the sprite object  has  properties  and  methods. Properties  are  characteristics  that  describe  the object, such as x, y, height, and width. In the gameLib API, most properties are read- only, which means that you use them to get information about the sprite object. To change the sprite’s behavior or appearance, you use methods instead. A method is a special function that is attached to a particular type of object. Tables 9.1 and 9.2 list the sprite object’s primary methods and properties.  H I N T  Don’t worry if you don’t understand these tables on your first glance. You’ll get to see most of these properties and methods in action as the chapter progresses. The tables simply give you a bird’s-eye view of the sprite object’s properties and meth- ods before you actually begin using them.  From a quick look at these tables, you can see that the sprite object is quite powerful. In general, you can use the sprite’s methods to control the sprite, and use its proper- ties to inquire about the sprite. The tables might seem a little bit intimidating, but managing sprites is not very difficult at all.  Initializing the Sprite Here is the code fragment that starts up the sprite for the Sprite program.    ball.setImage "redball.gif", 20, 20, 1, 1 ;     var ball;  function init  {    ball = new Sp_Sprite  ;    ball.moveTo 100,100 ;    ball.setXlimits 0, 500 ;    ball.setYlimits 0, 300 ;    ball.setFrame 0 ;    ball.switchOn  ;  }    end init      TABLE 9.1 KEY PROPERTIES OF THE SPRITE OBJECT IN GAMELIB  Property on  read-only   x, y, height, width  read-only  Bounces  read-write   Xdir, ydir  read-only   Xydegs  read-only   Speed  read-only   Collides  read-write   if  mySprite.x < 0 {  Example  Description Describes whether the sprite if  mySprite.on { is visible.   do something } Describes the current size and position of the sprite. Determines behavior when the sprite reaches defined limits; if true, the sprite bounces off the border. Determines the speed of the sprite in x and y  mySprite.x = 0; }  mySprite.bounces = true;  if  mySprite.xdir == 0   {   alert  "not going  directions.sideways!" ; }  if  mySprite.xydegs ==  0 {   alert  "going  north!" ; }    end if  alert  mySprite.speed ;  mySprite.collides = true;  Shows the direction that the sprite is moving in degrees. Shows the speed of the sprite. Determines whether the sprite registers collisions.  209  C h a p t e r 9     S p r i t e A n m a t i o n  i     :   T h e R a c e r  The code starts by creating a variable  ball  that will contain the sprite. The variable is declared outside any functions, so it can be used anywhere. The code also defines an init   function, which the program will call when the body loads. This init   func- tion is normal for any type of initialization, and you will usually need something like this function when you work with sprites.  Inside init  , I created a new sprite with this line:  ball = new Sp_Sprite  ;  Notice the  new keyword. You have used it before when creating instances of objects. This line generates a new Sp_Sprite object called ball.  H I N T  The sprite object in gameLib is technically called a Sp_Sprite because that’s the name of the class that Porter built. He decided to begin the name of everything defined in his sprite module with Sp_ so that it would be easier to sort out when debugging the API package. You will almost always refer to your sprite objects by the variable names you assign to them, so the distinction between sprites  a generic term  and Sp_Sprites  the specific term used in gameLib  is not very important.   210  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  TABLE 9.2 PRINCIPAL METHODS OF THE SPRITE OBJECT IN GAMELIB  MoveTo x,y   mySprite.moveTo 100, 50 ;  Method  HasHit object   SetDir x,y   SetXYdegs direc   SetImage image,  width, height,  frames, anims   SetFrame number   Example  if  car.hasHit   barrier  {  alert "crash!" ; }  mySprite.setDir 1,3 ;    moves sprite 1 to  left, 3 down  mySprite.setXYdegs 45 ;    moves sprite northeast  mySprite.setImage   "car.gif", 20, 20,  1, 1 ;  mySprite.setFrame 2 ;  Description Determines whether one sprite has collided with another.

When you set up a sprite’s image, you need to specify a number of parameters about the object. For the ball example, here is the setImage   line:  ball.setImage "redball.gif", 20, 20, 1, 1 ;  Because ball is an instance of the Sprite class, you can invoke all of its methods. I set its image to "redball.gif". You can assign any image to a sprite with an absolute or local URL. The next two numbers  20, 20  indicate the size of the sprite. This does not have to be the same as the size of the starting image. The next two parameters  1, 1    211  C h a p t e r 9     S p r i t e A n m a t i o n  i     :   T h e R a c e r  refer to the frame and animation levels of the image. You’ll learn about frame anima- tion later in this chapter and in the next chapter, but for now, you’ll leave these values at 1 to make a simple image with one frame and one animation.  Setting the Ball’s Initial Position The following line moves the ball to the indicated position:  ball.moveTo 100,100 ;  When the sprite is displayed, this position is where the ball will appear on the screen. Remember that  0, 0  is in the upper-left corner. The coordinates indicate the location of the top-left corner of the sprite.  The next two lines determine boundaries on the screen. Whenever you create a sprite, you should set its limits using these two methods.    ball.setXlimits 0, 500 ;    ball.setYlimits 0, 300 ;  The playing field thus will extend from  0, 0  to  500, 300 . This is a reasonable size for a game, as it will fit inside most commonly used screen resolutions. Of course, the ball isn’t moving yet, so specifying boundaries might seem silly at this point. However, you will be modifying this program soon to move the ball.  T R A P  Even if you have sprites that will not move at all, be sure to set limits for them. The default values for the x and y limits seem to be very small, and your sprite might not appear in the right place  or at all  on the screen. Be sure that you have limits broad enough to show the sprite. Also be careful to place the sprite far enough inside these limits so that it is still visible. If you create sprites that are not appearing in the correct places, check whether you have set the limits correctly.  Turning On the Sprite The last two lines of the init   function do some more housekeeping. The following line specifies that the original frame be used:  ball.setFrame 0 ;  You’ll learn more about frames in the next section. For now, just accept that it is neces- sary to set the frame to 0.  Then the last line turns the ball on and makes it visible to the user, like this:  ball.switchOn  ;  Moving Sprites Around All of the sprite stuff seems like a lot of work, but it really pays off when you start making the sprites do interesting things, like move around on the screen and crash into things.   212  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 9.6  When the user  clicks a button, the ball moves in the direction indicated  by the button.  Creating the Moving Sprite Program By making a few modifications to the Sprite program, you can make a ball that bounces around on the screen. Figure 9.6 shows just such a program.  Although you can’t see it in Figure 9.6, the ball automatically bounces off any of the limits and reverses direction appropriately. The most exciting thing about this pro- gram is that most of the new code is HTML for the buttons. The sprite object contains most of the code required to handle the motion of the ball.  Modifying the init   Method I added two modifications to the init   method.    ball.bounces = true;    Gl_start  ;  The ball.bounces line tells the ball sprite that it should use ”bouncy” behavior. This means that when it hits a wall, the ball should reverse its direction. Note that this is one of the unusual cases where you control a sprite by a property.  The Gl_start   line contains a subtle but powerful command. It starts up the actual gameLib engine. This in turn starts up a special timer that repeats 20 times per second. This timer activates all the motion in your program.  T R I C K  If you want to have this type of behavior in your code without using the gameLib library, you should investigate the  setTimeOut   function supplied by both browsers. It is the underlying technology that the gameLib API uses to manage timed behavior.   213  C h a p t e r 9     S p r i t e A n m a t i o n  i     :   T h e R a c e r  Writing the HTML for the Moving Sprite Program The HTML is reasonably straightforward. It is a form with a set of command buttons on it. I used a table for neatness, and placed that table in a span object aligned to the right so it will stay out of the area in which the ball will move. Here’s the HTML for one row of the table.     <input type = "button"               value = "W&nbsp;&nbsp;"               onClick = "moveBall 270 ">     <input type = "button"               value = "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"               onClick = "moveBall 999 ">     <input type = "button"               value = "E&nbsp;&nbsp;"               onClick = "moveBall 90 ">                       All the buttons call the moveBall   function, but they pass a different parameter. You might recognize that west is 270 degrees and east is 90 degrees on a standard compass. The center button causes the ball to stop, so I encoded the special value 999, which usually would not be considered a valid direction.  Changing Speed and Direction The moveBall   function manipulates the ball sprite to make the animation occur. Following is the code for that function:  function moveBall direc {    if  direc == 999 {      ball.setSpeed 0 ;    } else {      ball.setSpeed 10 ;      ball.setXYdegs direc ;    }    end if  }    end moveBall  The direction value is stored in the parameter direc. The  first  thing  that  this  function  does  is  check whether  the  user  clicked  the  center  button.  If  so, the function sets the ball’s speed to 0, effectively stop- ping the ball. If the  direc value is anything other than 999, the function sets the ball’s XYdegs value to that direction and sets the ball’s speed to 10. The next time that the timer loop occurs  remember, this  IN THE REAL WORLD  Sprites  are  clearly  useful  in game  programming,  but  they can also be handy in any appli- cation  where  you  need  some kind of flashy movement or im- age swapping. If, for example, you’re  building  a  page  for  a courier  company,  you  can  in- corporate vans and aircraft that move across the screen as part of  the  page’s  navigation scheme.  If you are doing some sort of site for an engineering firm, you might feature a mov- ing parade of some of the parts the company produces.   214  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  happens 20 times per second , the function moves the ball approximately 10 pixels in the indicated direction.  H I N T  The capability to work with direction and speed is one of the most useful features of the sprite object. In game development, the direction and speed of a sprite are probably what you are most concerned about, but all the document object model gives you is the ability to set an element to a specified x,y coordinate. Without the sprite object, you would need to do some trigonometric conversions. The sprite object handles all the math necessary to convert a speed and direction into a pair of coordinates. This is pretty handy if your trig skills are a bit rusty.  Once the sprite is set up and the gameLib is started, movement is automatic. The ball pretty  much  moves  on  its  own,  bounces  when  it  hits  a  boundary,  and  responds  to button clicks from the user.  Using Frame Animation in Sprites If you wish to animate the movement of a ball, you can get away with only one image. However, if the image that you are working with is a car or other vehicle, you have to change the graphic when the direction changes; otherwise, the car will look silly. A vehicle usually goes in the direction of its nose, so it would be great to have some way to point the car in the current direction.  Creating the Moving Sprite Program The Moving Sprite program faces exactly this dilemma  see Figure 9.7 . The sprite is an arrow, and the arrow is always pointing in the direction in which the arrow is traveling.  FIGURE 9.7  The arrow is moving to the southeast and  pointed in that  direction.   Since the arrow is a sprite object, it has special methods that make it easy to choose one of a set of images.  Using Clip Graphics The gameLib library uses a special technique called graphic clipping. The best way to describe how this technique works is to look at the actual image file that is applied to the car sprite  see Figure 9.8 .  To create the illusion of an arrow that can go in all directions, you need eight different image files. You then display the appropriate image for the current direction. In Web programming, there is considerable overhead for each image that comes to the page. One large image is transferred more quickly than several smaller images. The clipping technique requires you to build a large composite image with all the component im- ages on it. When you attach an image to a sprite object, only a small part of the total image is shown. You can control which part of the image is visible. Although it sounds complicated, it is reasonably simple to use such an image once you have created it.  The  image  file  was  specially  prepared  for  use  as  a  sprite  image.  I  designed  the  car facing north as a 30×30 pixel image. I then made a copy, which I rotated by 45 degrees. I made a larger image that was 40 pixels tall by 320 pixels wide. I carefully placed the first  north  car image so it was centered at  20, 20  in the long skinny image. I then centered the next  northeast  car image at  40, 20  of the longer image. I repeated the process until I had all eight cardinal directions represented in the long image. I saved this image as car.gif. It is important that the smaller images are all the same distance apart, but the exact number of images does not matter.  215  C h a p t e r 9     S p r i t e A n m a t i o n  i     :   T h e R a c e r  FIGURE 9.8  The arrow image is  actually a set of eight images in  one file.   216  Setting Up Direction Variables This program starts with a set of variables to make things a little easier.  var arrow;  var NORTH = 0;  var NORTHEAST = 1;  var EAST = 2;  var SOUTHEAST = 3;  var SOUTH = 4;  var SOUTHWEST = 5;  var WEST = 6;  var NORTHWEST = 7;  var direction = EAST;  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  The  arrow  variable  will  hold  the  sprite.  The  capitalized  variables  will  be  used  for convenience, to hold the various directions. The directions correlate to the order of the arrow images in the graphic. The variable called direction holds the direction that the arrow sprite is currently facing.  Creating a Sprite with Frame Animation You need to change only one line of code in the initialization to deal with a sprite that uses frame animation.    arrow.setImage "arrow.gif", 30, 30, 8, 1 ;  function init  {    arrow = new Sp_Sprite  ;    arrow.moveTo 100,100 ;    arrow.setXlimits 0, 500 ;    arrow.setYlimits 0, 300 ;    arrow.setFrame 0 ;    arrow.switchOn  ;    arrow.setSpeed 0 ;    Gl_start  ;  }    end init  The only line that changes is the setImage   method of the sprite. In this case, the code specifies that the sprite’s image should be set to "sprite.gif". Recall that this image actually is 40×320 pixels, and it actually contains eight different arrow images. The next two parameters  30,  30  indicate the size at which the sprite should be drawn on the screen. The function will draw the sprite as a 30×30 square. The next parameter deter- mines how many frames are in the image. This number is set to 8, which indicates that the original image should be split into eight even pieces. In effect, the sprite will show only one-eighth of the original image at any one time, and it will show that piece of the image as a 30×30 square. You will use the last parameter  1  in the next chapter to add another element of animation. For now, leave the parameter’s value set to 1.   H I N T  I also turned off the bouncing feature, because I didn’t think it made sense for the arrow to bounce off the wall like a ball would.  Why not simply have eight different images? It might seem crazy to force all the small images into one long image, but it actually makes sense. First of all, because the im- ages are all related, it’s much easier to keep track of one image than eight. But the most important reason is efficiency. Every time that the browser has to load an image, there is a lot of overhead. The browser contacts the server, sends the image over the Internet, and closes the connection. Eight small images take much longer to download than one larger one. Also, all the image clipping will happen on an image that exists in the computer’s memory. This is much faster than swapping between multiple image files. Most browsers have a limited image cache and can keep very few images in memory. This means that if a lot of image swapping is going on, you could have even more network accesses slowing down the system. With the single-image technique, the im- age is entirely in memory.  Modifying the Direction Parameter The rest of the Moving Sprite program is also similar to the ball sprite program, with a few significant differences. Here’s the new version of the button code. The following HTML code listing shows only the middle row, but you should easily grasp what’s go- ing on from this portion of the HTML.  217  C h a p t e r 9     S p r i t e A n m a t i o n  i     :   T h e R a c e r     <input type = "button"               value = "W&nbsp;&nbsp;"               onClick = "moveArrow WEST ">     <input type = "button"               value = "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"               onClick = "moveArrow 999 ">     <input type = "button"               value = "E&nbsp;&nbsp;"               onClick = "moveArrow EAST ">                       This time, rather than specifying the new angle in degrees, I decided to specify the direction through the special constants that I had created. The center button still has the 999 value, because this button is still used to stop the arrow.  The moveCar   function manages the arrow’s direction and changes the frame so that the arrow image is pointing in the right direction.  function moveArrow direc {    if  direc == 999 {      arrow.setSpeed 0 ;    } else {   218  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i      arrow.setSpeed 3 ;      arrow.setXYdegs direc * 45 ;      arrow.setFrame direc ;    }    end if  }    end moveArrow  The setXYdegs   method changes the sprite’s direction based on the value of direc. I noticed that all the directions were multiples of 45 degrees, so I could use some simple math to correlate the 0–7 direction values to compass points. I also used the setFrame   method of the arrow sprite to set the frame to the number associated with the arrow’s direction. So, if the user clicks the west button, the value of direc will be WEST, which evaluates to 6. The function would set the arrow’s direction to 6 * 45, or 270 degrees. The sprite would load with the sixth frame, which shows the arrow pointing to the west.  Detecting Collision If sprites are moving around on the screen, they will eventually collide. Collision de- tection is an important element of game programming, because many of the events in a game are triggered by sprites bumping into each other. The sprite class provided by the gameLib API can detect collisions in a number of ways.  Creating the Collision Program To practice collision detection, you need to create something for your car sprite to crash into. Figures 9.9 and 9.10 show a variation of the Moving Sprite program, called Checking for Collisions.  I introduced another sprite, which I called barrier. This sprite is simply a big black box.  FIGURE 9.9  The car sprite works just as it did in the  last program.   219  C h a p t e r 9     S p r i t e A n m a t i o n  i     :   T h e R a c e r  FIGURE 9.10  When it hits the black box, the car stops.  Creating the Sprites The Checking for Collisions program has two sprites. One is the car  almost identical to the car in the previous program  and the other one is the barrier. Following is the code that sets up the sprites:    car.setImage "car.gif", 30, 30, 8, 1 ;  function init  {    car = new Sp_Sprite  ;    car.moveTo 100,100 ;    car.setXlimits 0, 500 ;    car.setYlimits 0, 300 ;    car.setFrame 0 ;    car.switchOn  ;    car.setSpeed 0 ;    car.collides = true;    barrier = new Sp_Sprite  ;    barrier.setImage "black.gif", 100, 100, 1, 1 ;    barrier.setXlimits 0, 500 ;    barrier.setYlimits 0, 300 ;    barrier.moveTo 200, 200 ;    barrier.setFrame 0 ;    barrier.switchOn  ;    barrier.collides = true;    Gl_hook "checkCollision  " ;   220    Gl_start  ;  }    end init  T R I C K  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Notice the use of the collides property in both sprites. I set this property to true in both the sprites so that they would register collisions.  The image for the barrier sprite is simply a 10×10 black square. I made a whole series of images of solid colors that are perfect for situations like this. Because the image is a solid color, it will size up very gracefully. It has a very small file size and will transfer quickly across the Internet. These little solid color images are great for normal HTML and game programming purposes, because you can easily use them to make a rectangle of any color. I also have an image that is simply a small transpar- ent gif image. This image is also useful if you want a spacer, such as we used to position the images in the basketball game in the last chapter, or a sprite that re- sponds to collisions but is not visible, such as a ghost or an invisible wall.  Hooking to the Timer Loop If you look closely, you’ll notice one other new line in the init   method. That line is as follows:  Gl_hook "checkCollision  " ;  Remember that when you call Gl_start  , you start a timer loop that occurs 20 times per second. This timer is used to manage sprite movement. The hook   method allows you to specify a function to run every time that the timer loop occurs. In this specific case, the method tells the library to run the checkCollision   function  which you will  see  shortly   every  time  that  the  timer  loop  occurs,  which  will  be  20  times  per second. Hooking functions to the timer in this way is the principal method for adding logic to your program in gameLib.  H I N T  If you have looked carefully at the gameLib documentation, you might have noticed that there is a way to do collision detection without hooking a function to the timer. The approach that this application demonstrates is not always the best choice. How- ever, because the ability to hook up functions is so important, I wanted to demonstrate at least one approach right away. Of course, you can always decide for yourself the best approach for creating your programs.  Creating the checkCollision   Function After you go through the trouble of hooking up a function, you have an obligation to write the function. Fortunately, the checkCollision   function is pretty simple.  function checkCollision  {    if  car.hasHit barrier  {      car.setSpeed 0 ;       Gl_unhook "checkCollision  " ;    }    end if  }    end checkCollision  The  hasHit   method of a sprite determines whether a car has hit whatever sprite is specified. This method always returns a Boolean value. If the car has hit the barrier in this iteration of the function, the value is returned as true. Otherwise, it returns as false.  When the car hits the barrier, you want to stop the car. To do so, you set its speed to 0 with the setSpeed   method.  Remember that the program calls the  checkCollision   function quite often. With the speed set to 0, the car continues hitting the barrier until it has changed direction and the speed has been changed to some other value. I found it best to unhook the checkCollision    function  temporarily  so  that  the  car  sprite  could  be  moved.  The Gl_unhook   function is used to stop calling the checkCollision   function each time that the timer ticks.  The  moveCar    function  in  this  program  has  been  modified  slightly,  to  rehook  the checkCollision   function whenever the car is pointed in a new direction:  221  C h a p t e r 9     S p r i t e A n m a t i o n  i     :   T h e R a c e r  function moveCar direc {    if  direc == 999 {      car.setSpeed 0 ;    } else {      Gl_hook "checkCollision  " ;      car.setSpeed 3 ;      car.setXYdegs direc * 45 ;      car.setFrame direc ;    }    end if  }    end moveCar  Of course, this is just a starting point. You could generate multiple barriers and do more complex collision detection.  Creating a Race Timer Sprites  and  collision-detection  techniques  provide  almost  all  of  the  functionality needed for the racing program except scorekeeping. It would be nice to have some way to keep track of how long the race lasts. JavaScript provides a Date object that helps with this task.  Writing the Timer Program Web browsers have ways of querying the system clock of the client machine to figure out the time. JavaScript supplies this information to the programmer via a special object called the Date object. Figure 9.11 shows a program that demonstrates the Date object in action.  The Timer program evaluates the current date, then evaluates each precise time that the user clicked the button. The program does some mathematical manipulations of these values to determine the elapsed time.   222  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 9.11  Each time that the  user clicks the button, the Timer  program adds to the  text area the  elapsed time since the browser loaded  the page.  Using the Date Object The key to this program is the timer object built into JavaScript.  Following is the code for the program:  var startTime = new Date  ;  var startInt = startTime.getTime  ;  var elapsedTime = new Date  ;  var currentTime = new Date  ;  function getTime  {    var output = "";    currentTime = new Date  ;    var currentInt = currentTime.getTime  ;    var elapsedInt = currentInt - startInt;    elapsedTime = new Date elapsedInt ;    output += elapsedTime.getMinutes   + ":";    output += elapsedTime.getSeconds   + ".";    output += elapsedTime.getMilliseconds   + "\n";    document.myForm.txtOutput.value += output;  }    end getTime  You invoke the Date object with new Date  . This function creates a new Date object based on the current time. The Date object has a number of interesting methods and properties, which Table 9.3 lists.  The Date object is usually used simply to get the current date from the system. Here’s a simple script, embedded in the HTML code, that uses the Date object in a more typical way.   223  C h a p t e r 9     S p r i t e A n m a t i o n  i     :   T h e R a c e r  TABLE 9.3 KEY PROPERTIES AND METHODS OF THE DATE OBJECT  new Date integer   Method  new Date    getTime    getDate    Example  Description Creates a Date object based var myDate = new Date  ; on the current date and time. Creates a new Date object based on the integer passed. new Date intValue ; Returns the number of milliseconds since midnight GMT, as an integer. Returns the day of the month. alert myDate.  myDate.getTime;  var myDate =  var myInt =  getMonth    Returns the month.  getDate   ;  alert  "today is the "  + myDate.getDate   +  " of " + myDate.  getMonth   ;  getYear    getHours    Returns the year that corresponds with this Date object. Returns the hour of the day.  getMinutes    Returns the minutes.  getSeconds    Returns the seconds.  alert myDate.  getYear   ;  alert myDate.  getHours   ;  alert myDate.  getMinutes   ;  alert myDate.  getSeconds   ;  toString    Returns the entire date as a string value.  alert myDate.  toString   ;  document.write new Date   ;        This code is embedded directly into the HTML code and generates a Date object imme- diately. The value of that Date object is translated to the Web page as a long string.  IN THE REAL WORLD  The ability to deal with dates and times is very important in many aspects of programming. You might use similar techniques to determine how long it has been since the user last visited your site, or you might want to be able to calculate a person’s age in years, months, and days. Of course, it’s nice to just be able to display the current date and time in whatever format you wish.   224  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Dealing with Elapsed Time For the Racer game, you will not need the date or time of day, but the elapsed time between the start and end of a race. This is not difficult to do, but it requires that you understand how the Date object really works.  The date is actually stored as a very long integer that counts how many milliseconds  1,000th of a second  have occurred since midnight Greenwich Mean Time  GMT . The Date object is basically just a series of methods that extract more useful information  such as the month, day, or hour  from that big integer.  The getTime   method returns the actual number that relates to the time. This num- ber  wouldn’t  seem  very  useful,  except  that  you  can  subtract  the  integer  value  two times. The result gives you an integer that can be translated to a date value. You can count the minutes, seconds, and milliseconds of this new Date object to get an elapsed time. Here’s how I got the elapsed time:  Outside the method, I created startTime and elapsedTime as new Date objects.  The program calls the getTime   function each time that the user wants to find a new elapsed time. The first thing that the function does is reinitialize  elapsedTime as a new  Date object so that it will have a different value than  startTime  whose value indicates when the browser loaded the page .  The following two lines get integer values related to the two Date objects:   var startInt = startTime.getTime  ;   var currentInt = currentTime.getTime  ;  The following line creates a new integer by subtracting the millisecond value of startInt from that of currentInt:  Finally, I use a set of date methods to get other useful values from the Date object:  var elapsedInt = currentInt - startInt;  The next line creates a new date based on the difference.  elapsedTime = new Date elapsedInt ;    output += elapsedTime.getMinutes   + ":";    output += elapsedTime.getSeconds   + ".";    output += elapsedTime.getMilliseconds   + "\n";    document.myForm.txtOutput.value += output;  Returning to the Racer Program The Racer program is primarily a combination of the techniques described through- out this chapter. It relies heavily on sprite technology. The program actually features 11  different  sprites,  and  you  can  easily  customize  it  to  use  more  if  you  want  more complex tracks. The basic organization of the program relies on a sprite for the car, an array of sprites for barriers, and another array of sprites for time sensors. The barriers are placed on the track to make the different track designs, and the sensors are placed   225  C h a p t e r 9     S p r i t e A n m a t i o n  i     :   T h e R a c e r  around the track. The program considers a lap complete only when the car has trig- gered all five time sensors.  Creating the CarStart Page The initial page for the Racer program uses a now-familiar strategy. This page contains the Help screen and a button that calls up the actual page.  Writing the HTML for Car.html The HTML for the page is very simple, because most of the work happens with sprites. The body calls the init   function, and all the user interaction is done with an image map.  <body bgColor = "gray"        onload = "init  ">                             <AREA SHAPE="POLY" COORDS="303,395,325,403,342,424,344,448,335,468,317,482, 307,485,301,485" HREF="javaScript:turnRight  ">  <AREA SHAPE="POLY" COORDS="299,396,280,400,261,418,255,440,259,461,270,475, 288,485,299,486" HREF="javascript:turnLeft  ">        Creating an Image Map for User Input An image map is one way to get input from the user without having to use form con- trols. I wanted the user to interact with a steering wheel and control pedals, so I drew them in an image and created an HTML image map. If you are working with simple regions  such as rectangles , you can build image maps by hand; however, for more complex images, you may want to use an editor. The CD-ROM that accompanies this book  includes  The  GIMP,  a  powerful,  free  image  editor   see  Figure  9.12 .  I  used  the image map tool that comes with The GIMP to generate the image map automatically for  this  program.  The  image  map  tool  is  available  by  right-clicking  an  image,  then choosing Filters, Web, then Image Map.  Note that instead of specifying a normal URL, I called the turnLeft   function by set- ting JavaScript:turnLeft   as the URL for this region.  The image map editor creates a text file that you can copy and paste into your page.   226  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 9.12  Defining an image map in The GIMP.           var car;  Using Libraries and Variables The car program is reasonably complex, and it has a number of variables. It is also not surprising that it uses the gameLib core and sprite libraries. Here is the code that sets up the program:           var barrier = new Array  ;  var numSensors = 5;  var timeSensor = new Array numSensors ;  var lapStatus = new Array numSensors ;  var NORTH = 0;  var NORTHEAST = 1;  var EAST = 2;  var SOUTHEAST = 3;  var SOUTH = 4;   227  C h a p t e r 9     S p r i t e A n m a t i o n  i     :   T h e R a c e r  var SOUTHWEST = 5;  var WEST = 6;  var NORTHWEST = 7;  var direction = EAST;  var speed = 3;  var startTime = new Date  ;  var trackNum = 1;  var lap = 0;  The car is a sprite, just like the one used earlier in this chapter. Additionally, the pro- gram sets up an array of barriers  which will be sprites  and an array of time sensors  which will also be sprites . Another array is used to keep track of the car’s position on the screen. These arrays make the game flexible, because you can place the barriers and time sensors anywhere on the screen and the program will be able to tell whether the car has completed a lap. A set of variables is used to manage the directions, just as in the program earlier in the chapter.  The code initializes the direction to EAST, sets the starting speed to 3, and establishes a new startTime  which is useful for determining the elapsed time later . Finally, the code sets the track number to 1  so that the user starts with the easiest track  and sets the lap to 0.  Creating the init   Function The program calls the init   function when the page’s body loads. It is chiefly con- cerned with initializing sprites. Here’s the code:  function init  {    car = new Sp_Sprite  ;    car.setImage "car.gif", 40, 40, 8, 1 ;    car.moveTo 30,40 ;    car.setXlimits 20, 600 ;    car.setYlimits 30, 400 ;    car.setFrame EAST ;    car.setZ 99 ;    car.switchOn  ;    car.setSpeed 3 ;    car.setXYdegs EAST * 45 ;    car.collides = true;      set up barriers    var barCounter = 0;    for barCounter = 0; barCounter < 5; barCounter++ {      barrier[barCounter] = new Sp_Sprite  ;      barrier[barCounter].setXlimits 20, 600 ;      barrier[barCounter].setYlimits 30, 400 ;      barrier[barCounter].setImage "black.gif", 20,20,1,1 ;   228  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i      barrier[barCounter].moveTo 10,10 ;      barrier[barCounter].setFrame 0 ;      barrier[barCounter].switchOn  ;      barrier[barCounter].collides = true;    }    end for loop      set up time sensors    for  tsCount = 0; tsCount < numSensors; tsCount++ {      timeSensor[tsCount] = new Sp_Sprite  ;      timeSensor[tsCount].setImage "white.gif", 10, 10, 1, 1       timeSensor[tsCount].setXlimits 20, 600 ;      timeSensor[tsCount].setYlimits 30, 400 ;      timeSensor[tsCount].moveTo 10,10 ;      timeSensor[tsCount].setFrame 0 ;      timeSensor[tsCount].switchOn  ;      timeSensor[tsCount].collides = true;    }    end for loop    Gl_hook "checkCollision  " ;    Gl_start  ;    setUpTrack  ;  }    end init  The program sets up the car sprite. This setup should be very familiar now. The only new technique is the setZ   method. Notice that the program sets the z value of the car to 99. This setting tells the system to display the car as if it were on top of every- thing else. All sprites with lower z values will appear to be underneath the car if they happen to be drawn in the same place.  The array includes five barriers. The program initially sets up each one to be exactly the same, although the program will move them later. For convenience, all the barrier creation is done in a for loop.  The code also includes an array of five time sensors. These are simply sprites that the player is to drive over. You’ll place them all over the track later so that the driver can’t cheat by driving over the start line, then turning around and driving over the start line again to finish. The program also initializes the time sensors in a for loop for convenience.  I hooked the  checkCollision   function to the timer loop so that the program will call the function frequently. I also started up the gameLib engine with Gl_start  .  The last line of init   is a call to the setUpTrack   function, which is described next.  Writing the setUpTrack   Function The setUpTrack   function examines the value of the trackNum variable and sets up the track in one of three configurations. To add or modify tracks, you can simply change this function. Here’s the code:   229  C h a p t e r 9     S p r i t e A n m a t i o n  i     :   T h e R a c e r  function setUpTrack  {      preset for a specific track    switch trackNum {      case 1:           oval        barrier[0].resize 400, 200 ;        barrier[0].moveTo 100, 110 ;        barrier[1].resize 400, 200 ;        barrier[1].moveTo 100, 110 ;        barrier[2].resize 400, 200 ;        barrier[2].moveTo 100, 110 ;        barrier[3].resize 400, 200 ;        barrier[3].moveTo 100, 110 ;        barrier[4].resize 400, 200 ;        barrier[4].moveTo 100, 110 ;        timeSensor[0].resize 10, 80 ;        timeSensor[0].moveTo 100, 30 ;        timeSensor[1].resize 10, 80 ;        timeSensor[1].moveTo 300, 30 ;        timeSensor[2].resize 90, 10 ;        timeSensor[2].moveTo 500, 200 ;        timeSensor[3].resize 10, 80 ;        timeSensor[3].moveTo 300,310 ;        timeSensor[4].resize 70, 10 ;        timeSensor[4].moveTo 30, 200 ;        break;  . . .   other track definitions  }    end switch    resetStatus  ;    alert "ready?" ;    lap = 0;    startTime = new Date  ;  }    end setUpTrack  To save space, I showed only the portion of this code that creates the first track. See the code on the CD-ROM for the other track descriptions.  You create new tracks by changing the size and location of the barrier and time sensor sprites. The first track is very simple, so I put all the barriers in the same place. Notice how the track sensors are placed around the track to ensure that the player has to complete  the  entire  circuit  to  be  credited  for  a  lap.  After  the  track  is  set  up,  the resetStatus   function cleans up the lap counter  for details and a description of that function, see the section “Writing the resetStatus   Function” . An alert statement   gives the player an opportunity to start the program when he or she is ready. Finally, the setUpTrack   function resets the startTime variable to the current time.  Building the checkCollision   Function The checkCollision   function checks for collisions with the barriers and the time sensors. If a barrier collision occurs, the function stops the car. The time sensor code calls the lapFinished   function to check whether the car has hit each sensor. If the lap is finished and the sensor that was hit is sensor 0  the start-finish line , the func- tion calls the showTime   and resetStatus   functions to display the time and reset the sensor counter. Here’s the checkCollision   function’s code:  function checkCollision  {    var newDir;      check for crashes    for  barCounter = 0; barCounter < 5; barCounter++ {      if  car.hasHit barrier[barCounter]  {        Gl_unhook "checkCollision  " ;        newDir = Math.floor Math.random   * 7 ;        speed = 0;  230  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i          direction = newDir;        car.setSpeed speed ;          car.setXYdegs direction ;          car.setFrame direction ;      }    end if    }    end for loop      check for sensors    for  tsCount = 0; tsCount < 5; tsCount++ {      if  car.hasHit timeSensor[tsCount]  {        if lapFinished   {          if  car.hasHit timeSensor[0]  {            showTime  ;            resetStatus  ;          }    end 'start gate' if        }   end 'finished' if        lapStatus[tsCount] = 1;      }    end ' hit sensor' if    }    end for loop  }    end checkCollision   231  C h a p t e r 9     S p r i t e A n m a t i o n  i     :   T h e R a c e r  Creating the lapFinished   Function The  lapFinished   function checks the  lapStatus array to see whether all the ele- ments of the array have been turned on, which indicates that the car has hit every sensor at least once. If so, the function returns the value true; otherwise, it returns the value false. The code follows:  function lapFinished  {    var finished = true;    for  counter=0; counter < numSensors; counter++ {      if  lapStatus[counter] == 0 {        finished = false;      }    end if    }    end loop    return finished;  }    end lapFinished  Writing the resetStatus   Function The resetStatus   function resets the value of the lapStatus array to all 0s. The pro- gram calls the function at the beginning of each lap. Here’s the code:  function resetStatus  {    for  tsCount = 0; tsCount < numSensors; tsCount++ {      lapStatus[tsCount] = 0;    }    end for loop  }    end resetStatus  Building the showTime   Function The showTime   function calculates the elapsed time for the current race and displays that time on the screen. It also checks for the lap number; if the car is on the last lap, the function displays the race time. The program then moves on to the next track. The code for the showTime   function is as follows:  function showTime  {      returns back the time from this lap.    var currentTime = new Date  ;    var currentInt = currentTime.getTime  ;    var startInt = startTime.getTime  ;    var elapsedInt =  currentInt - startInt;    var elapsedTime = new Date elapsedInt ;    lap++;    var output = "";   Creating the turnLeft   and turnRight   Functions The turnLeft   and turnRight   functions manipulate the direction variable in response to the user’s mouse clicks on the steering wheel. The program sets the car’s direction and image based on the new value of direction. Here’s the code for these functions:  232  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i    output += elapsedTime.getMinutes   + ":";    output += elapsedTime.getSeconds   + ".";    output += elapsedTime.getMilliseconds  ;    window.status = output;    if  lap==5 {      alert output ;      trackNum++;      if  trackNum > 3 {        trackNum = 1;      }    end if      setUpTrack  ;    }    end if  }    end showTime  function turnLeft  {    direction--;    if  direction < NORTH {      direction = NORTHWEST;    }    end if    car.setXYdegs direction * 45 ;    car.setFrame direction ;  }    end turnLeft  function turnRight  {    direction++;    if  direction > NORTHWEST {      direction = NORTH;    }    end if    car.setXYdegs direction * 45 ;    car.setFrame direction ;  }    end turnRight  Writing the decell   Function The decell   function decrements the speed of the car, as follows:  function decell  {    speed--;   233  C h a p t e r 9     S p r i t e A n m a t i o n  i     :   T h e R a c e r  the accell   Function The  acell    function  rehooks  the  checkCollision    function   in  case  the  car  had crashed into a barrier  and increases the car’s speed:    if  speed < 0 {      speed = 0;    }    end if    car.setSpeed speed ;  }    end decell  function acell  {    Gl_hook "checkCollision  " ;    car.collides = true;    speed++;    if  speed > 10 {      speed = 10;    }    end if    car.setSpeed speed ;  }    end accell  Summary In this chapter, you learned how you can use an Application Programming Interface  API  to simplify greatly the process of writing cross-browser dynamic HTML. Specifi- cally, you learned how to set up the gameLib core library and the sprite module. You learned how to create and use sprites, add motion, and detect collisions. You also learned how to check elapsed time using the built-in Date object. You then put all these things together in a program that you can easily modify and improve.  E X E R C I S E S  1. Add another track to the Racer program. Modify the setUpTrack   function so it has a fourth track, and set the values of the barriers and time sensors to build a totally new track configuration.  2. Improve the sprite images to make your own car, better-looking barriers and sensors, or  an entirely different theme.  3. Write a track editor so the user can edit tracks in the racing game. You might use a form to let the user type in the location and size of each barrier and time sensor, then display how the track will look with these options.  4. Make a simple version of Pacman. Define a path with barriers, and build a sprite to travel  on the path.  5. Add ghosts to your version of the Pacman game.    C H A P T E R  10  Using Other  gameLib Features: The Dogfight Game  Sprite graphics are a very powerful tool.  With a few more enhancements, you are well on your way to building sophisti- cated 2-D games. In this chapter, you will learn about some of the other great tools that gameLib gives you for building better games. Specifically, you will learn how to do the following:    Build multiplayer games    Trap keyboard events    Manage sound    Generate layers    Add missiles    Improve your animations   The Project: The Dogfight Game To demonstrate these features, you will build a simple two-player arcade game. The game is simple: Two players sit at the same keyboard and control little biplanes. The players try to blast each other out of the sky. Figures 10.1 and 10.2 show the game’s interface.  The game has a number of interesting features that might not all be apparent from the screenshots.  236  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 10.1  Two planes enjoying a blissful afternoon.  FIGURE 10.2  Take that, Red Baron!   237  C h a p t e r   1 0     U s i n g O t h e r   g a m e L i b   F e a t u r e s     :   T h e D o g f i g h t    G a m e  First, this is a two-player game. Although it might seem that writing a game for two players is more difficult than writing one for a single player, this is not always the case. The hard- est part of “player versus the computer” style games is developing the artificial intelli- gence for the computer player. With a two-player game, this is not a problem, as the com- puter does not need to store any strategies, but simply respond to two sets of input.  The game uses keyboard input. Both versions of the  document object model provide techniques to read mouse and keyboard events, but these two models are  surprise  very different in the browser implementations. The gameLib API provides a simpler multibrowser interface, which makes managing keystrokes reasonably straightforward. Keyboard input provides a much smoother type of input for many types of games than the techniques that you have used previously in this book.  H I N T  Because JavaScript is an Internet technology, you might be tempted to write a two- player game with the players on different computers. Sadly, JavaScript does not have the communication functions to enable you to accomplish this. You would prob- ably need a language like Java to write multicomputer games.  The Dogfight game features sound effects when the players shoot at each other and when they score hits. The gameLib library encapsulates the techniques demonstrated in Chapter 8, “Dynamic HTML: The Stealth Submarine,” for generating sound. You might recall from the chapter that generating sound can be quite challenging, but it is rea- sonably easy using gameLib.  To create the Dogfight game’s documentation and scorekeeping parts of the game, I used gameLib layers. A layer is gameLib’s way of specifying an object such as a Netscape layer or CSS element. In fact, you will see that with liberal use of layer and sprite ob- jects, you can write the entire program as a series of gameLib objects. The HTML in the program is almost nonexistent.  You will notice some new animation techniques in the Dogfight game. The planes can shoot bullets, and if you look very carefully, you will note that the propellers appear to spin.  Using Layers and the Keyboard Begin your tour of the new gameLib features by looking at a program that demon- strates keyboard input and gameLib layers. Figure 10.3 shows the program’s interface.  The program traps for the A, B, and C keys. The yellow box is a layer. Its content can be changed dynamically, and it appears to be part of the original page.  Setting Up the Program As usual, you will begin by importing gameLib modules and setting up some variables.        <script language = "Javascript" src=".. gamelib196 gamelib  gamelib_keyboard.js">   238  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 10.3  When the user  presses the A key, the letter A appears  in a yellow box.        var display;  var a;  var b;  var c;  I first added the gamelib_core library, and also added the keyboard module. There is not a separate module for layers. Layer handling is done as a part of the core module.  The four variables will all hold various components of the program. The display vari- able will contain a reference to the layer. The a, b, and c variables refer to each keystroke that I intend to trap.  You’ll learn more about trapping keystrokes in a moment.   Creating a Layer A layer is an object in gameLib, so it is set up like most other objects in JavaScript.  function init  {       Keyboard and Layer Demo       Andy Harris      set up display    display = new Gl_layer 350, 200, 100, "" ;    display.setBgcolor "yellow" ;    display.show  ;   239  C h a p t e r   1 0     U s i n g O t h e r   g a m e L i b   F e a t u r e s     :   T h e D o g f i g h t    G a m e  The new Gl_layer   command generates a new layer object. The first two parameters refer to the starting location of the layer. The next parameter  100  refers to the start- ing width of the layer. The starting height of the layer will be defined when something is added to the layer or when the layer is explicitly resized. The last parameter is the HTML text of the layer. This can be a variable containing an entire HTML page or actual HTML text, or you can leave the variable blank and fill it in later.  H I N T  Is this layer a Netscape layer, a gameLib layer, or a CSS element? The short answer is yes; it’s a combination of all these things. To simplify coding, Scott Porter  the author of gameLib  defined a new object called a Gl_layer, which encapsulates the best features of both the Netscape and IE approaches to positionable elements. It is conve- nient to call this new element a layer, but keep in mind that it is not exactly like the two types of layering objects defined in the browser Document Object Models. Fortu- nately, gamLib’s layer object seems to be much better behaved than either of the other layer objects, especially when used across browser platforms.  The gamLib layer object is a very intriguing little monster. Table 10.1 lists the most commonly used methods of the layer object.  TABLE 10.1 COMMON METHODS OF THE LAYER OBJECT  Method  new Gl_layer x, y,  width, startingHTML   Description Creates a new layer at  x, y  that is width pixels wide and contains the startingHTML as its body. .load  filename, type  Loads the specified file into  the layer. If type is set to true, the file will be always be loaded from the server. Moves the layer’s top-left corner to the specified pixels. Resizes the layer to the specified size. Sets the boundaries for the layer. This method works as it does in the sprite library. Replaces the content of the layer with newHTML. Sets the layer’s background to a specified color. Makes the layer visible.  .moveTo x, y   .resizeTo x, y   .setXlimits a, b ,  setYlimits a, b   .write newHTML   .setBgcolor color   .show    Example  var myLayer = new  Gl_layer  0, 0, 100,  " Hi there! " ;  myLayer.load   "instructions.html",  true ;  myLayer.moveTo   100, 200 ;  myLayer.resizeTo   50, 50 ;  myLayer.setXlimits   0, 500 ; myLayer.  setYlimits 0, 300 ;  myLayer.write   " Whoo Hoo! " ;  myLayer.setBgcolor   "red" ;  myLayer.show  ;   IN THE REAL WORLD  The  layer  object  is  useful  any time  you  want  to  have  a  dy- namic part of the screen. I have used layers in a catalog program that  displayed  parts  of  a  small database. You could use layers in a menu system for your Web page or as an easy way to add dynamic content  such as a mes- sage of the day .  In game development, layers are great for text that you want to place precisely on the screen. It is much easier to get a good screen layout with layers than it is using plain HTML formatting. Also, the ability to access the write   method of layers makes them great tools for communicating with the user. It’s common  to  use  layers  for  scorekeeping,  help screens, or any other place where you might want to place dynamic text.  In the Keyboard and Layer Demo program, I set up display as a new layer at position  300, 200  with a starting width of 100 pixels and no beginning text. I then set the background color of the layer to yel- low and showed it. The layer object is not automatically shown until you invoke its show   method.  Creating Keyboard Handler Objects The  gameLib  approach  to  keyboard  handling  simplifies  the  process  of  getting  user input from the keyboard. The key  pun intended  is the trapkey   method. Look at the rest of the init   function to see how this approach works:  240  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i    set up keyboard traps    a = Kb_trapkey "a" ;    b = Kb_trapkey "b" ;    c = Kb_trapkey "c" ;      start up program:    Gl_hook "mainLoop  " ;    Gl_start  ;  }    end  You probably noticed that the init   function initializes the a, b, and c variables by calling the Kb_trapkey   function. This function generates an instance of the key han- dler object. Table 10.2 lists the commands by which you control these objects.  Generally, you initialize keystrokes in some type of initialization function  as I have done in this program  and check whether the user has pressed the key in some type of main loop procedure.  Responding to Keystrokes If the user presses the a, b, or c key, the program should display the appropriate value in the yellow layer. Here’s the code for the main loop:  function mainLoop  {    var letter = "";   241  C h a p t e r   1 0     U s i n g O t h e r   g a m e L i b   F e a t u r e s     :   T h e D o g f i g h t    G a m e    var message = "";    if a.pressed {      letter = "A";    }    end if    if b.pressed {      letter = "B";    }    end if    if Kb_lastkey == c {      letter = "C";    }    end if    message =  "<font color = Blue";    message += "      size = 7>";    message += letter    message += " ";    display.write message ;  }    end mainLoop  The function starts by setting up two utility variables. letter will contain one charac- ter denoting the value of a keypress. The message variable will contain a simple HTML document that the program will send to the display layer.  TABLE 10.2 KEYBOARD HANDLER COMMANDS  Command .pressed  read-only   Description Returns true if the user is currently pressing the key.  Example  if  myKey.pressed   {   alert "A" ; }     end if  Kb_trapkey keyName   myKey = Kb_trapKey "a" ;  Sets up a new key object that responds when the user presses keyName. Contains a reference to the last key pressed.  Kb_lastkey  if  Kb_lastkey ==  myKey {   alert "A" ; }     end if   242  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  The function looks at a and b using the .pressed method.  Remember that this func- tion has been hooked to the timer loop, so it executes 20 times per second.  If the user is currently pressing the a or b key, the value of letter changes. Just for demon- stration purposes, I used the Kb_lastkey technique to determine whether the user had pressed the c key.  T R A P  The underlying JavaScript routines can trap only for normal keyboard characters. You cannot  yet  use this technique to trap for arrow keys, function keys, or other special keys on the keyboard. Also, this routine does not distinguish between up- percase and lowercase characters. For most game development purposes, the ca- pabilities of the JavaScript routines are sufficient.  IN THE REAL WORLD  Developers  sometimes  use keyboard  handling  as  an  error- detection scheme. For example, you might want to ensure that a text  box  contains  no  numeric characters. Also, you can use key- board handling as a control tech- nique on certain kinds of appli- cations. For example, I wrote a program that generates presen- tations with several slides on one long HTML page. I set up the n key to move to the next slide, and p to go to the previous slide.  After a value has been assigned to the letter variable, the rest of the mainLoop   function involves build- ing an HTML string and writing it to the display layer using the display.write   method.  This is a unique approach to keyboard handling. The keyboard-handling technique used in gameLib is  terrific  for  game  development.  In  this  type  of programming, developers usually use keystrokes to control  a  sprite  or  send  other  very  quick  signals from the user to the program. However, if you use other languages  including the JavaScript code on which the gameLib libraries were based , the algo- rithm used is a little bit different. Most languages have some sort of function or method that looks at the entire keyboard, determines which key has been pressed,  then  returns  some  type  of  integer  code relating to the keypress. The programmer then ana- lyzes  this  code  to  determine  what  has  happened and writes corresponding code.  Adding Sound You might recall that sound can be challenging because of the completely different approaches  that  the  major  browsers  take  to  embedding  sound  in  Web  pages.  The gameLib API provides a very easy interface to sound programming in JavaScript.  Creating the Sound Demo Program Figure 10.4 shows a simple program that demonstrates the basic sound features in gameLib. The program features two sound effects that are controlled by buttons on the Web page. The user can start and stop a music file, or play a sound effect, by click- ing the appropriate buttons.  The process of using sounds follows a pattern that you’ve seen a few times now: You import a special module of the API, create variables that refer to sound objects, then manipulate methods and properties of the sound objects.   243  C h a p t e r   1 0     U s i n g O t h e r   g a m e L i b   F e a t u r e s     :   T h e D o g f i g h t    G a m e  FIGURE 10.4  The Sound Demo program lets the user play a sound effect, as well as start and stop a  music file.           var sndBang;  var sndMusic;  function init  {  Creating a Sound Object The sound object is created through a function of the sound library. Here’s the startup code for the Sound Demo program:          sndBang = new Sd_add_sound "bang.wav" ;    sndMusic = new Sd_add_sound "canyon.mid" ;  }    end init  I created variables for two sounds, sndBang and sndMusic. Then I used the Sd_add_sound   method to generate sound objects to assign to the two variables. Table 10.3 lists the key characteristics of the sound object.  The sound object can use either .wav files or .midi files. Generally, .wav files are used for sound effects, and .midi files are used for background music. You can find plenty of sounds on the Internet, although you should get permission of the file’s owner before using the sound file in your game.   TABLE 10.3 COMMONLY USED METHODS OF THE SOUND OBJECT  Method  Sd_add_sound   fileName   .play    .stop    Description Generates a new sound object based on fileName, which is a .wav or .midi file. Plays the sound. Stops playing the sound.  Example  var mySound =  Sd_add_sound   "bang.wav" ;  mySound.play  ;  mySound.stop  ;  Playing and Stopping Sounds Once you have created a sound object, it is very simple to start and stop the sound effect. Here’s the rest of the code for the Sound Demo program.  244  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i            Sound Demo    <input type = button         value = "bang"         onclick = "sndBang.play  ">  <input type = button         value = "start music"         onClick = "sndMusic.play  ">  <input type = button         value = "stop music"         onClick = "sndMusic.stop  ">              Because the code is so basic, I integrated it directly into the HTML. Of course, you can also use the sound object’s play   and stop   methods inside more traditional code.  Improving Sprite Management Using the keyboard to control a sprite’s behavior is one obvious way to spruce up your games. There are some other things that you can do to make your game much more interesting. The Simple Plane Demo program is a simple prototype of the bi- plane game that illustrates how to add keyboard input, as well as a few other new features of sprite objects.   245  C h a p t e r   1 0     U s i n g O t h e r   g a m e L i b   F e a t u r e s     :   T h e D o g f i g h t    G a m e  FIGURE 10.5  The program  presents a basic  airplane with  keyboard control and a rotating  propeller.  Creating the Simple Plane Program Figure 10.5 shows this reasonably simple program, which demonstrates a number of new techniques.  Using a Sprite as a Background Image The background image is actually a sprite with a cloud image set as its only image. There are a number of reasons that you might want to use a sprite as a background:    If you set the z value of the sprite very low, all other sprites will pass over it.   It is much easier to position a sprite than it is to position a normal HTML image.   If you wish, you can have multiple frames of the image to create an animated  background, or perhaps a series of different backgrounds  for example, you could add a morning sky with a red background, or a night sky with stars .    You can use the clipping methods of the sprite object to support scrolling back-  grounds. Check the gameLib sprite documentation for information on using clipping.  The beginning code of the Simple Plane Demo program follows. Most of this code is very familiar. Take a look at the cloud sprite code. The program uses this sprite as a background graphic.  T R I C K  To get a nice cloud texture, I used a fractal pattern generator in my image program, then tuned it up with a feathered brush. This is a pretty easy way to generate certain natural patterns, such as clouds, waves, and certain types of mountains. Look in the documentation of your image editing software for information about any special effects tools that might be useful for game graphics.   var plane;  var clouds;  var upKey;  var downKey;  var NORTH = 0;  var NORTHEAST = 1;  var EAST = 2;  var SOUTHEAST = 3;  var SOUTH = 4;  var SOUTHWEST = 5;  var WEST = 6;  var NORTHWEST = 7;  var direction = EAST;  function init  {    Sp_xoffset=100;    Sp_yoffset=100;  246  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i    clouds = new Sp_Sprite  ;    clouds.setImage "clouds.gif", 500, 300, 1, 1 ;    clouds.moveTo 0,0 ;    clouds.setXlimits 0, 500 ;    clouds.setYlimits 0, 300 ;    clouds.setFrame 0 ;    clouds.switchOn  ;  The plane and clouds variables both contain sprites. upKey and downKey will hold key- board handlers. The direction constants should be familiar from Chapter 9, “Sprite Animation: The Racer,”as should the direction variable.  The  Sp_xoffset and  Sp_yoffset variables are special variables used in the sprite li- brary. By giving values to these variables, you can specify a new origin for all sprites. This approach can be very useful for centering your game on the screen. All the other code in this segment sets up the clouds as normal sprites.  Creating a More Involved Animation Graphic If you run the Simple Plane Demo program and look carefully at the biplane, you will notice that the propeller appears to spin. Now there are two versions of each plane picture: one picture of an airplane pointing east with a large propeller, and another picture that is identical, but the airplane has a smaller propeller. The program swaps quickly between these versions of the image to give the illusion of a moving propeller.   247  C h a p t e r   1 0     U s i n g O t h e r   g a m e L i b   F e a t u r e s     :   T h e D o g f i g h t    G a m e  FIGURE 10.6  Now there are two  images of the biplane for each  direction.  This illusion is accomplished by another trick of the sprite object. Figure 10.6 shows the actual aircraft picture in the graphics editor.  Note that I increased the size of the graphic and added a blue background to make the image easier to see.   Recall that sprites can have several frames, even though they have only one image. The gameLib  API  accomplishes  this  feat  by  clipping  the  image  into  a  number  of  evenly sized frames. In the last chapter, you created an image with eight frames by generating a graphic with eight evenly spaced images in a row. You can also specify another kind of animation by swapping a number of images within a frame. If you arrange your sprite graphic as I did here, you can animate each frame very easily. Just remember that each column represents the animations in a particular frame. Generally your code will explicitly set the frame, but you will automate the animations within the frame.  H I N T  Although I chose to have only two animations per frame, you can have as many as you wish. In fact, you are not required to have the same number of animations in each frame. See the gameLib documentation for details on how you control differing lengths of animations.  Incorporating Frame Animation If you look back at the init   function for the Simple Plane Demo program, you will see the plane sprite definition:   248  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i    plane = new Sp_Sprite  ;    plane.setImage "plane1.gif", 20,20,8,2 ;    plane.moveTo 0,100 ;    plane.setSpeed 3 ;    plane.setXYdegs 90 ;    plane.setXlimits 0, 500 ;    plane.setYlimits 0, 300 ;    plane.bounces=false;    plane.setFrame direction ;    plane.setAnimationSpeed 3, "forward" ;    plane.collides = true;    plane.switchOn  ;  This code looks very much like the car code from Chapter 9, but there are a couple of subtle differences that involve animation. First, note the difference in the setImage   method. The program instructs the sprite to use the plane1.gif image, size it to 20, 20, and use 8×2 frames. If you compare this to the actual image, you will see that these parameters should allow the display of eight different frames with two cells of anima- tion apiece. You must ensure that the number of images used in the graphic is the same as that referenced in the setImage   method. If the number of images is not the same as the value in the setImage   method call, the program will still work, but it will look very strange.  H I N T  To simplify this discussion, I will refer to the row of elements as frames manipu- lated by the .setFrame   method  and the columns as cells manipulated by the setAnimation   method .  The other new effect is the  setAnimationSpeed   method call. This method of the sprite object takes two parameters. The first is the number of cycles to hold a cell on the screen. I set the value to 3, so each piece of the animation is visible for .15 sec- onds, which means that the propeller image changes about six times a second. If you set a larger value here, the image will animate more slowly. Smaller values cause the sprite to animate more quickly. The second parameter must contain the string "forward" or  the  string  "back".  This  parameter  determines  whether  the  animation  will  run forward or backward.  The library automatically animates all the images that you have set in the column, unless you instruct it to do otherwise.  Table 10.4 describes the sprite animation commands that are available.  Adding Keyboard Input The remainder of the code in the init   function handles creating keyboard handlers and starting up the gameLib engine:      enable keyboard handling    upKey = Kb_trapkey "v" ;   249  C h a p t e r   1 0     U s i n g O t h e r   g a m e L i b   F e a t u r e s     :   T h e D o g f i g h t    G a m e    downKey = Kb_trapkey "f" ;    Gl_start  ;    Gl_hook "mainLoop  " ;  }    end init  Responding to the Keyboard Input The code in the main loop is reasonably straightforward. All it does is check each key handler and change the aircraft’s position and direction accordingly. The cell anima- tion is completely automatic.  H I N T  I chose to model the behavior of an aircraft’s joystick. When the pilot pushes the joy- stick forward, the plane’s nose goes down, and when the joystick is pulled back, the nose goes up. It would be great if you could use the arrow keys, but JavaScript does not trap for any keys but the normal alphanumeric keys. I decided to go for a set of keys near the middle of the keyboard and arrange them as if they were the control yoke of an aircraft. That’s why the vkey pulls the nose up and the fkey points the nose down. If you don’t like this arrangement, just assign different keys to up and down.

It’s time to shoot something!  Creating the Balloon Buster Game Figure 10.7 shows the Balloon Buster game, which is a variation of the plane game that adds a target  a balloon  and the ability to shoot at the target.  This variation of the game has a fire button and a balloon suitable for shooting.  Initializing the Sprites In addition to providing the cloud and plane sprites, I added two more sprites, the target and the bullet. Here is the code that initializes these two sprites:  target = new Sp_Sprite  ;    target.setImage "blimp.gif", 50, 50, 1,1 ;    target.moveTo 50, 50 ;    target.setSpeed 2 ;    target.setXYdegs 90 ;    target.setXlimits 0, 500 ;    target.setYlimits 0, 300 ;    target.bounces = true;   251  C h a p t e r   1 0     U s i n g O t h e r   g a m e L i b   F e a t u r e s     :   T h e D o g f i g h t    G a m e  FIGURE 10.7  Finally, a game with  some needless  violence!    bullet = new Sp_Sprite  ;    bullet.setImage "bullet.gif", 10, 10, 1, 1 ;    target.setFrame 0 ;    target.switchOn  ;    target.collides = true;    bullet.setXlimits 0,500 ;    bullet.setYlimits 0,300 ;    bullet.bounces = false;    bullet.setFrame 0 ;    bullet.collides = true;  The target is a slow balloon. I set its speed to 2 and its initial direction to 90 degrees. I turned on the bounces feature, so that the balloon will always simply bounce off the wall and stay in a predictable pattern. The bullet is a tiny sprite, also with only one image. It should not bounce, but stop when it reaches the edge of the boundary area. Both sprites check for collisions.  Writing the Collision-Detection Routines The plane-movement commands are exactly like those in the Simple Plane Demo pro- gram. All the new information has to do with firing the bullets and detecting colli- sions. Here is the additional code in the mainLoop   function:    if  fireKey.pressed {      bullet.moveTo plane.x, plane.y ;   252      bullet.setSpeed 7 ;      bullet.setXYdegs plane.xydegs ;      bullet.switchOn  ;    }    end fireKey  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i      check for collisions    if  plane.hit == target {      window.status = "crashed into target!!";    }    end if    if  bullet.hit == target {      window.status = "shot down target!!";      bullet.switchOff  ;      bullet.moveTo  600, 600 ;    }    end if      check for bullet bounds    if   bullet.x >= bullet.xmax - bullet.width           bullet.x <= bullet.xmin           bullet.y >= bullet.ymax - bullet.width           bullet.y <= bullet.ymin   {        bullet.switchOff  ;        bullet.moveTo 600,600 ;    }    end if  First the program checks the fire-key handler to see whether the player has fired. If so, the bullet’s initial direction and position are copied from the plane, and its speed is set to 7. This causes the bullet to fly in the current direction that the plane is going. Then the program checks for various collisions. If the bullet hit the target, something good should happen  good for the player, bad for the balloon . The program also checks for a collision between the balloon and the plane, which would presumably be bad for both.  H I N T  Of course, the code for this particular example could be far more robust. It would be nice to add code for some explosions and scorekeeping functionality. Feel free to add those things if you wish. I chose to develop the game in another direction, so I left this code as it is. At a minimum, it’s a good idea to include code that says “a collision occurred” so that you can add actual functionality later if you wish. This type of code that serves as a placeholder for future development is sometimes called a stub.  Returning to the Dogfight Game As usual, this chapter has introduced all the required elements to create the game at the beginning of the chapter, so all you have to do to create the Dogfight game is put the pieces together. The only thing that’s really new in the Dogfight game is the two- player capability.   253  C h a p t e r   1 0     U s i n g O t h e r   g a m e L i b   F e a t u r e s     :   T h e D o g f i g h t    G a m e  Creating the Variables This program involves four different libraries, so I imported them all. To shorten the code, I decided to make the planes and bullets into arrays. I had variables handle the keystrokes, direction, and damage for each plane. I also created a variable for the in- structions and scoreboard  which will be layers  and for the sounds. Here’s the code that creates the variables:     <script language="Javascript" src=".. gamelib196 gamelib  gamelib_sprites.js">  <script language = "Javascript" src=".. gamelib196 gamelib  gamelib_keyboard.js">  <script language = "Javascript" src=".. gamelib196 gamelib  gamelib_sound.js">                   sprites  var up0;  var dn0;  var fire0;  var up1;  var dn1;  var fire1;  var plane = new Array 2 ;  var bullet = new Array 2 ;  var cloud;    keyboard handling variables    scorekeeping variables  var damage0 = 100;  var damage1 = 100;    direction constants  var NORTH = 0;  var NORTHEAST = 1;  var EAST = 2;  var SOUTHEAST = 3;   254  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  var SOUTH = 4;  var SOUTHWEST = 5;  var WEST = 6;  var NORTHWEST = 7;  var direction0 = EAST;  var direction1 = WEST;  var scoreboard;    sound  var sndBang;  var sndHit;  function init  {      set offsets    Sp_xoffset = 100;    Sp_yoffset = 100;      set up key traps    up0 = Kb_trapkey "z" ;    dn0 = Kb_trapkey "q" ;    fire0 = Kb_trapkey "a" ;    up1 = Kb_trapkey "m" ;    dn1 = Kb_trapkey "o" ;    fire1 = Kb_trapkey "k" ;  Setting Up the Keyboard and Sounds The  init   function has a lot of work to do. First, I set up sprite offsets, which are variables I will use to make the program look more centered in the Web page. I then generated all the keyboard handlers with the  Kb_trapkey   function. Next, I gener- ated the sound files with the Sd_add_sound   function. Here’s the code:      set up sounds    sndBang = new Sd_add_sound "bang.wav" ;    sndHit = new Sd_add_sound "hit.wav" ;  Setting Up the Sprites The core elements of this game are the sprites. I chose to make arrays of both planes and bullets to make the code a little shorter and easier to debug. The planes and bul- lets are nearly identical to those in the earlier plane programs, except that they are elements of arrays. Here’s the code:    set up background graphic    cloud = new Sp_Sprite  ;   255  C h a p t e r   1 0     U s i n g O t h e r   g a m e L i b   F e a t u r e s     :   T h e D o g f i g h t    G a m e    cloud.setImage "clouds.gif", 500, 300, 1, 1 ;    cloud.moveTo 0, 0 ;    cloud.setXlimits 0, 500 ;    cloud.setYlimits 0, 300 ;    cloud.setFrame 0 ;    cloud.switchOn  ;    for  i = 0; i < 2; i++ {      plane[i] = new Sp_Sprite  ;      plane[i].setSpeed 3 ;      plane[i].setXYdegs 90 ;      plane[i].setXlimits 0, 500 ;      plane[i].setYlimits 0, 300 ;      plane[i].bounces = false;      plane[i].setFrame 0       plane[i].setAnimationSpeed 3, "forward" ;      plane[i].collides = true;      plane[i].switchOn  ;      bullet[i] = new Sp_Sprite  ;      bullet[i].setImage "bullet.gif", 10, 10, 1, 1 ;      bullet[i].moveTo -20, -20 ;      bullet[i].setXlimits -20,520 ;      bullet[i].setYlimits -20, 320 ;      bullet[i].bounces = false;      bullet[i].setFrame 0 ;      bullet[i].collides = true;      bullet[i].switchOn  ;    }    end for loop    plane[0].setImage "plane0.gif", 20, 20, 8, 2 ;    plane[1].setImage "plane1.gif", 20, 20, 8, 2 ;  I set up the initial images of the plane to be different graphics, so they would not be the same color.  Setting Up the Layers The scoreboard and the instructions are both layers. The scoreboard will be dynami- cally updated with the score. The instruction layer will simply sit there. The code for the instruction layer is long, but very simple, because it simply builds the HTML for the instructions.  I could have put the instructions in a simple HTML page and loaded it up, but I liked having the HTML accessible here in the program for debugging pur- poses.  Here’s the code for the layers:    set up scoreboard layer    scoreboard = new Gl_layer 0, 100, 100, "" ;   256  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i    scoreboard.write "player 1 player 2" ;    scoreboard.show  ;    scoreboard.setXlimits 0,300 ;    scoreboard.setYlimits 0,300 ;    resetGame  ;      set up instruction layer    var instructions = new Gl_layer 0, 150, 100, "" ;    var inText = "";    inText+= "  Instructions ";    inText+= " ";    inText+= "   cmd  ";    inText += "  red  ";    inText += "  blue   ";    inText+= "   up  ";    inText += "  m  ";    inText += "  z   ";    inText+= "   down  ";    inText += "  o  ";    inText += "  q   ";    inText+= "   fire  ";    inText += "  k  ";    inText += "  a   ";    inText+= " ";    inText+= " ";    inText+= "";    instructions.write inText ;    instructions.show  ;    Gl_hook "mainLoop  " ;    Gl_start  ;  }    end init  The init   function closes with the expected hook   and start   functions.  Writing the resetGame   Function The program calls the  resetGame   function when the game starts or restarts. It is responsible for resetting the score variables and placing the planes in the appropriate starting positions. Here’s the function’s code:  function resetGame  {      starts up the main game variables   257  C h a p t e r   1 0     U s i n g O t h e r   g a m e L i b   F e a t u r e s     :   T h e D o g f i g h t    G a m e  Checking for Direction Changes in the Main Loop The main loop has a number of jobs that all involve checking for various events in the game. The first part of the function checks whether either player has chosen to change the attitude of his or her aircraft:    direction0 = EAST;    direction1 = WEST;    damage0 = 100;    damage1 = 100;    plane[0].moveTo 10, 10 ;    plane[0].setXYdegs direction0 * 45 ;    plane[0].setFrame direction0 ;    plane[1].moveTo 380, 10 ;    plane[1].setXYdegs direction1 * 45 ;    plane[1].setFrame direction1 ;    writeScore  ;  }    end resetGame    check for direction key presses    if  up0.pressed {      direction0--;      if  direction0 < NORTH {        direction0 = NORTHWEST;      }    end if    }    end if    if  dn0.pressed {      direction0++;      if  direction0 > NORTHWEST {        direction0 = NORTH;      }    end if    }    end if    if  up1.pressed {      direction1--;      if  direction1 < NORTH {        direction1 = NORTHWEST;      }    end if    }    end if    if  dn1.pressed {   258      direction1++;      if  direction1 > NORTHWEST {        direction1 = NORTH;      }    end if    }    end if    plane[0].setFrame direction0 ;    plane[1].setFrame direction1 ;    plane[0].setXYdegs direction0 * 45 ;    plane[1].setXYdegs direction1 * 45 ;  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  After setting up the directions, you set up the planes to use the appropriate frame and direction.  Checking for Gunfire Now the main loop checks the fire keys to determine whether either player is cur- rently firing:    check for bullet firing    if  fire0.pressed {      sndBang.play  ;      bullet[0].moveTo plane[0].x, plane[0].y ;      bullet[0].setXYdegs plane[0].xydegs ;      bullet[0].setSpeed 10 ;    }    end plane 0 fires    if  fire1.pressed {      sndBang.play  ;      bullet[1].moveTo plane[1].x, plane[1].y ;      bullet[1].setXYdegs plane[1].xydegs ;      bullet[1].setSpeed 10 ;    }    end plane 0 fires  If a player fired, the main loop sets the appropriate bullet into motion and plays an appropriate sound effect.  Checking for Hits In this program, I decided to check only for hits that involve the bullet striking the plane. The code is reasonably straightforward:    check for hits    if  bullet[0].hasHit plane[1]  {      sndHit.play  ;      damage0--;      writeScore  ;     if  bullet[1].hasHit plane[0]  {    }    end if      sndHit.play  ;      damage1--;      writeScore  ;    }    end if  }    end mainLoop  When a hit occurs, the function plays a sound and decrements the damage amount of the victim. It then calls the writeScore   function so that the players can tell what occurred. Each plane starts out at 100 percent functional. When the damage value falls below 0, the plane is destroyed.  Creating the writeScore   Function The writeScore   function writes a new score into the scoreboard layer. It also checks whether either player’s plane has been destroyed and sends appropriate messages. Here’s the function’s code.  function writeScore  {    var scoreText = "";    scoreText += " ";    scoreText += "red:  " + damage0 + "% ";    scoreText += "blue: " + damage1 + "%";    scoreText += " ";    scoreboard.write scoreText ;  259  C h a p t e r   1 0     U s i n g O t h e r   g a m e L i b   F e a t u r e s     :   T h e D o g f i g h t    G a m e      check for a win    if  damage0 < 1 {      alert "blue wins!!" ;      resetGame  ;    }   end if    if  damage1 < 1 {      alert "red wins!!" ;      resetGame  ;    }    end if  }    end writeScore  Summary In this chapter, you have seen how you can improve sprites to handle cell animation. You have also learned how to respond to keyboard input and add sound to your pro- grams. You also learned how to use layers to add dynamic content to your program, and how to use sprites as background graphics.   E X E R C I S E S  1. Improve the Balloon Buster game by adding explosion animations.  2. Add a scorekeeping function  or two  to the Balloon Buster game.  3. Add keyboard handling to the Racer game from the last chapter.  4. Write a version of Space Invaders in which the player controls a spaceship that moves along the bottom of the screen. The aliens can be an array of sprites. Start with just one alien, then add more once the first is working correctly.  260  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i   C H A P T E R  11  Cookies and the  Mouse: The  Jigsaw Puzzle In this chapter, you will add sophisticated  mouse-handling techniques to your reper- toire, and you will learn how to add a measure of permanence to your programs through the use of cookies.

This pro- gram allows you to make a puzzle out of any image on the Internet. You can scramble the image, then use your mouse to piece the picture back together.  Scrambling the Pieces Initially, the program shows the image totally scrambled  see Figure 11.1 . The image is broken into 25 equal squares  although you’ll be able to make as many pieces as you want, once you understand the code .  You can rescramble the picture by clicking the Scramble button.  The buttons are interesting because they are not standard HTML buttons, yet they still respond to mouse clicks and even look “pushed in” when the user clicks them.  Using the Solve Button When the user clicks the Solve button, the program draws the image with all the pieces in the right order, but not quite touching  see Figure 11.2 .  Using the Hint Button If the user wants a hint, he or she can press the Hint button. The program then dis- plays a small version of the image, which can also be moved around on the screen  see Figure 11.3 .  Clicking the Hint button again causes the image to disappear.  FIGURE 11.1  The image is totally  scrambled.   263  C h a p t e r   1 1     C o o k i e s a n d   t h e M o u s e        :   T h e J i g s a w P u z z l e     FIGURE 11.2  The program can automatically solve the puzzle  but what  fun is that? .  FIGURE 11.3  The Hint button shows what the  puzzle will look like  when finished.  Changing the Puzzle Image If the user clicks the New Pic button, a dialog box appears asking the user to supply the address of an image on the Internet. The program then uses that image for the puzzle  see Figures 11.4 and 11.5 .  As an added feature, the next time that the user plays the jigsaw game on the same browser, the program will automatically call up the newly selected image.   264  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 11.4  The user can request a new  image for the puzzle.  FIGURE 11.5  The new image shows up as a  scrambled puzzle.  Using the Mouse to Drag and Drop The most obvious new element in the puzzle game is the enhanced input from the mouse. To understand how this element works, you’ll start by looking at a simpler program that illustrates how you can use the mouse to move a sprite around.  Creating the Dragger Program The Dragger program features a sprite that the user can move anywhere on the screen by dragging it with the mouse  see Figures 11.6 and 11.7 .   265  C h a p t e r   1 1     C o o k i e s a n d   t h e M o u s e        :   T h e J i g s a w P u z z l e     FIGURE 11.6  The ball is in the upper-left corner.  FIGURE 11.7  The user can  move the ball by dragging it around  the screen.  Both of the major browsers have techniques for reading and responding to the mouse events, but  you guessed it  these techniques are not the same in the two browsers. Fortunately, gameLib simplifies the process of reading the mouse object considerably.  Creating a Mouse Object The secret to mouse manipulation in gameLib is the mouse object. It is no surprise that you will incorporate a new module and build a mouse object. Here’s the script inclu- sion and variable creation code for the Dragger program:   266         dragger               var thePic;  var theMouse;  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i     <script language="Javascript" src=".. gamelib196 gamelib  gamelib_sprites.js">     The only major new element is the gamelib_mouse.js code module. This module en- capsulates a series of objects and functions for using the mouse.  I created variables for the sprite and mouse objects. As usual, I will give the objects values in an init   function.  Making a Sprite Draggable Inside the init   function, I created a mouse object with the Ms_initmouse   function. I also created a sprite called theImage. All it takes to make theImage draggable is to set its draggable property to true. Here’s the code for the init   function:    thePic.setImage "ball.gif", 50, 50, 1, 1 ;  function init  {       dragger       Andy Harris    theMouse = Ms_initmouse  ;    thePic = new Sp_Sprite  ;    thePic.setXlimits 0, 500 ;    thePic.setYlimits 0, 300 ;    thePic.setFrame 0 ;    thePic.setAnimation 0 ;    thePic.draggable = true;    thePic.switchOn  ;    thePic.moveTo 200, 200 ;  }    end init   Be sure that you have generated a mouse object before you set the  draggable property of a sprite to true. If there is no mouse object, the sprite will not drag.  Layers also have a draggable property that works in exactly the same way.  T R A P  H I N T  The mouse object has very few proper- ties and methods of its own. In gameLib, making an instance of the mouse object allows you to activate features of other elements  such as the draggable prop- erty .  Mouse  manipulation  is  usually done differently in other languages.  In many languages, you have to look at the x and y values of the mouse to figure out whether it is over a particular object.  The gameLib technique is a very easy ap- proach to using the mouse as it is needed in game programming.  IN THE REAL WORLD  Dragging and dropping objects is  useful  in  a  number  of  other more  serious  applications  as well as in games.  If you are writing an anatomy tu- torial,  for  example,  you  could make sprites for each of the ma- jor organs and allow the user to drag them around and fit them together in an abdomen image.  Likewise, if you were writing a promotional  page  for  a  cruise line, you might let the user drag a ship icon around on a map and pop  up  relevant  information whenever  the  user  drops  the ship over a specific port.  Table 11.1 describes the members of the mouse object, and Table 11.2 describes the draggable elements.  267  C h a p t e r   1 1     C o o k i e s a n d   t h e M o u s e        :   T h e J i g s a w P u z z l e     TABLE 11.1 PRIMARY MEMBERS OF THE MOUSE OBJECT  Member  Ms_initmouse  ;  .x, .y  .mousedown  alert "ouch!" ; }     end if .over  Example  var myMouse =  Ms_initmouse  ;  Description Creates a reference to the mouse object. Specifies the current x and y coordinates of the mouse. Returns whether the user is currently clicking the mouse button. Returns the sprite object that if  myMouse.over == the mouse is currently over.  ball  { score++; }  " myMouse.y ;  alert myMouse.x + ",  if myMouse.mousedown {     end if   268  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  TABLE 11.2 DRAGGABLE ELEMENTS  Object and Member  sprite.draggable  layer.draggable  Description If set to true, enables the user to drag and drop the sprite. If set to true, enables the user to drag and drop the layer.  Example  true;  mySprite.draggable =  myLayer.draggable =  true;  IN THE REAL WORLD  As you can see, games are not the only medium in which this behavior is useful. You can use the  technique  outlined  in  this section any time that you want buttons with a more specialized look than you can achieve with standard form buttons.  Responding to Button Presses In addition to knowing when the user is dragging and dropping a sprite, you might be interested in knowing when the user has passed over or clicked on  a  particular  sprite.  These  are  reasonably  easy things to check with gameLib’s mouse module.  Writing the Button Program Figures  11.8  through  11.10  show  the  Button  pro- gram, which is a form that includes a sprite that looks like a button. When the user places the mouse cursor over the button, the sprite changes appearance, and when he or she clicks the mouse button over the sprite, the program displays a message.  FIGURE 11.8  This form has a  sprite that looks like  a button.   269  C h a p t e r   1 1     C o o k i e s a n d   t h e M o u s e        :   T h e J i g s a w P u z z l e     FIGURE 11.9  When the mouse is over the sprite, the  button looks pushed in.  FIGURE 11.10  When the user  clicks the sprite, the  program pops up  a message.     var theButton;  Initializing a Sprite for Mouse Input This program again uses the  mouse object, but it also relies on some properties of the sprite object to do the real work. Take a look at the initialization of the Button program:   270  var theMouse;  function init  {       button       Andy Harris  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i    theMouse = Ms_initmouse  ;    theButton = new Sp_Sprite  ;    theButton.setImage "button.gif", 100, 40, 1, 2 ;    theButton.setXlimits 0, 400 ;    theButton.setYlimits 0, 300 ;    theButton.setFrame 0 ;    theButton.setAnimation 0 ;    theButton.moveTo 100,100 ;    theButton.switchOn  ;    theButton.onclickdown = "click  ";    theButton.onmouseout = "out  ";    theButton.onclickup = "sayOuch  ";  }    end init  Table 11.3 lists the mouse event handlers of the sprite and layer objects.  I imported the  core,  sprite, and  mouse objects, then created objects for the button itself and the mouse. The button is a basic two-frame sprite  see Figure 11.11 .  FIGURE 11.11  This is the  image used in the  button sprite.   271  C h a p t e r   1 1     C o o k i e s a n d   t h e M o u s e        :   T h e J i g s a w P u z z l e     TABLE 11.3 MOUSE EVENT HANDLERS OF THE SPRITE  Property  ,onclickdown  ,onclickup  .onmouseover  .onmouseout  AND LAYER OBJECTS  Description Binds a function to call when the user presses the mouse button while the cursor is over the element. Binds a function to call when the user releases the mouse button while the cursor is over the element. Binds a function to call when the mouse cursor is over an element  regardless of button status . Binds a function to call when the mouse cursor leaves an element  regardless of button status .  Example  mySprite.onclickdown =  "click  ";  mySprite.onclickup =  "released  ";  mySprite.onmouseover =  "over  ";  mySprite.onmouseout =  "out  ";  These are properties of both the sprite and the layer objects. All are read and write properties. They work just like the event handlers in traditional HTML DHTML.  I set up the sprite in all the typical ways, but added a few more lines. The onclickdown, onmouseover, onmouseout, and onclickup properties are used much like the event han- dlers in typical JavaScript. You can assign a JavaScript command or function call to each of these properties, and the sprite will automatically call the appropriate method when the corresponding mouse action occurs. For these special sprite properties to work, you must define a mouse object.  onclickdown occurs when the user presses the mouse button while the mouse cursor is within the boundaries of the sprite. onclickup executes when the user releases the mouse button while the mouse cursor is within the sprite object. onmouseover occurs when the mouse cursor moves over the sprite  whether the button is pressed or not . onmouseout occurs when the mouse cursor leaves the sprite’s boundaries  again, re- gardless of the button’s condition .  Responding to the Mouse Events Of course, when you respond to mouse events, you usually must write a function to handle each of the appropriate events. Here’s the rest of the code for the Button program:  function click  {    theButton.setAnimation 1 ;   272  }    end over  function out  {    theButton.setAnimation 0 ;  }   end out  function sayOuch  {    alert "ouch!" ;    theButton.setAnimation 0 ;  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  The click   function is associated with onmousedown. This function executes when the user clicks the mouse button while the mouse cursor is over the button sprite. The function sets the animation to frame 1, which makes the image look as though it is pressed down.  The out   function is set up to run whenever the mouse leaves the sprite. It sets the animation back to frame 0, which makes the button look like it’s sticking up again.  The sayOuch   function displays an alert message to the user. It is set to the onclickup event of the sprite.  T R I C K  You might find it surprising, but it is more common to put code in the mouse-up procedure than in the mouse-down procedure. Users typically don’t expect the criti- cal action to happen until they release the mouse button. If you place your code in the mouse-up procedure, you give users a chance to move the mouse cursor off of the sprite before releasing the mouse button if they made a mistake.  Following the Mouse and Sprites Although not used in the jigsaw puzzle program, the  sprite object works with the mouse in another interesting way. Sprites in the latest version of gameLib have the ability to follow and target the mouse or other sprites. This allows for some very inter- esting effects.  IN THE REAL WORLD  The  follow  method  might  be useful if you want to use a sprite as a caption to another sprite, or if you want to supplement the mouse  pointer  with  another kind  of  pointer.   Sadly,  there does  not  appear  to  be  a  plat- form-independent  way  to  turn off the standard mouse cursor.   The Follower Program In the Follower program  see Figure 11.12 , as the user moves the mouse around the screen, a series of balls follow the mouse around.  You’ll probably have to run the program to get the full effect, but it is captivating and reasonably easy to create.  The Follow Method Sprites have a follow method, which allows you to specify a particular sprite  or the mouse  to follow, and an X and Y offset to follow the sprite or mouse.   273  C h a p t e r   1 1     C o o k i e s a n d   t h e M o u s e        :   T h e J i g s a w P u z z l e     FIGURE 11.12  My three-year-old calls this a “choo- choo train of dots.”     var biggest;  var bigger;  var big;  var medium;  When told to follow another sprite or the mouse, a sprite will stay with that object as if the sprite and the object were one object.  The Target Method The target method of the sprite object works much like the follow method. However, instead of causing the sprite to follow the targeted object immediately, the method ensures that the sprite will move toward the targeted object according to the speed setting of the sprite.  T R I C K  Targeting an object is a great way to add some “artificial intelligence” to sprites on the screen. You can have enemy sprites target the player sprite, and they will head straight for the player. You can also target your bullets at an enemy to simulate “smart missiles” that are guaranteed to hit the enemy.  How the Follower Works The Follower program is simply a set of sprite objects that follow each other and ulti- mately follow the mouse. I’ve added code for the first three sprites; all the others work pretty much the same way.   274  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  var small;  var smaller;  var smallest;  var theMouse;  function init  {    theMouse = Ms_initmouse  ;    biggest = new Sp_Sprite  ;    biggest.setImage "ball.gif", 20, 20, 1, 1 ;    biggest.moveTo 100,100 ;    biggest.setXlimits 0, 500 ;    biggest.setYlimits 0, 300 ;    biggest.setFrame 0 ;    biggest.switchOn  ;    biggest.setSpeed 8 ;    biggest.target theMouse, 5, 15 ;    bigger = new Sp_Sprite  ;    bigger.setImage "ball.gif", 19, 19, 1, 1 ;    bigger.moveTo 100,200 ;    bigger.setXlimits 0, 500 ;    bigger.setYlimits 0, 300 ;    bigger.setFrame 0 ;    bigger.switchOn  ;    bigger.setSpeed 7 ;    bigger.target biggest, 0, 5 ;    big = new Sp_Sprite  ;    big.setImage "ball.gif", 18, 18, 1, 1 ;    big.moveTo 100,200 ;    big.setXlimits 0, 500 ;    big.setYlimits 0, 300 ;    big.setFrame 0 ;    big.switchOn  ;    big.setSpeed 6 ;    big.target bigger, 0, 5 ;  As you can see, the biggest sprite targets the mouse and has a speed setting of 8. Each succeeding sprite is smaller and slower and targets the previous sprite.  Table 11.4 describes the following and targeting commands of sprite objects.   275  C h a p t e r   1 1     C o o k i e s a n d   t h e M o u s e        :   T h e J i g s a w P u z z l e     TABLE 11.4 FOLLOWING AND TARGETING COMMANDS  OF THE SPRITE OBJECT  Command  .follow ob, x, y   .target ob, x, y   .stopFollowing ob   .stopTargeting ob   Description Causes the sprite to follow ob  a sprite or the mouse object  at a distance of  x, y  pixels. Causes the sprite to move toward ob at the current speed, aiming toward an offset of  x, y  pixels from ob. Tells the sprite to stop following ob. Tells the sprite to stop targeting ob.  Example  mySprite.follow   theMouse, 0, 10 ;  mySprite.target   theMouse, 0, 10 ;  mySprite.stopFollowing   theMouse ;  mySprite.stopTargeting   theMouse   Storing Information in Cookies Although  JavaScript  and  dynamic  HTML  are  terrific  environments  for  basic  game development, the security restrictions of client-side programming make developing certain common game elements very difficult. It would be great if your games could have some type of persistence. You might want to be able to keep track of high scores or custom configurations. Generally, you would use file-handling techniques for these kinds of problems, but JavaScript does not allow you to manipulate files on the user’s computer.  This restriction is actually a good thing, because it prevents malicious programmers from writing viruses that are embedded in the JavaScript of innocent- looking Web pages.  JavaScript does support one feature that provides a limited yet capable way of storing a small amount of information on the user’s computer. This technology is called a cookie.  Creating the Cookie Demo Program The Cookie Demo program  see Figures 11.13 through 11.15  illustrates the gameLib approach to manipulating a cookie.  The program illustrates how cookies can be used to preserve information even after a client has left your site and returned to it.   276  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 11.13  The user types  some value into the  text box.  FIGURE 11.14  The user has shut off the computer, then later returned  to the Web site.   277  C h a p t e r   1 1     C o o k i e s a n d   t h e M o u s e        :   T h e J i g s a w P u z z l e     FIGURE 11.15  The stored value  comes back!        var myCookie;  function init  {       Cookie Demo       Andy Harris  }    end init  Creating a Cookie Cookie information is part of the gameLib core library. You do not have to import any other modules to use cookies. Here’s the initialization code to the Cookie Demo program:       myCookie = new Gl_cookie "cookieDemo" ;  Cookies are created like many other gameLib objects. I created a variable called myCookie and then created an instance of the cookie object by calling the new Gl_cookie   func- tion. The string parameter is the name of the cookie.  H I N T  Generally, cookies have names and expiration dates, but the gameLib library auto- mates the expiration process for you. The cookie data is stored in a text file on the client’s hard drive. Each cookie is normally restricted to 255 characters, and a lim- ited number of cookies are allowed from any one site. Cookies contain only text data, which prevents them from being used as viruses.  Table 11.5 describes gameLib’s cookie-handling commands.   TABLE 11.5 COOKIE-HANDLING COMMANDS  Command  new Gl_cookie   cookieName   Example  var myCookie =  new Gl_cookie "test" ;  .setValue value   myCookie.setValue "Hi" ;  .value  alert myCookie.value ;  Description Creates a new cookie object with cookieName as its name. Sets the cookie’s value to value. Returns the cookie’s value.  Writing the HTML in the Cookie Demo Program This program uses a basic HTML form, so it will help you to understand the JavaScript if you can see how I named the form elements:  278  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i         Cookie Demo       The value is  <input type = "text"         name = "txtIO">   <input type = "button"         value = "save cookie"         onClick = "saveCookie  ">  <input type = "button"         value = "load cookie"         onClick = "loadCookie  ">              This is pretty standard HTML with a text box and two buttons on it. One button will call the load cookie function, and the other will store the cookie.  Storing to the Cookie Once you have created a cookie object, the process of sending a value to the cookie is very straightforward. Here’s the saveCookie   function:  function saveCookie  {  }    end saveCookie    myCookie.setvalue document.myForm.txtIO.value ;   279  C h a p t e r   1 1     C o o k i e s a n d   t h e M o u s e        :   T h e J i g s a w P u z z l e     The cookie object’s setvalue   method is used to send a text value to the cookie. Since the cookie is actually part of a text file, the value will be retained even if the user turns off the browser.  T R A P  Don’t become too reliant on cookies as a major part of your program, because they have some limitations. First, the user can always turn cookies off, which means your data will not be stored or retrieved. Second, the data in the cookie is specific to the particular browser and computer that the user is currently using. If a user stores data on a Web page at work, then visits the same page at home, the cookie will not be available. Even if the user switches browsers on the same computer, the cookie will not be available, because each browser uses a different cookie file.  Retrieving Data from the Cookie It’s just as easy to get data from a cookie, because the cookie object has a value prop- erty that contains the text stored in the cookie. Here’s the loadCookie   function from the Cookie Demo program:  function loadCookie  {    document.myForm.txtIO.value = myCookie.value;  }    end if  I simply copied the value property of the cookie object back to the text box on the form.  Creating the Jigsaw Puzzle Program Most of the components in this chapter come together in the Jigsaw Puzzle program. The program doesn’t introduce much that is new, but it can look a little bit overwhelm- ing when you see all the pieces working on the same program. This section takes you through the program one chunk at a time.  Modules and Variable Creation The puzzle requires the core, sprite, and mouse modules, and it involves a number of game-level variables. Here’s the startup code:     <script language="Javascript" src=".. gamelib196 gamelib  gamelib_sprites.js">                   puzzle piece variables   280  var numRows = 5;  var numCols = 5;  var puzzle = new Array numRows ;    button variables  var btnSolve;  var btnScramble;  var btnHint;  var btnNewImg;  var lyrHint;  var imgCookie;  var theMouse;    variables for the hint, the cookie, and the mouse  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i    The image that the puzzle is based on  var theImage = "balls.gif";  var hintShowing = false;  The most important variable in the game is the  puzzle array. It will become a two- dimensional array of sprite objects. Each element of the array contains the entire im- age, but shows just a small part of it, by assigning a frame and animation value based on the row and column of the puzzle piece. The buttons are all sprites. The program uses a layer for the hint screen, a cookie to store the current image, and a variable to handle the mouse. All the variables for these elements are created outside a function, but they will be initialized within the init   function.  The init   Function This game has a lot of initialization. The player does most of the work after the whole thing is set up. The puzzle game’s logic is almost entirely devoted to setting up the environment so that the user can play. The program must initialize nearly every ob- ject, so I decided to break the initialization into several other functions, then call those functions from init  . Here’s the init   code:  function init  {       jigsaw       Andy Harris      get the previous image from the cookie if you can    imgCookie = new Gl_cookie "puzzle_image" ;    if  imgCookie.value == null {        if you cannot get an image, go with the default      theImage = "balls.gif";    } else {      theImage = imgCookie.value;   281  C h a p t e r   1 1     C o o k i e s a n d   t h e M o u s e        :   T h e J i g s a w P u z z l e         run functions to manage all the other setup tasks    }    end if      get a reference to the mouse    theMouse=Ms_initmouse  ;    setUpButtons  ;    setUpPuzzle  ;    scramble  ;    setUpLayer  ;      start the game loop    Gl_start  ;  }    end init  The first order of business is to look for an image file stored in a cookie. If the user has played this game on this browser on this machine and has chosen an image file, the cookie will store that file  see the section “The newImg   Function” for details on how this is done . The init   function looks for the existence of such a cookie. If the cookie exists, the function uses the image referenced in the cookie. If not,  init   uses a default image.  The init   function creates a reference to the mouse object and calls a bunch of other functions to set up the various other screen elements. When these functions are done, the init   function starts up the gameLib engine.  The setUpButtons   Function The setUpButtons   function is responsible for setting up the buttons. I wanted a cus- tom feel, so each button is a sprite. To simplify things, the buttons all use the same graphic  see Figure 11.16 .  I simply copied and pasted the original button image from the Button program earlier in the chapter, then added text for the appropriate buttons.  Here’s the code for the setUpButtons   function:  function setUpButtons  {      initialize the button sprites    btnScramble.setImage "pzlBtns.gif", 100, 40, 4, 2 ;      scramble button    btnScramble = new Sp_Sprite  ;    btnScramble.setFrame 0 ;    btnScramble.setAnimation 0 ;    btnScramble.setXlimits 0, 500 ;    btnScramble.setYlimits 0, 400 ;    btnScramble.moveTo 100, 350 ;   282  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 11.16  This graphic contains all the button images  needed.    btnScramble.onmouseover = "over btnScramble ";    btnScramble.onclickup = "scramble  ";    btnScramble.onmouseout = "out btnScramble ";    btnScramble.switchOn  ;    btnHint.setImage "pzlBtns.gif", 100, 40, 4, 2 ;      hint button    btnHint = new Sp_Sprite  ;    btnHint.setFrame 2 ;    btnHint.setAnimation 0 ;    btnHint.setXlimits 0, 500 ;    btnHint.setYlimits 0, 400 ;    btnHint.moveTo 210, 350 ;    btnHint.onmouseover = "over btnHint ";    btnHint.onclickup = "hint  ";    btnHint.onmouseout = "out btnHint ";    btnHint.switchOn  ;    btnSolve.setImage "pzlBtns.gif", 100, 40, 4, 2 ;      solve button    btnSolve = new Sp_Sprite  ;    btnSolve.setFrame 1 ;    btnSolve.setAnimation 0 ;    btnSolve.setXlimits 0, 500 ;   283  C h a p t e r   1 1     C o o k i e s a n d   t h e M o u s e        :   T h e J i g s a w P u z z l e       btnSolve.setYlimits 0, 400 ;    btnSolve.moveTo 320, 350 ;    btnSolve.onmouseover = "over btnSolve ";    btnSolve.onclickup = "solve  ";    btnSolve.onmouseout = "out btnSolve ";    btnSolve.switchOn  ;    btnNewImg.setImage "pzlBtns.gif", 100, 40, 4, 2 ;      new Image button    btnNewImg = new Sp_Sprite  ;    btnNewImg.setFrame 3 ;    btnNewImg.setAnimation 0 ;    btnNewImg.setXlimits 0, 500 ;    btnNewImg.setYlimits 0, 400 ;    btnNewImg.moveTo 430, 350 ;    btnNewImg.onmouseover = "over btnNewImg ";    btnNewImg.onclickup = "newImg  ";    btnNewImg.onmouseout = "out btnNewImg ";    btnNewImg.switchOn  ;  }    end setUpButtons;  The code sets up each button in basically the same way. The buttons are all typical sprites. The code sets each to a different frame, so that the program’s interface dis- plays the appropriate words. All the buttons call the over   function when the mouse cursor is over the button and the out   function when the mouse cursor leaves. The event handlers pass a reference to the current button to these functions. The onclickup event of each button calls a function specific to that event  for example,  btnNewImg calls the newImg   function, and btnSolve calls the solve   function .  The setUpPuzzle   Function The setUpPuzzle   function sets up the puzzle array:  function setUpPuzzle  {      initialize the puzzle sprites    var row = 0;    var col = 0;      clear out any puzzle currently in memory      if we just came from the new image command, for example    puzzle = null;    puzzle = new Array  ;      step through each row    for  row = 0; row < numRows; row++ {        make each row a new array         puzzle[row][col].setImage theImage, 30, 30, numRows, numCols ;  284      puzzle[row] = new Array numCols ;        for each object in the row...      for  col = 0; col < numCols; col++ {          create a sprite        puzzle[row][col] = new Sp_Sprite  ;        puzzle[row][col].setFrame col ;        puzzle[row][col].setAnimation row ;        puzzle[row][col].setXlimits 0, 500 ;        puzzle[row][col].setYlimits 0, 300 ;        puzzle[row][col].draggable = true;        puzzle[row][col].switchOn  ;      }    end col loop    }    end row loop  }    end setUpPuzzle  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  If there is a puzzle already in memory, the function clears it out and moves all the pieces out of the way. It then makes a new array for each row, then steps through the row making a new sprite.  H I N T  Just as for loops and normal arrays are a natural combination, if you have two- dimensional arrays  as in the puzzle program , you will frequently find yourself writ- ing a pair of nested for loops to step through every element of the array. In this case, the puzzle program has one loop that steps through the rows, and every time that loop executes, it runs another loop that steps through the columns. As a whole, the nested loops work together to ensure that every element in the two-dimensional array is manipulated.  The puzzle sprites are all identical in almost every respect. They all contain the entire image of the finished graphic. They all are the same size, and they all have all the same initial characteristics. However, I set the frame to map the current column, and set the animation cell to map the current row. Since these settings reflect how the original image was designed, this technique breaks the image into 25 pieces that fit together perfectly. I played sort of a dirty trick with the clip animation technique used by gameLib, but the results speak for themselves. Note that I did not worry about the placement of the pieces, because the scramble   function takes care of that.  The setUpLayer   Function The setUpLayer   function manages the layer that holds the hint graphic. The layer setup is reasonably straightforward:  function setUpLayer  {      initialize the hint layer     lyrHint = new Gl_layer 600, 10, 200, "" ;    lyrHint.write " " ;      let the user move the layer outside the puzzle boundaries    lyrHint.setXlimits  0, 800 ;    lyrHint.setYlimits  0, 600 ;    lyrHint.setZ 0 ;    lyrHint.draggable = true;    lyrHint.hide  ;  }    end setUpLayer        make the layer invisible until the user asks for it  The layer contains nothing but an HTML tag referencing the image. I decided to force the image to 100×100 pixels, so that it did not take over the entire screen. If the origi- nal  image  is  not  square,  you  will  have  some  distortion,  but  the  hint  image  will  be exactly proportional to the finished puzzle.  The hint layer is draggable, so the user can choose to move it around.  The over   and out   Functions over   and out   are utility functions that enable each of the buttons to be pushed down when the mouse is over the button, and to push back up when the mouse leaves the button. I added a parameter so that all four buttons can use the same function. When the program calls these functions, they must include a reference to the button that the program is activating. Here is the code for the functions:  285  C h a p t e r   1 1     C o o k i e s a n d   t h e M o u s e        :   T h e J i g s a w P u z z l e     function over theButton {      respond when mouse is over a button    theButton.setAnimation 1 ;  }    end over  function out theButton {      respond when the mouse leaves a button    theButton.setAnimation 0 ;  }    end out  The variable  theButton stores the button that the mouse cursor is currently over. I then set the animation of theButton so that the button appears to be up or down.  T R I C K  Whenever possible, it makes a lot of sense to build functions such as these that you can use for multiple purposes. It would have been very tedious to write separate over   and out   functions for each button in the program.   286  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  The scramble   Function Both the init   method and the Scramble button call the scramble   function. The function steps through the puzzle array. For each piece of the puzzle, scramble   gen- erates random x and y values within the appropriate ranges. The piece is then sent to these coordinates. Here is the function’s code:  function scramble  {      put all the puzzle pieces in a random order    var row = 0;    var col = 0;    var x = 0;    var y = 0;    for  row = 0; row < numRows; row++ {      for  col = 0; col < numCols; col++ {          choose random x and y values for the current piece        x = Math.floor Math.random   * 500  + 1;        y = Math.floor Math.random   * 300  + 1;        puzzle[row][col].moveTo x, y ;      }    end col for    }    end row for  }    end scramble  The solve   Function The solve   function generates a solution to the puzzle. It basically re-creates the origi- nal picture, although the function deliberately leaves a small gap between the pieces, so that the user still has to do a little work to see the complete picture. Here’s the code for the solve   function:      puts all the pieces in order, but not quite touching  function solve  {    var row = 0;    var col = 0;    var x = 0;    var y = 0;    for  row = 0; row < numRows; row++ {      for  col = 0; col < numCols; col++ {          offset the puzzle by  300, 150           put a two pixel gap between pieces        x =  col * 32  + 300;        y = row * 32 + 150;        puzzle[row][col].moveTo x, y ;      }    end col for    }    end row for  }    end solve   The hint   Function The hint   function displays and hides the hint layer:  function hint  {      displays or hides the hint layer    if hintShowing {      lyrHint.hide  ;    } else {      lyrHint.show  ;    }    end if      lyrHint.write " " ;      reverse the value of the hintShowing variable    hintShowing = !hintShowing;  }   end hint  The function checks the value of the hintShowing variable. hint   initializes this vari- able to false, indicating that the hint is not initially showing. If the hint is currently showing, the function hides it. If the hint is not currently showing, the function dis- plays it. I rewrote the HTML of the image just in case the user changed the image since the last time that the program showed the hint layer. Finally, the !  not  operator re- verses the value of the hintShowing variable. If the value is true, it becomes false, and if it is false, it becomes true.  The newImg   Function The newImg   function lets the user choose a new image for the puzzle:  function newImg  {      prompts user for a new image URL    theImage = prompt "URL of new Image:", "ball.gif" ;      clean up old puzzle    for  row = 0; row < numRows; row++ {      for  col = 0; col < numCols; col++ {        puzzle[row][col].setImage "blank.gif", 30, 30, numRows, numCols ;        puzzle[row][col].moveto -100, -100 ;  287  C h a p t e r   1 1     C o o k i e s a n d   t h e M o u s e        :   T h e J i g s a w P u z z l e       lyrHint.write " " ;      }    end col for    }    end row for      reset hint      store URL in cookie    imgCookie.setvalue theImage ;      reset the puzzle with the new image   288    setUpPuzzle  ;    scramble  ;  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i      reset the button so it is sticking up again    out btnNewImg ;  }    end newImg  First, the program uses an ordinary prompt to request the URL of the new image. This can be any valid image file  .gif or .jpg  anywhere on the Internet or on the local machine.  The program then clears out the existing puzzle pieces, to ensure that they did not stay on the screen. The function uses a pair of nested for loops for this, setting each element to a blank image and moving it off the screen.  The program then resets the hint layer so that it reflects the new image. Then the function stores the URL into the cookie, so that the next time that the browser loads the page, the program will display the new image.  The program calls the setUpPuzzle   and scramble   functions to initialize the new puzzle. Then finally the program pops up the button, because often the user will move the mouse off of the button without activating the mouseout event.  Summary In this chapter, you have seen how the mouse object interacts with sprites and layers. You have learned how to drag and drop elements around the screen, and how to set up event handlers for them. You also have learned how to use cookies to store small amounts of  data.  Finally,  you  have  put  all  these  things  together  to  make  an  interesting  and configurable puzzle game.  E X E R C I S E S  1. Use a graphic image with words to make a “refrigerator poetry” game. The page will have  a series of words on it that can be dragged around with the mouse to generate poems.  2. Add a scorekeeping function to the puzzle game. It will need the capability to surmise that each piece is in the appropriate position. You might do this by looking at the position of the upper-left image and calculating what the position of each other piece should be in relationship to this image.  3. Add a timer to the puzzle game. Let the user time how long it takes to solve a puzzle. Use  cookies to add a high-score list.   C H A P T E R  12  The Game  Creation Process: The Brick Game  Throughout this book, you have built a  number  of  interesting  programs  by learning simple, isolated concepts, then putting them together to form the games at the end of each chapter. In this last chapter, you will put together many of the skills that you learned throughout the book to make the basis of an arcade game. Specifically, here are the things you will see in this chapter:    What a design sketch for a game might look like    Where to start programming    How to get the ball rolling    How to add various sprites    How to create and then improve data  structures so that they are more flexible    What to do if you find that you must change your program design when certain functions become unwieldy   290  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  With all that you know by now, you should have all the skills you need to put together interesting games on your Web sites. The thing that usually holds programmers back, however, isn’t lack of programming techniques. The real problem is figuring out the pro- cess of building a program. Earlier in the book, you saw what programs looked like after I finished them—which might have given you the mistaken impression that I wrote them correctly the first time. Game development never happens that way. In this chapter, you see how to design a game from the beginning of the process until the middle.  The end of the process is up to you; a computer program is never fully complete, but the program presented here is stable enough for you to build on and experiment with your own ideas.  Rather than showing you the finished game at the beginning of this chapter, as I have in the previous chapters, I’ll start with an idea, as all good programs do. I’ll show you the same program in several incarnations, so you can see one way to design a game.  IN THE  REAL WORLD  So far, the game is nothing but an  idea.  In  much  of  program- ming, you will have to start with nothing  but  words   and sketches,  which  you  will  learn about next . Make sure that you can describe your program com- pletely, or you will have troubles with the later steps.  The Project: The Brick Game It occurred to me that this book ought to pay hom- age to at least one of the classics of the golden age of arcade games. I decided to try a version of Breakout. You might recall the game. Basically, the player has a paddle that he or she can move across the bottom of the screen. There is a series of bricks arranged at the  top  of  the  screen,  and  a  small  ball  that  can bounce off the walls, the bricks, and the paddle. Each time that the ball hits a brick, that brick disappears. If the ball moves below the paddle, it is lost. The goal is to eliminate all the bricks before losing all three balls. Such programs have many variations, but this is the basic idea behind each of them.  T R I C K  Coming up with game ideas can be one of the most fun parts of game design. Here are a few ways to get started:    Go with a variation on an existing theme  Breakoutwith a goalie played by the  user, or Pacman with the user playing the ghost .    Simulate some part of a real-life game or a dramatic situation  such as landing  an airplane using only instruments or playing a soccer shootout .    Modify the graphics and behavior of an existing game  for example, switch the Basketball game in Chapter 7, “Image Swapping and Lookup Tables: The Bas- ketball Game,” of this book to hockey or volleyball .  The game’s idea doesn’t really matter, as long as the game is fun. Be careful, though, that you begin with only modestly ambitious games, because you’ve already seen how complex even the very simple designs in this book have been to implement.  Creating the Game Design The first part of the process is to think thoroughly about the game’s design. You can do part of this by writing down a summary of the game’s play and goals.   T R I C K  Yes, you really should write down a summary of your idea. Even though you will probably remember it anyway, it is amazing how often experienced programmers lose sight of the main goals of their program. Write down your program’s goals, then paste them on your monitor or somewhere else that draws your attention regularly to help keep yourself focused.  Sketch of Game Games tend to be very visual. In addition to writing down your goals, you should sketch out any of the major screens that you will use. On this sketch, you should write all the most critical elements of game play, even if you aren’t sure that you will implement them. Figure 12.1 shows my example for the Brick game.  Note that I usually do sketches on plain paper, nap- kins, or whatever is handy when inspiration strikes  I haven’t yet resorted to lipstick on a mirror, but it’s an idea . I duplicated the sketch with my draw- ing program, just so you could see what it looks like  and so you will be able to read the handwrit- ing . If you have a friend or two who program, you might want to show them your sketches and ask for some ideas on implementation.  T R A P  Don’t get too caught up at this phase in exactly how you will do things. I made some mention of images and cookies, but that was all. The main thing here is to understand clearly  the  programming problems that you will be facing. You will have plenty of time later in the process to look more closely at the specific details.  IN THE  REAL WORLD  An entire career path exists for those  who  design  and  manage software  projects.  Although techniques for planning physical constructions  such  as  bridges and buildings have been around for a long time, the field of soft- ware  engineering  is  relatively new. This endeavor is dedicated to learning and implementing the best  techniques  for  managing and designing software projects.  291  C h a p t e r   1 2        T h e G a m e C r e a t i o n P r o c e s s        :   T h e B r i c k G a m e     Track lives left  Ball bounces off of walls, bricks, and paddle  Ball’s new angle based on where it hits paddle  Multiple brick colors  Some bricks speed up ball, others change paddle size  Fun backgrounds?

Paddle moves with mouse   292  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Feature List Somewhere, either in your written description or on your sketches, you should have some sort of a feature list. Figure out what your program should do. It is really easy to get carried away with adding features before you’ve done any real programming, so be sure to prioritize your features. You can add “bells and whistles”  animations, fancy sound effects, and so on  later, but the basic game play must be in place before you release the game. However, getting the game to work once isn’t the only goal either. You should conceive your initial design with extensibility in mind.  Think of the mul- tiple tracks in the Racer game, the ability to switch images in the jigsaw puzzle, or the multiple board design that you are about to see implemented in the Brick game.  It takes a little more planning to design a program that you can easily modify, but it almost always turns out to be worth the effort.  Features of the Brick Game Before writing a single line of code, you should set up some reasonable expectations. You will never be completely satisfied with any program that you’ve written, but you should still have some sort of goal in mind, so that you’ll eventually be willing to release the game. Here are the basic objectives that I hope to meet in this version of the Brick game:    The ball should move around the screen bouncing off of walls.   There should be a paddle under user control  using the mouse . User control  should be intuitive.    A bunch of bricks should be at the top of the screen.   When the ball hits a brick, the brick should disappear and the score should incre-  ment. The ball should appear to bounce off the brick.    When the ball hits the paddle, it should bounce. The direction in which the ball  bounces should be based on where it hits the paddle.    If the ball gets past the paddle, the game should reduce the number of lives that  the player has left.    It would be nice to have different types of bricks. Some might speed up the ball,  change the size of the paddle, or change the game’s behavior in other ways.    There should be a number of different initial settings of the bricks, so that the  player won’t get bored too easily.    It would be nice to have an interesting background and good graphics for the ball  and bricks.    A high-score feature using cookies would be nice.  This type of prioritized list, and the accompanying diagram, should give you plenty to start with. If you have such a list of prioritized goals, you should never end up staring at a blank screen, wondering, “What do I do next?”  Setting Up the Playground Once you have some sort of plan in place, you still might wonder what to do first. There are a number of strategies, but the technique that I’ll describe in this chapter is pretty good for moderate-size programs written by one programmer. The technique is a form   293  C h a p t e r   1 2        T h e G a m e C r e a t i o n P r o c e s s        :   T h e B r i c k G a m e     of stepwise refinement. The basic idea is to get something small working, save it, then add a little at a time. You never move ahead on the next part until you have the last part working, so you always have something working that you can fall back on.  The Brick01 Program For my first attempt, I decided simply to get a background screen and a ball on the Web page, with the ball bouncing around. Figure 12.2 shows what I created.  This modest start is admittedly not very glamorous, but it provides a good foundation. It’s nice to start with something simple and make sure that it works well before mov- ing on. Here’s the code:     <script language="Javascript" src=".. gamelib196 gamelib  gamelib_sprites.js">  FIGURE 12.2  The ball is moving, and it bounces off  the screens.             The moving ball  var ball;  var bg;  function init  {     set offsets   294   Sp_xoffset = 100;   Sp_yoffset = 50;   bg.setImage "clouds.gif", 500, 400, 1, 1 ;  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i     set up background   bg = new Sp_Sprite  ;   bg.setXlimits 0, 500 ;   bg.setYlimits 0, 400 ;   bg.setFrame 0 ;   bg.setAnimation 0 ;   bg.moveto 0, 0 ;   bg.switchOn  ;   bg.setZ 0 ;     set up ball   ball = new Sp_Sprite  ;   ball.setXlimits 0, 500 ;   ball.setYlimits 0, 350 ;   ball.setFrame 0 ;   ball.setAnimation 0 ;   ball.collides = true;   ball.bounces = true;   ball.moveto 250, 250 ;   ball.setXYdegs 0 ;   ball.setSpeed 6 ;   ball.switchOn  ;   ball.setZ 99 ;     start up library   Gl_start  ;  }    end init      ball.setImage "ball.gif", 20, 20, 1, 1 ;  I started by including the libraries for the gameLib core and the sprite library. I also set up variables for the ball background. I added an init   function, which is  as usual  tied to the onload event of the body tag.  In the init   function, I set up the sprite offset variables so that the sprites will all appear to be more centered on the page. I also created the background and ball sprites. The ball is set to an initial speed and direction, and its bounces property is set to true. I set the z order of both sprites to ensure that the ball is always visible in front of the background.  Finally, I invoked the Gl_start   function to ensure that the library starts up and that the ball starts to move.   IN THE  REAL WORLD  If you are writing a program as part of a group or for some type of customer, it is important to identify  several  milestones,  or  points  during  the  program’s  development  at  which  you  will have some kind of working prototype to show. The entire project doesn’t need to be done at one  time,  but  you  have  to  be  able  to  demonstrate  your  progress  by  showing  working  ex- amples once in a while  or at least you need to do so if you want the customer’s money to keep flowing into your project .  T R I C K  Although everything in this version of the program is reasonably basic, be sure to test it as soon as you can. Make sure that it’s working before you move on, because things willbreak down later, and you’ll want to be sure that you know the last point at which everything was working correctly.  Adding the Paddle Once you’re sure that you have a solid foundation, you can add elements one or two at a time. I chose next to add the mouse handler, because it would involve some other gameLib elements and because it’s a pretty important part of the game.  Creating the Brick02 Program I imported the mouse library, then created a mouse object. I then made a sprite for the paddle and had the sprite follow the mouse. Figure 12.3 shows these additions.  295  C h a p t e r   1 2        T h e G a m e C r e a t i o n P r o c e s s        :   T h e B r i c k G a m e     FIGURE 12.3  The paddle moves  under mouse control, but the program does not  yet have any  collision detection.   296  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  Note that I’m only concerned that the paddle is moving correctly. I actually had to ma- nipulate the X limits and Y limits of the paddle sprite a little bit to get the behavior that I wanted. I’ll deal with the ball bouncing off the paddle or moving past the paddle later.  T R I C K  Deciding which tasks you’re going to save for later is one of the hardest parts of actual programming. Have a plan and stick with it. In the case of this particular version of the program, for example, it’s okay to ignore collision detection until the paddle is moving correctly.  Adding the mouse handler was simply a matter of importing the mouse library, like this:     I also had to create a variable for the mouse handler outside the functions.     var theMouse;  Finally, I initialized the mouse object in the init   function, as follows:  theMouse = Ms_initmouse  ;  Adding the Paddle Sprite Creating the paddle sprite is reasonably straightforward. I created a suitable image in my paint program, then created a reasonably typical sprite object:    set up paddle   paddle = new Sp_Sprite  ;   paddle.setImage "paddle.gif", 50, 10, 1, 1 ;   paddle.setXlimits 0, 450 ;   paddle.setYlimits 300, 300 ;   paddle.setFrame 0 ;   paddle.setAnimation 0 ;   paddle.follow theMouse, 0, 0 ;   paddle.collides = true;   paddle.switchOn  ;  Note that I set the paddle to follow the mouse. This was the only programming neces- sary to get the paddle working.  Bouncing the Ball off the Paddle Once  the  ball  and  the  paddle  are  working  independently,  it  is  time  to  make  them interact with each other. Remember from the original plan that the ball should bounce off the paddle, but the location of the ball on the paddle should determine the angle at which it bounces.   297  C h a p t e r   1 2        T h e G a m e C r e a t i o n P r o c e s s        :   T h e B r i c k G a m e     FIGURE 12.4  The ball now bounces off the paddle correctly. I added the arrow so you can see how  the ball has bounced off the paddle.  Creating the BrickO3 Program In this version of the program, the ball bounces off the paddle. Hitting the ball near the center of the paddle causes the ball to go straight up. Hitting near the ends of the paddle causes the ball to go in a steep angle to the side. Figure 12.4 shows the ball bouncing at an appropriate angle.  Hooking Up the Main Loop The next order of business is to ensure that the game library calls a main loop func- tion every time that the timer goes off  recall from Chapter 9, “Sprite Animation: The Racer,” that this will be 20 times per second in an ideal situation . This is done by adding the following code to the init   function.  Gl_hook "mainLoop  " ;  Determining the Ball’s New Angle The code inside the main loop  at least for now  is dedicated to checking whether the ball is touching the paddle. Here’s the function:  function mainLoop  {     check ball hits paddle   if  ball.hasHit paddle  {    var ballLoc = ball.x - paddle.x;   298  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i    var ballPerc = ballLoc paddle.width;    var newX =  5 * ballPerc ;    newX = Math.floor newX -1 ;    ball.setDir newX, 0 - ball.ydir ;   }    end if  }    end mainLoop  The function starts by checking whether the ball has hit the paddle. If so, the function does some work to set the ball’s new direction. There are a number of ways to do this, but here’s how I did it. I recalled that you can set a sprite’s direction directly in terms of x and y values to add each time that the timer occurs. To make the ball bounce back up, all I have to do is set the ball’s y direction to its negative value.  The ball will be moving down, so its ydir value will be positive. 0 minus the ydir value will make the ball move at exactly the same speed in the opposite direction.   Setting the x direction proved to be a little trickier. I decided to get the ball’s location on the paddle by subtracting the paddle’s x from the ball’s x. I placed the resulting value in the ballLoc variable. I then divided that value by the length of the paddle to get a percentage value. A value of 0 means that the ball was touching the absolute farthest left pixel of the paddle, and a value of 1 indicates the farthest right pixel. I then multiplied this value by 5 to get a value between 0 and 4. I next eliminated the decimal value and subtracted 1, to get values between –2 and 2. I then set the Xdir of the ball to the appropriate value.  H I N T  Although this algorithm might appear to be completely new, if you look at it a little more closely, you might see that it resembles the strategy used for generating dice introduced in Chapter 6, “Petals around the Rose: Dynamic Output.”  Adding Bricks Getting the paddle and ball to work together is nice, but the name of the game is Bricks, so there should be some bricks somewhere in the game.  Creating the Brick04 Program Bricks aren’t terribly tricky taken one at a time. After all, they are simply sprites. The tricky part is to determine how a group of bricks will work together. It might be easiest to start with just one brick, but I decided to make a bunch of them  see Figure 12.5 . I determined to go with a simple array of bricks for now, but I suspect that I’ll need to make the data structure managing the bricks a little more complex later.  Creating the Simple Brick Array The bricks themselves are an array of sprites. I created the array outside the functions, as follows:  var brick = new Array 8 ;  var numVisible = 8;   299  C h a p t e r   1 2        T h e G a m e C r e a t i o n P r o c e s s        :   T h e B r i c k G a m e     FIGURE 12.5  This version  features one row of bricks. The ball  can hit and destroy them.  In addition to the array of bricks, I created another variable, which will be used to keep track of how many bricks are currently showing on the screen.  Creating the Brick Sprites As usual, an array of sprites is easiest to initialize and work with inside a  for loop. Here’s the code added to the init   function for creating the array of bricks:    brick[i].setImage "brick.gif", 50, 20, 1, 4 ;    set up bricks   for  i = 0; i < 8; i++ {    brick[i] = new Sp_Sprite  ;    brick[i].setXlimits 0, 500 ;    brick[i].setYlimits 0, 200 ;    brick[i].setFrame 0 ;    brick[i].setAnimation 1 ;    brick[i].collides = true;    brick[i].bounces = false;    brick[i].moveto i * 55, 10 ;    brick[i].switchOn  ;   }    end for loop  The brick is a sprite based on a reasonably simple image. I decided to create an image that would be useful in the later stages of game development, when I had multiple bricks. Figure 12.6 shows the image that I created.  For this version of the program, I set all the bricks to the brown animation frame  1 . I used the moveto   method to place the bricks. Each brick is 50 pixels wide, so by mul-   300  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 12.6  The brick image  includes a  transparent version  as well as three  colors of  traditional bricks.  tiplying i  the for loop counter  by 55, the computer will place the bricks five pixels apart. All other settings of the brick sprites are straightforward.  Checking for Brick Collisions The ball should bounce off the brick as well as the paddle, so I had to add some code to the mainloop   function to provide this behavior:    check ball hits brick   for i = 0; i < 8; i++ {    if ball.hasHit brick[i]  {     ball.setDir ball.xdir, 0 - ball.ydir ;     brick[i].switchOff  ;     brick[i].moveTo -100, -100 ;     brick[i].collides = false;     brick[i].setAnimation 0 ;       check for win     numVisible--;     if  numVisible <= 0 {      alert "You win!!" ;     }    end if    }    end 'ball hit brick' if   }    end for loop   IN THE  REAL WORLD  In the spirit of testing one thing at a time, it’s entirely appropri- ate not to worry yet about exactly what happens when the bricks are all gone. You have described what  should  happen  in  your plan, so you don’t need to imple- ment  it  yet.  In  fact,  you shouldn’t,  until  you  know  that the basic brick behavior is work- ing correctly  that is, you need to be sure that the bricks appear, that  they  respond  to  collisions with the ball, and that they go away  appropriately .  You should, however, do something  such as presenting the alert, in this case  that will tell you that the  condition  is  working  cor- rectly. Later on, you can replace that statement with some more robust code.  301  C h a p t e r   1 2        T h e G a m e C r e a t i o n P r o c e s s        :   T h e B r i c k G a m e     I used a for loop to simplify the process of check- ing  all  eight  bricks.  Inside  the  loop,  I  looked  to see whether the ball had hit the current brick. If so, I reversed the ball’s y direction, but left the x direction alone. I turned the brick off, but I have found that this does not always make the sprite disappear, so I also moved it off the playing field, set its collision property to false, then set the sprite to a blank image.  Checking whether All Bricks Are Gone The “ball hit a brick” code is a good place to check for a winning condition, so every time that a brick is hit, I decrement the numVisible variable.  Remem- ber, the init   function set this variable to be equal to the number of bricks visible on the screen.  If numVisible is less than or equal to 0, I’ll tell the user but do nothing else at the moment.  Checking whether the Ball Is Past the Paddle It also makes sense to check for a losing condition. If the ball has gotten past the paddle, you will need to  do  something  as  well.  This  code,  in  the mainLoop   function, does exactly that:    check ball past paddle   if ball.y > 300 {    alert "you lost the ball!" ;    ball.moveTo 200, 250 ;    ball.setXYdegs 0 ;   }    end if  The code is reasonably self-explanatory. If the ball moves past a certain y coordinate, the program informs the user that this has happened. Then the code resets the posi- tion and direction of the ball to put it back into play.  Adding More Bricks and Sound The Brick game is really coming into focus now. All the essential pieces are in place, so you can start adding some of the embellishments. The most important thing to figure out is how to make rows and columns of bricks. As you probably guessed, this involves making the brick array two-dimensional rather than the single dimension that it was in the last iteration. Also, I decided to put the sounds in at this point.  Actually, I handled the two-dimensional array and sound as two separate steps, but combined them in this explanation because they are both fairly straightforward processes.    302  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 12.7  The program has rows and  columns of bricks.  It also features sound effects.  Creating the Brick05 Program This version of the program has a more complex structure of bricks in rows and col- umns. Figure 12.7 shows the structure.  Although you cannot tell from Figure 12.7, the program now has sound effects: When the ball hits a brick, it makes a “tick” sound. When the ball hits the paddle, you hear a “boing” noise, and the game makes a “honk” when the ball moves past the paddle.  Preparing for Two Dimensions of Bricks Converting the brick array from one- to two-dimensional was pretty easy. First, I added a few global variables to make things a little bit easier to follow:  var ROWS = 3;  var COLS = 8;  var NUMBRICKS = ROWS * COLS;  var brick = new Array ROWS ;  var numVisible = NUMBRICKS;  I assigned constants to keep track of the number of rows, columns, and bricks, and changed the brick and numVisible variables to reflect these constants.  T R I C K  Using constants in this way makes your code much easier to change later. If you want to make a different size grid of bricks, you can just change the value of ROWS and COLS, and everything else is done for you.   Creating a Two-Dimensional Array of Bricks You need to update the brick initialization section of the init   function to reflect the two-dimensional array:     brick[row][col].setImage "brick.gif", 50, 20, 1, 4 ;    set up bricks   for  row = 0; row < ROWS; row++ {    brick[row] = new Array COLS ;    for  col = 0; col < COLS; col++ {     brick[row][col] = new Sp_Sprite  ;     brick[row][col].setXlimits 0, 500 ;     brick[row][col].setYlimits 0, 200 ;     brick[row][col].setFrame 0 ;     brick[row][col].setAnimation 1 ;     brick[row][col].collides = true;     brick[row][col].bounces = false;     brick[row][col].moveto col * 55, row * 22 ;     brick[row][col].switchOn  ;    }    end 'col' for loop   }    end 'row' for loop  The Brick05 program replaces the single for loop used in Brick04 with a pair of nested loops. The outside loop steps through the rows. The first thing that the loop does is to create an array for the row. It then steps through each element of this new array, creat- ing a sprite. Since brick is now a two-dimensional array, you must use two indices to refer to any element in the data structure. All the actual properties and settings of each brick sprite remain exactly the same as in Brick04. The only change to this ver- sion is in the way that the bricks are addressed.  Checking whether the Ball Hits a Brick Because the brick data structure is now two-dimensional, you must be careful that all references to it reflect this fact. The program checks every brick in the  mainloop   function, so you must also update the code in that function:  303  C h a p t e r   1 2        T h e G a m e C r e a t i o n P r o c e s s        :   T h e B r i c k G a m e       check ball hits brick   for  row = 0; row < ROWS; row++ {    for  col = 0; col < COLS; col++ {     if ball.hasHit brick[row][col]  {      ball.setDir ball.xdir, 0 - ball.ydir ;      brick[row][col].switchOff  ;      brick[row][col].moveTo -100, -100 ;      brick[row][col].collides = false;      brick[row][col].setAnimation 0 ;      sndTick.play  ;        check for win   304  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i      numVisible--;      if  numVisible <= 0 {       alert "You win!!" ;      }    end if     }    end 'ball hit brick' if    }    end col loop   }    end row loop  This revision is just like the code for Brick04, except that the program now uses two loops and two indices to check for each brick object.  Adding Sound Adding the sound is reasonably simple with gameLib. First I imported the sound library:     Then I created a number of variables to refer to the various sound effects in the game:       sound variables  var sndTick;  var sndHonk;  var sndBoing;  I then initialized all the sounds in the init   function:     set up sounds   sndTick = new Sd_add_sound "tick.wav" ;   sndHonk = new Sd_add_sound "honk.wav" ;   sndBoing = new Sd_add_sound "boing.wav" ;  Finally, I just invoked the appropriate sound’s play   method when I wanted the sound to occur. For example, I added sndTick.play   to the code that occurs whenever the ball hits a brick.  Adding Multiple Game Boards The capability to add multiple-board setups would greatly increase the game’s capabil- ity to keep the player interested, because then it would not always be exactly the same. To perform this feat, I created a new three-dimensional array called board. The board array consists of game boards, and each game board is a two-dimensional array of inte- gers. The program uses the integers to determine how to set up each board.  Creating the Brick06 Program I set up the game with three boards to start with, as shown in Figures 12.8 through 12.10. The game boards will feature different combinations of colored bricks. Later on I’ll set a specific behavior for each brick color. Also, a brick can start out already blank, providing to us the capability to have game boards that start with some bricks missing.   305  C h a p t e r   1 2        T h e G a m e C r e a t i o n P r o c e s s        :   T h e B r i c k G a m e     FIGURE 12.8  This is the first  default  board. All bricks are the  same color.  FIGURE 12.9  Here is the  second board. It features bricks of different colors.   306  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 12.10  This is the third board. It has  different types of bricks and begins with some bricks  already gone.  Setting Up a Three-Dimensional Array First it is necessary to set up  board as a basic array. I made it three elements long, because I will start with three different game boards. Of course, you can change this in your own version of the game.  var boardNum = 0;  var board = new Array 3 ;  The  boardNum variable is used to specify which board is currently being played. The board variable is used to hold the playing-board data.  Setting Up Multiple Boards Because I know before the game begins what data I want in the board array, I’ll use a special trick for filling in the data.    set up boards   board[0] = new Array     new Array 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ,    new Array 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ,    new Array 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1     ;   board[1] = new Array     new Array 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3 ,    new Array 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3 ,   307  C h a p t e r   1 2        T h e G a m e C r e a t i o n P r o c e s s        :   T h e B r i c k G a m e       new Array 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3     ;    ;   board[2] = new Array     new Array 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0 ,    new Array 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0 ,    new Array 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0   Each element of the board array is itself an array of three arrays. The board array ele- ments are in effect two-dimensional arrays. When you call the new Array   command with more than one parameter, JavaScript makes an array with the given values as its initial contents. The numbers represent which brick should be displayed in a given position. Board 2, row 0, column 0, for example, will have no brick, so I put a 0 at that position. I specially set up the brick image so that the 0 image would be transparent and  not  visible  to  the  user.  If  there  is  a  1  in  the  array,  that  specifies  that  the  first animation  a tan brick  should be displayed.  Drawing the Board Once the board array is in place, it is easy to copy the values to the bricks themselves as they are being drawn. This line is all that is needed in init  :    brick[row][col].setAnimation board[boardNum][row][col] ;  This line means the following: “Take the value of brick for board number boardNum, row row, and column col, and set the animation of the brick at row and col to that value.” At this point, the appearance of the brick will change, but the brick’s behavior will not.  Changing the Bricks’ Behavior Now that you can make different types of bricks appear on the screen, you will need to change the behavior of the various bricks.  The Brick07 Program In this latest incarnation of the program, the different types of bricks have different behavior, as shown in Figure 12.11.  A  switch statement in the  mainloop   function affects all the behavior. After deter- mining that the ball has hit a brick, the program determines what type of brick was hit by examining the animpos property of the current brick sprite.    deal with special bricks      switch brick[row][col].animpos {       case 1:          brown: normal ball speed, paddle size        paddle.resize 50, 10 ;        ball.setSpeed 6 ;        break;   308  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  FIGURE 12.11  After hitting a red brick, the ball gets faster. After hitting a  silver brick, the  paddle gets smaller.       case 2:          blue: smaller paddle        paddle.resize 30, 10 ;        break;       case 3:          red: faster ball        ball.setSpeed 8 ;        break;      }    end switch      brick[row][col].setAnimation 0 ;      sndTick.play  ;  The actions associated with each type of brick are not too complicated. It would be an easy matter to add new brick types with all kinds of strange behavior, such as a brick that reverses gravity or that causes the paddle to move backward.  Adding Scorekeeping Functionality The game is getting close to completion. It is time to add the ability to keep score. The actual scorekeeping functionality is not tricky, but displaying the score in a way that is informative and not distracting is a little more challenging. I chose to use a layer for scorekeeping, because it allows a lot of flexibility without a lot of work.   309  C h a p t e r   1 2        T h e G a m e C r e a t i o n P r o c e s s        :   T h e B r i c k G a m e     FIGURE 12.12  In this game, the player has scored some points and has  three lives left.  The Brick08 Program This version of the Brick program sports the classic icon-based life indicator  three balls in the corner means that the player has three lives left  and a scoreboard indicat- ing the player’s numeric score  see Figure 12.12 .  Adding Some Scorekeeping Variables Like many variables, the variables for scorekeeping are set up outside the functions:    utility variables  var lyrScore;  var score = 0;  var ballsLeft = 3;  The lyrScore variable is a reference to a layer object that displays the score. The score variable contains the actual score, and the ballsLeft variable keeps track of how many lives the player has remaining. The program changes these variables when the appro- priate events occur. The game increments  score whenever a brick is hit and decre- ments ballsLeft whenever the ball moves past the paddle.  Setting Up the Scoreboard Layer The program communicates the score to the player by updating the  lyrScore layer. Here’s the code that creates the layer:    set up scoreboard   lyrScore = new Gl_layer 10, 10, 100, "Hi there!" ;   310  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i   lyrScore.setXlimits 0,500 ;   lyrScore.setYlimits 0, 200 ;   lyrScore.show  ;   updateScore  ;  The code sets up the layer in the usual way, at coordinates  10, 10 , width 100, and with the initial value “Hi there!”  The actual HTML text of the scoreboard is created in the updateScore   function, which the program calls whenever the score needs to be updated.  Writing the updateScore   Function The updateScore   function does the actual work of updating the score layer:  function updateScore  {   var scoreText = "";   scoreText += " ";   scoreText += "Score: ";   scoreText += score;    scoreText += " ";   }    end for loop   scoreText += " ";   lyrScore.write scoreText ;  }    end updateScore   scoreText += "  ";   for  i = 0; i < ballsLeft; i++ {    scoreText += " ";  The scoreText variable contains all the HTML for the scoreboard. The function concat- enates the numeric score into the HTML right after the text  "Score:  ". To get the appropriate number of ball icons to appear, I made a for loop that executes as many times as the ballsLeft variable indicates. For each ball remaining, the function adds another   tag of a ball to the scoreText variable.  At the end of the function, I simply wrote the value of the scoreText variable to lyrScore using the layer’s write   method.  Reorganizing and Cleaning Up The Brick program is really coming along, but it is starting to become unwieldy. The program is heavily concentrated in two functions, and each function is becoming sev- eral pages of code long.  Managing the game will become difficult if it gets any longer, so it is probably a good time to reorganize a little bit. Figure 12.13 shows what I did to reorganize the program’s internal design. I did not add much code or new functionality to this version, but I did rearrange things and add comments. Taking the time to reorganize the game provides   311  C h a p t e r   1 2        T h e G a m e C r e a t i o n P r o c e s s        :   T h e B r i c k G a m e     FIGURE 12.13  I changed the  background color and some other  cosmetics, but most of the new work is behind the scenes.  T R I C K              a good opportunity to check the game’s progress, because it requires that you discover and evaluate what your program is doing and how well it is doing it.  The technique described in this section is called encapsulation. The basic idea is to take a function that has become large and unwieldy and break it into a number of smaller, self-contained segments. The advantage of this approach is that your code will presum- ably be in smaller segments that are easier to read, understand, and debug.  Note that I have already explained most of the code, so in the following section I will comment only on the things that I did to improve the program.  Library Calls The Brick program now relies on four gameLib libraries:     <script language="Javascript" src=".. gamelib196 gamelib  gamelib_sprites.js">         Variable Creation I moved around some of the variables and put them in commented groups based on their functions:  312  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i  var NUMBRICKS = ROWS * COLS;    constants  var ROWS = 3;  var COLS = 8;    basic sprites  var ball;  var bg;  var paddle;  var brick = new Array ROWS ;    utility variables  var numVisible = NUMBRICKS;  var lyrScore;  var score = 0;  var ballsLeft = 3;    the gameboard  var board = new Array 3 ;  var boardNum = 0;    sound variables  var sndTick;  var sndHonk;  var sndBoing;  function init  {     set offsets   Sp_xoffset = 100;   Sp_yoffset = 50;     initialize mouse   theMouse = Ms_initmouse  ;   setupSprites  ;  The init   Function One of my goals was to break down the  init   and  mainloop   functions so that they contain only essential statements and calls to other functions. Here’s how I broke up init  :   313  C h a p t e r   1 2        T h e G a m e C r e a t i o n P r o c e s s        :   T h e B r i c k G a m e      setupBoards  ;   setupBricks  ;   updateBricks  ;     set up sounds   sndTick = new Sd_add_sound "tick.wav" ;   sndHonk = new Sd_add_sound "honk.wav" ;   sndBoing = new Sd_add_sound "boing.wav" ;     set up scoreboard   lyrScore = new Gl_layer 10, 200, 100, "Hi there!" ;   lyrScore.setXlimits 0,500 ;   lyrScore.setYlimits 0, 200 ;   lyrScore.show  ;   updateScore  ;     start up library   Gl_hook "mainLoop  " ;   Gl_start  ;  }    end init  I still used init   to set up the simpler elements, such as the scoreboard layer and the sound variables, but I delegated all the more complex setup tasks to their own functions.  The setupSprites   Function The  setupSprites   function has the sole purpose of setting up most of the sprites  except the brick sprites, which have their own setup function :   bg.setImage "clouds.gif", 500, 400, 1, 1 ;  function setupSprites  {     set up background   bg = new Sp_Sprite  ;   bg.setXlimits 0, 500 ;   bg.setYlimits 0, 400 ;   bg.setFrame 0 ;   bg.setAnimation 0 ;   bg.moveto 0, 0 ;   bg.switchOn  ;   bg.setZ 0 ;     set up ball   ball = new Sp_Sprite  ;   ball.setImage "ball.gif", 20, 20, 1, 1 ;   314  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i   ball.setXlimits 0, 500 ;   ball.setYlimits 0, 350 ;   ball.setFrame 0 ;   ball.setAnimation 0 ;   ball.collides = true;   ball.bounces = true;   ball.moveto 250, 250 ;   ball.setXYdegs 0 ;   ball.setSpeed 6 ;   ball.switchOn  ;   ball.setZ 99 ;     set up paddle   paddle = new Sp_Sprite  ;   paddle.setXlimits 0, 450 ;   paddle.setYlimits 300, 300 ;   paddle.setFrame 0 ;   paddle.setAnimation 0 ;   paddle.follow theMouse, 0, 0 ;   paddle.collides = true;   paddle.switchOn  ;  }   end setupSprites   paddle.setImage "paddle.gif", 50, 10, 1, 1 ;  function setupBoards  {     set up boards   board[0] = new Array     new Array 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ,    new Array 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ,    new Array 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1     ;    ;   board[1] = new Array     new Array 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3 ,    new Array 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3 ,    new Array 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3    board[2] = new Array   The setupBoards   Function The setupBoards   function manages all of the board setup, which is the creation of that three-dimensional array of bricks:   315  C h a p t e r   1 2        T h e G a m e C r e a t i o n P r o c e s s        :   T h e B r i c k G a m e       new Array 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0 ,    new Array 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0 ,    new Array 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0     ;  }    end setupBoards  The setupBricks   Function The setupBricks   function initializes the brick sprites:  function setupBricks  {     set up bricks   for  row = 0; row < ROWS; row++ {    brick[row] = new Array COLS ;   }    end 'row' for loop  }    end setupBricks  The updateBricks   Function The updateBricks   function sets up the bricks according to the current board vari- able by looking at the board array.  function updateBricks  {     set up bricks     destroy old bricks   brick = null;   brick = new Array COLS ;   numVisible = NUMBRICKS;   for  row = 0; row < ROWS; row++ {    brick[row] = null;    brick[row] = new Array COLS ;    for  col = 0; col < COLS; col++ {     brick[row][col] = new Sp_Sprite  ;     brick[row][col].setXlimits 0, 500 ;     brick[row][col].setYlimits 0, 200 ;     brick[row][col].setFrame 0 ;     if  brick[row][col].animpos == 0 {      numVisible--;      brick[row][col].switchOff  ;      brick[row][col].moveTo -100, -100 ;      brick[row][col].collides = false;     }    end if     brick[row][col].collides = true;     brick[row][col].setImage "brick.gif", 50, 20, 1, 4 ;     brick[row][col].setAnimation board[boardNum][row][col] ;   316  l  i  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i     brick[row][col].bounces = false;     brick[row][col].moveto col * 55, row * 22 ;     brick[row][col].switchOn  ;    }    end 'col' for loop   }    end 'row' for loop  }    end setupBricks  H I N T  Note that I did some memory management tricks. I attempted to destroy each old row and sprite before re-creating them by assigning null to the appropriate vari- ables. The game appears to get more sluggish as it goes on. I suspect that this is because JavaScript does not have sophisticated techniques for reclaiming memory when a program finishes with a particular array, and it is making multiple copies of the brick array. Assigning null to the values seems to help, but it does not com- pletely alleviate the problem.  The updateScore   Function You’ve already seen the  updateScore   function, but I made some minor modifica- tions to the HTML that it generates:  function updateScore  {   var scoreText = "";   scoreText += " ";   scoreText += "Score: ";   scoreText += score;   scoreText += "  ";    scoreText += " ";   }    end for loop   scoreText += " ";   lyrScore.write scoreText ;  }    end updateScore  function mainLoop  {   ballHitPaddle  ;   ballHitBrick  ;   ballPastPaddle  ;  }    end mainLoop   for  i = 0; i < ballsLeft; i++ {    scoreText += " ";  The mainLoop   Function Again, the  mainLoop   function was getting a little long and complex, so I broke it down into a few major tasks and put each of them into its own function:   C h a p t e r   1 2        T h e G a m e C r e a t i o n P r o c e s s        :   T h e B r i c k G a m e     The ballHitPaddle   Function The  ballHitPaddle   function encapsulates all the action required to check for the ball hitting the paddle:  317  The ballHitBrick   Function The code for the ballHitBrick   function checks whether the ball hit a brick. It also calls a function that checks for a winning condition  that is, that all the bricks are gone :  function ballHitPaddle  {     check ball hits paddle   if  ball.hasHit paddle  {    sndBoing.play  ;    var ballLoc = ball.x - paddle.x;    var ballPerc = ballLoc paddle.width;    var newX =  5 * ballPerc ;    newX = Math.floor newX -1 ;    ball.setDir newX, 0 - ball.ydir ;   }    end if  }    end ballHitPaddle  function ballHitBrick  {     check ball hits brick   for  row = 0; row < ROWS; row++ {    for  col = 0; col < COLS; col++ {     if ball.hasHit brick[row][col]  {      updateScore  ;      ball.setDir ball.xdir, 0 - ball.ydir ;      brick[row][col].switchOff  ;      brick[row][col].moveTo -100, -100 ;      brick[row][col].collides = false;        deal with special bricks      switch brick[row][col].animpos {       case 1:          brown: normal ball speed, paddle size        paddle.resize 50, 10 ;        ball.setSpeed 6 ;        score += 10;        break;       case 2:          blue: smaller paddle        paddle.resize 30, 10 ;        score += 20;        break;       case 3:   318  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i          red: faster ball        ball.setSpeed 8 ;        score += 30;        break;      }    end switch      brick[row][col].setAnimation 0 ;      sndTick.play  ;      checkWin  ;     }    end 'ball hit brick' if    }    end col loop   }    end row loop  }    end ballHitBrick  function ballPastPaddle  {     check ball past paddle   if ball.y > 300 {    sndHonk.play  ;    ball.moveTo 200, 250 ;    ball.setXYdegs 0 ;    ballsLeft--;    updateScore  ;   }    end if  The ballPastPaddle   Function The ballPastPaddle   function checks whether the ball has gone past the paddle:  Using a Cookie to Track the High Score At this point, I was pretty satisfied with the game. However, after returning to the sketch that I drew at the beginning of the project, I decided the game needed one more feature to be complete. The only feature not in place was the ability to add a high score using a cookie  see Figure 12.14 . Fortunately, the reorganization of the program that I did in the last step made modification much simpler.  Initializing the Cookie The process for using a cookie is just like the one used in Chapter 11. I added a cookie variable:    high score stuff  var scoreCookie;  var highScore = 0;  The  scoreCookie variable will contain a reference to a cookie object. The  highScore variable will contain  you guessed it  the high score.   319  C h a p t e r   1 2        T h e G a m e C r e a t i o n P r o c e s s        :   T h e B r i c k G a m e     FIGURE 12.14  Now the program keeps track of the high score between visits to the game.  Getting the High Score I added some code to the init   function that checks the cookie for a previous high- score value and loads it into the highScore variable.    get high score   scoreCookie = new Gl_cookie "brick score" ;   if  scoreCookie.value == null {    highScore = 0;   } else {   }    end if   updateScore  ;    highScore = parseInt scoreCookie.value ;  If the cookie has no previous value, the function returns null. So I trapped for that value, then instead sent the value 0 to highScore.  Improving the Code Used at the End of Game The code that handled the end of the game was pretty weak, so I spruced it up a little bit:    check for end of game    if  ballsLeft <=0 {     alert "Game Over!" ;     if  score > highScore {      highScore = score;   320  i  l  r e n n g e B   e t u o s b A   e h t   r o f   g n m m a r g o r P   t p i r c S a v a J  i      alert "New High Score!!" ;      scoreCookie.setvalue score ;      updateScore  ;     }    end 'high score' if     score = 0;     ballsLeft = 3;     boardNum = 1;     updateScore  ;     updateBricks  ;    }    end 'game over' if  Once  the  game  is  over,  the  program  informs  the  user  of  his  or  her  bad  luck,  then checks  the  current  score  against  the  high  score.  If  the  player  achieved  a  new  high score, the function stores the new high score in the cookie.  Summary Although this chapter didn’t introduce much code syntax that was new, you still man- aged to cover a lot of ground. You looked at the design and creation of a program from the ground up. You looked at the stepwise refinement technique for building programs. You learned a bit about refinement techniques and encapsulation. You saw a program grow from a simple idea to a workable, if not completely polished, game. You have come a very long way in a short time. You should be extremely proud of yourself.  1.
