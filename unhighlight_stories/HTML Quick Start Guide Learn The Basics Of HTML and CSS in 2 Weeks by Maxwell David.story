I	want	to	thank	you	and	congratulate	you	for	downloading	the	book,	“HTML:	Learn	the Basics	of	HTML	Programming	in	2	Weeks!”  These	days,	using	the	internet	is	more	than	just	a	luxury:	it’s	a	necessity.	Sometimes,	work cannot	be	done	without	doing	research	on	the	internet,	but	as	someone	who’s	interested	in programming,	 have	 you	 ever	 wondered	 how	 those	 websites	 work	 and	 what	 goes	 on	 in them?  For	 starters,	 every	 website	 you	 see	 works	 because	 of	 a	 programming	 language	 called HTML,	or	Hyper	Text	Markup	Language.	Without	HTML,	websites	would	not	work	as fast	as	they	could,	and	would	not	provide	you	with	images,	videos,	or	even	audio.	In	short, those	websites	won’t	be	as	easy	to	navigate	and	easy	on	the	eyes	as	they	could	be.  But,	with	the	help	of	this	book,	you’ll	learn	the	basics	of	HTML	programming	in	just	a matter	 of	 2	 weeks—so	 you	 can	 start	 to	 make	 your	 own	 webpages,	 and	 in	 time,	 a	 full website,	too!  Read	this	book	now	to	find	out	how.  Thanks	again	for	downloading	this	book,	I	hope	you	enjoy	it!   	Copyright	2014	by	______________________	-	All	rights	reserved.

Week	1  Chapter	1:	A	Brief	History	of	HTML 	  On	the	first	week	of	the	lesson,	it’s	best	that	you	first	get	to	know	what	HTML	is	really about.  HTML	stands	for	Hyper	Text	Markup	Language,	which	consists	of	a	set	of	markup	tags, and	are	described	by	HTML	tags.  Markup	 tags	 make	 up	 the	 foundation	 of	 HTML	 where	 the	 use	 of	 nesting	 lines,	 such	 as  	 or	  	 are	 prevalent.	 This	 makes	 it	 a	 cornerstone	 technology,	 together with	JavaScript	and	CSS.	This	makes	it	easy	for	what’s	on	the	web	to	also	be	shown	on mobile	devices—which	is	important	these	days	because	everyone’s	mostly	on	their	phones or	 tablets,	 and	 that	 is	 why	 you	 have	 to	 make	 sure	 that	 the	 websites	 you	 create	 are optimized	for	mobile	devices.  The	development	of	HTML	is	widely	attributed	to	Tim	Berners-Lee,	also	known	as	the creator	of	the	World	Wide	Web	 www .	Back	in	1989,	he	was	still	a	contractor	as	CERN, and	while	working	there,	he	wrote	a	memorandum	proposing	for	a	hypertext	system	that will	be	based	on	the	internet.  He	then	began	to	write	server	and	browser	software	based	on	HTML	back	in	the	1990s, and	also	created	an	encyclopedia	based	on	it	that	CERN	used	as	the	foundation	for	the websites	they	created.  Berners-Lee	 was	 also	 the	 first	 one	 to	 use	 the	 term	 HTML	 Tags	 as	 the	 first	 available description	of	HTML.	It	was	composed	of	18	essential	elements	that	made	up	the	relative HTML	design,	and	11	of	these	elements	are	still	used	up	to	this	day	and	age.  HTML	 was	 also	 defined	 for	 a	 time	 as	 one	 of	 the	 main	 applications	 of	 SGML,	 or Standardized	Generalized	Markup	Language.	It	stayed	that	way	up	until	1993	when	the first	HTML	Draft	for	the	internet	came	into	fruition.	However,	it	just	had	to	take	6	months before	the	said	draft	expired.  In	 1994,	 the	 HTML	 Working	 Group	 was	 created	 and	 in	 turn,	 HTML	 2.0	 was	 finally completed	 in	 1995,	 and	 in	 1996,	 specifications	 for	 HTML	 started	 to	 be	 maintained.	 In 1999,	HTML	4.1	was	published,	and	in	2004,	HTML	5	began	to	be	developed—proving how	innovative	the	said	language	is.   Interactive	forms,	objects,	and	images	are	then	easily	embedded	to	websites	with	the	help of	HTML.	Then,	with	the	help	of	structural	semantics.	Quotes,	links,	lists,	and	paragraphs are	all	embedded,	as	well.	HTML	also	works	with	JavaScript	and	CSS	in	such	a	way	that browsers	would	be	able	to	have	scripts	embedded	in	them.  Ever	 since	 1997,	 programmers	 were	 encouraged	 to	 use	 HTML	 instead	 of	 CSS	 or Cascading	Style	Sheets	for	websites.   Chapter	2:	Framework	and	Tags	Cheat	Sheet 	 The	framework	of	HTML	is	made	up	of	the	following:  1.	The	document	type	is	described	with	the	DOCTYPE	declaration.  2.	Document	information	is	provided	in	the	text	between	 	and	 .  3.	An	HTML	document	is	described	in	the	text	between	 	and	 .  4.	The	document’s	title	is	provided	in	the	text	between	 	and	 .  5.	The	text	between	 	and	 	are	known	as	headings.	It	could	also	go	for	H2,	H3, H4,	and	so	on.  6.	The	content	of	the	document—or	what	you’d	read	onscreen—goes	on	the	text	between  	and	 .  7.	And,	a	paragraph	could	then	be	created	in	the	text	between	 	and	   Tags	Cheat	Sheet  Now,	when	it	comes	to	tags,	you	have	to	keep	in	mind	that	they	usually	come	in	pairs,	as you	have	seen	in	the	framework	above.	What’s	on	the	left	side	is	the	beginning	of	the	tag  also	known	as	start	tag ,	and	the	end	tag	looks	almost	the	same—but	only	with	a	slash	    in	the	beginning.  Here	are	the	tags	that	you’re	mostly	going	to	use:     NAME	–	this	pertains	to	a	section	on	the	page  HREF	–	this	is	used	for	hyperlinking,	or	for	adding	the	name	of	the	URL	that	you are	referring	to  onCLICK	–	this	is	the	script	that	runs	so	that	the	user	will	be	able	to	click	on	the anchor	 i.e.,	for	things	such	as	google.com,	this	script	has	to	run	so	that	the	user would	really	be	directed	to	a	link	after	clicking    	Anchor  TITLE	–	this	is	the	title	of	the	document	that	is	being	opened            onMOUSEOUT	–	this	is	the	script	used	to	determine	that	the	mouse	is	no	longer on	the	anchor	text  TARGET	–	This	shows	the	window	where	the	document	has	to	go	into.	Variations include:	“parent”		“black”		“top”		“shelf”		window	name  onMOUSEOVER	–	this	shows	that	the	mouse	is	right	over	the	anchor	text  CODEBASE	–	this	is	the	path	that	would	take	you	to	the	applet	class  CODE	–	this	determines	the	app	that	is	currently	running  HEIGHT	–	the	height	of	the	applet  WIDTH	–	this	determines	the	applet’s	width  ALIGN	–	this	would	determine	how	the	surrounding	text	would	show	up	onscreen  HSPACE	–	this	is	the	horizontal	space	between	the	surrounding	text	and	the	applet  VSPACE	–	this	is	the	vertical	space	between	the	surrounding	text	and	the	applet  NAME	–	this	is	the	name	given	to	an	applet	and	is	also	the	name	used	by	other applets	that	are	referencing	it  BORDER	–	this	is	the	empty	space	that	surrounds	the	applet  ARCHIVE	–	this	is	a	collection	of	the	components	of	the	applet	that	have	been compressed	into	one  HREF	–	this	determines	the	URL	that	you	are	linking	to  MAYSCRIPT	–	This	shows	whether	Java	can	use	JavaScript	or	not  ALT	 –	 this	 is	 the	 alternate	 text	 used	 for	 when	 the	 image	 has	 not	 been	 properly displayed  SHAPE	 –	 this	 determines	 the	 shape	 of	 the	 area	 that’s	 shown	 onscreen.	 It	 could either	be	one	of	the	following:	POLY		RECT		CIRCLE		DEFAULT  COORDS	–	these	determine	the	coordinates	for	the	shapes	in	the	link	area      TARGET	–	this	determines	the	frame	that	you	have	to	go	to  TITLE	–	this	is	a	short	description	of	the	area	being	used  onCLICK	–	this	script	should	run	while	the	user	is	hovering	on	the	anchor	text  NOHREF	–	this	means	that	there	are	no	links	contained	in	a	certain	area   	BOLD   	Base	Address     TARGET	 -	 This	 shows	 the	 window	 where	 the	 document	 has	 to	 go	 into.	 Variations  include:	“parent”		“black”		“top”		“shelf”		window	name  SRC	–	this	determines	audio	or	sound	URL  FACE	–	the	typeface	or	font	of	the	project  COLOR	–	this	is	the	color	of	the	typeface  SIZE	–	font	size	that	is	being	used        LOOP														-	this	determines	the	number	of	times	audio	or	video	is	being	played  ENCTYPE	–	this	is	the	type	of	form	being	used	on	the	page  onRESET	–	this	is	the	script	that	should	run	if	the	form	is	being	reset  SRC	–	this	is	the	type	of	file	that	has	to	be	added	to	the	frame  onSUBMIT	–	this	should	run	while	the	form	is	being	submitted  SCROLLING	 –	 this	 determines	 whether	 the	 form	 should	 use	 a	 scrollbar	 or	 not   answerable	with	YES	or	NO   MARGINWIDTH	–	this	determines	the	width	of	the	form’s	margins  MARGINHEIGHT	–	this	determines	the	height	of	the	form’s	margins  ROWS	–	the	number	of	rows	in	the	frame  COLS	–	the	number	of	columns	in	the	frame   													   NOSHADE	–	this	means	that	the	shadow	effect	should	not	be	used  COLOR	–	the	color	of	the	line   	inline	frame  ALT	–	this	would	show	up	onscreen	in	the	event	that	the	image	doesn’t  LONGDESC	–	this	is	a	long	description	of	the	image	that	is	being	used  SUPPRESS	 –	 this	 means	 that	 the	 image’s	 icons	 won’t	 show	 up	 until	 it’s downloaded  MEDIA	–	this	determines	the	type	of	media	that	is	being	linked	to.	It	could	be	one of	the	following:	PRINT		PROJECTION		SCREEN		ALL		BRAILLE		AURAL  TYPE	–	this	is	the	kind	of	link	resource	that’s	being	used  BEHAVIOR	–	the	type	of	scrolling	used  GUTTER	–	this	determines	the	space	between	the	columns   	Ordered	List  right  VALUE	–	this	determines	the	value	of	the	option	that	the	user	is	choosing  START	–	this	shows	you	where	you	have	to	start	counting  ALIGN	 –	 this	 means	 that	 you	 want	 to	 align	 the	 paragraph	 whether	 to	 the	 left	 or	 the  LANGUAGE	–	this	is	the	scripting	language	used	 JAVA,	CSS,	etc   BG	–	the	background	color	used  BACKGROUND	–	the	picture	you	want	to	use	as	the	background	of	the	page  BORDERCOLOR	–	the	color	of	the	border	on	the	page  TYPE	 –	 the	 type	 of	 bullets	 used.	 This	 could	 be	 one	 of	 the	 following:	 SQUARE	   CIRCLE		DISC  Now	 that’s	 clear,	 it’s	 time	 to	 start	 putting	 into	 practice	 what	 you	 have	 learned!	 Don’t worry	because	you’ll	be	guided	through	it!   Chapter	3:	Using	HTML	Editors 	 Before	coding	HTML,	you	first	have	to	open	the	right	editors	for	them.	While	Sublime Text	and	Microsoft	WebMatrix	are	popularly	used	by	professionals,	as	a	beginner,	you	can use	Notepad.  For	 Windows	 7	 and	 earlier	 versions,	 just	 click	 Start,	 followed	 by	 All	 Programs	 > Accessories	>	Notepad.  For	Windows	8	and	other	newer	versions,	click	Start	Screen	>	Notepad.  Now,	try	typing	this	into	the	Notepad:          Welcome	to	the	Web    My	first	page        Then,	save	the	page	by	selecting	File	>	Save	As,	and	choose	UTF-8.	However,	if	you’re going	to	use	Western	European	and	US	Characters,	just	choose	ANSI.  To	view	the	page	that	you	have	made	in	your	browser,	just	click	and	watch	a	page	open	on your	browser.   Chapter	4:	Vital	HTML	Page 	 Now	it’s	time	to	start	creating	a	full	basic	HTML	page	just	to	see	how	it	looks	like.	Again, remember	that	every	HTML	page	or	document	should	start	with	 .	This means	that	it	has	to	look	something	like	this:          Welcome	to	the	Web    My	first	page        Take	note	that	declarations	would	differ	depending	on	the	HTML	type	that	you’re	using. This	means	that	you	have	to	do	the	following:  1.	 XHTML	 1.0:	 <!DOCTYPE	 html	 PUBLIC	 “-  W3C  DTD	 XHTML	 1.0 Transitional  EN”	“http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd”>  2.	 HTML	 4.01:	 <!DOCTYPE	 HTML	 PUBLIC	 “-  W3C  DTD	 HTML	 4.01 Transitional  EN”	“http:  www.w3.org TR html4 loose.dtd”>  3.	HTML	5:	    The	Headings  Of	course,	your	pages	need	headings.	These	work	like	subheadings	in	books	or	articles	so you’d	know	exactly	what	goes	on	in	a	page—what	it’s	about,	in	other	words.  Headings	range	from	 	to	 .	Here’s	a	good	example:   Look	at	my	heading   Look	at	my	heading   Look	at	my	heading    Look	at	my	heading   Look	at	my	heading   Look	at	my	heading   	   Paragraphs  Paragraphs	are	also	used	in	webpages	as	well	as	in	articles	and	novels.	You’ll	know	that	a paragraph	 is	 around	 when	 the	  	 tag	 is	 in.	 This	 also	 makes	 it	 easier	 for	 you	 to	 read what’s	on	the	page.  Without	the	use	of	paragraphs,	everything	would	be	cramped	in	one	space	along—making them	extremely	hard	to	read.	For	this,	you	could	try	the	following:   Read	this	paragraph.   Read	one	more	paragraph.    Images  Images	could	also	be	used	to	spruce	up	your	website.	It	makes	people	want	to	read	the website	 more	 because	 images	 always	 make	 things	 easy	 on	 the	 eyes.	 This	 means	 you’d have	to	use	the	 	tag	for	this.  The	attributes	of	this	are	as	follows:  1.	alt	 alternate	text   2.	src	 image	source   3.	size	 width	and	height   For	example:      Links  And	of	course,	the	use	of	links	is	also	encouraged.	These	are	defined	with	the	 	tag.	It makes	 things	 easy	 on	 the	 eyes	 so	 that	 everything	 wouldn’t	 be	 on	 one	 page	 alone,	 and readers	could	be	taken	to	different	pages	on	your	website.  Here’s	a	good	example:   See	this	link    Elements  Various	elements	are	also	used	in	an	HTML	page.	If	you	could	remember,	pairs	of	tags	are always	used	in	a	webpage	that’s	been	coded	with	HTML.  It	should	look	something	like	this:   tagname   For	example:   	Read	this	heading	    	Have	you	seen	the	light?	     What	is	feminism?    So	basically,	the	whole	document	is	depicted	through	various	 	tags,	and	that’s why	start	 	and	end	 	tags	have	to	be	used.	Without	them,	words	on	the	page	would	all come	together—making	them	hard	to	read.	The	 	tag	then	defines	what	the	page contains.	It	also	contains	headings,	paragraphs,	and	other	attributes.  For	example:             My	Sunday   Last	Sunday	was	the	best	Sunday	because	we	went	to	the	park	and	flew	kites.    With	the	help	of	start	and	end	tags,	you	get	to	understand	what’s	being	shown	onscreen. They	give	a	page	a	lot	of	meaning—instead	of	it	being	just	mumbo-jumbo.  Other	 important	 elements	 are	 the	 headings	  ,	 and	 paragraphs	  	 so	 that	 headings could	also	be	defined.	A	sample	of	headings	are	as	follows:   	See	how	awesome	this	is	    	Have	you	seen	where	she	went?	    	Where	will	you	go	next?	    In	between	those	headings,	you	could	write	what	you	have	in	mind—which	then	would give	the	webpage	a	better,	more	believable	look!	For	example:   	what	will	you	watch?	    	what	are	you	listening	to?	    	what	are	you	going	to	eat?	    	See	how	awesome	this	is	    	I	see	how	awesome	this	is	and	I	like	it	    	Have	you	seen	where	she	went?	    	No,	I	have	no	idea	where	she	went	    	Where	will	you	go	next?	    	what	will	you	watch?	    	Lion	King	or	Cats	    	what	are	you	listening	to?	    	I’m	planning	to	go	to	Chicago,	then	maybe	do	a	side	trip	to	New	York	to	catch a	show	on	Broadway	    	I’m	listening	to	the	new	Selena	Gomez	record.	So	far,	so	good	    	what	are	you	going	to	eat?	    	I’m	going	to	eat	some	omelet	and	buttered	vegetables	   See	how	much	of	a	difference	that	makes?  You	should	also	keep	in	mind	that	there	are	such	things	as	empty	HTML	elements.	This basically	pertains	to	the	br	tag	 	which	also	depicts	a	line	break.	It’s	pretty	much	like	a space,	if	you’re	going	to	think	of	articles	or	books.  For	example:   	See	how	awesome	this	is	            	I	see	how	awesome	this	is	and	I	like	it	    	Have	you	seen	where	she	went?	     	I’m	planning	to	go	to	Chicago,	then	maybe	do	a	side	trip	to	New	York	to	catch a	show	on	Broadway	    	No,	I	have	no	idea	where	she	went	    	Where	will	you	go	next?	    	what	will	you	watch?	    	Lion	King	or	Cats	    	what	are	you	listening	to?	                    	I’m	listening	to	the	new	Selena	Gomez	record.	So	far,	so	good	    	what	are	you	going	to	eat?	    	I’m	going	to	eat	some	omelet	and	buttered	vegetables	   Also,	you	have	to	remember	that	while	tags	are	not	case-sensitive,	it’s	still	better	to	use lowercase	tags	especially	in	HTML	4	and	5—which	are	commonly	used	these	days.	This way,	you	avoid	problems	from	happening	to	your	page.    Week	2  Chapter	5:	HTML	Attributes 	 Then,	 on	 the	 second	 week	 of	 the	 lesson,	 you	 can	 start	 learning	 how	 to	 code	 the	 more complicated	parts	of	HTML.	For	this,	you	could	start	with	Attributes.  The	most	important	things	you	have	to	remember	about	Attributes	are	as	follows:  1.	 Elements	 of	 HTML	 could	 have	 attributes—and	 attributes	 help	 explain	 the	 elements better.  2.	The	Start	Tag	 	specifies	the	attributes.  3.	 Attributes	 also	 come	 in	 name value	 pairs.	 They’d	 look	 something	 like	 this:	 name= “value”	 i.e.,	img	src	=	“1gdtjs.tumblr.com   Now,	you	can	take	a	look	at	various	types	of	attributes	below:   Title	Attribute  Again,	paragraphs	are	defined	by	the	 	tag.	However,	you	could	also	insert	the	title	of your	topic	in	the	page	inside	the	paragraph.	You	could	try	the	example	below:    After	6	years	of	scheming	and	failed	plans,	Gossip	Girl	finally	introduced	herself —or	himself,	rather—to	the	Non-Judging	Breakfast	Club.	People	were	surprised	to see	that	Gossip	Girl	is	actually	non	other	than	Dan	Humphrey,	everyone’s	favorite guy	from	Brooklyn.	The	guy	from	the	outside	actually	wanted	to	be	in!	    Lang	Attribute  The	HTML	tag	declares	the	kind	of	language	that’s	used	in	the	document.	This	is	essential so	that	applications	will	be	accessible—even	in	different	kinds	of	gadgets.	Remember	that the	 first	 two	 letters	 after	 html	lang	will	 determine	 the	 type	 of	 language	 used.	 If	 you’re using	a	dialect,	you	have	to	add	two	more	letters.  For	example:	en-US	 English-US ,	en-UK	 English-UK ,	etc.  To	make	it	clearer,	just	look	at	the	sample	below:               Who	is	Gossip	Girl?   Does	anyone	know	who	Gossip	Girl	is	and	where	she	could	be	found?    Size	Attributes  For	example:  	  The	 	tag	define	the	images	shown	on	the	HTML	Page.  Src	 then	 determines	 where	 the	 file	 has	 been	 sourced	 from,	 and	 the	 image’s	 width	 and height	are	also	taken	into	consideration.	You	could	then	specify	height	and	width	in	pixels.      Href	Attribute  For	example:  	  The	 	tag	define	the	Href	Attribute.	As	you	well	may	know	by	now,	this	means	that there	are	HTML	links	around.	You	have	to	specify	the	address	in	the	attribute	itself.   The	World’s	Best	Website    Alt	Attribute  For	example:  	  To	use	alternative	texts,	it’s	best	to	use	the	Alt	Attribute.	This	is	perfect	for	screen	readers, which	makes	it	easy	for	people	viewing	the	website	to	appreciate	the	website	even	better.      Other	Tips	about	Attributes:  Here	are	the	other	important	things	you	have	to	keep	in	mind	when	it	comes	to	attributes:  1.	Double	style	quotes	are	prevalent	in	HTML.	However,	this	does	not	necessarily	mean that	you	could	no	longer	use	single	style	quotes.  2.	Lowercase	letters	are	still	best	used.  3.	To	make	things	easy	for	those	who	are	using	the	website,	make	use	of	the	Alt	Attribute.  4.	Make	sure	to	provide	adequate	information	with	the	help	of	size	attribute.  5.	Keep	links	easy	to	go	to	by	using	href.	Don’t	just	put	the	site	next	to	a	paragraph.  6.	Titles	make	your	pages	easier	to	find	online—make	use	of	them.   Chapter	6:	HTML	Formatting 	  It’s	also	best	that	you	learn	more	about	formatting	and	styles	as	they	help	you	bring	your webpage	to	life.	With	the	right	kind	of	styles	and	formatting,	your	website	gets	to	look different	from	other	sites	around.	Let’s	start	with	formatting	first.   When	it	comes	to	formatting,	you	have	to	understand	that	special	elements	with	special meanings	are	used,	and	are	then	used	to	display	various	types	of	text.	For	example:  Formatting  1.	Small	text  2.	Marked	text  3.	Italic	text  4.	Bold	text  5.	Superscripts  6.	Subscripts  7.	Inserted	Text  8.	Deleted	Text  9.	Important	Text  1.	 	bold	text  So,	basically,	the	following	tags	have	to	be	used:  2.	 	this	means	that	the	text	is	marked	or	in	other	words,	highlighted  3.	 	this	means	that	text	is	or	has	been	deleted  4.	 	this	means	that	text	has	been	inserted  5.	 	superscripted	text  6.	 	subscripted	text  7.	 	this	means	that	the	text	is	important  8.	 	this	defines	text	that	is	smaller	than	what’s	seen	onscreen  9.	 	this	defines	italicized	text  10.	 	this	defines	emphasized	text  To	help	you	understand	these	better,	you	can	take	a	look	at	the	examples	below:   Strong	Text  This	is	used	for	when	you	want	to	indicate	that	something	is	of	utmost	importance—like headings	or	headlines.   look	at	this	normal	text     look	at	this	strong	text .    Bold	Text  Of	 course,	 there	 are	 instances	 when	 you	 have	 to	 format	 some	 of	 the	 words	 you	 see onscreen	in	bold.	It	means	that	the	text	is	important.	For	example,	it	could	be	a	meaning	of a	word,	a	character	in	a	movie,	etc.	Take	a	look	at	the	example	below:   look	at	this	normal	text.     look	at	this	bold	text .   	   Emphasized	Text  This	means	that	you’re	trying	to	make	people	read	an	important	part	of	your	post.	This usually	happens	for	news	articles	or	for	clickbaiting.	For	this,	you	could	try	the	example below:   look	at	this	normal	text.     look	at	this	emphasized	text .   	   Italicized	Text  Just	like	the	subheadings	in	this	book,	sometimes,	you	do	have	to	italicize	words	for	them to	make	more	of	an	impression	on	the	reader.	It’s	all	about	semantics.	Sometimes,	it’s	also used	to	denote	that	other	languages	are	being	used	in	the	paragraph—which	is	usual	for some	novels,	or	works	that	are	in	two	languages.   look	at	this	normal	text.     look	at	this	italicized	text .   	  	   Marked	Formatting  Here’s	a	good	example:  	  Marked	Formatting	means	that	text	has	been	highlighted.	This	is	usually	done	to	spruce	up the	page,	make	it	eye-catching	and	friendly.   HTML	 Marked 	Formatting    Small	Formatting  	  Small	Formatting	is	basically	about	putting	text	with	smaller	fonts	onscreen.	An	example of	this	would	be	as	follows:   HTML	 Small 	Formatting    Inserted	Formatting  This	formatting	means	that	text	has	been	inserted	or	added.	It’s	a	good	way	of	editing	the page,	or	the	website	itself.	Here’s	a	good	example:   My	favorite	 color 	is	red.   	   Deleted	Formatting  This	shows	that	something	has	been	deleted	on	the	page.   My	favorite	color	is	 blue 	red.   	   Superscript	Formatting  This	means	that	a	text	is	in	superscript	form.	For	example:   This	is	 superscripted 	text.   	   Subscript	Formatting  This	means	that	text	is	in	subscript	form.	For	example:   This	is	 subscripted 	text.    Chapter	7:	HTML	Styles 	  Styles	are	known	to	come	in	this	syntax:  Style=	“property:value;”  Of	course,	it’s	also	important	to	think	about	the	style	of	your	page.	Just	like	formatting, this	helps	make	your	page	unique—instead	of	the	same	as	everything	else	online.  Both	are	forms	of	CSS,	where	property	is	the	property	value,	and	value	is	the	CSS	value.  For	Styles,	you	have	to	keep	the	following	in	mind:  1.	Text-align.	This	should	be	used	for	keeping	text	aligned.  2.	Font-size.	This	helps	you	determine	font	sizes.  3.	Font-family.	This	helps	you	determine	text	fonts.  4.	Color.	This	helps	you	define	text	colors.  5.	Background	Color.	This	will	help	you	define	what	the	color	of	the	background	is.  6.	 Style.	 Basically,	 you	 have	 to	 use	 this	 to	 help	 the	 program	 understand	 that	 you’re creating	styles	for	the	page.   Text	Alignment  To	align	text,	you	have	to	think	of	the	horizontal	alignment	system.	For	this,	you	could	try the	example	below:   Centered	Heading   Read	this	paragraph    Text	Size  This	will	help	you	choose	the	right	font	size	for	the	text	you	have	onscreen.	After	all,	it’s just	 imperative	 that	 not	 everything	 should	 be	 the	 same	 font.	 For	 this,	 you	 could	 try	 the example	below:   This	is	a	heading   This	is	a	paragraph.    Fonts  This	is	all	about	choosing	the	kind	of	font	that	you’d	like	the	readers	of	your	website	to see	onscreen.	This	also	defines	font	families,	just	like	what’s	shown	below:   This	is	a	heading   This	is	a	paragraph.    Text	Color  If	you	want	to	change	the	color	of	the	text	onscreen,	of	course,	it’s	best	that	you	know	the right	attribute	to	use,	and	this	is	text	color.	For	this,	you	could	try	this	example:   This	is	a	heading   This	is	a	paragraph.    Background	Color  Whether	you’d	want	the	background	in	white,	black,	pink,	or	any	other	color,	you	have	to use	this	style	type.	Here’s	a	good	example	to	change	background	color	to	salmon	pink:      This	is	a	heading   This	is	a	paragraph.       Chapter	8:	HTML	Quotations  	  There	are	times	when	you	do	have	to	quote	certain	things	on	your	page.	For	example,	if you	have	something	to	attribute	to	another	website,	it’s	best	to	not	twist	their	words	so	that your	readers	would	get	a	really	valuable	read,	and	know	that	you	know	how	to	link	to	the right	sources.  For	this,	you	have	to	remember	the	following:  1.	 .	This	means	that	there’s	a	short,	inline	quotation.  2.	 .	This	is	attributed	to	the	title	of	a	topic	on	the	page.  3.	 .	This	means	that	you	have	quoted	something	from	outside	sources.  4.	 .	This	states	for	text	dictation.  5.	 .	This	is	the	contact	information	quote.  6.	 .	acronym	or	abbreviation   Long	Quote  For	example,	you	have	created	a	new	website	for	fostering	and	taking	care	of	animals,	and you	are	affiliated	to	the	WWF	 World	Wildlife	Fund .	This	means	you	may	have	to	quote from	their	website.	How	would	you	do	this?  Well,	you	can	use	the	Long	Quote	Style.	This	is	depicted	by	 ,	which	would then	indent	the	passage.	So,	if	you	have	quoted	this	way:   Here	is	a	quote	from	WWF’s	website:    For	50	years,	WWF	has	been	protecting	the	future	of	nature. The	world’s	leading	conservation	organization, WWF	works	in	100	countries	and	is	supported	by 1.2	million	members	in	the	United	States	and close	to	5	million	globally.    What	you’ll	see	onscreen	is	something	like	this:  Here	is	a	quote	from	WWF’s	website:  For	 50	 years,	 WWF	 has	 been	 protecting	 the	 future	 of	 nature.	 The	 world’s leading	 conservation	 organization,	 WWF	 works	 in	 100	 countries	 and	 is supported	by	1.2	million	members	in	the	United	States	and	close	to	5	million globally.   Short	Quote  For	short	quotes,	you	could	try	using	 .	For	example:   ABC123’s	 Goal	 is	 to:	  Build	 a	 future	 where	 people	 know	 how	 to	 code without	problems,	and	create	the	websites	they	want.     Contact	Information	Quote  If	you’re	observant,	you’d	know	that	a	lot	of	websites	make	use	of	the	Contact	tab	where you	get	to	see	contact	information	of	the	owner	of	the	website.	For	this,	you	could	use	the HTML	 	code.	This	is	usually	seen	in	italic	with	line	breaks.  For	example:    Written	by	Blair	Waldorf	 	 Visit	us	at:  blaircornelia.com  New	York,	New	York  USA     Abbreviations  Abbreviations	also	fall	under	quotations.	For	this,	you	have	to	use	the	 	tag.	This way,	 it	 would	 be	 easy	 to	 get	 information	 from	 search	 engines,	 translation	 systems,	 and other	browsers.	For	this,	you	could	try	the	example	below:   The	 WWW 	was	founded	in	1989.    Chapter	9:	HTML	CSS 	  And	finally,	it’s	also	good	to	learn	a	thing	or	two	about	CSS	 Cascading	Style	Sheets . These	could	spruce	up	your	page,	making	it	aesthetically	good,	and	helping	make	sure	that navigation	is	also	easy.	It	also	allows	you	to	add	more	features	to	the	website.	There	are	3 important	CSS	elements	and	they	are:  1.	Internal.	This	means	that	you’re	using	an	element	of	 	and	you	could	find	this	in the	HTML	 	section.  2.	Inline.	This	depicts	HTML	style	attributes.  3.	External.	This	means	that	you’re	using	external	CSS	Files.   Important	Elements  1.	Style.	Internal	Styling  2.	CSS	Margin.	Space	outside	the	border  3.	CSS	Padding.	Space	inside	the	border  4.	CSS	Font-Size.	This	determines	text	sizes  5.	CSS	Font-Family.	This	determines	where	the	font	came	from  6.	CSS	Color.	This	determines	the	color	of	font	being	used  7.	 .	This	refers	to	elements	of	 	and	   8.	 .	A	link	to	external	CSS	files  9.	 .	The	style	of	internal	CSS   Internal	Styling	 Internal	CSS   This	means	that	you’re	trying	to	define	the	style	of	a	single	page	in	your	website.	You	can see	this	in	the	 	of	your	page.	It	encapsulates	the	element	of	 .  For	example:          body	{background-color:white;} h1			{color:pink;} p				{color:violet;}         Read	this	heading   Read	this	paragraph	         Inline	Styling	 or	Inline	CSS   Inline	CSS	means	that	you	have	to	apply	unique	styles	to	single	elements	in	your	page. This	also	falls	under	the	HTML	Style	Attribute.	For	example,	if	you	want	to	change	the color	of	 	heading	to	pink,	you	could	try:   This	is	a	Pink	Heading    External	Styling	 External	CSS   External	CSS	is	mostly	about	defining	style	for	a	couple	of	pages	in	your	website—not just	one	page	alone.	With	the	help	of	just	one	file,	you	could	already	change	the	entire look	of	your	website—which	really	makes	things	easy	for	you.  Then,	you	could	just	add	a	link	to	the	External	CSS	sheet	in	the	 	part	of	your	page. For	this,	you	could	try	the	example	below:        		        Read	this	heading	   Read	this	paragraph.         CSS	Fonts  Finally,	 in	 order	 to	 easily	 change	 fonts,	 make	 sure	 that	 you	 know	 how	 to	 differentiate elements.	Color	determines	the	HTML	text	color	in	the	page,	font-size	is	all	about	the	size of	 font	 used,	 and	 font-family	 defines	 which	 family	 the	 font	 came	 from	  i.e.,	 serif,	 sans serif,	etc.           h1	{ 				color:	blue; 				font-family:	serif; 				font-size:	100%; } p		{ 				color:	red; 				font-family:	courier; 				font-size:	120%; }         Read	this	heading   Read	this	paragraph.

Thanks	again	for	downloading	this	book,	I	hope	you	enjoy	it!     Chapter	1:	What	is	SEO	and	Why	is	it	Important	to	your Website? 	  The	internet	is	an	ocean	of	information.	It	is	a	network	of	interconnected	computers	from  all	around	the	world.	It	allows	us	to	access	information	from	computers	halfway	around  the	world.	  By	itself	however,	the	internet	is	a	big	mess.	It	is	full	of	webpages	that	cater	to	the	needs  to	 billions	 of	 individuals.	 Early	 on,	 engineers	 have	 been	 looking	 for	 a	 tool	 that	 can  organize	all	the	information	in	the	web	and	help	people	find	what	they	are	looking	for	in  the	least	amount	of	time.  The	search	engine	is	that	tool.  This	is	the	function	of	the	search	engine.	They	“crawl”	through	as	many	webpages	as	they  can	 by	 making	 artificial	 intelligence	 visit	 webpages	 and	 collect	 information.	 They	 add  information	about	the	crawled	pages	in	an	index.	When	a	person	types	a	search	query,	the  search	engine	runs	through	all	the	crawled	pages	and	brings	back	a	list	of	pages	that	fits  the	query.	It	then	organizes	these	pages	according	to	their	relevance	to	the	query	of	the  user.  Billions	of	people	use	search	engines	monthly.	Some	of	them	may	be	interested	in	your  website.	In	order	to	drive	traffic	into	your	website,	you	want	your	webpages	to	rank	high  in	the	search	results	of	your	target	visitor.  What	are	search	queries?  Search	queries	are	questions	from	search	engine	users.	They	are	using	the	search	engine	to  look	for	answers.	Here	are	the	three	types	of	questions	that	people	as	search	engines:  Where 	how	can	I	find	[name	of	thing?   Some	people	use	queries	to	look	for	specific	real	world	things	or	locations.	A	person	may  be	looking	for	a	second-hand	car	around	New	York.	He	asks	the	search	engine	to	look	for  all	the	posted	classified	ads	about	second-hand	cars	by	typing:  “Second-hand	cars	in	New	York	City	classified	ads”  He	finds	that	there	are	too	many	results	so	he	narrows	down	his	search	to:  “Second-hand	Lexus	in	Manhattan	craigslist”  What,	When	and	Where	Questions  Most	of	the	time	however,	people	use	search	engines	to	look	for	information.	Some	people  for	example,	use	search	engines	to	look	for	answers	for	their	schoolwork.	Many	people  also	go	to	search	engines	to	look	for	news	about	current	events	relevant	to	them.	Instead	of  looking	for	a	phonebook,	people	also	find	it	faster	to	find	the	address	and	contact	number  of	a	business	through	the	internet.  What	is	the	website	of	[company	name]?  Lastly,	 people	 use	 search	 engines	 to	 go	 to	 specific	 areas	 on	 the	 web.	 Some	 people	 for  example,	want	to	go	to	the	website	of	their	local	newspaper.	They	do	not	know	the	exact  website	address	so	they	ask	google	to	lead	them	there.  The	 search	 engine	 has	 become	 the	 primary	 source	 of	 answers	 for	 most	 people	 in  developed	countries.	The	majority	of	users	of	search	engines	like	Google	trust	the	search  results	compiled	by	the	algorithm.	Most	people	expect	to	find	the	answer	to	their	query	in  top	result.	If	the	first	five	results	do	not	seem	to	have	the	answer	to	their	question,	people  tend	to	think	that	there	must	be	something	wrong	with	the	phrase	they	used	in	the	query.  Most	people	refine	their	search	just	like	the	guy	looking	for	a	second-hand	Lexus	in	New  York.	  How	does	this	affect	your	website?   If	you	want	to	get	more	traffic	into	your	website,	you	need	to	know	how	search	engines  work	and	you	need	to	be	able	to	optimize	your	webpages	so	that	they	will	be	crawled,  indexed	and	shown	in	the	top	of	the	search	results	page.  Showing	up	in	search	is	not	good	enough	when	it	comes	to	SEO.	The	top	result	is	clicked  on	more	than	18%	of	the	time.	The	number	of	clicks	your	pages	get	lowers	as	your	pages  shows	up	lower	on	the	search	engine	results	page.  In	the	advent	of	smartphones,	people	thought	at	first	that	the	popularity	of	websites	would  begin	to	decrease.	The	average	person	thought	that	apps	would	replace	search.	If	this	will  indeed	happen,	it	has	not	showed	up	so	far.	Though	the	number	of	hours	spent	in	front	of  desktop	computers	has	decreased,	people	are	still	using	search	to	find	the	information	that  they	need	and	the	items	that	they	want.	People	with	websites	optimized	for	mobile	phone  screens	will	get	the	bulk	of	the	traffic	from	mobile	search.  Activity	for	Days	1	and	2:	Decide	on	your	website’s	topic	or	niche  It	 is	 easier	 for	 your	 website	 to	 rank	 if	 your	 website	 is	 focused	 on	 one	 subject.	 If	 you  already	have	a	general	information	website	or	blog,	you	can	decide	on	the	best	topic	to  pursue	based	on	the	popular	posts	or	content	you	already	have.  When	 thinking	 of	 a	 topic	 or	 niche	 for	 your	 website,	 you	 should	 also	 consider	 your  personal	goal	for	building	it.	The	type	of	content	that	you	create	henceforth	should	take  you	a	step	closer	to	reaching	your	goal.     Chapter	2:	Limitations	of	the	search	technology 	  The	 search	 engine	 is	 the	 most	 popular	 tool	 for	 looking	 for	 information	 on	 the	 web.  However,	 even	 with	 all	 the	 improvements	 in	 search	 algorithm	 and	 page	 crawling  technology,	this	tool	still	has	plenty	of	limitations.	For	instance,	a	search	engine	cannot  directly	tell	on	its	own	if	a	webpage	is	relevant	to	users	after	crawling	and	indexing	it.	It  needs	to	look	for	more	clues	in	order	to	know	if	a	certain	page	should	be	on	the	top	of	the  search	results	for	certain	keywords.  Your	job	as	a	webmaster	and	search	marketer	is	to	provide	search	engines	with	the	clues  they	will	need	to	put	you	on	the	top	result.	Search	engine	experts	refer	to	these	clues	as  ranking	 factors.	 Ranking	 factors	 are	 the	 information	 that	 search	 engine	 spiders	 look	 for  when	they	arrive	at	your	website.	They	compile	these	ranking	factors	during	indexing.	A  webpage’s	 position	 in	 the	 search	 results	 for	 keywords	 will	 depend	 on	 how	 well	 their  ranking	scores	are,	based	on	these	factors.  Even	 when	 considering	 hundreds	 of	 ranking	 factors,	 search	 engines	 still	 have	 many  limitations.  What	are	the	limitations	of	search	engines?   							Crawler	bots	rely	on	links	to	get	around  The	 search	 engine	 crawlers’	 purpose	 is	 to	 make	 a	 virtual	 map	 of	 the	 entire	 searchable  internet,	and	by	that,	we	mean	the	parts	of	the	internet	that	regular	people	can	access.	To  jump	from	one	page	to	another,	they	use	hyperlinks	in	the	pages	that	they	crawl.	These  digital	bridges	are	an	important	ranking	factor.  If	there	are	some	pages	in	your	website	that	does	not	have	a	link	leading	to	it,	you	should  expect	that	it	will	not	be	indexed	and	not	show	up	in	search	result	pages.	    							They	cannot	crawl	to	pages	protected	by	online	forms  It	is	common	for	websites	to	ask	their	visitors	to	become	members.	To	become	one,	you  need	to	fill	up	a	membership	form.	Search	engines	are	not	equipped	with	the	programing  to	 fill	 up	 all	 types	 of	 forms.	 Because	 of	 this,	 they	 cannot	 crawl	 any	 information	 that  webmasters	exclusively	show	to	members.   							They	are	specialized	for	text-content  Search	 engine	 crawlers	 specialize	 in	 gathering	 information	 from	 text-based	 websites.  Their	ability	to	collect	and	organize	information	from	non-text	content	is	severely	limited.  A	crawler	bot	for	example	will	not	be	able	to	tell	on	its	own,	how	a	picture	looks.	They  also	face	similar	challenges	with	video,	audio,	image,	flash	and	plug-in	contents.  To	work	around	this,	search	companies	ask	webmasters	to	include	text	information	with  these	contents.	Without	this	additional	information,	certain	types	of	content	in	a	webpage  will	not	be	given	much	weight	when	ranking	it.   							They	require	keywords	to	match  When	a	user	uses	the	search	engine,	they	generally	type	in	a	phrase	that	describes	what  they	are	looking	for.	The	search	engine	algorithm	has	evolved	and	they	are	more	capable  than	 ever	 to	 provide	 you	 with	 relevant	 webpages	 90%	 of	 the	 time.	 Users	 may	 run	 into  some	 issues	 however	 if	 they	 are	 not	 using	 the	 right	 terms.	 Millions	 of	 users	 use  uncommon	terms	when	searching	for	something	unfamiliar.  This	limitation	is	common	among	people	who	are	new	to	the	English	language.	When	they  do	 not	 know	 the	 word	 for	 something,	 they	 may	 use	 adjectives	 to	 describe	 it.	 A	 native  English	speaker	will	know	what	he	may	be	trying	to	say	but	search	engines	do	not	have  the	programming	to	understand	what	a	non-native	speaker	may	be	asking	for.  This	issue	also	becomes	difficult	to	work	with	when	we	are	using	language	subtleties	that   are	 unfamiliar	 for	 the	 search	 AI.	 The	 difference	 in	 spelling	 of	 the	 same	 words	 among  different	English	speaking	countries	for	example	will	affect	your	search	result	ranking.	If  you	use	“behaviour”	in	place	of	“behavior”	consistently	for	example,	the	search	engine  may	think	that	your	webpage	is	designed	for	British	users.	This	will	affect	your	ranking  among	American	users.  Success	in	search	marketing	will	greatly	depend	on	your	knowledge	of	the	language	that  you	are	working	with.	If	you	are	targeting	a	specific	minority	group	as	prospect	visitors  for	 your	 website	 for	 example,	 you	 should	 know	 the	 subtle	 differences	 in	 their	 use	 of  language.	It	also	helps	of	you	have	knowledge	of	their	searching	behavior.   							Proper	names	vs	general	names  Because	 of	 the	 dependence	 on	 keywords,	 search	 engines	 also	 have	 the	 challenge	 of  reading	 words	 in	 the	 right	 context.	 This	 challenge	 becomes	 more	 difficult	 as	 users	 use  keywords	that	have	multiple	meanings.	For	example,	popular	culture	has	been	using	the  word	 “black”	 quite	 extensively.	 There	 are	 songs,	 movies,	 and	 brands	 that	 contain	 that  word.	People	who	type	them	in	search	may	also	be	referring	to	the	color	of	an	item	they  are	looking	for.	Because	of	this,	search	engine	users	tend	to	make	longer	phrases	when  they	 search	 to	 make	 the	 results	 more	 specific	 to	 their	 needs.	 Because	 of	 this	 search  behavior,	webmasters	started	targeting	long-tail	keywords.	These	are	phrases	that	people  usually	use	when	searching.	They	are	more	than	three	words	long	and	they	refer	to	very  specific	needs	of	the	searcher.  The	search	technology	is	constantly	changing.	Engineers	are	continuing	to	develop	new  forms	of	technology	so	the	A.I.	can	work	around	these	limitations.	It	is	because	of	these  limitations	that	we	need	to	optimize	our	webpages	for	both	users	and	the	search	engines.  Activity	for	Days	3	and	4:  You	 should	 take	 the	 time	 to	 review	 the	 limitations	 of	 search	 engines	 discussed	 in	 this   chapter	and	think	of	the	difficulties	of	your	prospective	visitors	in	reaching	your	website  through	the	search	engines.  You	should	also	take	the	time	to	check	your	website’s	visibility	in	search	engine	results  page.	 Use	 generic	 keywords	 and	 phrases	 for	 your	 industry	 or	 niche.	 If	 you	 cannot	 find  your	website	in	the	first	three	pages,	you	need	to	do	a	lot	of	work.	If	you	are	in	the	top  three	 pages	 but	 you	 are	 not	 in	 the	 first	 page,	 your	 goal	 is	 to	 climb	 up	 the	 ladder.  Regardless	of	your	position,	you	should	use	the	strategies	and	information	in	this	book	to  improve	your	website’s	ranking.     Chapter	3:	Your	Target	Users:	The	Beginning	of	your	Search Marketing	Strategy 	  When	 developing	 a	 search	 marketing	 strategy	 for	 a	 website,	 you	 need	 to	 start	 thinking  about	the	group	of	people	who	may	find	value	in	the	information	found	in	your	website.  They	are	the	types	of	people	who	are	most	likely	to	click	on	your	webpage	when	they	see  it	in	the	search	result	page.	Search	engines	bridge	the	gap	between	your	website	content  and	people	who	need	them.  Profiling	your	target	search	engine	users  Internet	users	make	billions	of	searches	every	month.	Not	all	of	these	searches	however,  are	valuable	to	your	website.	The	number	of	people	looking	for	the	types	of	information	in  your	website	depends	on	the	popularity	of	the	industry	or	niche	of	you	website.	The	more  popular	the	niche,	the	more	searchers	it	will	have.	Popular	niches	however,	also	have	a	lot  of	competition.  To	get	ahead	of	your	competition,	you	need	to	get	to	know	your	ideal	visitors.	You	can	do  this	by	creating	a	profile	of	the	ideal	visitor	for	your	website.	If	you	already	have	website  that	has	been	running	for	a	while,	you	may	be	able	to	gather	some	information	about	the  types	of	people	who	are	visiting	your	website	through	the	analytics	software	that	you	use.  Here	are	some	types	of	the	information	about	your	visitors	that	you	will	need:   							Age   							Gender   							Language   							Location   							Common	interest   By	obtaining	these	types	of	information,	you	will	be	able	to	guess	the	words	that	people  are	 most	 likely	 to	 use	 when	 using	 search	 engines.	 You	 may	 also	 need	 some	 additional  information	depending	on	the	type	of	website	that	you	have.  Your	goals	for	your	visitors  After	creating	a	profile	of	your	ideal	visitors,	you	need	to	decide	on	what	you	want	these  people	 to	 do	 when	 they	 arrive	 at	 your	 website.	 If	 you	 are	 selling	 something	 on	 your  website,	you	may	need	to	tweak	the	design	to	make	sure	that	the	users	can	start	making	a  purchase	from	your	indexed	pages.  Other	 websites	 want	 their	 visitors	 to	 fill	 up	 forms,	 answer	 surveys,	 or	 sign	 up	 for  membership.  Having	a	goal	also	allows	you	to	refine	the	types	of	keywords	that	you	are	targeting.	If  you	are	selling	something	for	example,	you	may	need	to	target	purchase-related	phrases.  Some	 marketers	 only	 target	 phrases	 used	 by	 people	 who	 are	 in	 the	 late	 stages	 of	 the  purchasing	process.  Activity	for	Days	5	and	6:	Identify	your	Target	Users  The	next	 activity	is	 to	identify	 the	 characteristics	of	 the	ideal	 visitors	for	 your	 website.  Ideal	visitors	refer	to	the	people	who	are	most	likely	to	do	what	you	want	accomplished.  You	should	state	what	these	people	have	in	common.	Aside	from	the	information	stated	in  chapter	3,	you	should	also	research	on	other	websites	that	also	cater	to	the	needs	of	the  same	target	market.	You	should	check	out	their	designs	and	the	types	of	content	that	they  offer.     Chapter	4:	Choosing	Keywords	to	Rank 	  Now	that	you	know	who	your	target	visitors	are,	you	need	to	choose	the	right	keywords  that	they	will	use	when	they	search	for	information	that	you	are	offering.  To	know	the	keywords	that	your	target	users	are	using,	you	need	to	put	yourself	in	your  target	users’	shoes.	You	need	to	use	the	information	that	you	have	in	the	profile	that	you  have	created	to	guess	the	right	types	of	language	that	you	should	use.  You	also	need	to	remind	yourself	of	the	limitations	that	the	search	engine	technology	have.  You	 need	 to	 make	 sure	 that	 your	 keywords	 represent	 the	 types	 of	 content	 that	 you	 are  showing	in	your	page	as	well	as	the	intent	of	your	prospect	visitors.	Your	ultimate	goals	it  to	provide	what	the	prospect	visitors	need	and	then	convert	them	into	buyers,	subscribers,  members	or,	at	the	very	least,	return	visitors.  Most	beginner	webmasters	think	that	they	should	choose	just	one	strong	keyword	and	use  that	in	all	the	pages	of	their	website.	To	search	engines,	this	strategy	will	look	a	lot	like  keyword	stuffing.  If	you	want	to	make	your	website	as	the	primary	source	of	information	for	your	topic,	you  need	to	aim	to	rank	well	on	multiple	keywords	that	are	related	to	your	website’s	topic.	If  your	 website	 is	 about	 a	 TV	 show	 for	 example,	 you	 may	 want	 to	 target	 its	 title	 in	 your  website’s	home	page.	You	should	then	create	posts	or	pages	related	to	the	show	like	a	page  about	the	character.	In	this	page,	you	may	use	this	example	“[TV	show	title]	characters”	as  your	main	keyword.  There	are	free	and	paid	tools	that	will	help	you	find	the	most	used	keywords	for	certain  topics.	One	of	the	most	popular	among	them	is	Google	Adwords	Keyword	Planner.  When	planning	your	keywords,	you	should	also	consider	the	following	factors:    							The	name	of	the	products	or	services	that	you	are	offering  This	 includes	 the	 generic	 name	 of	 the	 service	 and	 the	 brand.	 Some	 people	 who	 are  thinking	of	purchasing	something	usually	know	the	brand	that	they	want	to	purchase	so  you	should	have	website	content	that	directly	addresses	the	questions	about	these	brands.  These	types	of	content	will	help	your	website	be	found	through	search.   							Related	topics	regarding	your	products	or	services  You	 should	 also	 provide	 content	 for	 topics	 related	 to	 your	 product	 or	 service.	 Many  company	 websites	 for	 instance,	 include	 company	 updates.	 This	 shows	 activity	 in	 your  website.	One	of	the	most	important	ranking	factor	is	frequency	of	updates.   							Seasonal	popular	keywords  You	 should	 also	 prepare	 search-marketing	 campaigns	 for	 seasons	 when	 high	 volume	 of  sales	and	traffic	is	to	be	expected.	For	retail	websites	for	example,	Christmas,	Valentines  and	 Thanksgiving	 seasons	 are	 big	 events.	 In	 this	 season,	 people	 tend	 to	 look	 for	 ideas  online	for	offline	purchases.	You	should	take	advantage	of	people’s	habit	to	splurge	during  these	seasons.  Using	Keywords	when	constructing	your	webpages  Every	 time	 you	 create	 a	 blog	 post	 or	 a	 new	 webpage,	 you	 need	 to	 consider	 the	 target  keywords	that	you	will	use.	You	should	target	one	main	keyword	for	each	page	or	post  you	create.	Your	keywords	should	be	in	line	with	the	activity	that	you	want	your	visitors  to	 perform.	 If	 you	 want	 your	 visitors	 to	 purchase	 something,	 your	 goal	 is	 to	 build	 a  webpage	targeting	keywords	used	by	searchers	with	an	intent	to	buy.	You	could	also	make  webpages	with	keywords	used	my	searchers	who	are	researching	about	specific	products.  When	you	know	the	keywords	to	rank	for,	your	next	goal	is	to	put	them	strategically	in  your	webpage.	When	placing	your	keywords	in	these	locations,	you	must	make	sure	that   they	appear	naturally.	Your	primary	goal	is	for	your	content	to	be	understood	by	human  visitors.	User	experience	is	always	more	important	than	any	SEO	strategy.	With	that	in  mind,	you	should	place	your	keyword	in	the	following	parts	of	your	website:   							URL	extension  It	helps	if	your	domain	name	already	contains	the	keyword	that	you	want	to	rank	for.	Most  of	the	time	however,	you	will	need	to	insert	the	keywords	at	the	later	parts	of	the	URL	to  make	sure	that	it	is	included	in	the	URL	bar.   							Title	Tag  The	title	tag	gives	the	crawlers	an	idea	of	what	your	page	is	about.	Generally,	you	need	to  add	your	keywords	as	early	as	possible	in	the	title	tag.	The	challenge	with	this	strategy	is  when	you	have	a	creative	title	planned.	Sometimes,	putting	the	keywords	in	the	early	part  of	the	title	tag	makes	it	sound	awkward.	You	should	prioritize	user	experience	if	this	is	the  case.   							Near	the	top	of	the	page  You	 should	 also	 include	 the	 keywords	 in	 the	 first	 paragraph	 of	 your	 content.	 Lengthy  types	of	contents	are	not	entirely	scanned	by	crawlers.	Aside	from	the	title	tag,	crawlers  also	try	to	figure	out	what	your	content	is	about	from	the	first	paragraphs.	This	is	why	you  need	to	include	your	keywords	in	these	areas.   							Text	content	of	the	page  Aside	 from	 the	 first	 paragraph,	 you	 should	 also	 add	 the	 keywords	 3-4	 times	 in	 various  parts	of	the	content.	In	this	case,	you	may	need	to	make	variations	of	the	main	keywords  to	make	it	sound	natural	and	to	avoid	redundancy	for	the	readers.   							Alt-attribute	of	images  You	should	also	add	sentences	or	descriptions	of	your	pictures	in	the	image’s	alt-attribute.   This	will	help	your	images	rank	well	in	the	image	search	feature	of	search	engines.	You  should	make	sure	that	you	only	include	images	related	to	your	content.	You	should	also	try  to	make	unique	images	and	photos.	This	will	make	your	images	stand	out	in	the	image  search	result	pages	and	may	lead	to	higher	click	through	rates.  Meta	description  ranking	factor.  All	the	other	attributes	above	will	make	webpages	rank	better	in	the	search	engine	result  pages.	To	keep	your	webpages	ranking	high,	you	need	to	make	sure	that	people	who	see	it  click	on	it	to	go	to	your	page.	A	webpage’s	past	click-through	rates	is	also	an	important  Two	important	factors	will	improve	your	click-through	rate	in	the	search	engine.	The	first  one	is	the	title	of	your	content,	which	was	discussed	earlier	in	this	section.	The	second	one  is	the	description	under	the	title.	Most	content	management	software	 CMS 	will	use	the  first	 part	 of	 the	 text	 content	 as	 the	 description	 by	 default.	 You	 should	 check	 with	 your  CMS	on	how	to	add	a	meta	description	so	that	you	can	control	the	text	that	appears	below  your	title	in	the	search	engine	result	pages.	You	need	to	experiment	on	different	copies	of  your	description	to	be	able	to	arrive	at	the	ones	the	yield	the	highest	click-through	rates.  Activity	for	Days	7	and	8:	Do	Keyword	Research  When	you	already	have	a	website	and	a	specific	topic	to	pursue,	your	next	move	is	to	find  keywords	and	phrases	that	will	help	you	reach	your	goals	for	your	website.	Refer	to	the  tips	in	this	chapter	to	understand	how	keywords	work	in	SEO	and	how	to	use	them.	Aside  from	the	ever-popular	Google	AdWords	Keyword	Planner,	there	are	other	free	online	tools  that	you	can	use	when	researching	for	the	best	keywords	for	your	website:  Microsoft	Bing	Ads  This	is	Bing’s	version	of	the	keyword	planner.	If	a	large	part	of	your	website	traffic	comes  from	Bing,	you	should	also	use	this	tool.   Google	Trends  over	the	years.  Google	trends	provide	you	with	the	popular	keywords	used	by	people	around	the	world.  They	also	allow	you	to	check	what	is	popular	in	your	country	right	now	and	in	the	past.  You	can	also	get	insights	on	the	fluctuation	of	popularity	of	certain	keywords	and	phrases     Chapter	5:	User	Experience	Affects	your	Ranking 	  In	the	last	chapter,	we	discussed	the	importance	of	keeping	your	targeted	keywords	in	line  with	what	your	webpages	are	about	and	what	your	visitors	need.  If	your	website	for	example	focuses	on	muscle-building	workout	equipment,	you	should  target	keywords	that	people	use	to	look	for	that	type	of	item	online.  When	people	click	on	the	link	to	your	webpage	on	the	search	engine	results	page,	they  have	expectations	that	you	need	to	meet.	In	this	particular	example,	if	you	rank	in	the	right  keywords,	the	visitor	may	expect	to	find	different	types	of	weighted	exercise	tools.	You  may	also	add	food	supplements	that	increase	the	rate	of	muscle	growth.  Let	us	say	that	your	visitor	arrives	to	your	website	using	the	key	phrase	“muscle-building  workout	equipment”	but	when	they	got	to	your	website,	they	found	that	you	focus	on	yoga  tips	and	you	only	review	yoga-related	products.	In	this	case,	your	visitor	will	be	slightly  disappointed	with	the	results	and	may	click	the	“back”	button	in	their	mobile	device	or  their	browser.  This	is	an	example	of	a	bad	user	experience.	Search	engines	try	to	avoid	sending	people	to  the	wrong	websites.	They	also	try	to	prevent	poorly	structured	websites	from	ranking	well.  To	 make	 sure	 that	 only	 the	 best	 websites	 for	 a	 particular	 topic	 gets	 the	 top	 spot	 in	 the  search	result	pages,	the	search	engine	algorithm	considers	multiple	ranking	factors.	Check  your	website	for	the	following	ranking	factors	for	a	generally	great	user	experience:   							Keyword-topic	alignment  The	 first	 factor	 to	 consider	 is	 the	 keywords	 that	 you	 use.	 When	 your	 topic	 and	 your  dominant	keywords	are	not	in	line,	your	webpage	may	rank	on	keywords	not	related	to	the  content	you	offer.	This	will	lead	to	unsatisfied	users.	You	may	even	get	penalties	in	future   algorithm	updates.   																				Inbound	link	quality  Links	are	a	signal	to	the	search	engines	that	the	webpage’s	content	is	popular.	This	gives  them	the	idea	that	people	who	may	be	interested	in	it	in	the	future	will	have	a	good	user  experience	when	engaging	with	the	content.  	  Popular	 websites	 have	 a	 considerable	 advantage	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 building	 links.	 More  people	are	already	following	their	content	and	they	are	more	likely	to	get	links	from	other  great	quality	websites	right	after	they	publish.   																				Navigational	structure  Your	website’s	navigation	is	also	important.	Generally,	you	should	make	sure	that	visitors  could	 reach	 all	 the	 pages	 from	 your	 home	 page	 in	 three	 clicks	 or	 less.	 If	 you	 have	 not  planned	on	your	website’s	navigation	on	your	building	stage,	you	should	take	the	time	to  list	down	all	your	webpages	and	make	sure	that	they	are	easily	accessible	from	your	home  page.   																				User	Engagement  When	people	click	on	the	back	button	right	after	clicking	on	your	link	in	the	search	engine  results	 page,	 the	 search	 engine	 thinks	 that	 the	 user	 was	 disappointed	 with	 what	 they  experienced.	This	could	happen	for	a	variety	of	reasons.	For	instance,	it	could	be	because  a	particular	webpage	is	too	slow	in	loading	content.	It	could	also	be	because	they	saw	that  the	content	in	the	webpage	was	not	what	they	need.	However,	people	can	click	back	for  less	important	reasons.	Regardless	of	people’s	reasons	for	clicking	the	back	button,	it	will  affect	your	page’s	ranking	in	the	search	engines.  To	prevent	this	from	happening,	you	should	design	your	content	to	keep	people	engaged.   If	you	 are	using	 dominantly	text	 content,	 writer	your	 first	paragraph	 well	to	 get	 people  hooked	and	not	want	to	click	back.	You	should	also	provide	photos	and	images	so	that  they	will	not	just	see	a	wall	of	text.	If	you	have	a	video	on	the	page,	you	need	to	make	sure  that	 it	 is	 functioning	 well	 and	 it	 loads	 fast.	 Lastly,	 you	 should	 have	 links	 to	 other  interesting	content	to	make	sure	that	your	visitor	does	not	“bounce”	or	leave	your	website  after	the	first	page.   							Machine	insights  One	of	the	most	significant	updates	in	the	world	of	SEO	is	the	Panda	updates	of	2011.  Google	introduced	a	new	part	in	its	ranking	algorithm,	referred	to	in	the	SEO	industry	as  machine	learning.	In	a	nutshell,	the	algorithm	mimics	how	humans	judge	website	quality.  Many	seasoned	websites	were	overtaken	by	upstart	websites	when	the	updates	rolled	out  because	the	design	and	overall	user	experience	of	the	newer	websites	were	better	than	the  older	ones.	The	black	hat	SEO	practitioners	were	the	target	of	the	updates	however;	good  quality	websites	with	a	few	black	hat	practices	were	also	affected.  Google’s	goal	was	to	clean	up	its	search	results	from	badly	built	websites	that	provide	less  than	satisfactory	user	experience.	As	long	as	you	keep	your	content	quality	high	and	you  make	sure	that	your	users	are	satisfied	with	what	you	offer,	you	will	be	safe.	By	following  the	tips	in	this	book,	you	will	be	able	to	avoid	some	of	the	negative	effects	of	past	updates  and	possibly,	some	future	updates.  	  visitors  Activity	for	Days	9	–	10:	Design	your	website	according	to	the	preference	of	your	ideal  You	should	make	sure	that	your	website	looks	great	to	your	ideal	visitors.	All	the	content  that	you	have	should	also	fit	their	needs	and	wants.	Lastly,	you	should	test	your	website’s  navigation.	You	need	to	make	sure	that	you	connect	pages	with	related	content	through   links.	If	you	have	someone	to	help	you	out,	you	should	have	him	or	her	look	for	a	specific  information	 in	 your	 website.	 You	 should	 then	 ask	 them	 for	 feedback	 on	 your	 website’s  navigation.     Chapter	6:	Building	your	Webpages ’ Link	Profile 	  Search	engines	consider	links	as	popularity	metrics.	After	the	Panda	updates,	Google	still  considers	links	as	valuable,	but	it	has	become	stricter	in	using	them	as	ranking	factors.	  How	search	engines	use	links:  Make	sure	your	links	relate	to	your	main	topic  The	types	of	links	leading	to	your	website	should	depend	on	the	type	of	content	that	you  offer.	If	you	offer	celebrity	news	for	example,	the	websites	publishing	your	links	should  also	 be	 related	 to	 celebrities.	 This	 includes	 celebrity	 blogs,	 forums	 and	 other	 celebrity  news	sites.  You	 should	 also	 consider	 the	 locality	 of	 your	 website.	 If	 your	 website	 caters	 to	 the  population	of	a	specific	city,	links	from	websites	also	related	to	that	city	will	have	more  weight	than	links	from	websites	that	offer	general	information.  Popular	websites	hold	more	weight  You	should	also	consider	a	website’s	popularity	when	looking	for	sources	of	links.	A	link  from	the	New	York	Times	website	will	hold	more	weight	than	a	link	from	your	friend’s  blog.	 Search	 engines	 consider	 these	 types	 of	 website	 as	 trustworthy.	 Links	 from	 spam  websites	will	also	do	your	webpages	more	harm	than	good.  Be	careful	in	using	anchor	texts  In	the	link	structure,	the	most	important	factor	to	consider	is	the	anchor	text.	This	is	the  part	of	the	code	of	the	link	that	users	can	read	and	click.	The	anchor	texts	of	links	leading  to	your	website	should	also	be	related	to	your	topic.	However,	you	should	make	sure	that  the	anchor	texts	leading	to	your	webpages	look	natural.	If	all	of	them	use	the	same	anchor  texts,	 Google	 may	 think	 that	 you	 are	 gaming	 the	 system	 or	 using	 black	 hat	 methods	 to   build	links.  Build	links	slowly	over	time  website	indiscriminately.  A	link’s	value	decreases	over	time  Search	engines	may	also	think	that	you	are	using	such	methods	if	your	website	is	new	but  you	already	have	hundreds	of	links.	To	avoid	this	from	happening,	you	should	make	sure  that	the	SEO	companies	or	professionals	you	hire	will	not	build	links	that	point	to	your  Amateur	marketers	also	think	that	the	quality	of	the	links	they	have	remain	the	same	as  long	as	it	is	live.	Google	however,	has	taken	freshness	of	content	as	an	important	factor  when	 ranking.	 As	 the	 websites	 that	 link	 to	 you	 become	 less	 popular,	 your	 ranking	 also  goes	 down.	 To	 prevent	 this	 from	 happening,	 you	 should	 produce	 content	 regularly	 that  will	contribute	to	your	link	profile.  Activity	for	days	11	-13:  You	will	need	a	lot	of	time	in	building	your	website’s	link	profile	but	taking	these	steps  will	 help	 you	 in	 starting	 the	 process.	 Your	 first	 task	 is	 to	 find	 people	 who	 also	 have  websites	similar	to	yours.	They	should	not	offer	spam	content	and	they	should	be	managed  by	reputable	companies	or	online	marketers.  Your	next	step	is	to	collect	contact	information	about	the	owners	of	these	websites	and  start	communicating	with	them.	One	of	the	best	ways	to	do	this	is	to	offer	to	do	a	guest  post	on	their	website.	Most	webmasters	will	welcome	an	opportunity	to	get	free	content	on  their	website.	They	will	review	your	content	before	they	give	it	the	go	signal	so	you	need  to	make	sure	that	it	is	of	high	quality.	You	will	need	2	days	to	create	a	well-researched	and  excellent	content	and	a	day	to	start	sending	out	emails.  On	the	14th	day,	you	should	review	on	the	improvement	of	your	ranking	and	what	other   tasks	you	can	do	to	improve	it	further.   Conclusion 	  Thank	you	again	for	downloading	this	book!

This	 eBook	 will	 teach	 you	 important	 information	 regarding	 Python.	 It	 will explain	 concepts	 and	 ideas	 that	 are	 being	 used	 by	 Python	 programmers. Additionally,	it	will	give	you	actual	codes	and	statements.	That	means	you’ll know	the	theoretical	and	practical	aspects	of	the	Python	language.  In	this	book	you	will	learn:   				What	Python	is   				How	to	use	Python   				Common	Python	data   				And	much	more!  Thanks	again	for	downloading	this	book.	I	hope	you	enjoy	it!    Chapter	1:	What	is	Python?  	  Python	is	an	advanced	and	structured	programming	language.	You	can	use	it to	 accomplish	 various	 programming	 tasks.	 Additionally,	 Python	 is	 an	 open- source	language:	thousands	of	computer	experts	across	the	globe	are	using	and improving	it	on	a	daily	basis.	A	Dutch	programmer	named	Guido	Van	Rossum created	Python	in	the	early	part	of	the	90s.	He	named	it	after	a	comedy	show titled	Monty	Python’s	Flying	Circus.  Computer	 experts	 consider	 Python	 as	 a	 powerful	 programming	 language. System	 administrators	 are	 using	 it	 to	 develop	 different	 types	 of	 computer software.	 Actually,	 Python	 has	 greatly	 helped	 in	 improving	 Linux	 systems. Most	of	Linux’s	main	components	are	written	using	Python.	IT	professors	also use	this	language	to	teach	basic	programming.	That	means	Python	is	versatile, powerful,	and	easy	to	learn.  Before	 execution,	 this	 programming	 language	 gets	 compiled	 into	 bytecode automatically.	The	system	saves	the	bytecode	onto	the	hard	disk.	That	means the	user	doesn’t	have	to	perform	compilation	unless	changes	are	made	on	the source.	 Additionally,	 Python	 is	 a	 dynamically	 typed	 programming	 language that	allows	 but	doesn’t	require 	object-oriented	constructs	and	features.  Unlike	 other	 programming	 languages,	 Python	 considers	 whitespace	 as	 an important	part	of	its	codes.	In	fact,	the	whitespace’s	significance	is	the	most distinctive	 attribute	 of	 Python.	 Rather	 than	 block	 delimiters	  which	 is	 being used	 by	 C	 programming	 languages ,	 Python	 uses	 indentation	 to	 indicate	 the starting	point	and	endpoint	of	code	blocks.   Another	cool	aspect	of	Python	is	that	it	is	available	for	ALL	platforms.	You can	 easily	 install	 and	 use	 Python	 on	 Linux,	 Macintosh,	 and	 Windows computers.	 That	 means	 computer	 programs	 written	 using	 this	 language	 are extremely	portable:	you	can	use	them	with	any	available	platform.   Chapter	2:	Python’s	Interactive	Mode  The	Python	programming	language	has	2	different	modes:  1.			Normal	–	In	this	mode,	you’ll	run	the	scripted	and	completed	Python  files	using	the	built-in	interpreter.  2.	 	 	Interactive	–	This	is	a	command	line	program	that	can	give	instant  feedback	for	each	of	your	statements.	This	mode	gives	feedback	while  performing	 previous	 statements	 stored	 in	 the	 machine’s	 memory.  Technically,	the	interactive	mode	evaluates	statements	individually	and  holistically	 while	 new	 ones	 are	 being	 entered	 into	 the	 Python  interpreter.  This	 chapter	 will	 focus	 on	 the	 interactive	 mode.	 To	 activate	 it,	 just	 enter “python”	without	adding	any	argument.	This	is	an	excellent	way	of	learning the	 programming	 language:	 you’ll	 play	 around	 statements	 and	 syntax variations.	After	typing	“python,”	the	screen	will	show	you	a	message	similar to	the	one	below:  	  	  	  	   Important	Note:	If	Python	doesn’t	work,	make	sure	that	you	have	set	your	path properly.  Notice	that	the	message	has	“>>>”	at	the	end.	These	symbols	indicate	that	you are	 using	 Python’s	 interactive	 mode.	 Here,	 the	 system	 will	 immediately	 run whatever	you	type.	Actually,	if	you’ll	type	1	+	1,	Python	will	give	you	2.	You can	use	this	mode	to	become	familiar	with	Python	and	test	its	capabilities.	If you	 have	 learned	 new	 statements,	 activate	 the	 interactive	 mode	 and	 check them	one	by	one.  The	image	below	shows	an	interactive	session:  As	you	can	see,	Python’s	interactive	environment	is	an	excellent	learning	and programming	tool.	However,	you	have	to	be	extremely	careful	when	using	it since	it	can	be	confusing	sometimes.	For	instance,	the	image	below	shows	a Python	script	that	is	considered	valid	in	the	interactive	mode:  If	 you’ll	 use	 this	 script	 as	 shown	 in	 the	 interactive	 mode,	 you’ll	 get	 a surprising	result:  	  	  	   The	Python	interpreter	says	that	the	second	print’s	indentation	is	unexpected. Before	writing	the	next	statement,	you	need	to	end	the	first	one	 i.e.	the	“if” statement 	 using	 a	 blank	 line.	 For	 instance,	 you	 must	 enter	 the	 statements using	this	format:  This	will	give	the	following	result:  	  	  The	Interactive	Mode  You	may	use	“-i”	to	activate	the	interactive	mode.	This	flag	will	stop	Python from	closing	when	the	program	is	done.	Computer	programmers	use	this	flag	a lot,	 especially	 during	 the	 prototyping	 and	 debugging	 stages.	 Here’s	 an example:   Chapter	3:	The	Basics  	  In	 this	 section,	 you’ll	 learn	 about	 the	 basics	 of	 the	 Python	 programming language.	The	following	pages	will	teach	you	how	to	create	programs	using Python.	 Additionally,	 you’ll	 know	 about	 the	 different	 parts	 of	 Python statements	such	as	strings	and	variables.	Study	this	chapter	carefully	because	it can	help	you	become	a	great	Python	user.  How	to	Create	Python	Programs  In	 general,	 programs	 created	 using	 Python	 are	 just	 ordinary	 text	 files.	 That means	 you	 can	 edit	 them	 with	 typical	 text	 editors.	 Use	 your	 favorite	 editor: you	can	create	or	improve	Python	programs	using	any	text	editing	software. However,	it	would	be	great	if	you	can	use	one	that	has	syntax	highlighting	for Python	statements.  Your	First	Program  Inexperienced	programmers	start	their	Python	journey	by	writing	the	“Hello, World!”	program.	Here,	the	program	simply	states	“Hello,	World!”	and	then closes	itself.		Try	this	simple	exercise:  1.			Access	your	favorite	text	editor.  2.	  	 	 Create	 a	 file	 and	 save	 it	 as	 “hello.py.”	 Inside	 that	 file,	 enter	 the  following	line:	  The	 “Hello,	 World!”	 program	 utilizes	 PRINT,	 a	 function	 that	 sends	 the parameters	of	a	statement	to	the	machine’s	terminal.	The	PRINT	function	adds   a	newline	character	to	the	statement’s	output.	Thus,	it	automatically	transfers the	cursor	to	the	subsequent	line.  Important	 Note:	 For	 Python	 version	 2,	 PRINT	 is	 considered	 as	 a	 statement instead	of	a	function.	That	means	you	may	use	it	without	any	parenthesis.	In this	situation,	PRINT	does	two	things:   							It	sends	the	whole	line	to	the	terminal   							It	allows	users	to	indicate	multiline	statements	by	placing	a	comma  after	the	last	character.  You’ve	just	completed	your	own	program.	Now,	you	are	ready	to	run	it	using Python.	 Notice	 that	 this	 procedure	 differs	 based	 on	 the	 OS	  i.e.	 operating system 	you	are	using.  For	Windows	computers:  1.	 	 	 Create	 a	 new	 folder.	 You	 should	 only	 use	 this	 folder	 for	 Python  computer	 programs.	 Save	 the	 hello.py	 file	 in	 this	 folder.	 For	 this  exercise,	let’s	assume	that	you	named	the	folder:	“C:\pythonfiles”  2.			Access	the	Start	menu	and	choose	“Run…”  3.			Open	the	OS’	terminal	by	typing	“cmd”	in	the	dialogue	box.  4.	  	 Type	 cd	 \pythonfiles	 and	 hit	 Enter.	 This	 action	 will	 set	 the  	  pythonfiles	folder	as	the	directory.  5.			Run	the	program	by	typing	hello.py	 i.e.	the	program’s	filename .  For	Mac	computers:    							Create	a	folder	that	will	be	used	for	Python	programs	only.	For	this  exercise,	name	this	folder	“pythonfiles”	and	save	it	in	your	computer’s  Home	folder	 i.e.	the	one	that	holds	folders	for	Music,	Movies,	Pictures,  Documents,	etc. .   							Save	the	hello.py	program	into	the	pythonfiles	folder.   	 	 	 	 	 	 	Access	the	Applications	section	of	your	computer,	go	to	Utilities,  and	activate	the	Terminal	software.   							Enter	cd	pythonfiles	into	the	dialogue	box	and	press	Enter.   							Run	the	Hello,	World!	program	by	typing	“python	. hello.py.”  For	Linux	computers:  file	in	it.   	 	 	 	 	 	 	Create	a	folder	and	name	it	“pythonfiles.”	Then,	save	the	hello.py   							Activate	the	computer’s	terminal	program.	Follow	these	instructions:  o	 	 	 	 	 	 For	 KDE	 users	 –	 go	 to	 the	 main	 menu	 and	 choose	 “Run  Command…”  o	 	 	 	 	 	 For	 GNOME	 users	 –	 go	 to	 the	 main	 menu,	 access	 the  Applications	section,	open	Accessories,	and	choose	Terminal.   							Enter	“cd	~ pythonpractice.”   							Run	the	program	by	typing	“python.	.hello.py.”  	   The	Outcome  The	screen	must	show:  Hello,	World!  That’s	 it.	 If	 your	 computer	 screen	 shows	 this	 message,	 you	 did	 an	 excellent job.	You’re	one	step	closer	to	being	a	great	Python	programmer.  	  The	Variables  The	Variables	and	Strings	in	the	Python	Language  This	 section	 will	 focus	 on	 strings	 and	 variables.	 As	 a	 beginner,	 you	 should know	that	these	two	types	of	data	play	a	huge	role	in	the	Python	programming language.  Basically,	 variables	 are	 things	 that	 hold	 changeable	 values.	 That	 means	 you can	consider	variables	as	boxes	that	can	hold	different	kinds	of	stuff.	Keep	in mind	that	you	can	use	variables	to	keep	different	things.	For	now,	however, let’s	use	them	for	storing	numbers.	Check	the	screenshot	below:  The	code	above	generates	a	variable	named	“lucky.”	Afterward,	it	assigns	the variable	to	a	number	 i.e.	7 .	If	you’ll	“ask”	Python	about	the	data	stored	in lucky,	you’ll	get	7	as	the	response.  You	may	also	edit	the	value	inside	variables.	For	instance:   With	the	codes	above,	you	saved	a	variable	named	“changing,”	assigned	the number	 3	 to	 it,	 and	 confirmed	 that	 the	 first	 statement	 is	 correct.	 Afterward, you	assigned	the	number	9	to	the	variable,	and	asked	the	system	about	the	new content.	The	Python	language	replaced	3	with	9.  Then,	you	created	a	new	variable	named	“different.”	You	assigned	the	number 12	 for	 this	 variable.	 That	 means	 you	 currently	 have	 two	 different	 variables, namely:	changing	and	different.	These	variables	hold	different	data	–	setting another	value	for	one	of	them	won’t	affect	the	other.  Python	allows	you	to	assign	the	value	of	an	existing	variable	to	a	different	one. For	instance:  To	prevent	confusion,	remember	that	the	variable’s	name	is	always	shown	on   the	 left	 side	 of	 the	 assignment	 operator	  i.e.	 the	 “=”	 sign .	 The	 variable’s value,	on	the	other	hand,	is	displayed	on	the	operator’s	right	side.	That	means for	each	variable,	you’ll	see	the	name	first	followed	by	the	value.  At	 first,	 the	 code	 created	 two	 variables:	 red	 and	 blue.	 Then	 it	 assigned different	 values	 for	 each:	 5	 and	 10,	 respectively.	 Notice	 that	 you	 can	 place different	arguments	on	the	PRINT	function	to	make	it	show	several	items	in	a single	line.	As	the	result	shows,	red	holds	5	while	blue	stores	10.  Then,	the	code	created	another	variable	and	named	it	“yellow.”	Afterward,	the code	instructed	Python	that	yellow’s	value	should	be	identical	to	that	of	red. Because	of	that,	Python	assigned	the	number	5	to	yellow.  Next,	the	code	instructed	Python	that	red’s	value	must	be	changed	so	that	it	is equal	to	that	of	blue.	The	value	of	blue	is	10	so	Python	assigns	that	number	to red	 the	number	5	is	“thrown	away” .	At	the	last	part	of	the	screenshot,	Python indicates	the	value	of	red,	blue	and	yellow:	10,	10,	5,	respectively.  Wait!	The	code	told	Python	that	the	value	of	yellow	must	be	equal	to	that	of red,	 didn’t	 it?	 Why	 does	 the	 screenshot	 show	 that	 yellow’s	 value	 is	 5	 even though	red’s	is	10?	It’s	simple.	The	code	instructed	the	Python	language	that yellow	should	have	red’s	value	at	the	moment	it	was	coded.	The	connection between	 red	 and	 yellow	 stopped	 as	 soon	 as	 Python	 assigned	 a	 value	 to	 the latter.	 Yellow	 received	 5	 -	 and	 5	 will	 stay	 regardless	 of	 what	 happens	 to	 its original	source	 unless	a	new	statement	is	given .  The	Strings  Basically,	strings	are	lists	of	characters	that	follow	a	certain	arrangement.  What	 is	 a	 “character?”	 Let’s	 relate	 this	 concept	 with	 a	 physical	 object:	 the keyboard.	 Anything	 you	 can	 enter	 using	 a	 keyboard	 is	 considered	 as	 a   character	 e.g.	numbers,	letters,	punctuation	marks,	etc. .  For	 instance,	 “Birthday”	 and	 “Halloween”	 are	 strings.	 These	 strings	 are formed	 by	 letters	  i.e.	 characters .	 You	 can	 also	 add	 spaces	 in	 your	 strings: “good	 morning”	 contains	 12	 characters:	 good	 =	 4,	 space	 =	 1,	 morning	 =	 7. Currently,	you	can	include	any	number	of	characters	in	your	Python	strings. That	means	there	are	no	limits	when	it	comes	to	the	quantity	of	characters	that you	can	use.	Actually,	you	can	even	create	a	string	that	has	no	character	in	it  programmers	call	it	an	“empty	string.” .  With	Python,	you	can	declare	strings	in	three	different	ways:  1.			 ‘ 	–	Using	single	quotation	marks  2.			 “ 	–	Using	double	quotation	marks  3.			 “”” 	–	Using	triple	quotation	marks  You	 can	 use	 any	 of	 these	 methods.	 However,	 make	 sure	 that	 you	 will	 be consistent	regarding	your	string	declarations.	Begin	and	end	your	strings	using the	same	declaration.	Check	the	screenshot	below:  As	you	can	see,	quotation	marks	start	and	end	strings.	By	default,	Python	will consider	the	quotation	marks	in	your	statements	as	markers	for	the	beginning or	end	of	strings.  In	 some	 situations,	 however,	 you	 have	 to	 include	 quotation	 marks	 in	 your statements.	 That	 means	 you	 must	 stop	 Python	 from	 ending	 your	 statements   prematurely	  i.e.	 when	 it	 sees	 the	 quotation	 marks	 in	 your	 codes .	 You	 can accomplish	 this	 using	 a	 backslash.	 By	 adding	 a	 backslash	 right	 before	 the quotation	 marks,	 you’re	 telling	 Python	 that	 those	 marks	 are	 included	 in	 the string.	The	act	of	putting	a	backslash	before	a	different	symbol	is	known	as “escaping”	that	particular	symbol.  Important	 Note:	 When	 adding	 a	 backslash	 to	 your	 Python	 strings,	 you	 still need	to	“escape”	it	 i.e.	place	a	backslash	before	the	needed	backslash .	This action	 will	 inform	 Python	 that	 the	 backslash	 must	 be	 used	 as	 an	 ordinary symbol.	Analyze	the	screenshot	below:  After	 analyzing	 the	 examples	 above,	 you’ll	 realize	 that	 only	 the	 characters used	 to	 quote	 strings	 must	 be	 escaped.	 This	 simple	 rule	 makes	 Python statements	easy	to	read.  To	help	you	understand	strings	further,	let’s	visit	your	first	Python	program:  Well,	it	seems	you	have	used	strings	even	before	you	learned	about	them.	You language. may	 also	 concatenate	 strings	 Concatenation	is	the	process	of	combining	two	different	strings	by	adding	a “+”	sign	between	them.	Let’s	use	the	same	program	again:  the	 Python	 programming	  in	   In	the	example	above,	“Hello,”	and	“world!”	are	entered	as	separate	strings. This	is	done	by	enclosing	both	strings	in	quotation	marks.	Then,	the	“+”	sign is	added	between	the	strings	to	combine	 i.e.	concatenate 	them.	Did	you	see the	 space	 between	 the	 comma	 and	 the	 quotation	 mark?	 That	 space	 is mandatory:	without	it,	you’ll	get	the	following	string:  Python	also	allows	you	to	repeat	strings.	That	means	you	won’t	have	to	type the	same	thing	several	times.	To	repeat	strings,	just	use	the	asterisk:  Lastly,	you	can	utilize	“len  ”	to	count	the	characters	that	form	any	string.	You just	have	to	place	the	string	you	want	to	check	inside	the	parentheses.	Here’s an	example:  Variables	and	Strings	–	How	to	Use	Them	Together  Now	that	you	know	how	strings	and	variables	work,	you’re	ready	to	use	them together.  As	discussed	earlier,	variables	can	hold	different	types	of	information	–	even strings.	Here’s	an	example:  The	 program	 above	 creates	 a	 variable	 named	 “question.”	 Then,	 it	 stores	 the string	“What	did	you	have	for	lunch?”	inside	that	variable.	Lastly,	it	instructs Python	to	give	out	the	string.   It	is	important	to	note	that	you	should	not	enclose	the	variable	with	quotation marks.	By	omitting	quotation	marks,	you	are	telling	Python	that	you	are	using “question”	as	a	variable,	not	as	a	string.	If	you’ll	enclose	the	variable	using quotation	marks,	Python	will	consider	it	as	an	ordinary	string.	It	will	give	out “question”	rather	than	“What	did	you	have	for	lunch?”  How	to	Combine	Strings	and	Numbers  Analyze	the	screenshot	below:  This	code	is	designed	to	accept	a	number	from	the	programmer,	add	ten	to	that number,	 and	 give	 out	 the	 sum.	 If	 you’ll	 run	 it,	 however,	 you’ll	 get	 the following	error	message:  What’s	 happening	 here?	 Instead	 of	 giving	 out	 a	 number,	 Python	 shows “TypeError.”	 This	 message	 means	 there	 is	 an	 issue	 with	 the	 information entered.	 To	 be	 specific,	 Python	 cannot	 determine	 how	 to	 combine	 the	 two kinds	of	data	being	used:	strings	and	integers.  For	instance,	Python	assumes	that	“number”	 i.e.	a	variable 	contains	a	string, rather	than	a	number.	If	the	programmer	types	in	“15,”	Python	will	think	that the	variable	holds	a	2-character	string:	1	and	5.	What	can	you	do	to	inform Python	that	15	is	a	number?  Additionally,	 when	 asking	 for	 the	 answer,	 you	 are	 instructing	 Python	 to   combine	 a	 number	  i.e.	 plusTen 	 and	 a	 string.	 The	 programming	 language doesn’t	know	how	to	accomplish	that.	Python	can	only	combine	two	strings. How	can	you	make	Python	treat	numbers	as	strings,	so	you	can	use	it	with	a different	string?  Fortunately,	you	have	two	powerful	functions	at	your	disposal:  1.			str  	–	This	function	can	convert	numbers	into	strings.  2.			int  	–	This	function	can	convert	strings	into	numbers.  When	using	these	functions,	you	just	have	to	place	the	string number	you	want to	 convert	 inside	 the	 parentheses.	 If	 you	 will	 apply	 this	 method	 to	 the	 code given	earlier,	you	will	get	the	following	result:  The	Fundamental	Concepts  Python	has	5	basic	concepts,	namely:  1.			Scope	–	For	large	systems,	you	have	to	limit	the	relationship	between  codes.	This	is	important	if	you	want	to	prevent	errors	or	unpredictable  system	behaviors.	If	you	won’t	restrict	the	effect	of	your	codes	on	other  codes,	the	entire	system	might	get	confused.  You	can	control	the	“scope”	of	your	codes	by	assigning	specific	name groups	to	each	programmer.	For	instance,	one	programmer	will	use	the names	 of	 countries	 while	 another	 one	 uses	 names	 of	 animals.	 This   technique	 can	 help	 in	 limiting	 the	 connections	 between	 your	 Python codes.  2.	 	 	 Objects	 –	 Similar	 to	 other	 object-oriented	 languages,	 Python	 uses  code	and	data	groups.  In	Python,	you’ll	create	 i.e.	instantiate 	objects	using	“Classes”	 a	set of	 templates	 used	 in	 this	 programming	 language .	 Objects	 possess “attributes,”	which	store	the	different	pieces	of	data	and	code	that	form the	object.  Accessing	an	object’s	attribute	is	easy:  i.										Enter	the	object’s	name	and	place	a	dot	after	it.  ii.								Specify	the	name	of	the	attribute s	you	want	to	access.  3.			Namespaces	–	Python	has	dir  ,	a	preinstalled	function	that	can	help  you	understand	namespaces.	After	starting	Python’s	interpreter,	you	can  use	dir  	to	show	the	objects	in	the	default	or	current	namespace.	Check  the	screenshot	below:  You	 can	 also	 use	 dir  	 to	 list	 the	 available	 names	 inside	 module namespaces.	For	this	example,	let’s	use	type  	on	_builtins_	 an	object from	 the	 screenshot	 above .	 This	 function,	 i.e.	 type  ,	 	 allows	 us	 to know	the	file	type	of	an	object.	See	the	screenshot	below:   The	image	shows	that	_builtins_	is	a	module.	That	means	you	can	use dir  	to	list	the	names	inside	_builtins_.	You’ll	get	this	result:  This	concept	is	easy	to	understand.	Basically,	namespaces	are	places	in which	names	can	reside.	Every	name	inside	a	namespace	is	completely different	from	those	outside	a	namespace.	Computer	programmers	refer to	this	“namespace	layering”	as	“scope.”	In	general,	you	should	place names	inside	a	namespace	if	those	names	have	values.	For	instance:  The	image	above	shows	that	you	can	add	names	to	any	namespace	just by	using	a	simple	statement	 i.e.	“import” .	That	code	used	the	import statement	to	add	“math”	to	the	active	namespace.	If	you	want	to	know what	that	object	is,	you	can	run	this	command:  It	says	that	“math”	is	a	module.	Thus,	it	has	its	own	namespace.	You can	show	the	names	inside	math’s	namespace	using	the	dir  	function:   	  4.	 	 	Case	Sensitivity	–	Variables	are	always	case-sensitive.	That	means  “SMITH,”	“Smith,”	and	“smith”	are	three	different	variables.  5.	 	 	 Tabs	 and	 Spaces	 Don’t	 Mix	 –	 Since	 whitespaces	 are	 important	 in  Python,	 keep	 in	 mind	 that	 tabs	 and	 spaces	 cannot	 be	 mixed.	 Be  consistent	while	indenting	your	python	statements.	If	you’ll	use	spaces  for	indention,	stick	to	that	character.	This	is	an	important	concept	that  many	beginners	forget	about.  Although	tabs	and	spaces	have	the	same	appearance,	they	give	different meanings	 when	 read	 by	 the	 Python	 interpreter.	 That	 means	 you’ll experience	errors	or	weird	results	if	you’ll	mix	them	in	your	statements.  Important	Note:	If	you	prefer	to	use	spaces,	make	sure	that	you	will	hit the	spacebar	four	times	for	each	indention.   Chapter	4:	Sequences  	  Lists  Sequences,	 one	 of	 the	 basic	 structures	 in	 programming,	 allow	 you	 to	 save values	 easily	 and	 efficiently.	 	 Python	 supports	 three	 types	 of	 sequences, namely:	lists,	tuples,	and	strings.	Let’s	discuss	each	sequence	in	detail:  As	 their	 name	 suggests,	 lists	 are	 collections	 of	 values	 that	 follow	 a	 certain arrangement.	 You	 can	 use	 square	 brackets	 to	 create	 a	 list.	 For	 instance,	 you can	use	the	statement	below	to	initialize	an	empty	list:  You	should	use	commas	to	separate	values.	Here’s	a	sample	list:  You	can	place	different	kinds	of	values	inside	the	same	list.	For	instance,	the list	above	holds	numbers	and	letters.  Similar	to	characters	within	a	string,	you	can	access	listed	items	using	indices that	start	at	zero.	Accessing	a	listed	item	is	easy.	You	just	have	to	specify	the name	of	the	list	where	that	item	belongs.	Then,	indicate	the	number	of	the	item inside	the	list.	Enclose	the	number	using	square	brackets.	Here’s	an	example:   Python	also	allows	you	to	enter	negative	integers.	These	numbers	are	counted backwards,	starting	from	the	last	item	in	the	list.  You	may	use	len  	to	determine	the	quantity	of	items	inside	a	list.	Check	the image	below:  Lists	are	similar	to	typical	variables	in	one	aspect:	they	allow	you	to	change the	items	inside	them.	Analyze	the	following	example:  You	can	also	slice	strings:  Python	 offers	 different	 methods	 of	 adding	 items	 to	 any	 list.	 However,	 the easiest	method	is	this:   To	remove	items,	you	can	apply	the	“del”	statement	onto	the														list. Here’s	an	example:  Lists	automatically	“fix”	themselves	after	each	item	deletion.	That	means	you won’t	see	any	gap	in	the	numbering	of	items.  Tuples	and	lists	are	similar	except	for	one	thing:	tuples	cannot	be	edited.	After creating	a	tuple,	you	won’t	be	able	to	change	it	in	any	way.	You	can’t	expand, edit,	or	delete	the	elements	within	a	tuple.	If	you’ll	ignore	this	immutability, you	can	say	that	lists	and	tuples	are	identical.  You	should	use	commas	when	declaring	tuples:  Sometimes,	you	have	to	differentiate	tuples	using	parentheses.	This	process	is similar	to	performing	several	assignments	using	the	same	line.	Here’s	a	simple example:  Tuples  	  Strings   You’ve	 already	 learned	 about	 strings.	 However,	 it	 is	 important	 to	 discuss	 it again	as	a	Python	sequence.	For	other	programming	languages,	you	can	access the	 characters	 elements	 inside	 strings	 using	 square	 brackets	  known	 as	 the subscript	operator .	This	method	is	also	effective	in	Python:  Python	assigns	numbers	to	indices	using	this	formula:	0	–	n1	 n	represents	the number	of	characters	in	the	string .	Check	the	screenshot	below:  Indices	 work	 with	 the	 characters	 that	 come	 right	 after	 them.	 For	 negative indices,	you	should	count	backwards:  Unlike	 other	 programming	 languages,	 Python	 allows	 you	 to	 place	 up	 to	 2 numbers	inside	square	brackets.	You	can	do	this	using	a	colon	 i.e.	“:” .	For sequences	 that	 concentrate	 on	 numeric	 indices,	 the	 combination	 of	 brackets and	 colons	 returns	 the	 portion	 between	 the	 indices.	 This	 technique	 is	 called “slicing.”	 If	 you’ll	 slice	 a	 string,	 you	 will	 get	 “substrings.”	 Analyze	 the screenshot	below:   The	statements	given	above	show	an	important	rule:  “If	you’ll	omit	a	number,	Python	assumes	the	missing	number	as	the	start	or end	 of	 that	 particular	 sequence	  depending	 on	 the	 position	 of	 the	 missing number .”  Dictionaries  Dictionaries	 are	 similar	 to	 lists.	 Unlike	 tuples,	 dictionaries	 allow	 users	 to modify	their	content.	That	means	you	may	add,	edit,	and	delete	the	elements of	any	dictionary.	The	main	difference	between	lists	and	dictionaries	is	this: dictionaries	don’t	bind	their	elements	to	any	number.  A	dictionary’s	element	has	two	aspects:	 1 	the	key	and	 2 	the	value.	If	you’ll call	the	key	of	a	dictionary,	you’ll	get	the	values	related	to	that	particular	key. Computer	programmers	consider	lists	as	special	dictionaries,	where	numbers represent	the	key	of	each	element.  How	to	Use	a	Dictionary  You	should	use	curly	braces	when	declaring	a	dictionary.	Also,	you	should	use the	following	format	when	declaring	elements	for	a	dictionary:	 1 	enter	the key	 of	 the	 element,	  2 	 add	 a	 colon,	 and	  3 	 assign	 the	 value.	 Here’s	 an example:   Additionally,	 adding	 elements	 to	 dictionaries	 is	 simple	 and	 easy.	 It’s	 like adding	an	ordinary	variable:   Chapter	5:	The	Different	Types	of	Data  	  Basically,	 data	 types	 define	 an	 object’s	 capabilities.	 In	 other	 languages,	 the effectiveness	 of	 an	 operation	 is	 tested	 by	 ensuring	 that	 the	 object	 cannot	 be stored	where	the	operation	is	going	to	be	performed.	This	system	is	known	as static	typing.  However,	 Python	 uses	 a	 different	 approach.	 This	 programming	 language allows	you	to	store	the	object’s	data	type	inside	that	object.	Python	also	checks the	validity	of	each	operation	as	soon	as	you	run	them.	Programmers	refer	to this	system	as	dynamic	typing.  This	 chapter	 focuses	 on	 the	 different	 kinds	 of	 data	 that	 you	 can	 use	 with Python.  Python	has	a	set	of	standard	data	types.	These	types	are	pre-installed	into	this programming	 language.	 Let’s	 divide	 these	 types	 into	 small	 groups.	 This section	will	use	the	hierarchy	system	used	in	Python’s	official	documentation:  The	Standard	Types  The	Numeric	Types  longs.   							int	–	This	stands	for	integers.	For	Python	2.x,	“int”	is	identical	to	C   							long	–	It	stands	for	long	integers	whose	length	is	non-limited.	You’ll  find	this	type	in	systems	that	use	Python	2.x.   							float	–	This	stands	for	floating-point	numbers.	Float	is	the	equivalent   of	doubles	in	C.   							complex	–	This	type	is	composed	of	complex	numbers.  The	Sequences   							list   							tuple   							byte	–	This	is	a	sequence	of	numbers	within	the	0-255	range.	You’ll  find	bytes	in	systems	that	use	Python	3.x.   							byte	array	–	This	is	the	mutable	version	of	bytes.   							str	–	This	stands	for	“String.”	Python	2.x	systems	represent	strings	as  sequences	of	8-bit	items.	Python	3.x	systems,	however,	represent	them  as	sequences	of	Unicode	items.  The	Sets   							set	–	This	is	an	unorganized	group	of	distinct	objects.   							frozen	set	–	This	type	is	the	immutable	version	of	sets.  The	Mappings   	 	 	 	 	 	 	dict	–	This	stands	for	Python	dictionaries.	Computer	programmers  refer	to	this	type	as	a	“hashmap”	or	“associative	array.”	In	general,	each  element	of	a	dictionary	has	a	corresponding	definition.  Mutable	and	Immutable	Objects  In	the	Python	language,	data	types	are	categorized	based	on	the	mutability	of   their	 contents.	 Keep	 in	 mind	 that	 immutable	 data	 types	 prevent	 you	 from changing	 the	 objects	 inside	 them.	 That	 means	 you’ll	 succeed	 in	 slicing	 or reassigning	the	objects	of	mutable	data.	Immutable	ones,	however,	will	give you	an	error	message.  Here’s	an	important	principle	that	you	should	remember:	variables	are	simple references	 to	 the	 objects	 inside	 a	 machine’s	 memory.	 Let’s	 assume	 that	 you paired	an	object	and	a	variable	using	the	following	statement:  With	 the	 statement	 given	 above,	 you	 are	 making	 variables	  i.e.	 1,	 a,	 and	 s  point	to	certain	objects.	Python	stores	this	relationship	between	variables	and objects	in	the	machine’s	memory.	Thus,	you	can	conveniently	access	objects whenever	you	want.  For	the	next	example,	let’s	say	you	performed	a	reassignment	using	the	code below:  In	 this	 new	 statement,	 you	 linked	 the	 variables	 to	 other	 objects.	 As	 you’ve learned	earlier,	you	can	only	change	mutable	objects	 1	[0]	=	1	is	good,	but	s [0]	=	“a”	will	give	you	an	error	message .  How	to	Create	Objects	of	a	Defined	Type   	 	 	 	 	 	 	Literal	Integers 	–	You	can	enter	literal	integers	in	three	different  ways:   o						For	decimal	numbers	–	You	can	enter	these	numbers	directly.  o						For	hexadecimal	numbers	–	You	have	to	prepend	0X	or	0x	to  enter	this	kind	of	number.  o	 	 	 	 	 	 For	 octal	 literals	 –	 The	 method	 of	 entering	 these	 integers  depends	on	the	Python	version	you	are	using:  ▪	 	 	 	 	 	 	 For	 Python	 2.x	 –	 You	 must	 prepend	 a	 zero	 to	 enter  ▪							For	Python	3.x	–	You	should	prepend	0O	or	00	to	enter  octals.  octals.  integer   integer .   							Floating	Point	Integers 	–	You	can	enter	these	numbers	directly.   							Long	Integers	–	You	can	enter	a	long	integer	in	two	ways:  o	 	 	 	 	 	 Directly	  112233445566778899	 is	 considered	 as	 a	 long  o	 	 	 	 	 	 By	 appending	 the	 letter	 “L”	  1L	 is	 considered	 as	 a	 long  involves	 short	 If	 a	 computation	 automatically	converted	into	a	long	integer.  that	  integers	 overflows,	  it	  is   	 	 	 	 	 	 	 Complex	 Numbers 	 –	 You	 can	 enter	 this	 object	 by	 adding	 two  numbers	  i.e.	 a	 real	 number	 and	 an	 imaginary	 number .	 Then,	 enter  these	numbers	by	appending	the	letter	“j.”	That	means	11+2j	and	11j	are  complex	numbers.    	 	 	 	 	 	 	Strings	–	You	can	enter	strings	as	single-	or	triple-quoted	objects.  The	difference	between	these	two	types	lies	in	their	delimiters	and	their  potential	 length.	 Single-quoted	 strings	 are	 restricted	 to	 one	 line	 only.  You	 can	 enter	 single-quoted	 strings	 using	 pairs	 of	 single	 quotation	 or  double	quotation	marks.	Check	the	following	example:  Triple-quoted	strings	are	similar	to	their	single-quoted	counterparts,	but they	 can	 cover	 multiple	 lines.	 Obviously,	 their	 delimiters	  i.e.	 the quotation	marks 	should	be	matched.	You	must	enter	these	strings	using 3	single	or	double	quotation	marks.	Here’s	an	instructive	screenshot	for you:   	 	 	 	 	 	 	 Tuples	 -	 You	 can	 enter	 tuples	 using	 parentheses.	 Place	 commas  between	objects	to	separate	them.  You	can	enter	a	single-element	tuple	by	enclosing	it	in	parentheses	and adding	a	comma.	Here’s	an	example:    							Lists	-	Lists	work	like	tuples,	though	they	require	square	brackets:   							Dictionaries 	–	You	can	create	“Python	dicts”	by	listing	some	pairs  of	 values	 and	 separating	 each	 pair	 using	 a	 colon.	 Use	 commas	 to  separate	 dictionary	 entries.	 Then,	 enclose	 the	 statements	 using	 curly  braces.	Check	the	image	below:  Null	Objects  Python	 uses	 “None”	 as	 a	 null	 pointer	 analogue.	 In	 this	 aspect,	 Python	 is similar	 to	 many	 programming	 languages.	 Actually,	 “None”	 isn’t	 a	 null reference	or	a	null	pointer	in	itself	–	it	is	an	object	that	only	has	one	instance. You	can	use	“None”	as	a	default	argument	value	for	functions.	In	Python,	you must	compare	objects	against	“None”	using	“is”	instead	of	“==.”   Chapter	6:	The	Errors	That	You	Will	Encounter  Python	 users	 encounter	 three	 kinds	 of	 errors:	 exceptions,	 logic	 errors,	 and syntax	errors.  These	 errors	 occur	 when	 the	 Python	 interpreter	 cannot	 perform	 an	 action, though	it	knows	what	should	be	done.	A	good	example	would	be	running	a Google	 search	 while	 you	 are	 offline:	 the	 machine	 knows	 what	 to	 do	 but	 it cannot	accomplish	it.  Logic	 errors	 are	 extremely	 hard	 to	 find.	 Also,	 they	 are	 the	 most	 common errors	 that	 you’ll	 get.	 Python	 programs	 that	 are	 affected	 by	 logic	 errors	 can still	run.	However,	they	may	crash	or	produce	unexpected	results.  You	can	use	a	debugger	to	find	and	solve	logic	errors	in	your	programs.  Exceptions  Logic	Errors  Syntax	Errors  This	is	perhaps	the	most	basic	kind	of	error.	A	syntax	error	occurs	when	the Python	 interpreter	 cannot	 understand	 a	 code.	 According	 to	 programmers, syntax	 errors	 are	 fatal	 most	 of	 the	 time	 –	 you	 cannot	 execute	 codes	 that contain	this	error.  Syntax	 errors	 are	 often	 caused	 by	 typos,	 wrong	 arguments,	 or	 wrong indentation.	 That	 means	 you	 should	 inspect	 your	 codes	 for	 these	 mistakes whenever	you	encounter	a	syntax	error.  	  	   	  	  	  	   I’d	like	to	thank	you	for	taking	time	to	read	my	book.
