Written by leading thinkers, the  books in this series deliver expert overviews of subjects  that range from the cultural and the historical to the sci- entific and the technical.  In today’s era of instant information gratification, we  have ready access to opinions, rationalizations, and super- ficial descriptions. Much harder to come by is the founda- tional knowledge that informs a principled understanding  of  the  world.  Essential  Knowledge  books  fill  that  need.  Synthesizing specialized subject matter for nonspecialists  and engaging critical topics through fundamentals, each  of these compact volumes offers readers a point of access  to complex ideas.  Bruce Tidor Professor of Biological Engineering and Computer Science Massachusetts Institute of Technology  10237.indb   7  9 25 15   10:41 AM   10237.indb   8  9 25 15   10:41 AM   PrefaCe  This book was borne largely out of a massive open online  course  MOOC  that I taught for the University of North  Carolina at Chapel Hill on the Coursera platform, in the  fall of 2013 and again in the spring of 2014, titled “Meta- data:  Organizing  and  Discovering  Information.”  Online  teaching and learning is not a new idea by any means, but  MOOCs focused a great deal of attention on this form of  pedagogy, both inside and outside the academy. I had been  teaching online for many years when MOOCs hit the news  in 2011, but the sheer scale of a MOOC captured my atten- tion. I got to thinking about what teaching and learning  in Information Science might look like, if it were entirely  online. I believed then, and still do, that the first course  in any Information Science curriculum should be a course  on metadata: almost everything else in the field depends  on metadata, and the subject provides a hook into most of  the issues in the field. So when Carolina decided to launch  its MOOC initiative, I was very excited to have the oppor- tunity to launch a course on metadata, to put my ideas to  the test.  I’m very pleased about how well the metadata MOOC  was  received.  And  I’m  equally  pleased  that  the  course  caused metadata to come to the attention of the editors of  the MIT Press, as a topic worthy of being included in the   Preface  10237.indb   9  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Essential Knowledge series. So my first thank you must be  to Margy Avery, for first suggesting the idea of this book. Naturally I also must thank the University of North  Carolina at Chapel Hill, for launching its MOOC initiative  in the first place, and for supporting us MOOC instructors  during the production process. I must also express a great  deal  of  thanks  to  my  teaching  assistant  for  the  MOOC,  Meredith Lewis.  I would like to thank the nearly 50,000 students who  registered  for  the  course…  and  especially  to  the  17,464  students  who  actually  participated  in  the  course  across  both sessions.  I  recorded  several  interviews  for  the  MOOC,  with  people who are doing interesting and cutting-edge things  with metadata. This provided  I hope  useful supplemen- tary material for the course, and saved the students from  having to watch my ugly mug all the time. I learned a great  deal  in  conducting  these  interviews,  and  that  inevitably  made it into this book as well. So let me thank my inter- viewees:  Murtha  Baca,  of  the  Getty  Research  Institute;  Robert Glushko, Adjunct Full Professor in the School of  Information  at  the  University  of  California  at  Berkeley;  Steve  Hogan,  Music  Analyst  at  Pandora;  Hunter  Janes,  Data Analyst at Red Storm Entertainment; Clifford Lynch,  Director of the Coalition for Networked Information; and  Jason Scott, of the Internet Archive.  x     Preface  10237.indb   10  9 25 15   10:41 AM   The interviews for the MOOC went so well that I de- cided to do some more, specifically for this book. Thanks  to Mary Forster, Joel Steinpreis, and Joel Summerlin of  Getty Images for a fascinating conversation about image  metadata.  Thanks to Clifford Lynch, again, for bringing pen regis- ters to my attention, and for pointing me in the right direc- tion while researching the history of the word “metadata.” Thanks to Ted Johnson, of Studio 713, for helping me   to understand music metadata.  Thanks to Jessamyn West, for helping me find images   of catalog cards.  This book is dedicated to my daughters, Charlotte and  Eleanor, who thought it was cool that I was writing a book.

In the modern era  of ubiquitous electronics, nearly every device you use relies  on metadata or generates it, or both. But when metadata  is doing its job well, it just fades into the background, un- noticed and nearly invisible. And this is partly how, in the  summer of 2013, metadata came to be a cause célèbre.  Edward Snowden, a subcontractor to the United States  National Security Agency, flew to Hong Kong in May of  2013 to meet with journalists from The Guardian. There,  Snowden handed over a large number of classified docu- ments  about  the  NSA’s  surveillance  program  within  the  United  States.  One  of  these  programs,  PRISM,  included  collecting data on telephone calls directly from telecom- munications companies. Needless to say, this was very big  news when The Guardian published the story.  Reactions  in  the  US  media  to  the  Snowden  revela- tions were varied, and their evolution was significant. The   10237.indb   1  9 25 15   10:41 AM   immediate reaction was anger that the NSA was collect- ing data on US citizens. This was quickly tempered by re- lief, when it became clear that the NSA was only collecting  metadata  about  calls,  and  not  the  calls  themselves—in  other  words,  the  NSA  was  not  engaging  in  wiretapping.  After that came punditry, as the media explored just how  much  information  about  individuals  could  be  inferred  from “only” metadata.  The  MetaPhone  study,  conducted  by  researchers  at  the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society  in late 2013, attempted to replicate the NSA’s data collec- tion of phone metadata. What they discovered was that  a truly incredible amount of information can be inferred  from “only” metadata. One example that the MetaPhone  researchers  report  is  of  a  study  participant  who  called  “a  home  improvement  store,  locksmiths,  a  hydroponics  dealer, and a head shop.” Perhaps this individual had per- fectly innocent reasons for placing all of these calls, and  perhaps these calls were entirely unrelated… but that’s not  the inference that most of us are likely to make.  A lot of metadata is associated with phone calls, par- ticularly cell phone calls. Probably the most obvious pieces  of  metadata  about  a  call  are  the  phone  numbers  of  the  caller and the recipient. Then, of course, there’s the time  and duration of the call. And for calls made from smart- phones—most  of  which  have  GPS  functionality—there  are the locations of the caller and the recipient, at least to   2     chaPter 1  10237.indb   2  9 25 15   10:41 AM   the level of precision of the range of the cell phone towers  in which the phones are located. There’s more metadata  than  this  associated  with  cell  phone  calls,  but  even  this  small amount is enough to give privacy advocates pause.  Because your phone exchanges data with local cell towers,  even when you’re not on a call. And, of course, your phone  is presumably being carried by you. A record of your loca- tion at any given moment, and your movements over time,  may therefore be collected by your cell phone service pro- vider … and is in fact collected, as the Snowden revelations  revealed.  Thus did the word “metadata” enter the public conver- sation. Though, given how pervasive metadata is, a public  conversation about it is probably overdue; it deserves to be  better understood. In the modern era of ubiquitous com- puting, metadata has become infrastructural, like the elec- trical grid or the highway system. These pieces of modern  infrastructure are indispensible but are also only the tip of  the iceberg: when you flick on a lightswitch, for example,  you are the end user of a large set of technologies and poli- cies. Individually, these technologies and policies may be  minor, and may seem trivial… but in the aggregate, they  have far-reaching cultural and economic implications. And  it’s the same with metadata. Metadata, like the electrical  grid and the highway system, fades into the background of  everyday life, taken for granted as just part of what makes  modern life run smoothly.     IntroductIon      3  10237.indb   3  9 25 15   10:41 AM   As  citizens  of  the  modern  world  we  all  are  familiar  with and have a reasonable  though probably incomplete   understanding of the electrical grid and the highway sys- tem, and many other pieces of modern infrastructure. But  unless you’re an information scientist—or an intelligence  analyst working for the NSA—the same is probably not  true of metadata.  And so we arrive at the purpose of this book. This book  will introduce you to the topic of metadata, and the wide  range of topics and issues that metadata touches on. We  will discuss what metadata is, and why it exists. We will  look at a range of different types of metadata, for different  users and use cases. We will talk about some of the tech- nologies that make modern metadata possible, and we will  speculate about the future of metadata. And by the end of  the book, you will be seeing metadata everywhere.  It’s metadata’s world, and you’re just living in it.  Invisible Metadata  When you picked up this book from your local bookstore  shelves, you were using metadata. What attracted you to  this book, to cause you to pick it up? Was it the title, the  publisher, the cover art? Whatever it was, it almost cer- tainly was not the content of the book itself. Of course,  now that you are reading this, you have some information   4     chaPter 1  10237.indb   4  9 25 15   10:41 AM   about the content of this book, but you did not have that  information before you picked it up. You had to rely on  other  cues,  other  pieces  of  information  about  the  book.  Those  other  pieces  of  information  are  metadata:  data  about this book.  When metadata is doing its job well, it fades into the  background, almost to the point of being invisible. You’re  so  used  to  seeing  books  with  titles  and  publishers  and  cover  art,  that  it  probably  didn’t  even  register  with  you  that this book has those things too. It would probably only  have registered if this book didn’t have a title or publisher  or cover art. We’re so conditioned to metadata about books  being part of our book-buying environment that we don’t  even  think  about  it.  We’re  so  conditioned  to  metadata  about lots of things being part of our everyday environ- ment that we don’t even think about it. How did it come  to be this way?  A Brief History of Metadata  The word metadata only came into the English language in  1968, but the idea of metadata goes back to the first library.  The  word  is  a  deliberate  play  on  Aristotle’s  Metaphysics.  Though Aristotle never called those particular works by that  name, they have historically been collected together under  that  title,  to  indicate  that  they  came  after,  or  dealt  with      IntroductIon      5  10237.indb   5  9 25 15   10:41 AM   topics  beyond  the  Physics.  Similarly  the  word  “metadata”  indicates something that is beyond the data: a statement  or statements about the data. Linguistically this is a loose  translation of the Greek prefix “meta-,” but it is consistent  with what has become the everyday use of the word “meta,”  to indicate something at a higher level of abstraction.  Although the word “metadata” is only a few decades  old, librarians have been working with metadata for thou- sands of years. Though what we now call “metadata” has  historically  just  been  called  “information  in  the  library  catalog.” The information in a library catalog is intended  to solve a very specific problem: to help users of the library  find materials in the library’s collection.  The Pinakes is considered by historians to be the first  library catalog, created by Callimachus for the Library of  Alexandria, around 245 BC. Only fragments of the Pinakes  have survived the intervening millennia, but here’s what  is known: works were listed by genre, title, and author’s  name,  along  with  some  biographical  information  about  each author. Additionally a summary, and the total num- ber of lines of a work were included. Fast-forward more  than two thousand years, and we’re still using many of the  same pieces of information in library catalogs: author, sub- ject, blurb, length.  To  be  fair,  however,  we  now  use  more  pieces  of  in- formation  in  library  catalogs  than  Callimachus  did.  The  call number of the work is ubiquitous: a number or other   6     chaPter 1  10237.indb   6  9 25 15   10:41 AM   alphanumeric  string,  according  to  some  scheme   the  Dewey decimal system, for example , that lets the library  user locate a work on the shelves. Call numbers are espe- cially critical for large collections, as users must navigate  the correspondingly large physical space occupied by the  collection to find individual items. It’s difficult to imagine  how Callimachus could have developed the Pinakes with- out also inventing call numbers, since the Library of Alex- andria is said to have included half a million works, which  is a fairly large collection even by modern standards.  The Pinakes was a set of scrolls. If you have ever read  from the Torah in synagogue, you know that a scroll is not  the most user-friendly interface: moving between sections  is a challenge. Indeed there’s an entire holiday in the Jew- ish  calendar   Simchat  Torah   that  celebrates  coming  to  the end of reading the Torah, and rolling the whole thing  back to the beginning. If you’ve never read from the To- rah,  think  about  using  other  scroll-like  technologies:  an  audiocassette, or a VHS tape. Indeed stickers exhorting us  to “Be kind, please rewind” used to be common on rental  VHS tapes. In short, the Pinakes could not have been a pic- nic from the standpoint of usability.  The codex—what we moderns just call the book—is in  many ways a superior user interface to the scroll. Thus, in- evitably, once the codex was invented, it was adopted for  use as library catalogs. Library catalogs in book form were  often what is called a “shelf list,” which is exactly what it      IntroductIon      7  10237.indb   7  9 25 15   10:41 AM   sounds like: a list of books on the shelves, often in the or- der in which they were acquired by the library. This order  makes it easy to add new entries—just write them in at the  end—but is still not very user-friendly when one wants to  find an individual item in the list.  The library catalog made a great leap forward with the  invention of the card catalog in France, around the time of  the French Revolution. This innovation atomized the shelf  list, making it simple to add or remove entries, as well as to  find entries for individual items. A scroll or a codex cannot  be easily edited once completed, but to add an entry into  a card catalog, all you have to do is slip a new card into the  correct spot.  The card catalog atomized the library catalog by mak- ing each record—each entry for a book—an individual ob- ject that could be manipulated independently. The pieces  of data within each record, however—the title of the book,  the author’s name, and so on—had been atomized all the  way back to the Pinakes. Even if the individual pieces of  data on a catalog card are not labeled as title, author, etc.,  it’s understood what categories each piece of data repre- sents. Thus the catalog card is atomized along two dimen- sions: records for individual items, and categories of data  shared by all items.  And with that atomization along two dimensions, we  arrive  at  databases,  and  the  modern  approach  to  meta- data. When you break up a dataset into records, where each   8     chaPter 1  10237.indb   8  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Figure 1  record represents an individual item, and records contain  categories  of  data,  where  each  category  is  shared  across  items, you have essentially just invented the spreadsheet. Imagine a spreadsheet: each row is a record for a single  object, and each column is a single characteristic of those  objects. Now imagine a spreadsheet containing data about  books. What would be the headers of our columns? Title,  author, publisher, date of publication, place of publication,  subject,  call  number,  number  of  pages,  format,  dimen- sions, you name it. Each row, then, would be a record for  a single book, containing all of these pieces of data about  that specific book. Such a spreadsheet could be used as a  library catalog.

The scientist and philosopher Alfred Korzybski is per- haps best remembered for his quote, “the map is not the  territory”  a quote that is frequently misattributed to Mar- shall McLuhan . This quote has been analyzed and com- mented upon for nearly a hundred years, in both science  and art  including by McLuhan . Korzybski first wrote this  line in a paper about language, and it’s language that will  be discussed in this section.  Language is a map, according to Korzybski. Language  is a means by which we collapse the incredible complexity  of the world down into a much simpler form. The word for   10     chaPter 1  10237.indb   10  9 25 15   10:41 AM   a thing is not the thing itself: the name Jeffrey is not me,  in any meaningful way, but under some conditions it rep- resents me. Language allows humans to understand things  in the world, even if that understanding is merely a simpli- fied representation of those things.  There are many kinds of maps: road maps, topographi- cal maps, nautical charts, star maps; the list goes on and  on. Different kinds of maps serve different functions, and  they’re not interchangeable: a nautical chart is well-nigh  useless  when  planning  a  driving  trip.  So  what  do  all  of  these different things called “map” have in common? Just  this:  they  boil  down  the  richness  and  complexity  of  the  physical world to just the details that one needs in a par- ticular situation. When you are driving, you need to know  what roads go where and how they intersect, which roads  are one-way, and how to get on the highway, and you prob- ably don’t need topographic information, or depth sound- ings. The map is not the territory because the map is both  a separate object from the territory, and much simpler.  Similarly metadata is a map. Metadata is a means by  which the complexity of an object is represented in a sim- pler form. The author of the novel Moby Dick is Herman  Melville, it’s about whaling, the original date of publica- tion is 1851. This is a very thin representation of a lengthy  and complex book. But it’s probably enough to enable you  to locate a copy of it, if you wished to do so.     IntroductIon      11  10237.indb   11  9 25 15   10:41 AM      Metadata is a map.  Metadata is a means by  which the complexity of  an object is represented  in a simpler form.  12     chaPter 1  10237.indb   12  9 25 15   10:41 AM   A roomful of books is not a library. In order to find  a  specific  book  in  a  library,  one  would  not  simply  walk  around and hope to spot it. Even a small library is too large  an information space for that to be practical. Instead, li- braries make use of a metaphorical map: the catalog. The  catalog provides the library user with a simplified repre- sentation of the materials in the library collection. Within  the catalog, the library user finds the record for the specific  item she wants. The catalog record then provides the user  with a critical piece of metadata: the call number. The call  number corresponds to a location in the information space  of the library, which enables the user to move from the re- cord to the actual object described by the record.  Why store data about an object, when you have the  object itself? Because without data about the objects con- tained in a space, any sufficiently complex space is indis- tinguishable from chaos. Even when an object is contained  within a space, if you want to find it again in a timely fash- ion, you need metadata about it. If you have ever lost your  keys in your own house, you understand how useful even a  single piece of metadata can be.  Metadata, not Just for Libraries Anymore  Librarians have been in the business of describing things  for more than 2,000 years, and have inevitably learned a      IntroductIon      13  10237.indb   13  9 25 15   10:41 AM   thing or two. The discipline of Library Science has given  the rest of the world a lot of insight into how to describe  things effectively.  Thanks largely to librarians working out principles of  description, it is now possible for anyone to apply those  principles to anything that needs to be described. Further- more, once the database was invented and it became pos- sible to store structured data, it also became possible for  anyone to create and maintain metadata electronically.  While  libraries  were  early  adopters  of  computer  and  database technologies, they were far from the only adopt- ers. Prior to the development of the minicomputer, library  metadata was stored in specialized and custom-built reposi- tories, such as shelf lists and card catalogs. After the devel- opment of the minicomputer, library metadata was stored  using the same technologies that everyone else was using.  With the advent of the database, it became possible to  create and store structured data about anything, not just  descriptive metadata about resources in library collections.  Of course, businesses and governments, in particular, have  always collected and stored structured data for more than  descriptive purposes: ledgers of profit and loss, invento- ries, tax documents, censuses, and the like, have existed  on paper—and even earlier technologies—for millennia.  But  these  were  never  considered  to  be  metadata;  these  were simply the documents generated by and that made  possible the daily operations of businesses, governments,   14     chaPter 1  10237.indb   14  9 25 15   10:41 AM   and other organizations. As these operations came to be  performed using computers, however, it became possible  not only to reference an object from a document about it   which, of course, you can do in a paper document, or even  on a cuneiform tablet , it became possible to provide an  actual link to that object in a file system. This functionality  is so ingrained in modern life, as the web is so ingrained in  modern life, that it’s difficult to convey how radically this  changed the way in which documents are managed.  What’s It All For?  You’re so conditioned to metadata being part of your ev- eryday  environment  that  you  don’t  even  think  about  it.  Maps,  signs,  dashboards,  web  searches,  ATMs,  grocery  stores, phone calls, the list could go on indefinitely. Meta- data is central to how all of these things operate, and to  how you interact with them. For most of us, it would be  undesirable to have access to the full complexity of a bank- ing system or the telephone network. Interacting with the  complex systems of modern life requires a simplified inter- face between the system and us, and that interface usually  relies on metadata.  This  is  particularly  true  where  information  systems  are concerned. Prior to the advent of the web, if you were  interested in, say, the life of Herman Melville—I heard he      IntroductIon      15  10237.indb   15  9 25 15   10:41 AM   sailed on a whaling ship, is that true?—you needed to ei- ther own a copy of a biography of the man, or get one from  a library. The same can be said for almost any information  object. Nowadays, however, information objects are just a  web search away. And doing a web search will fetch you more  information objects than you want. A search for “Herman  Melville biography” gets me hundreds of thousands of re- sults, which is more than I can process in my lifetime.  The term for this in information science jargon is “re- source discovery.” Resource discovery is, as you might ex- pect, the process of identifying information resources that  might be relevant to my information need—in this case,  information about the life of Herman Melville.  The idea of relevance is slippery though, as it’s highly  subjective: what’s relevant to you, what information ful- fills your information need, may not be the same as what’s  relevant  to  me,  even  if  the  questions  that  we  articulate  are similar. For example, I may be interested in knowing  if Melville sailed on a whaling ship, you may be interested  in whether he has any living heirs, but both of us might  conduct  a  web  search  for  “Herman  Melville  biography.”  Whether or not a specific information resource is relevant  is  a  subjective  judgment  call,  and  therefore  can  only  be  made by an individual after having processed that infor- mation resource.  In general, however, metadata is not used to capture  subjective interpretations of resources such as relevance,   16     chaPter 1  10237.indb   16  9 25 15   10:41 AM   but rather to capture objective features of resources such as  descriptions. Resource discovery relies on good metadata  like this. If you were to go to a library to find a biography  of Herman Melville, the success of your search  assuming  that such a book exists in your local library  depends on  the records for one or more resources containing the text  “Herman Melville” in the subject field, and some indica- tion that a book is a biography. To use our map metaphor:  the simplified representations of information objects that  are  contained  in  the  catalog  must  include  data  that  will  help you discover resources that you might find relevant.  This  type  of  metadata  is  called  descriptive  metadata.  This is exactly what it sounds like: metadata that provides  a description of an object. In this book thus far, descriptive  metadata is the only type of metadata that has been dis- cussed, but it is not the only type there is. In fact there are  several  categories  of  metadata.  Administrative  metadata  provides  information  about  the  origin  and  maintenance  of an object: for example, a photograph might have been  digitized  using  a  specific  type  of  scanner  at  a  particular  resolution, and might have some copyright restrictions as- sociated with it. Structural metadata provides information  about how an object is organized: for example, a book is  composed of chapters, a chapter is composed of pages, and  those chapters and pages must be put together in a par- ticular order. Preservation metadata provides information  necessary to support the process of preserving an object:      IntroductIon      17  10237.indb   17  9 25 15   10:41 AM   for example, it may be necessary to emulate a specific ap- plication and operating system environment in order to in- teract with a digital file. Both structural and preservation  metadata  are  sometimes  considered  to  be  subcategories  of  administrative  metadata,  as  data  about  the  structure  of an object and how to preserve it are both necessary to  administer the object. Finally, use metadata provides infor- mation about how an object has been used: for example,  the publisher of an electronic book might track how many  downloads the book has received, on what dates, and pro- file data about the users who downloaded it.  All  of  these  flavors  of  metadata  will  be  explored  in  more depth as this book progresses. But first the termi- nology that will be used throughout the rest of this book  will be defined.  18     chaPter 1  10237.indb   18  9 25 15   10:41 AM   2  definitions  chaPter 2  Information science, like any discipline, has its share of jar- gon terms. The word “metadata” is one of these, though it  has crept into more common usage in the past few years.  To investigate metadata, as this book does, inevitably also  means to encounter other jargon terms. In this chapter we  will explore these terms, and define them as best as possible. The most common—and perhaps least useful—defi- nition of metadata is that it is “data about data.” As catchy  as this definition is, however, it is entirely ambiguous. First  of all, what is data? And second, what does “about” mean?  Information We Have Lost in Data  We will start by trying to understand what data is. This is,  unfortunately, leaping into the deep end of the pool: data is  such a nebulous concept that even information scientists,   10237.indb   19  9 25 15   10:41 AM   who have devoted their entire careers to this phenomenon,  don’t always agree.  T. S. Eliot’s poem The Rock is a favorite among infor-  mation scientists, for the following two lines:  Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?  Eliot seems to posit a hierarchy: wisdom, knowledge, and  information,  in  order  of  decreasing  desirability.  Informa- tion  scientists  tend  not  to  feel  quite  so  negatively  about  information, but we do often make use of this same hierar- chy—though with the addition of data below information.  This hierarchy—data, information, knowledge, wisdom— is  invoked  to  explain  levels  of  informativeness,  or  stages  of information in the realm of human cognition. Data, ac- cording to this view, is the raw stuff: what is collected by  instrumentation or machinery. The stream of bits sent to  Earth by a Mars Rover, for example, is data. The signal car- ried by radio frequencies between your phone and the local  cell tower is data. Information, then, is data that has been  processed into a form that may be consumed by a human  being: that stream of bits converted to an image, for exam- ple, or that signal modulated into sound. This is slippery  ground, however: there’s a philosophical debate to be had  about whether something is information if it has only the  potential to inform someone, or if it has to actually inform   20     chaPter 2  10237.indb   20  9 25 15   10:41 AM   someone.  If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around,  does it generate information?  But we will ignore that issue  here, and refer the reader to the Further Readings section,  for some articles that deal with this issue. Knowledge, then,  is what you know, information that you have internalized.  Wisdom is knowing what to do with that knowledge.  Data  is  stuff.  It  is  raw,  unprocessed,  possibly  even  untouched  by  human  hands,  unviewed  by  human  eyes,  un-thought-about  by  human  minds.  We’re  not  used  to  thinking of information objects in this way: we’re used to  thinking  of  information  objects  as  things  like  books,  or  files on our computer, things that have been deliberately  created by humans, and where human understanding is an  integral part of their creation. However, think about the  stream of bits sent to Earth by the Mars Rover, or a book  in, for example, Lushootseed  or some other language that  you neither speak nor read… and apologies if you actually  do know Lushootseed : you may know that a stream of bits  or a book in Lushootseed has some meaning embedded in  it, but without some processing, that meaning is not ac- cessible to you. Data is potential information, analogous to  potential energy: work is required to release it.  Books are used as examples throughout this book, for  the simple reason that they are well understood: chances  are that if you’re reading this book, you’re familiar with the  technology  of  books  in  general.  The  problem  with  using  books as an example is that strictly speaking, a book is not      defInItIons      21  10237.indb   21  9 25 15   10:41 AM   data: a book is a container for data but is not the data itself.  A book is fundamentally a lump of processed wood; the data  are the words contained inside it. The words are the wine;  the book is the bottle.  You could even go a step further and  argue that the words are also a bottle and the wine is the  ideas.   This  container  metaphor  will  serve  us  well,  since  almost  everything  that  will  be  discussed  throughout  this  book is a bottle, not wine. Metadata is data, but metadata  cannot exist outside of a container: a metadata record must  exist in some format, be it physical or digital. Likewise a  metadata record is itself a container for data about an ob- ject. And that object may itself be a container for data, in the  case of that object being a book or other information object.  And so again, we’re faced with the difficulty of differentiat- ing between data and information… and again, we’re going  to ignore that issue. It is sufficient for our purposes to ac- knowledge that a metadata record is a container.  Describing Description  Let us now move on to the concept of aboutness. The word  “about” is so commonplace that spending any time defin- ing it seems as hairsplitting as debating what the meaning  of the word “is” is. But there is a lot of debate about “about.” The word “about” indicates description. But that just  pushes  the  inevitable  question  back:  instead  of  asking   22     chaPter 2  10237.indb   22  9 25 15   10:41 AM   what “about” means, now we’re asking what “description”  means. Unfortunately it’s difficult to define “description”  without  being  circular;  even  some  dictionaries  define  “description” as “describing something.” Fortunately, the  commonsense definition is the right one here: a descrip- tion tells you something about the thing being described.  A description is a statement about a thing, providing some  information about that thing. A description sets the de- scribed thing apart from all the other things that exist in  the universe, to help you identify the described thing later.  For example, the title of this book is Metadata. The author  of this book’s name is Pomerantz. This book has nineteen  figures, et cetera.  Data such as name, or title, or page length, these are  all  relatively  uncontroversial.  To  be  sure,  names  are  ar- bitrary… but once a name is given, it generally does not  change. More controversial is subject. The subject of a book   or other creative work  is often a matter of interpretation.  For example, what is this book about? I think we can all  agree that it’s about metadata. So one term that might be  used to describe the subject of this book is “metadata.” But  what else is this book about? Is it about the semantic web?  One chapter deals with that subject; is that enough to jus- tify using that term to describe the subject of the entire  book? The theme of networks runs throughout much of  this book, though little space is dedicated to discussing it      defInItIons      23  10237.indb   23  9 25 15   10:41 AM   explicitly; is that enough to justify using that term to de- scribe the subject of this book?  The  process  of  asking  and  answering  questions  like  these  is  referred  to  as  subject  analysis.  Which  is  exactly  what it sounds like: analyzing an object  such as a book   to identify what its subject is… what it is about. Obviously  not everything has a subject: naturally occurring objects,  for example, can’t really be said to have a subject. What is  Mount Rainier about? It’s a meaningless question. Simi- larly some pieces of art don’t have a subject—though, to  be  fair,  some  do.  The  fourth  movement  of  Beethoven’s  Symphony No. 9  usually referred to as the “Ode to Joy”   is about friendship and the brotherhood of all humankind,  but what are the first three movements about? Again, it’s  a meaningless question. Furthermore, even when objects  can be said to be about something, subject analysis is often  a matter of interpretation. What is the novel Moby Dick  about? On the one hand, it’s about a whale and whaling. On  the other hand, it’s about revenge and obsession. Which of  these interpretations justifies assigning subject terms?  The answer, unsurprisingly, is “it depends.” It depends  on  what  you’re  trying  to  accomplish  with  your  subject  terms. Flip to the back of this book, and you will find sev- eral pages of index. An index is a list of words, names, and  concepts that can be found in the text of this book, and the  pages on which they can be found. These index terms were  selected by a professional indexer to help you, the reader,   24     chaPter 2  10237.indb   24  9 25 15   10:41 AM   easily find concepts in the pages of this book. Now flip to  the front of this book, and look on the page after the title  page. You will see a bunch of information about copyright  and the publisher, and at the bottom of the page you will  see some numbered terms. In the jargon of librarianship,  these are what are called subject headings, and they describe  what this book is about.  This description is necessarily  at a very high level, since only a few subject headings are  assigned for even the longest book.  These subject head- ings were selected by a professional cataloger to help the  potential reader who is interested in books on this subject,  find  this  particular  book.  Both  index  terms  and  subject  headings were selected by human beings, to help other hu- man beings accomplish specific types of tasks. But given  the differences in these types of tasks, the terms that are  considered useful are different.  The difference in the terms employed as subject head- ings versus in an index begs the question: Where do these  descriptive terms come from? Do the indexer and the cata- loger just make them up? Do they select them from some  menu of terms? You may have already guessed the answer:  the indexer, on the one hand, makes up terms, though gen- erally these terms are selected from the words and con- cepts used by the author. The cataloger, on the other hand,  selects terms from a large, but finite set of available terms.  The nature of that set of available terms will be discussed  further, below.     defInItIons      25  10237.indb   25  9 25 15   10:41 AM   A Definition of Metadata  Now hopefully you can see why “data about data” is not a  useful definition of metadata. Data is only potential infor- mation, raw and unprocessed, prior to anyone actually being  informed by it. Determining what something is about is sub- jective, dependent on an understanding of that thing, as well  as dependent on the available terms. Thus, not only is this  definition of metadata not useful, it’s almost meaningless.  This definition can be salvaged only if we understand  the  word  “data”  to  mean  “potential  information,”  as  dis- cussed above. Data must be understood not as an abstract  concept but as objects that are potentially informative. Then  metadata can be defined as “a potentially informative object  that describes another potentially informative object.” This  is better, but somewhat clunky. Or, since a description is a  statement about something, we can define metadata as a  statement about a potentially informative object. And while  not perfect, this is the definition that we will stick with for  this book:  Metadata Is a Statement about a Potentially Informative  Object  As you’ll see throughout the course of this book, this defi- nition  is  useful  in  several  ways.  Specifically,  it  provides   26     chaPter 2  10237.indb   26  9 25 15   10:41 AM   latitude along several dimensions that we’ll be grateful for  later: first, as to the nature of the object; second, as to the  nature of the statement, and how that statement is made.  The Resource  Making a statement implies that we have  1  something to  make a statement about and  2  something to say about  it. Our “potentially informative object” is the something  about  which  we  are  making  a  statement.  This  object  is  more commonly referred to as a resource. The description,  then, is what we are saying about the resource.  A statement has 3 parts: First, we have the subject of  our description, the resource: for example, the Mona Lisa.  Second,  we  have  a  category  of  relationship  between  the  resource and some other thing  called a predicate : for ex- ample, that the resource has a creator. Finally, we have an- other object that has the predicated relationship with the  resource: for example, Leonardo da Vinci.  Please  note  that—confusingly—the  way  that  the  terms  “subject”  and  “object”  are  used  in  the  context  of   Subject   Mona Lisa   Predicate   Creator   Object   da Vinci   Figure 2     defInItIons      27  10237.indb   27  9 25 15   10:41 AM   metadata is exactly the opposite of how they are used in  the context of grammar. In grammar, the object of a sen- tence is the entity that is acted upon by the subject: for  example, in the sentence “Leonardo da Vinci painted the  Mona Lisa,” Leonardo da Vinci is the subject and Mona Lisa is  the object. In a descriptive metadata statement, however,  these terms are defined very differently: the subject is the  entity being described, and the object is another entity be- ing used to describe the subject. This will be revisited in  chapter 6, when we will discuss the Resource Description  Framework, which is the data model according to which  most metadata is currently structured.  Schemas, Elements, and Values  A  metadata  schema  is  a  set  of  rules  about  what  sorts  of  subject-predicate-object statements  called triples  one is  allowed to make, and how one is allowed to make them.  Imagine that you are filling out a form: for a job ap- plication or at a doctor’s office, for example. Forms have  fill-in-the-blank spaces, which require you to write specific  information  in  those  spaces:  the  date,  your  name,  your  phone number, etc. Sometimes a form even specifies the  format in which you should provide specific information:  dates must be written as MM DD YYYY, for example. The  form dictates the data that you are supposed to provide  and how you are supposed to provide it.  28     chaPter 2  10237.indb   28  9 25 15   10:41 AM   A fill-in-the-blank form is not a metadata schema, but  it makes for a decent analogy: one can think of a meta- data schema as defining the blanks on a form. In the next  chapter we will discuss Dublin Core, which is a metadata  schema designed to enable description of any resource. A  very simple Dublin Core record about the Mona Lisa might  look like this:  Title: Mona Lisa  Creator: Leonardo da Vinci  Date: 1503–1506  In this example, title, creator, and date are the blanks that  are filled in. These “blanks” are the predicates in subject- predicate-object  triples:  for  example,  Leonardo  da  Vinci   object  is the creator  predicate  of the Mona Lisa  sub- ject . By defining a small set of predicates, Dublin Core has  restricted the set of statements that one is allowed to make  about  a  resource.  In  the  context  of  a  metadata  schema,  however, these predicates are usually called elements.  An  element  in  a  metadata  schema  is  a  category  of  statement that can be made about a resource; an element  names an attribute of a resource. A value, then, is the data  that is assigned to an element: “Leonardo da Vinci” is the  creator of this resource, or “1503–1506” was the date of      defInItIons      29  10237.indb   29  9 25 15   10:41 AM   creation of this resource, for example. Together, you have  an element-value pair, which is the totality of a single state- ment about a resource. If metadata is statements about a  potentially  informative  object,  the  element-value  pair  is  the irreducible particle of metadata.  By  defining  metadata  as  statements,  a  metaphor  of  language is clearly being invoked. It’s an imperfect meta- phor, and only one specific philosophy of language is being  invoked—of language being a formal system of symbols— but it’s a useful metaphor for our purposes.  A  metadata  schema,  according  to  this  metaphor,  is  the set of rules according to which a language operates. A  metadata schema is therefore a very simple language, with  a small number of rules.  Encoding Schemes  The rules of a language, no matter how simple, apply to  a set of symbols that are used to convey meaning. Here  we get into semiotics  where instead of “symbol,” the term  “sign” is used : a sign conveys meaning by signifying, or  referring to, a signified. The set of letters “Jeffrey,” for ex- ample, signifies me. The set of letters “Jeffrey” is not me,  but under some conditions it is a sign that represents me.  I am the signified; “Jeffrey” is the signifier.  30     chaPter 2  10237.indb   30  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Metadata  schemas  exert  control  over  the  kinds  of  statements that may be made. Metadata encoding schemes  exert control over the way the signifiers used in those state- ments may be constructed. Encoding schemes are agnostic  as to what types of things may be signified. What encoding  schemes do is dictate how signifiers are constructed.  There  are  two  ways  in  which  signifiers  may  be  con- structed,  in  the  context  of  metadata…  two  types  of  en- coding schemes: for specifying syntax, and for specifying  vocabulary.  Signifier Type 1: Syntax Encoding  A  syntax  encoding  scheme  is  a  set  of  rules  that  dictate  how to represent, or encode, a specific type of data. Im- portantly, a syntax encoding scheme is specific to an indi- vidual metadata element.  For  example,  many  metadata  schemas  recommend  that  when  specifying  dates,  values  should  be  encoded   Table 2  Metadata schema controls this Title: Creator: Date: Format:  Encoding scheme controls this Mona Lisa Leonardo, da Vinci, 1452–1519 1503–1506 Poplar  wood      defInItIons      31  10237.indb   31  9 25 15   10:41 AM   according to the ISO 8601 standard. ISO 8601 is a stan- dard  of  the  International  Organization  for  Standardiza- tion, for representing dates and times. Let us take, as an  example, the date 14 March 2015, which is of course Pi  Day  3 14, in the month day notation used in the United  States . On that day, for one second, the date and time will  be the first 10 digits of Pi: 3 14 15, 9:26:53. This date and  time, encoded in ISO 8601, looks like this:  Date: 2015–03–14T09:26:53  ISO 8601 is a syntax encoding scheme, which means  that it provides a standard for how to represent a specific  type of data. A date may be an attribute of a resource  for  example, of its creation ; this encoding scheme is used to  provide a standard for how dates are represented in meta- data records. A syntax encoding scheme dictates a set of  rules for how to construct a signifier to indicate a specific  type of signified.  Signifier Type 2: Controlled Vocabulary  Like a syntax encoding scheme, a controlled vocabulary is a  set of rules that dictate how to represent a specific type of  data, and also is specific to an individual metadata element.  The difference, however, is this: while a syntax encoding   32     chaPter 2  10237.indb   32  9 25 15   10:41 AM   scheme dictates how a string describing a resource must  be formatted, a controlled vocabulary provides a finite set  of strings that may be used at all. Returning to our lan- guage metaphor, if a metadata schema exerts control over  the kinds of statements that may be made, a controlled  vocabulary exerts control over the words and phrases that  may be used in those statements.  For example, the recommendation for the subject ele- ment in Dublin Core is that values be selected from a con- trolled vocabulary. One of the most widely used controlled  vocabularies is the Library of Congress Subject Headings— which is, as you might expect, maintained by the Library of  Congress. Subject headings from the LCSH have been used  in every book published in the United States since the early  1970s. In fact subject headings from LCSH are used in this  very book: take a look at the copyright page of this book   on the fourth page, opposite the dedication .  One of the LCSH terms used for this book is “meta- data.” What puts the control in controlled vocabulary is this:  the term is “metadata,” and not anything else. If you want  to adhere to LCSH, you could not describe this book as be- ing about “meta-data,” or “data about data,” or any other  synonym. The term is “metadata,” and “metadata” is the  only acceptable term.  A controlled vocabulary is, in a sense, like Newspeak,  the language from the novel 1984. Newspeak is an artifi- cial language, in which the number of available words has      defInItIons      33  10237.indb   33  9 25 15   10:41 AM   been  dramatically  limited,  all  synonyms  and  antonyms  have been eliminated, and the scope of the meanings of  those words that remain have been clarified and simpli- fied. Replace “Newspeak” with “a controlled vocabulary,”  and the previous sentence remains accurate. Of course, it  is not a thoughtcrime against the Library of Congress to  use a term that is not in LCSH to describe a resource… but  it would violate the practice of adhering to the standard in  the first place.  The Library of Congress Subject Headings is, of course,  only one controlled vocabulary out of many. But the LCSH  is the granddaddy of controlled vocabularies: it’s one of the  oldest still in widespread use, having been developed at the  Library of Congress in 1898, and one of the broadest, as it  attempts to cover the entire range of human knowledge.  Attempting to cover the entire range of human knowl- edge, unfortunately, runs up against a rather large onto- logical problem. The universe is a big place, and there is,  arguably, an infinite number of possible subjects in it. A  controlled vocabulary, however, is by definition a finite set  of terms. How can a controlled vocabulary possibly hope to  be able to represent all possible subjects?  To be fair, the LCSH is enormous. As of this writing the  most recent edition is the 35th, which is published in 6 vol- umes, weighs in at 6,845 pages, and contains over 300,000  subject headings.  As an aside, the 35th edition will be the  final print edition, as the Library of Congress is transition- ing to online-only publication.  In fact, though, the figure   34     chaPter 2  10237.indb   34  9 25 15   10:41 AM   of  300,000  is  misleading:  LCSH  contains  rules  to  allow  you to string subject headings together, to create what are  called subdivisions. You could, for example, describe a work  about the ferries that existed in Seattle at the time of the  Great Fire as follows, using both geographic and chrono- logical subdivisions:  Ferries—Washington—Seattle—1889  By remixing subject headings in this way, LCSH allows  for a potentially infinite number of terms to emerge, out  of what is otherwise a finite set.  Name Authority  Related to the controlled vocabulary is the authority file.  Like a controlled vocabulary, an authority file provides a  finite set of strings that may be used to describe a resource.  A name authority file, then, is specific to names.  The Library of Congress, again, maintains one of the  most widely used name authority files: the Library of Con- gress  Name  Authority  File   LCNAF ,  which  provides  au- thoritative name data for people, places, and things. The  LCNAF entry for Mark Twain, for example, is as follows:  Twain, Mark, 1835–1910     defInItIons      35  10237.indb   35  9 25 15   10:41 AM   As  with  a  controlled  vocabulary,  this  string  is  the  only acceptable term for referring to Mark Twain. Samuel  Langhorne Clemens wrote under several pseudonyms, but  if you are using the LCNAF as the source of values for a  metadata element, there is only one valid way to refer to  him. Indeed the LCNAF entry for “Clemens, Samuel Lang- horne,  1835–1910”  contains  this  note:  “This  heading  is  not valid for use as a subject. Works about this person are  entered under Twain, Mark, 1835–1910.” An authority file  is a harsh mistress: it is very particular about what terms  you are allowed to use, and issues a stern correction if you  even consider using the wrong one.  While the LCNAF is one of the broadest authority files,  it is far from the only one. The J. Paul Getty Research In- stitute has created two name authority files: the Cultural  Objects Name Authority  CONA ®, which provides titles  and other information about art objects, and the Union  List of Artist Names  ULAN ®, which provides authorita- tive name data and associated information about artists  and groups of artists. The ULAN entry for Mark Twain is  slightly different than the LCNAF entry:  Twain, Mark  pseudonym   Many  other  authority  files  exist.  Authority  files  are  often created by national libraries, which is only natural as  national libraries generally have as their scope all materi- als published in, or relevant to, that nation.  As an aside,   36     chaPter 2  10237.indb   36  9 25 15   10:41 AM   the Library of Congress is not actually a national library, it  is Congress’ library, though it serves as a de facto national  library.  That large a scope, of course, inevitably ends up  overlapping with the scope of other national libraries: how  could the Library of Congress collect material on US his- tory, for example, without duplicating materials also col- lected by European national libraries? And we’ve already  seen that the authority files created by the Library of Con- gress and the Getty Research Institute overlap.  In order to minimize this sort of wheel-reinvention,  and to the reduce the costs of maintaining authority files  by  spreading  the  work  around,  the  Library  of  Congress,  the German and French National Libraries  the Deutsche  Nationalbibliothek  and  the  Bibliothèque  Nationale  de  France , and OCLC  an organization that will be discussed  further in the next chapter  launched a project called the  Virtual International Authority File  VIAF . VIAF has since  grown to become a partnership of, as of this writing, 22  institutions from all over the world  including the Getty as  the only contributor that is not a national library . VIAF is  an uber-authority file, combining records from all partici- pants into a single service, shared globally.  Thesaurus  Let us now back up slightly, to controlled vocabularies. A  controlled vocabulary, like Newspeak, is a restricted set of      defInItIons      37  10237.indb   37  9 25 15   10:41 AM   terms that are allowable for use. But such a set of terms  may simply be a list.  A thesaurus builds on the simplicity of the list, add- ing structure and hierarchy to the set of terms. This struc- ture is not a grammar, however. A language is both a set of  words and the grammatical rules that govern how those  words may be strung together to form coherent sentences.   Of course, both the set of words in and the grammatical  rules of a language evolve over time, but that’s neither here  nor there.  The grammatical rules of a language are a struc- ture, to be sure, but of a different kind than the structure  of a thesaurus. A thesaurus does not govern how words  may or may not be used; a thesaurus governs the relation- ships among words.  Let’s return to our Seattle ferries example. A controlled  vocabulary might articulate, say, the set of allowable terms  to refer to places in the United States: perhaps the 29,514  “incorporated places and census designated places” recog- nized in the 2010 US Census. But that would just be a list  of terms.  A thesaurus would include the relationships between  the entities named using these terms: Seattle would be a  “child”  of  Washington,  as  would  Olympia,  Spokane,  Walla  Walla, and all of the other identifiable places within Wash- ington state. Each of the 50 states would similarly have  its list of child entities. This hypothetical thesaurus would  only  be  two  layers  deep,  but  you  could  easily  imagine  a   38     chaPter 2  10237.indb   38  9 25 15   10:41 AM   thesaurus that has many layers. Cities might have neigh- borhoods as child entities, which in turn might have streets  as children. Instead of states, cities might have counties as  their parents, the parents of counties would be states, then  nations, then continents. In fact this is exactly how the J.  Paul Getty Research Institute’s Thesaurus of Geographic  Names® is organized.  Washington  is  a  classic  example  of  why  thesauri  are  useful.  There  are  many  Washingtons  throughout  the  United States: the state of Washington, the US capitol city  of Washington, a Washington county in no less than 30  different states of the Union, a city or town named Wash- ington in at least 25 different states, and a host of other  Washingtons besides. But it’s a simple matter to represent  this diversity of Washingtons in a thesaurus, since each  one occupies a unique place in the hierarchy: there can be   Figure 3     defInItIons      39  10237.indb   39  9 25 15   10:41 AM   no  confusing  Washington  county,  North  Carolina  with  Washington  county,  Maine,  because  each  Washington  county has a different parent.  The type of thesaurus under discussion here is some- what  different  than  the  common  meaning  of  the  term  “thesaurus.” One of the most popular thesauri in the Eng- lish  language  is  Roget’s Thesaurus,  which  is  a  book   now  also online, of course  that lists words, and provides syn- onyms and antonyms for each word. If we were to search  for the word “control” in Roget’s Thesaurus, for example,  we would find that some of its synonyms are “regulation”  and “restraint,” while some of its antonyms are “chaos” and  “lawlessness.”  Roget’s Thesaurus  like any thesaurus of a language  pro- vides a set of words and their relationships. The relation- ships, however, are very simple: synonymy and antonymy.  These relationships are made somewhat more complicated  when you consider that most words have shades of mean- ing  “regulation” and “restraint” are not themselves truly  synonyms,  but  both  are  synonyms  of  “control” .  Every  meaning of a word may therefore be treated as a separate  entity, each with its own synonyms and antonyms.  Con- sider, for example, the word “blue,” which has at least two  separate meanings, the color and the mood.  This is in fact  how WordNet is structured: WordNet is a lexical database  of English that’s widely used in information science and  computer science. All that aside, however, in a language   40     chaPter 2  10237.indb   40  9 25 15   10:41 AM   thesaurus there are two and only two relationships  syn- onymy  and  antonymy   regardless  of  how  the  thesaurus  defines what a word is.  A thesaurus in the information science sense—that is,  a thesaurus that provides values for metadata elements— might  have  different,  and  sometimes  more  complex,  re- lationships between terms. Returning once again to our  ferries example, LCSH uses “broader terms” and “narrower  terms” to indicate hierarchical relationships. For example,  “passenger ships” is a broader term than “ferries,” and “wa- ter taxis” is a narrower term. Thus “ferries” is a subcategory  of “passenger ships,” and “water taxis” is a subcategory of  “ferries.” The relationship between terms here is IS A. In  mathematical terms, this is an asymmetric transitive rela- tion: if a water taxi is a ferry, then a ferry is not a water taxi   Y is a X, X is not a Y ; and if a ferry is a passenger ship,  then a water taxi is also a passenger ship  Z is a Y, Y is a X,  therefore Z is a X .  This  kind  of  hierarchical  structure  is  commonplace,  as it’s the same structure as a family tree: a parent may  have one or more children, who may in turn have one or  more children, etc. As in a family tree, too, entities may  have siblings, if a parent has more than one child. Thus  ferries, cargo ships, and ocean liners are siblings, as they are  all children  narrower terms  of passenger ships.  One further type of relationship is common in thesauri:  “use for.” The use of “use for” indicates that a specific term      defInItIons      41  10237.indb   41  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Ships  Hospital  ships  Minesweepers  Passenger  ships  Viking ships  Cruise ships  Ferries  Ocean liners  Team boats  Train ferries  Water taxis  Sea trains  Figure 4  is the preferred term, which should be used instead of any  specified alternative. In our Mark Twain example above,  it  was  pointed  out  that  the  LCNAF  entry  for  “Clemens,  Samuel  Langhorne,  1835–1910”  points  to  the  preferred  term “Twain, Mark, 1835–1910.” In the Getty Thesaurus  of Geographic Names®, for another example, there are sev- eral names listed for the city of Casablanca—Dar el Beida,  Ad-Dār Al-Bayḍā, Anfa—but “Casablanca” is listed as the  preferred term. The relationship between these entities is   42     chaPter 2  10237.indb   42  9 25 15   10:41 AM   a “use for” relationship: if you are using TGN, “Casablanca”  should be used instead of “Dar el Beida” or any other name.  A Very Brief Foray into Network Analysis  A hierarchical structure is only one type of topology for a  network. In mathematical terms, a network is a graph: a  set of entities connected by relationships. Many fields deal  with phenomena that form networks: computer networks,  biological networks, telecommunication networks, social  networks, and the like. Different fields use different terms  to refer to the objects and links in a network; we will use  the terms from graph theory and refer to these entities as  nodes, and the connections as edges.  Topology, as a branch of mathematics, is the study of  shapes and spaces, and what shapes are actually equiva- lent, in the sense that one may be deformed into the other   for example, a coffee mug may be deformed into a torus .  The topology of a network is the “shape” of the network,  in the sense of the structure created by the edges between  nodes. Some simple network topologies include a ring  in  which  one  node  is  connected  to  the  next,  which  is  con- nected to the next, etc., until the last node in the ring is  connected to the first , and a star  in which all nodes are  connected to one central node . A hierarchy, or family tree  arrangement of nodes, is a tree topology.     defInItIons      43  10237.indb   43  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Network analysis is a somewhat poorly defined term,  given how diverse the fields are in which networks are ap- plied. For our purposes, however, network analysis is the  use  of  networks  to  study  phenomena  that  may  be  more  complex than their component parts. The World Wide Web,  for example, is more than the sum of the servers that exist  in the world, and it exhibits behaviors that no individual  server exhibits. Similarly a social network is more than a set  of individuals who are acquainted with each other.  Thanks to Facebook and Twitter and other social net- working services—as well as news stories about the NSA  collecting  phone  records—social  network  analysis  has  become very well known in the past few years. But social  network analysis is only one type of network analysis: the  analysis of connections among people, as opposed to the  connections among computers, or neurons, or any of the  many other entities that form networks. In the social net- work as represented by Facebook, for example, the nodes  are people, places, and organizations, and the only relation- ships are “friend” and “likes.” Facebook’s social network is  fairly  flat:  people,  places,  and  organizations  are  all  very  broad  categories,  and  not  all  of  your  Facebook  “friends”  are actually your friends. There are a host of names for the  relationships that can exist among people: friend, acquain- tance, neighbor, coworker, colleague, sibling, spouse, em- ployer, employee, enemy, frenemy… the list goes on and  on. Furthermore not every entity in a network—even in a   44     chaPter 2  10237.indb   44  9 25 15   10:41 AM   social network—needs to be a person, place, or organiza- tion. For example, the NSA’s analyses of social networks  supposedly  include  such  entities  as  phone  numbers  and  email addresses.  Network analysis is a large and very interesting area  of study in its own right, and we cannot do it justice here.  Some books on various aspects of the topic are listed in the  Further Readings section.  Two nodes connected by an edge is the most basic unit  of  a  network;  this  three-part  relationship  was  discussed  above  as  the  subject-predicate-object  triple.  The  subject  and object of a metadata description are thus both nodes,  and the predicate is the edge.  In this example of a network, we very quickly move  from the Mona Lisa to Allentown, Pennsylvania, two enti- ties that usually have very little to do with one another.  As more and more entities and relationships are added, a  network grows rapidly. Indeed, as more and more entities  and  relationships  accumulate,  there’s  really  nowhere  to  stop, short of mapping out the network of relationships  between everything in the entire universe. Such mapping  is, in most cases, not feasible. We will return to mapping in  chapter 6, when we discuss linked data.  In short, a node in a network may be any type of en- tity, and an edge may be any type of relationship between  entities. The nature of the network  computer, social, neu- ral, etc.  naturally dictates both the type of entity and type      defInItIons      45  10237.indb   45  9 25 15   10:41 AM   1503–1506  Mona Lisa  del Giocondo,   Lisa, 1479–  da Vinci, Leonardo  1519  S  u  bject  Date  C re ato r  Born  Vinci  Sister city  Part of  Allentown  Firenze   province   of relationships that may exist in the network. However,  given  that  an  edge  may  be  any  type  of  relationship,  we  must discuss ontologies.  In philosophy, ontology is the study of the nature of real- ity and the categories of things that exist. In information  science, an ontology is a formal representation of the uni- verse of things that exist in a specific domain. What these   Figure 5  Ontology  46     chaPter 2  10237.indb   46  9 25 15   10:41 AM   two approaches to ontology share in common is that they  both articulate a universe of entities and relationships be- tween entities… even if it’s a small universe.  A  thesaurus  is  a  hierarchy,  but  one  in  which  the  re- lationships between entities are usually fairly simple, of- ten IS A: a water taxi is a ferry, a ferry is a passenger ship.  Other  common  relationships  in  thesauri  include  part  of   for example, Vinci is part of Firenze province, Firenze is  part of Tuscany , instance of  John Tyler is an instance of  President of the United States , and part-whole  the elbow  is part of the arm . However, in principle, the relationships  in a thesaurus may be anything at all.  An ontology builds on a thesaurus: an ontology is also  a set of entities and the relationships between them, it is  also organized as a hierarchy, it also often uses a controlled  vocabulary or other encoding scheme for naming entities  and relationships. In fact an ontology so closely resembles  a thesaurus that the two terms are often used interchange- ably, though it is incorrect to do so.  An ontology differs from a thesaurus in that an ontol- ogy includes a set of rules. As a straightforward hierarchical  structure, a family tree makes a good example. An entity in  a hierarchy may have children, and in a family tree this is  literally a parent–child relationship. There are in fact two  parent relations in a family tree, mother and father, and  two child relations, daughter and son. Knowing this, we  can create the following rules: if A is female, then A is the      defInItIons      47  10237.indb   47  9 25 15   10:41 AM   mother of B; or the inverse, if A is the mother of B, then A  is female. Female is a characteristic that may be assigned to  entities, and based on that characteristic an inference may  be made about relationships between that entity and other  entities. Or inversely, if we know the relationship between  two entities, an inference may be made about the charac- teristics of one of more of those entities. Inferences are a  layer on top of a thesaurus, a way to integrate knowledge  about the world into an ontology.  This knowledge about the world may be encoded as  rules for action, for example in software. For example, in a  genealogy application the following rules might exist: If B  is female, then the default relationship between B and any  child entities is mother, and a ♀ symbol should be drawn  next to B’s name.  Metadata Gone Wild!  From  encoding  schemes  to  thesauri  to  ontologies,  this  chapter  has  moved  from  less  to  increasingly  structured  and information-rich mechanisms for creating or selecting  values for elements in a metadata schema. This section,  however, moves to the extreme other end of the spectrum,  to a complete lack of structure.  In the novel 1984, Newspeak restricts the words that  even exist, on the premise that a limited vocabulary limits   48     chaPter 2  10237.indb   48  9 25 15   10:41 AM   the concepts that it’s possible to communicate, and even  to think. Like Newspeak, an encoding scheme controls the  terms that it’s possible to use—either by limiting the num- ber of allowable terms, as in a controlled vocabulary, or by  specifying the structure of terms, as in a syntax encoding  scheme.  The  premise  behind  encoding  schemes  is  that  natural language is often ambiguous, so control is neces- sary to limit the complexity of metadata records. This is  a top-down, command-and-control approach to metadata. What if, instead, one were to take a bottom-up, grass- roots approach to metadata? What if there were no control  over the terms that it’s possible to use? The beauty of the  Internet is that it is uncontrolled. Yes, there are organiza- tions in which certain functions are centralized, such as  assigning IP addresses and emergency response. But there  is no agency that dictates what kind of content you can  put online.  The  fact  that  the  Internet  is  largely  uncontrolled,  makes it rich soil for the uncontrolled vocabulary. Where a  controlled vocabulary provides a finite set of terms that  may used as values for a particular element in a metadata  schema, an uncontrolled vocabulary allows any term to be  used. And any term really does mean any: not only is the  entire range of words in your chosen language fair game,  but  an  uncontrolled  vocabulary  allows  terms  to  be  in- vented on the spot.     defInItIons      49  10237.indb   49  9 25 15   10:41 AM      What committee devel- oping a name authority  file for book titles could  have anticipated How   to Avoid Huge Ships, or  The Stray Shopping   Carts of Eastern North  America?  50     chaPter 2  10237.indb   50  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Some elements, of course, lend themselves naturally  to this lack of control. The Title element, for example, is  probably best uncontrolled, since it should be possible for  the creator of a resource to name it anything they want.  What committee developing a name authority file for book  titles could have anticipated How to Avoid Huge Ships, or  The Stray Shopping Carts of Eastern North America? Yet some  elements benefit dramatically from being controlled. The  Date element, for example, is probably best controlled, as  there are so many ways to write a date. A simple example of  this is the month-day-year format common in the United  States, versus the day-month-year common in Europe.  Between these two extremes, there are many elements  that can swing either way. Subject is perhaps the most no- table of these. As discussed above, Subject is host to per- haps the largest controlled vocabulary in existence, LCSH.  On  the  other  hand,  Subject  also  lends  itself  extremely  well to being uncontrolled. If you have ever created a blog  post, or uploaded a video to YouTube, or saved a book to  Goodreads, you know that you can assign any tags to it  that you want.  These tags serve a double purpose. For you, the user  of a service, these tags are a way of organizing your own  materials. You can create any tag you want, no matter how  idiosyncratic, so that you can search and browse and find  your own materials. If you want to use the tag “to read”  on a book in Goodreads, that’s fine, even if that book is on      defInItIons      51  10237.indb   51  9 25 15   10:41 AM   no one else in the world’s To Read list. If you want to use  the tag “turlingdrome” to describe a photo on Flickr, that’s  fine, even if you’re the only person in the entire world to  use that tag. Tags are individualized terms, and need only  be meaningful to their creator.  Nevertheless, it turns out that most users will use the  same  or  similar  tags  for  a  specific  piece  of  content.  For  example,  some  of  the  most  common  tags  in  Goodreads  for the book The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy are “sci- ence-fiction” and “humor.”  Goodreads calls tags “custom  shelves.”  By aggregating the tags used idiosyncratically by  thousands of independent users, Goodreads has accurately  surfaced the genres of this book. So if a future Goodreads  user goes searching for science fiction books to read, or hu- mor books, or humorous science fiction, she will find The  Hitchhiker’s Guide.  This is precisely what tags are good for: allowing users  to search or browse for content online, using terms that  reflect the way people actually think about searching and  browsing. The LCSH are terrific, but the subject headings  assigned to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy probably  do not reflect the way most people would search for that  book:  Prefect, Ford  Fictitious character —Fiction  Dent, Arthur  Fictitious character —Fiction  52     chaPter 2  10237.indb   52  9 25 15   10:41 AM   These subject headings are accurate, in the sense that these  two are characters in the book. But probably few people  would think to search for the book that way.  In addition to the tag “science-fiction” in Goodreads,  other  very  popular  tags  for  The  Hitchhiker’s  Guide  to  the  Galaxy include “sci-fi,” “scifi,” and “sf.” This variation re- opens the issue of the value of idiosyncrasy. If tags are sup- posed to be good for allowing searching and browsing in a  commonsensical way, doesn’t the existence of variant tags  interfere with that usefulness?  On the one hand, yes. If a user is browsing for “sf,” it’s  true  that  she  will  not  find  books  that  are  tagged  “scifi.”  On the other hand, if the number of tags is large enough,  chances are that there will be significant overlap: the same  books will be tagged “sf” by some users and “scifi” by oth- ers. So variability may reduce some of the usefulness of  tags, but not completely.  While most users will use the same or similar tags for  a specific piece of content, some users and some tags are  more idiosyncratic. One Goodreads user, for example, has  tagged The Hitchhiker’s Guide with “xxe” and another with  “box-8.”  What  do  those  tags  mean?  Who  cares!  The  tag  “xxe” isn’t wrong… it makes sense to someone, just not to  me. There is no such thing as a bad or a wrong tag: if a tag  is useful to even one person, then it’s a good tag… just one  that won’t be used a lot.     defInItIons      53  10237.indb   53  9 25 15   10:41 AM   And that is the fundamental difference between con- trolled  and  uncontrolled  vocabularies.  A  controlled  vo- cabulary provides a standardized set of terms to describe  some set of objects, while an uncontrolled vocabulary al- lows any and all terms to emerge. A controlled vocabulary  exerts control to restrict the range of options; an uncon- trolled vocabulary lets a hundred flowers bloom.  Of course, it’s human nature to want to simplify the  complexities of the reality around us. Thus communities  of users often arise around services that make use of tags,  dedicated to normalizing tagsets. This is very common in  Wikipedia, for example; there are entire groups dedicated  to  organizing  and  defining  the  scope  of  the  categories  within subject areas in Wikipedia. Thus there is constant  pressure  on  uncontrolled  vocabularies  toward  a  greater  degree of control. And, of course, even controlled vocabu- laries change over time, as new terms are created and ob- solete terms are dropped, in an effort to reflect changes  in the state of knowledge about the entities within their  scope. There is no such thing as a pure controlled or uncon- trolled vocabulary: all actual vocabularies are somewhere  along a spectrum of greater or lesser degrees of control.  The Record  54     chaPter 2  A metadata schema is a set of rules about what sorts of  subject-predicate-object statements are possible to make.   10237.indb   54  9 25 15   10:41 AM   An element is a category of statement that can be made  according to the schema, and a value is the data that is as- signed to an element, according to the schema’s rules for  that element. We have now concluded the lengthy section  of this chapter devoted to how to create or select values,  and we will move on to the metadata record.  A metadata record is simply a set of subject-predicate- object  statements  about  a  single  resource.  In  a  spread- sheet, a single row is an entry for a single entity, containing  all data about that entity, the categories of which are speci- fied in the column headers. Likewise a metadata record is  specific to a single resource  for example, the Mona Lisa ,  containing all metadata about that resource  Leonardo da  Vinci, 1503–1506, etc. , the categories of which are speci- fied by the elements in the schema  creator, date, etc. .  An important characteristic of metadata records is as  follows: There should be one and only one metadata record  for a single resource. This is, in fact, so important that it’s  known as the One-to-One Principle: one resource, one re- cord. This principle was originally articulated for Dublin  Core metadata records, but it is applicable outside of that  context as well.  In practical terms, the One-to-One Principle specifies  that there should be one and only one metadata record for  the Mona Lisa. This seems perfectly reasonable on the face  of it. But there are a great many works that are derived  from the Mona Lisa. No one is likely to argue that, for ex- ample,  Marcel  Duchamp’s  work  L.H.O.O.Q.  is  a  resource      defInItIons      55  10237.indb   55  9 25 15   10:41 AM   distinct  from  the  Mona  Lisa,  and  therefore  deserves  its  own metadata record. But what about, for example, a high- resolution digital photograph of the Mona Lisa, created and  maintained by the Louvre, and intended to be the defini- tive surrogate for the original? Should this be considered  to be a resource distinct from the Mona Lisa, with its own  metadata record? Yes, it should. A digital photograph of  the Mona Lisa is not the Mona Lisa.  Many metadata schemas include elements to deal with  situations such as this. Both Dublin Core and VRA Core  a  schema for describing works of visual culture, created by  the Visual Resources Association , for example, include el- ements named Relation, and the CDWA  the J. Paul Getty  Trust’s Categories for the Description of Works of Art  in- cludes an element named Related Works. The Louvre’s high- resolution digital photograph of the Mona Lisa is a resource  related  to  the  Mona  Lisa,  as  is  L.H.O.O.Q.  Both  of  those  resources might share an element-value pair in common,  indicating the relation to the Mona Lisa, establishing a re- lationship between those resources and the resource from  which they are derived. Thus the One-to-One Principle is  maintained: each resource has its own metadata record, but  an important relationship between resources is captured.  The One-to-One Principle has one significant short- coming,  however:  there  are  many  metadata  schemas  to  choose from. It is at this point that the One-to-One Prin- ciple breaks down.  56     chaPter 2  10237.indb   56  9 25 15   10:41 AM   In fact the One-to-One Principle could reasonably be  renamed the One-to-One-to-One Principle: there should  be one and only one metadata record for a single resource,  for a single metadata schema. The Mona Lisa, a digital pho- tograph of the Mona Lisa, and L.H.O.O.Q. all should have  unique  metadata  records  using  elements  from  Dublin  Core. But they might also all have unique metadata records  using elements from CDWA, and yet a third set of unique  records using elements from VRA Core.  Why one might want a DC record or a CDWA record or  a record in another metadata schema, for a particular re- source, depends on the use case. What are your resources?  Who are your users likely to be? What are they likely to  want to do with your metadata records? The pros and cons  of  different  metadata  element  sets,  and  possible  values  that can be assigned to elements, will be discussed in the  next several chapters.  Location of Metadata Records  There should be one and only one metadata record, in a sin- gle metadata schema, for a single resource. This, however,  begs the question: Where is this record? The answer is that  there are two places that a metadata record may be located:  inside and outside. That is, embedded within the resource  to which the record refers or separate from the resource.     defInItIons      57  10237.indb   57  9 25 15   10:41 AM   We’ve already seen examples of records in these two  locations: On the one hand, the Library of Congress Cata- loging  in  Publication  data,  subject  headings,  and  other  metadata  located  on  the  copyright  page  of  this  book,  is  a metadata record about this book embedded inside this  book. A card in a library catalog, on the other hand, is a  metadata record about this book  containing much of the  same information  that is a separate object from this book. In both the physical and the online worlds, inside and  outside  exhausts  the  universe  of  possibilities  for  where  something can be: a physical or a digital object can con- tain metadata about itself, or a metadata record may exist  separate from the object. This raises the question: Which is  preferable? The answer, unsurprisingly, is: It depends. For  the most part, it depends on what the use case is.  Metadata embedded in an object is generally produced  with the object. Consider schema.org, which will be dis- cussed further in chapter 7. Schema.org is a standard that  enables  structured  data  to  be  embedded  in  HTML  files,  which  are  otherwise  usually  unstructured.  This  internal  metadata is therefore likely to represent the authority of  the creator of the website. However, metadata embedded  in an object is likely to be difficult or impossible to change.  You, as a user, cannot change the markup in a webpage,  for example; only the website administrator can do that.  Internal metadata is authoritative but static.  58     chaPter 2  10237.indb   58  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Metadata external to an object may be produced with  the  object,  but  it  may  just  as  easily  be  created  after  the  fact. Consider a metadata record about a published article,  stored in a database. For example, I once discovered that  a journal article that I wrote was incorrectly attributed to  another author in an online database. In other words, the  metadata record about that article had been assigned the  incorrect value for the Author field. I contacted the data- base  vendor  and  they  corrected  the  record  within  hours.  This story ends happily for me, and reflects well on the da- tabase vendor. But metadata external to an object inevita- bly raises the question of who created that metadata, and  how  trustworthy  the  process  of  creation  is.  Furthermore  external metadata may be customized for specific use cases:  the metadata record created for a commercial database of  scholarly literature may be different than the record created  for Google Scholar, may be different than the record created  by a citation management application. External metadata is  flexible but may be of questionable authority.  With digital files, it can sometimes be difficult to iden- tify exactly where the metadata record about a resource  is located, and in fact the location of a record can change.  The  company  Gracenote  maintains  the  CDDB   Compact  Disc Database , which is, as the name indicates, a database  of descriptive metadata records about CDs and the music  files on them. The CDDB is online, and any licensed music  player application may access these records to display this      defInItIons      59  10237.indb   59  9 25 15   10:41 AM   metadata to the user of the application. In other words,  the CDDB is a collection of external metadata records. The  CDDB was originally developed because early CDs did not  contain any metadata about their contents; later the CD- Text specification was developed to store this metadata on  CDs. This CD-Text data, however, is stored in a different  location on the CD than the music files it describes. CD- Text records on a CD are therefore still external metadata  records, in the same sense that the metadata located on  the copyright page of a book is external to the actual con- tent of the book. When a CD is “ripped”  the files on it cop- ied  and  often  reformatted ,  however,  many  applications  also rip the CD-Text data for the audio files on the CD. In  other words, the CD-Text metadata for a digital audio file  is internal to the file.  If a metadata record is internal to an object, then it’s  obvious that the record describes that object. The meta- data on the copyright page of a book clearly describes that  specific book; the schema.org markup in a webpage clearly  refers  to  that  specific  webpage;  it  would  be  nonsensical  otherwise. But if a metadata record is external to the ob- ject that it describes, then how are those two things con- nected? How can we know where a metadata record for an  object is? Conversely, how can we know what object a re- cord refers to? The answer to this question is, quite simply:  More metadata.  A metadata record about a book will contain elements  such as the title and author. These two elements alone will   60     chaPter 2  10237.indb   60  9 25 15   10:41 AM   generally  be  enough  to  uniquely  identify  a  book:  there’s  more than one book in the world with the title Metadata,  but only one is by Jeffrey Pomerantz. Any additional meta- data that’s provided about a book is just icing, for the pur- poses of uniquely identifying a book: there’s certainly not  going to be more than one book titled Metadata, by Jeffrey  Pomerantz, published by MIT Press, in 2015.  Rather than rely on multiple elements in combination  to uniquely identify an object, however, it is often prefer- able to have a single element. For books in a library this is  the call number, for example Library of Congress Classifi- cation. Shortly after its publication this book, like all books  published in the United States, was assigned an LCC call  number. When this book is placed on a shelf in a library,  it will be placed according to its call number, which will— conveniently  for  library  users—put  it  near  other  books  on similar topics. Of course, LCC is only one system for  creating call numbers for books; another common scheme  is the Dewey Decimal Classification. And, of course, out- side of the context of libraries, publishers have yet another  scheme for uniquely identifying books: the International  Standard Book Number  ISBN .  This call number appears in metadata records that are  external to this book: in the library catalog record. But for  the call number to be useful, it must also exist internal to  the book itself. The call number of a book is printed with the  Cataloging in Publication data on the copyright page, and in  libraries it is often attached to the book spine as a sticker. In      defInItIons      61  10237.indb   61  9 25 15   10:41 AM   other words, the call number is added to the book as a piece  of internal metadata  even if it’s in fact on the outside of  the object . The existence of this piece of metadata allows  a librarian to know where to place the book on the shelves,  and a library user to know where to find it.  Thus, for external metadata records to be useful, they  must rely on the existence of internal metadata. So, if in- ternal metadata must necessarily exist, then why have ex- ternal metadata at all? This is because external metadata  saves the user’s time. One of the most important uses of  metadata, as discussed in chapter 1, is resource discovery.  External metadata is far more useful for resource discovery  than internal metadata: a library catalog is much smaller  and easier to search than an entire library.  Unique Identifiers  A unique identifier is exactly what it sounds like: something  that  identifies  an  entity  uniquely,  without  any  confusion  with other entities. Usually a unique identifier is a name or  an address. And in fact, when discussing unique identifiers,  the distinction between the two tends to break down.  Take, for example, the address of the White House:  1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500  62     chaPter 2  10237.indb   62  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Washington, DC, is the largest geographic area, then the  zip code, then the street name, then the building number  on the street. This address is sufficient to uniquely identify  a  single  building:  there’s  only  one  Pennsylvania  Avenue  NW in Washington, DC  though there is a Pennsylvania  Ave SE , and there’s only one 1600 on Pennsylvania Ave  NW. It may be obvious, but it’s worth pointing out that  this is the entire point of the postal addressing system: to  uniquely identify buildings.  Many encoding schemes exist to create unique identi- fiers for specific types of resources: ISBNs and call numbers  for  books,  the  Digital  Object  Identifier   DOI   for  online  publications, the International Standard Recording Code   ISRC  for sound recordings, GPS coordinates for points  in physical space, ISO 8601 for dates and times, Social Se- curity numbers for citizens of the United States. There is  even a system to create unique identifiers for academic re- searchers, the ORCID identifier.  It’s especially important to be able to uniquely identify  entities online, for two reasons. First, there are many tech- nologies  that  can  be  used  to  access  objects  online.  HTTP  has emerged as the standard protocol for exchanging data  online, but this was not always the case. Even today, there  are many web browser applications, and it’s important that  when you type a URL into Chrome, it takes you to the same  webpage as if you type it into Safari or Firefox. Second, ob- jects on the web can be moved fairly easily, for example, if an      defInItIons      63  10237.indb   63  9 25 15   10:41 AM   http:  mitpress.mit.edu books metadata   }}}  Domain  Path  Scheme name  Figure 6  organization’s server infrastructure is changed. So it’s critical  to be able to indicate that even though some particular web  content has changed location, that it’s still the same content. The  way  this  is  accomplished  is  by  using  a  uniform  resource  identifier   URI .  The  uniform  resource  locator   URL  is a typical web address, and a type of URI. A URI  specifies a unique identifier in the network space of the  web, though you could also think of it as a unique address,  since one and only one object may exist at that address.  A  URI  is  to  resources  on  the  Internet  what  a  postal  address is to buildings in the physical world: an identifier  that uniquely specifies one and only one object. A URI  and  a postal address  is also metadata internal to the object.  Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that a URI   and a postal address  is metadata inherent in the object,  since moving the former will change the latter. And it is  this fact—that a unique identifier may be inherent in a re- source—that makes it perhaps the most important single  piece of metadata, providing the address  or name, or lo- cation  to which any external metadata record may point.  64     chaPter 2  10237.indb   64  9 25 15   10:41 AM   3  desCriPtive Metadata  Standards are like toothbrushes, everyone agrees that  they’re a good idea but nobody wants to use anyone  else’s. —Attributed to Murtha Baca, Getty Research Institute  chaPter 3  In this chapter we will explore what is arguably the sim- plest kind of metadata, and was certainly the first kind of  metadata to be extensively developed: descriptive meta- data. To do this, we will explore in depth one descriptive  metadata schema that was designed to be able to describe  literally anything: Dublin Core.  Dude, Where’s My Core?  The Dublin Core is not, as you might expect, named after  Dublin, Ireland. Rather, it’s named after Dublin, Ohio, a city   10237.indb   65  9 25 15   10:41 AM   just outside of Columbus. Dublin, Ohio, is the headquar- ters of the Online Computer Library Center, Inc.  OCLC ,  a nonprofit organization that develops and licenses many  tools for information organizations, and in particular is a  major player in the library market. Why is the Dublin Core  named after the city in which OCLC is headquartered? To  answer that question, believe it or not, we need to go back  to the origin of the World Wide Web.  In November 1993, the National Center for Supercom- puting Applications  NCSA  released Mosaic version 1.0.  Mosaic was the first application capable of simultaneously  displaying both text and image files on the Internet. This  is, of course, how we are now used to seeing the web. But  prior to the release of Mosaic, tools for accessing files on  the Internet could only display one file at a time. In 1993,  the functionality to display text and images side-by-side  made Mosaic a “killer app,” and in large part is responsible  for the popularization of the web. Within months, Mosaic  had a user base of millions worldwide, and by early 1995  the web, and its critical enabling technology, the Hyper- text Transfer Protocol  HTTP , had passed all other Inter- net-based  services  for  the  volume  of  data  being  moved.   We hardly think about these other services any more, but  once upon a time, FTP, Gopher, Telnet, WAIS, and other  services with now-odd-sounding names were very popular  ways to transfer data.   66     chaPter 3  10237.indb   66  9 25 15   10:41 AM   In March 1995, the NCSA and OCLC hosted an invi- tation-only  workshop  in  Dublin,  Ohio,  to  discuss  meta- data for the web. At that time Google did not yet exist,  was not yet even a research project. There were, however,  several search engines in existence, though none that had  achieved  much  in  the  way  of  market  dominance.  These  search engines were effective, for the time, though some- what primitive by current standards. The computer scien- tists  and  information  scientists  who  participated  in  the  1995 workshop recognized that searching the web was be- coming “siloed”: no search engine indexed the entire web,  and  search  engines  often  provided  the  user  with  no  de- scription of the files indexed beyond their names. Worse,  some tools  FTP, Gopher, etc.  allowed searching only of  files made available using those protocols. Thus the 1995  workshop was convened “to advance the state of the art  in the development of resource description  or metadata   records for networked electronic information objects.”  In  other  words,  the  consensus  at  the  workshop  was  that for web search tools to continue to be useful, files on  the web needed to be better described.  Subsequent devel- opments in information retrieval, network analysis, and  related fields open this up for debate. But that’s a discus- sion for another book.  Thus one of the goals of the work- shop was to reach consensus “on a core set of metadata  elements to describe networked resources.”     descrIPtIve Metadata      67  10237.indb   67  9 25 15   10:41 AM   A core set of metadata elements, from Dublin, Ohio.  If you’ll forgive pushing the metaphor in the quote at the  start of this chapter to its logical, yet disgusting extreme:  the Dublin Core was developed to be everyone’s toothbrush.  Cost of Adoption  The Dublin Core metadata element set was created as a  lowest  common  denominator.  This  is  not  meant  dispar- agingly, it was in fact a deliberate design decision: calling  something core carries with it the assumption that it is core  for everyone, for all use cases. It doesn’t do anyone any  good for one group to create a core set of something, only  to have some other group decide that isn’t the right set,  and create their own core set. That only leads to a prolifera- tion of standards.  Therefore, if the goal is to create a core set of some- thing, that set must be so appealing that everyone will use  it. To be a success, the Dublin Core metadata element set  had to be adopted widely, indeed adopted by everyone who  might have any kind of a need for it. So how to create a new  tool that will be adopted by everyone who might need it?  Fortunately,  scholars  have  been  studying  that  very  question  for  decades.  The  book  Diffusion  of  Innovations,  by Everett Rogers, is one of the most-cited works of social  science, and has spawned an entire discipline. This book   68     chaPter 3  10237.indb   68  9 25 15   10:41 AM   develops a model of how and why and how rapidly innova- tions are adopted into society as a whole. The figure here  shows the S-shaped curve of the rate of adoption of several  common household technologies. An innovation may be  a technology  for example, smartphones  or an idea  for  example, hand-washing as a strategy for improving public  health . Rogers, and the many researchers who have fol- lowed him, have articulated several factors that affect the  adoption or rejection of an innovation. The important one  of these, in the current context, is simplicity: in order to be  adopted, an innovation must be perceived as being simple  to use. Or, to state this in reverse: if those who might find  an innovation useful perceive it as being too complex, then  those potential users will never become actual users.  Complexity raises the cost of adopting an innovation.  Cost, of course, may mean financial cost, and new tech- nologies are often quite expensive. But it may also mean  other types of costs, such as time expended, or risks as- sumed. If I adopt a new and complex piece of technology,  it will take me some time to learn to use it, and the time  that  I  spend  scaling  that  learning  curve  is  a  cost  to  me.  Think about learning to drive a car: that’s very costly in  terms of the amount of time it probably took you to learn  to do it well  and probably also in the amount of stress you  caused  your  driving  instructor .  Furthermore  new  tech- nologies  are  often  unstable:  when  a  new  and  improved  version is released, early adopters of a new technology are      descrIPtIve Metadata      69  10237.indb   69  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Figure 7  10237.indb   70  9 25 15   10:41 AM   out the time and money that they sunk into that earlier  version. Think about media for digital video: early adopt- ers adopted videodiscs, which were completely supplanted  by DVDs, which were supplanted by Blu-ray discs… all of  which is currently in the process of being supplanted by  on-demand streaming media services.  15 Elements  Dublin Core was designed to be simple and low-cost, easy  to learn and easy to use. The intention was that it would  therefore  be  widely  adopted,  and  would  become  ubiqui- tous on the web. This was a very ambitious goal, especially  given how new the web was, and how rapidly it was evolv- ing, when work on Dublin Core began. What is perhaps  most remarkable is that it worked.  The participants in the 1995 OCLC   NCSA workshop  set out to develop a core set of descriptive metadata ele- ments that could be applied to any and all resources on the  Internet. That goal, paired with the equally ambitious goal of  simplicity, forces the question: What descriptive metadata  elements are absolutely necessary? What is the irreducible  set of metadata elements necessary to describe literally any  resource that exists, or might ever exist on the web?  It took several years for the Dublin Core metadata ele- ment set to stabilize. But in the end, 15 elements emerged  as core:     descrIPtIve Metadata      71  10237.indb   71  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Table 3  Coverage  Creator  Date  Format  Identifier  Language  Publisher  Relation  Rights  Source  Element  Definition  Contributor  An entity responsible for making contributions to the  resource.  Description  An account of the resource.  The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial  applicability of the resource, or the jurisdiction under  which the resource is relevant.  An entity primarily responsible for making the resource.  A point or period of time associated with an event in the  lifecycle of the resource.  The file format, physical medium, or dimensions of the  resource.  An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given  context.  A language of the resource.  An entity responsible for making the resource available.  A related resource.  Information about rights held in and over the resource.  A related resource from which the described resource is  derived.  Subject  The topic of the resource.  Title  Type  A name given to the resource.  The nature or genre of the resource.  72     chaPter 3  10237.indb   72  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Note that the Dublin Core was developed to describe  online  resources,  but  the  Format  element  refers  to  the  “physical  medium,  or  dimensions  of  the  resource.”  Ob- viously  neither  physical  medium  nor  dimensions  is  ap- plicable  to  digital  resources.  But  it’s  a  short  step  from  describing anything that exists on the web, to describing  anything that exists, period. As the Dublin Core metadata  element set evolved, it did not take long for the scope of  the Format element to expand to include physical descrip- tion. The Dublin Core metadata element set was created to  describe networked resources, but by virtue of being a low- est common denominator, it is low enough, so to speak, to  also describe physical resources.  Elements and Values  Now that we have seen that the Dublin Core metadata ele- ment set may be used to describe any type of resource, we  need to revisit the idea of an element. What does it mean  for Dublin Core to be a metadata element set?  Let us return to our working definition of metadata:  Metadata is a statement about a potentially  informative object  Recall that a resource may be literally anything. Any- thing that can be either physically or electronically pointed      descrIPtIve Metadata      73  10237.indb   73  9 25 15   10:41 AM   to  a painting, or a digital file of that painting  is consid- ered a resource.  Each of the 15 Dublin Core elements names an attri- bute or a characteristic of a resource, and enables the de- scription of that attribute. In other words, each element is  a category of statement that can be made about a resource:  the Creator of this resource is X, the Title of this resource is  Y, etc. Take this familiar piece of art as an example.  The first descriptive statement about this work of art  is the following: the Title of this resource is Mona Lisa. But  the Mona Lisa isn’t called that in Italian; it’s called La Gio- conda. Which Title should be used? Answer: Both. The de- scription of the Dublin Core element Title specifies that it  is “A name given to the resource”… it doesn’t specify that  it is “the name.” The freedom to repeat the same element  with different values—to make more than one of the same  kind  of  statement  about  a  resource,  but  saying  different  things—will be explored further below.  This painting is called La Gioconda after the subject of  the painting, Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Gio- condo. And so another statement about this painting is the  following: the Subject of this resource is Lisa Gherardini.  Yet another statement about this work is the follow- ing: the painter of this resource is Leonardo da Vinci. There  is, of course, no Painter element in Dublin Core. However,  Leonardo da Vinci is certainly “an entity primarily respon- sible for making” the Mona Lisa. Since the Dublin Core was   74     chaPter 3  10237.indb   74  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Figure 8     descrIPtIve Metadata      75  10237.indb   75  9 25 15   10:41 AM   designed  to  allow  description  of  literally  any  networked  resource, by necessity it’s agnostic as to the format of the  thing being described. Someone who creates a painting is  called a painter; someone who creates a book is called an  author, someone who creates a movie is called a filmmaker,  someone  who  creates  a  dance  is  called  a  choreographer,  etc. Many names exist for individuals who engage in differ- ent forms of creation, and these names are meaningful in  natural human language. But these shades of meaning are  irrelevant  for  lowest  common  denominator  description.  Dublin Core simply collapses all of these forms of creation  into one single category: Creator. The fact that semantics  are shared across domains—that subtleties of meaning are  flattened out so that the element definitions are as unam- biguous as possible—is both one of the greatest strengths  and one of the most serious limitations of Dublin Core.  Finally, it is thought that Leonardo da Vinci painted  the Mona Lisa between 1503 and 1506. And so five state- ments can now be made about this resource, five element- value pairs that compose a Dublin Core record:  Title: Mona Lisa  Title: La Gioconda  Creator: Leonardo da Vinci  76     chaPter 3  10237.indb   76  9 25 15   10:41 AM      The fact that semantics  are shared across   domains—that subtle- ties of meaning are   flattened out, so that  the element definitions  are as unambiguous as  possible—is both one of  the greatest strengths  and one of the most   serious limitations of  Dublin Core.     descrIPtIve Metadata      77  10237.indb   77  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Subject: Lisa Gherardini  Date: 1503–1506  Dublin Core, like many metadata schemas, includes rules  for the selection or construction of values. Recommended  best practice for the Date element, for example, is to use  an encoding scheme such as ISO 8601. Recommended best  practice for the Subject element is to select a value from a  controlled vocabulary; recommended best practice for the  Format element is to select a value specifically from the  controlled  vocabulary  of  Internet  MIME  types.  Recom- mended best practice for the Identifier element is to use  a value conforming to a formal unique identifier system;  recommended  best  practice  for  the  Relation  and  Source  elements is to identify the related resource using a unique  identifier. There is no recommended best practice for the  Creator element, though in practice often a name author- ity file will be used.  Descriptive Records  A Dublin Core record describes a resource. There are sev- eral purposes to which a descriptive metadata record could  be put. But one of the most important of these is resource  discovery, discussed in chapter 1.  78     chaPter 3  10237.indb   78  9 25 15   10:41 AM   A resource discovery tool is a piece of technology that  enables  users  to   obviously   discover  resources:  a  web  search engine, for example, or a library card catalog. And it  is the element-value pairs in a metadata record that make  that discovery possible. Each element-value pair is what’s  called an “access point”: a way in, if you will, to discovering  the resources described by the records available via the dis- covery tool. For example, if you’re interested in finding a  work of art called “Mona Lisa,” some metadata record must  contain the value Mona Lisa for the element Title. If you’re  interested  in  finding  work  by  Leonardo  da  Vinci,  some  metadata record must contain that name as the value as- signed to the element Creator.  This is one of the most important characteristics of a  metadata record: that it includes all element-value pairs  that might be useful. Of course, “usefulness” is highly sub- jective: one user might be interested in finding work by  Leonardo da Vinci, while another user might be interested  in  finding  Italian  Renaissance  portraiture;  the  element- value pairs that might be useful for these users might be  quite  different.  When  creating  a  metadata  record,  it  is  critical to consider all possible use cases, and include all  possibly relevant element-value pairs. Of course, for a re- source such as the Mona Lisa, this might mean repeating  an element with different values: Title: Mona Lisa, Title:  La Gioconda, Title: La Joconde. And so, in a Dublin Core  record, all elements are repeatable, with different values:      descrIPtIve Metadata      79  10237.indb   79  9 25 15   10:41 AM   more than one of the same kind of statement may be made  about a resource, but saying different things.  The flip side of this particular coin is another impor- tant characteristic of Dublin Core metadata records: all ele- ments are optional. If an element is irrelevant to a resource,  then it is not included in a record about that resource. For  example, while Leonardo da Vinci spoke Italian, that’s re- ally not relevant to describing the Mona Lisa itself. So the  Language element could just be left out of any Dublin Core  metadata record created to describe the Mona Lisa.  Artifacts, such as art objects or digital files, are gen- erally going to have a Creator, and a Title, and a Format,  and a Date. Characteristics of artifacts may be deliberately  assigned to them by their creator  such as title , or inher- ent in the process of their creation  such as format , and  all of these characteristics may be captured in a metadata  record.  On  the  other  hand,  what  about  natural  objects:  leaves,  rocks,  insects,  anything  not  created  by  human  agency?  In  this  case  many  of  the  elements  from  Dublin  Core would seem to make less sense. A leaf doesn’t have a  language. A rock doesn’t have a date of creation, or at least  not  one  that  can  be  known  with  the  degree  of  accuracy  that the date of creation of an artifact can be known. An  insect doesn’t have a creator, or at least not without invok- ing theology—and then everything that exists would have  the same Creator, which is actually not very useful from  the standpoint of resource discovery. In order for Dublin   80     chaPter 3  10237.indb   80  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Core to be a lowest common denominator, for it to be able  to describe anything and everything, not only are all ele- ments repeatable, but also any irrelevant element may be  left out of a record.  Qualified Dublin Core  As mentioned above, Dublin Core was developed to be a  lowest common denominator metadata element set. The  problem with the lowest common denominator, however,  is that sometimes it’s too low. For some use cases, more  than 15 elements may be necessary. There are therefore  three ways in which the Dublin Core element set can be  extended.  The core of Dublin Core, so to speak, is the 15 elements  discussed above. But the Dublin Core metadata element  set also includes a larger set of Terms. These incorporate  the core 15, but also include such Terms as modified  the  date of modification , hasPart  a related resource included  in the described resource , isPartOf  a related resource of  which the described resource is a part , audience  a cate- gory of entity, human or otherwise, for which the resource  is intended , and many others besides. It is not necessary  to list all of the Dublin Core Terms here. The point is that,  even while attempting to arrive at a core set of metadata  elements to describe any resource, those involved in the      descrIPtIve Metadata      81  10237.indb   81  9 25 15   10:41 AM   development of Dublin Core recognized that the minimal  set would be insufficient, for at least some uses. The first  extension of the Dublin Core element set is this set of 40  terms, in addition to the core 15 elements.  The second mechanism for extending Dublin Core is  by using a qualifier. A qualifier is specific to an individual  element,  and  specifies  a  narrower  interpretation—a  re- finement—of  the  element.  For  example,  imagine  an  in- teroffice memo: the first draft was written on the 1st of  December 2014, and it was edited twice, once on the 3rd  and again on the 5th. Further this memo pertains to the  first quarter of 2015, before which it should be embargoed,  and after which it will be irrelevant. All of these—the writ- ing of the first draft, the two edits, the embargo, and the  drop-dead date—are dates, and so can be described using  the Dublin Core Date element. But the Dublin Core Date  element is nonspecific: “A point or period of time associ- ated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource.” More  detail is needed to cover these more specific types of dates.  This detail can be achieved by appending qualifiers to the  Date element, like this:  Date.Created = 1 December 2014  Date.Modified = 3 December 2014  Date.Modified = 5 December 2014  82     chaPter 3  10237.indb   82  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Date.Valid = 1 January 2015–31 March 2015  In fact all of these qualifiers exist as Dublin Core Terms:  Created, Modified, and Valid. These specific refinements to  the Date element are so useful that they were among the  first  qualifiers  to  be  invented  after  Dublin  Core  was  de- veloped, and therefore in time were folded into the set of  Dublin Core Terms. This is the history of the development  of Dublin Core Terms: qualifiers to existing elements and  new elements developed for specific use cases, that proved  to be popular and useful, get folded into the set of Terms.  Some  of  these  use  cases  include  version  control   which  provided the Terms replaces and isReplacedBy , education   audience,  educationLevel,  instructionalMethod ,  and  intel- lectual  property   license,  rightsHolder,  accessRights .  The  set of Dublin Core Terms is thus always evolving.  What  enables  this  evolution  is  that  all  Dublin  Core  Terms  and  elements  and  qualifiers  must  be  constructed  according  to  the  Dublin  Core  Abstract  Model.  The  Ab- stract Model is a data model for subject-predicate-object  statements, specifying the concepts behind these subjects,  predicates, and objects, and how these may be combined  into graphs. This logical model is based on the Resource  Description Framework  RDF , which will be discussed in  chapter 6.  The cleverly named Darwin Core provides an example  of a use case that has not  yet?  been folded into the set      descrIPtIve Metadata      83  10237.indb   83  9 25 15   10:41 AM   of Dublin Core Terms. Darwin Core is a metadata schema  for  providing  descriptive  biodiversity  information.  The  Darwin Core includes such elements as continent, country,  island, and waterBody, which build on the Dublin Core term  location, as well as domain-specific elements such as king- dom  and  phylum.  Darwin  Core  elements  are  constructed  according the Dublin Core abstract model, and therefore  could be folded into Dublin Core; the question of whether  or not they ever will be may rest on whether these elements  are of sufficiently broad applicability to justify inclusion.  Finally,  the  third  mechanism  for  extending  Dublin  Core is by using an encoding scheme, as discussed in the  previous chapter, to clarify the interpretation of the value  for  an  element.  If  we  were  to  encode  our  memo’s  date  metadata in ISO 8601, for example, it would look like this:  Created = 2014–12–01  Modified = 2014–12–03  Modified = 2014–12–05  Valid = 2015–01–01 2015–03–31  Use of encoding schemes has also been folded into the  set of Dublin Core Terms. As discussed above, recommended  best practice for many Dublin Core elements  as well as for   84     chaPter 3  10237.indb   84  9 25 15   10:41 AM   many Terms  is to select or construct a value using a specific  controlled vocabulary or syntax encoding scheme.  Webpages  Perhaps  the  most  common  type  of  object  online  is  the  webpage: a document composed primarily of text, though  often with images, videos, or other media embedded in it,  and encoded in the HyperText Markup Language  HTML   for display in browsers. Just like anything else, a document  on the web may contain metadata within itself, or meta- data about a web document may live elsewhere.  As it happens, HTML has contained functionality to  enable  metadata  to  be  embedded  in  webpages  since  the  specification for version 2 was first published in 1995. The    element is a child of the   element—in other  words, it is contained inside the head section of a webpage.  The head section contains a variety of metadata about a  webpage, including the document title and stylesheet in- formation. The   element, then, contains metadata  about a webpage not otherwise specified in other child ele- ments of  . In other words,   is a bucket of  miscellaneous items.  The   tag has several attributes, but only two  are relevant here: name, the equivalent of a metadata el- ement,  and  content,  the  value  assigned  to  that  element.      descrIPtIve Metadata      85  10237.indb   85  9 25 15   10:41 AM   There are five standard values for name in HTML5: author   self-explanatory ,  description   also  self-explanatory ,  generator   the  application  with  which  the  webpage  was  created , application-name  the name of the web service of  which the webpage is a part, if any , and keywords  tags or  uncontrolled vocabulary terms . Thus, if a webpage were  created of this chapter, the metadata might look like this:     < meta name=“description” content=“Chapter 3 of  the book Metadata, published by MIT Press”   < meta name=“keywords” content=“metadata, Dublin  Core, Darwin Core, unique identifiers, meta tag, ISO  8601, Essential Knowledge Series” >  Author, description, generator, application-name, and  keywords are the values for name that are officially recog- nized  in  the  HTML5  specification  document.  However,  any value may be assigned to the name attribute… it’s pos- sible to simply make up your own.  Of course, we’re already familiar with the problem of  making up your own values: being so idiosyncratic that no  one knows what you’re talking about, like the Goodreads  user who tagged The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy with   86     chaPter 3  10237.indb   86  9 25 15   10:41 AM   “xxe.” Fortunately there is a middle ground between be- ing  incomprehensible  and  being  restricted  to  a  mere  5  choices, and that middle ground is to import a preexisting  metadata schema. For example, Dublin Core is frequently  used in the   element, so the Dublin Core element  becomes the value for the name attribute, and the value  assigned to the element becomes the value for content. To  continue to use the same example, the metadata for a web- page of this chapter might look like this:  < meta name=“dc.creator” content=“Jeffrey  Pomerantz” >  < meta name=“dc.description” content=“chapter 3 of  the book Metadata” >     < meta name=“dc.language” content=“en”  scheme=“ISO 639” >  < meta name=“dc.identifier”  content=“978-0-262-52851-1” scheme=“ISBN” >  < meta name=“dcterms.dateCopyrighted”  content=“2015” scheme=“ISO 8601” >     descrIPtIve Metadata      87  10237.indb   87  9 25 15   10:41 AM   < meta name=“dcterms.bibliographicCitation”  content=“Pomerantz, J.  2015 . Metadata.  Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press.” >  In short, the elements from any schema, and values  from any encoding scheme, may be embedded right into  an HTML document. This certainly seems like the realiza- tion of the goal of the 1995 workshop that gave rise to the  Dublin Core: to advance the state of the art of descriptive  metadata for online resources. We can declare victory and  move on. Right?  Search Engine Optimization  Wrong.  Because values for name and content can be invented  uniquely for individual webpages, the HTML   tag  is unfortunately quite easy to abuse… and abused it was.  “Keyword stuffing” used to be a fairly common “black hat”   that  is,  unethical   search  engine  optimization  strategy.  Search engine optimization is a set of strategies, constantly  evolving as web search engine technology evolves, for in- creasing the visibility of one’s website in a list of search  engine results. In general, the more lists of results a site  appears in, and the closer to the top of the list, the more   88     chaPter 3  10237.indb   88  9 25 15   10:41 AM   likely it is that search engine users will visit that site. There  are, of course, many legitimate search engine optimization  strategies, but keyword stuffing is not one of them. Key- word stuffing is the use of lots of irrelevant terms in the  meta tags in a webpage, in order for that webpage to be re- trieved by a search engine for as many searches as possible.  As a result of widespread keyword stuffing, Google—and  most other search engines—started to simply ignore meta  tags in webpages in the mid-2000s.  More  recently  Google—and  probably  most  other  search  engines—has  started  to  use  meta  tags  again,  though in a limited way. Google still ignores any content  associated  with  keywords  in  meta  tags   in  other  words,  any tag like this:   .  But Google does use the content associated with the de- scription: when displaying a list of results in response to a  search, Google may use the description in a meta tag as the  snippet to display for a webpage.  Conclusion  Using Dublin Core as an example makes it easy to illustrate  many principles of descriptive metadata. As ubiquitous as  descriptive metadata is, however, Dublin Core itself is not  all that widely used. But Dublin Core was developed to be a      descrIPtIve Metadata      89  10237.indb   89  9 25 15   10:41 AM   metadata core for the web. So what went wrong? Is Dublin  Core a failure?  Yes and no. As should be clear to anyone who has ever  created a webpage, there is in fact no metadata core to the  web. As discussed above, the thinking at the 1995 OCLC  workshop in Dublin, Ohio, was that descriptive metadata  was necessary for the success of web search tools. Improve- ments in full-text searching, and the development of tools  such as Google that take advantage not only of text but of  the network structure and other features of the web, have  subsequently shown that that is not in fact so.  Nevertheless, as one of the earliest and largest scale  centralized efforts to develop metadata for the web, Dub- lin Core set the tone for much later metadata development.  The Resource Description Framework, mentioned briefly  above, predates the development of the Dublin Core Ab- stract Model, but Dublin Core was perhaps the first meta- data  initiative  to  implement  the  RDF  data  model,  thus  promoting the idea that metadata development should be  a rigorous and formalized process. As metadata is increas- ingly understood to be central to the success of large-scale  collaborative  projects  managing  information  resources,  initiatives such as the Digital Public Library of America and  Europeana  and  dbpedia  are  developing  their  own  meta- data schemas, but these schemas rest on the Dublin Core  element set and terms. Using Dublin Core as an example  makes it easy to illustrate many principles of metadata, for   90     chaPter 3  10237.indb   90  9 25 15   10:41 AM   the simple reason that those principles were worked out by  the groups that developed Dublin Core in the first place.  Throughout  the  rest  of  this  book,  we  will  explore  metadata  schemas  that  build  on  these  principles—even  if not on Dublin Core explicitly. In particular, descriptive  metadata will reappear in chapter 7, with our discussion of  the semantic web, and the metadata that enables it.     descrIPtIve Metadata      91  10237.indb   91  9 25 15   10:41 AM   10237.indb   92  9 25 15   10:41 AM   4  adMinistrative Metadata  The nice thing about standards is that there are so many  of them to choose from. —Admiral Grace Hopper  chaPter 4  A picture may be worth a thousand words, but a thousand  words are not worth much as a metadata record. A thou- sand words are equivalent to approximately 3 1 2 pages  of  this  book,  which may  not  seem  like  a  lot  of  data  but  would make for an exceptionally rich metadata record. So  exceptional is this in fact that metadata records of that size  rarely exist. One of the functions of a metadata record is to  be a proxy for an object, and for a proxy to be effective, it  generally must be simpler than the original object.  A proxy may serve a variety of purposes. One simple  and obvious use of a metadata record as a proxy for a re- source is as a stand-in for discovery. In the previous chapter  we looked at descriptive metadata: metadata that simply   10237.indb   93  9 25 15   10:41 AM   provides  descriptive  information  about  characteristics  or attributes of a resource. A primary use of descriptive  metadata  records  is  for  resource  discovery.  Discovery  is  not the only reason that information about characteristics  or attributes of a resource might be useful, however; such  descriptive metadata may also be useful for informing the  maintenance of a resource. Metadata about the origin of a  resource, its history, current state, and plans for its future  may inform the “care and feeding” of a resource.  In  this  chapter  we  will  look  at  administrative  meta- data: metadata schemas that provide information about  the full life cycle of a resource, information that may be  used in the administration of resources. It probably goes  without saying that there are a great many administrative  metadata schemas in existence, so naturally we will be able  to look at only a small fraction of them: this chapter will  explore schemas for only a few types of common objects.  The goal of this chapter is not to provide you with an ex- haustive view of administrative metadata schemas for any  need, but instead to introduce you to the range of use cases  for which administrative metadata is a solution.  Administrative metadata is a very big umbrella. It is so  big that some texts separate out as entirely independent  categories some types of metadata that are treated here  as subcategories of administrative metadata: specifically,  technical  and  preservation  metadata.  These  are  treated  here as subcategories of administrative metadata because  there is considerable overlap in the function and uses of   94     chaPter 4  10237.indb   94  9 25 15   10:41 AM   these  types  of  metadata:  preservation  metadata,  for  ex- ample, provides information to support the processes in- volved in ensuring that a resource continues to exist over  time, and surely such care and feeding is a form of admin- istration. Rights metadata provides information that may  be  used  to  control  who  gets  access  to  a  resource,  under  what conditions, and what they can do with it, and surely  such access control is a form of administration.  We  will  begin  with  technical  metadata,  which  is  the  flavor of administrative metadata that is perhaps simplest  to understand. Technical metadata provides information  about  how  a  system  functions,  or  system-level  details  about resources.  Technical Metadata: Digital Photography  Digital photography is one of the most familiar situations  in which technical metadata plays a role—and the data is  often created entirely automatically. Most modern digital  cameras and smartphones embed a rich metadata record  into  the  image  file  that  is  a  photograph.  That  metadata  comes along with the file when the image is downloaded  from the camera, moved to another computer, or uploaded  to a photo-sharing site such as Flickr or Instagram.  The  metadata  schema  used  by  most  modern  digital  cameras is the Exchangeable image file format  Exif . An      adMInIstratIve Metadata      95  10237.indb   95  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Exif record contains a fairly large number of elements and  values. These are of three distinct types. Values that are set  by the manufacturer, and are consistent over the lifetime  of the device include the Manufacturer and Model. Values  that are configurable by the user include X- and Y-Reso- lution and Exposure. Values that change from one photo- graph to the next include the Date and time, Orientation   landscape or portrait , whether or not the flash fired, and  GPS coordinates. Figure 9 shows some of the Exif data as- sociated with a photo uploaded to Flickr.  All this metadata is generated at the moment of cre- ation of a digital photograph, and embedded in the image  file—and the person holding the camera does not need to  do anything. After purchasing a digital camera, a photog- rapher will probably set the internal clock, and will prob- ably  change  the  exposure  or  resolution  of  photos  under  different  conditions.  But  it  is  possible  that  most  casual  photographers are not even aware of the existence of this  metadata, as it is created automatically and invisibly at the  moment of creation of the digital object itself.  Several software applications and websites exist that  allow you to view and edit Exif data. Image management  and  processing  applications  such  as  iPhoto  and  Adobe  Photoshop, and photo hosting services such as Flickr and  Instagram,  display  Exif  data.  There  are  websites  and  pl- ugins for web browsers that will expose this metadata for  images on the web. Third-party services can also extract   96     chaPter 4  10237.indb   96  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Figure 9  this metadata from digital images to make use of it in a  variety of ways. The project I Know Where Your Cat Lives   iknowwhereyourcatlives.com   makes  use  of  GPS  data  embedded in Exif records to position photographs of cats      adMInIstratIve Metadata      97  10237.indb   97  9 25 15   10:41 AM   from web-based photo hosting services on a world map;  the project Photosynth  photosynth.net  takes this a step  further and stitches together multiple photos taken near  the same location into panoramic views.  Exif records are, of course, only one form of techni- cal  metadata,  and  moreover  are  specific  to  one  type  of  resource,  digital  image  files.  Technical  metadata  is  gen- erated,  often  automatically,  at  the  time  of  creation  and  modification of all digital files. I am writing this chapter in  Microsoft Word, for example, and by viewing the proper- ties of this file, I can see the date and time on which I first  created this file  about six months ago , the date and time  of the last saved modification to this file  about a minute  ago , the number of minutes this file has been open for  editing  more than I care to admit , and many other pieces  of technical metadata besides.  Even if this data was not embedded in this Word docu- ment, it would be possible to extract some of it from the  file system on my computer. All computer operating sys- tems display some technical metadata about the files on  a computer: the date and time of creation, the last modi- fied date and time, the size of the file. The UNIX operating  system goes a step further and displays information about  the access permissions to files: rights metadata, which will  be discussed below. Technical metadata captures informa- tion about the characteristics of a resource, and as such has  considerable overlap with descriptive metadata: the size   98     chaPter 4  10237.indb   98  9 25 15   10:41 AM   and type of a file, for example, may be considered descrip- tive or technical metadata, depending on the context. The  characteristics of a resource captured by technical meta- data, however, are those that require no human judgment  to identify, which allows technical metadata to be captured  automatically by software. Naturally, as algorithms for ma- chine processing of digital files improve, the greater the  number  and  types  of  characteristics  of  resources  that  it  will be possible to capture automatically.  Structural Metadata: MPEG-21  If digital photography is one of the most familiar situa- tions in which technical metadata plays a role, then digi- tal video is one of the most familiar situations in which  structural metadata plays a role. MPEG-21 is a standard  from the International Organization for Standardization   ISO  that defines an open framework on which applica- tions can be built to serve and display multimedia files.  The heart of the MPEG-21 standard is the Digital Item, a  structured digital object that may include videos, images,  audio tracks, or other resources, plus data describing the  relationships between these resources.  The  Digital  Item  Declaration  Language   DIDL   de- scribes a set of terms and concepts for describing digital  items.  Among  these  are  Container,  which  may  contain  a      adMInIstratIve Metadata      99  10237.indb   99  9 25 15   10:41 AM   number  of  child  entities,  including  a  descriptor,  items,  and other containers. An Item is a digital item that may  be displayed to a user via a multimedia player application;  an item may contain sub-items  as a music album contains  individual songs , descriptors, and conditions. A Descriptor  is descriptive metadata about a Container or an Item. A  Condition defines a test that must be performed by a mul- timedia player prior to displaying a file  for example, what  file format to display . The DIDL includes many other ele- ments as well, which collectively determine the contents of  a multimedia object and how it will be displayed in a range  of software and rights environments. Structural  metadata  captures   information  about  the  organization  of  a  resource.  A  very  simple  structural  metadata record might describe a book, providing infor- mation about the order of chapters, and the order of sec- tions within each chapter. An MPEG-21 record provides  similar information about multimedia files: which digital  items must play in what order, which audio track must play  alongside which video item, etc.  Provenance Metadata  Digital files are easily duplicated. It takes little effort to  make a copy, and storage space is cheap. Indeed copying  is  so  easy  that  entire  technology  stacks  literally  cannot   100     chaPter 4  10237.indb   100  9 25 15   10:41 AM   operate without it: every time you view a resource on the  web, for example, your browser creates a copy of that re- source. In economic terms, the marginal cost of produc- tion  for  digital  resources  is  nearly  zero.  Because  of  this,  data about the provenance of resources is more important  in the online world than perhaps it ever was in the physical  world, where duplication is far more time-consuming and  expensive.  The provenance of a resource, according to the World  Wide Web Consortium  W3C  Provenance Incubator Group,  is “a record that describes entities and processes involved  in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing that  resource.” In other words, provenance means not just the  history of a resource but the relationships between that re- source and other entities that have influenced its history.  In 2007 a tool called WikiScanner was launched, which  identified  the  individuals  and  organizations  responsible  for  editing  any  specified  Wikipedia  article.  WikiScanner  captured the history of a Wikipedia article, cross-checked  the IP addresses in the history with the Whois service  a  reverse phone directory for the Internet, so to speak, that  allows one to look up to whom an IP address is registered ,  and displayed that list. It should come as no surprise that  many controversial edits were uncovered using WikiScan- ner: edits to the Wikipedia page about Pepsi made from  IP  addresses  registered  to  the  Pepsi  Corporation,  edits  to  the  Wikipedia  page  about  the  Exxon  Valdez  oil  spill      adMInIstratIve Metadata      101  10237.indb   101  9 25 15   10:41 AM   made from IP addresses registered to ExxonMobil, edits  to Wikipedia pages about Australian politics from IP ad- dresses registered to the Australian Department of Prime  Minister and Cabinet, among many others. Perhaps these  edits were perfectly legitimate—after all, who knows more  about  Pepsi  than  the  Pepsi  Corporation?—but  it’s  clear  that some investigation is justified.  Sadly,  WikiScanner  is  now  defunct.   Though  a  new  service called WikiWatchdog replicates much of the same  functionality.   But  the  short  happy  life  of  WikiScanner  throws into sharp relief why data about the provenance  of a resource is absolutely critical. Electronic resources are  both easy to duplicate, and easy to edit—some  like wikis   easier than others. WikiScanner makes it abundantly clear  that knowing the history of an online resource is necessary  but not sufficient; to be able to trust in the validity and  reliability of a resource, it is also necessary to know what  entities have influenced that history.  If metadata is a statement about a resource, that begs  the question of who is making that statement. Metadata  is an assertion that someone makes about something. But  how trustworthy or reliable or accurate is that assertion?  The Internet is a big place, and it is not possible to know  everything about the entities that created or otherwise in- fluenced the history of a resource. Provenance metadata  is a mechanism to provide data about those entities, and  their relationships to the resource and to other entities. In   102     chaPter 4  10237.indb   102  9 25 15   10:41 AM   short, provenance metadata is a way of situating a resource  in a social network, to provide context that a user might  need  to  evaluate  a  resource.  In  the  very  large  network  space of the Internet, provenance metadata is a proxy for  the more direct and first-hand knowledge about entities  that could inform a user’s decision about the trustworthi- ness of a resource.  Several provenance metadata schemas currently exist;  the  standardization  that  has  occurred  in  other  domains  and for other use cases  Dublin Core for general use, Getty  thesauri for art objects, Exif for digital images, etc.  has  yet to emerge for provenance. These provenance schemas  share many characteristics: they are all composed of sets  of  elements  that  identify  characteristics  of  the  resource  or of entities that have influenced it, and they all catego- rize relationships between resources and entities. Work by  the W3C to develop a provenance data model nicely illus- trates this. The three “core structures” in this data model  are  entity,  agent,  and  activity,  consistent  with  the  W3C  Provenance Incubator Group’s definition: an entity is a re- source, an agent is an entity that has influenced the life  cycle of that resource, and an activity is the nature of that  influence. Entities may be derived from other entities, or  attributed to an agent; entities may be generated by or used  in activities; et cetera.  The W3C put a great deal of excellent work into de- veloping  recommendations  for  provenance  standards.      adMInIstratIve Metadata      103  10237.indb   103  9 25 15   10:41 AM      If metadata is a state- ment about a resource,  that begs the question  of who is making that  statement.  104     chaPter 4  10237.indb   104  9 25 15   10:41 AM   WasDerivedFrom  WasInformedBy  Entity  Activity  WasGeneratedBy  WasAttributedTo  WasAssociatedWith  Agent  ActedOnBehalfOf  Figure 10  Much of this work has been folded into the development of  PREMIS, an even broader schema for capturing metadata  about the preservation of resources.  Preservation Metadata: PREMIS  Perhaps  the  most  fully  developed  metadata  schema  for  supporting  preservation  is  another  standard  from  the  Library of Congress: Preservation Metadata Implementa- tion Strategies. PREMIS was developed to be a core set of      adMInIstratIve Metadata      105  10237.indb   105  9 25 15   10:41 AM   metadata elements for the preservation of digital objects.  The  use  of  the  word  “core”  here  is  meant  in  the  Dublin  Core sense: the PREMIS element set is intended to be the  minimum necessary to capture data about how to preserve  digital objects over time.  According  to  the  PREMIS  documentation,  preserva- tion  metadata  is  “the  information  a  repository  uses  to  support the digital preservation process.” The definition  of  “repository”  is  left  slightly  ambiguous,  but  it  can  be  understood to be an online collection of resources that’s  managed over the long term. There are several categories  of information that a repository uses to support the digital  preservation process: viability, renderability, understand- ability, authenticity, and identity. In other words, a reposi- tory must ensure that a digital object continues to exist  over time, that it remains possible to display and use it,  and that the original or canonical version can be identified,  versus copies or modified versions.  The PREMIS data model defines four entities of im- portance  to  the  preservation  process:  objects   digital  re- sources, which may be abstract intellectual entities such  as the collection of representations of the Mona Lisa, or  specific resources such as a specific digital photograph of  the Mona Lisa , agents  people or organizations that may  influence  the  object ,  events   time-stamped  actions  per- formed  by  agents  on  the  object ,  and  rights  statements   permissions such as intellectual property rights . Each of   106     chaPter 4  10237.indb   106  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Rights Statement  Assertion of right or  permission  Person, organization,  Environment  Object  or software  Agent  Person, organization,  or software  Event  An action that involves  an Object or an Agent known to the system   Figure 11  these entities contains a set of “semantic units,” which in  other metadata schemas would be called elements.  PREMIS  specifies  a  large  number  of  semantic  units  for these four entities. Semantic units for Objects include  some familiar ones, such as size, format, and creatingAp- plication, as well as some less familiar, such as significant- Properties  characteristics of a resource that are important  enough to be preserved  and preservationLevel  the preser- vation functions to be applied to an Object . Other seman- tic  units  are  likewise  familiar:  name,  type,  and  identifier      adMInIstratIve Metadata      107  10237.indb   107  9 25 15   10:41 AM   for Agents; date, description, and identifier for Events; etc.  PREMIS also suggests how to create or select values for  some semantic units, though these suggestions are often  even less prescriptive than Dublin Core’s “recommended  best practice”: while Dublin Core recommends use of an  encoding scheme such as ISO 8601 for the Date element,  PREMIS merely suggests that the value for the semantic  unit  dateCreatedByApplication  “should  use  a  structured  form.” In other areas, however, PREMIS is far more pre- cise than almost any other metadata element set, in order  to provide as much detail as possible to support the digi- tal preservation process. Recall, for example, that recom- mended best practice for the Dublin Core Format element  is to select a value from the controlled vocabulary of In- ternet MIME types. PREMIS makes this same recommen- dation, with such an additional degree of specificity that  there are actually 9 format-related semantic units, includ- ing formatName, formatVersion, and formatRegistry  a link  to or a unique identifier for the full format specification .  Rights Metadata  The issue of copyright looms large over any initiative that  deals with digital resources, so it was probably inevitable  that several metadata schemas to capture data about rights  have been developed. The first of these is of course Dublin   108     chaPter 4  10237.indb   108  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Core. Recall from the previous chapter that one of the core  15 elements of Dublin Core is rights, the value for which  should be “a statement about various property rights as- sociated with the resource.” Three additional Dublin Core  Terms  qualifying  the  rights  element  also  exist:  license   a  legal document , rightsHolder  an individual or organiza- tion , and accessRights  what rights a rightsHolder has to  access a resource, based on policies that are presumably  laid  out  in  the  license .  Dublin  Core  provides  a  minimal  number  of  terms  for  capturing  data  about  rights,  all  of  which are quite broad, with no recommended best prac- tices for how to select or construct values. This leaves the  door open to richer schemas for declaring rights metadata. One of the more widely used of these is the Creative  Commons Rights Expression Language  CC REL . Creative  Commons is a project to enable sharing of creative work,  through  the  development  of  standardized  legal  licenses  that allow creators to selectively keep some of the several  different  rights  bundled  together  under  the  heading  of  “copyright,” while allowing some uses of their work. In or- der to accomplish this, Creative Commons has inevitably  had to parse copyright exceedingly fine. As a result Cre- ative Commons has articulated in detail the entities and  relationships involved in copyright. The specification for  CC REL identifies two classes of properties: properties of  a work, and properties of the license for that work. Work  properties include title, type, and source, which are drawn      adMInIstratIve Metadata      109  10237.indb   109  9 25 15   10:41 AM   directly  from  Dublin  Core.  Work  properties  also  include  the original attributionName, “the name to cite when giv- ing  attribution  when  the  work  is  modified  or  redistrib- uted,”  and  attributionURL,  the  URL  to  provide  for  that  attribution, preferably a unique identifier. License proper- ties are the following: permits, prohibits, requires, jurisdic- tion  the legal jurisdiction in which the license applies , and  legalCode  the text of the license . A small controlled vo- cabulary provides values for these properties: the possible  values for permits, for example, are Reproduction, Distri- bution, and DerivativeWorks, while CommercialUse is the  only possible value for prohibits. The Creative Commons  makes use of CC REL in their standardized legal licenses,  and even provides a tool on their website that guides the  user through the process of deciding which of their several  licenses is most appropriate for a resource.  The last rights metadata schema that will be addressed  here  is  the  METSRights  Rights  Declaration  Schema,  or  RightsDeclarationMD.  This  schema  was  developed  to  be  an  extension  to  the  Metadata  Encoding  and  Transmis- sion Standard; METS will be discussed in more detail be- low.  RightsDeclarationMD  has  three  top-level  elements:  RightsDeclaration  the rights associated with a resource ,  RightsHolder  an individual or organization , and Context   a  description  of  what  rights  holders  have  what  rights,  and  under  what  circumstances .  Each  of  these  top-level   110     chaPter 4  10237.indb   110  9 25 15   10:41 AM   elements  has  attributes:  one  attribute  of  RightsDeclara- tion, for example, is RightsCategory, which may be popu- lated with the values from a small controlled vocabulary  that  includes  copyrighted,  licensed,  public  domain,  etc.  The Context element is fairly complex, and includes several  attributes and subelements. One subelement of Context is  Permissions, which also has a small controlled vocabulary  associated with it, including such values as discover, dis- play, copy, modify, and delete.  Copyright is a large and complex area of law; it there- fore lends itself to multiple mechanisms for reducing that  complexity. The rights metadata schemas here are all at- tempts to reduce the complexity of copyright to a metadata  schema of manageable size. These schemas have arrived at  similar, yet slightly different solutions to this problem. As  mentioned above, the arena of provenance metadata sche- mas is still in flux, unlike other areas such as art and digital  images, where standards have emerged. The arena of copy- right  sits  somewhere  in  between  these:  multiple  rights  metadata schemas exist, and these schemas, in principle,  may be more or less interchangeable but, in practice, have  become standard for certain use cases. Creative Commons  licenses,  for  example,  are  widespread  on  the  web,  while  RightsDeclarationMD has narrower use in the library and  archive community, which is where the Metadata Encod- ing and Transmission Standard originated.     adMInIstratIve Metadata      111  10237.indb   111  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Meta-Metadata  This chapter has addressed several metadata schemas, for  a variety of types of resources and use cases. But now it  is time to discuss the one metadata schema to rule them  all:  METS,  the  Metadata  Encoding  and  Transmission  Standard.  METS  was  developed  in  response  to  the  increase  in  the early 2000s in digital resources on the web from librar- ies, archives, museums, and cultural heritage institutions  of  all  types,  and  the  concomitant  increase  in  metadata  schemas for those resources. At that time there was also  an increase in the number of repositories in which digital  resources were being stored: universities were developing  institutional repositories for publications, disciplinary re- positories were emerging outside of universities  such as  arxiv.org , cultural heritage institutions were developing  digital libraries for their collections, and software  such as  DSpace, eprints, and Fedora  was being developed to en- able institutions to easily create institutional repositories  and digital libraries. In order to deal with this prolifera- tion of content and functionality, METS was to provide a  standard structure for metadata about resources, as well  as to ensure that metadata could be exchanged between  repositories. METS is a metadata schema that enables the  creation of a container—called a “document”—for meta- data records.  As previously discussed, what is considered   112     chaPter 4  10237.indb   112  9 25 15   10:41 AM   data and what is metadata is largely a matter of your point  of view. METS places this issue squarely in the forefront,  as the metadata records contained within a METS docu- ment must be considered the data to METS’ metadata, the  Subject to a METS document’s Object.  A METS document  is, according to the METS documentation, “a mechanism  for recording the various relationships that exist between  pieces of content, and between the content and metadata  that compose a digital library object.”  A METS document has 7 parts:  The Header contains metadata about the METS document  itself, rather than about the resource described in the  document. In other words, if METS is metadata about  metadata records, the Header section of a METS docu- ment  is  a  metadata  record  about  the  metadata  about  metadata records. Elements in the Header include the  date of creation of the document, date last modified,  and  the  role  of  agents  associated  with  the  document   Creator, Editor, Archivist, Intellectual Property Owner,  etc. .  The Descriptive metadata section contains, unsurprisingly,  descriptive metadata. Like PREMIS, METS is agnostic  as to which descriptive metadata schemas are used in  a document, since there are so many of them to choose  from;  in  fact  METS  allows  multiple  descriptive  meta- data sections, so that multiple schemas can be used to      adMInIstratIve Metadata      113  10237.indb   113  9 25 15   10:41 AM   describe a single resource. The Descriptive section does  not provide any elements native to METS for describ- ing a resource; all description is provided by metadata  records in other schemas that are either “wrapped” in  or linked from the METS document. Elements that are  provided  in  the  Descriptive  section,  however,  include  the  type  of  metadata  record  “imported”  into  the  De- scriptive section, the date of creation of that record, the  size of the record, and a unique identifier for the record.  The  Administrative  metadata  section  is  subdivided  into  four sections that accommodate four different types of  administrative  metadata:  technical,  intellectual  prop- erty rights, source, and provenance metadata. Like the  Descriptive  section,  the  Administrative  section  does  not  provide  any  native  elements  for  describing  the  administration of a resource, but allows records from  other administrative metadata schemas to be wrapped  in or linked from the METS document.  METS  employs  this  approach,  of  allowing  metadata  re- cords  in  other  schemas  to  be  either  wrapped  in  the  METS document or linked to from it, in several sections.  Both approaches have their pros and cons. When meta- data records are linked to from the METS document, it  is the File section that keeps the inventory. Elements  in the File section include the unique identifier of the  “element” of the METS document  that is, the metadata   114     chaPter 4  10237.indb   114  9 25 15   10:41 AM   record  linked  to ,  and  the  date  of  creation,  size,  and  MIME type of that element.  The Structural map section provides a mechanism for orga- nizing the elements of the METS document identified  in the File section, and is in fact the only required sec- tion of a METS document. Perhaps the most important  element provided in the Structural map section is the  Type of structure, which allows for both physical objects  with physical structure  for example, a book divided into  pages that must be in sequence  or digital objects with  logical  structure   for  example,  an  album  divided  into  tracks , or both. Other elements in the Structural map  section include labels and identifiers for each section.  The  Structural link  section  of  a  METS  document  is  mer- cifully simple: it is simply a mechanism for specifying  links between different sections of a METS document.  For example, if a METS document describes a webpage,  the Structural link section specifies the links between  that webpage and any image files embedded in it.  The Behavior section is the part of a METS document in  which these rules for action may be represented, by as- sociating executable software code with other elements  in the METS document. Recall from chapter 2 that an  ontology builds on a thesaurus: an ontology is a set of  entities and their relationships, as well as a set of rules,  which may be rules for action.      adMInIstratIve Metadata      115  10237.indb   115  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Conclusion  As mentioned at the start of this chapter, Administrative  metadata is a very big umbrella, with many subtypes, and  often multiple schemas exist for each of these subtypes.  The nice thing about standards is that there are so many  of them to choose from.  That said, though, there is only one function for ad- ministrative metadata, in all its forms: to provide informa- tion that may be useful in the management of a resource,  throughout its life cycle. Since resources are diverse, how- ever, the life cycle and management of resources is equally  diverse.  There  is  inevitably  some  overlap  between  adminis- trative and descriptive metadata schemas, as it would be  difficult, if not impossible, to manage a resource without  first having some descriptive information about it. Thus,  while descriptive schemas may contain administrative ele- ments, administrative schemas must necessarily contain  descriptive elements. In the next chapter, yet a third broad  category of metadata schemas will be explored, one that  serves a very different function than either descriptive or  administrative schemas: use metadata.  116     chaPter 4  10237.indb   116  9 25 15   10:41 AM   5  use Metadata  chaPter 5  What was the last phone number you called? Where were  you  when  you  placed  that  call?  What  was  the  last  thing  you bought from Amazon, and what other items were part  of that same order? How much money did you withdraw  the last time you used an ATM, and was that ATM part of  your bank’s network? What were the last 25 websites that  you visited?  These  are  all  fairly  simple  questions  about  what  are  likely to be your everyday behaviors, but some of them are  probably difficult for you to answer: an unfortunate quirk  of  memory  is  that  everyday  occurrences  are  sometimes  the most difficult things to remember. It is, however, pos- sible for others to answer these questions about you. As  discussed previously in the context of the NSA’s collection  of phone metadata, your cell phone carrier collects data  about all the numbers you call and that call you, as well as  the location of your phone. I personally have been using   10237.indb   117  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Amazon since 1996, and if I were so inclined, I could view  a complete history of every order I’ve made. I do not have  access to a history of all of my ATM transactions, but my  bank surely does. And both my browser and my Internet  service provider have records of every website I’ve visited.  And since I’ve been using the Chrome browser for several  years, Google probably also has a record of every website  I’ve visited in that time.  You may find all of this data collection ominous; many  people do. That, however, is an issue for another time: the  politics of use metadata will be explored in the final chap- ter of this book. This chapter, however, explores the vari- ety of types of use metadata.  “We Kill People Based on Metadata.”  General Michael Hayden made this rather alarming state- ment in the panel debate “Re-evaluating the NSA,” at Johns  Hopkins University in April 2014. And General Hayden is a  former Director of both the National Security Agency and  the Central Intelligence Agency, so it’s a pretty sure thing  that he knows what he’s talking about.  How  is  death  by  metadata  even  possible?  Although  anything  from  Assassinations  to  Zombie  art  may  be  de- scribed by the Art & Architecture Thesaurus, no one is go- ing to kill anyone over a controlled vocabulary.  118     chaPter 5  10237.indb   118  9 25 15   10:41 AM      We kill people based   on metadata.     use Metadata      119  10237.indb   119  9 25 15   10:41 AM   The answer is that metadata can be incredibly reveal- ing. In particular, the type of metadata known as use meta- data captures a great deal of data about individuals and  individuals’ behaviors. Further, not only can use metadata  reveal information about individuals, it can also provide  rich data about social networks, and the connections be- tween individuals, places, and organizations. Human be- ings are social animals, so when describing a person, it’s  almost inevitable that you’ll wind up describing that per- son’s  relationships  with  other  people.  And  it  should  be  clear  from  the  very  brief  foray  into  network  analysis  in  chapter  2,  that  once  you  start  discussing  relationships,  you’re discussing networks.  The game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon provides a silly  but  nevertheless  illuminating  example.  The  goal  of  this  game is to start with any actor or actress, and to connect  him or her to Kevin Bacon in six or fewer steps, a step being  defined as who was in a movie with whom. For example,  Max Schreck  who played the vampire Count Orlok in the  1922 silent film Nosferatu , was in Boykott with Wolfgang  Zilzer, who was in Lovesick with Elizabeth McGovern, who  was in She’s Having a Baby with Kevin Bacon—thus giving  Max Schreck the surprisingly low Bacon number of 3. The  game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon was obviously based on  the idea of “Six Degrees of Separation,” made famous by  the stage play and movie of the same name, that anyone  in the world is connected to anyone else through no more   120     chaPter 5  10237.indb   120  9 25 15   10:41 AM   than six other people—provided that you can identify the  correct six.  “Six Degrees of Separation” was, in turn, in- fluenced by Stanley Milgram’s 1967 “small world experi- ment,” which was one of the first empirical studies of social  networks.  Variations on this idea are relatively common.  Another popular example is the Erdős number, named af- ter the mathematician Paul Erdős, who collaborated and  co-authored papers very widely. Erdős’ co-authors  511 of  them  have an Erdős number of 1, their co-authors have an  Erdős Number of 2  9,267 people , and so on.  Amusingly,  Paul Erdős has a Bacon number of 4, as he was the subject  of a documentary, N Is a Number. Kevin Bacon, however,  has an Erdős number of infinity, which means that there  is  no  connection,  as  Kevin  Bacon  has  never  published  a  mathematics paper.   The graphs that make Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon and  calculating someone’s Erdős number possible are quite sim- ple: the nodes in these graphs are actors or mathematicians,  and the edges are “was in a movie with” or “co-authored a  paper with.” Facebook has taken this idea of a dramatically  simplified social network and built a business model on it.  Nodes in Facebook are people, places, and things, and edges  are “friend” and “likes,” thus making Facebook’s social graph  somewhat more complex than the Bacon or Erdős graphs,  but still a simplified version of reality.  Now imagine a social graph that actually attempts to  capture  the  complexity  of  interpersonal  relationships  in      use Metadata      121  10237.indb   121  9 25 15   10:41 AM   the physical world. Nodes will still be people, places, and  things, but there may be categories of each: cities, songs,  buildings, food items, what have you. Edges may have a  wide  range  of  values:  between  people  you  might  have  friend,  acquaintance,  sibling,  parent,  spouse,  neighbor,  coworker, employer, employee, etc.; between people and  places you might have resides, used to reside, born, works,  went to college, etc. The possibilities are not infinite, but  are certainly very large, as the variety of human behavior  and relationships is very large.  When building a social network—when attempting to  categorize nodes and label edges—it’s probably futile to  attempt to exhaustively capture every variety of person,  thing, and relationship, as it is too large a set. The critical  task is to decide what the important categories of nodes  and labels for edges are, for the network you’re attempting  to create. These are very simple in Six Degrees of Kevin  Bacon, which makes it easy for anyone to play the game.  Facebook is somewhat more complicated, with more va- riety of nodes and edges. But Facebook has a software in- terface that presents these options to you, and algorithms  behind  the  scenes  that  manage  your  network  for  you.  These are important features of Facebook, and an impor- tant point about networks in general: the more complex  the network, the more critical it is for computing to be in- volved in its management, and particularly in its analysis.  Robin Dunbar first found a correlation between the size   122     chaPter 5  10237.indb   122  9 25 15   10:41 AM   of primates’ brains and the size of those species’ average  social groups. Based on these findings, Dunbar proposed  that the maximum size of a human individual’s social com- munity—that  is,  the  number  of  people  with  whom  one  can maintain stable social relationships, and understand  everyone’s relationships with everyone else—is approxi- mately 150. Later researchers have debated this number,  but estimates do not go much higher than 250. In short,  humans can keep in mind a fairly large social network, as  long as we are embedded within that network—but ana- lyzing a larger network, or a network outside of one’s own  social sphere, requires computing.  This brings us back to General Hayden. The type of  metadata  he  was  referring  to,  the  metadata  that  we  kill  people based on, is exactly this type of data about individu- als and the networks in which they are embedded.  It’s difficult to get complete information about this.  Edward Snowden released a large number of classified doc- uments about the NSA’s surveillance program to the press,  but even so, not all of those documents are  as of this writ- ing  easily available for the average citizen to review. Still,  it’s possible to put together a decent understanding of the  intelligence community’s collection and use of metadata  from other sources.  The NSA collects metadata about phone calls, directly  from phone carriers. As discussed at the very beginning  of  this  book,  this  is  quite  a  lot  of  metadata:  the  phone      use Metadata      123  10237.indb   123  9 25 15   10:41 AM   numbers of the caller and the recipient, the time and dura- tion of the call, the locations of the caller and the recipi- ent, etc. If the NSA has reason to believe that a particular  phone number is associated with a “person of interest,” a  database of phone metadata can be queried, to identify the  numbers with which the phone of interest has had calls,  and the numbers with which those phones have had calls. Simply who calls whom is, of course, not sufficient for  any self-respecting intelligence analyst. But the network  of phone calls is a social network, which can be used to  enrich other social network data that the NSA presumably  also maintains. Entities  that is, nodes  in this social net- work include things like phone numbers, email addresses,  and  IP  addresses,  and  presumably  also  individuals,  geo- graphic  locations,  and  organizations  such  as  banks.  In  stories about the Snowden case, various news outlets have  reported that edges in this network include relationships  such as employs, travelsWith, and sentForumMessage. One  can imagine other labels for edges, such as calls, sent email  to, travels to, and visited.  What did General Hayden mean when he said that we  kill people based on metadata? Just this: that metadata  about a social network and an individual’s place in it, com- bined  with  metadata  about  an  individual’s  actions,  pro- vides enough information to justify taking military action  against that individual, according to the burden of proof  currently required by the US intelligence community.  124     chaPter 5  10237.indb   124  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Data Exhaust  On  the  one  hand,  this  sounds  terrifying.  On  the  other  hand, this is no different than what many organizations  do that we voluntarily interact with every day. Except for  the killing people part.  Amazon, for example, collects a great deal of metadata  about its users. In order to purchase anything on Amazon,  you must create a profile, which at a minimum includes a  credit card number and an address to ship items to. Ama- zon then captures additional data about you: what items  you  buy,  what  items  you  look  at,  any  reviews  that  you  write, etc. This is not unique to Amazon, of course; all on- line vendors collect similar types of data.  Aggregating  this  sort  of  data  over  time  can  allow  alarmingly  incisive  inferences  to  be  made.  Perhaps  the  most famous example of this is the case in which Target  predicted that a customer was most likely pregnant based  on her purchasing patterns, and sent her a flyer with cou- pons for baby-related items. This might have simply been  a good marketing strategy, had it not turned out that this  customer was a minor, and Target had just announced her  pregnancy to her parents, before she had.  The data that is produced—and that can therefore be  collected—as  one  goes  about  one’s  day-to-day  activities  is often referred to as “data exhaust.” This is a good term  for it, because the word exhaust captures the idea that this      use Metadata      125  10237.indb   125  9 25 15   10:41 AM   kind of data is the by-product of other processes. The fact  that  this  kind  of  data  is  separate  from  the  process  that  produced it lends itself to being called metadata—though  this is a slightly different definition than how the word has  been used throughout this book. Up to this point, “meta- data” has meant data that was created deliberately; data  exhaust, on the contrary, is produced incidentally as a re- sult of doing other things.  Paradata  When using online resources, data is produced incidentally  as a result simply of using those resources. Often this data  is in the form of web server logs. Web servers run software  that  generally  is  never  seen  by  users,  that  collects  data  about all of the activities performed by the server. One of  these types of activities is fulfilling requests for files on the  server: for example, to serve up webpages and the images  or other media that are embedded in them. These access  logs contain a great deal of information about the “client”  that made the request: the date and time of the request,  the application that issued the request  usually the type  and version of the web browser , the IP address of the cli- ent, even the identity of the user if a login was required.  Web server access logs are useful to enable a system  administrator to track the use and health of a server, but   126     chaPter 5  10237.indb   126  9 25 15   10:41 AM      The data that is pro- duced—and that can  therefore be collected— as one goes about one’s  day-to-day activities is  often referred to as  “data exhaust.”     use Metadata      127  10237.indb   127  9 25 15   10:41 AM   they are limited to descriptive data. Increasingly systems  are  therefore  being  designed  to  collect  specific  types  of  data about users’ use of a system. One area where this type  of use data is becoming increasingly important is in online  teaching and learning.  Paradata  is  a  relatively  new  term  for  use  metadata  about  learning  resources.  This  term  was  adopted  in  the  context of the National Science Digital Library  NSDL , as  a way to refer to data about users’ use of the digital learn- ing objects within the NSDL. The NSDL, originally a proj- ect of the US National Science Foundation, is a collection  of metadata about and links to high-quality online educa- tional resources, with a focus on the STEM disciplines: sci- ences, technology, engineering, and mathematics. These  resources are distributed across the web, on the websites of  such organizations as NASA, the Public Broadcasting Ser- vice  PBS , the American Museum of Natural History, and  many others with an educational mission. The NSDL is a  portal, providing search and browsing functionality across  these  many  diverse  collections,  to  enable  users  to  easily  find quality resources for STEM education.  The  NSDL  does  not  itself  host  any  educational  re- sources; all resources are hosted on other organizations’  websites.  The  NSDL  is  comprised  entirely  of  descriptive  metadata about educational resources and the organiza- tions that host them. In addition to this metadata, how- ever,  the  NSDL  also  collects  metadata  about  the  use  of  these resources: how often they are downloaded, tweeted   128     chaPter 5  10237.indb   128  9 25 15   10:41 AM   about,  included  in  other  collections,  used  in  curricula,  modified, and many other indicators of use. In its docu- mentation about paradata, the NSDL makes it clear that  paradata  is  intended  to  be  a  supplement  to,  and  not  a  replacement  for,  descriptive  metadata.  The  descriptive  metadata hosted by the NSDL aids users in searching and  browsing for educational resources; the paradata collected  by the NSDL provides feedback to the NSDL and partici- pating organizations about how, why, and by whom those  resources are being used.  As  of  this  writing,  the  NSDL  seems  to  be  the  only  organization  that  is  using  the  term  “paradata”  to  mean  “use  metadata  about  educational  resources.”  The  NSDL  is, however, certainly not the only organization to collect  paradata. Over the past few years, “dashboards” have be- come a common tool for the presentation of data about  websites and other online systems. Google Analytics, for  example,  is  a  well-known  system  for  collecting  detailed  use  data  about  websites.  Many  “learning  management  systems”—platforms  for  hosting  online  course  content  and discussions—collect data about students’ use of the  materials,  and  progress  through  the  course.  This  figure,  for example, shows some dashboard data from a massive  open online course  MOOC  about metadata that the au- thor taught through Coursera. Dashboards in some other  education platforms present even more finely grained user  data so that, for example, a teacher can identify individual      use Metadata      129  10237.indb   129  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Figure 12  students  who  may  be  falling  behind  their  classmates  as  well as specific lessons those students are having trouble  with.  Referring to use data as use metadata is a fairly new  development, and in fact slightly problematic. Collecting  data about the use of resources is, of course, nothing new:  web server software has included functionality to collect  logs for almost as long as web servers have existed. Prior  to the existence of web server logs, libraries collected data  about books checked out, museums collected data about  foot traffic through galleries, grocery stores collected data  about which items were purchased and with which other  items, etc. All of these are varieties of use data, but no one  refers to them as use metadata.  130     chaPter 5  10237.indb   130  9 25 15   10:41 AM   This  may  be  why  terms  such  as  “data  exhaust”  and  “paradata”  have  been  coined:  to  refer  to  use  data,  while  simultaneously making it clear that such data is separate  from the more traditional conception of metadata. “Data  exhaust” is a useful term, but it is not very widely used,  and it is not yet clear if the term “paradata” will come to  be widely used. It is clear, however, that use metadata is  a large and growing topic of interest, and that we are cur- rently seeing rapid change in this arena, as software is de- veloped to capture and analyze the wide variety of types of  use metadata. As this development progresses, there will  be an increasing need for clarity around terminology for  use metadata: in the context of web servers this data is  often called “logs,” in the context of other online resources  it is often called “analytics.” In the context of still other  services, it is often simply called “data.”     use Metadata      131  10237.indb   131  9 25 15   10:41 AM   10237.indb   132  9 25 15   10:41 AM   6  enabling teChnologies    for Metadata  chaPter 6  This chapter will address technologies that underlie much  of the metadata used on the web, and that underlies al- most all semantic web-related metadata. Up to this point,  only metadata schemas that already exist have been dis- cussed. It may seem entirely obvious that whatever schema  or thesaurus is being used, whether a metadata record is  embedded in or external to the resource, that schema or  thesaurus already exists. In this chapter, we will see how  metadata schemas are created in the first place.  The technologies that will be discussed in this chap- ter are complex, and deserve much longer treatments than  will be attempted here. There are, of course, many books  and online tutorials that provide these longer treatments,  and some of these are listed in the Further Readings sec- tion. This chapter will brush lightly over these technolo- gies, exploring them only insofar as is necessary to explain  their role in the creation of metadata schemas.  10237.indb   133  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Structured Data  Question: What kind of a message is this?  Lorem ipsum, Dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing  elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et  dolore magna aliqua.

Duis aute irure dolor in  reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu  fugiat nulla pariatur.  Answer: It’s impossible to tell; it’s not written in a way that  conveys any actual meaning. More important for our pur- poses here, it’s presented as an undifferentiated block of  text, so the formatting does not provide us with any clues.  Next question: What kind of a message is this?  Lorem ipsum, Dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do  eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna  aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud  exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea  commodo consequat.  Duis aute,  134     chaPter 6  10237.indb   134  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Answer: Again, the words are meaningless. But its format  suggests a letter, with a greeting at the top, the text of the  letter in the middle, and a sign-off at the end. It’s possible  to identify this text as a letter because it’s laid out on the  page in a familiar form.  Finally: What kind of a message is this?  Lorem: ipsum Dolor: sit amet Consectetur: adipisicing Elit: sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt Ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim  veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi  ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.  Answer: Its format suggests a memo or an email, with the  header at the top  To, From, Date, and Subject  and the  text of the email below. Once again, it’s possible to identify  this text because it’s laid out in a familiar form.  Formatting  is  useful  to  human  readers  who  have  learned what different genres of writing look like on the  page: because we are familiar with the genre of email mes- sages, we “see” the To, From, Date, and Subject lines in the  third text, above. Formatting can also be used by software  to automatically detect the genre of a text. In other words,  formatting is a form of structure, and this particular form  of structure helps us identify the category of a text, even  when the writing itself is meaningless.     enablIng technologIes for Metadata      135  10237.indb   135  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Text on a page has structure, as formatting. At a deeper  level, language itself has structure: different languages use  letters with different frequencies, different languages are  more or less flexible about word order, individual writers  have different styles of word use, etc. Thus any piece of  writing in a natural language has inherent structure. This  is of course why automatic tools for language translation   for example, Google Translate  and stylometry  author- ship  analysis,  for  example,  to  determine  if  Shakespeare  was the author of a particular piece of writing  are able to  work at all.  Of course, texts are not the only thing that has struc- ture. Indeed all data is structured. Only pure randomness  is unstructured, and then there’s an argument to be made  that pure randomness is noise, and not data anyway.  Text  in  natural  language—that  is,  writing  like  this,  intended for human consumption—is the classic example  of unstructured data. Yet, as just discussed, even natural  language  texts  have  some  structure,  such  as  formatting  and the statistical distribution of letters and words. Often  the unstructured data has structure embedded in it that  can be brought to light with some effort. Network analy- sis has already been discussed, and thanks to services such  as Facebook and Twitter, it’s commonly understood that  something as seemingly unstructured as a social network  has  a  great  deal  of  inherent  structure.  In  particular,  the  web, though it may be the most unstructured repository   136     chaPter 6  10237.indb   136  9 25 15   10:41 AM      All data is structured.     enablIng technologIes for Metadata      137  10237.indb   137  9 25 15   10:41 AM   of files in existence, displays structure when viewed at a  large scale.  Any and all data may be represented in a structured  fashion. This is what enables databases to exist. A database  allows a dataset to be decomposed into a set of statements,  and stored as a set of values assigned to a set of shared  fields. This should sound familiar. These statements have  in  fact  the  same  structure  as  subject-predicate-object  statements:  in  a  dataset  about  art  objects,  for  example,  the shared fields might include Title, Creator, and Date of  creation, and each individual record about a different art  object would assign different values to these fields. Such  a table is not a database but a spreadsheet—though, for  readability,  it’s  often  easier  to  represent  a  database  as  a  spreadsheet.  Another  way  to  represent  a  database  is  relationally.  In a relational database, a relationship may be established  between a field and a tabulated set of values, in order to  control what values can be assigned to that field. In other   Table 4  Creator Title Leonardo da Vinci La Gioconda L.H.O.O.Q. Marcel Duchamp  Eagle  Alexander Calder  Date of creation In the collection of 1503–1506 1919  Musée du Louvre Musée National d’Art  Moderne Seattle Art Museum  1971  138     chaPter 6  10237.indb   138  9 25 15   10:41 AM   words, the table that a field refers to becomes a controlled  vocabulary,  and  values  that  are  assigned  to  cells  in  that  field may only be assigned from that controlled vocabulary.  Relational databases are especially useful for ensuring data  quality: name authority files, for example, prevent names  from being misspelled, eliminate ambiguity about differ- ent  individuals  with  the  same  name,  etc.  Ensuring  data  quality is one of the primary functions of name authority  files, and one of the primary reasons why every entity in a  name authority file has a unique identifier.  Data  quality  is  an  especially  important  issue  where  metadata  records  for  resource  discovery  are  concerned.  Resources can be rendered essentially invisible due to poor   Figure 13     enablIng technologIes for Metadata      139  10237.indb   139  9 25 15   10:41 AM   data: if a value in a record is different than the term that  a user employs in a search—due to different terminology  being used, or simply due to a misspelling or other error— then that record may not be retrieved for that user’s search,  and that user may never discover a relevant resource.  The existence of metadata is partly predicated on the  existence of structured data. Structured data is organized  according to a data model, which is a representation of the  types of entities described by the data, the properties of  those entities, and the relationships between them. Again,  this should sound familiar. There are many data models  in existence, but the data model central to most metadata  work is RDF.  RDF  RDF, the Resource Description Framework, is a framework  for  describing  resources.  This,  to  be  fair,  is  a  tautology.  But it is actually more useful as a definition than tautolo- gies usually are. RDF is a data model: in other words, it’s  a framework, a logical structure according to which data  is  organized.  A  framework  for  what?  For  describing  re- sources.  What  resources?  Any  resources  at  all,  though  generally RDF is used to describe resources on the web. In  short, RDF is a generic data model for making descriptive  statements about entities.  140     chaPter 6  10237.indb   140  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Recall the 3-part subject-predicate-object relationship  discussed in chapter 2. This 3-part relationship is at the  heart of RDF, and is referred to as a triple. A set of RDF  triples is a graph, as discussed in the very brief foray into  network analysis, in chapter 2.  An important feature of RDF is that the subject of a  triple must be identified by a uniform resource identifier   URI , so that it can be referred to unambiguously in tri- ples or by online services. Say that Frédéric D. Vinci is a  photographer employed by the Louvre, who took a digital  photograph of the Mona Lisa, and that file is stored online.  The RDF triple representing that relationship would look  like figure 15.  Mssr. Vinci might himself have an identifier that can  be used as the canonical means to identify him online  the   Subject   Mona Lisa   Predicate   Creator   Object   da Vinci   Figure 14  Figure 15  http:  example  .org MonaLisa.tiff  Creator   Frédéric D. Vinci     enablIng technologIes for Metadata      141  10237.indb   141  9 25 15   10:41 AM   URL for his personal website, for example , and that rela- tionship would be another triple. Creator, of course, is a  Dublin Core element, and as such defined on the Dublin  Core website: another triple. Anything can be a resource,  and any resource identified by a URI may be the subject of  a triple. Thus RDF triples may “link up” to form graphs.  RDF is a framework for describing resources. But in  the arena of metadata, usually the resources and relation- ships of interest fall within a narrow domain: art objects,  music, resources on the web, etc. RDF is the framework  according to which most metadata schemas are built… ac- cording to which the types of entities, and relationships  between  those  entities,  that  exist  in  the  universe  of  a  metadata schema are defined.  DCMI Abstract Model  The  types  of  entities,  and  relationships  between  those  entities, that exist in the universe of Dublin Core, for ex- ample, are defined in the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative  Abstract Model, which is built on RDF.  While the DCMI Abstract Model is the framework on  which the Dublin Core metadata schema is built, it was de- veloped to be more broadly applicable than just the Dublin  Core. The DCMI Abstract Model was in fact developed to  be a universal abstract model for metadata schemas. Even   142     chaPter 6  10237.indb   142  9 25 15   10:41 AM   though it’s called the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Ab- stract Model, it was developed to be independent of any  specific syntax or semantics for encoding entities and re- lationships. In short, the DCMI Abstract Model was devel- oped to be a generic model: the model on which Dublin  Core is built, and a model on which any metadata schema  may be built.  Why  develop  a  generic  abstract  model?  Because  do- ing so actually increases Dublin Core’s usefulness. Recall  that the Dublin Core element set was created to be a lowest  common denominator: so simple to use that everyone not  only could, but would use it. The trade-off for this radical  simplicity, however, is that Dublin Core would not be suf- ficient for every use case. The developers of Dublin Core  understood this, and understood that the ability to extend  Dublin Core was necessary for its success. Qualifiers were  developed as the mechanism for extending Dublin Core:  enabling elements to be refined  Date.Created, Date.Modi- fied, etc.  and entirely new elements to be developed  the  elements continent, country, island, etc. from the Darwin  Core . The fact that Dublin Core can be used as a foun- dation, and easily built on using a generic abstract model,  promotes the use of Dublin Core, which in turn promotes  the outcome for which Dublin Core was originally devel- oped: “to advance the state of the art in the development of  resource description  or metadata  records for networked  electronic information objects.”     enablIng technologIes for Metadata      143  10237.indb   143  9 25 15   10:41 AM   This “modular” approach to developing metadata sche- mas is possible when all schemas recognize the existence  of the same types of entities and relationships. As a nega- tive example, Dublin Core recognizes Creator as an entity  primarily responsible for the creation of a resource, while  the W3C’s provenance schema recognizes Agent as an en- tity that has any influence in the life cycle of the resource.  Not only do these entities have different names, but they  are  conceptualized  differently  and  incompatibly.  This  is  a basic problem of ontology  in the philosophical sense :  communication is a challenge when the parties don’t rec- ognize the same categories of entity in the universe. The  DCMI Abstract Model is fundamentally a mechanism for  pinning down the ontology of metadata schemas.  The  DCMI  Abstract  Model  pins  down  the  ontology  of metadata schemas in a way that will be familiar. The  described resource is the subject of an RDF triple  for ex- ample, the Mona Lisa . The described resource is described  using a property-value pair. A property-value pair is com- posed of exactly one property and exactly one value  for  example, the creator is Leonardo da Vinci . There are two  types of values: literal and nonliteral. A nonliteral value is  an entity, and a literal value is a string of characters that  represents that entity  for example, the name Leonardo da  Vinci  is  a  literal  value  that  represents  the  nonliteral,  ac- tual person who went by that name . Both the described  resource and the nonliteral value are resources. In other   144     chaPter 6  10237.indb   144  9 25 15   10:41 AM   words, any entity that can be described, can be the subject  of an RDF triple.  There is more to the DCMI Abstract Model: the model  also describes how metadata records are constructed, how  unique identifiers stand in for entities, and how resources  are  described  by  encoding  schemes.  But  this  diagram  is  enough to convey the point that the generic model on which  any metadata schema can be built, is itself built on the logic  of  RDF.  RDF  articulates  the  structure  of  triples  and  net- works of triples. The DCMI Abstract Model explores that  structure in more detail, but it makes use of that structure.  XML  This is where XML enters the picture. It was mentioned  above that the DCMI Abstract Model, as a generic model,   Resource  Described  using  Described resource  Property–value  pair  Value  Property  1  1  Figure 16  Literal value  Nonliteral  value     enablIng technologIes for Metadata      145  10237.indb   145  9 25 15   10:41 AM   does not specify any specific syntax or semantics for encod- ing the entities and relationships in a metadata schema.  In  practice,  however,  the  syntax  and  semantics  of  many  metadata schemas are encoded in XML.  Even  though  this  section  is  titled  XML,  it  will  start  with HTML, the HyperText Markup Language. A markup  language is not truly a language but rather a controlled vo- cabulary that allows instructions to be embedded in the  text of a document, so that there is a clear separation of the  text and the instructions. HTML is designed to be embed- ded in  as you might expect  hypertext documents: that  is, documents on the web. And what makes the web a web  is that documents may contain hyperlinks: thus the docu- ments may be considered nodes and the links edges.  The instructions that HTML conveys are mostly con- cerned with formatting: this text is bold, this is italic, this  is a heading, this is a link, etc. Your web browser interprets  these instructions, so that the webpage you see is format- ted as the creator of that webpage intended. HTML is meta- data only in the sense that it describes the formatting of a  document. We need not get into HTML any further, but if  you’re curious what this markup looks like, see the    tag example from chapter 3, or this simple example:   This text is a heading   146     chaPter 6  10237.indb   146  9 25 15   10:41 AM    This text is bold    This text is a link   XML stands for the Extensible Markup Language.  And no,  extensible doesn’t start with the letter X. What can I tell  you?  Again, XML is not a language but a set of instruc- tions. However, where HTML is a set of instructions for  specifying  the  formatting  of  a  web  document,  XML  is  a  set of instructions for specifying other markup languages. In  chapter  2  we  invoked  language  as  a  metaphor:  a  metadata schema is a simple, structured language, and a  metadata record is a set of statements made in that lan- guage. This is a useful metaphor, but like any metaphor, it  can’t be pushed too far… and XML is where this particular  metaphor breaks down. XML is a structured language in  which you can create other structured languages—an idea  that simply doesn’t make sense when talking about human  languages.  It  makes  sense  when  talking  about  XML,  though.  You can, for example, create HTML in XML. This has in  fact  been  done,  and  is  called  XHTML.  HTML5,  the  lat- est  version  of  HTML  as  of  this  writing,  is  also  built  on  XML—though previous versions of HTML were built on  a  different  markup  language,  the  Standard  Generalized  Markup Language  SGML .     enablIng technologIes for Metadata      147  10237.indb   147  9 25 15   10:41 AM   DTD  Your web browser interprets the HTML in a webpage, and  displays the contents of that page: this text is bold, this  italic, etc. But how does your web browser know how to  interpret HTML? How does it know that   means “make  this text bold,” and not anything else?  The  answer  is  a  document  type  definition   DTD .  A  DTD is a document that declares and defines all of the ele- ments that exist in a markup language. Different versions  of HTML have different DTDs. But, since the elements in  HTML  are  fairly  stable  across  versions,  these  DTDs  are  fairly similar. A DTD for a version of HTML therefore con- tains definitions for all the markup elements that exist in  that version of HTML. For example, the declarations for  headings and font styles in the DTD for HTML 4.01 are as  follows:        All  6  levels  of  heading,  and  all  font  styles   teletype  or  monospaced, italic, bold, etc.  are declared in these DTD  statements.  The  definitions  of  heading  and  fontstyle  are  declared elsewhere in the DTD.  148     chaPter 6  10237.indb   148  9 25 15   10:41 AM   This is a simple example from the DTD for HTML. But  the beauty of DTDs is that they can be used to define ele- ments for any markup language. The Dublin Core meta- data element set, for example, is also declared in a DTD.  The following line declares all 15 elements:  < !ENTITY % dcmes “dc:title  dc:creator  dc:subject   dc:description  dc:publisher  dc:contributor   dc:date  dc:type  dc:format  dc:identifier   dc:source  dc:language  dc:relation  dc:coverage   dc:rights” >  And then these lines declare the title element in detail:           Briefly,  the  element  title  requires  data  of  a  particu- lar type  Parsed Character Data , and the attributes  AT- TLIST  of title are derived from XML and RDF, and must  be of a different data type  Character Data .  It is not necessary to delve further here into the cre- ation of a DTD. As mentioned above, some resources that  provide  more  detail  are  listed  in  the  Further  Readings      enablIng technologIes for Metadata      149  10237.indb   149  9 25 15   10:41 AM   section, below. These very simple examples nevertheless  show that it is possible to declare any element in a DTD.  A DTD that declares multiple elements therefore declares  an entire markup language—an entire metadata schema. It is also not necessary to delve further into DTDs be- cause DTDs are becoming less common. Because HTML5 is  not built on SGML, elements in HTML5 are not declared in  a DTD. Instead, HTML5 elements are declared in a Docu- ment Object Model  DOM , which contains all elements  that exist in HTML5, organized in a hierarchical tree struc- ture. All modern web browsers contain functionality to re- fer to this DOM, and thus interpret the elements used in  an HTML document. Thus at a very high level a DTD and a  DOM may be considered to be analogous, as both declare  the elements and the attributes of elements in a markup  language. As of this writing, Dublin Core has not yet been  revised, or a new version of Dublin Core developed, to ac- commodate this trend of DTD-lessness.  To conclude: All data is structured, and it is useful to  keep the basics of database design in mind when thinking  about the creation of metadata schemas. RDF allows the  structure of a dataset to be articulated as a graph of triples.  Entities may be both the subject and the object of mul- tiple triples, which allows the graph to grow. A relation- ship between entities—the predicate—is the equivalent of  a column header in a spreadsheet: a category of statement  that can be made about that relationship. The terms that   150     chaPter 6  10237.indb   150  9 25 15   10:41 AM   may be used to specify the object of a triple may be derived  from a thesaurus. The syntax and semantics of the set of  relationships, and the way in which thesaurus terms are  specified, is specified using XML DTDs.  This chapter addressed a set of technologies that un- derlie much of the metadata on the web. A set of technolo- gies used together to enable a specific set of functionalities  is often referred to as a technology stack. The technology  stack discussed in this chapter is in fact part of the World  Wide  Web  Consortium   W3C   technology  stack  for  the  web—but only part. RDF and XML appear at the base of  the W3C stack. Building on that base are technologies for  mobile, voice, and other web services that are beyond the  scope  here.  Also  building  on  that  base  are  technologies  that rely on metadata: specifically, the semantic web.     enablIng technologIes for Metadata      151  10237.indb   151  9 25 15   10:41 AM   10237.indb   152  9 25 15   10:41 AM   7  the seMantiC  web  chaPter 7  If suitable terms can be found in existing vocabularies,  these should be reused to describe data wherever  possible, rather than reinvented. Reuse of existing terms  is highly desirable. —Tom Heath and Christian Bizer  2011 , Linked Data: Evolving the Web into a  Global Data Space  Not content with merely inventing the World Wide Web,  Tim Berners-Lee later went on to articulate a vision of a  “web of data.” This data would, of course, be consumable  by human users of the web, as the current web is. But this  data would also be capable of being processed by software,  so that applications could perform tasks on behalf of users.  Berners-Lee and colleagues wrote in 2006 that their vision  was then unrealized, and it remains so today.  We  are,  however,  getting  closer  to  realizing  this  vi- sion, as various standards, technologies, and other tools   10237.indb   153  9 25 15   10:41 AM   emerge that enable it. Many of these tools are metadata  schemas  and  vocabularies,  and  the  technologies  that  these are built on.  The semantic web is a complex subject, in terms of the  technology that it encompasses. Some of these technolo- gies are metadata-related technologies, but many are not.  However, this is a book about metadata, not a book about  web-related  technologies  generally.  Consequently,  in  or- der to focus on what is specifically related to metadata, the  same caveat from the start of the previous chapter also ap- plies here: this chapter will brush lightly over lots of tech- nologies that are involved in the semantic web, exploring  these only insofar as is necessary to explain the metadata  aspects, and some longer treatments of these topics will be  listed in the Further Readings section.  Introduction to the Semantic Web  Metadata is not all there is to the semantic web, but meta- data is a critical part of the operation of the semantic web.  In order to understand how metadata fits in to the seman- tic  web,  it  is  first  necessary  to  understand  the  vision  of  the semantic web and what problem the semantic web is  attempting to solve.  In the original 2001 article in which a vision of the se- mantic web is laid out, Berners-Lee and colleagues state   154     chaPter 7  10237.indb   154  9 25 15   10:41 AM   that the semantic web “will bring structure to the mean- ingful content” of the web, and that software agents will  be able to use this structure to “readily carry out sophisti- cated tasks for users”  p. 36 .  As discussed in the previous chapter, all data is struc- tured to some extent. However, not all structure is acces- sible to algorithms. The statistical structure of the English  language,  for  example,  may  be  analyzed  algorithmically,  which is how stylometry works… but this sort of structure  is implicit, which opens up room for debate about whether  Shakespeare was in fact the author of A Funeral Elegy for  Master  William  Peter   current  consensus  among  literary  scholars is that he is not . In order for software agents to  be able to readily carry out sophisticated tasks for users,  data on the web must be explicitly structured.  Software Agents  The idea of the software agent has been somewhat co-opted  by the image of Agent Smith, from the movie The Matrix.  While many of us might enjoy having our computers speak  in Hugo Weaving’s voice, Agent Smith is not what Berners- Lee and colleagues meant by “software agent.” Rather, the  semantic web vision of a software agent is more akin to  email filters than to a malicious rogue computer program  bent on subjugating all of humanity.     the seMantIc Web      155  10237.indb   155  9 25 15   10:41 AM   In their original article Berners-Lee and colleagues use  the scheduling of a series of medical appointments as an  example of the sort of tasks that software agents should  be able to perform in a semantic web-enabled future. In  this example, your agent retrieves data from your doctor’s  agent about the prescribed treatment, then finds lists of  providers,  checks  which  are  covered  by  your  insurance,  which have acceptably high ratings, filters by their distance  from your home, and finally interacts with the providers’  agents  to  schedule  appointments  at  times  that  fit  into  your calendar.  In  order  for  this  example  to  work  in  reality,  several  pieces of data would have to be provided by several enti- ties: the treatment and details thereof from your doctor’s  office; a list of covered providers from your insurance com- pany; ratings from the providers themselves or from some  third party; calendars from the providers; your home ad- dress, and a personal calendar from you.  The calendar is perhaps the simplest part of this ex- ample. As discussed previously, ISO 8601 is a standard for  representing dates and times, so assume that all calendars  in this example are encoded according to ISO 8601. Events  on your calendar will have dates and times associated with  them,  so  your  calendar  agent  can  search  for  dates  and  times with no associated event, and share that list of dates  and times with another agent.  156     chaPter 7  10237.indb   156  9 25 15   10:41 AM   It is not necessary for your calendar agent to share your  entire calendar, or any of the events on your calendar. All  that is necessary for your agent to share is some metadata  about your calendar: the set of dates and times for which  there are no associated events. In this example, software  agents are not truly making use of the “meaningful con- tent” of the web: they are not passing digital resources back  and forth. Instead, software agents are passing metadata  about those resources back and forth. In other words, this  vision of the semantic web relies on software agents us- ing the structure imposed by metadata on the meaningful  content of the web.  Introduction to Linked Data  The semantic web requires more than putting structured  data online; it requires creating links between the struc- tured data. The fact that links exist between webpages is  what makes it a web. Similarly it is links between struc- tured data online that enables software to make connec- tions between datasets.  In their book on linked data, Tom Heath and Chris- tian Bizer state that “the basic idea of Linked Data is to  apply the general architecture of the World Wide Web to  the task of sharing structured data on global scale.” While      the seMantIc Web      157  10237.indb   157  9 25 15   10:41 AM   the web is a complex information space, that complexity  arises from a fairly simple set of rules. These rules were  proposed by Berners-Lee, in which he articulates a set of  design principles for the web. Berner-Lee’s rules are not  requirements,  but  suggestions,  for  how  data  should  be  structured—though adhering to these rules ensures that  new  technologies  for  the  web  will  be  interoperable  with  existing  infrastructure.  Adhering  to  these  rules  also  en- sures that structured data on the web can be linked. To  paraphrase these rules:  1.  Use URIs as identifiers for resources.  2.  Format URIs according to HTTP, so that resources can  be found easily, using established technology.  3.  Use  standards  such  as  RDF  to  provide  both  the  re- source and metadata about the resource.  4.  Provide links along with this metadata to other URIs,  so that more resources can be found.  All of the technologies invoked by these rules have already  been  addressed  in  previous  chapters.  A  URI  is  a  unique  identifier for a resource online. The semantic web requires  that a resource have a URI, so that it can be referred to  unambiguously by other resources or online services. A re- source that’s accessible at a URI is called “dereferenceable.”   158     chaPter 7  10237.indb   158  9 25 15   10:41 AM   HTTP  is  the  preferred  mechanism  for  referring  to  URIs  because it is the most common protocol on the web, and  therefore allows URIs to be dereferenced by a wide range  of software and services. When the resource at a URI is  a webpage, for example, and that URI is dereferenced by  a web browser, what’s passed back to the browser is that  webpage. The vision of linked data is that any type of re- source can be dereferenceable by software, and that what’s  passed back to the querying agent is not just the resource,  but also metadata about that resource.  RDF  is  a  framework  for  describing  resources,  mak- ing  use  of  subject-predicate-object  triples.  The  resource  described by the triple  the subject  is uniquely identified  by a URI, making it possible for that resource to be deref- erenced. The object in the triple is also a resource and is  likewise dereferenceable, creating a relationship between  two  uniquely  identified  resources.  When  a  resource  is  dereferenced, the resource itself is provided to the query- ing application, along with any metadata records that exist  about that resource. Included in that metadata is a list of  other resources to which the original resource is linked: the  objects in any triples of which the resource is the subject,  and any other resources that are the subject of triples in  which the original resource is the object. If a user were to  query a semantic web search engine for the Mona Lisa, for  example, a digital image of the Mona Lisa and descriptive      the seMantIc Web      159  10237.indb   159  9 25 15   10:41 AM   metadata about it might be provided, along with links to  further data about Leonardo da Vinci, Lisa del Giocondo,  and the Louvre Museum: in short, data to help the user put  the resource in context.  Europeana has created an excellent video about linked  open data and its uses. Europeana is a portal to cultural  heritage materials in the collections of  as of this writing   almost 150 “memory institutions” of various types  gal- leries, libraries, archives, museums, etc. , across the Euro- pean Union. The digitized resources themselves are hosted  by the providing institutions; what Europeana provides is  shared  mechanisms  for  users  to  access  those  resources.  The example provided in this video is of a search for “Ve- nus.” What is the user searching for: the planet, the god- dess, the tennis player Venus Williams, the Venus de Milo,  the  Botticelli  painting  The  Birth  of  Venus?  By  providing  linked open data about these resources, cultural heritage  institutions enable the creation of tools that can disambig- uate this search to help the user. For this search the search  tool  dereferences  resources  matching  the  term  “Venus,”  and provides these to the user. Along with these resources  comes metadata about the resources, and links to other re- sources that provide context. From this additional contex- tual information, the user who conducted the search will  be able to identify the many meanings of the term “Venus”  and decide which is the most relevant.  160     chaPter 7  10237.indb   160  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Everything Is Connected  The  predicate  in  an  RDF  triple  is  what  puts  the  link  in  Linked Data. Any resource can be either the Subject or the  Object of a triple: Leonardo da Vinci  subject  was born  in  predicate  the town of Vinci  object , for example, but  Vinci   subject   is  a  part  of   predicate   Firenze  Province   object .  When  resources  are  dereferenceable,  a  network  of triples between resources is created. It is this network of  triples that makes linked data linked, that gives structure  to the web of data, and that makes it possible for software  agents to use this structure to carry out tasks. Linked data  is a way of structuring data on the web so that it’s  1  struc- tured enough to be useful by software and  2  uses shared  standards that can connect data from one provider with  data from other providers.  It has been 15 years since Berners-Lee and colleagues  wrote their original article about the semantic web, and  software agents have not emerged quite as they envisioned.  Instead of semi-autonomous agents interacting with web  services,  web  services  mostly  interact  directly  with  each  other, serving and ingesting structured data via applica- tion programming interfaces  APIs . What metadata is be- ing served and ingested by these APIs? The answer to that  question, of course, depends on the application. But it may  be anything and everything.     the seMantIc Web      161  10237.indb   161  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Calendars  provide  a  good  example.  The  websites  of  many organizations for which events play a significant role   schools, theaters, etc.  provide an iCalendar feed. These  are common on the web, and often appear as a URL with the  extension .ics, usually accompanied by a calendar-shaped  icon.  The  iCalendar  standard  encodes  event  metadata,  using  elements  such  as  start  and  end  time,  a  summary,  contact information for the event organizer. An iCalendar  feed is a URL; many calendar applications allow that feed  URL to be added to the calendar, which will then display  all events encoded in that feed. Because the feed is a URL,  it may be updated by the provider. Thus, if I subscribe to  the iCalendar feed for the Boston Red Sox, for example, my  personal calendar will always include the Sox’s schedule.  Another good example of metadata being served and  ingested via APIs is Exif data available from photo hosting  services. Recall the projects I Know Where Your Cat Lives and  Photosynth, from chapter 4: these services query the APIs  of photo hosting services such as Flickr and Instagram for  photos that match certain criteria  the photo contains a  cat, or a specific landmark , and that contain GPS data in  the Exif record. The API for a map application is then used  to import this GPS data, and place these photos on a map. There is no restriction to what can be put on the web.  This is both the good and the bad of the web: on the one  hand, you do not need permission to start a website or a  blog or a Tumblr or a Pinterest board on whatever esoteric   162     chaPter 7  10237.indb   162  9 25 15   10:41 AM   topic you happen to be interested in. On the other hand,  someone out there has almost certainly started a website  or  a  blog  or  a  Tumblr  or  a  Pinterest  board  on  whatever  topic you find most offensive. There are organizations that  control certain aspects of the web—the Internet Corpora- tion for Assigned Names and Numbers  ICANN  oversees  the Domain Name System  DNS , for example—but no or- ganization exerts control over the content that may be put  up  online.  Of  course,  some  organizations,  such  as  some  authoritarian governments, attempt to exert control over  what users can access. And search engines exert de facto  control over what users can access, by making resources  more or less visible in lists of search results. But both of  these are filters after the fact, not control over what is put  online in the first place.  Likewise there is no restriction to what metadata can  put on the web. This is as it should be, since the possible  number of statements that may be made about a resource  is nearly infinite.  Linked Data for Art  The types of statements that are in fact made about a re- source, however, tend to be limited, as the scope of indi- vidual metadata schemas tends to be domain specific. The  domain of art makes a good example here, as it is quite      the seMantIc Web      163  10237.indb   163  9 25 15   10:41 AM   broad and encompasses many different types of entities  and relationships.  The work of the J. Paul Getty Research Institute has al- ready been mentioned. The Getty Institute has in fact devel- oped four vocabularies to describe material culture: the Art  & Architecture Thesaurus  AAT ®, the Thesaurus of Geo- graphic Names  TGN ®, the Cultural Objects Name Author- ity  CONA ®, and the Union List of Artist Names  ULAN ®.  Note that the AAT and TGN are both thesauri, and therefore  have a hierarchical structure, like the figure accompanying  the  example  of  parent–child  relationships  for  Seattle  in  chapter 2. CONA and ULAN are both name authority files. The Getty vocabularies predate the idea of linked data:  AAT, the oldest of the four, dates to the 1970s. Given their  domain-specific scope, however, these vocabularies natu- rally lend themselves to being interconnected. As of this  writing, the CONA hierarchy is still in pilot release, and  the Mona Lisa is not yet included online. But another Leon- ardo da Vinci piece is currently online: Caricature of a Man  with Bushy Hair, CONA ID number 700002067. The CONA  record for this object includes several elements for which  the values come from other Getty thesauri. The Work Type,  for example, is drawing, AAT ID 300033973, and the dis- play materials are pen and ink, AAT IDs 300022452 and  300015012,  respectively.  The  creator  of  this  work  is,  of  course, Leonardo da Vinci, who naturally is an entity in  ULAN, ID 500010879. This work is in the collection of the   164     chaPter 7  10237.indb   164  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Getty Center, ULAN ID 500260314, but it apparently used  to reside in England, TGN ID 7002445.  Each  ID  number  mentioned  above  is  a  unique  iden- tifier. The Getty Research Institute has created a unique  identifier for every entity in all four of their thesauri. The  Getty is a prominent player in the art world, and it has ded- icated significant effort to developing these thesauri and  other standards related to art. Many museums and other  cultural heritage organizations therefore use the Getty’s  products. It is important nevertheless to note that these  IDs are assigned by Getty. A URI is inherent in a resource  once it’s on the web, but Getty’s unique identifiers are arbi- trary, assigned according to whatever mechanism has been  developed by the Getty, though nevertheless widely used.  In turn these IDs correspond to a URI on the Getty’s serv- ers: the TGN ID 7002445, for example, corresponds to the  URI  http:  vocab.getty.edu tgn 7002445.  At  that  URI  is  to be found a record containing a table of predicate-object  pairs, all of which are two parts of triples with England as  their subject  for example, the predicate placeType and the  object countries  sovereign states  .  Every  entity  in  the  Getty  vocabularies  has  a  unique  identifier, from which a URI is created. Every entity record  may  connect  to  any  number  of  other  entity  records,  via  these unique identifiers. As a result the Getty vocabularies  are tightly interconnected, as the example of Leonardo’s  Caricature of a Man with Bushy Hair demonstrates.     the seMantIc Web      165  10237.indb   165  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Even more important is the fact that a record from any  thesaurus or metadata schema may connect to entity re- cords in the Getty vocabularies, via these unique identifi- ers. Similarly any entity record that has a unique identifier,  in any thesaurus or metadata schema, may be connected  to.  The  Library  of  Congress,  for  example,  provides  their  Subject Headings and Name Authority File, as well as sev- eral other vocabularies, via The Library of Congress Linked  Data Service—in which every entity of course has a unique  identifier,  corresponding  to  a  URI.   The  URI  for  Leon- ardo  da  Vinci,  for  example,  ishttp:  id.loc.gov authori- ties names n79034525.html.   The  Virtual  International  Authority File  VIAF  was discussed briefly in chapter 2:  VIAF is an authority file that combines records from mul- tiple sources into a single service. The sources of VIAF re- cords include, among others, the Library of Congress and  the Getty Research Institute; VIAF records list all of the  sources from which data was compiled, with links back to  the original records. Every VIAF record, of course, has a  unique identifier corresponding to a URI  the VIAF URI for  Leonardo da Vinci ishttp:  viaf.org viaf 24604287 .  Recall  the  One-to-One  Principle,  discussed  in  chap- ter 2: there should be one and only one metadata record  for a single resource, for a single metadata schema. The  “for a single metadata schema” part is important. No less  than three records for Leonardo da Vinci have been men- tioned in this section alone. Each of these records serves a   166     chaPter 7  10237.indb   166  9 25 15   10:41 AM   different purpose, however: one of the primary purposes  of the Library of Congress Name Authority File is to pro- vide a controlled form of names, while the Union List of  Artist  Names  provides  not  just  names  but  biographical  and other information. VIAF combines data from multiple  sources into one record, to reduce the cost and increase the  usefulness of authority files. While multiple records for a  single resource may exist, all of these serve a dual function:  to be a definitive record that can be dereferenced by an ap- plication or service, and to provide further links to related  resources that can themselves be dereferenced.  DBpedia  Enter DBpedia. As the name indicates, the DBpedia data- set is derived from the content of Wikipedia. Wikipedia  natively contains a great deal of structured data  beyond  the structure of language and the layout on the page , in- cluding links, GPS data, and categories. Perhaps the most  visible structured data in Wikipedia, however, is the Info- box: the sidebar in the upper right corner of many Wiki- pedia  articles,  containing  summary  information  about  the  subject  of  the  article.  The  Infobox  about  Leonardo  da  Vinci,  for  example,  contains  the  element  Style,  with  the  value  “High  Renaissance,”  and  the  element  Notable  work s , with multiple values. This Infobox also contains      the seMantIc Web      167  10237.indb   167  9 25 15   10:41 AM   the element Born, with three implied elements: birth name,  birth date, and place of birth, each with appropriate values.  A great deal more data could be extracted from the text  of the Wikipedia article about Leonardo da Vinci, but it  would require processing to structure it usefully, where the  data in the Infobox is already structured.  A single Wikipedia article corresponds to a single en- tity  a person, place, thing, or idea . There can, of course,  be debate about what constitutes “a single entity,” which is  why Wikipedia articles split and merge over time. But the  ebb and flow of articles notwithstanding, there is a DB- pedia entry corresponding to every entity with an article  in, as of this writing, 125 different language versions of  Wikipedia, for a total of over 38 million entries.  A  DBpedia  entry  is  a  metadata  record  for  an  entity,  containing a large set of elements and values. Not every  record will contain the same elements, of course: a record  for an individual will contain a birthplace and birth date,  for example, while a record for a city would not. Moreover  a record for a city might contain the element birthplace of,  and a list of individuals who were born there, while that  would not be included in records for other types of enti- ties. A single DBpedia entry may not contain all, but will  certainly contain a great deal of, the data about an entity  that could be extracted from all the language versions of  Wikipedia. So, for example, the entry on Leonardo da Vinci  contains not only his name, places, and dates of his birth   168     chaPter 7  10237.indb   168  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Figure 17  10237.indb   169  9 25 15   10:41 AM   and death, and notable works, but also artists who influ- enced him, ships named after him, and works of fiction in  which he appears.  The  formation  of  networks  from  subject-predicate- object  triples  has  been  explored  previously:  the  subject   Leonardo da Vinci  is the resource being described, a cat- egory of relationship between the resource and some other  entity is the predicate  for example, birthplace , and the  object  is  the  entity  that  has  the  predicated  relationship  with the resource  for example, Vinci . Leonardo da Vinci  is the subject of further triples and the object of others,  Vinci is itself both the subject and object of other triples,  ad infinitum. In this way, were we so inclined, we could  map out the network of relationships between everything  in the entire universe.  Of course, even Wikipedia is finite. So, in using Wiki- pedia to map out a network of relationships between en- tities, eventually one would reach the edge of the known  universe, so to speak.  Enter the sameAs element. Every DBpedia entry con- tains  the  sameAs  element,  and  list  of  associated  values,  which are the URIs of other records about the same en- tity. Many of these are DBpedia entries in other languages,  but some are from different sources, such as the Wikidata  database, the New York Times’ linked open data vocabu- lary, or the Cyc vocabulary. The sameAs element indicates  that all URIs listed dereference records that refer to the   170     chaPter 7  10237.indb   170  9 25 15   10:41 AM   Property dbpedia-owl: abstract  Value Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci  Italian pronunciation: [leo’nardo da v’vint∫i] About this sound  pronunciation ; April 15, 1452 – May 2, 1519, Old Style  was an Italian Renaissance polymath:  painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist,  cartographer, botanist, and writer. His genius, perhaps more than that of any other ﬁgure,  epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal.Leonardo has often been described as the  archetype of the Renaissance Man, a man of "unquenchable curiosity" and "feverishly  inventive imagination". He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time  and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived. According to art historian  Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent and "his mind  and personality seem to us superhuman, the man himself mysterious and remote. Marco  Rosci states that while there is much speculation about Leonardo, his vision of the world is  essentially logical rather than mysterious, and that the empirical methods he employed were  unusual for his time.Born out of wedlock to a notary, Piero da Vinci, and a peasant woman,  Caterina, in Vinci in the region of Florence, Leonardo was educated in the studio of the  renowned Florentine painter Verrocchio. Much of his earlier working life was spent in the  service of Ludovico il Moro in Milan. He later worked in Rome, Bologna and Venice, and he  spent his last years in France at the home awarded him by Francis I. Leonardo was, and is,  renowned primarily as a painter. Among his works, the Mona Lisa is the most famous and  most parodied portrait and The Last Supper the most reproduced religious painting of all time,  with their fame approached only by Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. Leonardo's  drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon, being reproduced on items as  varied as the euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts. Perhaps ﬁfteen of his paintings have survived,  the small number because of his constant, and frequently disastrous, experimentation with  new techniques, and his chronic procrastination. Nevertheless, these few works, together with  his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientiﬁc diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of  painting, compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his  contemporary, Michelangelo. Leonardo is revered for his technological ingenuity. He  conceptualised ﬂying machines, a tank, concentrated solar power, an adding machine, and the  double hull, also outlining a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics. Relatively few of his  designs were constructed or were even feasible during his lifetime, but some of his smaller  inventions, such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile  strength of wire, entered the world of manufacturing unheralded. He made important  discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, optics, and hydrodynamics, but he did not publish  his ﬁndings and they had no direct inﬂuence on later science.

Or, perhaps a better  example, as a 10-digit and a 13-digit ISBN number are both  understood to refer to the same published book.  The sameAs element is what enables a network of re- lationships between entities to extend not just to the edge  of what Wikipedia knows about but to the edge of human  knowledge. There is sure to be overlap in the content of  different language versions of Wikipedia. But it is prob- ably safe to say that there are topics that are covered in one  language version of Wikipedia and not covered in another.  As  of  this  writing,  for  example,  the  entry  on  Leonardo  da Vinci in the Italian language Wikipedia contains a far   owl:sameas  fbase:Leonardo da Vinci http:  purl.org collections nl am p-10456 http:  fr.dbpedia.org resource Léonard_de_Vinci http:  de.dbpedia.org resource Leonardo_da_Vinci http:  cs.dbpedia.org resource Leonardo_da_Vinci http:  el.dbpedia.org resource Λεονάρντο_ντα_Βίντσι http:  es.dbpedia.org resource Leonardo_da_Vinci http:  eu.dbpedia.org resource Leonardo_da_Vinci http:  id.dbpedia.org resource Leonardo_da_Vinci http:  it.dbpedia.org resource Leonardo_da_Vinci http:  ja.dbpedia.org resource cid:45  cid:620  cid:554  cid:586  cid:619  cid:585  cid:258  cid:576  cid:258  cid:628  cid:547  cid:627  cid:577  http:  ko.dbpedia.org resource 레오나르도 cid:93 다 cid:93 빈치 http:  nl.dbpedia.org resource Leonardo_da_Vinci http:  pl.dbpedia.org resource Leonardo_da_Vinci http:  pt.dbpedia.org resource Leonardo_da_Vinci http:  wikidata.org entity Q762 http:  wikidata.dbpedia.org resource Q762 http:  www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de gutendata resource people Leonardo_da_Vinci_1452-1519 http:  sw.cyc.com concept Mx4rwAvMqZwpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA http:  yago-knowledge.org resource Leonardo_da_Vinci  Figure 19  172     chaPter 7  10237.indb   172  9 25 15   10:41 AM   more extensive biography than exists in the English lan- guage Wikipedia, as well as sections on Leonardo’s library  and manuscripts, which are entirely absent in the English  language article. Once it is established that the Italian lan- guage Wikipedia article and the English language Wikipe- dia article are about the same entity, however, two isolated  networks may be linked together. And the longer the list  of URIs associated as values for the sameAs element, the  more data from more networks can be linked.  Linked Open Data  This is, of course, why many organizations have made their  datasets available as linked open data: because the more re- cords about more entities that can be connected together,  the richer the knowledge represented online can be.  What makes linked open data open is that an organi- zation will publish a dataset on the web, using the struc- ture of RDF triples within the dataset, as well as between  entities within and external to the dataset. Organizations  can of course use RDF triples in proprietary datasets, and  leverage other organizations’ efforts. But many organiza- tions recognize that publishing their dataset openly, and  thus expanding the growing network of linked open datas- ets, benefits them. A rising tide lifts all boats.     the seMantIc Web      173  10237.indb   173  9 25 15   10:41 AM      The more records   about more entities that  can be connected to- gether, the richer the  knowledge represented  online can be.  174     chaPter 7  10237.indb   174  9 25 15   10:41 AM   As  of  this  writing,  the  J.  Paul  Getty  Research  Insti- tute  is  currently  working  on  publishing  all  four  of  their  vocabularies,  discussed  above,  as  linked  open  data:  the  Art & Architecture Thesaurus and the Thesaurus of Geo- graphic Names were published in 2014, and the other two  vocabularies will follow in 2015. Every record in the AAT  and  the  TGN   for  example,  “sofas”   currently  includes  a  “Semantic View,” which is a set of statements in which the  resource exists as the subject, predicate, and or object: in  other words, all of the parent terms  furniture, multiple- seating furniture, etc.  and child terms  canapés, chester- fields, etc.  in the hierarchy, as well as the dates of creation  and modification of the term, the unique ID for the term  in English and other languages, etc. Some URIs from the  Getty  vocabularies  have  been  included  in  DBpedia,  thus  linking this very rich network to others.  The New York Times’ linked open data vocabulary was  mentioned in passing, above. In 2010, The New York Times  began  publishing  their  “Times  Topics”  subject  headings,  a  list  of  approximately  30,000  terms  covering  topics  re- ported on in the newspaper. As of this writing, the Times  has published approximately 10,000 of these. The URIs for  at least some of these have been included in DBpedia, thus  linking the very rich data provided by the New York Times  to that extracted from Wikipedia.  The  Library  of  Congress  Subject  Headings,  Name  Authority  File,  and  other  vocabularies  have  been  made      the seMantIc Web      175  10237.indb   175  9 25 15   10:41 AM   available as the Library of Congress Linked Data Service.  Some unique identifiers from the Library of Congress have  been included in DBpedia.  As discussed above, the Library of Congress has joined  with  several  other  nations’  national  libraries,  the  Getty  Research Institute, and OCLC, to develop VIAF™, the Vir- tual International Authority File. Many unique identifiers  from VIAF have been included in DBpedia.  Even Facebook, a company that has a reputation for  being fairly restrictive about providing access to their data,  has published a schema: the Open Graph protocol is a set  of  elements   called  “properties”:  title,  type,  image,  url,  etc.   and  recommended  values   article,  music.song,  mu- sic.album, video.movie, etc. , that allows any resource on  the web to “become a rich object in a social graph.” When  a video or a news article, for example, is embedded in a  status update on Facebook, the title and description are  imported via OGP.  There are in fact dozens or hundreds of organizations  and services that make their data available as linked open  data: the Linking Open Data cloud diagram shows many   though  probably  not  all   of  these,  and  connections  be- tween them. In total, the datasets in the current version of  this diagram contain over 20 billion subject-predicate-ob- ject triples. Over time, more and more datasets have been  made available as linked data, and more will no doubt be  made available in the future.  176     chaPter 7  10237.indb   176  9 25 15   10:41 AM   More Is More  Enriching  knowledge  by  connecting  networks  together  sounds like a good idea. After all, described that way, we  could be talking about the Internet itself, and it would be  difficult to argue that the Internet wasn’t a good idea. The  technologies that have arisen from the Internet are famil- iar, however, and their use in daily life are reasonably well  understood. It’s less clear how linked data might be used. Shortly  after  Tim  Berners-Lee  and  colleagues  first  articulated their vision of the semantic web, Bijan Parsia  wrote an excellent brief article titled “A simple, prima facie  argument in favor of the Semantic Web.”  Sadly, and some- what  ironically,  this  article  has  vanished  from  the  web,  along with the site that published it, and is now only avail- able through the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.  To  paraphrase, Parsia’s simple, prima facie argument goes like  this:  web  links,  as  they  currently  exist,  are  “untyped”— that is, a link is simply a pointer from webpage A to web- page B; a link contains no data to provide context for why  it exists between those two pages. Nevertheless, network  analysis is a powerful tool, even when the network con- tains only untyped links… and by making use of network  analysis, Google has created remarkable tools and services.  Therefore, Parsia argues, if web links were typed, Google   and other tools that rely on network analysis  could create  even more remarkable tools and services. To make Parsia’s  simple argument even simpler: more data is better.     the seMantIc Web      177  10237.indb   177  9 25 15   10:41 AM   It’s certainly possible to argue with a “more is more”  argument:  the  availability  of  increasingly  more  data  has  led to discussions of a “data deluge”  among other terms  that  get  used  for  this  phenomenon   for  over  a  hundred  years. But the availability of increasingly more data makes  it possible for tools and services to be built that make use  of that data. Search engines like AltaVista and Excite were  ticking along happily in the mid-1990s, relying on full-text  indexing, when suddenly Google came along with an al- gorithm that made use of more data: by layering network  analysis  on  top  of  full-text  indexing,  Google  shifted  the  entire search engine marketplace. Innovations that lever- age data that exists online, but that no one had previously  thought to use in quite that way, seem to be the bread and  butter of the Internet. When data is available, someone  somewhere will figure out how to use it. It may not be in  a way that you are happy with  few people outside of the  intelligence community are probably happy with the NSA’s  use of cell phone metadata , and it may even destroy your  business model  as Google did to AltaVista . But more is  indeed more, on the larger scale of creating an environ- ment that encourages innovation.  Schema.org  178     chaPter 7  One particularly important project to simplify the task of  putting structured data on the web is schema.org. Schema.  10237.indb   178  9 25 15   10:41 AM   org is something of a rare beast: a collaboration between  Google,  Microsoft,  and  Yahoo,  companies  that  probably  rarely collaborate on anything. But as companies with sig- nificant business interests in search technology, schema. org serves all of their interests very directly.  Schema.org is based on microdata, which is a speci- fication  for  embedding  metadata  inside  a  webpage.  The    tag, discussed in chapter 3, allows metadata to be  included in the   section of a webpage. Microdata— and  schema.org—go  further  than  that,  and  allow  meta- data to be included anywhere in a webpage.  An entire book longer than this one could be dedicated  to a How To for schema.org.  The same could be said of all  of the schemas and vocabularies that are brushed over so  quickly in this book.  That said, here is a very brief over- view of the mechanics of schema.org, using this book as  an example.  Schema.org  relies  heavily  on  the  HTML     tag,  which specifies a section or division of a webpage. For the  sake of this example, assume that the webpage on the MIT  Press site for the Essential Knowledge series, of which this  book is a part, contains a section for this book. That sec- tion might look like this:           the seMantIc Web      179  10237.indb   179  9 25 15   10:41 AM    <a href=“http:  mitpress.mit.edu books  metadata”>Metadata     by <a href=“http:  mitpress.mit.edu authors  jeffrey-pomerantz”> Jeffrey Pomerantz     Everything we need to know about metadata,  the usually invisible infrastructure for information  with which we interact every day.      To parse this markup, this section contains an image of the  book cover, a title that is also a link to a webpage about the  book, the author’s name that is a link to a webpage about  the author, and a brief blurb about the book. Here is that  same section, marked up with schema.org metadata:     <img itemprop=“image” src=“metadata-bookcover. jpg”>   <a href=“http:  mitpress.mit  .edu books metadata”>Metadata    180     chaPter 7  10237.indb   180  9 25 15   10:41 AM    by <a href=“http:   mitpress.mit.edu authors jeffrey-pomerantz”>  Jeffrey Pomerantz     Everything we  need to know about metadata, the usually invisible  infrastructure for information with which we interact  every day.      The itemscope element in the opening div tag declares  that  the  section  is  about  an  item.  The  itemtype  element  declares the type of item that the section is about  in this  case,  a  book ,  and  indicates  that  the  declaration  of  that  type in schema.org is at the URL provided. Now any ap- plication that parses this webpage—that can also interpret  schema.org metadata—will be able to interpret the prop- erties of the item type Book, because those are enumer- ated at that URL.  Schema.org declares many properties for the item type  Book. Some of these are image, name, author, and descrip- tion, which are used above. Every property expects data  of a specific type: name and description expect a string of  text, author expects a person or an organization, image ex- pects a URL. Each data type also has properties: a person,  for example, may have dates of birth and death  of data      the seMantIc Web      181  10237.indb   181  9 25 15   10:41 AM   type date , an affiliation  data type organization , and an  address  data type postal address .  Types in schema.org form a hierarchy: a person, for  example, is a type of Thing, which is the highest level entity  in schema.org. A PostalAddress is a child entity of Contact- Point, which is a child of StructuredValue, which is a child of  Intangible, which is a child of Thing. Child entities inherit  properties from their parents, so a postal address, for ex- ample, must have a description, because that is a property  of Thing. This is the same kind of hierarchical structure as  was illustrated in the Seattle example in chapter 2.  This is all well and good. But again, how would schema. org actually be used in practice? Fortunately, it is simpler  to answer this question about schema.org, than it is to an- swer this question about linked open data generally.  And  the  answer  is:  Search  in  Google  for  “MIT  press  metadata.” Chances are, you will get a link to this book on  MIT Press’ website as your first result. Do not click through  to that page: instead, look at the 2-line snippet of text below  the link. Note that that snippet is similar to the description  above from the example of schema.org markup. Why is that  text showing up in Google search results? It is because the  HTML markup for the webpage for this book on the MIT  Press website indicates the section where the description is  located. Google’s web crawler then simply grabs that text,  assuming that the markup is telling the truth.  This  is  a  trivial  example,  as  only  the  content  of  the  description  appears  in  these  search  results.  Many   182     chaPter 7  10237.indb   182  9 25 15   10:41 AM   organizations  make  use  schema.org  markup  much  more  extensively,  however,  which  enables  Google   and  other  search tools  to provide much more refined search results.  A particularly rich example of this is to search for recipes.  Search in Google for “chocolate chip cookie recipe,” or for  a recipe of your choosing. Below the search box, you will  see a Search tools button: click it, and several menus drop  down,  including  Ingredients,  Cook time,  and  Calories.  Say  you have a nut allergy: you can restrict the list of ingredi- ents in the recipes retrieved for your search so that recipes  with nuts are not included. Say you’re on a diet: you can  restrict the list of retrieved recipes to include only those  that produce cookies of less than 100 calories.  How  does  Google  do  this?  The  short  answer  is:  schema.org.  Probably  every  one  of  the  recipes  retrieved  for  this  chocolate  chip  cookie  search  is  marked  up  with  schema.org  metadata.  Every  element  of  a  recipe  can  be  specified  using  schema.org,  including  ingredi- ents   itemprop=”ingredient” ,  preparation  instructions   itemprop=“instructions” , yield  itemprop=“yield” , num- ber of calories  itemprop=“calories” , etc.  There are two pieces to schema.org: a set of entities  and  their  properties,  and  a  syntax  for  embedding  data  about these entities into webpages. When this structured  data is embedded in a webpage, Google, Bing, Yahoo, and  any other search tool that can parse schema.org, can make  use of it to enable the user to create highly customized and  filtered searches. Searching in Google for “chocolate chip      the seMantIc Web      183  10237.indb   183  9 25 15   10:41 AM   cookie recipe no nuts less than 100 calories” might retrieve  some  useful  results,  but  using  the  Search tools  menus  is  likely to be more accurate.  Ultimately, this is the promise of the semantic web,  and  the  validation  of  Parsia’s  “more  is  more”  argument.  The more data that exists on the web, and specifically the  more data that’s embedded in webpages, the more web ser- vices can do with that data to help the user navigate the  very large information space that is the web. And when  that data is openly available, in open formats, it’s possible  for new applications to be built to provide new services.  Often it is the big players on the web—Google, Microsoft,  and Yahoo, for example—that develop these new services,  but this is not always the case. Open data creates an en- vironment that encourages innovation, in which anyone,  anywhere, can potentially build useful tools and services.  Conclusion  The vision of the semantic web is of a “web of data” that  can  be  used  by  algorithms  and  other  forms  of  software  agents to perform tasks automatically, on behalf of human  users. To achieve this vision, the semantic web relies on  structured data and metadata about resources that can be  passed between services.  Structured data is necessary to achieve the vision of  the semantic web, but not sufficient. Not only must data   184     chaPter 7  10237.indb   184  9 25 15   10:41 AM      The vision of the   semantic web is of a  “web of data” that can  be used by algorithms  and other forms of soft- ware agents to perform  tasks automatically, on  behalf of human users.     the seMantIc Web      185  10237.indb   185  9 25 15   10:41 AM   be  structured,  but  that  structure  must  adhere  to  widely  shared standards. If every web service developed its own  schema for structuring its data, that would be the equiva- lent of every town and city developing its own type of fire  hydrants: there could be no collaboration between fire de- partments because no department’s hoses would fit any  other department’s hydrants. Only when everyone—or at  least a significant portion of everyone—is using the same  standards, is widespread collaboration possible.  The quote at the start of this chapter makes this point  explicitly for linked data. Almost no matter what kind of  resources  need  describing,  a  schema  or  a  controlled  vo- cabulary or a thesaurus has already been developed to de- scribe it. Do you need to describe fire ecology? Railways?  Offshore  drilling?  Astronomical  objects?  Web  services?  Someone out there has created a thesaurus for you. To be  sure, many of these will not be free to use: a niche mar- ket exists for businesses developing taxonomies for niche  markets. But even if you’re using a proprietary standard,  you can still share data with others who are using that pro- prietary standard, even if not with the rest of the world.  And, of course, it’s linked open data only if the standard  being used is open—that is, free to implement. The quote  at the start of this chapter is an argument for using shared  standards,  whether  open  or  closed.  Do  not  reinvent  the  wheel: almost guaranteed, a wheel has already been devel- oped that will suit your needs.  186     chaPter 7  10237.indb   186  9 25 15   10:41 AM   8  the future of Metadata  chaPter 8  Metadata, as we saw in chapter 1, is fundamental to the  operation of libraries. This was true in the time of Callima- chus, and it is no less true today. Many types of collections  of resources exist, however, maintained by libraries as well  as by organizations of all types. Metadata is fundamental  to the operation of all of these types of collections. In the  modern era of ubiquitous computing and structured data,  metadata  is  perhaps  more  important  than  ever  before.  As the volume and variety of resources online increases,  metadata will continue to be fundamental to the future.  Among  the  most  interesting  projects  currently  on- going in the library world are Europeana and the Digital  Public  Library  of  America   DPLA .  Both  are  collections  of  materials  from  cultural  heritage  institutions   librar- ies, archives, and museums , digitized and made available  online. Neither host these digitized materials; all digital  objects  are  hosted  by  the  cultural  heritage  institutions   10237.indb   187  9 25 15   10:41 AM   themselves  what Europeana calls Partners, and the DPLA  calls Hubs . The role of Europeana and the DPLA is that of  a portal: to provide functionality to enable users to access  these materials via searching, browsing, and application  program interfaces  APIs .  Metadata  is  central  to  providing  this  functionality.  Both  Europeana  and  the  DPLA  have  developed  custom  metadata schemas: the Europeana Data Model  EDM  and  the  DPLA  Metadata  Application  Profile   MAP .  Both  of  these articulate an abstract model as well as a set of prop- erties specific to each entity  called a class  in the abstract  model. For example, both metadata schemas differentiate  between the cultural heritage object itself  what the DPLA  refers to as the SourceResource class  and the web resource  that is the digital representation of the source resource.  Both further articulate other types of entities: aggregations  or collections of the source or digital resources, places, and  time spans. Both the EDM and the MAP then articulate a  set of properties of these entities. For example, the prop- erties  of  the  SourceResource,  in  both  the  EDM  and  the  MAP, include creator, description, subject, title, isPartOf,  references, and replaces, and many of the other 15 Dublin  Core elements and larger set of Dublin Core Terms. Several  unique properties have also been developed for the EDM,  and subsequently adopted by the MAP: for example, incor- porates, isDerivativeOf, and isSimilarTo. The EDM  and by  extension the MAP  also incorporates elements from other   188     chaPter 8  10237.indb   188  9 25 15   10:41 AM   metadata schemas, including the Open Archives Initiative  Object Reuse and Exchange  OAI-ORE , and the Creative  Commons Rights Expression Language.  In short, Europeana and the DPLA have taken meta- data  schemas  created  for  several  different  use  cases,  se- lected those elements that are relevant for describing the  universe of cultural heritage, and built a custom data model  and element set for that purpose. In doing this, Europeana  and the DPLA are at the forefront of a growing movement  to develop domain-specific metadata.  Domain-Specific Metadata  Pandora is a popular online music service that makes ex- tensive use of metadata. The heart of Pandora is the Mu- sic Genome Project®, which consists of approximately 450  characteristics that may be used to describe a piece of mu- sic. These characteristics are the equivalent of elements in  a metadata schema, and run the gamut from the relatively  simple  for example, key, tempo, beats per minute, gender  of the vocalist  to the highly subjective  for example, vocal  characteristics, degree of distortion of instruments . Pan- dora employs a team of musicians whose job it is to listen  to every song that Pandora licenses, and to describe each  song according to as many of these hundreds of character- istics as are relevant. Characteristics are the equivalent of      the future of Metadata      189  10237.indb   189  9 25 15   10:41 AM   elements, to which the Pandora team assigns values. Some  of the controlled vocabularies from which values may be  selected are probably straightforward, like the set of values  for key  A, B, C, etc., and major or minor , beats per min- ute  an integer , tempo  adagio, andante, allegro, etc. , and  gender of the vocalist. Some values are probably unique to  Pandora, are Pandora’s value-add in the highly competitive  music marketplace.  It is easy to apply descriptive metadata to digitized mu- sic files, but it is difficult to do it well. In part this is be- cause music both evolves rapidly and is a highly subjective  experience. On the one hand, some characteristics defined  in the Music Genome Project are quite stable: for example,  the set of values for key, tempo, and beats per minute. On  the other hand, some vocabularies that provide values for  certain characteristics change over time, as genres of music  evolve, and the technology used to record and process music  evolves. For example, the genre “house music” not only has  a large number of subgenres; it is an active area of musical  innovation, so new subgenres emerge frequently. As Pan- dora adds songs in the genres “Complextro,” “Dutch house,”  “Moombahton,”  “Nu-disco,”  and  whatever  subgenre  of  house music will emerge next, those values are presumably  added to the controlled vocabulary used for the characteris- tic “genre.” Thus Pandora—and presumably all other music  services—face the challenge of constantly having to update  their  metadata,  both  characteristics  and  the  controlled   190     chaPter 8  10237.indb   190  9 25 15   10:41 AM   vocabularies  that  provide  values  to  them.  Even  classical  music—a genre in which one might expect description to  be well established—faces this challenge. Many performers  record versions of the same pieces of music, for example,  and the metadata for online music services does not always  capture the distinction between the composer and the per- former. For this and other reasons, descriptive metadata for  classical music is an area of active development.  Music is, of course, not the only domain in which cus- tom metadata exists. The field of education, for example,  has a fairly long history with metadata. The Institute of  Electrical and Electronics Engineers  IEEE  Standard for  Learning Object Metadata was first developed in 2002 to  describe “learning objects”: usually  though not necessar- ily  digital resources that may be used to support teaching  and learning around a single learning objective. The LOM  consists of a set of categories, each of which contains a set  of elements that describe it. For example, the Educational  category contains elements such as TypicalAgeRange and  TypicalLearningTime,  while  the  Rights  category  contains  the  Copyright  element.  Many  learning  management  sys- tems   LMS   used  in  K–12  and  higher  education  contain  functionality to support LOM, so that a learning object,  or collection of learning objects, can be imported into the  LMS if associated LOM metadata is present.  Moreover  the  field  of  education  is  an  area  of  active  metadata  development.  One  area  that  has  traditionally      the future of Metadata      191  10237.indb   191  9 25 15   10:41 AM   resisted standardization in higher education is transcripts:  while many institutions of higher education use the same  enterprise systems, student transcripts are still most often  printed  and  sent  by  mail.  Recently,  however,  companies  such as Parchment are developing schemas that represent  entities  such  as  students,  courses,  and  programs,  which  enable  institutions  to  export  and  import  student  tran- scripts and other credentials.  Publishing is another field that both has long history  with metadata and is a current area of active development.  Publishing metadata has traditionally consisted of simple  descriptive metadata: publisher, date of publication, ISBN,  etc. With the advent of ebooks, as well as the rise of self- publishing platforms such as Amazon’s Kindle Direct Pub- lishing, Lulu, and others, publishers  and self-publishers   are discovering that the richness and quality of one’s meta- data is critical to whether or not a title is discovered by  readers.  APIs  Application programming interfaces  API  are one of the  most interesting uses of metadata on the web, yet APIs are  often not even recognized as an application of metadata.  An API is a set of functions that may be used to interact  with a piece of software, often a web service. Most web   192     chaPter 8  10237.indb   192  9 25 15   10:41 AM   services   Twitter,  YouTube,  Flickr,  Goodreads,  Evernote,  Dropbox, etc.  have APIs. Some web services have multiple  APIs. Amazon, for example, has APIs for their products,  payments,  web  services,  Kindle,  and  several  other  parts  of their business. Google has APIs for most of their prod- ucts. APIs are often bidirectional: different functions let  the user export data from or import data to a web service. Web services such as Flickr, YouTube, and Amazon, of  course, have well-developed user interfaces. These “front  end” interfaces are generally rich with features that enable  a user to interact with the resources hosted by the service   photos,  videos,  products,  etc. .  APIs,  however,  provide  something of an end-run around this front end, enabling  interaction both with the resources and metadata about  the resources. APIs are not secret backdoors; they’re delib- erately created to provide an alternative method of inter- acting with the web service, often for algorithms such as  software agents.  APIs are an area where what is data and what is meta- data is largely in the eye of the beholder. From the point of  view of the web service, everything provided via the API  is data, since there may not be any distinction in how dif- ferent pieces of data are stored, and the API may provide  access to both resources and metadata. An entity-relation- ship model for a database may not differentiate between  data  that’s  a  resource  and  data  that’s  metadata:  it’s  all  just data. From another point of view, however, only the      the future of Metadata      193  10237.indb   193  9 25 15   10:41 AM   resource itself is data  the tweet, the video on YouTube,  the digital object hosted on a museum website, etc. ; ev- erything else is metadata about it.  As web services have proliferated, APIs have prolifer- ated right alongside them. Some APIs in fact get as much  or even more traffic than the associated front end website  for the service. This is why they are worth discussing in  this chapter on the future of metadata: APIs are becoming  an increasingly popular mechanism by which the metadata  about resources  and yes, the resources themselves  may  be accessed.  APIs, of course, allow individuals to create applications  in the “ecosystem” of a web service: applications that cre- ate custom YouTube playlists, for example, or that “mash  up” data from two or more services. The DPLA in particu- lar encourages the development of apps that make use of  data from the API, highlighting these in an App Library.  Some of the more interesting of these apps include DPLA  Map, an app that identifies resources in the DPLA near the  user’s current location, and WikipeDPLA, a browser plugin  that inserts links into Wikipedia articles to relevant items  in the DPLA’s collections.  The service IFTTT  If This Then That  exists entirely  thanks to the APIs provided by other services. IFTTT en- ables  users  to  create  “recipes”  that  export  data  from  one  service’s API and import it into another service’s API, con- ditional  on  some  event:  for  example,  one’s  Fitbit  activity   194     chaPter 8  10237.indb   194  9 25 15   10:41 AM   summaries can be added to a Google spreadsheet once per  day, or one can receive a text message every time the Inter- national Space Station is overhead at one’s location, or one’s  Nest Thermostat can be set to a specific temperature when  one enters a particular geographic area. In this way IFTTT  provides a mechanism for connecting the structured data  from  as of this writing  well over 150 services together.  APIs allow algorithms access to the metadata stored by  services. Recall from the example in chapter 7 of schedul- ing a medical appointment, that this is exactly Berners- Lee and colleagues’ vision of the semantic web. As services  make more data available via APIs, other services can be  built that make use of that data. IFTTT is not currently  sophisticated enough to schedule one’s medical appoint- ments, but it is certainly a step in that direction.  David  Weinberger,  in  his  excellent  book  Small  Pieces  Loosely Joined, articulates “a unified theory of the web”: spe- cifically, that it is composed of small pieces, loosely joined.  Less tautologically, Weinberger’s thesis is that the web has  exploded large entities. He uses the example of documents:  large texts no longer need to be bound together as a unitary  entity called a book, instead a text can be composed of small  entities loosely joined by links. What makes Weinberger’s  book prescient is that this also holds true for other sorts of  entities: in particular, datasets and services.  What makes it possible for the web to be composed of  small pieces loosely joined? Metadata. Passing structured      the future of Metadata      195  10237.indb   195  9 25 15   10:41 AM   data back and forth enables online services to be small and  focused, yet rely on other services to provide needed data.  Recall Bijan Parsia’s “more is more” argument for the se- mantic web: when more data is freely available, more tools  and services can be built that make use of that data. Tim  Berners-Lee’s vision of the semantic web is premised on  the Web of Data being composed of small pieces that pass  metadata back and forth. The Web of Data might in fact  equally well be called the Web of Metadata.  eScience  One domain in which an increasing amount of data is be- coming available, and in which there is a significant benefit  to enabling small pieces to be loosely joined is in eScience.  eScience is computation-intensive and data-intensive re- search methods and analysis, and includes, though is not  limited  to,  what  is  commonly  referred  to  as  “big  data”  science.  There is, of course, much debate around what exactly  constitutes “big data”: the Human Genome Project, for ex- ample, may be considered to be big data science, though  an entire human genome is only about 200 GB, while the  Large  Hadron  Collider  produces  an  equivalent  amount  of data in under 5 minutes. Regardless of the volume of  data, most eScience projects also involve intensive use of   196     chaPter 8  10237.indb   196  9 25 15   10:41 AM      What makes it   possible for the web to  be composed of small  pieces loosely joined?  Metadata.     the future of Metadata      197  10237.indb   197  9 25 15   10:41 AM   computation to conduct analysis—for example, in weather  modeling,  where  increasingly  powerful  supercomputers  have been employed to develop increasingly detailed and  accurate forecasts.  The fact also remains that even a “mere” 200 GB is too  large a dataset for any single person, or even team of peo- ple, to grasp in its entirety. This is where metadata comes  in. A metadata record, as a surrogate for a dataset, is often  more useful than the dataset itself as an access point for  interested researchers—just as a library catalog card or an  entry on Amazon may be more useful than a whole book  as an access point for interested readers. First one has to  identify a useful dataset  or book , and only after that does  one actually make use of it.  Descriptive  metadata  for  resource  discovery  enables  eScience,  but  provenance  metadata  enables  trust  in  the  products  of  eScience.  A  dataset  associated  with  a  pub- lished journal article, and hosted by the journal publisher,  inherits, so to speak, the imprimatur associated with peer  reviewed scholarly literature. For a dataset self-hosted by  a researcher, the authority behind that dataset may be less  clear. Thus metadata about the provenance of datasets be- comes critical, for any future reuse of that data.  The provenance of a dataset may be addressed at two  levels: the dataset as a whole, and the individual values in  it. Provenance metadata for a dataset might include state- ments such as the funding agency, names of researchers   198     chaPter 8  10237.indb   198  9 25 15   10:41 AM   involved  in  the  data  collection,  and  methodologies  em- ployed in the research. Provenance metadata for the indi- vidual values in a dataset might include statements such as  the methodology employed to collect a specific data point,  and any analyses or transformations that produced a par- ticular data point.  Some of the provenance metadata for individual values  in a dataset is referred to as “paradata”—somewhat con- fusingly, as the term “paradata”  recall from chapter 5  also  refers to use metadata about learning objects. In the con- text of provenance metadata, however, paradata is a term  for data that’s automatically captured about the process by  which data is collected. For example, paradata about a da- taset from a telephone survey might include the date and  time of each call, which calls were to phone numbers where  no one answered, and every keystroke and mouse move- ment made by the interviewer: in other words, data that  can be automatically collected by the systems used by the  telephone survey interviewers. Paradata is created at the  time of data collection, and it provides data about the cre- ation of a dataset. Another type of provenance metadata is  “auxiliary data,” an even less well-defined term. Auxiliary  data is often considered to be any data beyond a dataset it- self—in other words, any metadata about a dataset. More  specifically, auxiliary data may include both paradata and  variables  imported  from  other  datasets,  such  as  Census  or other demographic data from sources external to the      the future of Metadata      199  10237.indb   199  9 25 15   10:41 AM   organization that created a dataset. The proliferation of  terms to describe different categories of provenance meta- data  is  an  indication  of  just  how  important  provenance  metadata is for eScience.  Increasingly, it is the default for applications to store  the history of files, as a wiki stores every edit made to ev- ery page. This functionality of a wiki enables a user to view  the history of a page, to identify the other users  or at least  their IP addresses  who made each edit, and sometimes a  user’s comments concerning why they made an edit. Even  more robust history-tracking functionality will be critical  for eScience, since trust is even more important for a scien- tific dataset than it is for a Wikipedia entry. eScience may  rise or fall with the availability of provenance metadata,  to enable the identification of the relationships between a  resource and entities that have influenced its history.  Politics of Metadata  While the data collected by scientific instrumentation and  empirical research is critical to the progress of science, the  data that more people are likely to be concerned with are  data about themselves. Consumer products and services  generate vast quantities of data about ourselves and our  behaviors.  We  knowingly  trade  our  personal  privacy  for   200     chaPter 8  10237.indb   200  9 25 15   10:41 AM   the convenience of using such products and services: while  hardly  anyone  ever  reads  Terms  of  Service  agreements,  these  documents  do  specify  that  information  about  the  user is collected and analyzed.  Many web services collect and analyze data about their  users in order to provide a greater degree of customization  and personalization in the user experience. Google Now,  for example, is a service that proactively provides informa- tion to the user—such as notifications that based on cur- rent traffic one should leave for the airport now, and what  the best route is to take. Microsoft’s Cortana and Apple’s  Siri possess similar functionality. In order for these ser- vices to work, however, it is necessary for them to have ac- cess to a great deal of personal data: it is possible to provide  a notification that one should leave for the airport now,  only if the service has access to the user’s calendar and cur- rent physical location.  Computing  power  is  increasingly  embedded  in  com- mon  everyday  objects:  not  just  smartphones  and  home  electronics  but  vehicles,  roads  and  bridges,  medical  de- vices, even the monitoring and control systems in build- ings. This emerging “Internet of Things”—the expansion  of the Internet to computing devices embedded in a wide  range  of  physical  objects—is  entirely  dependent  on  the  collection  and  analysis  of  structured  data.  Some  of  this  data is environmental and not associated with individuals,  but much of it is individual and even quite personal. And,      the future of Metadata      201  10237.indb   201  9 25 15   10:41 AM   as in the example of scheduling a medical appointment, for  the Internet of Things to work and to fulfill its potential,  much of this data must be shared across services.  By and large, we trust that the services we use and sub- scribe to keep our personal data to themselves and their  partners: the data that Amazon, for example, has collected  about my purchasing habits gives Amazon a competitive  edge in keeping my business. Of course, we know that com- panies share our data with their partners, though generally  we have the option to opt in or out of such sharing. Perhaps  we’re fooling ourselves, but by and large we imagine that  our data, while not private, is at least restricted.  So  why  did  the  news  about  the  NSA’s  collection  of  phone  metadata  feel  like  such  a  violation  of  privacy?  It  wasn’t that the phone company collected data about our  phone calls. It was the revelation that this data was being  handed  over  to  another  organization,  without  our  con- sent, that violated this imagined trust.  Telephone companies and governments have collected  metadata  about  phone  calls  since  long  before  the  term  “metadata” was even invented. Perhaps one of the earli- est technologies for systematically collecting this type of  data exhaust is the pen register, a term that dates to the era  of the telegraph. A pen register is defined in the US Code   Title 18, Part II, Chapter 206, §3127  as “a device or pro- cess which records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing,  or  signaling  information  transmitted  by  an  instrument   202     chaPter 8  10237.indb   202  9 25 15   10:41 AM   or facility from which a wire or electronic communication  is transmitted.” More narrowly focused data collection is  performed by the trap and trace device, which collects only  data to “identify the originating number” or other origi- nating address of an electronic communication. In other  words,  pen  registers,  and  trap  and  trace  devices  collect  metadata about electronic communication, be it telegraph  messages, phone calls, emails, text messages, or any other  medium.  Importantly,  under  the  US  Code,  pen  registers  and trap and trace devices cannot collect “the contents of  any  communication”:  recording  the  contents  of  a  phone  call, for example, is considered wiretapping under the US  Code. The contents of a text message or a tweet, however,  are merely the value for one field in a very large record.  One of the early reactions to the Snowden revelations  in 2013 was the position that since the NSA was not en- gaging  in  wiretapping,  there  was  no  cause  for  concern.  This “it’s only metadata” argument is a valid legal position,  given that under US Code Title 18, a pen register or a trap  and trace device may collect the metadata about electronic  communications,  while  wiretapping  has  required  a  war- rant since the 1967 US Supreme Court case Katz v. United  States.  However,  recall  the  MetaPhone  study,  discussed  briefly  in  chapter  1.  Researchers  at  the  Stanford  Law  School Center for Internet and Society attempted to rep- licate the NSA’s data collection of phone metadata: study      the future of Metadata      203  10237.indb   203  9 25 15   10:41 AM   participants installed the MetaPhone app on their smart- phone, and this app collected data about the device. This  data  included,  among  other  things,  the  phone  numbers  called  by  study  participants’  phones,  and  the  time  and  duration of these calls. By querying public directories, the  researchers could identify the owners of these called phone  numbers, businesses and individuals.  The  MetaPhone  researchers  write:  “We  found  that  phone metadata is unambiguously sensitive.” The meta- data  is  not  the  problem,  however,  where  privacy  is  con- cerned, but the inferences that can be made from it. For  example, recall the study participant who called “a home  improvement store, locksmiths, a hydroponics dealer, and  a head shop.” Individually, each of these calls is relatively  innocuous: if each of these calls had been made by differ- ent study participants, it would raise no eyebrows. It is the  fact that these calls were all made by the same study partic- ipant that prompts us to make an inference about this indi- vidual’s activities. Of course, an inference is circumstantial  evidence, at best, and without more information, there is  no way for us to know whether or not our inference is cor- rect. But what makes phone metadata unambiguously sen- sitive is that it enables these kind of prejudicial inferences  to be made.  The Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution states   that:  204     chaPter 8  10237.indb   204  9 25 15   10:41 AM   The right of the people to be secure in their persons,  houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable  searches and seizures, shall not be violated …  An exception to this, however, is what is known as the  third-party doctrine. This was summed up in the 1979 US  Supreme Court case Smith v. Maryland as follows: one has  “no legitimate expectation of privacy” for data voluntarily  provided to a third party, such as a telephone company.  This voluntarily provided data includes the sort of personal  metadata that one must provide to the telephone company  in order to set up an account. Of course, the “third party”  here is not limited to a phone company; it may include In- ternet service providers, or indeed any commercial entity  to whom one provides information. All this data can be  collected by law enforcement without a warrant, with no  violation of the Fourth Amendment.  In the current era of ubiquitous metadata, there has  naturally been a great deal of discussion in the legal com- munity about the third-party doctrine, whether or not it  continues to be appropriate, and whether it needs to be  changed.  In  particular,  US  Supreme  Court  Justice  Sonia  Sotomayor has stated that the third-party doctrine is “ill- suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal  of  information  about  themselves  to  third  parties  in  the  course of carrying out mundane tasks.” Justice Sotomayor  was referring, at least in part, to data exhaust, and it is not      the future of Metadata      205  10237.indb   205  9 25 15   10:41 AM      Metadata—voluntarily  provided and data ex- haust alike — will be a   significant legal and   political issue in coming  years.  206     chaPter 8  10237.indb   206  9 25 15   10:41 AM   clear just how voluntary the revealing of such data can be  said to be.  Metadata—voluntarily  provided  and  data  exhaust  alike—will be a significant legal and political issue in com- ing years. Metadata for describing and administering web  resources, metadata for APIs, metadata describing music,  metadata about the provenance of art objects and scien- tific datasets: all of these and more will continue to evolve,  and tools will be developed to manage this metadata. This  metadata and tool development will give rise—is already  giving rise—to an entire subsector of the technology in- dustry. Still, the metadata that most people are likely to  care more about is metadata about themselves, and who  has  access  to  it.  This  personal  connection  to  metadata  is  likely  to  drive  legal  and  political  debates.  Just  as  the  Snowden  revelations  brought  the  word  “metadata”  into  the public eye, so will metadata continue to be front and  center in ongoing discussions around personal privacy.     the future of Metadata      207  10237.indb   207  9 25 15   10:41 AM   10237.indb   208  9 25 15   10:41 AM   glossary  Administrative metadata Information to inform the management of an object.

When «metadata» became breaking news, appearing in stories about surveillance by the National Security Agency, many members of the public encountered this once-obscure term from information science for the first time. Should people be reassured that the NSA was «only» collecting metadata about phone calls -- information about the caller, the recipient, the time, the duration, the location -- and not recordings of the conversations themselves? Or does phone call metadata reveal more than it seems? In this book, Jeffrey Pomerantz offers an accessible and concise introduction to metadata.
In the era of ubiquitous computing, metadata has become infrastructural, like the electrical grid or the highway system. We interact with it or generate it every day. It is not, Pomerantz tell us, just «data about data.» It is a means by which the complexity of an object is represented in a simpler form. For example, the title, the author, and the cover art are metadata about a book. When metadata does its job well, it fades into the background everyone (except perhaps the NSA) takes it for granted.
Pomerantz explains what metadata is, and why it exists. He distinguishes among different types of metadata -- descriptive, administrative, structural, preservation, and use -- and examines different users and uses of each type. He discusses the technologies that make modern metadata possible, and he speculates about metadatas future. By the end of the book, readers will see metadata everywhere. Because, Pomerantz warns us, its metadatas world, and we are just living in it.
