I’d also like to express my gratitude to the Italian Python community in particular,   one of the most welcoming out there!  xvii   Introduction  If you’re reading this, I’m glad! It means you are interested in Django, one of the most  powerful and flexible web frameworks out there.  When I discovered Django years ago, I realized I could make perfectly working  prototypes faster than with any other web framework; prototypes that later would  become robust, rock-solid web applications.  These days, with JavaScript all the rage, the temptation to jump on the JavaScript-  full- stack bandwagon is strong, and sometimes this tendency makes beginners think  that everything must be built with JavaScript. It shouldn’t. Even if I work primarily with  JavaScript, Django is still my safe harbor for building stuff quickly.  At the same time, used with cognition, modern frontend libraries like Vue.js and   React pair well with Django, which can work completely decoupled from the frontend.  This book is an attempt to cover a part of the vast spectrum of decoupled architectures  with Django and JavaScript, with an eye on the last developments in the asynchronous  Django land, and on the integration between Django and GraphQL. Here’s a breakdown  of what you can expect from each chapter.                  In Chapters 1, 2, and 3, we introduce the terminology, what makes a  decoupled architecture, how modern JavaScript is supposed to work  in Django, and how the Django REST framework can help you build  REST APIs.  In Chapter 4, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of a  decoupled architecture.  In Chapters 5 and 6, we begin to build a Django project with the  Django REST framework and Vue.js to show how Vue can work from  within Django templates.  In Chapter 7, we discuss security for REST APIs, and deployment of  our Django Vue.js project.  xix   InTroduCTIon      In Chapter 8, we move to React and Next.js to show how such a  framework can be paired with Django. We cover Next.js basics and  data fetching.     Chapter 9 covers testing, both for the REST API and for the JavaScript   frontend.     Chapter 10 covers authentication for decoupled setups and shows  you how to use session-based authentication for single-page apps  with the help of NGINX.     Finally, in Chapters 11 and 12, we cover GraphQL in Django, with a   look at running Django asynchronously.  All the system commands presented in this book assume that the reader is using a  Linux or MacOS system. As for the prerequisites, a basic knowledge of TypeScript and  modern frontend libraries is expected.  Have fun!  xx   CHAPTER 1  Introduction to the  Decoupled World  This chapter offers a brief introduction to:     Monoliths and decoupled architectures     REST architectures     The GraphQL query language  In this chapter, we review traditional web applications, the classic MVC pattern   based on views, models, and controllers.  We begin to outline use cases, benefits, and drawbacks of decoupled architectures.   We explore the foundations of REST, look at how it compares to GraphQL, and learn that  REST APIs are not only RESTful after all.   Monoliths and MVC For at least two decades, traditional websites and applications all shared a common  design based on the Model-View-Controller pattern, abbreviated MVC.  This pattern wasn’t built in a day. In the beginning, there was an intertwined mess   of business logic, HTML, and what once was a pale imitation of the JavaScript we  know today. In a typical MVC arrangement, when a user requests a path to a website,  the application responds with some HTML. Behind the scenes, a controller, usually a  function or a method, takes care to return the appropriate view to the user. This happens  after the controller populates the view with data coming from the database layer, most of  the time, through an ORM  object-relational mapping . Such a system, acting as a whole  to serve the user, with all its components living in a single place, is called monolith.      Valentino Gagliardi 2021  V.

Figure 1-1  shows a representation of MVC.  REQUEST  RESPONSE  VIEW  MODEL  CONTROLLER  Figure 1-1.  An MVC application responds to the user with a view, generated by a  controller. The model layer supplies the data from the database  MVC has variations, like the Model-View-Template pattern employed by Django. In  Django’s MVT, the data comes still from the database, but the view acts like a controller:  it gets data from the database through the ORM and injects the result in a template,  which is returned to the user. MVC and its variations are well and alive: all the most  popular web frameworks like .NET core, Rails, Laravel, and Django itself employ this  pattern with success. However, in recent times we are seeing the spread of decoupled  applications based on a service-oriented architecture.  In this design, a RESTful or a GraphQL API exposes data for one or more JavaScript   frontends, for a mobile application, or for another machine. Service-oriented and  decoupled architectures are a broader category that encompasses the galaxy of  microservices systems. Throughout the book, we refer to decoupled architectures in the  context of web applications, mainly as systems with a REST API, or GraphQL on the  backend, and a separated JavaScript HTML frontend. Before focusing on REST APIs, let’s  first unpack what’s behind a decoupled architecture.   What Makes a Decoupled Architecture? A decoupled architecture is a system that abides to one of the most important rules in  software engineering: separation of concerns.  2   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to the deCoupled World  In a decoupled architecture, there is a clear separation between the client and the  server. This is also one of the most important constraints required by REST. Figure 1-2  shows an overview of such a system, with a backend and a frontend.  REQUEST  REQUEST  MODEL  VIEW  RESPONSE  RESPONSE  CONTROLLER  SINGLE-PAGE APP  REST API  Figure 1-2.  A decoupled application with a REST API as a data source for a  JavaScript HTML frontend  As you will see later in the book, this separation between client and server, views and   controllers, is not always strict, and depending on the decoupling style, the distinction  becomes blurry. For example, we can have the REST API and the frontend living in two  completely different environments  separate domains or different origins . In this case,  the division is crystal clear. In some situations, when a full JavaScript frontend would not  make sense, Django can still expose a REST or GraphQL API, with JavaScript embedded  in a Django template talking to the endpoints.  To muddle things further, frameworks like Angular adopt the Model-View-Controller  pattern even for structuring frontend code. In a single-page application, we can find the  same MVC design, which replicates the backend structure. You can already guess that one  of the disadvantages of a purely decoupled architecture is, to some extent, code duplication.  Having defined what is a decoupled architecture, let’s now talk about its use cases.   Why and When to Decouple? This isn’t a book about the JavaScript gold rush. In fact, you should weigh your options  long before thinking about a full rewrite of your beloved Django monolith.  3   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to the deCoupled World  Not every project needs a single-page application. If instead your application falls   under one of the following categories, you can start evaluating the advantages of a  decoupled architecture. Here’s a list of the most common use cases:     Machine-to-machine communication      Interactive dashboards with heavy JS-driven interactions     Static site generation     Mobile applications  With Django, you can build all sorts of things involving machine-to-machine   communication. Think of an industrial application to collect data from sensors that  can be later aggregated in all sorts of data reporting. Such dashboards can have a lot of  JS-driven interactions. Another interesting application for decoupled architectures are  content repositories. Monoliths like Django, CMS like Drupal, or blogging platforms like  WordPress are good companions for static site generators. We explore this topic in detail  later.  Another benefit of a decoupled architecture is the ability to serve different types   of clients: mobile applications are one of the most compelling use cases. Now, if  decoupled architectures sound too appealing, I advise you to consider their drawbacks.  Decoupled architectures based exclusively on single-page applications are not always a  valid choice for:     Websites with little or no JS-driven interactions     Constrained teams     Constrained devices     Content-heavy websites with search engine optimization in mind  Note  as you will see in Chapter 7, frameworks like next.js can help with  search engine optimization for single-page apps by producing static htMl. other  examples of frameworks employing this technique are Gatsby and prerenderer.  It’s easy to get overwhelmed by modern frontend development, especially if the team   is small. One of the most serious hindrances when designing or building a decoupled  architecture from scratch is the sheer amount of complexity lurking behind the surface   4   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to the deCoupled World  of JavaScript tooling. In the next sections, we focus on REST and GraphQL, the two  pillars of a decoupled architecture.   Hypermedia All the Things The foundation for almost any decoupled frontend architecture is the REST   architectural style.  REST is hardly a novel concept these days. The theory is that through verbs or   commands, we create, retrieve, or modify resources on a system. For example, given a  User model on the backend, exposed by a REST API as a resource, we can get a collection  of all the instances present in the database with a GET HTTP request. The following  shows a typical GET request to retrieve a list of entities:  GET https:  api.example api users   As you can see, we say users, not user, when retrieving the resource. As a   convention, resources should always be plural. To retrieve a single resource from the  API, we pass instead the ID in the path, as a path parameter. The following shows a GET  request to a single resource:  GET https:  api.example api users 1  Table 1-1 shows a breakdown of all the verbs  HTTP methods  and their effect on the   resources.  Table 1-1.  HTTP Methods with the Corresponding  Effect on a Given Resource Present on the Backend  Method  Effect  Idempotent  POST  GET  PUT  DELETE  PATCH  Create resource  retrieve resource s   update resource  delete resource  partial update resource  no  Yes  Yes  Yes  no  5   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to the deCoupled World  To refer to this set of HTTP methods we also use the term CRUD, which stands for  Create, Read, Update, and Delete. As you can see from the table, some HTTP verbs are  idempotent, meaning that the result of the operation is always stable. A GET request  for example always returns the same data, no matter how many times we issue the  command after the first request. A POST request instead will always induce a side effect,  that is, create a new resource on the backend with different values for each call. When  retrieving a resource with GET, we can use search parameters in a query string to specify  search constraints, sorting, or to limit the number of results. The following shows a  request for a limited set of users:  GET https:  api.example api users?limit=20  When creating a new resource with POST instead, we can send a request body   alongside the request. Depending on the operation type, the API can respond with  an HTTP status code, and with the newly created object. Common examples of HTTP  response code are 200 OK and 201 Created, 202 Accepted. When things don’t go well,  the API might respond with an error code. Common examples of HTTP error codes are  500 Internal Server Error, 403 Forbidden, and 401 Unauthorized.  This back and forth communication between the client and the server carries JSON  objects over the HTTP protocol. Nowadays, JSON is the preferred format for exchanging  data, whereas in the past you could have seen XML over HTTP  SOAP architectures are  still alive these days . Why does REST follow these conventions, and why does it use  HTTP? When Roy Fielding wrote his dissertation entitled, “Architectural Styles and the  Design of Network-based Software Architectures” in 2000, he defined the following rules:     Hypermedia as the engine: When requesting a resource, the response   from the APIs must also include hyperlinks to related entities or to  other actions.     Client-server separation: The consumer  JavaScript, a machine, or a   generic client  and the Web API must be two separate entities.     Stateless: The communication between client and server should not   use any data stored on the server.     Cacheable: The API should leverage HTTP caching as much as   possible.  6   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to the deCoupled World     Uniform interface: The communication between client and server   should use a representation of the resources involved, and a standard  language for the communication.  It’s worth taking a quick detour to dive deeper into each of these rules.   Hypermedia as the Engine In the original dissertation, this constraint is buried under the Uniform Interface section,  but it’s crucial for understanding the real nature of REST APIs.  What hypermedia as the engine means in practice is that when communicating   with an API, we should be able to see what’s next by examining any link in the response.  Django REST framework, the most popular framework for building REST APIs in Django,  makes it easy to build Hypermedia APIs. In fact, Django REST framework serializers  have the ability to return hyperlinked resources. For example, a query for a List model  can return the many side of a one-to-many relationship. Listing 1-1 illustrates a JSON  response from an API where the Card model is connected with a foreign key to List.  Listing 1-1.  A JSON Response with Hyperlinked Relationships  {   "id": 8,   "title": "Doing",   "cards": [       "https:  api.example api cards 1",       "https:  api.example api cards 2",       "https:  api.example api cards 3",       "https:  api.example api cards 4"   ] }  Other examples of hyperlinked resources are pagination links. Listing 1-2 is a JSON  response for a boards resource  Board model  with hyperlinks for navigating between  results.  7   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to the deCoupled World  Listing 1-2.  A JSON Response with Pagination Links  {   "id": 4,   "title": "Doing",   "next": "https:  api.example api boards ?page=5",   "previous": "https:  api.example api boards ?page=3" }  Another interesting feature of the Django REST framework is the browsable API, a  web interface for interacting with the REST API. All these features make Django REST  framework Hypermedia APIs ready, which is the correct definition for these systems.   Client-Server Separation The second constraint, client-server separation, is easily achievable.  A REST API can expose endpoints to which consumers can connect to retrieve,   update, or delete data. In our case, consumers will be JavaScript frontends.   Stateless A compliant REST API should be stateless.  Stateless means that during the communication between client and server, the   request should not use any context data stored on the server. This doesn’t mean that we  can’t interact with the resources exposed by the REST APIs. The constraint applies to  session data, like session cookies or other means of identification stored on the server.  This strict prescription urged engineers to find new solutions for API authentication.  JSON Web Token, referred to as JWT later in the book, is a product of such research,  which is not necessarily more secure than other methods, as you will see later.   Cacheable A compliant REST API should take advantage of HTTP caching as much as possible.  HTTP caching operates through HTTP headers. A well-designed REST API should  always give the client hints about the lifetime of a GET response. To do so, the backend  sets a Cache-Control header on the response with a max-age directive, which drives the   8   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to the deCoupled World  lifespan of the response. For example, to cache a response for one hour, the server can  set the following header:  Cache-Control: max-age=3600  Most of the time, there is also an ETag header in the response, which indicates the   resource version. Listing 1-3 shows a typical HTTP response with cache headers.  Listing 1-3.  An HTTP Response with Cache Headers  200 OK Cache-Control: max-age=3600 ETag: "x6ty2xv"  Note  another method for enabling http caching involves the Last-Modified  header. If the server sets this header, the client can in turn use If-Modified-  Since or If-Unmodified-Since to check the resource’s freshness.  When the client requests the same resource and max-age is not yet expired, the   response is fetched from the browser’s cache, not from the server. If max-age has  expired, the client issues a request to the server by attaching the If-None-Match header,  alongside with the value from the ETag. This mechanism is known as a conditional  request. If the resource is still fresh, the server responds with 304 Not Modified, hence  avoiding unnecessary exchange of data. If the resource instead is stale, that is, it’s  expired, the server responds with a fresh response. It’s important to remember that  browsers cache only the following response codes:                  200 OK  301 Moved Permanently  404 Not Found  206 Partial Content  Moreover, responses with the Authorization header set aren’t cached by default,  unless the Cache-Control header includes the public directive. Also, as you will see  later, GraphQL operates mainly with POST requests, which aren’t cached by default.  9    IntroduCtIon to the deCoupled World  Chapter 1   Uniform Interface Uniform interface is one of the most important rules of REST.  One of its tenets, representations, prescribes that the communication between   client and server, for example to create a new resource on the backend, should carry the  representation of the resource itself. What this means is that if I want to create a new  resource on the backend, and I issue a POST request, I should provide a payload with the  resource.  Let’s say I have an API that accepts a command on an endpoint, but without a request   body. A REST API that creates a new resource based only on a command issued against  an endpoint is not RESTful. If we talk in terms of uniform interface and representations  instead, when we want to create a new resource on the server, we send the resource itself  in the request body. Listing 1-4 illustrates a complaint request, with a request body for  creating a new user.  Listing 1-4.  A POST Request  POST https:  api.example api users   {   "name": "Juliana",   "surname": "Crain",   "age": 44 }  Here we use JSON as the media type, and a representation of the resource as   the request body. Uniform interface refers also to the HTTP verbs used to drive the  communication from the client to the server. When we talk to a REST API, we mainly use  five methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH. These methods are also the uniform  interface, that is, the common language we use for client-server communication.  After reviewing REST principles, let’s now turn our attention to its alleged contender,  GraphQL.  10   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to the deCoupled World   An Introduction to GraphQL GraphQL appeared in 2015, proposed by Facebook, and marketed as a replacement   for REST.  GraphQL is a data query language that allows the client to precisely define what data   to fetch from the server and combine data from multiple resources in one request. In a  sense, this is what we always did with REST APIs, but GraphQL takes this a step further,  pushing more control to the client. We saw how to request data from a REST API. To get a  single user, for example, we can visit the following URL of a fictional REST API:  https:  api.example api users 4  In response, the API returns all the fields for the given user. Listing 1-5 shows a JSON  response for a single user, which also happens to have a one-to-many relationship with a  Friend model.  Listing 1-5.  A JSON Response from a REST API  {   "id": 4,   "name": "Juliana",   "surname": "Crain",   "age": 44,   "city": "London",   "occupation": "Software developer",   "friends": [       "https:  api.example api friend 1",       "https:  api.example api friend 2",       "https:  api.example api friend 3",       "https:  api.example api friend 4"   ] }  This is a contrived example, but if you imagine an even larger set of fields in the   response, it becomes clear that we are over-fetching, that is, we are requesting more data  than we need. If we think for a moment of the same API, this time implemented with  GraphQL, we can request a smaller subset of fields. To request data from a GraphQL API,   11   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to the deCoupled World  we can make a query. Listing 1-6 shows a typical GraphQL query to request a single user,  by ID, with only a subset of fields.  Listing 1-6.  A GraphQL Query  query {     getUser userID: 4  {         surname,         age     } }  {   "surname": "Crain",   "age": 44 }  As you can see, the client controls what fields it can request. Here, for example, we   skipped all fields except surname and age. This query has also an argument identified by  userID, which acts as a first filter for the query. In response to this query, the GraphQL  API returns the requested fields. Listing 1-7 shows the JSON response for our query.  Listing 1-7.  A JSON Response from the Previous Query  “No more over-fetching” is one of the main selling points for GraphQL over REST. In   reality, this filtering capability based on fields is not an exclusive of GraphQL APIs. For  example, REST APIs that follow the JSON API specification can use sparse fieldsets to  request only a subset of data. Once we issue a query against a GraphQL endpoint, this  query travels over a POST request as a request body. Listing 1-8 shows a request to a  GraphQL API.  Listing 1-8.  A GraphQL Query over a POST Request  POST https:  api.example graphql  { "query" : "query { getUser userID: 4  { surname, age } }", "variables": null }  12   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to the deCoupled World  You can already notice in this request that we call the  graphql endpoint instead of    api users 4. Also, we use POST instead of GET to retrieve the resource. This is a large  departure from the REST architectural style. Query requests in GraphQL are only half  of the story. Whereas REST uses POST, PUT, and DELETE to create, update, or remove a  resource, respectively, GraphQL has the concept of mutations as a means of altering the  data. Listing 1-9 shows a mutation for creating a new a user.  Listing 1-9.  A GraphQL Mutation  mutation {    createUser name: "Caty", surname: "Jonson"  {        name,        surname    } }  Subscriptions are another interesting feature of GraphQL services. Clients can   subscribe to events. For example, we may want to receive a notification from the server  any time a new user registers to our service. In GraphQL, we register a subscription for  this. Listing 1-10 illustrates a subscription.  Listing 1-10.  A GraphQL Subscription  subscription {    userRegistered {        name,        email    } }  What happens when a GraphQL query reaches the backend? How does the flow   compare to a REST API? Once the query lands on the backend, it is validated against a  schema, which contains type definitions. Then one or more resolvers, dedicated functions  connected to each field in the schema, assemble and return the appropriate data for the  user. Speaking of type definitions, everything is a type in GraphQL: queries, mutations,  subscriptions, and the domain entities. Each query, mutation, and entity has to be  defined in a schema before it can be used, written in a Schema Definition Language.  Listing 1-11 shows a simple schema for the queries we have seen so far.  13   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to the deCoupled World  Listing 1-11.  A Simple GraphQL Schema  type User {       name: String,       surname: String,       age: Int,       email: String }  type Query {       getUser userID: ID : User! }  type Mutation {       createUser name: String, surname: String : User }  type Subscription {       userRegistered: User }  By looking at this schema, you can immediately notice how GraphQL enforces strong   types, much like a typed language like TypeScript or C. Here, String, Int, and ID are  scalar types, while User is our custom type. These custom types go under the definition  of object types in GraphQL parlance. How does GraphQL fit in the Python ecosystem?  Nowadays, there are a number of libraries for building Pythonesque GraphQL APIs. The  most popular are as follows:     Graphene, with its code-first approach to building GraphQL services     Ariadne, a schema-first GraphQL library     Strawberry, built on top of data classes, code-first, and with type hints  All these libraries have integrations with Django. The difference between a code-first   approach and a schema-first approach to GraphQL is that the former promotes Python  syntax as a first-class citizen for writing the schema. The latter instead uses a multi-line  Python string to represent it. In Chapters 10 and 11, we work extensively with GraphQL  in Django with Ariadne and Strawberry.  14   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to the deCoupled World   Summary This chapter reviewed the fundamentals for both traditional and decoupled  architectures. You learned that:     Monoliths are systems acting as a whole unit to serve HTML and data   to the users     REST APIs are in reality Hypermedia APIs because they use HTTP as  the communication medium, and hyperlinks for providing paths to  related resources      JavaScript-first and single-page apps are not the perfect solution to  every use case     GraphQL is a strong contender for REST  In the next chapter, we dive deep into the JavaScript ecosystem to see how it fits   within Django.   Additional Resources     REST, Hypermedia & HATEOAS     HTTP Caching tutorial  15   CHAPTER 2  JavaScript Meets Django  This chapter covers:     How JavaScript fits into Django  JavaScript ecosystem and tooling          JavaScript frontend libraries and frameworks  Despite its reputation of being a toy language, JavaScript has become a mature tool   in recent years.  For bad or good, JavaScript is everywhere these days. JavaScript tooling has grown  exponentially as well, with new libraries and techniques pouring fast in the ecosystem.  In this chapter, we introduce the modern JavaScript scene. You will understand what  JavaScript tools do, and how they fit within Django. We also take a look at the most  popular frontend libraries and frameworks.   JavaScript and Django in Production To better understand how modern JavaScript fits into Django, we should think not only of a  local development environment, but first and foremost of the typical production context. Django in production is a different beast from its development counterpart. First,  Django in development has a local server that can serve static files, that is, JavaScript,  images, and CSS. However, the same development server can’t handle production  loads, let alone the security around a production setup. For this reason, in a production  environment, we usually employ the following components:     The Django project itself  an SSL termination     A reverse proxy, such as NGINX, to serve static files, which also acts as      A WSGI or ASGI server, such as Gunicorn, Uvicorn, or Hypercorn    more on ASGI in the next chapter     Valentino Gagliardi 2021  V. Gagliardi, Decoupled Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-7144-5_2  17   Chapter 2    JavaSCript MeetS DJango  How does JavaScript fit into this? When we deploy Django on a production server,  we run python manage.py collectstatic to group static files for all the Django apps  in a single place, identified by the STATIC_ROOT configuration variable. To put things in  context, suppose we have a Django project with an app named quote and a JavaScript  file in ~ repo-root quote static quote js index.js. Assuming we configured  STATIC_ROOT as follows, where  home user static  is an existing folder on the  production server:  STATIC_ROOT = " home user static "  When we run python manage.py collectstatic, static files land in  home user   static , ready to get picked up by any Django template that references the static  template tag. For this to work, the STATIC_URL configuration must point to the URL  used for serving static files. In our example, we imagine a subdomain named static. decoupled-django.com:  STATIC_URL = "https:  static.decoupled-django.com "  This URL is usually served by an NGINX virtual host, with a location block pointing   at the value configured in Django’s STATIC_ROOT. Listing 2-1 illustrates how you would  call a static file  JavaScript in this case  from a Django template.  Listing 2-1.  A Django Template Referencing a Static File  {% load static %}        Hello Django!             In the actual HTML, the URL becomes:      18   Chapter 2    JavaSCript MeetS DJango  This is the most simple situation, where we have one or more Django apps, each   with its own JavaScript files. This approach works well for tiny apps, where the JavaScript  code for the entry point of the application fits within the 200KB limit. By entry point  in this context, we mean the first JavaScript file that the browser has to download to  kickstart the whole application. Since this book is about “decoupled Django” we need to  think about more complex setups where the JavaScript payload served to the user could  go well over 200KB. Also, the bigger a JavaScript application grows, the more we need  to structure our code in a modular fashion, which leads us to talk about JavaScript ES  modules and module bundlers.   The Need for Module Bundlers Up until 2015, JavaScript didn’t have a standard module system on the frontend.  Whereas Node.js always had require   from the beginning, the situation was really  scattered on the frontend with different and competing approaches like AMD modules,  UMD, and CommonJS.  Finally, in 2015, ES modules landed in ECMAScript. ES modules offer a standard   approach to code reuse in JavaScript, while also enabling powerful patterns like  dynamic import for improving performances in bigger applications. Now, the problem  for a typical frontend project is that ES modules are not the only asset available to the  developer. There are images, style files such as CSS or SASS, and different types of  JavaScript modules to include. Let’s also not forget that ES modules are a rather new  artifact, and traditional module formats are still out there. A JavaScript project might  use new libraries based on ES modules, but need as well to include code distributed as  CommonJS. Moreover, ES modules are not supported by older browsers.  Another challenge for modern frontend developers lies in the size of a typical   JavaScript application, especially when the project requires a lot of dependencies. To  overcome these issues, specialized tools known as module bundlers saw the light. The  goals of a module bundler are manifold. This tool can:     Assemble different types of JavaScript modules into the same   application          Include different types of files and assets in a JavaScript project  Improve the performance of the application with a technique known  as code splitting  19   Chapter 2    JavaSCript MeetS DJango  In brief, module bundlers offer a unified interface for collecting all the dependencies   of a frontend project, assembling them, and producing one or more JavaScript files  called bundles, in addition to any other asset  CSS and images  for the final application.  One of the most popular module bundlers these days is webpack, which is also used in  the most important CLI tools for project scaffolding in the JavaScript land  create-react-  app, Vue CLI . In the next section, we explore why webpack is important for the Django  developer who needs to deal with a lot of JavaScript.   Webpack Fights Django  the Need for Code Splitting  Code splitting in JavaScript refers to the ability to serve the minimum amount possible of  JavaScript to the client, while loading all the rest on-demand.  An understanding of code splitting is not strictly necessary for the average Django   developer, but Python teams approaching medium to bigger Django projects that  require a lot of interactivity in the frontend must know about this concept. In the  previous sections, I mentioned a theoretical limit of 200KB for the entry point of a  JavaScript application. Near to this number, we risk offering a terrible navigation  experience. JavaScript has a cost for any device, but the performance degradation  becomes even more dramatic on low-end devices and slow networks  I suggest always  keeping an eye on “The Cost of JavaScript” by Addy Osmani, link in the resources . For  this reason, it’s of utmost importance to apply a series of techniques to the final artifact.  One such technique is code minification, where the final JavaScript code is stripped out  of comments, whitespace, and while functions, and variable names are mangled. This  is a well-known optimization that almost any tool can accomplish. But a more powerful  technique, exclusive of modern module bundlers, called code splitting, can shrink down  the resulting JavaScript files even more. Code splitting in a JavaScript application applies  at various levels:     At the route level     At the component level     On user interactions  dynamic import   To some extent, CLI tools like Vue CLI and create-react-app already offer sane   defaults out of the box when it comes to code splitting. In these tools, webpack is already  configured to produce efficient output, thanks to a basic form of code splitting known as  vendor splitting. The effect of code splitting on a JavaScript application is visible in the   20   following example. This is the result of running npm run build on a minimal project  configured as a single-page application:  Chapter 2    JavaSCript MeetS DJango  js chunk-vendors.468a5298.js js app.24e08b96.js  Subsequent slices of the application, called chunks, land in different files than the   main entry point, and can be loaded in parallel. You can see here that we have two files,  app.24e08b96.js and chunk-vendors.468a5298. The js. app.24e08b96.js file is the  entry point of the application. When the application loads, the entry point requires the  second chunk, named chunk-vendors.468a5298.js. When you see vendors in a chunk  name, it’s a sign that webpack is doing the most basic form of code splitting: vendor  splitting. Vendor dependencies are libraries like lodash and React, which are potentially  included in multiple places across a project. To prevent dependency duplication,  webpack can be instructed to recognize what is in common between the consumers of  a dependency, and splits the common dependencies into single chunks. Another thing  you can notice from these file names is the hash. In app.24e08b96.js, for example, the  hash is 24e08b96, which is calculated from the file content by the module bundler. When  the content of the file changes, the hash changes as well. The important thing to keep in  mind is that the order in which the entry point and the chunks appear in the script tag  is paramount for the app to work. Listing 2-2 shows how our files should appear in the  HTML markup.  Listing 2-2.  Two Chunks As They Appear in the HTML             Here, chunk-vendors.468a5298.js must come before app.24e08b96.js, because  chunk-vendors.468a5298.js contains one or more dependencies for the entry point.  Keeping our focus on Django, you can imagine that to inject these chunks in the same  exact order, we need some system for pairing the appearance order of each file with the  static tag in our templates. A Django library called django-webpack-loader was meant  to ease the usage of webpack within Django projects, but when webpack 4 came out with  a new configuration for code splitting, splitChunks, django-webpack-loader stopped  working.  21   Chapter 2    JavaSCript MeetS DJango  The takeaway here is that JavaScript tooling moves faster than anything else, and  it’s not easy for package maintainers to keep up with the latest changes. Also, messing  up with the webpack configuration is a luxury not everybody can afford, not counting  the risk of configuration drift and breaking changes. When in doubt, before fighting  webpack or touching its configuration, use this mini-heuristic to decide what to do: if the  JavaScript section of an app is over 200KB, use the appropriate CLI tooling and serve the  application as a single-page app within a Django template, or as a decoupled SPA. We  will explore the first approach in Chapter 5. If the JavaScript code fits within the 200KB  limit instead, and the amount of interactive interactions are low, use a simple    tag to load what you need, or if you want to use modern JavaScript, configure a simple  webpack pipeline with vendor splitting at least. Having outlined the foundations of  module bundlers, let’s now continue our tour of the modern JavaScript tooling.  Note  JavaScript tooling, and webpack in particular, are too much of a moving  target to cover in a book without the risk of providing outdated instructions. For this  reason, i don't cover the setup of a webpack project here. You can find a link to an  example of such a setup in the resources.   Modern JavaScript, Babel, and Webpack As developers we are quite fortunate, because most of the time we have access to fast  Internet connections, powerful machines with many cores, plenty of RAM, and modern  browsers.  If this shiny new snippet of JavaScript works on my machine, then it should work   virtually everywhere, right? It’s easy to understand the appeal of writing modern  JavaScript. Consider the following example, based on ECMAScript 5:  var arr = ["a", "b"]; function includes arr, element  {   return arr.indexOf element  !== -1; }  22   Chapter 2    JavaSCript MeetS DJango  This function checks if a given element is present in an array. It is based on Array.  prototype.indexOf  , a built-in function for arrays, which returns -1 if the given  element is not found in the target list. Now consider instead the following snippet, based  on ECMAScript 2016:  const arr = ["a", "b"]; const result = arr.includes "c" ;  The second example is clearly more concise, understandable, and palatable for   developers. The drawback is that older browsers don’t understand Array.prototype. includes   or const. We can’t ship this code as it is.  Tip  Both caniuse.com and the compatibility tables at developer.mozilla. org are invaluable resources for understanding if a given target browser supports  modern syntax.  Luckily, fewer and fewer developers need to worry about the dreaded Internet   Explorer 11, but there are still a lot of edge cases to take into account. As of today, the  most compatible JavaScript version is ECMAScript 2009  ES5 , which is a safe target.  To keep both JavaScript developers and users happy, the community came up with  a category of tools called transpilers, of which Babel is the most popular incarnation.  With such a tool at our disposal, we can write modern JavaScript code, pass it into a  transpilation compilation pipeline, and have compatible JavaScript code as the final  product. In a typical setup, we configure a build pipeline where:    1.  Webpack ingests ES modules written in modern JavaScript.    2.  A webpack loader passes the code through Babel.    3.  Babel transpiles the code.  The webpack Babel duo is ubiquitous these days, used by create-react-app, Vue CLI,   and more.   A Word on TypeScript TypeScript is the elephant in the room for most developers.  23   Chapter 2    JavaSCript MeetS DJango  As a statically typed declination of JavaScript, TypeScript is more similar to languages   like C or Java. It is widespread in the Angular world, and it is conquering more and  more JavaScript libraries, which now ship with type definitions by default. Whether you  like TypeScript or not, it is a tool to keep in consideration. In Chapters 8, 11, and 12, we  work with TypeScript in React.   JavaScript Frontend Libraries and Frameworks The JavaScript landscape has changed dramatically over the years. jQuery still owns a  large market share.  But when it comes to client-side applications, these are being written or rewritten  with modern frontend libraries like React and Vue.js, or full-fledged frameworks like  Angular. Django is mostly powered by HTML templates, but when the time comes it can  be paired with virtually any JavaScript library. These days the scene is dominated by  three competitors:     React, the UI library from Facebook, which popularized  but not   pioneered  a component-based approach to writing interfaces     Vue.js, the progressive UI library from Evan You, former Angular   developer, which shines for its progressiveness     Angular, the battery-included framework, based on TypeScript  Of this trio, Vue.js is the most progressive. Angular has more batteries included  just  like Django , but has a steep learning curve. React instead is the most liberal because it  does not impose any constraint on the developer. You pick whatever library you need.  Whether this is an advantage or not, I leave the opinion for you. What is important  to keep in mind is that the core UI library is just the starting point for a number of  dependencies to solve another set of problems that arise when writing medium to bigger  client-side applications. In particular, you will sooner or later need:     A state management library     A routing library     A schema validation library     A form validation library  24   Chapter 2    JavaSCript MeetS DJango  Each UI library has its own orbit of satellite sub-libraries to handle the   aforementioned concerns. React leans on Redux or Mobx  and more recently also on  Recoil.js  for state management, and on React Router for routing. Vue.js uses Vuex  for state management, and Vue Router for routing. Angular has a bunch of different  approaches to state management, but NgRx is the most widespread. Ultimately, all these  libraries and frameworks can work well as external clients for Django, paired either as:     Client-side applications fetching data from a Django REST GraphQL   API  content source     Server-side rendered or static site generators with Django as a   We explore both topics in more detail later in the book. In the next section, we take a   quick look at some alternatives to the traditional single-page approach.   Lightweight JavaScript UI Libraries Other than Angular, Vue, React, and Svelte, there is a growing number of lightweight  JavaScript mini-frameworks, born to ease the most mundane tasks on the frontend and  to provide just enough JavaScript to get going.  In this category we can mention the following tools:     AlpineJS     Hotwire     Htmx  Hotwire is a set of tooling and techniques popularized by Ruby on Rails and its   creator, David Heinemeier Hansson. At the time of this writing, there is experimental  work called turbo-django aiming at porting these techniques into Django. Along the  same lines there is also a new Django framework called django-unicorn. All these tools  offer a less JavaScript-heavy approach to building interactive interfaces. They will be  worth a look once they start to gain traction in the wild.  25   Chapter 2    JavaSCript MeetS DJango   Universal JavaScript Applications Node.js is an environment for running JavaScript code outside of browsers. This means  servers and CLI tools.  The majority of the tools we mentioned in this chapter are JavaScript-based, and   since they run on the command line, they need a JavaScript environment, which Node. js provides. Now, if you pair this with frontend libraries that are capable of running on  any JavaScript environment, not only browsers  like React and Vue.js , you obtain a  particular breed of JavaScript tooling that is taking the scene by storm with a JavaScript-  centric approach to server-side rendering.  We already mentioned server-side rendering in Chapter 1, when talking about  MVC web frameworks. In contrast to traditional server-side rendering, where the  HTML and the data is generated by a server-side language like Ruby, Python, or Java,  in the JavaScript-centric approach to server-side rendering, everything is generated by  JavaScript on Node.js. What does this mean for the end user and for the developer? The  main difference between a client-side application based on JavaScript and a server-side  rendered app is that the latter generates the HTML before sending it to the user, or to the  search engine crawler. This approach has a number of advantages over pure client-side  applications:          It improves SEO for content-heavy websites  It improves performances, since the main rendering effort is pushed  to the server  For the developer instead, universal JavaScript applications are the holy grail of code   reuse since everything can be written in a single language, JavaScript. The reasoning  behind these tools and the motivations for using them are roughly the following:     We already have a big client-side app and we want to improve its   performances, both for the end user and for crawlers     We have a lot of common code between the frontend and the Node.js   backend, and we want to reuse it  However, as with any technology, universal JavaScript applications have their own   drawbacks. For a Django shop focused on Python and maybe a sprinkle of JavaScript  with React or Vue.js, maintaining a parallel architecture based on Node.js can be taxing.  These setups need a Node.js server in order to run, with all the maintenance burden and   26   complexity it entails. Platforms like Vercel and Netlifly ease the deployments of these  architectures, but there are still things to keep in mind. The most popular tools available  today for creating universal JavaScript applications are:  Chapter 2    JavaSCript MeetS DJango     Next.js for React     Nuxt.js for Vue.js     Angular Universal for Angular  There are probably a million more tools out there. In Chapter 7, we focus on Next.js.   Static Site Generators While the approach to server-side rendering offered by tools like Next.js and Nuxt.js  is indeed interesting, static site generation should be the first choice in all those cases  where search engine optimization is paramount and there is little to no JavaScript-driven  interaction on certain pages  think of a blog, for example .  The current scenario for static site generation with JavaScript includes:     Gatsby     Next.js for React     Nuxt.js for Vue.js     Scully for Angular  Next.js and Nuxt.js can work in two modes: server-side rendering and static site   generation. To source data from the backend, these tools offer interfaces for making plain  HTTP requests to a REST API, or alternatively GraphQL. Gatsby instead makes exclusive  use of GraphQL, and might not be the right tool for every team.   Testing Tooling The whole Chapter 8 is devoted to testing Django and JavaScript applications. In this  section, we briefly introduce the most popular testing tools for JavaScript. They fall into  the conventional categorizations of testing.  27   Chapter 2    JavaSCript MeetS DJango  Unit testing:      Jest  End-to-end testing:     Cypress     Puppeteer by Google     Playwright by Microsoft  For unit testing and integration testing between multiple units, Jest is the most   popular tool to this date. It can test pure JavaScript code and React Vue.js components  as well. For end-to-end testing and functional testing, Cypress is the most feature-  complete test runner, and plays well with Django too, with Puppeteer and Playwright  gaining traction. Truth be told, Jest and Cypress can be thought more as wrappers  around existing testing libraries: Jest builds on top of Jasmine, while Cypress builds on  top of Mocha, as they borrow a high number of methods from these libraries. However,  their popularity is sparked by the fluent testing API they provide, in contrast to more  traditional tools.   Other Ancillary JavaScript Tools I would be remiss not to mention ancillary JavaScript tools, so important for the modern  JavaScript developer.  In both the Python and JavaScript land, there are code linters. For JavaScript, ESLint   is the most widespread. Then we have code formatters like Prettier. At the intersection  between pure JavaScript code and design systems we find Storybook, a powerful tool  for building design systems. Storybook is used widely in the React and React Native  community, but compatible with the most popular frontend libraries like Vue and Svelte.  Together with testing tools, linters, formatters, and UI tools make a powerful arsenal for  every JavaScript and Django developer.  28   Chapter 2    JavaSCript MeetS DJango   Summary This chapter explored the boundaries of Django and client-side applications.

They built a lot of stuff and tried   the mini-framework approach à la Flask, but in the end, they always returned to Django  simply because it is opinionated, and it offers all the tools for building full-stack web  applications with Python. The Django REST Framework is a Django package that follows  the same pragmatic approach. In this chapter, we compare the Django REST Framework  to Django, and we explore the asynchronous Django landscape.   What Is the Django REST Framework? The Django REST Framework  DRF for short  is a Django package for building Web APIs.  Despite the rapid spread of GraphQL and the emergence of asynchronous micro-  frameworks like Starlette and FastAPI, the DRF still powers thousands of web services.  The DRF integrates seamlessly with Django to complement its features for building REST  APIs. In particular it offers an array of ready-made components:     Class-based REST views     Viewsets     Serializers    Valentino Gagliardi 2021  V. Gagliardi, Decoupled Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-7144-5_3  31   Chapter 3    Modern django and the django reSt FraMework  This chapter isn’t intended as a guide to the DRF for beginners, but it is worth   spending some words to go over the main building blocks of this package. In the next  sections, we explore these components, since they will be the Lego blocks for the first  part of our decoupled Django project.   Class-Based Views in Django and the DRF When building web applications, some common patterns for handling data insertion  and data listing repeat over and over.   Consider an HTML form for example. There are three distinct phases to take account      Displaying the form, either empty or with initial data     Validating the user input and showing eventual errors     Saving the data to the database  It would be foolish to copy-paste the same code again and again in our projects. For   this reason, Django offers a convenient abstraction around common patterns in web  development. These classes go under the name of class-based view, or CBV for short.  Some examples of CBV in Django are CreateView, ListView, DeleteView, UpdateView,  and DetailView. As you might have noticed, the naming of these classes goes hand  in hand with the CRUD pattern, so common in REST APIs and in traditional web  applications. In particular:  The Django REST Framework follows the same convention and offers a wide toolbox   CreateView and UpdateView for POST requests  ListView and DetailView for GET requests  DeleteView for DELETE requests  of class-based views for REST API development:  CreateAPIView for POST requests  ListAPIView and RetrieveAPIView for GET requests  DestroyAPIView for DELETE requests  UpdateAPIView for PUT and PATCH requests  of:  32                               Chapter 3    Modern django and the django reSt FraMework  In addition, you can peruse a combination of CBVs for retrieve delete   operations like RetrieveDestroyAPIView, or for retrieve update destroy like  RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView. You will use a lot of these CBVs in your decoupled  Django projects to speed up development of the most common tasks, although the DRF  offers a more powerful layer on top of CBVs, called viewsets.  Tip  For a complete list of class-based views in django, see ccbv.co.uk. For the  django reSt Framework, see cdrf.co.   CRUD Viewsets in DRF In Chapter 1, we reviewed the concept of resources as one of the main building blocks of  REST.  In the MVC Framework, operations on resources are handled by a controller that   exposes methods for CRUD verbs. We also clarified that Django is an MVT Framework,  rather than MVC. In Django and the DRF, we use class-based views to expose common  CRUD operations in terms of GET, POST, PUT, and so on. Nevertheless, the Django REST  Framework offers a clever abstraction over class-based views, called viewsets, which  make the DRF look more “resourceful” than ever. Listing 3-1 shows a viewset, specifically  a ModelViewSet.  Listing 3-1.  A ModelViewSet in DRF  from rest_framework import viewsets from .models import Blog, BlogSerializer  class BlogViewSet viewsets.ModelViewSet :    queryset = Blog.objects.all      serializer_class = BlogSerializer  Such a viewset gives you all the methods for handling common CRUD operations for   free. Table 3-1 summarizes the relationship between viewset methods, HTTP methods,  and CRUD operations.  33   Chapter 3    Modern django and the django reSt FraMework  Table 3-1.  Relationship Between Viewset Methods, HTTP Methods, and CRUD  Operations  Viewset Methods  HTTP Method  CRUD Operation  list     retrieve    create    update    destroy    update    POST  GET  PUT  DELETE  PATCH  Create resource  Retrieve resource s   Update resource  Delete resource  partial update resource  Once you have a viewset, it’s only a matter of wiring up the class with an   urlpatterns. Listing 3-2 shows the urls.py for the previous viewset.  Listing 3-2.  Viewset and Urlpatterns in Django REST  from .views import BlogViewSet from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter  router = DefaultRouter   router.register r"blog", BlogViewSet, basename="blog"  urlpatterns = router.urls  As you can see, with a minimal amount of code you have the complete collection of   CRUD operations, with the corresponding URLs.   Models, Forms, and Serializers The ability to create pages and forms with little or no code at all is what makes Django  shine.  Thanks to model forms, for example, it takes a couple of lines of code to create a   form starting from a Django model, complete with validation and error handling, ready  to be included in a view. When you are in a hurry, you can even assemble a CreateView,  which takes exactly three lines of code  at least  to produce the HTML form for a model,  attached to the corresponding template. If Django model forms are the bridge between  the end user and the database, serializers in the Django REST Framework are the bridge   34   Chapter 3    Modern django and the django reSt FraMework  between the end user, our REST API, and Django models. Serializers are in charge of  serialization and deserialization of Python objects, and they can be thought of as model  forms for JSON. Consider the model shown in Listing 3-3.  Listing 3-3.  A Django Model  class Quote models.Model :     client = models.ForeignKey to=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,    on_delete=models.CASCADE      proposal_text = models.TextField blank=True   From this model, we can make a DRF model serializer, shown in Listing 3-4.  Listing 3-4.  A DRF Serializer  class QuoteSerializer serializers.ModelSerializer :    class Meta:        model = Quote        fields = ["client", "proposal_text"]  When we hit a DRF endpoint, the serializer converts the underlying model instances  to JSON before any output is shown to the user. Vice versa, when we make a POST request  against a DRF view, the serializer converts our JSON to the corresponding Python  object, not before validating the input. Serializers can also express model relationships.  In Listing 3-4, Quote is connected to the custom user model through a many-to-one  relationship. In our serializer we can expose this relationship as an hyperlink, as shown  in Listing 3-5  remember hypermedia APIs? .  Listing 3-5.  A DRF Serializer  class QuoteSerializer serializers.ModelSerializer :    client = serializers.HyperlinkedRelatedField         read_only=True, view_name="users-detail"          class Meta:        model = Quote        fields = ["client", "proposal_text"]  35   Chapter 3    Modern django and the django reSt FraMework  This will produce the JSON output shown in Listing 3-6.  Listing 3-6.  A JSON Response with Relationships  [    {      "client": "https:  api.example api users 1",      "proposal_text": "Django quotation system"    },    {      "client": "https:  api.example api users 2",      "proposal_text": "Django school management system"    } ]  In Chapter 6, we use serializers to decouple our Django project. Having outlined   the building blocks of the DRF, let’s now explore the wonderful world of asynchronous  Django.   From WSGI to ASGI WSGI is the lingua franca of web servers to Python communication, that is, a protocol  that enables the back and forth between web servers such as Gunicorn, and the  underlying Python application.  As anticipated in Chapter 2, Django needs a web server to run efficiently in   production. Usually, a reverse proxy such as NGINX acts as the main entry point for  the end user. A Python WSGI server listens for requests behind NGINX and acts as a  bridge between the HTTP request and the Django application. Everything happens  synchronously in WSGI, and there was no way to rewrite the protocol without  introducing breaking changes. That led the community  for this tremendous work  we must thank Andrew Godwin  to write a new protocol, called ASGI, for running  asynchronous Python applications under ASGI-capable web servers. To run Django  asynchronously, and we are going to see what that means in the next section, we need  an asynchronous-capable server. You can choose Daphne, Hypercorn, or Uvicorn. In our  example, we will use Uvicorn.  36   Chapter 3    Modern django and the django reSt FraMework   Getting Started with Asynchronous Django Asynchronous code is all about non-blocking execution. This is the magic behind  platforms like Node.js, which predated the realm of high throughput services for years.  The asynchronous Python landscape instead has always been fragmented, with   many PEPs and competing implementations before the arrival of async await in  Python 3.5  2015 . Asynchronicity in Django was a dream, until Django 3.0, when  seminal support for the aforementioned ASGI found its way into the core. Asynchronous  views  Django 3.1  are one of the most exciting additions to Django in recent years. To  understand what problem asynchronicity solves in Django, and in Python in general,  consider a simple Django view. When the user reaches this view, we fetch a list of links  from an external service, as shown in Listing 3-7.  Listing 3-7.  A Synchronous View Doing Network Calls  from django.http import JsonResponse import httpx  client = httpx.Client base_url="https:  api.valentinog.com demo"   def list_links _request :     links = client.get " sleep " .json       json_response = {"links": links}     return JsonResponse data=json_response   This should immediately raise a red flag. It can run fast, really fast, or take forever to  complete, leaving the browser hanging. Due to the single-threaded nature of the Python  interpreter, our code runs in sequential steps. In our view, we can’t return the response  to the user until the API call completes. In fact my link, https:  api.valentinog.com  demo sleep , is configured to sleep for 10 seconds before returning the result. In other  words, our view is blocking. Here httpx, the Python HTTP client I use to make requests,  is configured with a safe timeout and will raise an exception after a few seconds, but not  every library has this sort of security in place.  Any IO-bound operation can potentially starve resources or block the whole   execution. Traditionally, to overcome this problem in Django, we would use a task  queue, a component that runs in the background, picks up tasks to execute, and returns  the result later. The most popular task queues for Django are Celery and Django  Q. Task queues are highly suggested for IO-bound operations like sending emails,   37   Chapter 3    Modern django and the django reSt FraMework  running scheduled jobs, HTTP requests, or for CPU-bound operations that need to  run on multiple cores. Asynchronous views in Django don’t completely replace task  queues, especially for CPU-bound operations. Django Q for example uses Python  multiprocessing. For non-critical IO-bound operations instead, like HTTP calls or  sending emails, Django asynchronous views are great. In the most simple case, you  can send out an email or call an external API without incurring the risk of blocking the  user interface. So what’s in an asynchronous Django view? Let’s rewrite the previous  example with an asynchronous view in a way that the httpx client retrieves data in the  background; see Listing 3-8.  Listing 3-8.  An Asynchronous View Doing Network Calls, This Time Safely  from django.http import HttpResponse import httpx import asyncio  async def get_links  :    base_url = "https:  api.valentinog.com demo"    client = httpx.AsyncClient base_url=base_url, timeout=15     response = await client.get " sleep"     json_response = response.json       Do something with the response or with the json    await client.aclose    async def list_links _request :    asyncio.create_task get_links       response = " Fetching links in background "    return HttpResponse response   If you never worked with asynchronous Python and Django, there are a few new   concepts worth clarifying in this code. First of all, we import asyncio, the bridge between  us and the asynchronous Python world. We then declare a first asynchronous function  with async def. In this first function, get_links  , we use the asynchronous httpx  client with a timeout of 15 seconds. Since we are going to run this call in the background,  we can safely increase the timeout. Next up, we use await in front of client.get  .  Finally, we close the client with client.aclose  . To avoid leaving resources open, you  can also use the asynchronous client with an asynchronous context manager. In this  case, we can refactor to async with, as shown in Listing 3-9.  38   Chapter 3    Modern django and the django reSt FraMework  Listing 3-9.  Using an Asynchronous Context Manager  async def get_links  :    base_url = "https:  api.valentinog.com demo"    async with httpx.AsyncClient base_url=base_url, timeout=15  as client:        response = await client.get " sleep"         json_response = response.json           Do something with the json ...  Tip  an asynchronous context manager is one that implements __aenter__ and  __aexit__ instead of __enter__ and __exit__.  In the second asynchronous function list_links  , our Django view, we use   asyncio.create_task   to run get_links   in the background. This is the real news.  async def in a Django view is the most notable change from a developer’s perspective.  For users instead, the most evident benefit is that they don’t have to wait to see the  HTML if the execution takes longer than expected. In the scenario we imagined  previously, for example, we can send the results to the user later with an email message.  This is one of the most compelling use cases for asynchronous views in Django. But it  doesn’t stop here. To recap, things you can do now that asynchronous Django is a thing:     Efficiently execute multiple HTTP requests in parallel in a view     Schedule long-running tasks      Interact safely with external systems  There are still things missing before Django and the DRF become 100%   asynchronous—the ORM and the Django REST views are not asynchronous—but we will  use asynchronous Django capabilities here and there in our decoupled project to practice.   Competing Asynchronous Frameworks and the DRF At the time of writing, the Django REST Framework has no support for asynchronous  views.  In light of this, wouldn’t it be better to use something like FastAPI or Starlette for   building asynchronous web services? Starlette is an ASGI framework built by Tom  Christie, the DRF creator. FastAPI instead builds on top of Starlette and offers a stellar   39   Chapter 3    Modern django and the django reSt FraMework  developer tooling for building asynchronous Web APIs. Both are excellent choices for  greenfield projects, and luckily you don’t have to choose, because FastAPI can run within  Django itself, thanks to experimental projects like django-ninja, while we wait for  asynchronous DRF.   Summary This chapter reviewed the fundamentals of the Django REST Framework and covered  how to run a simple asynchronous Django view. You learned:     What are the DRF class-based views, viewsets, and serializers     How to create and asynchronous Django view     How to run Django under Uvicorn  In the next chapter, we analyze in detail the patterns for decoupling Django, while in   Chapter 6, we finally get hands on with Django and JavaScript frontends.   Additional Resource     Asynchronous Django, a playlist  40   CHAPTER 4  Advantages and   Disadvantages of   Decoupled Architectures  In this chapter, we outline various approaches for decoupling a Django project. In  particular, we cover:     Hybrid architectures     Fully decoupled architectures based on REST and GraphQL     Advantages and disadvantages of both styles  By the end of the chapter you should be able to discern and apply with success one   or more decoupling styles to your next Django project.   Pseudo-Decoupled Django Pseudo-decoupled, or hybrid decoupling, is an approach in which a static frontend is  augmented with a sprinkle of JavaScript; just enough to make things interactive and  playful for the end user.  In the next two sections, we go over the perks and drawbacks of a pseudo-decoupled   setup by examining two different approaches: without REST and with REST.   Pseudo-Decoupled Without REST Depending on how long you have been programming, you will begin to notice that there  is a category of patterns recurring over and over when building web applications: data  fetching and form handling.    Valentino Gagliardi 2021  V. Gagliardi, Decoupled Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-7144-5_4  41   Chapter 4    advantages and disadvantages of deCoupled arChiteCtures    For example, you might have a page for inserting new data in your Django   application. How you handle data insertion is up to the user requirements, but basically  you have two choices:     Handle the form exclusively with Django     Handle the form with JavaScript  Django forms and model forms are great with their ability to generate the fields for  you, but most of the time we want to intercept the classic GET POST Redirect pattern of  form handling, in particular the submit event of forms. To do so, we introduce a little  JavaScript into the Django templates. Listing 4-1 shows such an example.  Listing 4-1.  JavaScript Logic for Form Handling  {% block script %}             const form = document.getElementById "reply-create" ;        form.addEventListener 'submit', function  event  {             event.preventDefault  ;            const formData = new FormData this ;             fetch "{% url "support:reply-create" %}", {                method: 'POST',                body: formData            } .then response => {                if  !response.ok  throw Error response.statusText ;                return response;            } .then    => {                location.reload  ;                window.scrollTo {top:0} ;            } ;        } ; {% endblock %}  In this example, we tie JavaScript to the form so that when the user submits the data,   the default event for the form is intercepted and stopped. Next up we build a FormData  object, which is sent to a Django CreateView. Notice also how we can use Django’s url   42   Chapter 4    advantages and disadvantages of deCoupled arChiteCtures    template tag to build the URL for Fetch. For this example to work, the form must have a  CSRF token included, as shown in Listing 4-2.  Listing 4-2.  Django’s CSRF Token Template Tag       {% csrf_token %}         If the token is outside the form, or for any other POST request not coming directly   from the form, the CSRF token must be included in the XHR request header. The example  outlined here is just one of the many use cases for JavaScript into a Django template. As  touched briefly in Chapter 2, we are seeing a Cambrian explosion of micro-frameworks  for adding just enough interactivity to Django templates. There is not enough space to  cover every possible example in this book. Here we focus on the broader architecture  to examine advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Figure 4-1 shows a  representation of pseudo-decoupled Django without REST.  DJANGO  REQUEST  DJANGO  APP  DJANGO  APP  TEMPLATE S   JAVASCRIPT  TEMPLATE S   JAVASCRIPT  RESPONSE  Figure 4-1.  A pseudo-decoupled Django project can have one or more apps, each  with its own templates. JavaScript is blended into templates and talks to regular  Django views  Keeping in mind what Django has to offer in terms of development speed, in the case   of a pseudo-decoupled, or hybrid, approach, what do we gain and what do we lose?  43   Chapter 4    advantages and disadvantages of deCoupled arChiteCtures       Authentication and cookies: Since we serve JavaScript from   within Django templates we don’t need to worry about complex  authentication methods. We can use the built-in session auth. Also,  in a pseudo-decoupled setup, cookies are free to travel over each  request on the same domain.     Forms: Django has an amazing form system that saves tons of time  during development. In a pseudo-decoupled setup, we can still use  Django forms to build up the HTML structure for data insertion, with  just enough JavaScript to make them interactive.     What JS library? In a pseudo-decoupled setup, we can use any   lightweight frontend library that doesn’t require a build pipeline,  such as Vue.js, or even better, vanilla JavaScript. If we know  beforehand what user agent we’re going to target, we can serve  modern JavaScript syntax without a transpilation step.     Routing: Django is in charge of routing and URL building. No need to  worry about JavaScript routing libraries or weird issues with the back  button of the browser.     Search engine optimization: For content-heavy websites, a pseudo-   decoupled setup is often the safest choice, as long as we don’t  generate critical contents dynamically with JavaScript.     Developer productivity burden: In a hybrid setup, the amount of  JavaScript is hopefully so low that we don’t need complex build  tooling. Everything is still Django-centric, and the cognitive load for  the developer is low.     Testing: Testing JavaScript interactions in the context of a Django  application has been always tricky. Selenium for Python doesn’t  support automatic waiting. There are a number of tools, mostly  wrappers around Selenium, like Splinter, that have this capability.  However, testing a pseudo-decoupled Django frontend without a  JavaScript-capable test runner can be still cumbersome. Tools like  Cypress, which we cover in Chapter 9, play really well with Django to  ease the burden of testing JavaScript-enriched interfaces.  44   Chapter 4    advantages and disadvantages of deCoupled arChiteCtures     Pseudo-Decoupled with REST Not every application must be architected as a single-page application, and since the  beginning of this book we stressed this point.  Over-engineered applications are the root of all evil, to play along the lines of Donald   Knuth. However, there are hybrid situations where the UI requires a lot of JavaScript  interactivity, more than a simple form handling, but we still don’t want to leave Django’s  umbrella. In these configurations you will find it reasonable to introduce JavaScript  libraries like Vue.js or React into a Django project. While Vue.js is highly progressive, it  doesn’t want to take control of all the page. React forces the developer to do everything  in React. In these situations the Django frontend, made out of templates and augmented  with Forms or Model Forms, can lose importance in favor of a pseudo-decoupled setup,  whereby:     The frontend of one or more Django apps is built entirely with   JavaScript     The backend exposes a REST API  The difference between such a setup and an architecture where the frontend is on  a different domain origin from the REST API is that in a pseudo-decoupled setup, we  serve the SPA frontend and the REST API from within the same Django project. This  has a number of positive side effects. Why introduce REST in such a setup? A Django  CreateView and a Model work well up to a certain point, after which we don’t want  to reinvent the wheel, like JSON serialization for models. Django REST paired with a  modern frontend library is a solid ground for robust decoupled projects. Figure 4-2  shows a representation of pseudo-decoupled Django with REST.  45   Chapter 4    advantages and disadvantages of deCoupled arChiteCtures    DJANGO  REQUEST  DJANGO APP  DRF REST API  DJANGO APP  DRF REST API  RESPONSE  SPA  SPA  Figure 4-2.  A pseudo-decoupled Django project with REST can have one or more  apps, each with its own REST API. JavaScript is served as a single-page application  inside the Django project and talks to Django REST views  In the next chapter, we see a practical example of a pseudo-decoupled setup with   the Django REST Framework and Vue.js. Here, we cover advantages and disadvantages  of a pseudo-decoupled configuration, as we did in the previous section for the REST-less  setup.     Authentication and cookies: Session-based authentication is the   default choice for a pseudo-decoupled project, even with REST. Since  we serve the single-page application from within the same Django  project, it’s only a matter of authenticating the user through a regular  Django view and grabbing the appropriate cookies before making  POST requests from JavaScript.     Forms: If we decide to build one or more Django applications as   single-page applications, we lose the ability to use Django Forms and  Model Forms. This begins to lead to code duplication and more work  for the team, as good ’ol Django forms and their data validation layers  must be reimplemented with the JavaScript library of choice.     What JS library? In a pseudo-decoupled setup with REST, we can use  any JavaScript library or framework. This requires some extra steps to  include the bundle in the Django static system, but it is possible with  any library.  46   Chapter 4    advantages and disadvantages of deCoupled arChiteCtures       Routing: Routing for single-page apps served from within a Django  project is not trivial to implement. Django can still serve the main  path for each single app, something like https:  decoupled-  django.com billing  for example, but then each app must handle  its internal routing. Hash-based routing is the simplest form of  routing, and the easiest to implement, compared to history-based  routing.     Search engine optimization: Single-page applications  SPAs  are ill-  suited for content-heavy websites. This is one of the most important  aspects to take into account before integrating an SPA into Django.     Developer productivity burden: Any modern JavaScript library comes   with its own set of challenges and tooling. In a pseudo-decoupled  setup with REST and one or more single-page apps, the overhead for  Python developers can increase exponentially.     Testing: In a pseudo-decoupled setup with a low amount of JavaScript   ,it could make sense to use tools like Selenium or Splinter, taking  into account the need to implement automatic waiting for JavaScript  interactions. Instead, in a pseudo-decoupled configuration based on  REST and a SPA, Python-centric tools fall short. To test JavaScript-  heavy interfaces and JavaScript UI components such as those  implemented with Vue.js or React, tools like Cypress for functional  testing and Jest for unit testing are better choices.   Fully-Decoupled Django Opposed to a pseudo-decoupled setup, a fully-decoupled architecture, also called  headless, is an approach in which the frontend and the backend are completely  separated.  On the frontend we can find JavaScript single-page applications living on a different   domain origin from the backend, which now serves as a source of data with REST or  GraphQL. In the next two sections, we go over both approaches.  47    advantages and disadvantages of deCoupled arChiteCtures    Chapter 4   Fully-Decoupled with REST Fully-decoupled Django projects with REST are by far one of the most widespread  setups. Thanks to its high flexibility, the REST API and the frontend may be deployed  on different domains or origins. The Django REST Framework is the de-facto library for  building REST APIs in Django, while JavaScript leads the frontend with React, Vue.js, and  Angular. In these configurations, the architecture is usually arranged as follows:     The frontend of one or more Django apps lives outside Django as a   single-page JavaScript app     One or more Django apps expose a REST API  A Django project configured fully-decoupled with a REST API can serve wonderfully as:     A REST API for a SPA, a mobile app, or a Progressive Web App     A content repository for a static site generation tool  SSG  or for a   server-side rendered JavaScript project  SSR   Figure 4-3 shows a representation of fully-decoupled Django project with REST.  REQUEST  SPA  RESPONSE  REQUEST  RESPONSE  MOBILE APP  DJANGO  DJANGO APP  DRF REST API  DJANGO APP  DRF REST API  Figure 4-3.  A fully-decoupled Django project with REST can have one or more  apps, each with its own REST API. JavaScript lives outside the Django project as a  single-page application and talks to Django REST views through JSON  48   Chapter 4    advantages and disadvantages of deCoupled arChiteCtures    It’s important to note that not every Django app inside a project must expose a REST  API: one could choose to decouple one or more facets of the application, while keeping  the rest under the classic MVT arrangement. The separation of concerns prescribed by  REST opens the road to flexible, but also more complex, setups. What can we expect if  we decouple a Django project with REST?     Authentication and cookies: Authentication for fully-decoupled projects  is not trivial to implement. Session-based authentication can work with  REST and single-page apps, but it breaks the stateless constraint. There  are a number of different approaches to circumvent the limitations  of session-based authentication for REST APIs, but in later years the  community seemed oriented to embrace stateless authentication  mechanisms, such as token-based authentication with JWT  JSON web  tokens . However, JWT is not so welcomed in the Django community  due to its security flaws and potential implementation pitfalls.     Forms: Leaving Django templates and Forms means we lose the   ability to build forms easily. In a fully-decoupled setup, the form layer  is usually built entirely with JavaScript. Data validation often gets  duplicated in the frontend, which now has to sanitize and validate  the user input before sending requests to the backend.     What JS library? In a fully-decoupled setup with REST, we can   use any JavaScript library or framework. There isn’t any particular  constraint for pairing the Django REST backend with a decoupled  frontend.     Routing: In a fully-decoupled setup, Django does not handle routing  anymore. Everything weighs on the client’s shoulder. For single-page  applications, one can choose to implement hash-based or history  routing.     Search engine optimization: Single-page applications don’t play   well with SEO. However, with the emergence of JavaScript static-site  generators such as Gatsby, Next.js, and Nuxt.js, JavaScript developers  can use the latest shiny tools to generate static pages from a headless  Django project without the risk of harming SEO.  49   Chapter 4    advantages and disadvantages of deCoupled arChiteCtures       Developer productivity burden: In a fully-decoupled setup with REST   and one or more single-page apps, the work for Python developers  increases by orders of magnitudes. For this reason, most Django  and Python web agencies have a dedicated frontend team that deals  exclusively with JavaScript and its related tooling.     Testing: In a fully-decoupled project, the frontend and the backend  are tested separately. APITestCase and APISimpleTestCase help in  testing Django REST APIs, while on the frontend we see again Jest  and Cypress for testing the UI.   Fully-Decoupled with GraphQL As with fully-decoupled Django with REST, a fully-decoupled Django project with  GraphQL offers high flexibility, but also more technical challenges.  REST is a battle-tested technology. GraphQL on the other hand is pretty recent,  but seems to offer some apparent advantages over REST. However, as with any new  technology, developers and CTOs must assess carefully advantages and drawbacks  before integrating new tools, and potentially new challenges, in production projects.  Figure 4-4 shows a Django project decoupled with a GraphQL and a REST API.  REQUEST  SPA  RESPONSE  REQUEST  RESPONSE  MOBILE APP  DJANGO  DJANGO APP  GrapqhQL API  DJANGO APP  DRF REST API  Figure 4-4.  A fully-decoupled Django project can expose REST and GraphQL  APIs. It’s not unusual to have both technologies in the same project  50   Chapter 4    advantages and disadvantages of deCoupled arChiteCtures    In Figure 4-4, we imagine a fully-decoupled Django project that exposes two different  apps: one with REST and another with GraphQL. In fact, GraphQL can coexist with REST  to enable progressive refactorings from a legacy REST API to a GraphQL endpoint. This  is useful for assessing GraphQL before switching from REST or for exposing a GraphQL  API for tools like Gatsby. What is the price to pay for embracing GraphQL? Let’s see.     Authentication and cookies: Authentication for GraphQL in   fully-decoupled setups is mostly handled with token-based  authentication. On the backend, GraphQL needs to implement mutations  for handling login, logout, registration, and all the related corner cases.     What JS library? In a fully-decoupled setup with GraphQL, we can use   any JavaScript library or framework. There isn’t any particular constraint  for pairing the Django GraphQL backend with a decoupled frontend.  GraphQL queries can be done even with Fetch or XMLHttpRequest.     Search engine optimization: GraphQL in the frontend is mostly used   with client-side libraries like React. This means we cannot ship   client- side generated pages as they are, or we would risk SEO damages.  Tools like Gatsby, Next.js, and Nuxt.js can operate in SSG  static site  generation  mode to generate static pages from a GraphQL API.     Developer productivity burden: GraphQL is a novel technology  and especially in the frontend there are literally a dozen ways to  implement the data fetching layer. GraphQL seems to speed up  developer productivity, but at the same time it introduces new things  to learn and new patterns to take into account.  Since GraphQL is a data fetching layer, considerations for forms, routing, and testing   do not differ from those of a decoupled REST project.   Summary In this chapter we outlined various approaches to decoupling a Django project:     Pseudo-decoupled with and without REST     Fully decoupled with REST or GraphQL  Hopefully, you are now ready to make an informed choice for your next Django project.   In the next chapter, we prepare our Django project before moving to JavaScript and Vue.js.  51   CHAPTER 5  Setting Up a Django Project  This chapter covers:     Setting up the Django project  In the following sections, we begin to lay down the structure of our Django project. This project will accompany us for the rest of the book. It will be expanded with a   REST API in Chapter 6, and later with a GraphQL API.   Setting Up the Project To start off, create a new folder for the project and move into it:  mkdir decoupled-dj && cd $_  Note  It is a good idea to keep the project under source control with Git. You are  encouraged to initialize a repo with git init as soon as you create the project  folder.  Once inside the folder, create a new Python virtual environment:  python3.9 -m venv venv  For the virtual environment you can use any Python version above 3; the higher the   version, the better. When the environment is ready, activate it:  source venv bin activate    Valentino Gagliardi 2021  V. Gagliardi, Decoupled Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-7144-5_5  53   Chapter 5    SettInG Up a DjanGo projeCt  To confirm that the virtual environment is active, look for  venv  in your command   prompt. If everything is in place, install Django:  pip install django  It is best to install a version of Django greater than 3.1, which has support   Note  for asynchronous views.  Next up, create your Django project:  django-admin startproject decoupled_dj .  A note on the project folder structure:  decoupled-dj is the repo root          decoupled_dj is the actual Django project     Django apps live in decoupled-dj  python manage.py startapp billing  The second app instead is a blog:  python manage.py startapp blog  When you are ready, create two Django apps. The first app is named billing:  A brief explanation of these apps. billing will be a Django application exposing  a REST API for creating client invoices. blog will expose a REST API first, and then a  GraphQL API. Now check that you have everything in place inside the project root. Run  ls -1, and you should see the following output:  blog billing decoupled_dj manage.py venv  custom Django user.  54  In the next section, we continue the project customization with the introduction of a    Chapter 5    SettInG Up a DjanGo projeCt   A Custom User Although not strictly required for our project, a custom Django user can save you in the  long run if you decide to put your project in production. Let’s create one. First off, create  a new app:  python manage.py startapp user  Open users models.py and create the custom user, as shown in Listing 5-1.  Listing 5-1.  A Custom Django User  from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser from django.db.models import CharField  class User AbstractUser :    name = CharField blank=True, max_length=100      def __str__ self :        return self.email  We keep the custom user lean and simple with just one additional field to allow   further customizations in the future. The next step would be adding AUTH_USER_MODEL to  our settings file, but before doing so we need to split our settings by environment.  Tip  In the book entitled Practical Django 2 and Channels 2 by Federico Marani   the section entitled “the User Model” in Chapter 4 , you’ll find another extensive  example of a custom user in Django.  55    SettInG Up a DjanGo projeCt  Chapter 5   Interlude: Choosing the Right Database This step has inherently nothing to do with our decoupled Django project, but using the  right database is one of the most important things you can do, in any web framework.  Throughout the book I will use Postgres as the database of choice. If you want to do the  same, here’s how to get Postgres on your machine:     Postgres.app for MacOS     Postgres under Docker      Install Postgres directly on your system through a package manager  If instead you want to use SQLite, look for instructions in the next section.   Splitting the Settings File Particularly useful when deploying in production, split settings are a way to partition  Django settings depending on the environment. In a typical project, you may have:     The base environment, common for all scenarios     The development environment, with settings for development     The test environment, with settings that apply only to testing     The staging environment     The production environment  The theory is that depending on the environment, Django loads its settings from a   .env file. This approach is known as the Twelve-Factor app, first popularized by Heroku  in 2011. There are many libraries for Twelve-Factor in Django. Some developers prefer  to use os.environ to avoid additional dependencies altogether. My favorite library is  django-environ. For our project we set up three environments: base, development, and  later production. Let’s install django-environ and psycopg2:  pip install django-environ pyscopg2-binary   psycopg2 is required only if you use Postgres.  Next up, we create a new Python   package named settings in decoupled_dj. Once the folder is in place, create another  file for the base environment in decoupled_dj settings base.py. In this file, we import   56   django-environ, and we place everything Django needs to run, regardless of the specific  environment. Among these settings are:  Chapter 5    SettInG Up a DjanGo projeCt                      SECRET_KEY  DEBUG  INSTALLED_APPS  MIDDLEWARE  AUTH_USER_MODEL  Remember that in the previous section we configured a custom Django user. In the   base settings we need to include the custom user app in INSTALLED_APPS, and most  important, configure AUTH_USER_MODEL. Our base settings file should look like Listing 5-2.  Listing 5-2.  Base Settings for Our Project  import environ from pathlib import Path  BASE_DIR = Path __file__ .resolve  .parent.parent env = environ.Env   environ.Env.read_env   SECRET_KEY = env "SECRET_KEY"  DEBUG = env.bool "DEBUG", False   INSTALLED_APPS = [    "django.contrib.admin",    "django.contrib.auth",    "django.contrib.contenttypes",    "django.contrib.sessions",    "django.contrib.messages",    "django.contrib.staticfiles",    "users.apps.UsersConfig", ] MIDDLEWARE = [  OMITTED FOR BREVITY ] ROOT_URLCONF = "decoupled_dj.urls" TEMPLATES = [  OMITTED FOR BREVITY ] WSGI_APPLICATION = "decoupled_dj.wsgi.application  57   Chapter 5    SettInG Up a DjanGo projeCt  DATABASES = {"default": env.db   AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [   OMITTED FOR BREVITY  ] LANGUAGE_CODE = "en-GB" TIME_ZONE = "UTC" USE_I18N = True USE_L10N = True USE_TZ = Tru STATIC_URL = env "STATIC_URL"  AUTH_USER_MODEL = "users.User"  I have omitted for brevity the complete code for the following configurations:   Note  MIDDLEWARE, TEMPLATES, and AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS. these should  have the default values that come from stock Django.  Next up we create an .env file in the decoupled_dj settings folder. This file will   have different values depending on the environment. For development we use the values  in Listing 5-3.  Listing 5-3.  Environment File for Development  DEBUG=yes SECRET_KEY=!changethis! DATABASE_URL=psql:  decoupleddjango:localpassword@127.0.0.1 decoupleddjango STATIC_URL= static   If you want to use SQLite in place of Postgres, change DATABASE_URL to:  DATABASE_URL=sqlite: decoupleddjango.sqlite3  To complete the setup, create a new file called decoupled_dj settings   development.py and import everything from the base settings. In addition, we also  customize the configuration. Here we are going to enable django-extensions, a handy  library for Django in development  Listing 5-4 .  58   Chapter 5    SettInG Up a DjanGo projeCt  Listing 5-4.  decoupled_dj settings development.py – The Settings File for  Development  from .base import *   noqa INSTALLED_APPS = INSTALLED_APPS + ["django_extensions"]  Let’s also install the library:  pip install django-extensions  Let’s not forget to export the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable:  export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=decoupled_dj.settings.development  Now you can make the migrations:  python manage.py makemigrations  Finally, you can apply them to the database:  python manage.py migrate  In a moment, we will test our setup.   Bonus: Running Django Under ASGI To run Django asynchronously, we need an ASGI server. In production, you can use  Uvicorn with Gunicorn. In development, you might want to use Uvicorn standalone.  Install it:  pip install uvicorn  you haven’t already done so:  Again, don’t forget to export the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable if   export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=decoupled_dj.settings.development  Next up, run the server with the following command:  uvicorn decoupled_dj.asgi:application  If everything goes well, you should see the following output:  INFO: Uvicorn running on http:  127.0.0.1:8000  Press CTRL+C to quit   59   Chapter 5    SettInG Up a DjanGo projeCt  If you click on the link, you should see the familiar Django rocket! One more thing   before moving forward: we need to split the requirements file.   Splitting the Requirements File As we have done with the settings file, it is good practice to split the requirements for our  Django applications. We will work in development for most of the next chapters, and for  now we can split the requirements in two files: base and development. Later, we will also  add dependencies for testing and production. Create a new folder called requirements,  and place the base.txt and development.txt files into it. In the base file, we place the  most essential dependencies for our project:     Django          django-environ for working with .env files  pyscopg2-binary for connecting to Postgres  not required if you  decided to use SQLite      Uvicorn for running Django under ASGI  Your requirements base.txt file should look like the following:  Django==3.1.3 django-environ==0.4.5 psycopg2-binary==2.8.6 uvicorn==0.12.2  -r . base.txt django-extensions==3.0.9  Your requirements development.txt file instead should look like the following:  Note  Your versions of these packages will most likely be different from mine by  the time you read this book.  From now on, to install the dependencies of your project, you will run the following   command, where the requirements file will vary depending on the environment you are in:  pip install -r requirements development.txt  60   Chapter 5    SettInG Up a DjanGo projeCt  Note  It is a good moment to commit the changes you made so far and to  push the work to your Git repo. You can find the source code for this chapter  at https:  github.com valentinogagliardi decoupled- dj tree  chapter_05_setting_up_project.   Summary This chapter prepared the Django project and explained how to run a Django with an  asynchronous ASGI server. You learned:     How to split settings and requirements     How to run Django under Uvicorn  In the next chapter, we finally get hands on with Django and JavaScript frontends.  61   CHAPTER 6  Decoupled Django  with the Django REST  Framework  This chapter covers:     The Django REST Framework with Vue.js     Single-page applications in Django templates     Nested DRF serializers  In this chapter, you learn how to use the Django REST Framework to expose a REST   API in your Django project, and how to serve a single-page application within Django.   Building the Billing App In the previous chapter, we created a billing app in the Django project. If you haven’t  done this yet, here’s a quick recap. First off, configure DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE:  export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=decoupled_dj.settings.development  Then, run the startapp command to create the app:  python manage.py startapp billing  If you prefer more flexibility but also more typing, you can pass the settings file   directly to manage.py:  python manage.py command_name --settings=decoupled_dj.settings.development    Valentino Gagliardi 2021  V. Gagliardi, Decoupled Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-7144-5_6  63   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework  Here, command_name is the name of the command you want to run. You can also   make a shell function out of this command to avoid typing it again and again.  Note  The rest of this chapter assumes you are in the repo root decoupled-dj,  with the Python virtual environment active.   Building the Models For this app we need a couple of Django models: Invoice for the actual invoice, and  ItemLine, which represents a single row in the invoice. Let’s outline the relationships  between these models:     Each Invoice can have one or many ItemLines     An ItemLine belongs to exactly one Invoice  This is a many-to-one  or one-to-many  relationship, which means that ItemLine  will have a foreign key to Invoice  if you need a refresher on this topic, check out the  resources section at the end of the chapter . In addition, each Invoice is associated with  a User  the custom Django user we built in Chapter 3 . This means:     A User can have many Invoices     Each Invoice belongs to one User  To help make sense of this, Figure 6-1 shows the ER diagram on which we will build   these Django models.  64   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework  User BIGINT VARCHAR 100  VARCHAR 254   PK  id name email  Other Django User fields omitted for brevity.  Invoice  PK FK,U  id user date due_date state  BIGINT BIGINT DATE DATE VARCHAR 15   ItemLine  PK FK,U  id invoice quantity description price taxed  BIGINT BIGINT INTEGER VARCHAR 500  DECIMAL 8  BOOLEAN  Figure 6-1.  The ER diagram for the billing application  Having defined the entities, let’s now build the appropriate Django models. Open   billing models.py and define the models as shown in Listing 6-1.  Listing 6-1.  billing models.py – The Models for the Billing App  from django.db import models from django.conf import settings  class Invoice models.Model :    class State models.TextChoices :        PAID = "PAID"        UNPAID = "UNPAID"        CANCELLED = "CANCELLED"  PROTECT      date = models.DateField      due_date = models.DateField        user = models.ForeignKey to=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.  65   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework      state = models.CharField max_length=15, choices=State.choices,   default=State.UNPAID   class ItemLine models.Model :    invoice = models.ForeignKey to=Invoice, on_delete=models.PROTECT     quantity = models.IntegerField      description = models.CharField max_length=500     price = models.DecimalField max_digits=8, decimal_places=2     taxed = models.BooleanField    Here we take advantage of models.TextChoices, a feature shipped with Django 3.0.   As for the rest, they are standard Django fields, with all the relationships set up according  to the ER diagram. To add a bit more protection, since we don’t want to delete the  invoices or the item lines by accident, we use PROTECT on them.   Enabling the App When the models are ready, enable the billing app in decoupled_dj settings base.py,  as shown in Listing 6-2.  Listing 6-2.  decoupled_dj settings base.py - Enabling the Billing App  INSTALLED_APPS = [    ...    "billing.apps.BillingConfig", ]  python manage.py makemigrations python manage.py migrate  Finally, you can make and apply the migrations  these are two separate commands :  With the app in place, we are now ready to outline the interface, and later the   backend code to make it work.   Wireframing the Billing App Before talking about any frontend library, let’s first see what we are going to build. Figure 6-2  shows a wireframe of the billing app, specifically, the interface for creating a new invoice.  66   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework  Figure 6-2.  The wireframe for the billing app  Having the UI in mind before writing any code is important; this is an approach  known as outside-in development. By looking at the interface, we can begin to think  about what API endpoint we need to expose. What HTTP calls should we make from the  frontend to the backend? First off, we need to fetch a list of clients to populate the select  that says “Select a client”. This is a GET call to an endpoint like  billing api clients .  As for the rest, it’s almost all dynamic data that must be sent with a POST request once we  compile all the fields in the invoice. This could be a request to  billing api invoices .  There is also a Send Email button, which should trigger an email. To summarize, we  need to make the following calls:              GET all or a subset of users from  billing api clients   POST data for a new invoice to  billing api invoices   POST for sending an email to the client  you will work on this in  Chapter 11   These interactions might sound trivial to any developer familiar with JavaScript.   Nevertheless, they will help make sense of the architecture of a typical decoupled  project. In the next sections, we pair a JavaScript frontend with a DRF API. Keep in mind   67   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework  that we focus on the interactions and on the architecture between all the moving parts  rather than strive for the perfect code implementation.  Note  we don’t have a specialized client model in this project. a client is just a  user for Django. we use the term client on the frontend for convenience, while for  Django everyone is a User.   Pseudo-Decoupled with the Django REST Framework We talked about pseudo-decoupled in the previous chapter, as a way to augment the  application frontend with JavaScript or to replace the static frontend altogether with a  single-page app.  We haven’t touched authentication extensively yet, but in brief, one of the advantages   of a pseudo-decoupled approach is that we can use the fantastic built-in Django  authentication, based on sessions. In the following sections, we work in practice with one of  the most popular JavaScript libraries for building interactive frontends—Vue.js—to see how  it fits into Django. Vue.js is a perfect match for a pseudo-decoupled Django project, thanks  to its high configurability. If you are wondering, we will cover React later in the book.   Vue.js and Django Let’s start off with Vue. We want to serve our single-page application from within a  Django template.  To do so, we must set up a Vue project. First off, install Vue CLI:  npm install -g @vue cli  Now we need to create the Vue project somewhere. Vue is highly configurable; in  most cases it’s up to you to decide where to put the app. To keep things consistent we  create the Vue app inside the billing folder, where our Django app already lives. Move  inside the folder and run Vue CLI:  cd billing vue create vue_spa  68   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework  The installer will ask whether we want to manually select the features or use the   default preset. For our project, we pick the following configurations:     Vue 2.x     Babel     No routing     Linter formatter  ESLint and Prettier      Configuration in dedicated config files  Press Enter and let the installer configure the project. When the package manager   finishes pulling in all the dependencies, take a minute to explore the Vue project  structure. Once you’re done, you are ready to explore all the steps for making the single-  page app work within Django.  To keep things manageable, we target only the development environment for now    we cover production in the next chapter . As anticipated in Chapter 2, Django can serve  static files in development with the integrated server. When we run python manage. py runserver, Django collects all the static assets, as long as we configure STATIC_URL.  In Chapter 3, we split all the settings for our project, and we configured STATIC_URL as   static  for development. Out of the box, Django can collect static files from each app  folder, and for our billing app, this means we need to put static assets in billing static.  With a bunch of simple JavaScript files this is easy. You simply place them in   the appropriate folder. With a CLI tool like Vue CLI or create-react-app instead, the  destination folder for the JavaScript bundle and for all other static assets is already  decided for you by the tool. For Vue CLI, this folder is named dist, and it is meant to  end up in the same project folder of your single-page app. This is bad for Django, which  won’t be able to pick up these static files. Luckily, thanks to Vue’s configurability, we can  put our JavaScript build and the template where Django expects them. We can decide  where static files and index.html should end up through vue.config.js. Since Vue CLI  has an integrated development server with hot reloading, we have two options at this  point in development:     We serve the app with npm run serve     We serve the app through Django’s development server  With the first option, we can run and access the app at http:  localhost:8081  to  see changes in real time. With the second option, is convenient to get a more real-world   69   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework  feeling: for example we can use the built-in authentication system. In order to go with  the second option, we need to configure Vue CLI.  To start off, in the Vue project folder billing vue_spa, create an environment file   named .env.staging with the following content:  VUE_APP_STATIC_URL= static billing   Note that this is the combination between Django’s STATIC_URL, which we aptly   configured in decoupled_dj settings .env, and Django’s app folder called billing.  Next up, create vue.config.js in the same Vue project folder, with the content shown in  Listing 6-3.  Listing 6-3.  billing vue_spa vue.config.js – Vue’s Custom Configuration  const path = require "path" ;  module.exports = {  publicPath: process.env.VUE_APP_STATIC_URL,  outputDir: path.resolve __dirname, ".. static", "billing" ,   indexPath: path.resolve __dirname, ".. templates ", "billing",   "index.html"  };  With this configuration, we tell Vue to:     Use the path specified at .env.staging as the publicPath     Put static assets to outputDir inside billing static billing     Put the index.html to indexPath inside billing templates   billing  This setup respects Django expectations about where to find static files and the main   template. publicPath is the path at which the Vue app is expecting to be deployed. In  development staging, we can point to  static billing , where Django will serve the  files. In production, we provide a different path.  70   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework  Note  Django is highly configurable in regard to static files and template  structure. You are free to experiment with alternative setups. Throughout the book  we will adhere to the stock Django structure.  Now you can build your Vue project in “staging” mode  you should run this   command from the Vue project folder :  npm run build -- --mode staging  After running the build, you should see Vue files landing in the expected folders:     Static assets go in billing static billing      index.html goes in billing templates billing  To test things out, we need to wire up a view and the URLs in Django. First off, in  billing views.py create a subclass of TemplateView to serve Vue’s index.html, as  shown in Listing 6-4.  Listing 6-4.  billing views.py - Template View for Serving the App Entry Point  from django.views.generic import TemplateView  class Index TemplateView :       template_name = "billing index.html"  if you like function view more, you can use the render   shortcut with a   Note  function view instead of a TemplateView.  Next up, configure the main route in billing urls.py, as shown in Listing 6-5.  Listing 6-5.  billing urls.py - URL Configuration  from django.urls import path from .views import Index  app_name = "billing"  71   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework  urlpatterns = [       path "", Index.as_view  , name="index"  ]  Finally, include the URL for the billing app in decoupled_dj urls.py, as shown in   Listing 6-6.  Listing 6-6.  decoupled_dj urls.py - Project URL Configuration  from django.urls import path, include  urlpatterns = [    path         "billing ",        include "billing.urls", namespace="billing"      , ]  You can now run Django development server in another terminal:  python manage.py runserver  running, as shown in Figure 6-3.  If you visit http:  127.0.0.1:8000 billing , you should see your Vue app up and   72   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework  Figure 6-3.  Our Vue app is served by Django’s development server  You may wonder why we use the term staging, and not development, for this setup.  What you get out of this configuration, really, is more like a “pre-staging” environment  where you can test the Vue app within Django. The drawback of this configuration is that  to see changes reflected, we need to rebuild the Vue app every time. Of course nothing  stops you from running npm run serve to start the Vue app with the integrated webpack  server. In the next sections, we complete the UI for our billing app, and finally the REST  backend.   Building the Vue App Let’s now build our Vue app. To start off, wipe the boilerplate from vue_spa src App. vue and start with the code shown in Listing 6-7.  73   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework  Listing 6-7.  Main Vue Component    import InvoiceCreate from "@ components InvoiceCreate";                       export default {   name: "App",   components: {       InvoiceCreate   } };    Here we include the InvoiceCreate component. Now, create this component in a  new file called vue_spa src components InvoiceCreate.vue,  you can also remove  HelloWorld.vue . Listing 6-8 shows the template part first.  Listing 6-8.

JavaScript Section of the Vue Form Component     A checkbox for taxed     Two buttons  Listing 6-9.    export default {  name: "InvoiceCreate",  data: function   {    return {  76   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework       users: [        { id: 1, name: "xadrg", email: "xadrg@acme.io" },        { id: 2, name: "olcmf", email: "olcmf@zyx.dev" }      ]    };  },  methods: {    handleSubmit: function event  {         eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars      const formData = new FormData event.target ;          TODO - build the request body      const data = {};       fetch " billing api invoices ", {        method: "POST",        headers: { "Content-Type": "application json" },        body: JSON.stringify data       }         .then response => {          if  !response.ok  throw Error response.statusText ;          return response.json  ;        }         .then json => {          console.log json ;        }         .catch err => console.log err  ;    }  },  mounted   {    fetch " billing api clients "       .then response => {        if  !response.ok  throw Error response.statusText ;        return response.json  ;      }       .then json => {  77   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework         this.users = json;      } ;  } };    In this code we have:     A users property inside the Vue component state     A method for handling the form submit     A mounted lifecycle method for fetching data on mount  Also, we target our API endpoints  not yet implemented :  billing api clients    and  billing api invoices . You can notice some fake data in users; this is so we have  a minimal usable interface while we wait for building the REST API.  Tip  You can develop the frontend without a backend, with tools like mirage jS,  which can intercept and respond to hTTP calls.  To make the code work, remember to put the template and the script part in order in  vue_spa src components InvoiceCreate.vue. With this minimal implementation, you  are now ready to start the project in two ways. To build the app and serve it with Django,  run the following in the Vue project folder:  npm run build -- --mode staging  Then, start the Django development server and head over to http:    localhost:8000 billing . To run Vue with its development server instead, run the  following inside the Vue folder:  The app will start at http:  localhost:8081 , but since we don’t have the backend  yet, nothing will work for the end user. In the meantime, we can set up the application so  that:     When launched under Django’s umbrella, it calls  billing api   clients  and  billing api invoices   npm run serve  78   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework     When called with the integrated webpack server, it calls   http:  localhost:8000 billing api clients  and http:   localhost:8000 billing api invoices , which are the endpoints  where the DRF will listen  To do this, open vue.config.js and add the lines in Listing 6-10 in the   configuration.  Listing 6-10.  Development Server Configuration for Vue CLI     omitted module.exports = {      omitted   devServer: {       proxy: "http:  localhost:8000"   } };  This ensures the project works well in staging production with a pseudo-decoupled   setup, and in development as a standalone app. In a minute, we will finally build the  REST backend.   Vue.js, Django, and CSS At this point you may wonder where CSS fits into the big picture. Our Vue component  does have some classes, but we didn’t show any CSS pipeline in the previous section.  The reason is that there are at least two approaches for working with CSS in a project   like the one we are building. Specifically, you can:          Include CSS in a base Django template  Include CSS from each single-page app  At the time of this writing, Tailwind is one of the most popular CSS libraries on the   Django scene. In a pseudo-decoupled setup, you can configure Tailwind in the main  Django project, include the CSS bundle in a base template, and have a single-page Vue  app extend the base template. If each single-page app is independent, each one with  its own style, you can configure Tailwind and friends individually. Be aware that the  maintainability of the second approach might be a bit difficult in the long run.  79   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework  Note  You can find a minimal CSS implementation for the component in the  source code for this chapter at https:  github.com valentinogagliardi  decoupled- dj tree chapter_06_decoupled_with_drf.   Building the REST Backend We left a note in our Vue component that says    TODO - build the request body.  This is because with the form we built, we cannot send the request as it is to the Django  REST Framework. You’ll see the reason in a moment. In the meantime, with the UI in  place, we can wire up the backend with the DRF. Based on the endpoints we call from the  UI, we need to expose the following sources:           billing api clients    billing api invoices   Let’s also recap the relationships between all the entities:     Each Invoice can have one or many ItemLines     An ItemLine belongs to exactly one Invoice     A User can have many Invoices     Each Invoice belongs to one User  What does this mean? When POSTing to the backend to create a new invoice, Django      The user ID to associate the invoice with     One or more item lines to associate the invoice with  The user is not a problem because we grab it from the first API call to  billing   api clients . Each item and the associated invoice cannot be sent as a whole from the  frontend. We need to:     Build the correct object in the frontend     Adjust the ORM logic in the DRF to save related objects  wants:  80   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework   Building the Serializers To start off, we need to create the following components in the DRF:     A serializer for User     A serializer for Invoice     A serializer for ItemLine  As a first step let’s install the Django REST Framework:  pip install djangorestframework  Once it’s installed, update requirements base.txt to include the DRF:  Next up, enable the DRF in decoupled_dj settings base.py, as shown in    Listing 6-11.  decoupled_dj settings base.py - Django Installed Apps with the  DRF Enabled  Django==3.1.3 django-environ==0.4.5 psycopg2-binary==2.8.6 uvicorn==0.12.2 djangorestframework==3.12.2  Listing 6-11.  INSTALLED_APPS = [    ...    "users.apps.UsersConfig",    "billing.apps.BillingConfig",    "rest_framework",  enables DRF ]  Now create a new Python package named api in billing so that we have a billing   api folder. In this package, we place all the logic for our REST API. Let’s now build the  serializers. Create a new file called billing api serializers.py with the content  shown in Listing 6-12.  81   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework  Listing 6-12.  billing api serializers.py – The DRF Serializers  from users.models import User from billing.models import Invoice, ItemLine from rest_framework import serializers  class UserSerializer serializers.ModelSerializer :    class Meta:        model = User        fields = ["id", "name", "email"]  class ItemLineSerializer serializers.ModelSerializer :    class Meta:        model = ItemLine        fields = ["quantity", "description", "price", "taxed"]  class InvoiceSerializer serializers.ModelSerializer :    items = ItemLineSerializer many=True, read_only=True      class Meta:        model = Invoice        fields = ["user", "date", "due_date", "items"]  Here we have three serializers. UserSerializer will serialize our User model.   ItemLineSerializer is the serializer for an ItemLine. Finally, InvoiceSerializer will  serialize our Invoice model. Each serializer subclasses the DRF’s ModelSerializer,  which we encountered in Chapter 3, and has the appropriate fields mapping to the  corresponding model. The last serializer in the list, InvoiceSerializer, is interesting  because it contains a nested ItemLineSerializer. It’s this serializer that needs some  work to comply with our frontend. To see why, let’s build the views.   Building the Views and the URL Create a new file called billing api views.py with the code shown in Listing 6-13.  Listing 6-13.  billing api views.py - DRF Views  from .serializers import InvoiceSerializer, UserSerializer, User from rest_framework.generics import CreateAPIView, ListAPIView  82   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework  class ClientList ListAPIView :    serializer_class = UserSerializer    queryset = User.objects.all    class InvoiceCreate CreateAPIView :    serializer_class = InvoiceSerializer  These views will respond respectively to  billing api clients  and  billing   api invoices . Here, ClientList is a subclass of the generic DRF list view.  InvoiceCreate instead subclasses the DRF’s generic create view. We are now ready to  wire up the URLs for our app. Open billing urls.py and define your routes as shown  in Listing 6-14.  Listing 6-14.  billing urls.py - URL Patterns for the Billing API  from django.urls import path from .views import Index from .api.views import ClientList, InvoiceCreate  app_name = "billing"  urlpatterns = [    path "", Index.as_view  , name="index" ,    path         "api clients ",        ClientList.as_view  ,        name="client-list" ,    path         "api invoices ",        InvoiceCreate.as_view  ,        name="invoice-create" , ]  Here, app_name paired with a namespace in the main project URL will allow us to   call billing:client-list and billing:invoice-create with reverse  , which is  particularly useful in testing. As a last step, you should have the URLs configured in  decoupled_dj urls.py, as shown in Listing 6-15.  83   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework  Listing 6-15.  decoupled_dj urls.py - The Main Project URL Configuration  from django.urls import path, include  urlpatterns = [    path         "billing ",        include "billing.urls", namespace="billing"      , ]  We are ready to test things out. To create a couple of models in the database, you can   launch an enhanced shell  this comes from django-extensions :  python manage.py shell_plus  To create the models, run the following queries  >>> is the shell prompt :  >>> User.objects.create_user username="jul81", name="Juliana",  email="juliana@acme.io"  >>> User.objects.create_user username="john89", name="John", email="john@ zyx.dev"   Exit the shell and start Django:  python manage.py runserver  In another terminal, run the following curl command and see what happens:  curl -X POST --location "http:  127.0.0.1:8000 billing api invoices " \    -H "Accept: * *" \    -H "Content-Type: application json" \    -d "{          \"user\": 1,          \"date\": \"2020-12-01\",          \"due_date\": \"2020-12-30\"        }"  As a response you should see the following output:  {"user":1,"date":"2020-12-01","due_date":"2020-12-30"}  84   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework  This is the Django REST Framework telling us it created a new invoice in the   database. So far so good. How about adding some items to the invoice now? To do so, we  need to make the serializer writable. In billing api serializers.py, remove read_ only=True from the field items so that it looks like Listing 6-16.  Listing 6-16.  billing api serializers.py - The Serializer for an Invoice, Now with a  Writable Relationship  class InvoiceSerializer serializers.ModelSerializer :    items = ItemLineSerializer many=True      class Meta:        model = Invoice        fields = ["user", "date", "due_date", "items"]  You can test again with curl, this time by passing also two items:  curl -X POST --location "http:  127.0.0.1:8000 billing api invoices " \    -H "Accept: application json" \    -H "Content-Type: application json" \    -d "{          \"user\": 1,          \"date\": \"2020-12-01\",          \"due_date\": \"2020-12-30\",          \"items\": [            {              \"quantity\": 2,              \"description\": \"JS consulting\",              \"price\": 9800.00,              \"taxed\": false            },            {              \"quantity\": 1,              \"description\": \"Backend consulting\",              \"price\": 12000.00,              \"taxed\": true            }          ]        }"  85   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework  At this point everything should blow up, and you should see the following exception:  TypeError: Invoice   got an unexpected keyword argument 'items' Exception Value: Got a TypeError when calling Invoice.objects.create  .  This may be because you have a writable field on the serializer class that is not a valid   argument to Invoice.objects.create  . You may need to make the field read-only or  override the InvoiceSerializer.create   method to handle this correctly.  Django REST is asking us to tweak create   in InvoiceSerializer so it can accept   items alongside with the invoice.   Working with Nested Serializers Open billing api serializers.py and modify the serializer as shown in Listing 6-17.  Listing 6-17.  billing api serializers.py - The Serializer for an Invoice, Now with a  Customized create    class InvoiceSerializer serializers.ModelSerializer :    items = ItemLineSerializer many=True      class Meta:        model = Invoice        fields = ["user", "date", "due_date", "items"]     def create self, validated_data :        items = validated_data.pop "items"         invoice = Invoice.objects.create **validated_data         for item in items:            ItemLine.objects.create invoice=invoice, **item         return invoice  This is also a good moment to tweak the ItemLine model. As you can see from   the serializer, we are using the items field to set related items on a given invoice. The  problem is, there is no such field available in the Invoice model. This is because reverse  relationships on a Django model are accessible as modelname_set unless configured  differently. To fix the field, open billing models.py and add the related_name attribute  to the invoice row, as shown in Listing 6-18.  86   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework  Listing 6-18.  billing models.py - The ItemLine Model with a related_name  class ItemLine models.Model :    invoice = models.ForeignKey       to=Invoice, on_delete=models.PROTECT, related_name="items"         ...  After saving the file, run the migration as follows:  python manage.py makemigrations billing python manage.py migrate  After starting Django, you should now be able to repeat the same curl request, this   time with success. At this stage, we can fix the frontend as well.   Fixing the Vue Frontend In vue_spa src components InvoiceCreate.vue, locate the line that says      TODO - build the request body and adjust the code as shown in Listing 6-19.  Listing 6-19.  The handleSubmit Method from the Vue Component   methods: {    handleSubmit: function event  {      const formData = new FormData event.target ;       const data = Object.fromEntries formData ;      data.items = [        {          quantity: formData.get "quantity" ,          description: formData.get "description" ,          price: formData.get "price" ,          taxed: Boolean formData.get "taxed"          }      ];  87   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework       fetch " billing api invoices ", {        method: "POST",        headers: { "Content-Type": "application json" },        body: JSON.stringify data       }            omitted;    }  }  For brevity, I show only the relevant portion. Here, we use Object.fromEntries     ECMAScript 2019  to build an object from our form. We then proceed to add an array  of items  it has just one item for now  to the object. We finally send the object as the  body payload for fetch. You can run Vue with the integrated server  from within the Vue  project folder :  npm run serve  You should see a form that creates an invoice at http:  localhost:8080 . Try to   fill the form and click on Create Invoice. In the browser console, you should see the  response from the Django REST Framework, with the invoice being successfully saved  to the database. Great job! We finished the first real feature of this decoupled Django  project.  Note  it is a good moment to commit the changes you made so far and to  push the work to your git repo. You can find the source code for this chapter  at  https:  github.com valentinogagliardi decoupled- dj tree  chapter_06_decoupled_with_drf.  EXERCISE 6-1: HANDLING MULTIPLE ITEMS  extend the Vue component to handle multiple items for the invoice. The user should be able to  click on a plus  +  button to add more items to the form, which should be sent along with the  request.  88   ChaPTer 6    DeCouPleD Django wiTh The Django reST Framework   Summary This chapter paired up a Vue.js frontend with a Django REST Framework API, with Vue.js  served in the same context as the main Django project.  By doing so, you learned how to:  Integrate Vue.js into Django          Interact with a DRF API from JavaScript     Work with nested serializers in the Django REST Framework  In the next chapter, we approach a more real-world scenario. We discuss security  and deployment, before moving again to the JavaScript land, with Next.js in Chapter 8.   Additional Resource     Understanding many- to- one in Django  89   CHAPTER 7  API Security and  Deployment  This chapter covers:     Django hardening     REST API hardening     Deployment to production  Django REST Framework and Vue.js.  In the previous chapter, we assembled a pseudo-decoupled Django project with the   It’s now time to explore the security implications of such a setup, which are not so   dissimilar from running a monolith, but do require some extra steps due to the presence  of the REST API. After a focus on security, in the second part of the chapter we cover  deployment to production with Gunicorn and NGINX.  In the first part of this chapter, we assume you are in the repo    Note  root decoupled-dj, with the Python virtual environment active, and with  DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE configured as decoupled_dj.settings. development.   Django Hardening Django is one of the most secure web frameworks out there.  However, it’s easy to let things slip out, especially when we are in a hurry to see our   project up and running in production. Before exposing our website or our API to the  world, we need to take care of some extra details to avoid surprises. It’s important to keep     Valentino Gagliardi 2021  V. Gagliardi, Decoupled Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-7144-5_7  91   ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment  in mind that the suggestions provided in this chapter are far from exhaustive. Security is  a huge topic, not counting that each project and each team might have different needs  when it comes to security, due to regional regulations or governmental requirements.   Django Settings for Production In Chapter 5, in the “Splitting the Settings File” section, we configured our Django  project to use different settings for each environment.  As of now, we have the following settings:  decoupled_dj settings base.py  decoupled_dj settings development.py  To prepare the project for production, we create another settings file in decoupled_ dj settings production.py, which will hold all the production-related settings. What  should go in this file? Some of the most important settings for production in Django are:  SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT: Ensures that every request via HTTP gets  redirected to HTTPS  ALLOWED_HOSTS: Drives what hostnames Django will serve  STATIC_ROOT: Is where Django will look for static files  In addition to these settings, there are also DRF-related configurations, which we   touch on in the next sections. There are also a lot more authentication-related settings  that we cover in Chapter 10. To start off, create decoupled_dj settings production.py  and configure it as shown in Listing 7-1.  Listing 7-1.  decoupled_dj settings production.py – The First Settings for  Production                      from .base import *   noqa  SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True ALLOWED_HOSTS = env.list "ALLOWED_HOSTS"  STATIC_ROOT = env "STATIC_ROOT"   These settings will be read from an .env file, depending on the environment. In   development, we have the settings shown in Listing 7-2.  92   ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment  Listing 7-2.  The Development .env File  DEBUG=yes SECRET_KEY=!changethis! DATABASE_URL=psql:  decoupleddjango:localpassword@127.0.0.1 decoupleddjango STATIC_URL= static   Note  how does DEBUG work here if we pass yes instead of a Boolean? the  conversion is handled by django-environ for us.  In production, we need to tweak this file according to the requirements we describe   in decoupled_dj settings production.py. This means we must deploy the .env file  shown in Listing 7-3.  Listing 7-3.  decoupled_dj settings .env.production.example - The Production  .env File  ALLOWED_HOSTS=decoupled-django.com,static.decoupled-django.com DEBUG=no SECRET_KEY=!changethis! DATABASE_URL=psql:  decoupleddjango:localpassword@127.0.0.1 decoupleddjango STATIC_URL=https:  static.decoupled-django.com STATIC_ROOT=static   Note  the database settings shown here assume we are using Postgres as the  database for the project. to use SQlite instead, change the database configuration  to DATABASE_URL=sqlite: decoupleddjango.sqlite3.  It is of utmost importance in production to disable DEBUG to avoid error leaking. In the   previous file, note how the static related settings are slightly different from development:      STATIC_URL is now configured to read static assets from a static. decoupled-django.com subdomain      STATIC_ROOT in production will read files from the static folder  93   ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment  With this basic configuration for production, we can move to harden our Django   project a little bit more, with authentication.   Authentication and Cookies in Django In the previous chapter, we configured a Vue.js single-page app, served from a Django  view. Let’s review the code in billing views.py, which is summarized in Listing 7-4.  Listing 7-4.  billing views.py - A TemplateView Serves the Vue.js SPA  from django.views.generic import TemplateView  class Index TemplateView :    template_name = "billing index.html"  Locally, we can access the view at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 billing  after   running the Django development server, which is fine. However, once the project  goes live, nothing stops anonymous users from freely reaching the view and  making unauthenticated requests. To harden our project, we can, first of all, require  authentication on the view with the LoginRequiredMixin for class-based views. Open  billing views.py and change the view, as shown in Listing 7-5.  Listing 7-5.  billing views.py - Adding Authentication to the Billing View  from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin from django.views.generic import TemplateView  class Index LoginRequiredMixin, TemplateView :    template_name = "billing index.html"  From now on, any user who wants to access this view must authenticate. For us at this   stage, it’s enough to create a superuser in development with the following command:  python manage.py createsuperuser  Once this is done, we can authenticate through the admin view, and then visit   http:  127.0.0.1:8000 billing  to create new invoices. But as soon as we fill the  form and click on Create Invoice, Django will return an error. In the Network tab of the   94   ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment  browser’s console, after trying to submit the form, we should see the following error in  the response from the server:  "CSRF Failed: CSRF token missing or incorrect."  Django has a protection against CSRF attacks, and it won’t let us submit AJAX   requests without a valid CSRF token. In traditional Django forms, this token is usually  included as a template tag, and it’s sent to the backend by the browser as a cookie.  However, when the frontend is built entirely with JavaScript, the CSRF token must be  retrieved from the cookie storage and sent alongside the request as a header. To fix this  problem in our Vue.js app, we can use vue-cookies, a convenient library for handling  cookies. In a terminal, move to the Vue project folder called billing vue_spa and run  the following command:  npm i vue-cookies  Next up, load the library in billing vue_spa src main.js, as shown in Listing 7-6.  Listing 7-6.  billing vue_spa src main.js - Enabling Vue-Cookies  ... import VueCookies from "vue-cookies";  Vue.use VueCookies ; ...  Finally, in billing vue_spa src components InvoiceCreate.vue, grab the cookie   and include it as a header, as outlined in Listing 7-7.  Listing 7-7.  billing vue_spa src components InvoiceCreate.vue - Including the  CSRF Token in the AJAX Request  ...      const csrfToken = this.$cookies.get "csrftoken" ;       fetch " billing api invoices ", {        method: "POST",        headers: {          "Content-Type": "application json",          "X-CSRFToken": csrfToken        },  95   ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment         body: JSON.stringify data       }         .then response => {          if  !response.ok  throw Error response.statusText ;          return response.json  ;        }         .then json => {          console.log json ;        }         .catch err => console.log err  ; ...  To test things out, we can rebuild the Vue app with the following command:  npm run build -- --mode staging  After running Django, the creation of a new invoice at http:  127.0.0.1:8000   billing  should now work as expected.  Note  a popular alternative to Fetch, axios can help with an interceptor feature.  It’s convenient for attaching cookies or other headers globally, on each request.  Back to the authentication front. At this stage, we enabled the most straightforward  authentication method in Django: session-based authentication. This is one of the most  traditional and most robust authentication mechanisms in Django. It relies on sessions,  saved in the Django database. When the user logs in with credentials, Django stores a  session in the database and sends back two cookies to the user’s browser: csrftoken and  sessionid. When the user makes requests to the website, the browser sends back these  cookies, which Django validates against what has been stored in the database. Since  HTTPS encryption is a mandatory requirement for websites these days, it makes sense to  disable the transmission of csrftoken and sessionid over plain HTTP. To do so, we can  add two configuration directives in decoupled_dj settings production.py, as shown  in Listing 7-8.  96   Listing 7-8.  decoupled_dj settings production.py - Securing Authentication  Cookies  ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment  ... CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True ...  With CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE and SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE set to True, we ensure that   session authentication related cookies are transmitted only over HTTPS.   Randomize the Admin URL The built-in admin panel is probably one of the most beloved Django features. However,  the URL for this panel, which by default is admin , can be targeted by automated brute force  attacks when the website is exposed online. To mitigate the issue, we can introduce a bit  of randomness in the URL, by changing it to something not easily guessable. This change  needs to happen in the project root decoupled_dj urls.py, as shown in Listing 7-9.  Listing 7-9.  decoupled_dj urls.py - Hiding the Real Admin URL in Production  from django.urls import path, include from django.contrib import admin from django.conf import settings  urlpatterns = [    path "billing ", include "billing.urls", namespace="billing"  , ]  if settings.DEBUG:    urlpatterns = [        path "admin ", admin.site.urls ,    ] + urlpatterns  if not settings.DEBUG:    urlpatterns = [        path "77randomAdmin@33 ", admin.site.urls ,    ] + urlpatterns  97   ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment  This code tells Django to change the admin URL from admin  to 77randomAdmin@33    when DEBUG is False. With this little change, we add a bit more protection to the admin  panel. Let’s now see what we can do to improve the security of our REST API.   REST API Hardening What is better than a REST API? A secure REST API, of course.  In the following sections, we will cover a set of strategies for improving the security   posture of our REST API. To do so, we borrow some guidance from the REST Security  Cheat Sheet by the OWASP foundation.   HTTPS Encryption and HSTS HTTPS is a must for every website these days.  By configuring SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT in our Django project, we ensure that our   REST API is secured as well. When we cover deployment in the next sections, we will see  that in our setup, NGINX provides SSL termination for our Django project. In addition  to HTTPS, we can also configure Django to attach an HTTP header named Strict-  Transport- Security to the response. By doing so, we ensure that browsers will connect  to our websites only through HTTPS. This feature is called HSTS, and while Django has  HSTS-related settings, it is common practice to add these headers at the webserver  proxy level. The website https:  securityheaders.com offers a free scanner that can  help in identifying what security headers can be added to the NGINX configuration.   Audit Logging Audit logging refers to the practice of writing logs for each action carried in a system—be  it a web application, a REST API, or a database—as a way to record “who did what” at a  particular point in time.  Paired with a log aggregation system, audit logging is a great way to improve data   security. The OWASP REST Security Cheat Sheet prescribes audit logging for REST APIs.  Out of the box, Django already provides some minimal form of audit logging in the  admin. Also, the user table in Django records the last login of each user in the system.  But these two trails are far from being a full-fledged audit logging solution and do not   98   cover the REST API. There are a couple of packages for Django to add audit logging  capabilities:  ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment          django-simple-history  django-auditlog  django-simple-history can track changes on models. This capability, paired with   access logging, can provide effective audit logging for Django projects. django-simple-  history is a mature package, actively supported. On the other hand, django-auditlog  provides the same functionalities, but it is still in development at the time of this writing.   Cross-Origin Resource Sharing In a decoupled setup, JavaScript is the main consumer for REST and GraphQL APIs.  By default, JavaScript can request resources with XMLHttpRequest or fetch, as  long as the server and the frontend live in the same origin. An origin in HTTP is the  combination of the scheme or protocol, the domain, and the port. This means that the  origin http:  localhost:8000 is not equal to http:  localhost:3000. When JavaScript  attempts to fetch a resource from a different origin than its own, a mechanism known  as Cross-Origin Resource Sharing  CORS  kicks in the browser. In any REST or GraphQL  project, CORS is necessary to control what origins can connect to the API. To enable  CORS in Django, we can install django-cors-headers in our project with the following  command:  pip install django-cors-headers  shown in Listing 7-10.  To enable the package, include corsheaders in decoupled_dj settings base.py, as   Listing 7-10.  decoupled_dj settings base.py - Enabling django-cors-headers in  Django  INSTALLED_APPS = [    ...    'corsheaders',    ... ]  99   ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment  Next up, enable the CORS middleware as much higher in the list of middleware, as   shown in Listing 7-11.  Listing 7-11.  decoupled_dj settings base.py - Enabling CORS Middleware  MIDDLEWARE = [    ...    'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',    ... ]  With this change in place, we can configure django-cors-headers. In development,  we may want to allow all origins to bypass CORS altogether. To decoupled_dj settings  development.py, add the configuration shown in Listing 7-12.  Listing 7-12.  Decoupled_dj settings development.py - Relaxing CORS in  Development  CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True  In production, we have to be more restrictive. django-cors-headers allows us to  define a list of allowed origins, which can be configured in decoupled_dj settings  production.py, as shown in Listing 7-13.  Listing 7-13.  decoupled_dj settings production.py - Hardening CORS in  Production  CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [    "https:  example.com",    "http:  another1.io",    "http:  another2.io", ]  100  Since we are using variables per environment, we can make this configuration   directive a list, as shown in Listing 7-14.   Listing 7-14.  decoupled_dj settings production.py - Hardening CORS in  Production  ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment  CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = env.list     "CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS",    default=[]    This way we can define allowed origins as a comma-separated list in .env for   production. CORS is a basic form of protection for users, since without this mechanism  in place, any website would be able to fetch and inject malicious code in the page, and  a protection for REST APIs, which can explicitly allow a list of predefined origins instead  of being open to the world. Of course, CORS does not absolutely replace authentication,  which is covered briefly in the next section.   Authentication and Authorization in the DRF Authentication in the DRF integrates seamlessly with what Django already  provides out of the box. By default, the DRF authenticates the user with two classes,  SessionAuthentication and BasicAuthentication, aptly named after the two most  common authentication methods for websites. Basic authentication is a highly insecure  authentication method, even under HTTPS, and it makes sense to disable it altogether to  leave enabled at least only session-based authentication. To configure this aspect of the  DRF, open decoupled_dj settings base.py, add the REST_FRAMEWORK dictionary, and  configure the desired authentication classes, as shown in Listing 7-15.  Listing 7-15.  decoupled_dj settings base.py - Tweaking Authentication for the  Django REST Framework  REST_FRAMEWORK = {    "DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES": [        "rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication",    ], }  In web applications, authentication refers to the “who you are?” part of the   identification flow. Authorization instead looks at the “what can you do with your  credentials” part. In fact, authentication alone is not enough to protect resources in a   101   ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment  website or in a REST API. As of now, the REST API for our billing app is open to any user.  Specifically, we need to secure two DRF views in billing api views.py, summarized in  Listing 7-16.  Listing 7-16.  billing api views.py – The DRF View for the Billing App  from .serializers import InvoiceSerializer from .serializers import UserSerializer, User from rest_framework.generics import CreateAPIView, ListAPIView  class ClientList ListAPIView :    serializer_class = UserSerializer    queryset = User.objects.all    class InvoiceCreate CreateAPIView :    serializer_class = InvoiceSerializer  These two views handle the logic for the following endpoints:           billing api clients    billing api invoices   Right now, both are accessible by anyone. By default, the DRF does not enforce any   form of permission on views. The default permission class is AllowAny. To fix the security  of all DRF views in the project, we can apply the IsAdminUser permission globally. To do  so, in decoupled_dj settings base.py, we augment the REST_FRAMEWORK dictionary  with a permission class, as shown in Listing 7-17.  Listing 7-17.  decoupled_dj setting base.py - Adding Permissions Globally in the DRF  REST_FRAMEWORK = {    "DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES": [        "rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication",    ],    "DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES": [        "rest_framework.permissions.IsAdminUser"    ], }  102   Permission classes can be set not only globally, but also on a single view, depending   on the specific use case.  ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment  Note  We could also enforce these checks only in decoupled_dj settings  production.py. this means we won’t be bothered by authentication in  development. however, I prefer to apply authentication and authorization globally to  ensure a more realistic scenario, particularly in testing.   Disable the Browsable API The DRF eases most of the mundane work of building REST APIs. When we create an  endpoint, the DRF gives us a free web interface for interacting with the API. For example,  for creation views, we can access an HTML form to create new objects through the  interface. In this regard, the browsable API is a huge boon for developers because it  offers a convenient UI for interacting with the API. However, the interface can potentially  leak data and expose too many details if we forget to protect the API. By default, the DRF  uses BrowsableAPIRenderer to render the browsable API. We can change this behavior  by exposing only JSONRenderer. This configuration can be placed in decoupled_dj  settings production.py, as shown in Listing 7-18.  Listing 7-18.  decoupled_dj setting production.py - Disabling the Browsable API  in Production  ... REST_FRAMEWORK = {**REST_FRAMEWORK,    "DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES": ["rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer"] } ...  This disables the browsable API only in production.  103   ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment   Deploying a Decoupled Django Project The modern cloud landscape offers endless possibilities to deploy Django.  It would be impossible to cover every single deployment style, not counting Docker,   Kubernetes, and serverless setups. Instead, in this section, we employ one of the  most traditional setups for Django in production. With the help of Ansible, a popular  automation tool, we deploy Django, NGINX, and Gunicorn. Included in the source code  for this chapter there is an Ansible playbook, which is helpful to replicate the setup on  your own servers. From the preparation of the target machine to the configuration of  NGINX, the following sections cover the deployment theory for the project we have built  so far.  Note  the source code for the ansible playbook is at https:  github.com  valentinogagliardi decoupled- dj blob chapter_07_security_ deployment deployment site.yml. Instructions on how to launch the  playbook can be found in the readme.   Preparing the Target Machine To deploy Django, we need all the required packages in place: NGINX, Git, a newer  version of Python, and Certbot for requesting SSL certificates.  The Ansible playbook covers the installation of these packages. In this chapter, we   skip the installation of Postgres to keep things simple. The reader is encouraged to check  the PostgreSQL download page to see the installation instructions. On the target system,  there should also be an unprivileged user for the Django project. Once you’re done with  these prerequisites, you can move to configure NGINX, the reverse proxy.  Note  the ansible playbook expects ubuntu as the operating system used for the  deployment; a version not older than ubuntu 20.04 ltS is enough.  104   ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment   Configuring NGINX In a typical production arrangement, NGINX works at the edge of the system.  It receives requests from the users, deals with SSL, and forwards these requests to  a WSGI or ASGI server. Django lives behind this curtain. To configure NGINX, in this  example, we use the domain name decoupled-django.com and the subdomain static. decoupled-django.com. The NGINX configuration for a typical Django project is  composed of three sections at least:     One or more upstream declarations     A server declaration for the main Django entry point     A server declaration for serving static files  The deployment templates decoupled-django.com.j2 file includes the whole  configuration; here we outline just some details of the setup. The upstream directive  instructs NGINX about the location of the WSGI ASGI server. Listing 7-19 shows the  relevant configuration.  Listing 7-19.  deployment templates decoupled-django.com.j2 - Upstream  Configuration for NGINX  upstream gunicorn {    server 127.0.0.1:8000; }  In the first server block, we tell NGINX to forward all the requests for the main   domain to the upstream, as shown in Listing 7-20.  Listing 7-20.  deployment templates decoupled-django.com.j2 - Server  Configuration for NGINX  server {    server_name {{ domain }};     location   {        proxy_pass http:  gunicorn;        proxy_set_header Host $host;        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;  105   ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment         proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;    }      SSL configuration is managed by Certbot }  Here {{ domain }} is an Ansible variable declared in the playbook. What’s   important here is the proxy_pass directive, which forwards requests to Gunicorn. In  addition, in this section we also set headers for the proxy, which are handed down to  Django on each request. In particular, we have:          X-Real-IP and X-Forwarded-For, which ensure that Django gets the  IP address of the real visitor, not the address of the proxy  X-Forwarded-Proto, which tells Django which protocol the client is  connecting with  HTTP or HTTPS    Gunicorn and Django Production Requirements In Chapter 3, we introduced asynchronous Django, and we used Uvicorn to run Django  locally under ASGI. In production, we may want to run Uvicorn with Gunicorn. To do  so, we need to configure our dependencies for production. In the requirements folder,  create a new file named production.txt. In this file, we declare all the dependencies for  the ASGI part, as shown in Listing 7-21.  Listing 7-21.  requirements production.txt - Production Requirements  This file should land in the Git repo, as it will be used in the deployment phase. Let’s   now see how to prepare our Vue.js app for production.  -r . base.txt gunicorn==20.0.4 uvicorn==0.13.1 httptools==0.1.1 uvloop==0.15.2  106   ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment   Preparing Vue.js in Production with Django In Chapter 6, we saw how to serve Vue.js under Django in development. We configured  vue.config.js, and a file named .env.staging inside the root folder of the Vue.js app.  This time, we are going to ship things in production. This means we need a production  Vue.js bundle which should be served by NGINX, not from Django anymore. In regard  to static files, in production Django wants to know where it can find JavaScript and  CSS. This is configured in STATIC_URL, as in Listing 7-22, extracted from the beginning of  this chapter.  Listing 7-22.  decoupled_dj settings .env.production.example - Static  Configuration for Production  ... STATIC_URL=https:  static.decoupled-django.com  STATIC_ROOT=static  ...  Notice that we use https:  static.decoupled- django.com, and this subdomain   must be configured in NGINX. Listing 7-23 shows the subdomain configuration.  Listing 7-23.  deployment templates decoupled-django.com.j2 - Ansible  Template for NGINX  ... server {    server_name static.{{ domain }};     location   {        alias  home {{ user }} code static ;    } } ...  Here, {{ user }} is another variable defined in the Ansible playbook. After setting  up Django and NGINX, to configure Vue.js so that it “knows” that it will be served from  the above subdomain, we need to create another environment file in billing vue_spa,  named .env.production with the content shown in Listing 7-24.  107   ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment  Listing 7-24.  billing vue_spa .env.production - Production Configuration for Vue.js  VUE_APP_STATIC_URL=https:  static.decoupled-django.com billing   This tells Vue.js that its bundle will be served from a specific subdomain path. With   the file in place, if we move to the billing vue_spa folder, we can run the following  command:  npm run build -- --mode production  This will build the optimized Vue.js bundle in static billing. We now need to   push these files to the Git repo. After doing so, in the next section we finally see how to  deploy the project starting right from this repo.  Note  In real-world projects, production JavaScript bundles are not directly pushed  to source control. Instead, a continuous integration deployment system takes care of  building production assets, or docker images, after all the test suites pass.   The Deployment After building Vue for production locally and committing the files to the repo, we need to  deploy the actual code to the target machine.  To do so, we log in as the unprivileged user created in the previous steps  the Ansible  playbook defines a user called decoupled-django  or with SSH. Once done, we clone the  repo to a folder, which can be called code for convenience:  git clone --branch chapter_07_security_deployment https:  github.com  valentinogagliardi decoupled-dj.git code  This command clones the repo for the project from the specified branch   chapter_07_security_deployment. When the code is in place, we move to the newly  created folder, and we activate a Python virtual environment:  cd code python3.8 -m venv venv source venv bin activate  108   ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment  Next up, we install production dependencies with the following command:  pip install -r requirements production.txt  Before running Django, we need to configure the environment file for production.   This file must be placed in decoupled_dj settings .env. Extra care must be taken  when managing this file, as it contains sensitive credentials and the Django secret key.  In particular, .env files should never land in source control. Listing 7-25 recaps the  configuration directive for the production environment.  Listing 7-25.  decoupled_dj settings .env.production.example - Environment  Variables for Production  ALLOWED_HOSTS=decoupled-django.com,static.decoupled-django.com DEBUG=no SECRET_KEY=!changethis! DATABASE_URL=psql:  decoupleddjango:localpassword@127.0.0.1 decoupleddjango STATIC_URL=https:  static.decoupled-django.com  STATIC_ROOT=static   An example of this file is available in the source repo in decoupled_dj settings . env.production.example. With this file in place, we can switch Django to production  with the following command:  export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=decoupled_dj.settings.production  Finally, we can collect static assets with collectstatic and apply migrations:  python manage.py collectstatic --noinput python manage.py migrate  The first command will copy static files to  home decoupled-django code static,   which are picked up by NGINX. In the Ansible playbook there is a series of tasks to  automate all the steps presented here. Before running the project, we can create a  superuser to access protected routes:  python manage.py createsuperuser  109   ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment  To test things out, still in  home decoupled-django code, we can run Gunicorn with   the following command:  gunicorn decoupled_dj.asgi:application -w 2 -k uvicorn.workers. UvicornWorker -b 127.0.0.1:8000 --log-file -  The Ansible playbook also includes a Systemd service for setting up Gunicorn   at boot. If everything goes well, we can access https:  decoupled- django. com 77randomAdmin@33 , log in to the website with the superuser credentials, and visit  https:  decoupled- django.com billing , where our Vue.js app lives. Figure 7-1 shows  the result of our work.  Figure 7-1.  Django and the Vue.js app deployed in production  Again, the Ansible playbook covers the deployment from the Git repo as well. For   most projects, Ansible is a good starting point to set up and deploy your Django projects.  Other alternatives these days are Docker and Kubernetes, which more and more teams  have fully internalized into their deployment toolchains.  110   ChaPter 7    aPI SeCurIty and dePloyment  Note  It is a good moment to commit the changes you made so far, and to  push the work to your Git repo. you can find the source code for this chapter  at  https:  github.com valentinogagliardi decoupled- dj tree  chapter_07_security_deployment.   Summary We covered a lot in this chapter. We went over security and deployment. In the process,  you learned that:     Django is quite secure by default, but extra measures must be taken   when exposing a REST API  production setups     Django doesn’t work alone; a reverse proxy like NGINX is a must for      There are many ways to deploy Django; a configuration tool like   Ansible can work well in most cases  In the next chapter, we cover how Next.js, the React Framework, can be used as a   frontend for Django.   Additional Resource     OWASP REST Security Cheat Sheet  111   CHAPTER 8  Django REST Meets Next.js  This chapter covers:     Django as a content repo     React and its ecosystem     Vue.js and its ecosystem in brief  After having touched on security and deployment, in this chapter, we go back to   our local workstation to build a blog with Next.js, the React production framework, and  TypeScript.   Django as a Headless CMS Decoupled architectures based on REST and GraphQL have facilitated the rise in recent  years of a new trend: that of headless CMS.  With a backend that exclusively handles the data and serialization of the input output,   we can create consumer frontends that are totally decoupled from the backend. These  frontends are not limited only to act as single-page applications, but can also retrieve data  from the backend to build static websites. In this chapter, we introduce Next.js, a React  framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.   Building the Blog App There are countless books and tutorials on Django that use a blog application as the  most straightforward way to introduce beginners to this fantastic framework.  It might not be the most exciting application ever, but in our case it turns out to be a  perfect candidate for using Django as a content repository with JavaScript frameworks.  Let’s get started.    Valentino Gagliardi 2021  V. Gagliardi, Decoupled Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-7144-5_8  113   ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS  Note  This chapter assumes you are in the repo root decoupled-dj, with  the Python virtual environment active and the environment variable DJANGO_ SETTINGS_MODULE set to decoupled_dj.settings.development.   Building the Model For our blog app, we need a Blog model. This model should be connected to a User.  Each User should also be able to access its blog posts. To start off, we create the model in  blog models.py, as shown in Listing 8-1.  Listing 8-1.  blog models.py - Model for the Blog App  from django.db import models from django.conf import settings  class Blog models.Model :    class Status models.TextChoices :        PUBLISHED = "PUBLISHED"        UNPUBLISHED = "UNPUBLISHED"     user = models.ForeignKey         to=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,        on_delete=models.PROTECT,        related_name="blog_posts"         title = models.CharField max_length=160     body = models.TextField      status = models.CharField         max_length=15,        choices=Status.choices,        default=Status.UNPUBLISHED         created_at = models.DateTimeField auto_now_add=True   114   In this model, we define some of the most common fields for a blog entry:  ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS  title: The title for the blog entry  body: The text of the blog entry  created_at: The creation date                  status: Whether the entry is published or unpublished  On the user field we have a foreign key to User, with related_name aptly configured  so that the user can access its posts via the .blog_posts attribute in the ORM. We could  add much more fields, like a slug, but for the scope of this chapter, these are enough.   Enabling the App With the model in place, we enable the app in decoupled_dj settings base.py, as in  Listing 8-2.  Listing 8-2.  decoupled_dj settings base.py - Enabling the Blog App  INSTALLED_APPS = [    ...    "blog.apps.BlogConfig", ]  Finally, we apply the migrations:  python manage.py makemigrations python manage.py migrate  a Django shell:  python manage.py shell_plus  While we are there, let’s create a couple of blog entries in the database. First we open   Then we create the entries  >>> is the shell prompt :  >>> juliana = User.objects.create_user username="jul81", name="Juliana",  email="juliana@acme.io"  >>> Blog.objects.create title="Exploring Next.js", body="Dummy body",  user=juliana  >>> Blog.objects.create title="Decoupled Django", body="Dummy body", user=juliana   115   ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS  We will need these entries later, so this step can’t be skipped. With the app in place,   we are now ready to build the REST logic before moving on.   Building the REST Backend Our goal is to expose the Blog model to the outside. By doing so, any JavaScript client can  retrieve blog entries. As we did in Chapter 5 with the billing app, we need to wire up the  foundations of the DRF: serializers and views. In the next section, we build a serializer  for Blog and two views for exposing blog entries.   Building the Serializer To structure our REST API, we create a new Python package named api in blog.   In this package we place all the logic for our REST API. To start, let’s create a new file at  blog api serializers.py with the serializer in Listing 8-3.  Listing 8-3.  blog api serializers.py - DRF Serializer for the Blog Model  from blog.models import Blog from rest_framework import serializers  class BlogSerializer serializers.ModelSerializer :    class Meta:        model = Blog        fields = ["title",                  "body",                  "created_at",                  "status",                  "id"]  There is nothing arcane in this serializer: it exposes the fields of the model, minus   user. Save and close the file. With the serializer in place, we can build views and the URL  configuration.  116   ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS   Building the Views and the URL For this project we need two views:     A ListAPIView to expose the whole list of posts     A RetrieveAPIView to expose single entries  We create views in a new file at blog api views.py, as shown in Listing 8-4.  Listing 8-4.  blog api views.py - REST Views for Our Blog  from .serializers import BlogSerializer from blog.models import Blog from rest_framework.generics import ListAPIView, RetrieveAPIView  class BlogList ListAPIView :    serializer_class = BlogSerializer    queryset = Blog.objects.all    class BlogDetail RetrieveAPIView :    serializer_class = BlogSerializer    queryset = Blog.objects.all    Next up, we create a URL configuration in a new file at blog urls.py. As usual, we  give this configuration an app_name, which is useful to namespace the app in the root  URL configuration, as shown in Listing 8-5.  Listing 8-5.  blog urls.py - URL Configuration for the Blog App  from django.urls import path from .api.views import BlogList, BlogDetail  app_name = "blog"  urlpatterns = [    path "api posts ",         BlogList.as_view  ,         name="list" ,  117   ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS     path "api posts  ",         BlogDetail.as_view  ,         name="detail" , ]  shown in Listing 8-6.  Finally, we include the URL configuration for our blog in decoupled_dj urls.py, as   Listing 8-6.  blog urls.py - Project URL Configuration  from django.urls import path, include  urlpatterns = [    ...    path "blog ", include "blog.urls", namespace="blog"  , ]  After running the Django development server, we should be able to access the   endpoint at http:  localhost:8000 blog api posts . This will be the data source for  Next.js.  Note  To avoid being bothered by authentication in this chapter, you can  temporarily comment DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES in decoupled_dj  setting base.py.   Introduction to the React Ecosystem React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces that took web development by  storm.  The React approach to building user interfaces by the means of components,   isolated units of markup, and JavaScript code is not new to the scene. However, thanks  to its flexibility, React gained huge popularity, surpassing Angular and Vue.js as the  library of choice for building single-page apps. In the next sections, we recap React  fundamentals and introduce Next.js, the React framework for production.  118   ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS   A Reintroduction to React Most of the time, user interfaces are not a single whole: they are made of independent  units, each one in control of a specific aspect of the whole interface.  If we think of a   HTML element for example, we may notice that in a typical   application it rarely appears just once. Instead, it can be used multiple times in the  same interface. In the beginning, web developers  myself included  reused part of the  application by copy-pasting the same markup over and over. However, this approach  often led to an unsustainable mess. In the past the question was: “How do I reuse this  markup alongside with its JavaScript logic”? React filled this huge gap, which still affects  the web platform to some extent: the lack of native components, that is, reusable pieces  of markup and logic.  It is worth noting that Web Components  native components for building   Note  interfaces  are a reality, but the specification still has a lot of rough edges.  React favors a component-based approach to building user interfaces. In the   beginning, React components were built as ES2015 classes due to their ability to retain  internal state. With the advent of hooks, a React component can be built as a simple  JavaScript function, as in Listing 8-7.  Listing 8-7.  React Component Example  import React, { useState } from "react";  export default function Button props  {  const [text, setText] = useState "" ;  return        setText "CLICKED" }>      {text  props.initialText}        ; }  119   ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS  In this example we define a Button component as a JavaScript function. In the  component we use the useState hook to hold the internal state. When we click on  the button, the onClick handler  which React maps to the click DOM event  triggers  setText  , which changes the internal state of the component. Additionally, the  component takes props from the outside, that is, a read-only object that takes an  arbitrary number of properties that the component can use to render data to the user.  Once we create a component, we can reuse it infinitely, as shown in Listing 8-8.  Listing 8-8.  React Component Usage Example  import Button from ". Button";  export default function App   {  return                     ; }  120  Here we have an App root component that nests our Button two times. From the   outside we pass an initialText property. React components are not always that simple,  but this example summarizes the grand theory of React and serves to pave the road for  the next sections.   Introduction to Next.js Building single-page applications might look easy. We became accustomed to using  tools like create-react-app and Vue CLI to create new SPA projects.  These tools give the illusion that the work is done, which is true to some extent.   The reality is that things are not so straightforward in production. Depending on  the project, we need routing, efficient data fetching, search engine optimization,  internationalization, and performance and image optimization. Next.js is a framework  for React, born to ease the burden of setting up things manually over and over again, and  to provide developers with an opinionated production-ready environment.  In Chapter 2, we talked briefly about universal JavaScript applications, touching   on the ability to share and reuse code between the backend and frontend. Next.js falls    exactly in this category of tools, as it enables developers to write server-side rendered  JavaScript applications. Next.js has two principal modes of operation:  ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS     Server-side rendering     Static site generation  In the next sections, we investigate both while building our blog frontend with   React and TypeScript. It’s important to remark that these kinds of frameworks cannot  directly integrate with Django because they have their own server, operated by Node.js.  A typical Next.js setup operates independently of any other backend; it handles routing,  authentication, internationalization, and everything in between. In this arrangement, a  framework like Django provides just the data for Next.js over a REST or GraphQL API.   Building the Next.js Frontend To start, we initialize a Next.js project. From the root project folder decoupled_dj ,  launch the following command:  npx create-next-app --use-npm next-blog  This will create the project in decoupled_dj next-blog. Once the project is in place,   move into the folder:  cd next-blog  following command:  touch tsconfig.json  npm run dev  From inside the Next.js project folder, install TypeScript and a couple of other type   definitions, one for Node,js and another for React:  npm i typescript @types react @types node --save-dev  When the installation finishes, create a configuration file for TypeScript with the   In this file, depending on the level of strictness we want TypeScript to enforce, we   can leave the strict option set to false. However, for most projects we may want to set  it to true. With the file in place, launch the Next.js development server:  121   ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS  This will start Next.js on http:  localhost:3000. If everything goes well, you should   see the following output from the console:  ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http:  localhost:3000 We detected TypeScript in your project and created a tsconfig.json file for  you.  From there, we are ready to write our first component.   Pages and Routing The basic theory of Next.js revolves around the concept of pages.  If we look in the newly created project, we should see a folder named pages. In this  folder, we can define subfolders. For example, by creating a new folder at pages posts,  when running the Next.js project, we can access http:  localhost:3000 posts .  Nothing particularly exciting. The interesting part comes with React components. Any. js, .jsx, .ts, or .tsx file placed in pages becomes a page for Next.js. To understand how  Next.js works, we create a page step by step by starting with fixed data first, to introduce  data fetching later.  Note  For the next.js part, from now on we work in decoupled_dj next-blog.  each proposed file must be created in the appropriate subfolder, starting from this path.  We are going to create a simple page in Next.js. For the following example, create  a new file in pages posts index.tsx, with the following React component shown in  Listing 8-9.  Listing 8-9.  pages posts index.tsx - A First Next.js Page  const BlogPost =    => {  return              Post title                 Post body          122   ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS         ; };  export default BlogPost;  development server:  npm run dev  This is a React component, and it’s also already a page for Next.js. Let’s run the   Now, we can head over to http:  localhost:3000 posts, and we should be able   to see a simple page with the content we placed in the React component. Interesting  indeed, but a bit useless for a dynamic website. What if we want to show different blog  posts, maybe by fetching them by id?  In Next.js, we can use dynamic routing to build pages on demand. For example, a  user should be able to access http:  localhost:3000 posts 2 and see the desired  content there. For this to work, we need to change the filename of our component from  index.ts to the following:  [id].tsx  By doing so, Next.js will respond to any request for http:  localhost:3000   posts $id where $id here is a placeholder for whichever numeric ID we can imagine.  With this information, the component can fetch data from the REST API, based on the  id, which for Next.js becomes a URL parameter. With this knowledge, let’s enrich the  component with type declarations before moving to data fetching. Wipe everything out  from the component we created a minute ago and place the following code in pages  posts [id].tsx, as shown in Listing 8-10.  Listing 8-10.  pages posts [id]tsx - Blog Component for the Corresponding Next. js Page  enum BlogPostStatus {  Published = "PUBLISHED",  Unpublished = "UNPUBLISHED", }  type BlogPost = {  title: string;  123   ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS   body: string;  created_at: string;  status: BlogPostStatus;  id: number; };  const BlogPost =  { title, body, created_at }: BlogPost  => {  return                       {title}           Published on: {created_at}                        {body}                ; };  export default BlogPost;  This component is statically typed with TypeScript. There are three specific   TypeScript notations in this file. Here’s an explanation:              BlogPostStatus: TypeScript enum that defines a set of possible states  for the blog post. It maps the nested Status class defined in the  Django model.  BlogPost: TypeScript type that defines the properties for our React  component. It maps the model’s fields  minus user .  BlogPost: Used in the component parameter to strongly type our  props.  With this component in place, we are now ready to define the data fetching logic to   populate each blog post with its corresponding data.  124   ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS  In TypeScript, enums produce a lot of javaScript code during compilation. a   Note  solution to this are const enums, but they are not supported by Babel, which next. js uses for compiling TypeScript to javaScript.   Data Fetching Next.js can operate in two modes, as introduced earlier:     Server-side rendering     Static site generation  With server-side rendering, pages are built on each request, much like a traditional  server-side rendered website. Think of Django templates or Rails. In this mode, we can  fetch data on each request, as the user hits the corresponding path. In Next.js this is done  with getServerSideProps. This should be an asynchronous method, exported from the  same file where the React component lives. There are two things we need to take care of  in getServerSideProps:     Fetch the desired data     Return at least a props object  Once these are done, Next.js will take care of passing props to our React component.   Listing 8-11 shows an example skeleton of the function, complete with types.  Listing 8-11.  getServerSideProps Skeleton  export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async  context  => {     fetch data  return { props: {} }; };  The context object parameter carries information about the request, the response,   and a params object on which we can access the request parameters. We will destructure  params from context for convenience. Let’s add this function to pages posts [id].tsx,  as shown in Listing 8-12, with the corresponding data fetching logic.  125   ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS  Listing 8-12.  pages posts [id].tsx - Data Fetching Logic for the Page  import { GetServerSideProps } from "next";  const BASE_URL = "http:  localhost:8000 blog api";  export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async  { params }  =>  {  const id = params?.id;   const res = await fetch `${BASE_URL} posts ${id}` ;   if  !res.ok  {    return {      notFound: true,    };  }   const json = await res.json  ;  const { title, body, created_at, status } = json;   return { props: { title, body, created_at, status } }; };     We import the GetServerSideProps type, which is used to give typing   This code bears a bit of explanation:  to the actual function      In getServerSideProps:     We get the id from params     We fetch data from the Django REST API     We return notFound if the response from the API is negative     We return a props object for our component if the backend   returns the blog post  126   ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS  Note  getServerSideProps has a lot more return properties, which are  convenient for specific use cases. Take a look at the official documentation to learn  more.  With this code in place, we can test things out. First off, Django must be running. In a   terminal, go to decoupled_dj and launch Django:  python manage.py runserver  In the other terminal where you launched Next.js, run the development server if it   isn’t already running  from the decoupled_dj next_blog folder :  npm run dev  Now, access http:  localhost:3000 posts 1 or http:  localhost:3000 posts 2.   You should see a blog post, as shown in Figure 8-1.  Figure 8-1.  Next.js is responding to the detail route for a single blog post  As you can see, this approach works flawlessly. In this mode, Next.js retrieves data  before sending the page to the user. But for a blog, this is not the best approach: there  is no better website than a static website for making search engines happy. The next  section explains how to implement data fetching and static site generation with Next.js.  127    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS  ChaPTer 8   Static Site Generation It’s a bit inefficient to call the REST API every time we want to display a blog post to our  users.  Blogs are better served as static pages. Other than data fetching on each request,   Next.js supports also data fetching at build time. In this mode we can generate pages and  their corresponding data as static HTML, which Next.js will serve to our users. To make  this work, we need a combination of two other methods from Next.js: getStaticPaths  and getStaticProps. What’s the difference between getServerSideProps from the  previous section and these methods?  getServerSideProps is used to asynchronously fetch data on each request in server-   side rendering. That is, when the user reaches a given page, it has to wait a bit because  the Next.js server has to fetch the data from the given sources  a REST API or a GraphQL  service . This approach is convenient for data that is dynamic and changes a lot.  getStaticProps, instead, is used to asynchronously fetch data at build time. That is,   when we run npm run build or yarn build, Next.js creates a production bundle with  all the JavaScript it needs, plus any page marked as static. Listing 8-13 shows an example  skeleton of the function.  Listing 8-13.  getStaticProps Example  import { GetStaticProps } from "next";  const BASE_URL = "http:  localhost:8000 blog api";  export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async  _  => {  const res = await fetch `${BASE_URL} posts 1` ;   const json = await res.json  ;  const { title, body, created_at, status } = json;   return { props: { title, body, created_at, status } }; };  Notice how we call http:  localhost:8000 blog api 1 specifically, which is   rather limiting. After the build phase, Next.js generates the corresponding static pages.  By running npm run start or yarn start, Next.js can serve our website. When a page  exports getStaticProps, the related component receives props returned from this  method. However, to make our example work, the page must have a fixed path, like   128   ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS  1.tsx. It would be impractical to know beforehand the ID of every blog post in our  backend. This is where getStaticPaths comes into play. With this method, used in  combination with getStaticProps, we can generate a list of paths that getStaticProps  can use to fetch data. To take advantage of static site generation, let’s change pages  posts [id].tsx so that it uses getStaticPaths and getStaticProps instead of  getServerSideProps, as shown in Listing 8-14.  Listing 8-14.  pages posts [id].tsx - Data Fetching at Build Time with  getStaticPaths and getStaticProps  import { GetStaticPaths, GetStaticProps } from "next";  const BASE_URL = "http:  localhost:8000 blog api";  export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async  _  => {  const res = await fetch `${BASE_URL} posts ` ;  const json: BlogPost[] = await res.json  ;  const paths = json.map  post  => {    return { params: { id: String post.id  } };  } ;   return {    paths,    fallback: false,  }; };   if  !res.ok  {    return {      notFound: true,    };  }  export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async  { params }  => {  const id = params?.id;   const res = await fetch `${BASE_URL} posts ${id}` ;  129   ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS   const json: BlogPost = await res.json  ;  const { title, body, created_at, status } = json;   return { props: { title, body, created_at, status } }; };  Here, the logic for getStaticProps is the same used for getServerSideProps from   the previous section. However, we also have getStaticPaths. In this function, we:     Call the REST API to get a list of all posts from   http:  127.0.0.1:8000 blog api posts      Generate and return an array of paths  This array of paths is important and must have the following shape:     paths: [      { params: { id: 1 } },      { params: { id: 2 } },      { params: { id: 3 } },    ]  In our code it is generated by the following snippet:  ...  const paths = json.map  post  => {    return { params: { id: String post.id  } };  } ; ...  In the return object for getStaticPaths, there is also a fallback option. It’s used to  display a 404 page for any path not included in paths. At this point we can build the blog  with the following command:  Note that Django must still be running in another terminal. Once the build is ready,   we should see static pages in .next server pages posts. To serve the blog  at least  locally for now , we run the following command:  npm run build  npm run start  130   ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS  Now, access http:  localhost:3000 posts 1 or http:  localhost:3000 posts 2  and you should see a blog post, as shown in Figure 8-1. Apparently, nothing changes for  the user between this version and the previous version with getServerSideProps. But if  we stop the Django API, we can still access our blog, since now it’s just a bunch of static  pages, and more important, the performance gains of static HTML can’t be beaten.  Note  getStaticProps and getServerSideProps are not mutually exclusive.  Pages in a next.js project can use both depending on the use case. For example,  part of a site can be served as static hTML, while another section can operate as a  single-page application.  We covered a lot. The concept exposed here might seem a bit too much seen in the  context of a simple blog. After all, Django alone would be enough to handle this type of  website. But more and more teams are adopting these kinds of setups, where frontend  developers can use the tool they love most to shape the UI, ranging from single-page  apps to static websites.   Deploying Next.js Next.js is a full-fledged React framework. It needs its own Node.js server, which is already  integrated, and this also means it can’t run inside Django. Usually, the deployment  is structured to have a Django backend and the Next.js system on their own separate  machines containers.   Using React with Django In 2019, I published a post on my blog entitled, “Django REST with React.”  The tutorial illustrates how to configure a webpack environment to build React in  the right Django static folder, much like we did in Chapter 5 with Vue.js. The approach  outlined in that blog post is not inherently bad, but it can fall short for larger teams,  and due to potential breaking changes in webpack, it can become hard to keep up with  changes. A solution to this is the popular create-react-app, which abstracts away all the  mundane details related to webpack and Babel. However, to make Django work with  create-react-app, Django must be instructed to look for React static files. This involves  tweaking the DIRS key in TEMPLATES and STATICFILES_DIRS.  131   ChaPTer 8    Django reST MeeTS nexT.jS   The Vue.js Ecosystem To a casual observer, the modern web development land might seem totally dominated  by React.  That couldn’t be further from the truth. Vue.js and Angular occupy a good market   share. Vue.js has a framework called Nuxt.js, equivalent in functionality to Next.js. There  isn’t enough space to cover everything in this book, but given that Next.js and  Nuxt. js have almost total feature parity, developers accustomed to working with Vue.js can  apply the same concepts seen in this chapter to their framework of choice. In fact, you’re  encouraged to give Nuxt.js a try.  Note  It is a good moment to commit the changes you made so far and to  push the work to your git repo. You can find the source code for this chapter  at https:  github.com valentinogagliardi decoupled- dj tree  chapter_08_django_rest_meets_next.

In the first part, we cover functional   testing for user interfaces with Cypress. In the second part, we move to unit testing in  Django.  Note  This chapter assumes you are in the repo root decoupled-dj, with the  Python virtual environment active.   Introduction to Functional Testing More often than not, testing in software development is an afterthought, something  overlooked as a waste of time that slows down development.  This is especially true of functional testing for user interfaces, where the amount of   JavaScript interactions to test increases day by day. This feeling probably comes from  the memory of tools like Selenium for Python, which unfortunately are notably slow  and hard to use for testing JavaScript interfaces. However, the situation has changed  substantially in recent years, with a new breed of JavaScript tooling that eases the  burden of testing single-page applications. These tools make it easy to write tests for  the interface from the user point of view. Functional tests are also a great way to catch     Valentino Gagliardi 2021  V.

In the next sections, we cover  Cypress, a test runner for JavaScript.   Getting Started with Cypress Cypress is a JavaScript package available on NPM that can be pulled in our projects. In a  project with a single JavaScript frontend that needs to be tested, you can install Cypress  in the root project folder of the React Vue.js app.  In our case, since we might have more than one JavaScript application to test, we can  install Cypress in the root project folder decoupled-dj. To start, initialize a package.json  with the following command:  npm init -y  Next up, install Cypress:  npm i cypress --save-dev  Once you’re done, you can start Cypress the first time with the following command:  . node_modules .bin cypress open  This command will open a window and create a new folder named cypress in the   root project folder. A number of subfolders are created as well, as shown in the following  directory listing:  For the scope of this chapter we can safely ignore these folders, except integration.  We will place our tests there. With Cypress in place, we can move to writing our first test  in the next sections.  cypress ├── fixtures ├── integration ├── plugins └── support  134   ChaPTer 9    TesTing in a DeCouPleD WorlD   Understanding Functional Testing for the Billing App Remember the billing app from Chapter 6? It’s now time to write functional tests for it.  This app has a form where the user can fill in fields to create a new invoice and then   click on Create Invoice to create the new entity on the backend. Figure 9-1 shows the  final form from Chapter 6.  Figure 9-1.  The invoice form from Chapter 6  Let’s not forget that we want to test the interface from the user point of view in a  functional test. With a nice fluent syntax, Cypress allows us to interact with elements  just like a user would do, step by step. How do we know how and what to test? Writing  a functional test should come naturally. We need to imagine how a user would   135   ChaPTer 9    TesTing in a DeCouPleD WorlD  interact with the interface, write selectors for each HTML element we want to test, and  then verify that the element behaves correctly or that it changes in response to user  interaction. In the case of our form, we can identify the following steps. The user should:     Select a client for the invoice     Compile at least one invoice line with quantity, description, and price     Pick a date for the invoice     Pick a due date for the invoice     Submit the form by clicking on Create Invoice  All these steps must be translated into Cypress logic, which is essentially just   JavaScript. In the next section, we write our first test for the   element of the form.   Creating the First Test In the first iteration of our test, we interact with two pieces of the interface. In particular, we:     Target the form      Interact with the select  In Cypress, these two steps translate into method calls, which look almost like plain  English. To start, create a new test in cypress integration Billing.spec.js with the  code shown in Listing 9-1.  Listing 9-1.  cypress integration Billing.spec.js - A First Test Skeleton in Cypress  context "Billing app",    => {  describe "Invoice creation",    => {    it "can create a new invoice",    => {      cy.visit "http:  localhost:8080 "  ;      cy.get "form" .within    => {        cy.get "select" .select "Juliana - juliana@acme.io" ;      } ;    } ;  } ; } ;  136   ChaPTer 9    TesTing in a DeCouPleD WorlD  Let’s break down these instructions:                                      context   encloses the whole test and gives it a cohesive  organization  describe   encloses a single aspect of our test, often used in  conjunction with context    it   is the actual test block  cy.visit   navigates to the app home page  cy is Cypress itself, which offers a number of methods for selecting  and interacting with elements  cy.get "form"  selects the first form in the interface  within   tells Cypress to run each subsequent command from inside  the previous selected element  cy.get "select"  selects the   element inside the form  cy.get "select" .select "Juliana - juliana@acme.io"  picks  the   element whose value is "Juliana - juliana@acme.io"  from the select  Note  since our interface is rather simple, we won’t focus too much on advanced  selectors and best practices. The reader is encouraged to read the Cypress  documentation to learn more about advanced techniques.  What stands out from this code is the expressiveness of each statement. With fluent,   descriptive methods, we can target and interact with HTML elements the same way as  we would expect from our users. In theory, our test is ready to run, but there’s a problem.  The   needs data from the network. This data comes from the Vue component’s  mounted   method, as shown in Listing 9-2.  137   ChaPTer 9    TesTing in a DeCouPleD WorlD  Listing 9-2.  billing vue_spa src components InvoiceCreate.vue - The Form’s  Mounted Method  ...  mounted   {    fetch " billing api clients "       .then response => {        if  !response.ok  throw Error response.statusText ;        return response.json  ;      }       .then json => {        this.users = json;      } ;  } ...  In fact, if we launch the Vue.js app, we’ll see the following error in the console:  Proxy error: Could not proxy request  billing api clients  from  localhost:8080 to http:  localhost:8000  This comes from Vue.js development server, which we instructed to proxy all   network requests to the Django REST API in development. Without running Django  in another terminal, we can’t really test anything. This is where Cypress network  interception comes into play. It turns out that we can intercept the network call and  reply to it directly from Cypress. To do so, we need to adjust our test by adding a new  command called cy.intercept  , before cy.visit  , as shown in Listing 9-3.  Listing 9-3.  cypress integration Billing.spec.js - Adding Network Interception to  the Test  context "Billing app",    => {  describe "Invoice creation",    => {    it "can create a new invoice",    => {      cy.intercept "GET", " billing api clients", {        statusCode: 200,        body: [  138   ChaPTer 9    TesTing in a DeCouPleD WorlD           {            id: 1,            name: "Juliana",            email: "juliana@acme.io",          },        ],      } ;       cy.visit "http:  localhost:8080 " ;      cy.get "form" .within    => {        cy.get "select" .select           "Juliana - juliana@acme.io"         ;      } ;    } ;  } ; } ;  From this snippet, we can see that cy.intercept   takes:     The HTTP method to intercept     The path to intercept     An object used as a response stub  In this test we intercept the network request coming from the Vue component, we   stop it before it reaches the backend, and we reply with a static response body. By doing  so, we can avoid touching the backend altogether. Now, to test things out, we can run the  test suite. From the decoupled-dj folder where we installed Cypress, we run the testing  runner with the following command:  . node_modules .bin cypress open  Note  For convenience, it’s best to create an e2e script in package.json to  alias cypress open.  139   ChaPTer 9    TesTing in a DeCouPleD WorlD  This will open a new window from where we can choose which test to run, as shown   in Figure 9-2.  Figure 9-2.  Cypress welcome page  By clicking on the spec file Billing.spec.js, we can run the test, but before doing so  we need to start the Vue.js app. From another terminal, move into billing vue_spa and  run the following command:  npm run serve  Once done we can reload the test and let Cypress do the job. The test runner will  go over every command in the test block, just like a real user would do. When the test  finishes we should see all green, which is a sign that the test is passing. Figure 9-3 shows  the test window.  140   ChaPTer 9    TesTing in a DeCouPleD WorlD  Figure 9-3.  A first passing test  Network interception in Cypress is really convenient for working without a backend.  The backend team can share the expected API request and responses with the frontend  team through documentation, with actual JavaScript objects, or with JSON fixtures.  On the other side, frontend developers can build the UI without having to run Django  locally. In the next section we finish the test for our form by testing form inputs.   Filling and Submitting the Form In order to submit the form, Cypress needs to fill all the required fields. To do so, we employ a set of Cypress methods for form interaction:          type   to type into input fields  submit   to trigger the submit event on our form  141   ChaPTer 9    TesTing in a DeCouPleD WorlD  With type   we can not only type into form fields, but also interact with date inputs.   This is really handy since our form has two inputs of type date. For example, to select  and type into a date input with Cypress, we can use the following command:  cy.get "input[name=date]" .type "2021-03-15" ;  Here, we target the input with the appropriate selector and use type   to fill the   field. This method works well with any kind of form input. For text inputs, it’s a matter  of targeting the CSS selector and type into it. When two or more inputs of the same type  exist on the page, Cypress needs to know which one to target. If we are only interested in  the first element found on the page, we can use the following instructions:  cy.get "input[type=number]" .first  .type "1" ;  Here we say to Cypress to select only the first input number on the page. What if   we wanted to interact with two or more elements of the same kind instead? As a quick  workaround, we can use .eq   to target the element by index. The index starts at 0,  much like JavaScript arrays:  cy.get "input[type=number]" .eq 0 .type "1" ; cy.get "input[type=number]" .eq 1 .type "600.00" ;  In this example, we instruct Cypress to target two inputs of type number on the page.   With this knowledge in hand, and with an eye on the HTML form structure of our app,  we can add the code shown in Listing 9-4 to our previous test.  Listing 9-4.  cypress integration Billing.spec.js - Filling the Form with Cypress  ...      cy.get "form" .within    => {        cy.get "select" .select           "Juliana - juliana@acme.io"         ;         cy.get "input[name=date]" .type "2021-03-15" ;        cy.get "input[name=due_date]" .type "2021-03-30" ;        cy.get "input[type=number]" .eq 0 .type "1" ;        cy.get "input[name=description]" .type           "Django consulting"         ;  142   ChaPTer 9    TesTing in a DeCouPleD WorlD         cy.get "input[type=number]" .eq 1 .type "5000.00" ;      } ;       cy.get "form" .submit  ; ...  Here we fill all the required inputs, the two dates, the description for the invoice,   and the price. Finally, we submit the form. While this test passes, Vue.js isn’t that happy  because it cannot route the POST request to  billing api invoices . In the console, we  can see the following error:  Proxy error: Could not proxy request  billing api invoices  from  localhost:8080 to http:  localhost:8000  This is another situation where Cypress interception can help. Before submitting the  form, let’s declare another interception, this time for  billing api invoices. Also, let’s  assert that the API call is triggered by the frontend; see Listing 9-5.  Listing 9-5.  cypress integration Billing.spec.js - Adding Another Network  Interception to the Test  ...      cy.intercept "POST", " billing api invoices", {        statusCode: 201,        body: {},      } .as "createInvoice" ;       cy.get "form" .submit  ;      cy.wait "@createInvoice" ; ...  The new instructions here are as   and cy.wait  . With as  , we can alias Cypress  selections, and in this case also our network intercept. With cy.wait   instead, we can  wait for the network call to happen and effectively test that the frontend is making the  actual API call to the backend. With this test in place we can run again Cypress, which  should now give us all green, as shown in Figure 9-4.  143   ChaPTer 9    TesTing in a DeCouPleD WorlD  Figure 9-4.  A full test suite for our invoice form  This concludes functional testing for the client-facing side of our app. Although   limited in scope, this test helps illustrate the Cypress fundamentals. The test we wrote  so far targets Vue.js without considering Django. To make our functional tests as close  possible to the real world, we would also need to test the JavaScript frontend served from  within Django. This is left as an exercise for the user at the end of the chapter. Let’s now  focus on the backend. Our REST API needs testing as well.  144   ChaPTer 9    TesTing in a DeCouPleD WorlD   Introduction to Unit Testing In contrast to functional testing, unit testing aims at ensuring that single units of code  such as functions or classes work as expected.  In this chapter we don’t cover unit testing for JavaScript because we already saw   functional testing with Cypress, and to properly address unit testing for React and Vue. js, another chapter would not be enough. Instead, we see how to apply unit testing to the  Django backend. Functional testing is an invaluable tool for checking the functionality of  the UI from the user point of view. Unit testing instead ensures that our Django backend  and its REST API provide the right data for our JavaScript frontend. Functional testing  and unit testing are not mutually exclusive. A project should have both types of tests in  place in order to be considered robust and resilient to changes. In the next section, we  see how to test the Django REST Framework with Django testing tools.   Unit Testing in the Django REST Framework Out of the box, Django makes it possible to have excellent code coverage right from  the beginning. Code coverage is the measure of how much code is covered by tests.  Django is a battery included framework, and it comes with a robust set of tools, like API  views and a fantastic ORM, which are already tested by Django contributors and core  developers. However, these tests aren’t enough.  When building a project, we need to make sure that views, models, serializers, and   any custom Python class or function are properly tested. Luckily, Django has us covered  with a set of handy tools for unit and integration testing, like the TestCase class. The  Django REST Framework adds some custom tooling on top of this, including:          APISimpleTestCase for testing the API without database support  APITestCase for testing the API along with database support  Writing a unit test for a DRF view is not so different from writing a test for a   traditional Django view. The example in Listing 9-6 illustrates the minimal test structure  for getting started.  145   ChaPTer 9    TesTing in a DeCouPleD WorlD  Listing 9-6.  Django REST Test Example  from rest_framework.test import APITestCase from rest_framework.status import HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN from django.urls import reverse  class TestBillingAPI APITestCase :    @classmethod    def setUpTestData cls :        pass     def test_anon_cannot_list_clients self :        response = self.client.get reverse "billing:client-list"          self.assertEqual response.status_code, HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN   In this example, we subclass APITestCase to declare a new test suite. Inside this class  we can see a class method named setUpTestData  , which is useful for initializing data  for our test. Next up we declare our first test as a class method: test_anon_cannot_list_ clients   is our first test. Inside this block, we call the API view with self.client. get  , the testing HTTP client. Then, we check that the response code we get from the  view is what we expect, a 403 Forbidden in this case, since the user is not authenticated.  In the next sections, we write tests for our REST views by following the example’s  structure.   Django Settings for Testing Before getting started, let’s configure our Django project for testing. More often than  not, we will need to slightly change some setting in testing, and for this reason it is  convenient to create a split setting for the testing environment. To do so, create a new file  in decoupled_dj settings testing.py with the content shown in Listing 9-7.  Listing 9-7.  decoupled_dj settings testing.py - Split Settings for Testing  from .base import *   noqa  As of now, this file doesn’t do anything other than import the base settings, but this   ensures that we can override any configuration if needed.  146   ChaPTer 9    TesTing in a DeCouPleD WorlD   Installing the Dependencies and Configuring  Requirements for Testing We are now ready to install the dependencies for testing.  For our project, we will use two convenient libraries: pytest and pytest-django.   Used together they can simplify how we run tests. For instance, when used with pytest-  django, pytest can autodiscover our tests, so we don’t need to add imports to our  __init__.py files. We will also use model-bakery, which can ease the burden of model  creation in our tests. To install these libraries, run the following command:  pip install pytest pytest-django model-bakery  Next up, create a requirements file for testing in requirements testing.txt and add   the lines shown in Listing 9-8.  Listing 9-8.  requirements testing.txt - Requirements for Testing  -r . base.txt model-bakery==1.2.1 pytest==6.2.2 pytest-django==4.1.0  This concludes our setup. We are now ready to write tests!   Outlining Tests for the Billing REST API When writing tests, understanding what to test in a project is the most challenging task,  especially for beginners.  It is easy to get lost in the testing implementation details and internal code, but   really, it shouldn’t be that complicated. When deciding what to test, you need to focus  on one thing: the expected output from your system. In the case of our Django apps, we  are exposing REST endpoints. This means we need to look at how this system is used and  test these boundaries accordingly. After identifying the surface of the system, tests for  the internal logic will come naturally. Let’s now see what needs to be tested in our billing  app. The Vue frontend from Chapter 5 invokes the following endpoints:           billing api clients    billing api invoices   147   ChaPTer 9    TesTing in a DeCouPleD WorlD  Incidentally, these are the same endpoints that we stubbed in Cypress with    cy.intercept  . This time we need to cover them with a unit test in Django, rather than  with a functional test with Cypress. But let’s step back for a moment and think about  our tests. In Chapter 6, we added authentication and permissions check to our REST  API. Only an authenticated admin user can invoke the API. This means we need to take  authentication into account and test that we don’t forget to enforce authentication by  allowing anonymous users to sneak into our API. By intuition, we need to write the  following tests:     As an anonymous user, I cannot access the client list     As an admin user, I can access the client list     As an anonymous user, I cannot create a new invoice     As an admin user, I can create a new invoice  Let’s write these tests in the next section.   Testing the Billing REST API To start, create a new Python package named tests in billing.  In this folder create a new file called test_api.py. In this file, we are going to place  our test class, with the same structure we saw in the previous example. We also add all  the test methods to our class, as outlined in the previous section. Listing 9-9 shows the  backbone of this test.  Listing 9-9.  billing tests test_api.py - Test Case for the Billing API  from rest_framework.test import APITestCase from rest_framework.status import HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, HTTP_200_OK,  HTTP_201_CREATED from django.urls import reverse  class TestBillingAPI APITestCase :    @classmethod    def setUpTestData cls :        pass  148   ChaPTer 9    TesTing in a DeCouPleD WorlD     def test_anon_cannot_list_clients self :        response = self.client.get reverse "billing:client-list"          self.assertEqual response.status_code, HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN      def test_admin_can_list_clients self :         TODO: authenticate as admin        response = self.client.get reverse "billing:client-list"          self.assertEqual response.status_code, HTTP_200_OK      def test_anon_cannot_create_invoice self :        response = self.client.post             reverse "billing:invoice-create" , data={}, format="json"                 self.assertEqual response.status_code, HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN   This test is far from being complete. Tests for the anonymous user look fine, but we   can’t say the same for admin because we are not authenticated in our tests yet. To create  an admin user  a staff user for Django  in our tests, we can use baker   from model-  bakery in setUpTestData  , and then the force_login   method on the test client, as in  Listing 9-10.  Listing 9-10.  billing tests test_api.py - Authenticating as an Admin in Our Test  from rest_framework.test import APITestCase from rest_framework.status import HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, HTTP_200_OK,  HTTP_201_CREATED from django.urls import reverse from model_bakery import baker  class TestBillingAPI APITestCase :    @classmethod    def setUpTestData cls :        cls.admin = baker.make "users.User", is_staff=True      def test_anon_cannot_list_clients self :        response = self.client.get reverse "billing:client-list"          self.assertEqual response.status_code, HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN   149   ChaPTer 9    TesTing in a DeCouPleD WorlD     def test_admin_can_list_clients self :        self.client.force_login self.admin         response = self.client.get reverse "billing:client-list"          self.assertEqual response.status_code, HTTP_200_OK      def test_anon_cannot_create_invoice self :        response = self.client.post             reverse "billing:invoice-create" , data={}, format="json"                 self.assertEqual response.status_code, HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN   With this test in place, we are now ready to test things out. In the terminal, run the   following command to switch Django to the testing environment:  export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=decoupled_dj.settings.testing  Then, run pytest:  pytest  If everything goes well, we should see the following output in the console:  billing tests test_api.py ... [100%] ============= 3 passed in 0.94s ==========  Our tests are passing! We can now add one last case to our test: as an admin user, I  can create a new invoice. To do so, we create a new method in the class. In this method,  we log in as admin and make a POST request to the API, by providing a request body.  Let’s not forget that, to create an invoice, we must also pass a list of item lines. This can  be done in the request body. The following listing shows the complete test method,  where we also create a user before the request body. This user is later associated with the  invoice, as shown in Listing 9-11.  Listing 9-11.  billing tests test_api.py - Testing Invoice Creation as an Admin  ... def test_admin_can_create_invoice self :    self.client.force_login self.admin     user = baker.make "users.User"     data = {  150   ChaPTer 9    TesTing in a DeCouPleD WorlD         "user": user.pk,        "date": "2021-03-15",i        "due_date": "2021-03-30",        "items": [            {                "quantity": 1,                "description": "Django consulting",                "price": 5000.00,                "taxed": True,            }        ],    }    response = self.client.post         reverse "billing:invoice-create" , data, format="json"         self.assertEqual response.status_code, HTTP_201_CREATED  ...  This concludes our unit test for the billing app REST API. Alongside a functional test,   we covered the whole spectrum of communication between the backend and frontend.  Note  it is a good moment to commit the changes you made so far and to  push the work to your git repo.

Additional Resource      Intercepting network requests with Cypress  152   CHAPTER 10  Authentication  and Authorization  in the Django REST  Framework  This chapter covers:     Token-based authentication and JWT in brief     Session-based authentication for single-page apps  Writing a technical book means starting with a billion topics to cover, and not   enough space to fit everything in.  Authentication is one of those huge topics that almost impossible to cover deeply  in a single chapter. There are simply too many scenarios: mobile applications, desktop  applications, and single-page apps. Since this book has been more about single-  page applications and JavaScript paired with Django, this chapter focuses only on  the interaction between these two actors. In the first part, we discuss token-based  authentication. In the second part, we resort to a battle-tested authentication flow,  paired with single-page applications.  Note  The rest of this chapter assumes you are in the repo root decoupled-dj,  with the Python virtual environment active and with DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE  configured as decoupled_dj.settings.development.    Valentino Gagliardi 2021  V. Gagliardi, Decoupled Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-7144-5_10  153   ChaPTer 10    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework   Introduction to Token-Based Authentication  and JWT In Chapter 6, we created a pseudo-decoupled Django project with the DRF and Vue.js.  In Chapter 7, we hardened the security of our project, by adding a minimal form   of authentication and authorization. We saw how to use session-based authentication  to protect our single-page application when it’s served from a Django view. In Chapter 8  we added Next.js to the mix. To generate a blog starting from our Django project, we  had to disable authentication altogether. This is far from optimal and leads us to think  also about all those situations where the frontend is completely decoupled from the  Django backend. In a traditional setup, it is possible to use cookies and session-based  authentication without much hassle. However, when the frontend and the backend are  on different domains, authentication becomes tricky. Also, since sessions are stored on  the server, the interchange of session cookies and CSRF cookies between the frontend  and the backend violates the stateless nature of REST. For this reason, over the years, the  community came up with a form of token-based authentication called JSON Web Token.  For authentication in decoupled setups, token-based authentication with JWT is  all the rage these days, especially in the JavaScript community. In Django, JWT is not  yet standardized into the core. What follows is an introduction to JWT, token-based  authentication, and a discussion of their potential pitfalls.   Token-Based Authentication: The Good and the Bad Token-based authentication is not a new concept by any means.  A token is a simple identifier that the frontend can exchange with the backend to   prove that it has the rights to read or write to the backend. In the simplest arrangement,  the decoupled frontend sends a username and password to the backend. On the other  side, the backend verifies the user’s credentials, and if they are valid, it sends a token  back to the frontend. The token is usually a simple alphanumeric string, such as the  following example:  9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b  When the frontend wants to make requests to a protected resource on the API, be  it a GET or a POST request, it has to send back this token by including it in the request  headers. The Django REST Framework has out-of-the-box support for token-based  authentication with the TokenAuthentication scheme.  154   ChaPTer 10    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework  In terms of security, this authentication mechanism is far from being bulletproof.   First off, sending the credentials over the wire, namely a username and password, is not  the best approach, even under HTTPS. Also, once we obtain a token in the frontend, we  need to persist it during the entire user session, and sometimes even beyond that. To  persist the token, most developers resort to saving it in localStorage, a huge mistake  which effectively opens the application to a whole new set of risks. localStorage is  vulnerable to XSS attacks, where an attacker injects malicious JavaScript code in a web  page it has control of, lures the user to visit it, and steals any non HttpOnly cookies, as  well as potentially any data saved in localStorage.  In terms of the capabilities of these tokens instead, they are very simple. They do not   carry info about the user, nor indications on what permissions the user has. They are  strictly tied to Django and to its database, and only Django can pair a given user with  its token. Their simplicity is a “feature” of these basic tokens. Despite these limitations,  token-based authentication works well in all those situations where the frontend is on a  different domain from the backend. However, over the years, the JavaScript community  has pondered about the opportunity to create more structured tokens. This led to the  creation of a new standard called JSON Web Tokens, which introduced innovations as  well as more challenges.   JSON Web Tokens in Django: Advantages and Challenges A JSON Web Token, or JWT for short, is a standard that defines a convenient way to  exchange authentication information between a client and a server.  JWT tokens are a completely different beast from a simple alphanumeric token. First   off, they are signed. That is, they are encrypted by the server before being sent off the  wire and are decrypted back on the client. This is necessary because JWT tokens contain  sensitive information that can be used to authenticate against protected resources if these  tokens are stolen. JWT has a solid market share in the JavaScript Node.js community.  On the Django scene instead, they are considered an insecure authentication   method. The reason for this is that server-side JWT implementations are hard to get  right, and there are simply too many things in the spec left open to interpretation for the  implementer, which can build an insecure JWT server without even knowing. To learn  more about all the security implications of JWT, check out the first link in the additional  resources. In brief, as of today, Django has no core support for JWT, and this situation is  not going to change in the future.  155   ChaPTer 10    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework  If you want to use JWT in your own Django projects, a number of libraries exist, like  django-rest-framework-simplejwt. This library does not handle the registration flow,  but only the issuing phase of JWT. In other words, from the frontend we can use   api token  and api token refresh  with the username and password to request a new  token or refresh a token if we have a token in hand. When a client requests a token from  the server, the server replies with two tokens: an access token and a refresh token. Access  tokens usually have an expiration date as a security measure. Refresh tokens, on the  other hand, are used by the client to request a new access token when the latter expires.  The access token is used for authentication, and the refresh token is used for requesting  a new authentication token. Since both tokens are equally important, they must be both  protected adequately on the client.  As with any token, JWT tokens are often subject to the same pitfalls. Most developers   persist JWT tokens in localStorage, which is vulnerable to XSS. This is possibly even  worse than persisting a simple alphanumeric token, as JWT carries much more sensitive  information in its body, and even if it’s encrypted, we can’t be lax about protecting it.  To avoid these risks, developers resort to saving JWT tokens in HttpOnly cookies, which  coincidentally sounds a lot like the most classic session-based authentication method. In  the end, even if JWT tokens are convenient for cross-domain and mobile authentication,  maintaining such an infrastructure can be hard and prone to security risks. Is there an  easy path to authentication with Django and single-page applications? we’ll explore that  question in the next sections.   Session-Based Auth for Single-Page Apps In the end, authentication for Django projects should not be complicated, at least for  web apps.  In fact, with the help of NGINX, we can use session-based authentication instead  of tokens, even for single-page apps. In Chapter 7 we deployed our Django app with a  traditional setup, which was a Django template serving a single-page application. What if  we turn things upside down now, by serving a single-page application as the main entry  point to our Django project? There are a few steps we need to think about before this can  happen. In particular, NGINX should:     Serve a single-page app from the root location block     Proxy API, auth, and admin requests to Django  156   ChaPTer 10    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework  To do this, we need to make the necessary adjustments to the configuration from   Chapter 7. Let’s see what needs to be done in the next sections.  Note  The configuration we are going to see is completely independent of the one  in Chapter 7. They are two different approaches, both valid.   Some Words on Production and Development The scenario provided in the following sections is not easily replicable on the local  workstation, unless you’re using Docker or a virtual machine.  To keep things as close as possible to reality, we present a production environment  where the application is deployed at https:  decoupled- django.com , with a valid SSL  certificate. If you want to replicate the same environment, you have two options:     Use Docker to run NGINX, Django, and Vue.js  not covered in this   book .     Use a virtual machine environment, such as VirtualBox, to create a   Linux machine and then run the Ansible playbook from https:   github.com valentinogagliardi decoupled- dj tree chapter_10_ authentication.  If you go with the second option, here are some tips:          In the VirtualBox instance, forward a port for SSH and another for the  web server, from the guest to the host. For SSH you can pick 8022 for  the guest, forwarded to 22 on the host, and for the web server, pick  port 80 forwarded from the guest to the host.  In the  etc hosts file of your main workstation, configure the  decoupled- django.com domain and the static.decoupled- django.com  subdomain to point to 127.0.0.1.  With the virtual machine in place, from your workstation, run the Ansible playbook   with the following command:  ansible-playbook -i deployment inventory deployment site.yml --extra-vars  "trustme=yes"  157   ChaPTer 10    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework  This playbook will configure the environment, deploy the code, and create a fake   SSL certificate for decoupled- django.com and static.decoupled- django.com. Once it’s  done, you can access https:  decoupled- django.com  in your browser, after adding an  exception for the certificates.  instructions on how to run the playbook can be found at https:    Note  github.com valentinogagliardi decoupled- dj blob chapter_10_ authentication README.mddeployment.   Preparing NGINX for the New Setup As a first step, we need to configure NGINX to serve our single-page application on the  root location block.  Listing 10-1 shows the first change.  Listing 10-1.  deployment templates decoupled-django.com.j2 - NGINX  Configuration to Serve the Single-Page Application  ... location   {    alias  home {{ user }} code billing vue_spa dist ; } ...  This is different from what we saw in Chapter 7, where the main entry point of the   project was Gunicorn. In this example, we reuse the Vue.js single-page app from Chapter 6,   which is a simple form for creating invoices, but to test things out, we promote it to the  main single-page app for our project. Here we say to NGINX, when a user visits the root  of our website, send it to the Vue.js app in  home decoupled-django code billing  vue_spa dist . What is dist here? By default, Vue CLI builds the production JS bundle  in the dist folder of the Vue.js project. This is the default configuration, but in Chapter 6   we changed it to emit the bundles where Django would expect them, in static files.  Now we go back to the default. To make this work, we also need to tweak Vue.js a bit  in a moment. With this configuration, by visiting https:  decoupled- django.com  in  production, NGINX will serve the single-page app. However, as soon as Vue.js loads,   158   ChaPTer 10    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework  it makes a call to billing api clients  to fetch a list of clients for the  . This  leads us to adjust the NGINX configuration again so that any request to  api  is proxied  to Gunicorn, and thus to Django. Listing 10-2 shows the additional NGINX block.  Listing 10-2.  deployment templates decoupled-django.com.j2 - NGINX  Configuration to Proxy API Requests to Django  location ~*  api  {    proxy_pass http:  gunicorn;    proxy_set_header Host $host;    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; }  With this change in place, API calls will actually reach Django. There’s still one detail   missing: authentication. Everything changes with this setup. Django is not in charge of  serving the single-page app anymore, but it should indeed serve the API and the login  flow, for a good reason—more on this in the next section.   Handling the Login Flow with Django We want to use a single-page application as the main entry point to our Django project,  but we also want to use session-based authentication from Django.  This is the point where we hit a conundrum. How do we authenticate our users  without involving tokens? Django has a built-in authentication system, part of the  contrib module, from which we can peruse a set of views for handling the most  common authentication flows: login logout, register confirm, and password reset. For  example, LoginView from django.contrib.auth.views can help with the login flow.  However, the problem with our current setup is that the single-page application is now  completely decoupled from the Django project.  As a naive approach, we could try to make a POST request to a Django LoginView   from JavaScript, but these views are protected with a CSRF check. This is the same  problem we hit before, but now it is more serious because we don’t have any Django  view from which we can grab the CSRF token before issuing the request. The solution?   159   ChaPTer 10    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework  We can let Django handle the authentication flow. To do so, we are going to create a  standalone Django application for the authentication logic. In the root project folder, run  the following command:  python manage.py startapp login  Listing 10-3 inside it.  Next, create a new URL configuration in login urls.py and place the code shown in   Listing 10-3.  login urls.py - URL Configuration for Login and Logout Views  from django.urls import path from django.contrib.auth.views import LoginView, LogoutView  app_name = "auth"  urlpatterns = [    path         "login ",        LoginView.as_view             template_name="login login.html",            redirect_authenticated_user=True         ,        name="login",     ,    path "logout ", LogoutView.as_view  , name="logout" , ]  Here we declare two routes, one for login and another for logout. The LoginView uses   a custom template_name. Create the template in login templates login login.html,  as shown in Listing 10-4.  Listing 10-4.  login templates login login.html - Login Form                 Login     160   ChaPTer 10    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework         {% csrf_token %}              Username:          <input type="text" name="username" autofocus maxlength="254"   required id="id_username">                    Password:          <input type="password" name="password" autocomplete="current-   password" required="" id="id_password">                        LOGIN        {{ form.non_field_errors }}      This is a simple HTML form augmented with Django template tags; specifically, it   includes {% csrf_token %}. When the form is rendered, Django places a hidden HTML  input in the markup, as shown in Listing 10-5.  Listing 10-5.  Django’s CSRF Token in HTML Forms  <input type="hidden" name="csrfmiddlewaretoken" value="2TYg60oC0GC2LW7oJEPw Bsg2ajZsjJ0n5Wvjqd28J9wMcGBanbnNfkmfT5Qw3juK">  The value of this input is sent alongside POST requests to Django LoginView. If the   user’s credentials are valid, Django redirects the user to a URL of choice, and sends two  cookies to the browser: csrftoken and sessionid. To make this work, we need to load  the login app and configure the redirect URL in decoupled_dj settings base.py, as  shown in Listing 10-6.  161   ChaPTer 10    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework  Listing 10-6.  decoupled_dj settings base.py - Enabling the Login App and  Configuring the Login Redirect URL  INSTALLED_APPS = [    ...    "login" ]  ...  LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = " "  Once this is done, include the new URLs in the root configuration, decoupled_dj   urls.py, as shown in Listing 10-7.  Listing 10-7.  decoupled_dj urls.py - Including the URL from the Login App  urlpatterns = [    ...    path "auth ", include "login.urls", namespace="auth"  , ]  As a last step, we tell NGINX that any request to  auth  must be proxied to Django,   as shown in Listing 10-8.  Listing 10-8.  deployment templates decoupled- django.com.j2 - NGINX  Configuration to Proxy Authentication Requests to Django  location  auth  {    proxy_pass http:  gunicorn;    proxy_set_header Host $host;    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; }  162   ChaPTer 10    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework  What do we achieve with this setup? NGINX now replies as follows:     Requests to https:  decoupled- django.com auth login  are   proxied to Gunicorn Django     Requests to https:  decoupled- django.com  are proxied to Vue.js     Requests to https:  decoupled- django.com billing api  are   proxied to Gunicorn Django  In this arrangement, Django handles the whole authentication flow with session-   based authentication. On the other hand, the single-page application merely makes API  calls to Django. In this regard, we need to fix Vue.js to work with the new setup.  Note  You can find the source code for the nginX configuration at https:   github.com valentinogagliardi decoupled- dj tree chapter_10_ authentication deployment templates .   Preparing the Vue.js App for the New Setup To recap, in Chapter 6 we configured vue.config.js and .env.staging to make Django  static files work with Vue.js.  In Chapter 7 we added another piece to the puzzle, by configuring .env.production  so that Vue.js could recognize the subdomain from where it was loaded. In this chapter,  we can get rid of those configurations. The configuration files vue.config.js, .env. staging, and .env.production can be removed from billing vue_spa . By doing so,  when building the production bundle, the JavaScript files and assets will land in the  dist folder. This folder is usually excluded from the source control, so we need to install  Node.js on the target machine to install JavaScript dependencies and build the bundle  from  home decoupled-django code billing vue_spa. Once this is done, we can run  our Vue.js app as the main entry point to the Django project.  Note  The ansible playbook at https:  github.com valentinogagliardi  decoupled- dj tree chapter_10_authentication takes care of installing  node.js and building the bundle.  163   ChaPTer 10    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework  The effect of this setup is that the JavaScript frontend will pass cookies to Django   without any intervention from us. Figure 10-1 shows csrftoken and sessionid travelling  with the GET request to  billing api clients.  Figure 10-1.  GET requests from JavaScript to Django include the session cookie  and the CSRF token  Figure 10-2 shows the same cookies, this time transmitted with a POST request.  164   ChaPTer 10    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework  Figure 10-2.  POST requests from JavaScript to Django include the session cookie  and the CSRF token  There isn’t anything magical in this setup: cookies can travel on the same origin,   even over Fetch.   A Note About HttpOnly Cookies An HttpOnly cookie is a cookie that can’t be read from JavaScript code.  By default, Django already ensures that sessionid has the HttpOnly attribute. This   doesn’t break cookie exchange with fetch because the same-origin default behavior  ensures that cookies are sent back and forth when the calling JavaScript code has the  same origin of the targeted URL. As for csrftoken, we need to leave it accessible to  JavaScript because we include it as a header alongside non-safe HTTP requests  POST  and the like .  165    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework  ChaPTer 10   Handling Authentication in the Frontend Now that we configured NGINX to proxy our requests to the appropriate destination,  and now that the Django backend is ready to handle login requests, we can handle  authentication in the frontend.  The good news is that we won’t write authentication forms by hand, send out tokens,  or save them in localStorage. However, we need to find a way around HttpOnly cookies,  since we can’t access sessionid from JavaScript anymore. It is a common practice  to check if the user is authenticated from JavaScript code by looking at cookies. With  sessionid as a HttpOnly cookie, we don’t have this luxury  and relaxing this protection  is not an option . A possible solution hides in the error messages coming from our  REST API. Any unauthenticated request to the DRF in fact returns Authentication  credentials were not provided, along with a 403 Forbidden error. In the frontend,  we can check for this signal, and then redirect the user to  auth login . Let’s open  billing vue_spa src App.vue. This is the root component of our Vue.js application. In  this component we can check whether the user is authenticated before redirecting it to  the login view. To start, in the template section, we render InvoiceCreate only if the user  is authenticated by checking a Boolean in the component’s state. Listing 10-9 shows the  changes in the   section.  Listing 10-9.  billing vue_spa src App.vue - Checking if the User Is Logged In                                    In the script section of the component, we assemble the following logic:  In mounted  , we make a call to an endpoint  If we get a 200, we consider the user authenticated  If we get a Forbidden, we jump to check the exact type of error from  the Django REST Framework              166   ChaPTer 10    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework  Listing 10-10 shows the changes in the   section.  Listing 10-10.  billing vue_spa src App.vue - Handling Authentication in the  Frontend                                      import InvoiceCreate from "@ components InvoiceCreate";  export default {  name: "App",  components: {    InvoiceCreate  },  data: function   {    return {      isLoggedIn: false    };  },  methods: {    redirectToLogin: function   {      this.isLoggedIn = false;      window.location.href = " auth login ";    }  },  mounted   {    fetch " billing api clients "       .then response => {  167   ChaPTer 10    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework         if            !response.ok &&          response.statusText === "Forbidden"          {          return response.json  ;        }        this.isLoggedIn = true;      }       .then drfError => {        switch  drfError?.detail  {          case "Authentication credentials were not provided.":            this.redirectToLogin  ;            break;          default:            break;        }      } ;  } };    In this code, we make an AJAX request to an endpoint of choice. If the request   returns a Forbidden, we check what kind of error the Django REST Framework gives  us, with a simple switch statement. The first error message we may want to check for  is Authentication credentials were not provided. This is a clear sign that we are  trying to access a protected resource without credentials. If you are worried that checking  authentication or permissions by the means of strings will look hacky because Django  could sooner or later change the error message and return an unexpected string, in  my experience there is always some kind of contract between frontend and backend  developers to agree on which response bodies or error messages they can expect from  each other. If strings are a concern, these can be easily abstracted away into constants. Not  counting that the frontend and the backend must always be put under a strong test suite.  168   ChaPTer 10    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework  in this example, we use fetch   to avoid pulling in additional   Note  dependencies. another valid alternative is axios, which has a convenient  interceptor feature.  With this logic in place, we can add more checks, such as permissions, as we will see   in the next section. This isn’t the most clever implementation, but it gets the job done,  and more important, it uses a battle-tested authentication method. The same approach  can also be used with React: we can serve the single-page application from NGINX, with  Django lurking in the background. It is important to note that this setup works only when  Django and the single-page are served under the same domain. This is easily achievable  with NGINX and Docker. For all those configurations where the client lives on a different  domain instead, token-based authentication is required. With the authentication part in  place, let’s now explore authorization in the Django REST Framework.  Note  in the previous example, we used window.location to redirect the user.  if you use Vue router, the code must be adjusted to use this.$router.push  .   Authorization and Permissions in the Django REST  Framework Once a user logs in, we are in the middle of the flow.  Authentication is the “who are you” part of the whole story. Next comes the “what   can you do” part. In Chapter 7, we locked down our API by allowing access only to admin  users. Listing 10-11 shows the configuration applied in decoupled_dj settings base.py.  Listing 10-11.  decoupled_dj setting base.py - Adding Permissions Globally in  the DRF  REST_FRAMEWORK = {    "DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES": [        "rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication",    ],  169   ChaPTer 10    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework     "DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES": [        "rest_framework.permissions.IsAdminUser"    ], }  To test things in the frontend, we can create an unprivileged user in our Django   project. Open a Django shell and run the following ORM instruction:  User.objects.create_user username="regular-user", password="insecure-pass"   This will create a new user in the database. If we try to log in with this user on auth  login , Django will redirect back to the homepage as expected, but once we land there,  we won’t see anything in the interface. This is because our JavaScript frontend isn’t  wired to handle the case where the Django REST Framework responds with You do not  have permission to perform this action. We can see this error in the Network tab  of the browser’s console for the call to billing api clients. With DRF permissions, we  can give users access to REST views. Permissions can be not only set at the configuration  level, but also with granularity on each view. To permit access to authenticated users, not  only to admin on billing api clients, we can use the IsAuthenticated permission  class. To apply this permission, open billing api views.py and adjust the code as  shown in Listing 10-12.  Listing 10-12.  billing api views.py - Applying Permissions on the View Level  ... from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated  class ClientList ListAPIView :    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]     serializer_class = UserSerializer    queryset = User.objects.all   ...  With this change, any authenticated user can access the view. In the frontend, we   can handle permissions errors by adding another check in the switch statement, which  looks for You do not have permission to perform this action in the response from  the API and shows a user-friendly message to our users. Of course, the permission story   170   ChaPTer 10    auThenTiCaTion and auThorizaTion in The django reST Framework  does not stop here. In the Django REST Framework, we can customize permissions,  grant permissions on the object level, and much more. The documentation covers  almost every possible use case.  Note  it is a good moment to commit the changes you made so far and to  push the work to your git repo.

Summary You learned some important key takeaways from this chapter:     Never store tokens or other sensitive data in localStorage     Whenever possible, use session-based authentication to secure   single-page apps  In the next chapter, we begin our exploration of GraphQL in Django with Ariadne.   Additional Resource      JWTs in Django  171   CHAPTER 11  GraphQL in Django  with Ariadne  This chapter covers:     GraphQL schema, operations, and resolvers     Ariadne in Django     React and Django with GraphQL  In the first part of this chapter, we augment the billing app from Chapter 6 with a   GraphQL API. Later, we begin to connect a React TypeScript frontend to the GraphQL  backend.  Note  This chapter assumes you are in the repo root decoupled-dj, with  the Python virtual environment active and with DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE  configured as decoupled_dj.settings.development.   Getting Started with Ariadne in Django Chapter 1 covered the fundamentals of GraphQL.  We learned that in order to get data from a GraphQL API, we send a query over a   POST request. To change data on the database instead, we send a so-called mutation. It’s  now time to put the theory in practice by introducing GraphQL into our Django project  with Ariadne, a GraphQL library for Python. Ariadne uses a schema-first approach.  In schema-first, the GraphQL API gets shaped with the GraphQL Schema Definition  Language, in the form of a string or a .graphql file.    Valentino Gagliardi 2021  V. Gagliardi, Decoupled Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-7144-5_11  173    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  ChaPTer 11   Installing Ariadne To start off, we install Ariadne in the Django project:  pip install ariadne  After the installation, we update requirements base.txt to include the new   dependency. Next, we enable Ariadne in decoupled_dj settings base.py, as shown in  Listing 11-1.  Listing 11-1.  decoupled_dj settings base.py - Enabling Ariadne in   INSTALLED_APPS  We also need to make sure that APP_DIRS in TEMPLATES is set to True, as shown in   Listing 11-2.  Listing 11-2.  decoupled_dj settings base.py - Template Configuration  INSTALLED_APPS = [       ...       "ariadne.contrib.django", ]  TEMPLATES = [       {       ...       "APP_DIRS": True,       ... ]  That’s all we need to do to get started. After enabling Ariadne, we are now ready to   start building our GraphQL schema.   Designing the GraphQL Schema GraphQL enforces the Schema Definition Language to define a schema, which is the  principal building block for the GraphQL API.  174   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  This is a large departure from REST where the backend code usually comes first, and   only later we generate documentation for the API. This concept in GraphQL is turned  upside down: we create the schema first, which acts both as a documentation and as  a contract between the GraphQL API and its consumers. Without a schema we cannot  send queries or mutations to the GraphQL API: we would get an error, because the  schema drives exactly what the consumer can ask the service. What’s in a schema? The  GraphQL schema contains a definition of all the operations and model entities available  for consumers. Before thinking about our schema, let’s recap the entities involved in our  billing app. We have the following endpoints:   billing api clients    billing api invoices   Plus, we have the following models:  User                      Invoice, connected with a foreign key to User  ItemLine, connected with a foreign key to Invoice  Our GraphQL schema must contain the shape of all these models  as long as we   want to expose them in the API , plus the shape of each permitted GraphQL operation,  with their return values. What does this mean in practice? In order to send a getClients  query to the GraphQL API, we first need to define its shape in the schema. Take for  example the query in Listing 11-3.  Listing 11-3.  Example of a Typical GraphQL Query  query {   getClients {       name   } }  Without the corresponding schema, the query would fail with the following error:  Cannot query field 'getClients' on type 'Query'  All the queries, mutations, and subscriptions available in the GraphQL schema go   under the name of operations.  175   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  With this knowledge, let’s define our first schema. Create a new file at billing   schema.graphql. Notice it has a .graphql extension. Most editors and IDEs offer  completion and IntelliSense for the language, thus it makes sense to have the schema in  its own file. As an alternative we could also write the schema directly as a triple-quoted  string in the code. In this example, we take the first approach. In the schema we are  going to define all the entities for the billing app, plus a first query for getting all clients  from the database. Where do we get the shape of our objects? Since our app already has  a REST API with the DRF, we can look at billing api serializers.py to see what fields  are exposed there. After all, DRF serializers are the public interface between Django  models and the rest of the world, and so it’s the GraphQL schema in its own way. Also,  we should look in billing models.py to see how our models are connected, in order to  express the same relationships in GraphQL. Listing 11-4 shows our first schema based  on our models and on the appropriate fields defined in DRF serializers.  Listing 11-4.  billing schema.graphql - First Iteration of the GraphQL Schema for  the Billing App  enum InvoiceState {    PAID    UNPAID    CANCELLED }  type User {    id: ID    name: String    email: String }  type Invoice {    user: User    date: String    dueDate: String    state: InvoiceState    items: [ItemLine] }  type ItemLine {  176   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne     quantity: Int    description: String    price: Float    taxed: Boolean }  type Query {    getClients: [User] }  From the schema we can immediately recognize GraphQL scalar types: ID, String,  Boolean, Int, and Float. These types describe what type of data each field of the object  has. We can also notice an enum type, which represents the different states of an Invoice.  In our serializer we didn’t expose the state field for an Invoice, but it is a good time  to include it in the GraphQL schema. As for the model entities in our database, notice  User, Invoice, and ItemLine as custom objects types with fields. Another thing that  stands out is the way in which model relationships are described. From top to bottom,  we can see that:          Invoice as a user field to a User  Invoice as an items field to a list of ItemLines     The getClients query resolves  returns  a list of Users  Really, the schema is expressiveness at its finest. It’s also worth noting that this   schema isn’t perfect yet, for many reasons. For example, Invoice has date and dueDate  represented as String. This is not what Django expects. We will fix these inconsistencies  later. Eager to see what a GraphQL API looks like in Django, in the next section we load  the schema in Ariadne.   Loading the Schema in Ariadne We are a couple of steps away from setting up our first GraphQL endpoint in Django.  To do so, we need to load the schema and make it executable. Create another file at   billing schema.py, which should contain the code in Listing 11-5.  177   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  Listing 11-5.  billing schema.py - Loading the Schema in Ariadne  from ariadne import load_schema_from_path, gql, make_executable_schema from ariadne import ObjectType from pathlib import Path  BASE_DIR = Path __file__ .resolve  .parent  schema_file = load_schema_from_path BASE_DIR   "schema.graphql"  type_defs = gql schema_file   query = ObjectType "Query"   """ TODO: Write resolvers """  schema = make_executable_schema type_defs, query   In this snippet, we import the necessary tools from Ariadne. In particular:  load_schema_from_path loads our schema file from the filesystem  gql validates the schema  ObjectType creates root types  Query, Mutation, and Subscription   make_executable_schema connects the schema to resolvers, Python  functions that execute queries against the database                  In this first snippet we don’t have any resolver yet. We will add some in the next   sections. It’s also important to note that this code does not do anything on the database  yet. In the next section, we wire up billing schema.py to a Django URL.   Wiring Up the GraphQL Endpoint Before making queries to the GraphQL API, we need to connect our schema to a Django  URL.  To do so, we add an URL named graphql  in billing urls.py, as shown in   Listing 11-6.  178   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  Listing 11-6.  billing urls.py - Enabling the GraphQL Endpoint  from django.urls import path from .views import Index from .api.views import ClientList, InvoiceCreate from ariadne.contrib.django.views import GraphQLView from .schema import schema  app_name = "billing"  urlpatterns = [    path "", Index.as_view  , name="index" ,    path "api clients ", ClientList.as_view  , name="client-list" ,    path "api invoices ", InvoiceCreate.as_view  , name="invoice-create" ,    path "graphql ", GraphQLView.as_view schema=schema , name="graphql" , ]  In this URL configuration for Django, we import GraphQLView from Ariadne, which  works much like a regular CBV. After saving the file and starting the Django project with  python manage.py runserver, we can head over to http:  127.0.0.1:8000 billing  graphql . This should open the GraphQL Playground, an interactive tool for exploring  the GraphQL API. In the playground we can send out queries, mutations, or just explore  the schema and the integrated documentation. Figure 11-1 shows the schema we  created before as it appears on the GraphQL Playground.  179   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  Figure 11-1.  The GraphQL Playground for Ariadne. It exposes the schema and a  convenient documentation  Figure 11-2 instead shows the auto-generated documentation for our first query.  180   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  Figure 11-2.  Our first query appears in the auto-generated documentation  To send queries to this GraphQL endpoint, we can use the playground or more   realistically a JavaScript client. For a quick test, you can also use curl. Open another  terminal and launch the following command:  curl -X POST --location "http:  127.0.0.1:8000 billing graphql " \       -H "Accept: application json" \       -H "Content-Type: application json" \       -d "{       \"query\": \"query { getClients { name } }\"       }"  In response, you should get the following result:  {"data": {"getClients": null } }  This is a sign that our GraphQL API is working, but nothing gets returned from our   query. Time to meet resolvers in the next section.  181    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  ChaPTer 11   Working with Resolvers What’s a resolver in GraphQL? In its simplest form, a resolver is a callable  a method or a  function  in charge of querying a database or any other source. Resolvers in GraphQL are  the bridge between the public API and the database, and this is also the hardest part of the  equation. GraphQL is simply a spec, and most implementations do not include a database  layer. Luckily, Django has a great ORM to ease the burden of working directly with raw  SQL queries. Let’s revisit our schema, specifically the query shown in Listing 11-7.  Listing 11-7.  Our First Query  type Query {       getClients: [User] }  This query has a field called getClients. In order to get our getClients query   working, we need to bind this query field to a resolver. To do so, we go back to billing  schema.py where we add a first resolver, as in Listing 11-8.  Listing 11-8.  billing schema.py - Adding a Resolver to the Mix  from ariadne import load_schema_from_path, gql, make_executable_schema from ariadne import ObjectType from pathlib import Path from users.models import User  BASE_DIR = Path __file__ .resolve  .parent  schema_file = load_schema_from_path BASE_DIR   "schema.graphql"  type_defs = gql schema_file   query = ObjectType "Query"   @query.field "getClients"  def resolve_clients obj, info :    return User.objects.all    schema = make_executable_schema type_defs, query   182   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  The most notable change in this file is that we import the User model, and we   decorate a resolver function with @query.field  . In the example, the resolver resolve_ clients   gets two parameters: obj and info. info contains details about the requested  field, and more important, it carries a context object that has the HTTP request attached.  This is an instance of WSGIRequest for a Django project running synchronously. obj  is any value returned from a parent resolver, since resolvers can also be nested. In our  example we don’t use these parameters for now. Once we save the file, we can include as  many fields as we want in our query for each single user. For example, we can send the  query in Listing 11-9 in the GraphQL Playground.  Listing 11-9.  A GraphQL Query for Fetching All Clients  query {   getClients {       id       name       email   } }  Notice that in the Python code for Ariadne, we didn’t define resolvers for id, name, or  email. We simply defined a resolver for the getClients query. It would be impractical to  define by hand a resolver for each field, and luckily, GraphQL has us covered. Ariadne can  handle these fields with the concept of default resolvers, taken from graphql-core, which  Ariadne builds upon. Our query will now return the response shown in Listing 11-10.  Listing 11-10.  The Response from the GraphQL API  {     "data": {         "getClients": [             {                 "id": "1",                 "name": "Juliana",                 "email": "juliana@acme.io"             },  183   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne              {                 "id": "2",                 "name": "John",                 "email": "john@zyx.dev"             }         ]     } }  If you don’t have a user in the database yet, create some from the shell:  python manage.py shell_plus  To create two users, run the following queries  >>> is the shell prompt :  >>> User.objects.create_user username="jul81", name="Juliana",  email="juliana@acme.io"  >>> User.objects.create_user username="john89", name="John",   email="john@zyx.dev"   Note  So far we talked about databases, but GraphQL can work with almost any  data source. Gatsby is a great example of this capability: the Markdown plugin for  example can resolve data from .md files.  Congratulations on creating your first GraphQL endpoint! Let’s now learn about   query arguments in GraphQL.   Using Query Arguments in GraphQL So far we fetched all the users from the database.  What if we want to fetch just one? This is where query arguments come into play.   Let’s imagine the following GraphQL query:  184   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  query {  getClient id: 2  {    name    email  } }  Here we have a query field, used much like a function. id is the argument for the   “function”. In the body instead, we declare the fields we want to fetch for the single user.  To support this query, the schema must know about it. This means we need to:     Define the new query field in the schema     Create a resolver to fulfill the field  First off, in billing schema.graphql, we add the new field to the existing Query   object, as shown in Listing 11-11  all the existing object types must be left intact .  Listing 11-11.  billing schema.graphql - Adding a New Field to the Query  type Query {    getClients: [User]    getClient id: ID! : User }  In the new getClient field, notice the id parameter with its scalar type ID, which is   now followed by an exclamation mark. This symbol means that the parameter is non-  nullable: we cannot query with a null ID, for obvious reasons.  Note  The non-nullable constraint can be applied to any GraphQL object   field or list.  With the schema in good shape, we now proceed to define the new resolver in  billing schema.py, as shown in Listing 11-12  for brevity, we show just the new  resolver .  185   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  Listing 11-12.  billing schema.py - An Additional Resolver for Fulfilling the New  Query  ... @query.field "getClient"  def resolve_client obj, info, id :    return User.objects.get id=id  ...  In this new resolver, alongside obj and info, we can also see a third parameter  named id. This parameter will be passed by our GraphQL query to the resolver. In  general, any number of parameters defined in the query are passed down to the  corresponding resolver. We can now issue the query shown in Listing 11-13 in the  playground.  Listing 11-13.  Retrieving a Single User from the GraphQL Playground  The server should return the response shown in Listing 11-14.  Listing 11-14.  The GraphQL Response for a Single User  query {  getClient id: 2  {    name    email  } }  {  "data": {    "getClient": {      "name": "John",      "email": "john@zyx.dev"    }  } }  data with a mutation.  186  After this tour of data fetching, it’s now time to do something more challenging: add    ChaPTer 11   A Word on Schema-First vs Code-First We can already spot a pattern after adding a couple of queries and resolvers to our  GraphQL API.    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  Every time we need a new field, we update two files:          billing schema.graphql  billing schema.py  A solution to this problem consists in co-locating the textual schema right inside the   code. Consider the following example:  type_defs = gql     """    type User {        id: ID        name: String        email: String    }    """    Instead of loading the schema from the file, we place it directly in gql. This is a   convenient approach. However, the ability to derive and generate the schema starting  from the code, with a code-first approach, turns out to be even more flexible than  dealing with strings. Graphene and Strawberry follow this path exactly.   Implementing Mutations Mutations in GraphQL are side effects, that is, operations meant to change the state of  the database.  In Chapter 6, we worked on a REST backend, which accepted POST requests from the   frontend to create new invoices. To create a new invoice, our backend wanted:     The user ID to associate to the invoice     The invoice date     The invoice due date     One or more item lines  an array  to associate to the invoice  187   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  To implement the same logic in GraphQL we must think in terms of mutations. A   mutation has the following traits:          It’s not a query  It takes arguments  We already saw how a GraphQL query with arguments looks. A mutation is not so   different. With the requirements for creating a new invoice in mind, we want to be able  to craft the mutation shown in Listing 11-15.  Listing 11-15.  The Mutation Request for Creating a New Invoice  mutation {  invoiceCreate invoice: {    user: 1    date: "2021-02-15"    dueDate: "2021-02-15"    state: PAID    items: [{      quantity: 1      description: "Django backend"      price: 6000.00      taxed: false    },    {      quantity: 1      description: "React frontend"      price: 8000.00      taxed: false    }]  }  {    user { id }    date    state  } }  188   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  We can see from the invoice argument that the payload is not a simple scalar   anymore, but a complex object. Such an input object is known as input type, that is, a  strongly typed argument. We could pass these arguments separately in the signature of  the mutation, but better, we can leverage GraphQL type system to define the shape of  a single object as an argument. As a return value from this query, we ask the server to  respond with the following data:     The user ID connected to the new invoice     The date and the state of the invoice  The process of adding a mutation in GraphQL is not dissimilar from adding queries:     First we define the mutation and its inputs in the schema     Then we create a resolver to handle the side effect  In GraphQL, mutations are declared under the Mutation type. To create our first   mutation, add the code in Listing 11-16 to billing schema.graphql.  Listing 11-16.  billing schema.graphql - The Mutation for Creating a New Invoice  type Mutation {    invoiceCreate invoice: InvoiceInput! : Invoice! }  The invoiceCreate mutation takes an argument named invoice, of type   InvoiceInput, non-nullable. In exchange, it returns a non-nullable Invoice. We now  need to define input types. What they should look like? First of all, they should contain all  the required fields for creating an invoice. Let’s also not forget that item lines are an array  of items. In billing schema.graphql, we create two input types, as in Listing 11- 17.  Listing 11-17.  billing schema.graphql - Input Types for the Mutation  input ItemLineInput {    quantity: Int!    description: String!    price: Float!    taxed: Boolean! }  189   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  input InvoiceInput {    user: ID!    date: String!    dueDate: String!    state: InvoiceState    items: [ItemLineInput!]! }  type Mutation {    invoiceCreate invoice: InvoiceInput! : Invoice! }  We now have:  InvoiceInput: The input type used as the argument type for the  mutation. It has an items array of ItemLineInput.  ItemLineInput: The input type that represents a single item, as an  input type.  These input types will be reflected in the schema and in the documentation. With   the schema in place, we can now wire up the corresponding resolver.  Note  after making changes to billing schema.graphql, you should restart  Django development server, otherwise the changes won’t be picked up.   Adding a Resolver for the Mutation With the definition of the mutation in place, we can now add the corresponding resolver.  This resolver will touch the database to save a new invoice. To make this work, we   need to introduce a bit more code in our schema, specifically:  MutationType: To create a Mutation root type  Invoice and ItemLine: The Django models  Listing 11-18 shows the changes we need to make in billing schema.py.                  190   Listing 11-18.  billing schema.py - Adding a Resolver to Fulfill the Mutation  ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  ... from ariadne import ObjectType, MutationType ... from billing.models import Invoice, ItemLine ... mutation = MutationType    @mutation.field "invoiceCreate"  def resolve_invoice_create obj, info, invoice :    user_id = invoice.pop "user"     items = invoice.pop "items"      invoice = Invoice.objects.create user_id=user_id, **invoice     for item in items:        ItemLine.objects.create invoice=invoice, **item     return invoice  schema = make_executable_schema type_defs, query, mutation   A lot is going on in this code. Let’s break it down:     We use MutationType   to create a new mutation root type in   Ariadne  in the schema     We decorate the mutation resolver so that it maps to the field defined       In the resolver, we create a new invoice with the ORM     We bind the mutation to the schema  Django wants an instance of the user to create a new invoice, but all we have from   the GraphQL request is the ID of the user. This is why we remove user from the payload  to pass it as user_id to Invoice.objects.create  . As for the next steps, the logic  resembles what we did in Chapter 5 in the serializer. With this additional code in place,  we can now send the mutation shown in Listing 11-19 to GraphQL.  191   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  Listing 11-19.  The Mutation Request for Creating a New Invoice  mutation {  invoiceCreate invoice: {    user: 1    date: "2021-02-15"    dueDate: "2021-02-15"    state: PAID    items: [{      quantity: 1      description: "Django backend"      price: 6000.00      taxed: false    },    {      quantity: 1      description: "React frontend"      price: 8000.00      taxed: false    }]  }  {    user { id }    date    state  } }  Send out the mutation in the GraphQL Playground and you should see the following   Invoice   got an unexpected keyword argument 'dueDate'  This comes from the ORM layer of Django. In our mutation, we are sending out a  field named dueDate, which is by convention in the GraphQL JS world in camel case.  However, Django expects due_date, as it’s defined in the model. To fix this mismatch we  can use convert_kwargs_to_snake_case from Ariadne. Open billing schema.py and  apply the change shown in Listing 11-20.  error:  192   Listing 11-20.  billing schema.py - Converting from Camel Case to Snake Case  ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  ... from ariadne.utils import convert_kwargs_to_snake_case ...  ... @mutation.field "invoiceCreate"  @convert_kwargs_to_snake_case def resolve_invoice_create obj, info, invoice : ...  Here, we decorate our mutation resolver with the converter utility. If everything is in   the right spot, the server should now return the following response:  {  "data": {    "invoiceCreate": {      "user": {        "id": "1",        "email": "juliana@acme.io"      },      "date": "2021-02-15",      "state": "PAID"    }  } }  With the query and the mutation in place, we are now ready to connect a React   frontend to our GraphQL backend. But first, a word about GraphQL clients.   Introduction to GraphQL Clients We saw that as far the network layer is concerned, GraphQL does not seem to require  arcane tooling.  The conversation between a GraphQL client and its server happens over HTTP,  with POST requests. We could even call a GraphQL service with curl. This means, in  the browser we can use fetch, axios, or even XMLHttpRequest to make requests against   193   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  a GraphQL API. In reality, this could work well for tiny apps, but sooner or later, in the  real-world we need more than fetch. Specifically, for almost every data-fetching layer,  we need to take into account some kind of caching. Thanks to the way GraphQL works,  we can request only a subset of the data, but this does not rule out the need for sparing  round trips to the server. In the next sections we work with one of the most popular  GraphQL clients for JavaScript: Apollo Client. This tool abstracts away all the mundane  details of performance optimization for developers working with GraphQL in the  frontend.   Building the React Frontend In Chapter 6, we built a Vue.js app for creating invoices.  The app has a  , which in turn contains a   and a number of fields  for inserting invoice details. For this React app, we build the same structure, this time  splitting each sub-component in its own file. In this chapter, we work with the query  part. In Chapter 12, we see how to work with mutations. To start off we initialize a React  project. We move to the billing folder, and we launch create-react-app. To create the  React project, run the following command:  npx create-react-app react_spa --template typescript  This will create the project in billing react_spa. Once the project is in place, in a   new terminal move into the folder:  From this folder we will start the React application as soon as the GraphQL layer is in   Note  For the react part, we work in decoupled_dj billing react_spa.  each proposed file must be created or change in the appropriate subfolder, starting  from this path.  cd react_spa  place.  194   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne   Getting Started with Apollo Client To start off, we need to install Apollo Client in our project.  To do so, run the following command:  npm i @apollo client  Once the installation is done, open src App.tsx, wipe out all the boilerplate, and   populate the file with the code shown in Listing 11-21.  Listing 11-21.  src App.tsx - Initializing Apollo Client  import {  ApolloClient,  InMemoryCache,  gql, } from "@apollo client";  const client = new ApolloClient {  uri: "http:  127.0.0.1:8000 billing graphql ",  cache: new InMemoryCache  , } ;  Here we initialize the client by providing the URL of our GraphQL service. The   ApolloClient constructor takes at least these two options:  Here we use InMemoryCache, which is the default caching package included in Apollo   Client. Once we have a client instance, to send requests to the server, we can use:                  uri: The GraphQL service address  cache: The caching strategy for the client  client.query   to send queries  client.mutate   to send mutations  For the usage with React, Apollo offers also a set of convenient hooks. In the   next sections we create three React components, and we see how to work with client  methods, and later with hooks.  195    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  ChaPTer 11   Creating a Select Component The   is part of our form, and will receive props from the outside. It should  render an   element for each user in the database. In src Select.tsx, we create  the component shown in Listing 11-22.  Listing 11-22.  src Select.tsx - Select Component with TypeScript Definitions  import React from "react";  type Props = {  id: string;  name: string;  options: Array<{    id: string;    email: string;  }>; };  const Select =  { id, name, options }: Props  => {  return              ---       {options.map  option  => {        return             {option.email}          ;      } }        ; };  export default Select;  This component accepts from the outside a list of options to render out to the user.  Before adding GraphQL, in Vue.js we were fetching this data from the REST API. In this  app instead, we let a root component handle the data fetching, this time from a GraphQL  service, and pass the data to the  . Let’s now build the form.  196   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne   Creating a Form Component The form component is rather simple, as it accepts a function for handling the submit  event, alongside one or more children. In src Form.tsx, we create the component  shown in Listing 11-23.  Listing 11-23.  src Form.tsx - Form Component with TypeScript Definitions  import React from "react";  type Props = {  children: React.ReactNode;  handleSubmit     event: React.FormEvent    : void; };  const Form =  { children, handleSubmit }: Props  => {  return  {children} ; };  export default Form;  that will contain both.  With the   and the   in place, we can now wire up the root component    Creating the Root Component and Making Queries Each React app must have a root component, which in charge of rendering the shell of  the whole app. To keep things simple, we will create the root component in src App.tsx.  In our root component, we need to:     Query the GraphQL service for a list of clients, with a query     Handle the submit event, with a mutation  197   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  The idea here is that when the app mounts, we use useEffect   to query the   GraphQL API with client.query  . In the GraphQL Playground, we used the following  query to get a list of clients:  query {  getClients {    id    email  } }  In our React component we will use the same query to fetch clients. This is also the   source of data for our  . The only thing to keep in mind when assembling the  query is that this is an anonymous query, while in our React component we need to use  a slightly different form, as a named query. Let’s create the component in src App.tsx,  as in Listing 11-24.

First, the query is shown in Listing 11- 25.  Listing 11-25.  Building the Query  ...  const GET_CLIENTS = gql`    query getClients {      getClients {        id        email      }    }  `; ...  Here we use gql to wrap the query in a template literal tag. This will generate a   GraphQL Abstract syntax tree, which is used by the actual GraphQL client. Next up, let’s  examine the logic for sending the query:  ...    client      .query {        query: GET_CLIENTS,      }       .then  queryResult  => {        setOptions queryResult.data.getClients ;      }   200   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne       .catch  error  => {        console.log error ;      } ; ...  In this logic, we call client.query   by providing an object with a query property,   which gets assigned the previous query. client.query   returns a promise. This means  we can use then   to consume the result, and catch   to handle errors. Inside then    we access the query result, and we use setOptions from the component state to save  the result. The query result is accessible on data.getClients, which happens to be the  name of our query. This looks a bit verbose. In fact, Apollo offers a useQuery   hook to  reduce the boilerplate, as we will see in a moment. With everything saved, to test things  out we should run Django, as usual in a terminal from decoupled-dj:  python manage.py runserver  npm start  In the other terminal, from  billing react_spa we can run the React app:  This will launch React at http:  localhost:3000 . In the UI, we should be able to  see a select element, where each option renders the ID and the email of each client, as  in Figure 11-3.  201   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  Figure 11-3.  The select component receives data from the GraphQL API  This might not look like a tremendous achievement, not so different from fetching   data with axios or fetch. In the next section, we see how to clean up the logic with Apollo  Hooks for React.   Using Apollo Hooks for React Apollo Client does not discourage the use of client.query  .  However, in React applications, developers might want to use Apollo Hooks to keep   the codebase consistent, much like we are accustomed to reaching for useState    and useEffect   in our components. Apollo Client includes a set of hooks that make   202   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  working with GraphQL a breeze in React. To make queries, we can use the useQuery    hook instead of client.query  . However, this needs a bit of rearrangement in our  application. First off, we need to wrap the whole app with ApolloProvider. For those  familiar with Redux or the React Context API, this is the same concept exposed by Redux  Provider or by the React Context counterpart. In our app, we first need to move Apollo  Client instantiation in src index.tsx. In this same file, we also wrap the whole app with  the provider. Listing 11-26 illustrates the changes we need to make.  Listing 11-26.  src index.tsx - The App Shell  import React from "react"; import ReactDOM from "react-dom"; import {  ApolloClient,  InMemoryCache,  ApolloProvider, } from "@apollo client"; import App from ". App";  const client = new ApolloClient {  uri: "http:  127.0.0.1:8000 billing graphql ",  cache: new InMemoryCache  , } ;  ReactDOM.render                        ,  document.getElementById "root"   ;  Now, in src App.tsx we import only gql and useQuery from Apollo Client, plus we   arrange the query a bit by moving it outside the component. In the component body  instead we use useQuery  , as in Listing 11-27.  203   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne  Listing 11-27.  src App.tsx - GraphQL Query with Apollo Hook  import React from "react"; import { gql, useQuery } from "@apollo client"; import Form from ". Form"; import Select from ". Select";  const GET_CLIENTS = gql`  query getClients {    getClients {      id      email    }  } `;  const App =    => {  const { loading, data } = useQuery GET_CLIENTS ;   const handleSubmit =      event: React.FormEvent     => {    event.preventDefault  ;       client.mutate    };   return loading ?       Loading ...     :             <Select        id="user"        name="user"        options={data.getClients}       >  204   ChaPTer 11    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh ariaDne         ; };  export default App;  Both Form and Select can stay the same. We can also notice that useQuery   takes   our query as an argument and gives back for free a loading Boolean, convenient for  conditional rendering, and a data object which contains the query result. This is much  cleaner than client.query  . If we run the project again, everything should still work  as expected, with a   rendered in the UI. With this change we now take full  advantage of the declarative style of hooks, paired with GraphQL.

Getting Started with Strawberry in Django In the beginning, GraphQL was mainly targeted at JavaScript.  It’s not a coincidence that most early implementations of GraphQL servers were   written for Node.js. In time, most programming communities picked up interest in this  new paradigm for data querying, and these days we have a GraphQL implementation in  most languages. In the Python land, we explored Ariadne and we mentioned Graphene.     Valentino Gagliardi 2021  V. Gagliardi, Decoupled Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-7144-5_12  207   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry  What makes Strawberry different from these libraries? First off, Strawberry uses Python  dataclasses heavily. Dataclasses in Python are a simple way to declare concise classes  with attributes and optional logic. The following example shows a Python dataclass:  class User:    name: str    email: str  In this example, we declared a Python class with no behavior, but with two attributes,   name and email. These attributes are also strongly typed; that is, they are able to enforce  the kind of type they can hold, which is strings in this case. Strawberry makes heavy use  of Python type hints. Type hints are an optional Python feature that can improve the  robustness of our code. Python, much like JavaScript, is a dynamic language that does not  enforce static types. With type hints, we can add a type layer to our Python code, which  can be checked with a tool named MyPy before releasing the code in production. This  can catch nasty bugs that could make their way to the runtime environment. Additionally,  static type checks improve the developer experience. In Strawberry, we will use  dataclasses to define our GraphQL types and type hints all along the way. Time to practice!   Installing Strawberry To start off, we install Strawberry in our Django project:  pip install strawberry-graphql  After the installation, we update requirements base.txt to include the new   dependency. Next up, we enable Strawberry in decoupled_dj settings base.py, as  shown in Listing 12-1.  Listing 12-1.  decoupled_dj settings base.py - Enabling Strawberry in  INSTALLED_APPS  INSTALLED_APPS = [       ...       "strawberry.django", ]  to code-first.  208  With Strawberry enabled, we can move to refactoring the schema from schema-first    ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry   Designing the GraphQL Schema in Strawberry In the previous chapter, we created a GraphQL schema in a .graphql file.  Let’s recap what we have so far. Listing 12-2 shows the GraphQL schema we   assembled in Chapter 11.  Listing 12-2.  billing schema.graphql - The Original GraphQL Schema  enum InvoiceState {    PAID    UNPAID    CANCELLED }  type User {    id: ID    name: String    email: String }  type Invoice {    user: User    date: String    dueDate: String    state: InvoiceState    items: [ItemLine] }  type ItemLine {    quantity: Int    description: String    price: Float    taxed: Boolean }  type Query {    getClients: [User]    getClient id: ID! : User }  209   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry  input ItemLineInput {    quantity: Int!    description: String!    price: Float!    taxed: Boolean! }  input InvoiceInput {    user: ID!    date: String!    dueDate: String!    state: InvoiceState    items: [ItemLineInput!]! }  type Mutation {    invoiceCreate invoice: InvoiceInput! : Invoice! }  In this schema, we used most of the GraphQL scalar types the language has to offer,   plus our custom types and input types definitions. We also created two queries and  a mutation. To appreciate what Strawberry has to offer, let’s port each element of our  schema from a plain text schema to Python code.   Types and Enums in Strawberry To start off we begin with the base types of our GraphQL schema.  We need to declare User, Invoice, and ItemLine. To create the schema, open   billing schema.py, wipe out all the code we created in Chapter 11, and import the  modules shown in Listing 12-3.  Listing 12-3.  billing schema.py - Initial Imports  import strawberry import datetime import decimal  from typing import List  210   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry  typing is the main Python module from which we can peruse the most common   type declarations. Next is strawberry itself. We also need the decimal module and the  quintessential datetime. Next up, we are ready to create our first types. Listing 12-4  shows three GraphQL types in Strawberry.  Listing 12-4.  billing schema.py - First Types in Strawberry  import strawberry import datetime import decimal  from typing import List  @strawberry.type class User:    id: strawberry.ID    name: str    email: str  @strawberry.type class Invoice:    user: User    date: datetime.date    due_date: datetime.date    state: InvoiceState    items: List["ItemLine"]  @strawberry.type class ItemLine:    quantity: int    description: str    price: decimal.Decimal    taxed: bool  For someone new to Python typings, there a lot of things here that need a bit of   explanation. Thankfully, Python is expressive enough to not overcomplicate things. Let’s  start from the top.  211   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry  To declare a new GraphQL type in Strawberry we use the @strawberry.type  decorator, which goes on top of our dataclasses. Next, each type is declared as a  dataclass, each containing a set of attributes. In Chapters 1 and 11, we saw GraphQL  scalar types. In Strawberry there isn’t anything special to describe these scalars, apart  from strawberry.ID. As you can see in Listing 12-4, most scalar types are represented as  Python primitives: str, int, and bool. The only exception to this are the types for date  and due_date, which we declared as strings in the original GraphQL schema. Since types  in Strawberry are dataclasses, and dataclasses are “just” Python code, instead of strings  for our date, we can now use datetime.date objects. This was one of our unsolved  problems in Chapter 11, and it’s now fixed.  Note  you may wonder what’s the deal with due_date here and dueDate  from the previous chapter. in the original GraphQL schema, we used dueDate  in camel case. ariadne converts this syntax to snake case before it reaches  the Django orM. now we use snake case again in the GraphQL schema. why?  being Python code, the convention is to use snake case for longish variables and  function names. but this time, the conversion happens the other way around: in the  GraphQL documentation schema, Strawberry will display the field as camel case!  Moving forward, notice how the relations are described by associating the dataclass   attribute with the corresponding entity, like the User dataclass assigned to user in  Invoice. Also note that the List type from Python typings to associate ItemLine  to items. Previously, we used the Float scalar from GraphQL for the price of each  ItemLine. In Python, we can use a more appropriate decimal.Decimal. Even from a  simple listing like this, we can deduce that the Strawberry approach to writing GraphQL  schemas as Python code brings a lot of benefits, including type safety, flexibility, and  better handling of scalar types.  In the original GraphQL schema, we had an enum type associated with Invoice,   which specifies whether the invoice is paid, unpaid, or cancelled. In the new schema  we already have Invoice, so it’s a matter of adding the enum. In Strawberry, we can use  plain Python enums to declare the corresponding GraphQL type. In the schema file, add  the enumeration, as in Listing 12-5  this should go before User .  212   Listing 12-5.  billing schema.py - Enum Type in Strawberry  ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry  ... from enum import Enum  @strawberry.enum class InvoiceState Enum :    PAID = "PAID"    UNPAID = "UNPAID"    CANCELLED = "CANCELLED" ...  This is quite similar to the choices for our Invoice model in Django. With a bit of   creativity, one could reuse this Strawberry enum in the Django model  or the other  way around . With the enum in place, we are almost ready to test things out. Let’s add  resolvers and queries in the next sections.   Working with Resolvers  Again  We already learned that a GraphQL schema needs resolvers to return data.  Let’s add two resolvers to our schema, copied almost straight from Chapter 11  see   Listing 12-6 .  Listing 12-6.  billing schema.py - Adding Resolvers to the Schema  ... from users.models import User as UserModel ...  def resolve_clients  :    return UserModel.objects.all    def resolve_client id: strawberry.ID :    return UserModel.objects.get id=id   To avoid clashing with the User GraphQL type here, we import our user model  as UserModel. Next up, we declare resolvers to fulfill the original GraphQL queries,  namely getClient and getClients. Notice how we pass an id as the argument to the   213   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry  second resolver to fetch a single user by ID as we did in the previous chapter. With these  resolvers in place we can add a Query type and finally wire up the GraphQL endpoint in  the next section.   Queries in Strawberry and Wiring Up the GraphQL  Endpoint With the fundamental types and the resolvers in place, we can create a code-first Query  type for our API.   Add the code shown in Listing 12-7 to the schema file.  Listing 12-7.  billing schema.py - Adding a Root Query Type  @strawberry.type class Query:    get_clients: List[User] = strawberry.field resolver=resolve_clients     get_client: User = strawberry.field resolver=resolve_client  schema = strawberry.Schema query=Query   Here we are telling Strawberry that there’s a Query type for GraphQL with two fields.   Let’s look at these fields in detail:          get_clients returns a list of Users and is connected to the resolver  named resolve_clients  get_client returns a single User and is connected to the resolver  named resolve_client  Both resolvers are wrapped with strawberry.field  . Notice that both queries   will be converted to camel case in the GraphQL documentation, even though they are  declared as snake case in our code. In the last line we load our schema into Strawberry,  so it is picked up and served to the user. It is important to note that resolvers in  Strawberry don’t have to be disconnected from the Query dataclass itself. In fact, we  could have declared them as methods in the Query. We leave these two resolvers outside  of the dataclass, but we will see mutations as methods of the Mutation dataclass in a  moment.  214   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry  With this logic in place, we can connect the GraphQL layer to the Django URL system   in billing urls.py. Remove the GraphQL view from Ariadne. This time, instead of  a regular view, we use the asynchronous GraphQL view from Strawberry, as shown in  Listing 12-8.  Listing 12-8.  billing urls.py - Wiring Up the GraphQL Endpoint  ... from strawberry.django.views import AsyncGraphQLView ...  app_name = "billing"  urlpatterns = [    ...    path "graphql ",         AsyncGraphQLView.as_view schema=schema ,         name="graphql"          , ]  By running the GraphQL API asynchronously, we have a world of new possibilities,  but a lot of new things to think about as well, as we will see in a moment. We explore an  example in the next sections. Remember that to run Django asynchronously, we need  an ASG-capable server like Uvicorn. We installed this package in Chapter 5, but to recap,  you can install Uvicorn with the following command:  pip install uvicorn  already:  Next, export the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable if you haven’t   export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=decoupled_dj.settings.development  Finally, run the server with the following command:  uvicorn decoupled_dj.asgi:application --reload  The --reload flag ensures that Uvicorn reloads on file changes. If everything goes   well, you should see the following output:  INFO: Uvicorn running on http:  127.0.0.1:8000  Press CTRL+C to quit   215   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry  Throughout the next sections, we will run Django under Uvicorn. Now we can head   over to http:  127.0.0.1:8000 billing graphql . This should open GraphiQL, a  playground for exploring the GraphQL API. In the playground, we can send out queries  and mutations and explore the schema and the integrated documentation, just as we  did with Ariadne. Now that you have the big picture, you can complete the schema with  input types and mutations.   Input Types and Mutations in Strawberry We saw that input types in GraphQL are basically arguments for a mutation.  To define an input type in Strawberry, we still create a dataclass, but this time we   use the @strawberry.input decorator on top of it. Let’s create two input types for  ItemLineInput and InvoiceInput  this code can go after the Query type ; see Listing 12-9.  Listing 12-9.  billing schema.py - Adding Input Types to the Schema  ... @strawberry.input class ItemLineInput:    quantity: int    description: str    price: decimal.Decimal    taxed: bool  @strawberry.input class InvoiceInput:    user: strawberry.ID    date: datetime.date    due_date: datetime.date    state: InvoiceState    items: List[ItemLineInput]  216  Here we have dataclasses with the appropriate attribute for the input type. As the  icing, ... oops, strawberry, on the cake, let’s add a mutation as well  see Listing 12-10 .   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry  Listing 12-10.  billing schema.py - Adding a Mutation to the Schema  ... import dataclasses ... from billing.models import Invoice as InvoiceModel from billing.models import ItemLine as ItemLineModel ... @strawberry.type class Mutation:    @strawberry.mutation    def create_invoice self, invoice: InvoiceInput  -> Invoice:        _invoice = dataclasses.asdict invoice         user_id = _invoice.pop "user"         items = _invoice.pop "items"         state = _invoice.pop "state"          new_invoice = InvoiceModel.objects.create             user_id=user_id, state=state.value, **_invoice                 for item in items:            ItemLineModel.objects.create invoice=_invoice, **item         return new_invoice  schema = strawberry.Schema query=Query, mutation=Mutation   This code bears a bit of explanation. First off, we import our Django models again,   this time by aliasing them to avoid clashes with the dataclasses. Next up, we define  a Mutation and a method inside it. The method, named create_invoice  , takes  InvoiceInput input type as a parameter and is decorated with @strawberry.mutation.  Inside the method we convert the dataclass input type to a dictionary. This is important  because the mutation parameter is a dataclass, not a dictionary. This way, we can pop  out the keys we need, as we did with Ariadne. In the mutation, we also pop out state,  which is later passed as state.value to InvoiceModel.objects.create  . At the time of  this writing, Strawberry doesn’t convert automatically enums keys to strings, so we need  to do a bit of data drilling. Finally, notice the type annotation for the return value of this  mutation, Invoice. At the very end of the file we also load the mutation dataclass into  the schema.  217   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry  Mutation and input types complete our GraphQL schema for now. At this stage we  could use the GraphiQL Playground to send an invoiceCreate mutation, but instead of  trying things manually, we will implement the mutation in our React frontend. But first,  let’s look at the implications of running Strawberry asynchronously with Django.   Working Asynchronously with the Django ORM After setting everything up, you might have noticed that by sending even a simple query  in GraphiQL, everything blows up.  Even by sending out a simple query, Django will respond with the following error:  You cannot call this from an async context - use a thread or sync_to_async.  The error is a bit cryptic, but this comes from the ORM layer. At the time of writing,  Django’s ORM isn’t async-ready yet. This means we can’t simply launch ORM queries  while running Django asynchronously. To work around the issue we need to wrap ORM  interactions with an asynchronous adapter called sync_to_async from ASGI. To keep  things digestible, we first move the actual ORM queries into separate functions. Then, we  wrap these functions with sync_to_async. Listing 12-11 shows the required changes.  Listing 12-11.  billing schema.py - Converting ORM Queries to Work  Asynchronously  ... from asgiref.sync import sync_to_async ...  def _get_all_clients  :    return list UserModel.objects.all     async def resolve_clients  :    return await sync_to_async _get_all_clients     def _get_client id :    return UserModel.objects.get id=id   async def resolve_client id: strawberry.ID :    return await sync_to_async _get_client  id   218   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry  Let’s look at what is going on here. First off, we move the ORM logic to two regular  functions. In the first function, _get_all_clients  , we fetch all the clients from the  database with .all  . We also force Django to evaluate the queryset by converting it  to a list with list  . It’s necessary to evaluate the query in the asynchronous context,  because Django querysets are lazy by default. In the second function, _get_client  ,  we simply get a single user from the database. Both functions are then called in two  asynchronous functions, wrapped in sync_to_async  . This machinery will make ORM  code work under ASGI.  Resolvers are not the only piece that needs the async wrapper. While at this stage, we   don’t expect anybody to hit our GraphQL mutation furiously, the ORM code for saving  new invoices needs to be wrapped too. Again, we can pull out the ORM-related code to  separate functions and then wrap these with sync_to_async, as shown in Listing 12-12.  Listing 12-12.  billing schema.py - Converting ORM Queries to Work  Asynchronously  ... from asgiref.sync import sync_to_async ... def _create_invoice user_id, state, invoice :     return InvoiceModel.objects.create user_id=user_id, state=state.value,   **invoice   def _create_itemlines invoice, item :    ItemLineModel.objects.create invoice=invoice, **item   @strawberry.type class Mutation:    @strawberry.mutation    async def create_invoice self, invoice: InvoiceInput  -> Invoice:        _invoice = dataclasses.asdict invoice         user_id = _invoice.pop "user"         items = _invoice.pop "items"         state = _invoice.pop "state"           new_invoice = await sync_to_async _create_invoice  user_id, state,   _invoice   219   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry         for item in items:            await sync_to_async _create_itemlines  new_invoice, item         return new_invoice  This might seem like a lot of code to do something that Django provides out-of-   the-box, namely SQL queries, but this is the price to pay at this moment in order to run  Django asynchronously. In the future, we hope to have better async support for the ORM  layer. For now, with these changes, we are ready to run Strawberry and Django side by  side asynchronously. We can now move to the frontend to implement mutations with  Apollo Client.   Working Again on the Frontend In Chapter 11, we began to work on a React TypeScript frontend, which acted as a client  for our GraphQL API.  So far, we implemented a simple query in the frontend for a   component.   First, we worked with Apollo client.query  , which is a lowish-level method for making  queries. Then, we refactored to use the useQuery   hook. In the following sections, we  tackle mutations in the frontend with Apollo Client and useMutation  .  Note  For the react part, we work in decoupled_dj billing react_spa.  each proposed file must be created or changed in the appropriate subfolder,  starting from this path.   Creating Invoices with a Mutation We left the previous chapter with the App component shown in Listing 12-13.  Listing 12-13.  src App.tsx - GraphQL Query with Apollo  import React from "react"; import { gql, useQuery } from "@apollo client"; import Form from ". Form"; import Select from ". Select";  220   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry  const GET_CLIENTS = gql`  query getClients {    getClients {      id      email    }  } `;  const App =    => {  const { loading, data } = useQuery GET_CLIENTS ;   const handleSubmit =      event: React.FormEvent     => {    event.preventDefault  ;       client.mutate    };   return loading ?       Loading ...     :             <Select        id="user"        name="user"        options={data.getClients}       >        ; };  export default App;  This component uses a query to populate the   as soon as it is mounted   in the DOM. It’s now time to implement a mutation. So far in Ariadne, we sent out  mutations by providing the mutation payload in the GraphQL Playground. This time,  things change a bit in the frontend: we need to use useMutation   from Apollo Client.  First, we import the new hook, as shown in Listing 12-14.  221   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry  Listing 12-14.  src App.tsx - Importing useMutation  ... import { gql, useQuery, useMutation } from "@apollo client"; ...  Next, right after the GET_CLIENTS query, we declare a mutation named CREATE_  INVOICE, as shown in Listing 12-15.  Listing 12-15.  src App.tsx - Declaring a Mutation  ... const CREATE_INVOICE = gql`  mutation createInvoice $invoice: InvoiceInput!  {    createInvoice invoice: $invoice  {      date      state    }  } `; ...  This mutation looks a bit like a function, as it takes a parameter and returns some   data to the caller. But the parameter in this case is an input type. Now, in App we use the  new hook. The usage of useMutation   recalls useState   from React: we can array-  destructure a function from the hook. Listing 12-16 shows the mutation hook in our  component.  Listing 12-16.  src App.tsx - Using the useMutation Hook  ... const App =    => {  const { loading, data } = useQuery GET_CLIENTS ;  const [createInvoice] = useMutation CREATE_INVOICE ; ...  In addition, we can also destructure an object with two properties: error and   loading. As with the query, these will provide info in case of errors, and a loading state  to conditionally render the UI during the mutation. To avoid clashing with loading   222   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry  from the query, we assign a new name to the mutation loader. Listing 12-17 shows the  changes.  Listing 12-17.  src App.tsx - Using the useMutation Hook with Loading and Error  ... const App =    => {   const { loading, data } = useQuery GET_CLIENTS ;   const [       createInvoice,       { error, loading: mutationLoading },   ] = useMutation CREATE_INVOICE ; ...  Now that we’ve met mutations, let’s see how to use them in the frontend. From the   useMutation   hook, we destructured createInvoice  , a function that we can now call  in response to some user interaction. In this case we already have an handleSubmit   in  our component, and that is a good place to send out a mutation to create new data into  the database. It is important to note that the mutation will return a promise. This means  we can use then   catch   finally   or try catch finally with async await.  What can we send in the mutation? More important, how can we use it? Once we get  the mutator function from the hook, we can call it by providing an option object, which  should contain at least the mutation variables. The following example illustrates how we  can use this mutation:  ...    await createInvoice {      variables: {        invoice: {          user: 1,          date: "2021-05-01",          dueDate: "2021-05-31",          state: "UNPAID",          items: [            {              description: "Django consulting",              price: 7000,  223   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry               taxed: true,              quantity: 1,            },          ],        },      },    } ; ...  In this mutation, we send the entire input type for the mutation, as declared in our  schema. In this example, we hardcode some data, but in the real world we might want  to get mutation variables dynamically with JavaScript. This is exactly what we did in  Chapter 6, when we built a POST payload from a form with FormData. Let’s complete our  form by adding the appropriate inputs and a Submit button. To start, Listing 12-18 shows  the complete React form  for brevity, we skip any CSS and stylistic concerns here .  Listing 12-18.  src App.tsx - The Complete Form     <Select    id="user"    name="user"    options={data.getClients}   >        Date                 Due date     <input      id="dueDate"      name="dueDate"      type="date"      required     >     224   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry         Qty     <input      id="quantity"      name="quantity"      type="number"      min="0"      max="10"      required     >           Description     <input      id="description"      name="description"      type="text"      required     >           Price     <input      id="price"      name="price"      type="number"      min="0"      step="0.01"      required     >           Taxed           225   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry   {mutationLoading ?       Creating the invoice ...     :       CREATE INVOICE    }    This form contains all the inputs for creating a new invoice. At the bottom, note the   conditional rendering based on the state of mutationLoading.  This is a nice thing to have in order to inform the user about the state of request.  With the form in place, we can assemble the logic for sending out the mutation from  handleSubmit  . For convenience, we can use async await with try catch. Some  words before looking at the code:     We build the mutation payload starting from a FormData      In the building logic, we convert quantity to an integer and taxed to  a Boolean  These last steps are necessary because our GraphQL schema expects quantity to be  an integer, while in the form it is simply a string. Listing 12-19 shows the complete code.  Listing 12-19.  src App.tsx - Logic for Sending the Mutation  const handleSubmit = async    event: React.FormEvent    => {  event.preventDefault  ;  if  event.target instanceof HTMLFormElement  {    const formData = new FormData event.target ;     const invoice = {      user: formData.get "user" ,      date: formData.get "date" ,      dueDate: formData.get "dueDate" ,      state: "UNPAID",      items: [        {          quantity: parseInt   226   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry             formData.get "quantity"  as string           ,          description: formData.get "description" ,          price: formData.get "price" ,          taxed: Boolean formData.get "taxed"  ,        },      ],    };     try {      const { data } = await createInvoice {        variables: { invoice },      } ;      event.target.reset  ;    } catch  error  {      console.error error ;    }  } };  Apart from the FormData logic, the rest is pretty straightforward:     We send out the mutation with createInvoice   by providing an   invoice payload      If everything goes well, we reset the form with event.target. reset    If we test things in the browser, we should be able to send out the mutation and get a  response from the server. This process can be seen in the browser’s console, as shown in  Figure 12-1, where the Response tab is highlighted.  227   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry  Figure 12-1.  The mutation response from the GraphQL server  In REST, when we create or modify a resource with a POST or PATCH request, the   API responds with a payload. GraphQL makes no exceptions. In fact, we can access the  response data on the mutation, as shown in the following snippet:  const { data } = await createInvoice {  variables: { invoice }, } ;    do something with the data  228   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry  In Figure 12-1, we can see the data object containing a property named   createInvoice, which holds the fields we requested from the mutation. We can also see  __typename. This is part of GraphQL’s introspection capabilities, which make it possible  to ask GraphQL “what type is this object”? An explanation of GraphQL introspection is  out of the scope of this book, but the official documentation is a good starting point for  learning more.  Note  it is a good moment to commit the changes you made so far and to  push the work to your Git repo. you can find the source code for this chapter  at https:  github.com valentinogagliardi decoupled- dj tree  chapter_12_graphql_strawberry.   What’s Next? We’ve barely scratched the surface of GraphQL in these last pages. The subject is bigger  than two chapters. The following is a list of topics that you can explore on your own after  finishing this book:     Authentication and deployment: In fully decoupled setups, GraphQL   works well with JWT tokens for authentication. However, the  specification does not enforce any particular type of authentication  method. This means it is possible to use session-based  authentication for GraphQL API, as we saw in Chapter 10 for REST.     Subscriptions: GraphQL Python libraries for Django can integrate   with Django Channels to provide subscriptions over WebSocket.     Testing: Testing GraphQL API does not involve any magic. Since   they accept and return JSON, any testing HTTP client for Python or  Django can be used to test a GraphQL endpoint.     Sorting, filtering, and pagination: It’s easy to sort, filter, and paginate   responses with Django and the Django REST Framework tools.  However, to implement the same things in GraphQL, we need  to write a bit of code by hand. But since GraphQL queries accept  arguments, it’s not so hard to build custom filtering capabilities in a  GraphQL API.  229   ChaPTer 12    GraPhQL in DjanGo wiTh STrawberry     Performances: Since queries in GraphQL can be nested, great care   must be taken to avoid crashing our database with N+1 queries. Most  GraphQL libraries include a so-called dataloader, which takes care of  caching database queries.  EXERCISE 12-1: ADDING MORE ASYNCHRONOUS MUTATIONS  The wireframe in Chapter 6 has a Send email button. Try to implement this logic in the react  frontend, with a mutation. on the backend, you will also need a new asynchronous mutation to  send the email.  EXERCISE 12-2: TESTING GRAPHQL  add tests to this simple application: you can test the GraphQL endpoint with Django testing  tools and test the interface with Cypress.   Summary In this chapter, we closed the circle with the basics of GraphQL and asynchronous  Django. You learned how to:     Use GraphQL mutations in the backend and in the frontend     Work with asynchronous Django  Now it’s your turn! Go build your next Django project!

Apply decoupling patterns, properly test a decoupled project, and integrate a Django API with React, and Vue.js. This book covers decoupled architectures in Django, with Django REST framework and GraphQL. With practical and simple examples, you’ll see firsthand how, why, and when to decouple a Django project. Starting with an introduction to decoupled architectures versus monoliths, with a strong focus on the modern JavaScript scene, you’ll implement REST and GraphQL APIs with Django, add authentication to a decoupled project, and test the backend. You’ll then review functional testing for JavaScript frontends with Cypress. You will also learn how to integrate GraphQL in a Django project, with a focus on the benefits and drawbacks of this new query language
