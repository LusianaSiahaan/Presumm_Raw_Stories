Foreword  Peter Mossack Vice President of Research and Development Software AG  What’s all the fuss about a markup language? Read this book and you’ll ﬁnd out!  XML  represents  a  movement.  It  is  similar  in  nature  to  the  “open” movement. Open source, open interfaces, open  operating  systems. In fact, XML is the next pillar in this movement. It can be viewed as the open movement extended to the Internet. It is because of this that, as a set  of  pure  standards,  XML  is  looked  after  by  the  World  Wide  Web Consortium.  However, the whole world is talking XML, and the ramiﬁcations of its universal adoption are only beginning to surface. Whole business models will be affected by it; whole new business interests are being pursued be- cause of it. The software industry itself will be rocked by it more than it cares to admit. This is so because XML brings us into the promised land of componentware. Take XML-based componentware, add the Internet, and you get Web services. A very explosive mixture indeed!  By adhering to open standards, smaller companies with strong vertical knowledge will be able to deliver components and services that can be in- tegrated with those of other suppliers, and so be able to compete effec- tively in their area of expertise.  Besides the purely technical merit of this, what lies at the bottom of the movement is an unwillingness on the part of the consumer of tech- nology, especially the corporate consumer, to be continually locked in by megavendors of proprietary technology and application software.  Since a technology lock-in also implies economic dependency, there are real business reasons behind the open movement. It is therefore very important that people involved in making technology decisions, as well as business decisions based on technology, understand the basis of it.  This book should not only help with this, but also provide the reader with food for thought in conceiving and conceptualizing new strategic applications based on XML technology.  vii    Preface  Scenario  IMPLICATIONS  ABOUT THIS BOOK ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  ................................................................. ........................................ ................................... .............................................................. ................................. ...................................

It is set in a triangle made up of document pro- cessing, traditional data processing, and the Internet  see Figure P. 1 . Its language roots are in well-established document processing technologies  SGML , its technology moves massively into the area of databases and enterprise IT technology, and its application is mainly to establish com- munication between collaborating parties on the Internet, extranet, and intranet.  The same three ingredients also deﬁne electronic business:  Electronic Business = Internet + Enterprise IT + Documents  XML is thus well positioned as a core technology for the rapidly grow- ing area of electronic business  see Figure P. 2 . Its adoption by the indus- try  has  consequently  been  quick.  Although  the  initial  hype  has  faded away,  XML  has  now  achieved  mainstream  status  in  the  corporate  IT world. The question of today for XML is not if but how.  A  recent  study  done  by  the  Giga  Information  Group   2001   among  companies that use XML shows    45% use XML for mission-critical applications.   13% use XML for non–mission-critical applications.   40% use XML for pilot applications.  The study shows also that XML is used in different areas. Not surprisingly most areas are somehow connected to communication and integration:    33% use XML for data exchange and messaging.   27% use XML for application integration.   13% use XML for data integration.   12% use XML for content publishing.   6% use XML for the construction of portals.   6% use XML for other purposes.  xvii   xviii  Preface  Internet  XML  Business to Consumer  Business to Business  Documents  Databases  Figure P.1 Set between three technologies: XML.  2800 2600 2400 2200 2000 1800 1600 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200    s n o  i l l i  b      $    .

Source: Forrester Research.    Preface  xix  Given these fairly disparate application areas and the triangle of docu- ments,  databases,  and  Internet,  we  witness  an  extraordinary  culture clash: document people trying to understand what a transaction is, data- base analysts getting upset because the relational model doesn’t ﬁt any- more, and Web designers having to deal with schemata and rule-based transformations.  Finally, when they have sorted out their differences, they start to real- ize that agreement about “where to put the brackets” is only the ﬁrst step in mastering what is probably the most difﬁcult thing on earth: human communication. What lurks behind the standardization of communica- tion structures are the semantic aspects of communications, the vocabu- laries, thesauri, ontologies, and contexts—a topic that has been placed onto the agenda of the W3C under the name “Semantic Web,” and opti- mistically scheduled for 2003!  ABOUT THIS BOOK  It was this situation that made us write this book. The ﬁrst step when dif- ferent technologies meet is to do an inventory of what is there. The sec- ond step is a critical review in the light of the new requirements. Finally a synthesis can be tried and a new technology begins to emerge.  So, if you are expecting a description of the ﬁnal tried-and-tested XML architecture, this book isn’t for you. Such a thing does not exist, not yet.  Maybe it never will.  But if you have an inquiring mind and want to look over the fence, this book is deﬁnitely for you. But be warned: you may end up more curious about XML and related technologies than you were before. At least, that is what happened to us . . .  People with a background in document processing will ﬁnd it interest- ing how they can use conceptual modeling to model business scenarios consisting of business objects, relationships, processes, and transactions in a document-centric way. They might also discover that XML can be used  for  some  things  that  are  very  different  from  “library  style”  docu- ments—standards  such  as  SMIL  and  SVG  allow  the  deﬁnition  of  rich multimedia presentations.  Database people might wonder if XML is subject to relational normal- ization and how this meshes with the hierarchical structure of XML doc- uments. We will therefore revisit tried and tested modeling techniques such  as  entity  relationship  modeling,  but  we  will  also  introduce  asset-   xx  Preface  oriented  modeling—a  new  technique  that  is  better  suited  to  capturing the higher-order relationships between entities and artifacts.  Web designers will discover that XML puts them into a position to au- tomatically  generate  visually  pleasing  Web  pages  and  rich  multimedia shows from otherwise dry product catalogues by using XSLT and other transformation tools. They will also learn why “hard linked” Web pages are bad, and what the alternatives are to allow for sophisticated naviga- tion by end users.  Business architects will see how XML can help them to deﬁne applica- tions that can be quickly adapted to the ever-changing requirements of the market. Hard-coded workﬂows and business rules in applications are replaced by XML documents that can be changed quickly. Even better: new technologies like ebXML allow business partners to negotiate com- mon business processes in an automatic or semiautomatic fashion.  Y  Chapter  1  sets  the  scenario. We  compare  the  Internet  with  an  un- planned  settlement.  XML  can  be  the  glue  that  holds  it  all  together  to build  an  infrastructure.  We  strongly  argue  that—because  XML  is  really about communication—the current challenge is to build medium-scale well-working  applications  that  can  communicate  with  each  other.  We present some architectural patterns that have proved to work.  E  A  F L  M  Chapter 2 lays the groundwork. It discusses many of the W3C and other basic  standards  and  techniques  related  to  XML:  DTDs,  XML  Schema, XPath, XPointer, Xinclude, XML Base, XLink, XQuery, XSL, SAX, DOM, Schematron, and architectural forms.  T  Chapter 3 discusses techniques to model the structure of information. We revisit good old entity relationship modeling and also introduce asset- oriented modeling—a modeling method that is easy to use and ﬁts well into an XML-oriented architecture. We show how RDF can be utilized to describe conceptual models, and how UML can deal with XML.  Chapter  4  moves  from  structure  to  meaning.  Communication  across company borders and company mergers demonstrates that it is not sufﬁ- cient  to  agree  about  the  structure  of  information.  We  discuss  ways  to model semantics, such as ontologies and topic maps. If you want to know what the Semantic Web is about, here it is!  Chapter 5 takes a close look at modeling processes such as workﬂows or business processes. We show how process can be described by means of XML.  Chapter 6 introduces a layered approach to communication. We discuss channels, ports, messages, transactions, and scenarios in the context of open communication across company borders.  Team-Fly®   Preface  xxi  Chapter 7 illustrates ways of navigation that go beyond links in Web pages. With WebML we discuss an integrated approach from conceptual model to ﬁnished Web site. We revisit topic maps as a powerful means for an independent navigation layer. We also discuss the navigational possi- bilities that exist with peer-to-peer communication.  The topic of Chapter 8 is presentation. XML isn’t just about data repre- sentation  and  communication;  it  is  also  the  basis  for  powerful  multi- media standards such as SMIL, SVG, and XSL formatting objects.  Chapter 9 deals with document transformation, in particular with XSLT, with its advantages and shortcomings. We take a look at alternatives, too. Chapter 10 introduces recent standards that deﬁne an infrastructure for electronic  business.  In  particular  we  discuss  SOAP,  WSDL,  UDDI,  and most importantly, ebXML.  Chapter 11 acts as a showcase for existing solutions. We look into  the still rare  XML-related design tools, discuss XML-enabled database man- agement  systems  and  middleware  solutions  such  as  RosettaNet  and BizTalk  even the non-XML technology e-speak , and ﬁnally some XML- related authoring tools.  The glossary explains relevant terms in the context of XML and elec-  tronic business.  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  This book incorporates many research and development results from a number of XML-oriented communities. Our ﬁrst debt of gratitude is to our colleagues in and the members of those communities. Without their work, this book would have never happened. We also render our deepest appreciation to all the people that helped us in so many different ways at the various stages in the writing of this book.  First  we  would  like  to  thank  Morgan  Kaufmann  Publishers  and dpunkt.verlag for giving us the opportunity to publish our work. It has been  a  great  pleasure,  indeed,  to  work  with  the  people  at  MKP  and dpunkt. Thanks go especially to Tim Cox and Stacie Pierce from Morgan Kaufmann,  who  patiently  helped  us  through  the  materialization  and publication of the book and had to put up with our slightly Teutonic En- glish, and to Rene Schönfeldt from dpunkt, who guided us from the very beginning of the project.  We  also  deeply  acknowledge  the  work  of  our  reviewers:  Tom  Jell, Kevin Jones, Jeff Jurvis, Janne Kalliola, Eve Maler, Tom Marrs, and David   xxii  Preface  Orchard.  Their  enthusiasm,  expertise,  and  wisdom  have  helped  us  in bringing this project to success. Their invaluable advice has signiﬁcantly improved the book in detail and overall structure.  Our rough manuscript was brought into shape and was transformed into a real book by the production staff at MKP. Howard Severson was the production editor, Ken DellaPenta was the copyeditor, Mary Roybal did the  proofreading,  and  Ty  Koontz  did  the  indexing.  After  seeing  the marked-up manuscript, we know how much we owe these four.  Thanks go also to our friends at Software AG, especially to Nigel O. Hutchinson,  Michael  Kay,  Peter  Mosack,  Jonathan  Robie,  and  Walter Waterfeld for providing valuable insight into the world of XML Schema, XQuery,  XSLT,  and  native  XML  databases.  Thanks  go,  too,  to  Tina Eisinger from altova GmbH for helping us with the production of XML Schema diagrams.  And ﬁnally, none of this could have been realized without the help of our families and friends. Family members and partners, friends and col- leagues suffered a lot—not only with us but sometimes also because of us—in countless situations. When the going gets tough. . . . Our thanks and love goes to all of you for helping us and patiently supporting our work throughout the entire authoring process.   1Scenario  1.1 Megapolis Internet  1.2  Implications  1.3 Architectural Patterns  1.4  Best Practices  XML would not exist if there were no Internet. Without  the requirements of the open and diverse Internet com-  munity, the extensibility and standardization of XML would be  wasted.  Therefore,  XML  architecture  must  take  the  Internet  into account: its topology, its philosophy, and its history.  In  this  chapter,  we  ﬁrst  take  a  look  at  the  topology  of   so-called nonplanned settlements, which applies to the Inter-  net. We argue that architects must, above all, be good com-  municators who facilitate mutual learning between the Net  squatters.  Aside from that, there are a few common concepts that  become  more  important  in  such  an  environment.  Applica-  tions increasingly consist of collaborating but separate units,  instead  of  being  implemented  as  monolithic  blocks.  Soft  logic,  such  as  the  formulation  of  business  rules  with  XML,  allows  reconﬁguring  applications  rapidly,  and  techniques  derived from artiﬁcial intelligence allow the conﬁguration in  a more declarative way.  1   2  Chapter 1 Scenario  Finally, we look at some of the more common architectural patterns cur- rently  found  on  the  Internet  such  as  catalogues,  workﬂow  orchestration, repositories, and more.  A list of top-level best practices for XML architecture closes this chapter.  1.1 MEGAPOLIS INTERNET  This section ﬁrst reports on the outcome of a trip to the Bauhaus but then moves quickly from African villages to communities on the Internet.  1.1.1 The Nonplanned Settlement  During a visit to the Bauhaus Institute in Dessau, Germany, one book in the institute’s bookshop caught my attention. It was titled Non-planned Settlements. My ﬁrst thought was the Internet. My second thought was to buy the book. On closer examination it turned out that it did not deal with the Internet at all but with the topology of African villages and some of the world’s megacities. One result of the author’s research was the dis- covery that the network of roads, streets, and paths in these settlements was arranged in such a way that the effort to travel between A and B plus the  effort  to  maintain  this  network  is  close  to  minimal   Schaur  1991 . Similar networks were found in nature  leaves, insect wings . The author was also able to obtain these structures by simulation: because the equa- tions proved to be too complex for silicon-based computers, more tradi- tional means like soap water, wet threads, and sand were used.  Well, she got me hooked. I did a bit more research on unplanned set- tlements and discovered that most unplanned settlements serve the re- quirements of their residents better than formally planned settlements  Portela 1992 . Although unplanned settlements usually start with low- quality housing, the housing and the infrastructure continually improve and result in many cases in higher-quality housing than obtained with formal planning because the inhabitants are in control  Figure 1.1 .  What made me buy this book without further hesitation was the fact that the Internet is nothing but a nonplanned settlement. That does not mean, however, that the creation of Internet technology was unplanned; in fact, Internet technology was created as the result of a careful planning process by the U.S. Department of Defense. What I mean is that the cur- rent topology of the Internet is not the result of a single planned process. Nor  was  the  speed  with  which  the  Internet  and  especially  the  World Wide Web grew in any way anticipated. The computer and software in- dustry, for example, was completely taken by surprise.  The Internet’s architecture   1.1 Megapolis Internet  3  Figure 1.1 Architecture that works. Structural patterns of a Mediterranean megapolis.  Also  the  way  the  Internet  would  be  used  was  not  anticipated.  First planned as a computer network for military use, it was soon taken over by scientists and became a major communication device between scien- tiﬁc  institutions  worldwide.  Then,  beginning  in  1995  the  Internet  be- came commercial and—by now—electronic business is the main driving force in the development of the Internet  Daum and Scheller 2000 .  Five years later we are a bit wiser. We have witnessed tremendous suc- cess stories on the Web, but we have also seen many dot.coms and some other Internet squatters vanishing. Many ideas that looked good on pa- per did not succeed in the ﬁeld. Even a technically brilliant company like Sun Microsystems  “The network is the computer”  had to retarget a ma- jor development  Java moved from the browser to the server .  While the reasons for these “failure stories” are manifold—and not all are of a technical nature—we feel that in many cases the problem was that the Internet introduces a new set of challenges into software engi- neering.  Traditional  software  engineering  concepts  are  certainly  valid within an enterprise context, but for the macro level of the settlement In- ternet they are simply inappropriate.  Not  required  are  architects  who  try  to  superimpose  the  tried-and- tested  constructs  of  the  past—such  as  three-  or  four-tier  client-server architectures—onto the Internet world. Not that there is anything wrong   4  Chapter 1 Scenario  Transactional topology  with these models  they have served well within the enterprise world , but what is really required in the global village are architects who act as communicators and multipliers, architects who enable the inhabitants of the Internet to learn from each other and to improve their levels of skill and self-organization. The architects of systems become architects of communication. Let’s see how.  1.1.2 Topology—Transactional, Relational, Navigational  The ﬁrst time two users were connected to the same computer, the com- puter ceased to be a plain but expensive calculator and became a commu- nication  device.  Data  that  was  entered  by  one  user  could  be  read  and modiﬁed by another user.  The ﬁrst of these systems evolved at a time when computer hardware needed huge halls, air-conditioning, and specialist operators. Embedding computers into end user devices was unthinkable. End users communi- cated with the computer through teletypes and later through cathode ray tubes  CRTs  and keyboards. In terms of software, a major paradigm evolved at this time: the transactional multiuser database was developed. These databases guaranteed that a user could safely process a certain work unit  a transaction ; the system guaranteed that  a work unit was com- pletely processed  or not at all  and that other users could not interfere. Neither a system crash nor concurrent activities could corrupt the data. The transactional approach is still a core paradigm of today’s enterprise computing.  The situation changed when microelectronics made computers small enough to ﬁt on a desktop. When cheap workstations and PCs arrived on the market, departments would simply buy these devices without asking the  computer  center  or  corporate  controllers  for  permission.  They  had done this before with typewriters. In the view of the enterprises’ com- puter  centers  this  was  just  another  case  of  unplanned  settlement.  It evolved because it served the requirements of the users better than the centralized IT departments could. New functionality in shrink-wrapped packages could be bought in the computer shop around the corner. The traditional way of sending a request to the IT department and waiting for months for its realization had become too slow for a faster-moving busi- ness world.  But, with the now ubiquitous desktop machines, users had acquired a problem. Their computer had regressed from being a communication ma-   1.1 Megapolis Internet  5  chine to being a simple typewriter or calculator. Data was exchanged on ﬂoppies, resulting in chaos and a data jungle.  To  establish  communication  again,  it  was  necessary  to  connect  the desktop machines to a network. Local area networks  LANs  were intro- duced,  and  the  former  computer  center  now  operated  the  enterprise’s servers, where the critical data of the enterprise was held. This was the be- ginning of the client-server era. The client on the desktop would be re- sponsible for the  mostly graphic  user interface and for application logic, while the server in the computer center would run the big databases and care for database backup and security. The role of the computer center had changed: instead of caring for individual “housing,” it cared for the public infrastructure.  This had consequences for the database software, too. The old CODA- SYL  databases  were  too  inﬂexible  for  this  job.  Because  many  different clients with different requirements could hook up to the same server, it was necessary that the same data could be interpreted in different “views”  different combinations of data elements  depending on the application of  the  client.  Relational  databases  were  able  to  solve  this  problem.  Be- cause  these  databases  store  the  data  in  the  form  of  very  simple,  basic tables, they allow the arbitrary recombination of this data at will. While relational technology had already developed alongside transactional sys- tems, it had its breakthrough with client-server technology.  The Internet, and especially the World Wide Web, have changed this landscape once again. In the classic client-server scenario the relation is “many clients, one server,” and usually both client and server work in the same enterprise environment. In the World Wide Web it is, in contrast, not  one  server  but  millions  of  servers  in  millions  of  enterprises.  Each client can access any server on the Web and any Web service. In a few years, it will be billions of servers: any device connected to the Internet and able to hold data—a PC, a PDA, or an embedded device—can act as a Web server.  What does this mean for the user? It means that a vast array of new services are  or soon will be  available on the desktop, in the car, or in the palm of the hand—services that were previously unthinkable, or services that can be better performed by a third party than in-house. While in the beginning of the Internet only a few basic services were offered  email, home pages, search engines, ﬁle transfer , the landscape is now getting more and more diverse. The range goes from ﬁnancial services like credit card  validation,  to  community  services  such  as  an  ontology  server  for the knitwear industry or a knowledge base for hazardous chemicals, to generic applications hosted by Internet service providers.  Relational topology  Navigational topology   6  Chapter 1 Scenario  Navigation and service discovery  The most frequent activity for a Web client thus becomes—besides per- forming transactions—navigation and service discovery. In real cities we are used to using certain helpful devices to ﬁnd what we want. There are street and telephone directories. We know that shopping malls host the full spectrum of shops we need for daily life. If we don’t know our way around, we can rely  more or less  on the expertise of a taxi driver or of a passerby. And so on.  On the Internet things are similar. Within the short time of its exis- tence the Internet has developed certain patterns that can help us in the task  of  navigation.  There  are  simple  structures  like  Web  rings  or  Web communities,  sophisticated  search  engines  and  directory  services,  and fully serviced marketplaces and portals. More recently, peer-to-peer tech- nology  has  gained  a  lot  of  attention,  especially,  but  not  only,  for  ex- changing MP3 records.  1.1.3 Babel  Open standards  The development of the Internet and the World Wide Web was made pos- sible through the deﬁnition of open standards. Among those that have shaped the Internet are  Hardwired semantics    TCP IP  Transmission Control Protocol for the Internet    HTTP  Hypertext Transfer Protocol    SMTP  Simple Mail Protocol    FTP  File Transfer Protocol    HTML  Hypertext Markup Language   All these standards serve a speciﬁc task—they have clearly deﬁned seman- tics. The HTML speciﬁcation, for example, not only describes the syntax of Web pages, but also deﬁnes how a browser has to process the elements of an HTML Web page. Measured by numbers, these standards have been a tremendous success. Given the decentralized nature of the Internet, it is difﬁcult  to  get  reliable  statistics,  but  it  is  estimated  that  by  the  end  of 2000 more than 400 million users were connected to the Internet  Nua Internet Surveys  and that servers stored about 2 billion Web pages, with 7 million new Web pages being created every day.  But  the  hardwired  semantics  of  these  standards   especially  those  of HTML  have led to a problem: it is difﬁcult to adapt this technology to new application domains. Consequently HTML was subject to a number of proprietary “enhancements” during the period of the “Browser Wars” in the late 1990s. Today, Web pages consist of a wild mixture of HTML, JavaScript, Java, Shockwave, and so on, augmented by server technology   1.1 Megapolis Internet  7  XML  to generate dynamic Web pages such as ASP, JSP, Java Servlets, CGI, and so on.  The release of the XML recommendation in 1998 marks a break in this tradition  Bray, Paoli, and Sperberg-McQueen 1998 . XML was designed not as a special-purpose language but as a “mother of languages,” a generic metalanguage. The goal of its deﬁnition was extensibility. How- ever, the initial perception of XML was that of a “successor for HTML,” a misconception that needed to be clariﬁed before XML could really take off. The purpose of XML is not to become a better HTML  although one of its applications, XHTML, is the designated successor of HTML  but to al- low interested user groups the deﬁnition of their own speciﬁc languages. And this is exactly what has happened since then. In the few years of its existence, XML has been the basis for numerous  approximately 500  language deﬁnitions, some of which are covered in this book. There is probably  not  one  single  human  being—except  perhaps  Robin  Cover  www.oasis-open.org cover  —who has an overview of all XML-based lan- guage deﬁnitions.  In  this  context,  some  commentators  have  talked  of  “Babelization.” This is, in fact, what this plethora of languages looks like at ﬁrst sight. To understand what is going on, we have to take a deeper look into human nature in general.  1.1.4 Subcultures and Ontologies  You have probably already guessed it: the Bible is right—Babel belongs to the human condition  Figure 1.2 . Although English has become a world language, it is hard to say which English is the world language. One word processor lists the following ﬂavors: English  Australia , English  Belize , English   Great  Britain ,  English   Ireland ,  English   Jamaica ,  English  Canada , English  Caribbean , English  New Zealand , English  Philip- pines , English  South Africa , English  Trinidad , English  USA , English  Zimbabwe . This doesn’t mean that a reader of English  USA  necessarily understands what a writer of English  USA  has written—not if they be- long to different scientiﬁc communities or different trades. Medical sci- entists  speak  a  different  language  than  nuclear  scientists,  and  their vocabulary  vastly  differs  from  that  used  by  social  scientists,  computer programmers, or butchers.  In the world of the Internet, XML can play a similar role as a univer- sal language. It acts as a common substrate on which different special- purpose languages can be developed. Some of the 500 XML-based lan- guages exist because they serve speciﬁc purposes—for example, SMIL for   8  Chapter 1 Scenario  Y  F L  M  A  E  T  Figure 1.2 Architecture that didn’t work—the Tower of Babel.  multimedia  presentations  and  VoiceXML  for  speech  processing.  Others came into existence for the simple reason of competition: some manufac- turer wanted to stake a claim in the virtual world of e-business.  Is this really so bad? We don’t think so. The existence of 500 XML- based languages is not a sign of confusion; it simply shows that XML has made its way into many different application areas.  Later we will see that the deﬁnition of an XML-based language can be compared to the deﬁnition of a database schema: both deﬁne an ontol- ogy, a—albeit narrow—concept of the world. As virtually each enterprise and each organization fosters its own database schema, there would be millions of “languages” to learn if we were to try to exchange data on a bilateral basis between two companies using relational technology. This has been more or less the approach of classic EDI  electronic data inter- change . EDI worked well in some subcultures of the IT community, such as the automotive industry, however, only on a bilateral basis.  But this approach does not work on the Internet: the number of agree- ments between partners rises astronomically, and the process of negotia- tion is too slow. What is needed in electronic business are standards that apply to a whole community of prospective partners. Within the last few years, such standards have been developed by industry associations and interest groups. Horizontal standards  i.e., standards that apply to certain tasks like procurement or product data exchange  have been developed  Team-Fly®   1.1 Megapolis Internet  9  One language for all?  by IT companies and universities. These standards act as unifying forces across the various industries. In contrast, vertical standards, used within an industry, divide the Web into subcultures, such as the automotive in- dustry, the health industry, librarians, museums, and so on. Each of these subcultures nurtures its own ontology; that is, it uses a certain vocabulary and thinks in certain associations and contexts.  So why not use one language for all? The answer is simple:    Complexity. A language able to express any topic in the world would be so complex that nobody could deﬁne it, nobody could agree upon it, nobody could implement it, and nobody could learn it.    Responsiveness. The world is moving fast, especially the world of elec- tronic business. Adapting a one-for-all language to ever-changing re- quirements would require a constant change of this language, making development with such a language almost impossible.  It is, therefore, a misconception to understand XML as the language for all. We should rather see XML as a core technology for the implementa- tion of special-purpose languages and document schemata. Within Inter- net and electronic business, XML can play a similar role as SQL did for re- lational databases. In contrast to SQL, the scope of XML goes far beyond data storage and also covers domains such as communication, presenta- tion, process control, and navigation.  1.1.5 Challenges  The Internet poses new challenges for software developers and software architects alike—challenges that, if they existed in a closed enterprise sce- nario, would play only a minor role there.  Communication The ability to communicate across company borders is essential for future enterprise IT systems. This includes communication not only with other businesses but also with consumers and administration. New technolo- gies like mobile computing and embedded systems extend the reach of corporate IT systems. Typical-use cases include supply chain integration, health system integration, remote monitoring  vending machines, home appliances, industrial equipment , trafﬁc control, and others.  Service-Oriented Architecture The traditional integration of enterprise services via EDI happened to be hardwired  and  manual.  Establishing  a  new   bilateral   EDI  relationship   10  Chapter 1 Scenario  Loose coupling  Semantic networks and Semantic Web  between  partners  was  a  lengthy  and  expensive  process.  Within  enter- prises,  however,  more  advanced  IT  technologies  evolved.  Component technologies like CORBA allowed the integration of software components in a ﬂexible and dynamic way. Services offered by components could be published within a network. Other components could discover these ser- vices and establish a binding to them.  On  the  Internet  these  techniques  proved  to  be  too  tightly  coupled. Emerging XML-based standards such as SOAP  see Section 6.5.2 , WSDL  Section 6.6.3 , UDDI  Section 7.3 , and ebXML  Section 10.3  were intro- duced to allow for a loosely coupled, service-oriented architecture. Typi- cal  Web  services  include  credit  card  validation,  shipping,  fulﬁllment, marketplaces, mediation, brokerage, and so on.  Knowledge Retrieval XML-based formats like RDF  Resource Description Framework  and XTM  XML Topic Maps  allow the modeling of semantic networks  see Chap- ters 4 and 7 . Topic maps especially have become a core technology for content  management  solutions,  while  RDF  is  seen  by  the  W3C  as  the basis  for  the  construction  of  the  future  Semantic  Web   Berners-Lee 1998a .  Navigation The  chaotic  nature  of  the  Internet  requires  powerful  navigation  tools. Knowledge retrieval technologies will aid end users and software agents in  ﬁnding  the  target  destination.  Similar  technologies,  based  on  RDF, topic  maps,  and  directory  services   see  Section  7.3 ,  will,  for  example, allow manufacturers to locate possible suppliers for a product or service.  Mediation The existence of hundreds of different subcultures on the Web, and also the existence of millions of legacy systems, requires powerful mediation services.  Already  existing  are  XML  processors  that  are  able  to  hook  up with relational databases and to map XML document types to relational schemata.  Similar  services  can  mediate  between  different  XML  dialects and schemata.  Flexibility and Responsiveness The Internet changes every day. New sites are connected to the Internet; new  technologies  and  standards  are  introduced  in  short  order.  This requires  a  software  architecture  that  is  ﬂexible  enough  to  incorporate   1.1 Megapolis Internet  11  Soft-coded business rules  Long-running processes  new, and even previously unknown, technologies. The classical develop- ment cycles of months and even years are out of the question: it must be possible to make changes to business rules effective almost instantly.  The  traditional  way  to  implement  business  rules—hardwired  within program code—will certainly continue to exist in legacy code. For new developments  it  will  give  way  to  “soft-coded”  business  rules—business rules that are formulated in some description language, possibly an XML- based description language  see Chapter 5 . Business rules coded that way are easy to change and to deploy and can even be exchanged between applications.  Similarly, the navigational structures will cease to be hard-coded  i.e., links in HTML pages  but will give way to soft-coding techniques using RDF  see Section 3.3 , topic maps  Section 7.2 , or XLink linkbases  Sec- tion 7.1 .  Process Model The backbone of classical enterprise applications is the database transac- tion. Although the transaction model works well in applications that are orchestrated by human operators and with transactions spanning only a short time  milliseconds to a few seconds , it does not work well for auto- mated business processes that span a longer time, from a few hours to even years. These long-running processes are typically found in electronic business  applications,  enterprise  application  integration,  and  workﬂow systems  see Chapter 5 . They must be persistent  i.e., survive a system crash  or  shutdown ,  be  portable   which  rules  out  proprietary  formats , and  offer  the  possibility  of  compensating  actions   e.g.,  canceling  an order .  Several  proprietary  formats  to  describe  business  processes  have been developed, some of them based on XML. The deﬁnition of a com- mon standard is still an issue.  Autonomy Applications in electronic business have to organize business processes autonomously. Human operators can be called in for certain tasks or for assistance, but they no longer drive the process. Business processes must be able to modify themselves, for example, when a change in environ- ment conditions is detected, when new services are discovered, when the best  option  is  temporarily  not  available,  or  when  new  intelligence  is gained on how a certain goal may be achieved. For example, a sales agent may react intelligently when the market situation changes  e.g., change prices or move to a different marketplace .   12  Chapter 1 Scenario  Trusted Information Sources and Traceability Since anybody can publish information on the Internet, the information found there is sometimes not trustworthy. Systems that rely on informa- tion found on the Internet, such as agents, knowledge retrieval systems, intelligent search systems, or self-modifying processes, must be able to distinguish  between  “hard”   trusted   and  “soft”  information  sources. Mediation systems and knowledge processors must be able to trace back and reveal on what basis a certain result was obtained.  1.2 IMPLICATIONS  In the following sections we’ll discuss some of the implications of XML technology on the current IT landscape.  1.2.1 The Blurring of the Classical Application  On  the  Web  the  classical  stand-alone  application  vanishes.  Electronic business applications turn more and more into temporary and changing constellations of Web services. Single instances on the Web provide low- order services such as authentication, credit card validation, directory ser- vices, mediation services, logistics, and so on. Higher-order services such as  a  whole  business  process  invoke  these  lower-order  services—in  se- quence or simultaneously.  Web  services  are  currently  the  catchphrase,  most  notably  since  Mi- crosoft announced its .NET initiative. As we have just pointed out, Web services can act as building blocks for business processes, and all major developments in this area, such as BizTalk, RosettaNet, or ebXML, pro- vide  a  way  to  express  the  orchestration  of  business  processes  via  XML  Chapters 10 and 11 .  Using the Web as an infrastructure for interaction will change the na- ture of the Web itself. We are used to the Web as a huge library of hyper- linked documents.  Try www.shibumi.org eoti.htm for the ultimate link.  Since the beginning of the Web, these documents have become more col- orful, more animated, and interactive. However, the essential character of the Web stayed the same: it is a library, consisting of  relatively  few servers and an overwhelming mass of clients. The Web of the future will consist  of  a  huge  mass  of  whatever-the-name-will-bes,  combining  the functionality  of  servers  and  clients.  These  units  will  host  active  and autonomous objects  or agents  that interact with each other in a peer- to-peer  P2P  fashion. Maybe we will still call the Web “the Web” then,  Web services   1.2 Implications  13  but we also might call it “the Brain.” We will look into P2P technology in Section 7.4.  1.2.2 Collaboration Instead of Integration  Although  at  the  end  of  the  1990s  “enterprise  application  integration” became the catchphrase of the IT industry, it now is becoming more and more obvious that integration is not what the industry really needs. An enterprise  with  a  tightly  integrated  IT  infrastructure   such  as,  for  ex- ample,  a  huge  ERP  system   in  the  e-business  world  would  be  about  as maneuverable as a big oil tanker in a yacht regatta.  Building ad hoc business relationships or setting up virtual enterprises for speciﬁc business models does not require integration but collaboration between autonomous partners. More often than not, collaboration with external partners has proved to be more productive than cooperation be- tween internal departments, so much so that the principle of collaborat- ing autonomous work units is now even applied within the enterprise. The traditional hierarchical enterprise structure has given way to a more democratic model.  The  consequences  for  XML  architectures  are  that  we  don’t  have  to think in terms of megaprojects, but in terms of medium-sized applica- tions and specialized Web services with an open communication struc- ture.  XML  with  its  extensibility  allows  for  such  loosely  coupled,  open communication structures.  1.2.3 The Return of AI  Many  techniques  related  to  XML  remind  us  of  techniques  developed when artiﬁcial intelligence  AI  became an issue in the 1980s. Techniques such as rule-based programming  e.g., in XSLT , semantic networks  e.g., with topic maps , agent technology, and reasoning on the Semantic Web can draw on experiences had during this period when expert systems and programming in logic comprised the latest hype.  This makes sense, indeed. As the Web becomes more complex every day,  AI  methods  become  more  necessary  to  successfully  navigate  the Web, publish and discover business services, negotiate protocols, or me- diate between different ontologies.  1.2.4 Soft Logic  Moving  around  and  making  business  in  the  megapolis  Internet  re- quires—as we pointed out—some intelligence. Other than in the closed  No megaprojects!   14  Chapter 1 Scenario  world  of  the  enterprises’  information  systems,  we  experience  on  the Internet very diverse environments and conditions. The context of opera- tion frequently changes. Software systems must be able to negotiate this change of contexts. We will discuss this in detail in Section 4.4.  It requires, too, that systems have the ability to compromise. In many cases  it  might  not  be  possible  to  obtain  the  best  solution.  This  could have technical reasons, for example, when a server is down. Or it could have business reasons, when for example a supplier is booked up by the competition. In this case, an automated system must be able to go for a good solution instead of the best solution  wait for the server to go up again or search for another supplier .  In other cases, the distinction between “required” and “should” is by design in order to achieve a certain normative behavior without impos- ing restrictions that are too harsh. Administrations  such as customs or environment control  usually have rules and laws that must be enforced and others that should be enforced. If we model such behavior into soft- ware agents, we end up with systems that can negotiate and ﬁnd com- promises   Raskin  and  Tan  1996 .  Then  it  is  time  to  talk  about  ethics for computers.  Just  see  John  McCarthy’s  novel  The  Robot  and  the  Baby  McCarthy 2001 .  1.3 ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS  At the time of writing, XML has already made the transition from “if” to “how.” It is no longer a question if corporations and software manufac- turers will employ XML to provide solutions, but it is still very much a question how this  can  be  done.  Often  the  methodology  to  be  used  is unclear, and the available tools and infrastructure are still scarce and do not have the same maturity as, for example, relational technology.  The biggest problem is the human factor. Today, software engineers in the ﬁeld of XML come from three directions: from the SGML camp, from the object-oriented camp, and from the relational camp. We can there- fore expect—and, indeed, we do experience—that techniques and skills learned in these ﬁelds will be employed in the new ﬁeld of XML. This will occasionally result in frictions and misunderstandings, but it is not really bad. Eventually the technological crossover will breed a new discipline of design and programming, of which we now only see a glimpse.  This  requires  an  attitude  of  learning  mutually  from  each  other  and opening the mind to new ideas. Members of the SGML camp, for exam- ple, who are used to a more document-centric design style, will have to   1.3 Architectural Patterns  15  adapt  to  the  more  data-centric  style.  They  will  also  ﬁnd  that  concepts such as entity relationship modeling and referential integrity are exciting new ﬁelds where there remains a lot to do. Members of the SQL camp, in contrast, will miss concepts of referential integrity in XML but will ﬁnd that the rich structuring possibilities that exist in XML open a whole new world of database design. Finally members of the object-oriented camp will sadly miss a behavior model in XML documents. On the other hand, they may ﬁnd it exciting that XML actually does make remote procedure calls work across company, platform, and language boundaries.  This situation is also the reason why this book goes a bit deeper into theory than usual. In the current situation, where none of the existing design methods exactly ﬁts the new technology, it can be beneﬁcial to take a close look at the science.  But before we do this, let’s take a look at some applications and struc- tures  that  have  already  been  built  with  XML.  In  the  following  two sections we will list a few popular architectural patterns. As our earlier metaphor  of  the  unplanned  settlement  suggests,  we  will  structure  this overview into the sections “Dwellings” and “Community Infrastructure.” What you will not ﬁnd in this book is a blueprint for a large-scale ap- plication  based  on  XML.  Another  large-scale  application  would  be  the last thing we would want to build with XML. We do not need another Tower of Babel, and we do not need another XML-iﬁed ERP technology. What we do need is for ERP manufacturers to open up their packages and make the functions available as Web services—with the help of XML. In fact, this is what they currently do.  1.3.1 Dwellings  In this section we present a few architectural patterns that could be com- pared with a single dwelling, the typical “family home.” They are applica- tions that either operate within an enterprise or organization or somehow showcase the enterprise to the outside world. Usually these applications follow the classical client-server architecture, which typically consists of three tiers: a database tier, a middle tier, and a presentation tier.  Patterns  Catalogues This pattern is used for catalogues of all kinds, in particular for product catalogues.  The database  tier consists  of  a  native  XML  database  storing  product data in XML format or of a relational database containing product data and an XML wrapping layer.  Three tiers   16  Chapter 1 Scenario  Web Browser HTML XHTML  Mobile WAP  Print Media  PDF  eBook Formats  Multimedia  SMIL  X X  S S  L L  T T       J J  a a v v a a S S e e  rvlets rvlets  Vector Graphics  SVG  Catalogue  XML  Data  Speech  VoiceXML  Figure 1.3 A transformation layer converts presentation-neutral catalogue data into a variety of presentation formats.  The representation tier consists of client software, typically Web brows- ers that are equipped with suitable multimedia plug-ins. The formats used here  are  HTML  or  XHTML  combined  with  XML-based  multimedia  for- mats such as SVG and SMIL. Alternative clients are mobile, WAP-enabled devices, eBook devices, or even plain old telephones that are driven via VoiceXML.  Between  these  two  tiers  exists  a  transformation  tier,  typically  imple- mented in the form of XSLT style sheets, Java servlets, and or Java Server Pages  JSP  that transform the presentation-neutral product data into the required presentation format  Figure 1.3 .  Encyclopedias This pattern can, as a matter of fact, be used to implement online ency- clopedias, but it is also applicable to other forms of knowledge bases, any- where that navigation structures are required that are independent from   1.3 Architectural Patterns  17  Figure 1.4 The navigation layer separates navigation from presentation and content.  the physical layout of the data. It can be used to apply sophisticated nav- igation techniques to whole Web sites, product catalogues, Web shops, and so on. It allows the establishment of semantic relationships between Web resources and can provide additional access structures to users such as links, paths, indices, taxonomies, guided tours, and so on.  It  adds  a  separate  navigational  layer  that  is  independent  from  the physical structure of the knowledge base  Figure 1.4 . The separate navi- gation  tier  can  be  implemented  with  technologies  such  as  topic  maps, RDF, or XLink linkbases. This allows for easy modiﬁcation of navigation structures  without  touching  the  actual  resources  or  the  representation logic. It also easily allows the implementation of different navigational structures for different types of users.  Soft-coded navigation tier   18  Chapter 1 Scenario  Orchestration  In  combination  with  the  catalogue  pattern,  different  presentation  forms are possible.  Workﬂow System While the previous two patterns leave the initiative to the end user, the workﬂow  pattern  orchestrates  the  work  tasks  for  a  single  end  user  or multiple end users. However, workﬂows can react to user events, thus leaving  a  controlled  part  of  the  initiative  with  the  end  user.  Typical applications are shopping systems, supply chain integration, and con- tent management.  The  workﬂow  pattern  again  consists  of  an  XML  database  tier   XML repository  storing not only the resources and artifacts of the work pro- cess, but also the description of the workﬂow itself.  The workﬂow tier  Figure 1.5  consists of a workﬂow engine interpret- ing the workﬂow description, which is typically formulated in XML. De- pending  on  the  state  of  the  workﬂow,  certain  resources  or  artifacts  are presented to the user for viewing or editing.  M  F L  Y  In  combination  with  the  catalogue  pattern,  different  presentation  forms are possible.  A real world example of the application of this pattern is discussed in Ahmed  2001 . This content management system was designed for the Society of Automotive Engineers  SAE  to automate their standards devel- opment process. The system supports online browsing of documents in HTML or PDF format, online change request authoring, online workﬂow support for change request approval  including an electronic ballot pro- cess , keyword searches, and browsing in archives.  A  E  T  1.3.2 Community Infrastructure  The  infrastructure  of  the  online  community  is  constituted  of  facilities that  are  provided  for  public  use  such  as  libraries,  directories,  market- places, and other Web services. These facilities are provided by institu- tions, enterprises, or individuals. They may be free to use, or they may be available for a fee.  Typically such infrastructures are provided on the Internet, but intra- nets  and  extranets  may  also  offer  such  facilities  for  their  respective communities.  Libraries Libraries are the oldest institutions on the Web. In fact, the Web can be seen as one huge library. This was facilitated by standard protocol formats  Team-Fly®   1.3 Architectural Patterns  19  Figure 1.5 The workﬂow layer orchestrates tasks and services.  such  as  TCP IP,  HTTP,  and  HTML  and  the  integration  of  the  necessary access software  TCP IP stack, Web browsers  into operating systems.  Web Services The introduction of Web services marks a paradigm shift for the Inter- net—the conversion from a huge document base into an interconnected network  of  clients,  agents,  and  applications.  A  Web  service  is  such  an application  usually with a specialized functionality . The service can be invoked from a client or from another Web service  Figure 1.6 . The invo- cation can be of a simple request response type, or it can have a more complex protocol consisting of several messages exchanged. In Chapter 10 we discuss Web services in more detail.   20  Chapter 1 Scenario  SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI  Figure 1.6 Distributed functionality: a call to Web services can cascade through several service providers somewhere on the Internet.  Web services are based on three technological standards: SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI  see Chapters 6 and 7 ; all of them are XML applications. SOAP deﬁnes the transport format, WSDL is used to describe Web service access points and protocols, and UDDI is used for the registration and discovery of Web services in directories.  In the context of its .NET architecture, Microsoft has included SOAP in their Windows operating system, thus allowing any Windows application to use Web services. To give a simple example: a spreadsheet application could use a Web service for currency conversion, thus always ensuring that the current conversion rate is used.  Marketplaces Marketplaces bring buyers and sellers together  Figure 1.7 . They include functionality  such  as  product  catalogue  integration,  content  manage-   1.3 Architectural Patterns  21  Marketplace  Figure 1.7 The marketplace acts as a single point of access for buyers and sellers.  ment for product catalogues, query routing, vocabulary matching, shared ontologies, communication with other marketplaces, and so on.  Marketplaces  can  offer  additional  services  such  as  order  acquisition, fulﬁllment, clearing, settlement, or payment ﬂow. They also attract third- party services such as buyer cooperatives, logistics, ﬁnancial services, re- searchers, directory services, and industry associations.  Advanced  marketplaces  offer  support  for  business  processes  beyond pure  procurement.  For  example,  they  may  provide  services  for  supply chain management and shared product development.  Portals A portal serves as an entry point to an Internet community, a large enter- prise,  an  online  market,  and  so  on.  The  portal  aggregates  information from  several  sources  and  personalizes  the  presentation  for  each  user according to his or her preferences and role.  Portals also attract third-party services such as directory services, in-  dustry associations, trade publications, and news feeds.  Repositories Repositories  are  used  to  register  Web  services,  business  partners,  and other resources. A service provider that wants to offer a particular Web   22  Chapter 1 Scenario  Finding a partner and services  Repository  Figure 1.8 Clients use a repository as an “introduction agency,” then communicate on a peer-to-peer basis.  service can register the Web service with a UDDI directory  see Chapter 7 . Clients that look for a particular Web service can query that directory to ﬁnd it.  Similarly a company that wants to engage in electronic business can register with an ebXML repository  see Chapter 10  and store its company proﬁle. Another company looking for a partner can query the repository. After ﬁnding a prospective partner in the repository it can negotiate the details directly with this partner  Figure 1.8 .  Repositories  can  also  act  as  libraries  for  shared  resources  such  as common business objects, vocabularies, and other schemata. They may offer  extra  services  for  adapting  generic  resources  to  local  or  industry conventions.  1.4 BEST PRACTICES  The  following   very  general   principles  apply  when  designing  systems that are ﬂexible, open, and collaborative.   1.4 Best Practices  23    Reiﬁcation. Instead of hard-coding relationships between entities and process dynamics  business rules  within your application, model these relationships as entities  see Section 3.2.2  and implement them in the form of XML documents, a process that, in terms of logic, can be seen as reiﬁcation.  Reiﬁcation = “to make into a thing.”   Construct generic software that is able to interpret these documents. That  way  it  will  be  much  easier  to  adapt  your  applications  when changes become necessary. Hard-coded business rules are at the core of EDI’s inﬂexibility.    Context awareness. Instead of constructing the same software modules  and document schemata  again and again, construct generic software modules  and  document  schemata  that  are  context  aware  and  can adapt to different contexts. An example is the deﬁnition of business objects in ebXML  actually this is something learned from EDI .    Autonomy. Instead  of  constructing  huge  applications  and  similarly huge  document  schemata,  construct  small  specialized  units  that  do what they can do best, but that also can collaborate with others. This also means that the deﬁnition of basic units should be fairly complete, specifying  not  only  data  structure  but  also  semantics  and  behavior. While agent technology may not yet be mature enough for produc- tion, a lot can already be learned from this technology. We believe that over time XML will move in this direction. XML schemata will allow the  deﬁnition  of  self-contained  objects  that  exhibit  a  behavior  and that control their own life cycle.    2Groundwork  2.1 XML: A Language  Factory  Stylesheet Language   derived  from  SGML   DTD ,  then  discuss  the  now-released  2.2 XML Basics  2.3  2.4  Schema Deﬁnition— Stage 1  Schema Deﬁnition— Stage 2  2.5 Access and  Composition  2.6 Querying XML  2.7 XSL  Extensible  2.8 XML APIs  2.9  Schema Deﬁnition— Stage 3  2.10 Best Practices  2.11 XML Resources  This chapter introduces most of the basic standards for  XML. If you are familiar with the syntax and the infor-  mation model of XML, you can skip Section 2.2. If you are  new to XML or need to refresh your memory, you will ﬁnd  this chapter helpful.  Schema deﬁnition is the subject of a long  and ongoing   debate  in  the  XML  community.  We  introduce  its  origins,  W3C  recommendation  XML  Schema.  We  will  pick  up  the  schema thread again in Section 2.9, where we discuss tech-  niques  that  go  beyond  XML  Schema  such  as  Schematron,  architectural forms, and design patterns.  In  between  we  discuss  several  standards  that  deﬁne  ac-  cess to documents, document composition, and document  transformation, including XPath, XPointer, XInclude, XBase,  25   26  Chapter 2 Groundwork  XML’s history  The roots  of XML  Special-purpose languages  XQuery,  XSL,  and  the  SAX  and  DOM  APIs  that  allow  access  to  document structures from programming languages. Please note that document trans- formation  including XSLT  is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.  The  XML  recommendation   Bray,  Paoli,  and  Sperberg-McQueen  1998  was released in 1998 by the World Wide Web Consortium  the W3C . Ini- tially the adoption of XML by the Internet community was quite slow— because  of  a  misconception.  By  many  XML  was  seen  as  a  successor  to HTML. When it became clear that this was not the case  although XML deals with some of the deﬁciencies of HTML , but that XML is good for anything  else  but  Web  pages,  things  started  to  move.  The  adoption  of XML  by  industry  heavyweights  such  as  IBM,  Microsoft,  Sun,  SAP,  and Software AG gave massive momentum to XML.  The initial proposal for XML was based on an already existing standard called the Standard Generalized Markup Language  SGML . SGML had its immediate  origins  in  1986,  but  its  roots  go  back  well  into  the  1960s, when at IBM Charles Goldfarb, Edward Mosher, and Raymond Lorie de- ﬁned the Generalized Markup Language  GML . Is it by accident or by in- tention that this acronym also matches the initials of its three inventors? The domain of SGML lies in document processing—for example, book publishing. SGML is incredibly powerful but is also very complex—too complex to be used on the Web. The speciﬁcation alone has more than 500 pages. The XML working group cut this down to 26 pages while keep- ing about 95% of the SGML functionality, in the process also depriving Goldfarb of his initial. Goldfarb took revenge and wrote one of the best books about XML  Goldfarb and Prescod 2000 . This time he needed only 900 pages.  2.1 XML: A LANGUAGE FACTORY  The main purpose of XML seems to be to spawn other languages. By the end  of  2000  there  existed  about  500  XML-based  special-purpose  lan- guages. Some of these are domain oriented  vertical  and deﬁne exchange formats within an industry sector or another community. Others are task oriented  horizontal  and act as global languages for speciﬁc technical or application-oriented  tasks,  such  as  service  description,  procurement, product  life  cycle  management,  and  so  on.  For  an  overview  of  such industry languages, see Section 10.4.  Although, at ﬁrst sight, this might look a bit dazzling, this situation has its beneﬁts. There is a special-purpose language for almost any pur-   2.2 XML Basics  27  pose. Because the base technology is the same for all these languages— namely, XML—the learning curve for each of these languages is short: in most cases it’s only a few new tags and attributes that must be learned. The other advantage is that these languages can be processed with the same basic tools. Transformations between these different languages can be achieved by simple means such as XSLT style sheets  XSLT is an XML- based language for document transformation . For example, it is possible to query an XML database with an XQuery or XPath search expression for product information. The result would be an XML document that de- scribes the product in a transformation-neutral format. This document can be transformed with an XSLT style sheet into presentation formats such as XHTML, SMIL, WML, or even VoiceXML. Or the data could be packed into a SOAP message and sent to a business partner. Or we could compile sales ﬁgures and display them with the help of SVG, an XML- based vector graphics standard.  All  of  these  acronyms  denote  XML-based  special-purpose  languages. We will discuss each in more detail in later chapters. At the moment, it is only important to know that all of these languages are based on XML. As in many cases, here, too, the whole is more than the sum of its parts.  2.2 XML BASICS  There are already many books about XML on the market, including the one by Charles Goldfarb and Paul Prescod mentioned earlier  Goldfarb and  Prescod  2000 .  We  will  therefore  explain  the  basic  XML  concepts here only brieﬂy.  2.2.1 The Syntax  The XML syntax rules deﬁne the “well-formedness” of XML documents. “Well-formed” means that a document is syntactically correct. Any well- formed XML document can be processed with a standard XML parser.  Markup XML is a markup language—a document can be structured with the help of syntactical markup elements, similar to those used in HTML. Identi- ﬁable elements within a document are enclosed between start and end tags:   Goldfarb   Tags   28  Chapter 2 Groundwork  In contrast to HTML, a start tag must always have a corresponding end tag.  We are talking here of classic HTML. The new XHTML standard is based on XML, so the strict XML syntax rules apply for XHTML as well.  For empty elements there is a shorthand notation. Instead of writing  the canonical form   , we can write  .  Also in contrast to HTML, upper and lower case does matter:    Attributes  Elements can be decorated with attributes:  is different from  .  Multilingual documents  Y   The XML-Handbook™   Das XML-Handbuch   Attributes consist of a name and a value. Unlike HTML, an attribute must always have a value, and the value must always be enclosed in single or double quotes. The attribute we have used here is one of the few prede- ﬁned attributes in XML  indicated by the namespace preﬁx xml: . Conse- quently,  this  preﬁx  is  forbidden  for  user-deﬁned  attributes   including preﬁxes such as XML:, xML:, Xml:, etc. .  F L  M  This particular attribute deﬁnes the language of an element. The value of the attribute consists of a combination of language code and country code.  The  language  code  follows  ISO639   www.w3.org WAI ER IG ert  iso639.htm ,  while  the  country  code  is  the  same  as  that  used  for  Web domain  addresses.  Using  this  attribute  it  is  easy  to  create  multilingual documents, as shown in the following example.  T  E  A  Using markup, it is possible to create documents of an arbitrarily com-  plex structure:      The XML-Handbook™   Das XML-Handbuch            Charles   F.   Goldfarb              Paul   Prescod   Team-Fly®   2.2 XML Basics  29            Note that by nesting elements our document is organized as a tree struc- ture. Compare this to the ﬂat relational tables: we would have needed at least three different tables to store such a data structure in a relational database.  Also note that the elements can be variable in layout. The ﬁrst author has a middle name; the second has only a ﬁrst and a last name. In a rela- tional table this would have been modeled with the rather artiﬁcial con- struct of a null value for the middle name of the second author.  Elements can contain an arbitrary mixture of subelements and text, a fact that can cause some headache when mapping XML structures onto object-oriented or relational structures. For example:  Mixed elements        The XML-Handbook™  Second Edition   XML declaration in its minimal form:     XML  documents  should  be  introduced  by  a  prolog,  at  least  with  an  Prolog  XML’s character set is Unicode, which allows XML to contain most of the international characters. The default character encodings are UTF-8 and UTF-16  Standard ASCII code is a subset of UTF-8 , but other code sys- tems can be speciﬁed with an XML declaration in the document prolog:  Encoding     Comments  are  inserted  into  XML  documents  using  the  following  Comments  syntax:     document.  That  is  basically  all  you  need  to  know  to  write  your  ﬁrst  XML  Extensibility The X in “XML” stands for “extensible,” which more or less means that you can introduce your own tags and attributes. And this is exactly the   30  Chapter 2 Groundwork  strength of XML. In HTML, in contrast, all tags and attributes are prede- ﬁned. Most of these tags are used for presentation purposes, and some are used for navigation. This is sufﬁcient for displaying nice Web pages but not for processing business data over the Internet. For a search engine, an agent, a partner application, or even a human reader, the markup  415- 555-1234  is quite meaningless. That this item will be printed in bold type  has  no  signiﬁcance  in  this  context.  More  important  would  be  to know what this number means. Is it a product number, a phone number, or  an  employee  number?  Markup  like   415-555-1234   is much more helpful here, and this is exactly what XML was designed for. By using this type of semantic markup, a document can be self-describing. In our earlier   document, for example, we can easily identify the title and the authors.  However,  it  was  not  the  goal  of  the  XML  designers  that  everybody would now start to invent their own tags and attributes as they please. The result would be total chaos, with nobody understanding each other’s documents. Instead, it was intended that user groups, industry associa- tions,  and  communities  would  get  together  and  agree  on  certain docu- ment types. By using a DOCTYPE instruction, an XML ﬁle can be tied to a given document type:     The DOCTYPE instruction must be given within the document prolog, after the XML speciﬁcation. This instruction is not mandatory, but if it is supplied, a validating parser can check the document structure against the speciﬁed Document Type Deﬁnition  DTD . We will discuss DTDs in more detail shortly. At the moment, it is sufﬁcient to know that a DTD deﬁnes the vocabulary  tag and attribute names  and the structure of doc- uments. A document with a DOCTYPE declaration that conforms with the speciﬁed document type is called valid.  It is important to know that even documents with a speciﬁed docu- ment type remain extensible. The external DTD deﬁnes only the minimal layout  of  a  document.  It  is  always  possible  to  add  additional  elements  and text  to such a document by extending the external DTD with a lo- cal DTD subset  for an example, see Section 2.9.3 . This allows users to use standard DTDs but add custom elements for individual purposes. This ﬂexibility makes it easier for users to adopt existing standards.  Namespaces Extensibility, however, creates some problems. When tag names can be created at will, it is very likely that the same tag names will be used by  Document type   2.2 XML Basics  31  Namespace URI  different people for different purposes. This is normally not a problem as long as documents are kept apart. But when documents are merged, or modularized document types are combined, there can be name clashes. For  example,  in  an  XSLT  style  sheet  that  transforms  document  A  into document B, we need to decorate the tags used for the XSLT control ele- ments in order to differentiate them from the tags in the processed docu- ments  see Chapter 9 .  This is done with namespaces. You could compare a namespace to a city or a township. There may be a Marine Parade in both Sydney and Melbourne. By decorating the street name “Marine Parade” with a city name, you can uniquely identify the street.  In  XML,  namespaces   Bray,  Hollander,  and  Layman  1999   are  repre- sented  by  a  URI   Uniform  Resource  Identiﬁer —either  a  URL   Uniform Resource Locator  or a URN  Uniform Resource Name . Such identiﬁers are constructed from a registered domain name, owned by the author, and an arbitrary path expression. It is important to use a registered do- main  name  and  not  some  fantasy  name,  since  only  registered  domain names are globally unique.  However, in the examples in this book we use fantasy names.  The path name is used to differentiate between sev- eral namespaces deﬁned by the domain owner. With this technique, any- body  who  owns  a  registered  domain  name  can  create  as  many  name- spaces as he or she likes.  Namespaces  can  be  used  within  a  document  in  two  ways,  de- fault namespaces  and  preﬁxes.  First  we  will  look  at  an  example  of  a default namespace:      The XML-Handbook™    ...       In this example all tags in the book element now belong to namespace http:   www.books.org computer xml.  It  is  also  possible  to  scope  name- spaces:      The XML-Handbook™    ...        32  Chapter 2 Groundwork  Now the   element and all child elements belong to a different namespace, http:  www.books.org authors. Now let’s look at an example of preﬁxes:      The XML-Handbook™    ...       Preﬁxes can be chosen arbitrarily and are used as a shorthand notation for the full namespace speciﬁcation. By combining the preﬁx with a tag name  we  have  assigned  only  the  tag    to  the  namespace http:  www.books.org authors. The child elements would still belong to the  default  namespace  http:  www.books.org computer xml,  unless  we preﬁx them with a:, too.  Advanced Topics CDATA provides a way to denote text as unparsed character data:  <![CDATA[  ]]>  if ThisYear < 100  ThisYear+=1900;   CDATA is especially useful when you want to place some program code into an XML element, or if you want an element to contain marked-up text but want the markup to be treated as plain text. CDATA advises XML processors not to parse the included text for subelements.  XML documents can contain processing instructions, for example, to  specify the URI of an attached style sheet:      This  syntax  is  speciﬁed  in  an  extra  W3C  recommendation;  see  Clark 1999b.  This processing instruction indicates to a Web browser that the document should not be displayed in its native form but should be trans- formed with the referenced style sheet and that the result of that trans- formation should be displayed.  Document  text  can  contain  predeﬁned  entity  references.  These  are used to substitute characters that are otherwise used in a special syntactic role  see Table 2.1 . For example:    3&gt;2    Processing instructions  Entities   2.2 XML Basics  33  Table 2.1  Character Entities in XML.  Character  Entity  & “ ‘ < >  &amp; &quot; &apos; &lt; &gt;  Similarly, character references can be used. Characters can be speciﬁed as decimal code numbers or as hexadecimal code numbers. For example, both &169; and &xA9; denote the copyright character.  In addition, user-deﬁned entities can be used. These must be declared in a DTD—either inline within the document or in the external DTD  see Section 2.3.1 .1 For example:  &legal; &pi;  2.2.2 The XML Information Model  Before  we  discuss  the  standards  to  access  XML  structures  like  XBase, XPath, XPointer, XLink, and DOM, it is necessary to get a better under- standing of the XML data model, also called the XML information set. This is described in detail in Cowan and Tobin  2001 . The XML informa- tion  set  is  independent  of  the  actual  format  of  a  document:  the  docu- ment may exist in the form of an XML text ﬁle, a DOM tree, and so on.  All XML documents have a tree structure, with the nodes of the tree constituted of elements and attributes  see Figure 2.1 . Attributes are always leaf nodes; they do not have child nodes. Element nodes may have child nodes. All nodes except the root node have one parent node.  The attribute nodes of an element form an unordered list; that is, it is not possible to make statements about the order in which the attributes of an element occur. In contrast the child elements of an element form an ordered list. Consequently there is a positional order relation between the child elements of an element. This means that we can rely on the po- sition of an element when accessing parts of an XML document.  1 We are a bit sloppy here. To be correct, we have to speak of the “external DTD subset,” since a DTD can consist of an external subset and an internal subset.  Tree structure   34  Chapter 2 Groundwork  book  title+  authors  @ISBN  @xml:lang  author+  name  first_name  middle_name?  last_name  Figure 2.1 Structure of the   schema.   and   are marked with “+” to indicate multiple occurrences.   is marked with “?” to indicate that this element is optional. The attributes xml:lang and ISBN are preﬁxed with “@”, indicating an attribute. Although this ﬁgure shows a tree diagram, schema diagrams can be cyclic  recursive .  Namespace identiﬁer  Repetition  Each  node—element  or  attribute—has  a  local  name  and  can  have  a namespace identiﬁer. The local name  also the combination of local name and  namespace  identiﬁer   is  not  required  to  be  unique  within  a  docu- ment: elements and attributes may appear with the same name in differ- ent contexts  i.e., under different parent elements  in the document.2  Furthermore, elements can repeat within a context. In contrast, attri-  butes must not repeat within a context.  2.3 SCHEMA DEFINITION—STAGE 1  In this section, we take a look at schema deﬁnitions for XML. We begin with the basic DTD, as deﬁned in the XML V1.0 Recommendation.  2 This has consequences for the authoring of XML documents: it makes sense to always qualify elements with a namespace preﬁx but not to qualify attributes.   2.3 Schema Deﬁnition—Stage 1  35  2.3.1 The Document Type Deﬁnition  DTD  As we mentioned earlier, it is possible to classify XML documents into document  types.  This  is  achieved  with  a  DOCTYPE deﬁnition.  We  have already given an example of an external DOCTYPE deﬁnition:     However, it is also possible to specify an internal DOCTYPE deﬁnition af-  ter the document prolog:  <!DOCTYPE book [ . . . .  ]>  with the whole document type speciﬁcation contained within the brack- ets.  This  form,  however,  is  of  only  limited  use  because  the  so-deﬁned document type applies only to the current document. Normally a DTD is provided  as  an  external  ﬁle   which  may  be  extended  by  an  internal DOCTYPE deﬁnition .  Element Deﬁnition Let’s now see what can be speciﬁed within a DTD.          <!ATTLIST author   aid ID REQUIRED role  contributoreditor  “contributor”>          This could be a complete DTD for the earlier   example. We see that each element in the document has a corresponding ELEMENT declaration in  the  DTD.  This  declaration  speciﬁes  how  each  element  is  structured. The following element types are possible:  Element structure  ANY  The element can contain mixed content including character data and child elements. Denotes an empty element.  EMPTY PCDATA The element contains parsed character data.  Parsed char-  acter data must not contain characters such as “<” or “&”.  The element contains a model group  discussed below .   ...    36  Chapter 2 Groundwork  Model groups  Model groups are constructed by child elements used in sequence or as alternatives. Both operations may be nested to obtain complex structures:   child   child1,child2,...,childn   child1child2...childn   child1, child2 child3,child4  ,  Single child element Sequence of child elements Alternate child elements  child5   Complex child structure  Constraints  In addition, each element can be postﬁxed with a modiﬁer that denotes the number of occurrences  cardinality  of the element and whether the element is mandatory or optional:  No modiﬁer One occurrence, mandatory  1..1  ? + *  One occurrence, optional  0..1  Multiple occurrences, mandatory  0..n  Multiple occurrences, optional  1..n   Earlier we had deﬁned     because the element   can contain multiple   elements but must contain at least one of them. We had deﬁned     because the element   must contain the elements   and   but may contain the element  .  The  element  deﬁnitions  can  be  recursive,  meaning  that  a  child  ele- ment in a model group can refer to a previously deﬁned parent element.     <!ELEMENT section    title, content   abstract?,section+   >  This  deﬁnes  the  structure  of  book  chapters.  Each  chapter  consists  of  a mandatory title, an optional abstract, and multiple sections. Each section consists  of  a  mandatory  title,  followed  either  by  content  or  by  an optional abstract and multiple nested sections.  If  you  have  experience  in  the  deﬁnition  of  formal  languages,  you might  have  noticed  that  a  DTD  very  much  resembles  the  production rules of a formal language. To be precise, DTDs form a subclass of forest- regular grammars  FRG .  Recursion  Formal languages   2.3 Schema Deﬁnition—Stage 1  37  And, in fact, DTDs are used to deﬁne other XML-based languages. So there is an XHTML DTD, an SVG DTD, an SMIL DTD, an XSLT DTD, and so on.  Attribute Deﬁnition In a similar way, attributes can be deﬁned for each element. This is done using ATTLIST, which lists all attributes of an element. Each attribute def- inition  consists  of  an  attribute  name,  an  attribute  type,  and  a  default value.  In contrast to XML elements, which are typeless, attributes do have a  Attribute types  NMTOKENS  writereditorartist  Enumeration. Each token must be a valid  NOTATION  n1n2...   ID  Character data.

REQUIRED “fax”,”42”,”yes” Default values. These apply when the attribute is  FIXED “v1”   not speciﬁed. Fixed content. If speciﬁed, instances must match this value.  The  following  default  value  speciﬁcations  can  be  used  for  attribute  Default values   38  Chapter 2 Groundwork  Identiﬁers  NOTATION  In our earlier example we deﬁned  <!ATTLIST author   aid ID REQUIRED role  contributoreditor  “contributor”>  This means that the element   has a required attribute of type ID and an optional attribute role. If the attribute role is speciﬁed, it can take two  valid  values,  “contributor”  and  “editor”.  If  it  is  not  speciﬁed,  the default value “contributor” applies.  Y  F L  2.3.2 Advanced Topics  The ID and IDREF attribute types can be used to establish relations be- tween  elements,  allowing  the  establishment  of  networklike  document structures that could not be captured in tree structures. In particular, it is possible to deﬁne documents that model relational tables by using the ID and IDREF constructs. ID acts as a primary key, while IDREF acts as a for- eign key. Some XML parsers support the location of elements by ID.  M  The NOTATION attribute type is a kind of type extension mechanism for elements. A NOTATION attribute advises XML processors that the element to which the attribute is attached should contain content that complies with the speciﬁed notation. An XML processor could then check the ele- ment for speciﬁc content, possibly by using a helper application.  T  E  A  In practical applications the NOTATION construct is hardly used, espe- cially  now  that  there  are  better  ways  to  deﬁne  datatypes  for  XML  ele- ments with XML Schema. We will discuss this in Section 2.4.2.  Entities A DTD can declare user-deﬁned entities. These entities can be used within the document text and will be resolved to the entity deﬁnition by XML processors. User-deﬁned entities are used to abbreviate frequently used terms  and  phrases,  or  to  introduce  a  symbolic  notation  for  commonly needed constants:       A DTD can also deﬁne external entities—entities that do not specify a literal value within the DTD but refer to an external document. However, this is beyond the scope of this discussion. Especially in the context of message exchange and databases, we do not recommend the use of exter-  Team-Fly®   2.4 Schema Deﬁnition—Stage 2  39  nal entities. In traditional SGML environments, however, external enti- ties are widely used for document composition.  Parameter Entities Parameter  entities  are  used  only  within  a  DTD;  they  do  not  appear  in XML instances. A parameter entity is just an abbreviation for a string that is frequently used within a DTD and thus allows factoring out frequently used strings.  A parameter entity can be declared through     All occurrences of %entity-name; within the DTD will be substituted with string-value. It is possible to nest parameter entities.  2.4 SCHEMA DEFINITION—STAGE 2  In the past, DTDs were the standard way to deﬁne a schema for an XML document type. However, more than a dozen alternative schema deﬁni- tion languages have been created by several institutions and individuals. The  W3C  itself  has  produced  a  new  schema  deﬁnition  language,  XML Schema  XSD , which is discussed in Section 2.4.2.  2.4.1 DTD Deﬁciencies  The reason for the ﬂood of schema deﬁnition languages lies in the deﬁ- ciencies of the DTD:    Syntax: DTDs are not XML documents themselves. This is a problem because  the  ubiquitous  XML  tools  cannot  be  used  to  edit,  validate, parse, and transform DTDs.    Namespaces: DTDs  do  not  support  namespaces.  A  DTD  doesn’t  stop you  from  using  preﬁx:name combinations  for  element  and  attribute names, but it interprets these combinations as simple names. This can lead to confusion.    Datatypes: DTDs do not support datatypes in the classical sense. We cannot deﬁne, for example, elements and attributes that must be nu- meric or integer. The content of elements and the value of attributes are always  regarded  as  character  data.  This  can  have  unpleasant  ef- fects when we want to compare two elements that contain numeric   40  Chapter 2 Groundwork  values: “–1” is regarded as smaller than “–2”; the ﬂoating point num- ber “3.3e–10” is regarded as larger than “2.2e+16”; and so on.  Except  for  some  datatypes  for  attributes   such  as  NMTOKEN,  ID, IDREF, etc. , DTDs do not feature built-in datatypes. It is not possible to create user-deﬁned datatypes either.    Bags: DTDs cannot specify unordered sequences of elements  bags . For a given model group  e1,e2,e3  the elements e1 . . . e3 must appear in the document instance in the deﬁned sequence. To simulate an un- ordered sequence, all possible permutations must be given as alterna- tives:   e1,e2,e3    e1,e3,e2    e2,e1,e3   . . .  .    Context: In DTDs all elements are deﬁned on the document level. This makes  it  impossible  to  deﬁne  context-sensitive  elements—elements with the same name but with different structure in different contexts.   Cross-references: The support for cross-references in DTDs is poor. Only attribute values can be used as keys, and it is not possible to combine a key from several attributes. Keys are always deﬁned on the document level, so it is not possible to scope keys.  2.4.2 XML Schema  That was reason enough for the W3C to start with the deﬁnition of a new schema language. The XML Schema working draft was ﬁrst published in May 1999. It could already rely on several other schema languages such as  XSchema,  DDML,  XML-Data,  and  SOX   Schema  for  Object-oriented XML . One of the more recent additions was XDR, which was used by the BizTalk community for schema deﬁnition. Now, with the XML Schema recommendation  Fallside 2001  released in May 2001, most XML com- munities—including the BizTalk community—are moving toward XML Schema.  XML  Schema  is  quite  a  complex  standard.  To  begin  to  understand XML Schema, it is best to think of it in terms of DTDs + Namespaces + Datatypes and worry about the rest later. Because we have already cov- ered DTDs and namespaces, we will begin with datatypes.  Datatypes The introduction of a full type system  Biron and Malhotra 2001  for ele- ments  and  attributes  is  the  most  important  aspect  of  XML  Schema.  It includes the attribute types known from DTDs but also introduces basic datatypes  as  they  are  known  in  SQL  or  programming  languages.  User- deﬁned datatypes are possible, too.   2.4 Schema Deﬁnition—Stage 2  41  Value space and lexical space  Facets  Built-in Datatypes The type system of XML Schema makes a clear dis- tinction between value space and lexical space. While the value space is constituted of an abstract collection of valid values for a datatype, the lexical  space  contains  the  lexical  representation  of  these  values—the tokens that can appear in the XML document. Depending on the permit- ted formats, each value can have several lexical representations  see Fig- ure 2.2 .  XML  Schema  deﬁnes  datatypes  by  attributing  facets to  datatypes. Facets  deﬁne  single  properties  of  datatypes;  that  is,  the  deﬁnition  of  a datatype is made up of a collection of constituting facets. XML Schema differentiates between fundamental facets and constraining facets.  Fundamental  facets  deﬁne  the  basic  properties  of  datatypes.  Funda-  mental facets are:   equal  ordered bounded  Deﬁnes equality between values of a datatype. For example, two attributes are equal if their values  not necessarily their string representations  are equal. Deﬁnes order relations between values of a datatype. Deﬁnes upper and lower bounds for the values of a datatype.  cardinality Deﬁnes whether the value space of a datatype is ﬁnite, countably inﬁnite, or uncountably inﬁnite. For example,  Value Space  1999-W19-4  99-05-13  May 13, 1999  1999-05-13  1999-133  Lexical Space  Figure 2.2 Possible lexical representations for a given date value. Transformations between value space and lexical space are bidirectional: parsing operations transform lexical representations into values; formatting operations transform values into lexical representations.   42  Chapter 2 Groundwork  enumerations are ﬁnite and integer numbers are countably inﬁnite. Deﬁnes whether or not a datatype is numeric.  Constraining facets do not add new properties to a datatype but—as the  name  says—constrain  existing  fundamental  facets.  Constraining facets are  numeric  length  minLength maxLength pattern  enumeration  whiteSpace  maxInclusive maxExclusive minInclusive minExclusive totalDigits  Deﬁnes the length of a datatype value  number of characters for strings, number of octets for binary, etc. . For example, a country code such as us, de, uk, fr, and so on would have a ﬁxed length of 2. Lower bound for the length of a datatype value. Upper bound for the length of a datatype value. Constrains the values of a datatype by constraining the lexical space of a datatype to match a speciﬁed character pattern. A pattern is deﬁned via regular expressions. Example: ’[0-9]-[0-9] {3}-[0-9] {5}-[0-9]’ constrains the lexical space of a datatype to the format of an ISBN Constrains the value space of a datatype to a speciﬁed enumeration of values. Constrains the value space of a datatype by imposing a policy for whitespace handling: preserve  keep all whitespace characters , replace  replace each whitespace character with the blank character , collapse  reduce all sequences of whitespace characters with a single blank character . Upper bound for the value space of a datatype.  Lower bound for the value space of a datatype.  Maximum total number of decimal digits in values of datatypes derived from datatype decimal.  fractionDigits Maximum number of decimal digits in the fractional  part of values of datatypes derived from decimal.  Type hierarchy  Using  these  facets,  XML  Schema  deﬁnes  a  rich  set  of  built-in  data- types  see Figure 2.3 . Some of these datatypes are primitives—they do   2.4 Schema Deﬁnition—Stage 2  43  not rely on the deﬁnition of other datatypes. Other datatypes are derived datatypes—datatypes that are derived from primitive datatypes or from other existing derived datatypes.  User-deﬁned datatypes User-deﬁned datatypes allow schema designers to  create  custom  datatypes.  User-deﬁned  datatypes  are  always  derived datatypes. They are derived either from built-in datatypes or from other user-deﬁned datatypes. There are three methods for deriving a datatype from another datatype: restriction, list, and union.

Primitive datatypes are presented in reverse style. Derivation by list  extension  is indicated with a dotted line; derivation by restriction, with a solid line.   44  Chapter 2 Groundwork  Restriction  is  done  by  adding  more  constraining  facets.  Here  is  an example  for  constraining  the  value  space  of  base  type  string by enumeration:                   Any datatype can be extended to a list of this datatype. The following example shows the deﬁnition of a list of integer values between 0 and 255 of length 3. As we can see, it is possible to use the facet length to con- strain the size of a list.  With the union operation, it is possible to combine disparate datatypes into a single datatype. In the following example we combine the rgbColor datatype deﬁnition from above with a text-oriented color datatype. This allows us to specify a color either by a triple of integers or by a keyword.                                                          2.4 Schema Deﬁnition—Stage 2  45  This example also shows that an operator such as union may refer to an existing datatype or may deﬁne member datatypes implicitly.  Complex Datatypes It would seem that where there is a simpleType dec- laration, there must also be a complexType declaration. And, in fact, there is.  Complex  types  are  used  to  combine  several  XML  elements  and attributes into one datatype, so they are a central element in schema def- inition  Thompson et al. 2001 .  Here is an example:  Simple content                 This deﬁnition uses a simple content model  i.e., only character data, no child elements  of type decimal and extends it with an attribute of type string and with the name currency.  As we can see, complex types can constrain the content of an element to a certain model. In particular, complex datatypes can construct aggre- gations of child elements, as is possible with model groups in a DTD.  The content model can be deﬁned as    empty. The element must not have content but may have attributes.    sequence. An  ordered  sequence  of  child  elements  or  other  model  groups.    choice. Alternative child elements or other model groups.   all. An unordered sequence of simple or complex child elements  all  groups cannot contain other model groups .    group. This connector allows naming a model group or referring to a  named model group. So model group deﬁnitions may be reused.  A particle consists of an element, a wildcard, or another model group with optional minOccurs and maxOccurs properties that control the num- ber of occurrences of the particle. These replace the “?”, “*”, “+” modi- ﬁers  known  from  DTDs  but  allow  a  ﬁner  control  over  the  number  of occurrences.  Or it can be deﬁned as a model group. Model groups consist of a list of particles combined using connectors:  Complex content   46  Chapter 2 Groundwork  Wildcards  Mixed content  Wildcards are declared with the schema elements   and <xsd: anyAttribute> and  allow  for  the  inclusion  of  elements  and  attributes from  foreign  namespaces  in  the  schema.  For  example,  sections  of XHTML, SVG, RDF, and other content can be included in a document.  By default, a complex type must only contain element data; that is, text cannot be interspersed with elements. To allow for mixed content  i.e.,  interspersed  text  between  child  elements ,  the  attribute  mixed= ”true” must be declared in the deﬁnition of the complex type. Unlike DTDs, XML Schema allows control over the number and order of child el- ements within the mixed content.  Document Structure To  deﬁne  an  XML  schema  we  need  only  four  basic  elements.  The   element contains the whole schema deﬁnition and deﬁnes the  XML  Schema  namespace.  As  children  of  the    element  we have the following:      deﬁnes  elements.  The  ﬁrst  deﬁnition  within    deﬁnes the root element of a document. These elements have either a simple or a complex type.      deﬁnes the substructure of elements of that type, that is, which attributes these elements have and which child elements they contain.      deﬁnes the type of a leaf element or of an attribute.  We demonstrate this in an example:     <bookOrder orderDate=”2001-01-27”  xmlns:xsi=”http:  www.w3.org 1999 XMLSchema-instance” xsi:schemaLocation=”http:  www.bookdomain.com bookorder  http:  www.bookdomain.com bookorder.xsd”  >      Venus Reader   585 Chapel Street   Papermoon   CA   97989       2.4 Schema Deﬁnition—Stage 2  47      Rick Reader   18 Marine Parade   Albany   WA   9832       Special Valentine’s wrapping!          The mint lawn   1   19.95   On stock           In the root element of this document we declared the namespace for XML Schema instances and the location of the schema deﬁnition. The location declaration consists of a pair of values deﬁning the namespace http:  www.bookdomain.com bookorder and the schema location http:   www.bookdomain.com bookorder.xsd. The namespace identiﬁes the schema deﬁnition by its target namespace deﬁnition, while the schema location gives a hint to the processor about where to ﬁnd the schema ﬁle.  The schema deﬁnition could look like this:  <xsd:schema  xmlns:xsd=”http:  www.w3.org 2000 08 XMLSchema” targetNamespace=”http:  www.bookdomain.com bookorder”>  Schema location  Target namespace                        48  Chapter 2 Groundwork                                         M  A       E  T  <xsd:element name=”item” minOccurs=”1”   maxOccurs=”unbounded”>  Y  F L                                    <xsd:attribute name=”currency”  type=”xsd:string” >                   Team-Fly®   2.4 Schema Deﬁnition—Stage 2  49                                Here  we  see  that  most  elements  are  deﬁned  locally  within  the complexType declaration.  Only  the  root  element    and  the   element are declared globally on the schema level, the   ele- ment for the reason that it is used in various places. Also interesting is the pattern deﬁnition for the ISBN datatype.  Namespaces XML Schema provides full support for namespaces. Not only element and attribute names can be associated with a target namespace but also type names. The schema can enforce the speciﬁcation of namespaces for ele- ments  and  attributes  individually  or  for  all  elements  and  attributes deﬁned in the schema. It is good practice to enforce namespace qualiﬁca- tion for elements but not for attributes.  Multinamespace documents are supported, too. Document instances can use elements and attributes from multiple namespaces deﬁned in the corresponding  schemata.  Schema  deﬁnitions  may  refer  to  types  from other namespaces by importing external schemata. Finally, the wildcards any and anyAttribute allow the inclusion of content from foreign name- spaces.  Nil Values, Uniqueness, and Keys DTDs  support  only  the  concept  of  optional  elements.  An  element  is either present or absent.  XML Schema also allows the expression of the absence of a value in another  manner  by  introducing  the  concept  of  “nillable”  elements. Within  a  schema  an  element  can  be  deﬁned  as nillable.  In  the  docu- ment instance a nillable element can—via the attribute xsi:nil—indicate that  its  content  is  indeed  nil.  An  element  with  the  attribute xsi:nil= ”true” may not contain content, but it can have other attributes.  Multiple namespaces   50  Chapter 2 Groundwork  Cross- references  Of course, this concept was not introduced to split hairs about noth- ingness but to support the exchange of data with relational databases. In SQL  databases,  ﬁeld  contents  can  have  the  value  null,  so  supporting  a similar concept in XML makes it easier to convert XML to SQL and vice versa  for example, to export import without a schema deﬁnition .  XML Schema provides the built-in datatypes ID and IDREF for model- ing relations between document elements. However, the main purpose of these datatypes is to provide backwards compatibility with existing XML documents:    Because  ID  and  IDREF  are  attribute  datatypes,  it  is  not  possible  to declare another datatype for a key. For example, is it not possible to de- clare a primary key of type date. It is also not possible to use an ele- ment as a key.    ID  and  IDREF  cannot  handle  composite  keys.  This  is  required  if  we  want to be compatible with relational databases.    ID  and  IDREF  cannot  be  scoped;  that  is,  they  always  apply  to  the  whole document.  XML Schema therefore introduces several new constructs. The unique clause deﬁnes elements, attributes, or combinations thereof that need to be unique within a deﬁned context:              We assume that we have placed the deﬁnition of this unique clause into the deﬁnition of element bookOrder orderlist. We declare the attribute ISBN   indicated  by  “@”   as  unique  within  the  context  of  bookOrder  orderlist because we do not want more than one item within element orderlist with the same ISBN. The xpath speciﬁcation in the ﬁeld element locates the attribute relative to the context speciﬁed in the selector ele- ment.  XPath is described in Section 2.5.1.  The   clause could contain several   clauses to specify ﬁeld combinations as unique.  The key clause looks similar. It allows the deﬁnition of tuples of ele- ments and attributes as primary keys. These tuples must be unique, and they must exist within the deﬁned context.              2.4 Schema Deﬁnition—Stage 2  51  Assuming that we have placed the deﬁnition of this key clause into the deﬁnition of the root element bookOrder, it allows us to access the items in orderlist directly via a key.  Similarly there is a keyref clause to deﬁne foreign keys:              Assuming that we have placed the deﬁnition of this keyref clause into the deﬁnition of the root element bookOrder and that bookOrder contains another  element  undeliverableItems that  lists  undeliverable  items,  we have established here a cross-reference between undeliverableItems and orderlist. To this purpose the keyref clause refers to the previously de- ﬁned key primaryKeyISBN via the refer attribute.  With the support for null values, full support for uniqueness, primary and foreign keys, and the support for classical datatypes, XML Schema improves the compatibility of XML with relational technology.  It is now easier to convert XML schemata into SQL schemata and vice versa,  and  to  import  XML  into  relational  databases  or  to  export  XML from relational databases. However, whether this always makes sense re- mains  questionable.  Relational  databases  require  data  structures  to  be normalized,  but  XML  documents  are  usually  not.  On  the  other  hand, normalized relational data structures do not contain all structural infor- mation because some of this information is lost during the normalization process—information that has to be added by the applications that pro- cess this data. Exporting relational databases into XML results therefore in a poor data model, losing some of the expressive power of XML. We will discuss these modeling aspects in the next chapter.  Reuse Mechanisms XML Schema provides a rich set of mechanisms that allow the reuse of schema deﬁnitions or parts thereof:   Attribute groups. Attribute groups can combine several attribute deﬁni- tions into a single named group. The whole group can then be refer- enced by specifying the group name.    Substitution groups. These work as a kind of alias mechanism for ele- ments, allowing the substitution for occurrences of the so-called head element of a substitution group with type-compatible members of the same substitution group.  XML and SQL   52  Chapter 2 Groundwork  Advantages  Restrictions  There are, however, a few restrictions:    Abstract type deﬁnitions. Type deﬁnitions can be classiﬁed as abstract. These types can be used only to derive other types and not for element or attribute deﬁnition.    Inclusion and import. External schemata and types can be included or imported  into  a  schema  deﬁnition.  While  inclusion  works  within  a single namespace, import can compose schemata across several name- spaces. This allows the establishment of type libraries, for example, for companywide datatypes.    Redeﬁnition. Redeﬁnition  works  similarly  to  inclusion  but  allows  the  modiﬁcation of the included types.    Instance subtyping. XML Schema is ﬂexible enough to allow instance el- ements to be subtyped; that is, the original type is replaced with a de- rived type  either a restricted or an extended type . This is achieved via the xsi:type attribute.  Final Remarks about XML Schema XML Schema marks a major step forward in schema deﬁnition for XML. With its rich hierarchy of datatypes, support for user-deﬁned datatypes, support  for  namespaces,  improved  compatibility  with  relational  data- bases, and support for schema modularization and reuse, XML Schema elevates XML from a mere document description language to a general data description language.    XML Schema does not support XML entities, which can require the use of both DTDs and XML Schema for document type deﬁnition. The or- der of processing is such that ﬁrst the entities deﬁned in the DTD are resolved  default values for attributes are also inserted into the docu- ment  before the document is validated against the XSD schema.    Modeling constraints are limited under XML Schema. Single-ﬁeld con- straints can be modeled via user-deﬁned datatype deﬁnitions and the unique construct. Cross-ﬁeld constraints, however, such as referential integrity constraints, are limited to the key keyref construct. We will discuss advanced schema validation techniques in Section 2.9.    The deﬁnition of context-sensitive elements is possible via local ele- ment  deﬁnitions  but  not  for  recursive  elements.  Recursive  elements must be deﬁned on the document level.    XSD schemata can be quite long. In many cases, this will exclude XML Schema  from  client-side  validation  because  transmission  takes  too long.   2.5 Access and Composition  53  Tree structure  2.5 ACCESS AND COMPOSITION  While XML and XML Schema can be regarded as the core standards for XML, there are several other W3C speciﬁcations such as XPath, XPointer, XInclude,  XQuery,  XSL,  and  DOM  that  regulate  access  to  XML  docu- ments and their composition and transformation.  2.5.1 XPath The XPath recommendation  Clark and DeRose 1999  deﬁnes how nodes within XML documents can be accessed. XPath expressions are used in many other standards. We have already seen XPath utilized in the unique, key, and keyref constructs in XML Schema. XPath plays a crucial role in standards such as XSLT  Chapter 9  and XQuery  Section 2.6 .  Because the XML information set has a tree structure it should be easy to  pinpoint  an  element  or  an  attribute  by  specifying  all  parent  nodes, because this is done with path expressions that specify a ﬁle within a ﬁle directory. Therefore, for our   example, the expression   book @ISBN  identiﬁes the ISBN attribute of the   element. In XPath’s abbreviated syntax, attribute names are always preﬁxed with “@”  in the full syntax the preﬁx is attribute:: .  That was easy. Things get a little bit more complicated when we have  Node sets  to deal with recurring elements. What does, for example,   book authors author lastName  mean? Because the author element is recurring, the expression does not unambiguously identify a single node. Instead it resolves to a node set. The  expression  identiﬁes  the    elements  in  all    ele- ments. In our example this would resolve to Goldfarb and Prescod. When we discuss the features of XPath, it is important to remember that XPath is operating with node sets and not only with single nodes.  To restrict node sets, XPath allows the speciﬁcation of ﬁlters within a path expression. Here is a very simple ﬁlter that helps us select a speciﬁc author:  Filters   book authors author[1] lastName  Filters are always speciﬁed in brackets. The ﬁlter here selects the ﬁrst ele- ment within the node set obtained by   book authors author   54  Chapter 2 Groundwork  Axis speciﬁers  Upper and lower case  Functions  Using  ﬁlters  we  can  thus  pinpoint  a  single  element  within  an  XML document.  In the previous examples we have used only the parent-child relation to specify a node set. In addition, XPath allows the speciﬁcation of node sets  by  exploiting  other  relations  such  as  the  ancestor-descendant  re- lation, the positional order relation, or the relation between namespace and  nodes.  For  this  purpose,  XPath  provides  axis  speciﬁers such  as parent::, ancestor::, child::, descendant::, following::, namespace::, and so on. However, what is mostly used is the abbreviated syntax, which we use in Table 2.2.  Like everything else in XML, string comparisons are also case sensitive. If  we  want  to  make  case-insensitive  comparisons,  we  have  to  translate both operands of the comparison into upper case. This can be done with the translate function:  translate “Goldfarb”,”abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz”,”ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO PQRSTUVWXYZ”   However, this function, despite the rather extensive notation, does not work well for uppercase-lowercase translations in all languages. XPath 2.0 will address this issue.  In addition to the translate function, XPath supports other functions  to test conditions or to compare contents  see Table 2.3 .  2.5.2 XPointer  XPointer  DeRose, Maler, and Daniel 2001  is built on XPath. Its purpose is  to  augment  URI  addressing,  so  that  it  becomes  possible  to  address fragments of an XML ﬁle. A similar feature is known in HTML: a speciﬁc anchor within an HTML page can be addressed by complementing a URI with the anchor name, for example,  http:  www.bookshop.com book the_comic_book.htmlreviews.  However, HTML requires the deﬁnition of an anchor element within the target document. XPointer, in contrast, allows access to document ele- ments that are not speciﬁcally marked. It does so by exploiting the ability of XPath to pinpoint single elements within an XML document.

If we had  omitted  the  [1],  we  would  have  addressed  all    elements: pointers can point to multiple targets.  XPointer introduces some extensions of its own:  xpointer string-range path,substring     2.5 Access and Composition  57  addresses  all  strings  matching  ‘substring’ within  the  element  that  is speciﬁed by path. For example,  http:  www.bookdomain.com books the_xml_handbook.xml xpointer string-range   title,’XML’    addresses all ‘XML’ substrings in the   elements of our example.  Another  feature  of  XPointer  is  the  ability  to  address  ranges within  a  Ranges  document:  xpointer startpoint range-to endpoint    For example, the expression  xpointer   author[1] ﬁrstName range-to lastName    addresses the range from the   element to the   ele- ment of the ﬁrst   element in our book example.  We ﬁnish our short discussion of XPointer with two forms of abbrevi-  ated syntax that XPointer entertains:  identiﬁer  is equivalent to  xpointer id “identiﬁer”    meaning that it points to the element with the ID “identiﬁer”. Although this notation is similar to a fragment pointer in HTML, there is a differ- ence: in HTML the fragment is identiﬁed by an   element with a spe- ciﬁc name attribute. XPointer, in contrast, can use this syntax to point to any element that has an attribute of type ID.   1 3 2 1 2  addresses elements by counting, starting at the root element. When an element is found, the process continues with the next number, counting the  child  elements  of  that  element,  and  so  on.  In  the  context  of  our example the above speciﬁcation would be equivalent to  xpointer  book authors author[2] name lastName   2.5.3 XInclude  XInclude   currently  a  working  draft   speciﬁes  how  to  include  external XML documents  or, by using the XPointer notation, parts thereof  in a   58  Chapter 2 Groundwork  target XML document  Marsh and Orchard 2001 . As such it is designed to eventually replace external entities.  For example:      ...     with legal.xml deﬁned as        opinion    Y  F L  M  A  This would result in the following document:      ...  E  The publishers’ view may differ from the authors’ expressed  The publishers’ view may differ from the authors’ expressed  T     opinion        Namespace support  XInclude  can  compose  documents  from  different  namespaces.  The attribute parse=”text” allows the inclusion of unparsed text. Otherwise, the default value of parse=”xml” forces the processor to parse the included text and reject non–well-formed XML. If the parsed text contains nested inclusions, these are resolved as well.  2.5.4 XML Base XML Base is probably the shortest standard the W3C has ever published. It speciﬁes just a single attribute: xml:base  Marsh 2001 . We will keep this section similarly short. Basically, xml:base speciﬁes a base URI as the basis  for  all  relative  URIs  that  appear  in  the  element  where  xml:base is speciﬁed. Typical applications are XLink and XInclude.  Team-Fly®   2.6 Querying XML  59  2.6 QUERYING XML  XQuery currently has the status of a working draft  Chamberlin, Clark, et al.  2001 :  “It  is  inappropriate  to  use  W3C  Working  Drafts  as  reference material or to cite them as other than work in progress.” Given that, here we will take only a short browse through the major concepts of XQuery. An extensive base of use cases, queries, and expected results is contained in Chamberlin, Fankhauser, et al.  2001 .  XQuery is derived from Jonathan Robie’s Quilt, which in turn utilizes concepts from other query language proposals. There had been quite a few: the deﬁnition of a standard query language for XML has a history. Many of the results obtained by this work found their way into the deﬁ- nition of XPath  see Section 2.5.1 . XQuery, therefore, addresses topics that are not covered by XPath. XQuery expressions look a bit similar to SQL  expressions,  and  indeed  XQuery  borrows  concepts  from  SQL  and OQL. Figure 2.4 shows XQuery in action.  Origins  Figure 2.4 XQuery in action: QuiP, an early implementation of XQuery, doing a join over a document base of books.   60  Chapter 2 Groundwork  2.6.1 Expression Types  An XQuery expression can consist of a number of expression types.  Path Expressions Path expressions are formulated using XPath  see Section 2.5.1 , which is currently  also  under  revision   XPath  2.0 .  XQuery  is  expected  to  be  a superset of XPath 2.0.  In XQuery, only the abbreviated XPath syntax is used. The result of a path expression is a list of nodes. For XQuery two operators were added: the dereference operator and the range operator.    The range operator RANGE x TO y speciﬁes a range of nodes.  For example:   book authors author [RANGE 1 TO 2] name results in  a list of name elements for two authors.    The dereference operator => can follow an IDREF-type attribute. It re- turns the element s  that are referenced by the attribute. This operator has a similar function as the id   function in XPath.  For example:   PurchaseOrder Orderline @pid=>Description would extract the product id from a purchase order document, look up the product element identiﬁed by this product id, and return the descrip- tion of the product.  The XQuery Draft currently speciﬁes the dereference operator only for IDREF-type attributes, not for the more general keyref construct of XML Schema.  Variables XQuery supports the use of variables. Variable names are preﬁxed with “$”. It is possible to assign a value to a variable  see below  and to reuse that value in a later part of the same query. This is an important feature for performing complex joins.  Element Constructors Element constructors are, as the name says, used to construct new ele- ments.  These  can  constitute  the  result  of  the  query,  or  they  can  be assigned to a variable for later usage. Element constructors allow the out- put of a query to be freely structured. For example:       $t     $a        2.6 Querying XML  61  Using variables in place of tag names is also allowed:     FLWR Expressions “Flower” expressions are constituted from the keywords FOR, LET, WHERE, and RETURN, which are used in this sequence. These keywords make an XQuery expression look almost like an SQL expression.  The ﬁrst part of a query consists of a FOR or LET clause or a combina-  tion. FOR is used where iterations are needed. For example:  FOR $a IN   book authors  This iterates over all elements in authors, assigning with each iteration a new author element to $a.  LET assigns the result of an expression to a variable. For example:  LET $v :=   book authors  This assigns the whole authors element to $v.  The second part is optional and consists of a WHERE clause. WHERE acts as a ﬁlter. Only when the WHERE clause is true is the RETURN clause invoked. The  condition  in  the  WHERE clause  may  be  a  Boolean  expression  con- nected by AND, OR, or NOT. For example:  WHERE $a Name LastName = “Goldfarb”  AND $a Name FirstName = “Charles”  The last part of the expression consists of a RETURN clause. RETURN re- turns the results of the FLWR expression. Its operand is usually a refer- ence to a variable or an element constructor. For example:  RETURN $a @aid  This would return the @aid attribute of the author element that was pre- viously assigned to $a.  Expressions Involving Operators and Functions Expressions can be constructed in XQuery using inﬁx and preﬁx opera- tors.  Parentheses  are  used  for  nested  expressions.  XQuery  supports  the usual set of arithmetic and logical operators. In addition it supports the collection operators UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT. The operators BEFORE and AFTER can be used to select nodes by relative position.   62  Chapter 2 Groundwork  Conditional Expressions Conditional expressions are constructed in the usual way with the key- words IF, THEN, ELSE. For example:  IF name $e  = “Service”  THEN $e Duration ELSE    Quantiﬁed Expressions The keywords SOME and EVERY, in combination with SATISFIES, allow us to test if some or all elements in a collection meet a speciﬁc condition. For example:  FOR $b IN   book WHERE SOME $p IN $b authors SATISFIES  $p Name LastName = “Goldfarb”  RETURN $b Title  List Constructors Lists can be constructed with brackets; the list elements are separated by commas. The empty list is represented by [ ]. The function distinct   can be used to remove duplicates from a list. The operator SORTBY can be used to sort a list.  Expressions That Test or Modify Datatypes XQuery uses the type system deﬁned in XML Schema  see Section 2.4.2 . The keyword ELEMENT is used for element types deﬁned with  . LIST x  is used for lists containing elements of type x.  It is possible to test the type of a node  INSTANCEOF  or to modify the type  of  a  node   CAST .  The  keyword  TREAT allows  us  to  narrow  down  a type. For example:  IF $a INSTANCEOF postalAddress THEN computePostage TREAT AS postalAddress $a    Functions XQuery deﬁnes a set of built-in functions. We have already used the func- tion name  ,  which  returns  the  tag  name  of  an  element.  Contained  in XQuery are the functions known from XPath, all the aggregation func- tions of SQL  such as avg  , sum  , count  , max  , and min   , and some other useful functions such as distinct   or empty  .   2.6 Querying XML  63  In  addition,  XQuery  allows  the  deﬁnition  of  user-deﬁned  functions.  User-deﬁned functions  Functions can be deﬁned recursively. The following function lists all  For example:  FUNCTION grandchildren ELEMENT $e   RETURNS LIST ELEMENT   { $e * * }  part and subpart IDs for a product:  FUNCTION subpartIDs ELEMENT $e    RETURNS LIST ELEMENT   $e @pid UNION subpartIDs $e parts @pid=>*   {  }  Joins Using this functionality, it is possible to construct powerful queries. The use of variables allows the construction of any type of joins  there is no special join operator in XQuery .  For example:    {  FOR $s IN document “book.xml”   RETURN     {  }  $s title, $s authors FOR $r IN document “reviews.xml”    [title = $s title],  RETURN $r review, $r reviewer      SORTBY authors author[1] name lastName   }    This  is  a  left  outer  join,  listing  all  books.  If  reviews  exist  for  a  speciﬁc book,  the  reviews  are  merged  into  the  result;  if  not,  the  book  is  listed without reviews. The results are sorted according to the last name of the ﬁrst author.   64  Chapter 2 Groundwork  Here is another example:    {  FOR $s IN document “book.xml” ,  $r IN document “reviews.xml” [title = $s title]  RETURN     {  }     $s title, $s authors, $r review, $r reviewer   SORTBY authors author[1] name lastName   }    This is the classic inner join, listing only the books having reviews. Note that  the  join  is  accomplished  with  a  ﬁlter  expression   [title  = $s title] . This construct allows for a very wide range of joins indeed; the equality join is only a special case.  2.6.2 Discussion  XML is an integrative data format. A large amount of information on the Web is in XML format, relational databases provide XML interfaces, and knowledge bases using RDF  see Section 3.3  or topic maps  Section 7.2  have  an  XML  serialization  format.  With  a  language  such  as  XQuery  it becomes possible to query and combine all these sources of wisdom.  While the proposed syntax is well suited for user interfaces and builds on the knowledge of SQL-educated users, an alternate XML-ish syntax is needed as well, to allow the programmatic generation of queries through a DOM API or with the help of an XSLT style sheet. The W3C has pub- lished a working draft for such a syntax  Malhotra, Robie, and Rys 2001 .  2.7 XSL  EXTENSIBLE STYLESHEET LANGUAGE   The XSL speciﬁcations deﬁne how XML documents can be transformed into another format, especially into a presentation format. The speciﬁca- tions come in three parts: XPath, XSLT, and XSLFO.  XPath  see Section 2.5.1  was originally designed in the context of XSL. Now it has become a separate recommendation that plays an important  Syntax  XPath   2.8 XML APIs  65  role both within XSL and within XQuery. Many other speciﬁcations, such as XML Schema and XPointer, rely on XPath.  XSLT   XSL  Transformations   speciﬁes—as  the  name  says—how  XML documents can be transformed into another XML  or non-XML  format. XSLT has both declarative and procedural elements to specify transfor- mations  and  relies  heavily  on  XPath.  Because  of  its  importance  as  a multipurpose tool for processing XML documents, we discuss XSLT ex- tensively in Chapter 9.  One possible outcome of such transformations is formatting objects  XSLFO . Formatting objects  see Section 8.2.4  conclude the XSL trilogy. XSLFO can be compared to CSS in the HTML domain. It must be said that the transformation into HTML + CSS is currently a more realistic ap- proach  for  displaying  XML  documents  than  the  transformation  into formatting  objects  because  few  Web  browsers  support  formatting  ob- jects. However, formatting objects can be used as an intermediate format when converting an XML document into a PDF document  see also Sec- tion 8.6 .  XSLT  XSLFO  2.8 XML APIs  Application  program  interfaces  for  XML  deﬁne  how  applications  can make use of existing parsers and other XML tools. Although applications are free to treat an XML document as a plain character string and do the parsing with custom logic, it is better if they avoid this and use a standard parser such as SAX or DOM.  2.8.1 SAX  SAX  Simple API for XML  is not a W3C standard but a joint development of  the  members  of  the  XML-DEV  mailing  list.  Various  SAX  parsers  for different programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, Perl, or Del- phi,  are  publicly  available.  The  SAX  speciﬁcations  are  published  at www.megginson.com.  SAX is an event-based parser—the parser reads an XML input stream. In the case of events  such as startDocument, endDocument, startElement, endElement, characters, ignorableWhitespace,  and  processingInstruc- tion , the parser calls back similarly named methods or routines of the host program, which can then take appropriate action. Because XML doc- uments have a tree structure, the host program can analyze a document with  relative  ease.  Encountering  a  startElement event,  the  program  Event based   66  Chapter 2 Groundwork  pushes the node onto a stack, while an endElement event removes the top element from the stack. Using such a technique, the host program is al- ways aware of the current context of an element.  SAX is relatively easy on resources. It does not require much memory because it is not necessary to store the whole XML document in memory. Because of its simplicity, SAX is easy to learn, too. On the other hand, SAX is a read-only API: it is not possible to modify an existing XML doc- ument via SAX.  The new SAX2 API additionally incorporates support for XML name-  spaces, ﬁlter chains, and querying.  SAX parsers are also called push-parsers because the parser pushes rec- ognized  tokens  toward  the  client.  Recently,  so-called  pull-parsers  have appeared, parsers where the client controls the parsing process. This pro- vides increased ﬂexibility to the client, and consequently newer DOM im- plementations  see next section  use pull-parsing techniques.  2.8.2 DOM The Document Object Model  DOM  is a full application programming interface  for  XML  documents.  It  allows  clients  not  only  to  navigate within XML documents but also to retrieve, add, modify, or delete ele- ments and content. To provide a language-independent API description, the DOM speciﬁcation makes use of the OMG IDL  Object Management Group  Interface  Description  Language   as  deﬁned  in  the  CORBA  2.2 speciﬁcation.  In contrast to SAX, DOM stores the complete document structure in memory.  The  document  is  ﬁrst  read  in  and  parsed,  and  then  a  tree  of node objects is built in memory. Because at least one object is needed for each document node, DOM is relatively heavy on resources. More recent DOM implementations, however, such as Enhydra DOM  Java  and pull- dom,  contained  in  pyXML   Python ,  use  lazy  instantiation  to  save  re- sources. This technique requires slightly more overhead if you access an element at the very end of a document, but should provide a SAX-like re- source utilization when you access an element at the very beginning of a document.  After the complete document has been parsed, control is passed back to the host program. This program can then use the methods of the DOM API to navigate the document tree and to retrieve content, modify nodes, delete nodes, or insert new nodes. After processing, the document tree can be written to an output stream.  The advantage of DOM for the programmer is that it is not he or she who has to do the bookkeeping. Context information can be readily ob-  SAX2  Performance issues  Random access   2.8 XML APIs  67  Levels  tained  via  the  DOM  API.  For  programmers,  DOM  is  the  API  of  choice when random access to document content is required.  Because the DOM API is very rich  the Element interface alone has 27 different methods, and DOM knows 17 different interfaces , for program- mers there is some effort involved in mastering DOM programming.  A popular DOM implementation on Windows platforms is Microsoft’s MSXML. Since it has a COM interface, it equips any COM-enabled Win- dows application  including VBScript  with an XML DOM. Another pop- ular DOM implementation is Xerces, from the Apache Software Founda- tion, which exists in a Java and a C++ version. In the Java community JDOM and DOM4J are popular. These APIs have a simpler  albeit non- standard  interface.  There are currently three DOM API levels: DOM Level 1, DOM Level 2, and DOM Level 3  LeHors et al. 2001 . Apart from other improvements, DOM Level 2 adds an event model  McCarron et al. 2001  to the DOM speciﬁcation. DOM Level 3 adds an XML content model, load and save, document validation with DTD or XML Schema, and better namespace handling.  2.8.3 Binding The Java Architecture for XML Binding  JAXB  is a recent  and still ongo- ing  development that can replace SAX- and DOM-based solutions in Java environments  JAXB 2001 . JAXB includes a compiler that maps a DTD or XML Schema to a set of Java classes  a binding schema must manually be created to deﬁne this mapping . Document instances can then be con- verted to Java class instances  objects  and vice versa. Because the JAXB framework  generates  speciﬁc  classes  to  represent  the  document  type, JAXB  can  achieve  a  higher  processing  speed  than  a  SAX  parser   which works in interpretative mode and requires a call-back method invocation with every token processed . After importing a document, the elements and attributes can be accessed and manipulated as ordinary Java objects and ﬁelds, providing a similar if not higher degree of ease of use than DOM, but taking fewer resources. Note, however, that a DTD or schema is required to process XML documents with JAXB.  Similar technology is available with Breeze XML Studio, Software AG’s  Bolero  Daum and Scheller 2000 , Enhydra’s Zeus, and others.  2.8.4 Which API? The  decision  on  which  of  the  three  APIs   SAX,  DOM,  or  JAXB   to  use depends largely on the platform. If you need access via a COM interface   68  Chapter 2 Groundwork  Y  F L  M  A   for example, from VBScript , you have to use MSXML, so you are limited to DOM and SAX2. In a Java environment, however, JAXB probably will be  the  best  choice  once  it  is  released.  Currently,  as  we  stated  earlier, JDOM  and  DOM4J  are  popular  in  the  Java  community,  although  this technology is still in beta status and provides no standard APIs.  The decision between DOM and SAX is not too difﬁcult. If you want not only to read documents but also to update them, use DOM. If your documents contain cross-references  using ID and IDREF attributes , use DOM because you need to go back and forth to evaluate the document. If you  need  random  access  to  document  nodes,  use  DOM.  If  you  don’t know how to implement a stack, use DOM.  Otherwise use SAX. It will happily noodle even mega- and gigabyte-  sized documents.  2.9 SCHEMA DEFINITION—STAGE 3  E  T  Even  before  the  deﬁnition  of  the  W3C’s  XML  Schema  speciﬁcation, schema  deﬁnition  was  the  topic  of  heated  debate,  and  it  still  remains so after the ﬁnal recommendation. The current discussion on “when to use  DTDs  and  when  to  use  XML  Schema”  is  an  indication  that  XML Schema is not the answer to all problems. In particular, XML Schema is considered by many to be too complicated and too heavyweight. But it also misses out on some ﬁner points of schema deﬁnition such as cross- element and cross-attribute checks, for example.  About a month after the release of the ﬁnal XML Schema recommen- dation,  OASIS  published  a  draft  for  “the  next-generation  schema  lan- guage,” called RELAX NG. RELAX NG is based on the earlier RELAX and on James Clark’s TREX. It is lightweight like DTDs but includes support for  namespaces,  for  modularization   including  the  possibility  of  con- structing  unions,  intersections,  and  differences  of  schemata ,  and  for datatypes  incorporating XML Schema datatypes , and it also has some other improvements. Last but not least, a RELAX NG schema is—in con- trast to a DTD—an XML document. Details are given in Clark and Murata  2001  and Daum  2002 .  2.9.1 A Feather Duster for XML Schemata  When we earlier discussed XML Schema, we had already observed that XML  Schema  allows  the  deﬁnition  of  only  the  most  basic  constraints such as datatypes and uniqueness. XML Schema fails when it comes to  Team-Fly®   2.9 Schema Deﬁnition—Stage 3  69  Schematron  Based on XSLT  constraints  that  involve  several  elements  or  attributes.  If  we  want,  for example, to enforce that attribute B must be present whenever attribute A is present, or that attributes A and B are mutually exclusive, we are out of luck. Or, if we want to enforce the presence of element C when attribute A contains an “@” character, we are similarly left on our own.  Rick Jellife’s Schematron  Jellife 2001  is a tool that can do such con- straint validation. Although Schematron is not a schema deﬁnition lan- guage in its own right, it can be used alongside DTDs and XML Schema. The concept of Schematron is as simple as it is ingenious. The tech- nique used is a bit similar to the one used in XML Schema for the deﬁni- tion of unique, key, or keyref constraints  Jellife is a member of the XML Schema working group . Each Schematron script consists of a number of rules. Each rule ﬁrst speciﬁes a context node, via an XPath expression. On the basis of the selected context node, other XPath expressions perform tests. The success or failure of each test is reported. Since XPath is quite powerful, the range of constraints that can be checked is very wide. In particular  it  is  possible  to  check  for  cross-element  and  cross-document constraints.  Technically, Schematron utilizes XSLT to validate an XML document. Using an appropriate XSL style sheet, the document is transformed into a report that gives information about invalid structures within the docu- ment.  However,  this  requires  that  the  XML  document  is  already  well formed; otherwise it would not be possible to process it with XSLT.  Schematron  uses  a  two-phase  concept:  The  ﬁrst  step  is  only  applied once to a particular Schematron script and compiles it—with the help of the  Schematron  processor  style  sheet—into  a  validation  style  sheet.  In the second step this validation style sheet is applied to individual docu- ment instances.  Here  is  an  example  of  a  Schematron  script  that  requires  that  the    of a book author must be speciﬁed whenever a   was speciﬁed.           <assert test = “not ﬁrstName    or  ﬁrstName and lastName ”>  lastName missing in author&apos;s name              70  Chapter 2 Groundwork  Attribute oriented  The context attribute in the   element speciﬁes the context node book authors author name. The   element then tests for the con- straint. If the test fails, the text content of the   element goes into the report.  Similar schema validation is possible with the Schema Adjunct Frame-  work discussed in Section 4.4.2.  2.9.2 Elements Versus Attributes In the XML community  and previously in the SGML community  there is a long and ongoing debate about when to use an element to model an information  or  data  item  and  when  to  use  an  attribute.  At  times  the debate has become almost a religious issue: each party is in the possession of “The Truth”—even if their respective truths are mutually exclusive  for the philosophical and logical background of this phenomenon, see Sec- tion 4.3 .  We are not inclined to take the position of either side but will simply list the pros and cons of each approach. What we will ﬁnd is that with the deﬁnition of XML Schema some of the arguments against elements do not hold any longer. In this respect, XML now differs from SGML.  The  following  is  a  boiled-down  version  of  our   example  from Section 2.2 with the extensive use of attributes. The difference in size is striking, and this is also the main reason why authors use attributes to represent content.                   You can also see that we have cut some corners in order to make it ﬁt. In particular we have kept only a single language for the title. To repre- sent  a  multilingual  title  in  one  attribute   unlike  elements,  you  cannot have several attributes with the same name as children of a single ele- ment , we would be required to invent a rather complex attribute format  similar to CSS-style attribute syntax :  title=”en-us:The XML-Handbook™;de-de:Das XML-Handbuch”  This in turn would require us to implement a custom parser to process this complex attribute; furthermore we must postulate that no title ever   2.9 Schema Deﬁnition—Stage 3  71  contains  a  semicolon.  Standard  processors  such  as  XSLT  would  not  be able to break this attribute string into pieces; it would require the use of custom extension logic. Alternatively, we could create differently named attributes—one for each language.  There  is  no  problem  parsing  the  author’s  name.  This  attribute  type could be declared as NMTOKENS, so a parser would give us a list of tokens consisting of ﬁrst name, middle name, and last name. But beware: noth- ing stops us from specifying a name like this:     Now the parser would return us “Prescod,” as the ﬁrst name and “Paul” as the last name  assuming that we always interpret the last list element as last name . Custom logic would be required to look for a trailing “,” after “Prescod” and swap the tokens accordingly  and remove the comma .  You can clearly see the drawbacks of attributes for representing com-  plex information.  A good compromise therefore might be  <author aid=”a2”         or     However, in the second case we lose some structural information  that a name is comprised of a ﬁrst name and a last name .  Despite the problems in our naive approach to attributes, it is, in fact, possible to represent any information structure using attributes only. This is done in a way similar to relational databases: the data is normalized and ﬁnally represented as an interrelated network of “ﬂat” elements. The relations between the data elements are not represented through the im- plicit hierarchical relations between parent and child elements, but ex- plicitly via ID, IDREF, and IDREFS attributes:  <book titles=”title.1 title.2”  authors=”author.1 author.2” >      The XML-Handbook™       Das XML-Handbuch          Compromise  “Flat” documents   72  Chapter 2 Groundwork  <Name id=”name.1”   ﬁrst=”Charles” middle=”F.” last=”Goldfarb” >    Here the structure of the document is established via matching ID and IDREFS  IDREFS  keys  @titles, @authors, @name . The advantage is that we can use the well-known relational techniques  see Section 3.1  to keep the design of such a document sound. The disadvantage is that the docu- ment is hard to read. Also it is not shorter than the original document— on the contrary, it is longer. Constructing such a document also requires some bookkeeping  to allocate unique keys to elements , and retrieving information from such a document requires much cross-referencing and joining.  Juxtaposed to this design there are also concepts that throw attributes out altogether. This has culminated in the deﬁnition of MinXML  Park 2000 ,  a  minimal  XML  deﬁnition   without  attributes,  entities,  CDATA, mixed  elements,  etc .  The  logic  to  process  such  XML  is  surprisingly simple; a parser can be formulated in 28 JavaScript statements  by Sjoerd Visscher .  Minimal XML   en-us   The XML-Handbook™    de-de   Das XML-Handbuch                      a1      Charles   F.   Goldfarb           a2      Paul    2.9 Schema Deﬁnition—Stage 3  73   Prescod             The truth lies somewhere between these two extremes and largely de- pends on context and personal taste. Is it essential that the documents be as short as possible, or is it important that the processing logic be kept simple? Is the document only to be used by machines, or is it also to be read by humans? Are the documents machine generated or authored by humans, and, if the latter, with which tools?  Here are a few strong reasons to prefer attributes:  Pro attributes  1. Attributes support the construction of relationships with ID IDREF  keys.  2. A DTD can deﬁne default values only for attributes. 3. A DTD allows simple type deﬁnitions  ID, IDREF, NMTOKEN, and so on   for attributes but not for elements.  4. Attributes  of  an  element  form  an  unordered  set.  This  can  some- times  be  handy  when  no  sequence  order  between  information items is required.  5. Attributes are much easier to access in DOM and SAX. 6. When authoring document-centric XML in an appropriate XML ed- itor, it is often more convenient to use attributes—as the name sug- gests—for attributing text. The attributes will not litter the running text, and spell checking is only applied to elements.  However, with the advent of XML Schema, these advantages of attributes vanish, especially items 1–4, because XML Schema allows the deﬁnition of unique keys, default values, types, and unordered sets for elements also.  And here are a few strong reasons to prefer elements:  Pro elements  1. An  element  can  have  multiple  child  elements  of  the  same  kind.  This is not possible with attributes.  2. Elements  can  be  easily  extended  by  adding  child  elements  or  attributes.  3. Attributes of an element always form an unordered set, so it is not  possible to establish a sequence order across attributes.  4. Elements can contain whitespace and delimiters; whitespace han-  dling can be speciﬁed on the element level.  5. Attributes are harder to search for in search engines. 6. Attributes do not support nil values.   74  Chapter 2 Groundwork  Rules of thumb  Origins  7. When editing data-centric XML in an XML editor, storing content in  attributes  makes  the  editing  process  more  difﬁcult.  Extra  key- strokes are often required to view the attributes.  So, with XML Schema the scale tips toward the use of elements. But we wouldn’t discard attributes completely. There are two rules of thumb on when to use what.  First, some authors recommend using elements to represent the enti- ties of an entity relationship model  see Section 3.2  and using attributes to  represent  the  properties  of  these  entities.  But  what  about  complex properties? A name, for example, is clearly a property of an entity  such as a customer  but has a complex structure  ﬁrst name, middle name, last name . So, we are not too sure about that case.  Second, use attributes to describe metadata  such as language identi- ﬁer, element author, element version, element ID, etc.  and use elements to model content. This is more or less how we have used attributes and elements in the past. However, what is content and what is metadata can depend  on  the  context.  A  good  deﬁnition  to  distinguish  content  from metadata is from Elliot Kimber:  One way to distinguish metadata from content is to ask the question “if I removed this data, would my understanding of or ability to comprehend the content change?” If the answer is no, it’s metadata, if the answer is yes, it’s content  or annotation, which is the third fundamental class of information .  2.9.3 XML Design Patterns  A good exercise when designing an XML Schema is to look at existing schemata. Maybe we can utilize an existing schema and extend it a bit to ﬁt our own requirements. If this is not possible, it may still be possible to pick up a few design elements  i.e., design patterns  and utilize them for our own purposes.  Design patterns were introduced as a formal method into design by the architect Christopher Alexander  who had a background in mathematics as well . Alexander published on urban planning and building architec- ture in the late 1970s. In the late 1980s design patterns were picked up by software architects and found their culmination in the work of the “gang of four,” Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides  Gamma et al. 1995 . Since then patterns have become popular in soft- ware design.  Design patterns describe the relationship between a problem, the con- text of the problem, and the solution to the problem. They describe this relationship in such a generic way that it becomes possible to transfer the   2.9 Schema Deﬁnition—Stage 3  75  way of solving the problem into a different context. Design patterns are not  invented:  they  are  discovered  when  similar  solutions  are  found  to solve similar problems in various contexts.  Now that XML has been around for a few years, design patterns are be- ginning to emerge to solve problems with the design of XML documents. These patterns can be fairly generic or can be more speciﬁc, for example, to solve design problems in the area of electronic business. We therefore ﬁnd various design patterns connected with the various electronic busi- ness platforms such as RosettaNet, BizTalk, or ebXML. These patterns are published either on supporting Web sites in the form of guidelines, or as reusable patterns stored in business community repositories.  A  Web  site  dedicated  to  generic  design  patterns  for  XML  is  www. xmlpatterns.com. At the time of writing, this Web site contained 28 pat- terns:  Catch-All  Element,  Choice  Reducing  Container,  Collection  Ele- ment, Common Attributes, Consistent Element Set, Container Element, Content Type Label, Declare Before First Use, Domain Element, Envelope, Extensible Content Model, Flyweight, Generic Element, Head-Body, Mar- ketplace,  Metadata  First,  Metadata  in  Separate  Document,  Multi  Root Document  Types,  Multiple  Document  Types,  Optional  Container  Ele- ment,  Parallel  Design,  Referenced  Note,  Reuse  Document  Types,  Role Attribute,  Separate  Metadata  and  Data,  Short  Understandable  Names, Universal Root, Use XML.  Here is an example for the Extensible Content Model pattern. The pat- tern addresses the problem that at the time of designing a schema the de- signer may not be able to predict all the possible use cases for the schema and therefore wants to allow document authors to customize the schema on the instance level.  The  solution  is  that  the  schema  designer  adds  an  extension  mecha- nism to the schema deﬁnition. Since we already have discussed such a mechanism  instance subtyping  for XML Schema  see Section 2.4.2 , we present here only a solution for DTDs. This solution is based on parame- ter entities  see Section 2.3.2 , which the document author can overwrite on the instance level.  Let’s discuss this for the example of our book DTD. The book element currently has only the child elements title and authors. If we want to al- low document authors to add additional elements, we can do this in the following way:        ...  Web site  Extending DTDs   76  Chapter 2 Groundwork  We have deﬁned an empty parameter entity details and have appended it to the deﬁnition of element book.  The  document  author  can  override  the  deﬁnition  of  parameter  en- tity details in  the  internal  DTD  subset  and  can  then  add  additional deﬁnitions:  DOCTYPE book SYSTEM “http:  www.book.org book” [        ]>  Given this deﬁnition the document body must then contain a Price ele- ment after the authors element.  2.9.4 Architectural Forms  Architectural forms were ﬁrst formally deﬁned in SGML in 1997 as part of the SGML Extended Facilities in ISO IEC 10744:1997, Annex A.3, Archi- tectural  Form  Deﬁnition  Requirements   Kimber  1998 .  It  did  not  take long  to  adapt  this  technology  to  XML;  a  ﬁrst  SAX  parser  enabled  for architectural forms appeared with the XAF package from David Meggin- son  1998 . A recent development is APEX, an XSLT style sheet that pro- vides  the  same  functionality  as  XAF.  APEX  is  published  as  part  of  the National  Institute  for  Standards  and  Technology   NIST   XSL  Toolbox  ats.nist.gov xsltoolbox   , written by Josh Lubell.  Now, what are architectural forms? Architectural forms  AF  could be roughly compared to a combination of interface and adaptor in object- oriented programming. Concrete XML document types can relate to one or  multiple  base  architectures  which  are  document  types,  too .  An  AF- aware parser can then validate whether document instances satisfy the speciﬁed architectural forms. Elements that do not conform with a speci- ﬁed base architecture can be suppressed so that it is possible to generate different views from a single document.  This technique allows the deﬁnition of speciﬁc document schemata that implement given corporate standards. Rather than deﬁning a single huge and unwieldy XML schema containing every possible element used within  a  corporation,  the  corporate  standards  are  incorporated  into several rather small base architectures. The document schemata created by different work groups can relate to these base architectures, and doc- ument  instances  created  according  to  these  schemata  can  be  checked against  these  base  architectures.  Different  vocabularies  used  in  the  Base architectures   2.9 Schema Deﬁnition—Stage 3  77  base architectures are not a problem because AF allows the renaming of elements.  To use architectural forms with a document, at least one base architec- ture must be speciﬁed in a document in the form of an XML processing instruction:  Using AF     The pseudo-attribute name speciﬁes the name of the base architecture. The pseudo-attribute auto controls automatic association  see below . A docu- ment may specify several base architectures simply by adding more pro- cessing instructions.  We can then use the name of a base architecture within an element deﬁnition  to  map  the  element  of  a  document  instance  to  an  ele- ment within the base architecture  or several base architectures . In the following example we use three base architectures. One     con- trols the layout of the   element; the other two    and <Per- sonId>   control  the  layout  of    elements.  We  have  emphasized these base architectures. We see also how the elements  , <ﬁrst- Name>,  ,  and    are  mapped  to   ,  ,  , and  .              The XML-Handbook™       Das XML-Handbuch              Charles   F.   Goldfarb       ...         78  Chapter 2 Groundwork  The three base architectures may look like these:        product-name                  ﬁrst   middle   last   Y  F L       Default mapping  M  A  E  T  As we have already mentioned, it is possible to use a default mapping of target document names to base architecture names. To enable this fea- ture,  the  auto pseudo-attribute  of  the  processing  instruction  is  set  to auto=”ArcAuto”. The element within the target document is then mapped to an element with the same name in the base architecture. Additional syntactical elements allow us to ignore the base architecture for certain child elements, to rename or ignore attributes, and to bridge references between ID IDREF attributes. The documentation in David Megginson’s XAF package describes these features in detail  Megginson 1998 .  It is, of course, not necessary to specify all these mappings in the doc- ument instance. We can easily deﬁne the attributes used to accomplish the mapping, such as Product=”name”, as ﬁxed-value attributes within the DTD or within an XML Schema. Similarly, we can deﬁne the processing instructions in the DTD or XML Schema, too. By using this technique, document instances do not differ from document instances that do not use architectural forms.  If we compare architectural forms with the reuse mechanisms found in  XML Schema, we ﬁnd the following:    XML  Schema  can  compose  a  new  schema  from  several  smaller schemata  and  type  libraries,  but  architectural  forms  cannot.  Rather they allow checking given document instances against a set of “guide- lines.”  Team-Fly®  AF vs. XML Schema   2.10 Best Practices  79    Architectural  forms  do  have  a  rename  mechanism  for  element  and attribute  names,  which  the  include and import facilities  in  XML Schema don’t offer. XML Schema, in contrast, has a redeﬁnition mech- anism, allowing the type of included elements to be changed.    With architectural forms a document element can claim conformance to  multiple  architectures  simultaneously.  This  is  not  possible  with XML Schema.  2.10 BEST PRACTICES  In this section, we list a number of best practices that are discussed in the XML community.  2.10.1 Always Use Namespaces  Small  schemata  are  likely  to  be  integrated  into  large  schemata.  Large schemata are often developed by separate work groups in a modular fash- ion. Because they prevent name conﬂicts, namespaces make it easier to assemble large schemata from smaller ones—even if the work group con- sists only of a single person. A good schema is very likely to be reused by others!  In  document  instances,  elements  should  always  be  qualiﬁed  with  a namespace, either by using a default namespace or by using a namespace preﬁx. This is not necessary for attributes because attribute names are de- ﬁned in relation to their context.  2.10.2 Do Not Reinvent the Wheel  Instead of designing every document type from scratch, use existing doc- ument types  if possible use industry standards  and extend these to your requirements.  This  will  save  you  a  lot  of  work,  will  usually  result  in higher-quality schema deﬁnitions, and will ensure that core concepts of your document are understood by others, too.  Most public repositories currently store XML schemas in the form of DTDs. Extending such a schema is done with the traditional means of cut and paste, since DTDs do not have an inheritance mechanism.  XML Schema has a powerful inheritance mechanism. Schema deﬁni- tions can be composed from schema modules using include and import. Complex  datatypes   i.e.,  nested  elements   can  be  extended;  that  is, attributes  and  child  elements  can  be  added.  The  wildcard  mechanism   80  Chapter 2 Groundwork      allows the deﬁnition of elements that follow a completely dif- ferent schema  of a different namespace .  Remember that deep inheritance hierarchies can become hard to read. In object-oriented programming, where inheritance is extensively used, this phenomenon is known as the “yo-yo effect”— you have to go up and down the inheritance hierarchy repeatedly to understand the result.  2.10.3 Multipart Schemata?  Some authors  in particular, see www.biztalk.org  warn against using multi- part schemata because they multiply the dependencies between software artifacts.  These  dependencies  can  make  a  system  hard  to  maintain. Things  can  get  very  complicated—especially  if  you  build  a  full  inheri- tance hierarchy for document types and you have to maintain a corre- sponding  taxonomy  of  Java   and or  C++,  JavaScript,  etc.   classes.   The same is true for architectural forms.  You could end up like Gulliver in Lil- liput, held down by thousands of strings and unable to move.  Others, however, advocate the use of multipart schemata to construct larger schemata from smaller components and type libraries  see, for ex- ample, www.xfront.com .  2.10.4 Avoid External Entities  Similarly,  external  entities  increase  the  dependencies  between  software artifacts. Additionally, not all XML processors  including some databases and messaging middleware  support external entities. For example, if you want  to  embellish  each  XML  document  of  a  site  with  some  corporate information, it will be better to postprocess the documents using an XSLT style sheet and add the required information in this way.  2.10.5 Never Change a Published Schema  This is a good practice exercised in component-oriented systems such as COM. Instead of changing a published schema and probably burning its users, create a new schema with each change. Be prepared for users to continue to use the old schema version for a considerable time period.  2.10.6 Use Only Version-Controlled Schemata  Schemata that are not controlled by a version control system can change at any time, leaving your application “out in the rain.” In particular, this   2.10 Best Practices  81  is the case when you use a schema from a public repository. Make sure that the repository has a version control system in place.  If you are using multipart schemata, make sure that all parts are con-  trolled by the same version control system.  2.10.7 Consider Equipping Each Document Element with a UUID Attribute  Universally unique identiﬁers  UUIDs  can be easily generated and can identify  objects  uniquely.  Equipping  each  element  in  a  document instance  with  such  a  UUID   as  an  attribute  of  type  ID   helps  to  easily identify an element. One advantage is that elements can keep their iden- tity  even  through  transformations   for  example,  with  XSLT ,  when merged with another document, or when moved to a different location.  2.10.8 Adopt a Concise Style for Schema Design  Here  are  a  few  recommendations  found  on  the  BizTalk.org  Web  site.  Other  communities  might  recommend  slightly  different  authoring styles.     Write  element  and  attribute  names  in  a  style  called  “CamelCase.” Elements  reﬂecting  an  entity  should  be  written  in  UpperCamelCase; elements  and  attributes  reﬂecting  a  property  should  be  written  in lowerCamelCase. For example:              ...     ...      Names should be meaningful. Names should describe the marked in- formation  item  sufﬁciently.  Avoid  cryptic  abbreviations.  There  is always a chance that humans will read the document, at least in the case of debugging. For example: do not write odate when you mean orderDate.    Elements  and  attributes  should  be  named  by  their  function,  not by their  position  in  a  set.  For  example:  do  not  write   ,  , and so on when you can write  ,  .  CamelCase  Meaningful names   82  Chapter 2 Groundwork  Avoid custom parsing    Do not use a complex string expression within elements that requires custom parsing. Rather, break the string into single tokens and express each token in a separate element. This will improve readability and ex- tensibility. It also allows you to apply datatype deﬁnitions to each ele- ment when deﬁning a schema with XML Schema.  Note: XML Schema allows the deﬁnition of list datatypes. Such list datatypes  allow  you  to  write  several  tokens  of  the  same  datatype within a single element, separated by whitespace.  For example: rather than writing    USD 9.95    write  Lists like  are okay.          USD     9.95      35 23 48 29 96 42    Later extensions    To model conceptual entity properties, use XML elements, not attri- butes. Attributes should be used for metadata such as element author, element version, element origin, modiﬁcation date, and so on.  But see our discussion in Section 2.9.2.   The reason for this is that an element is better suited for later exten- sion than an attribute. You can always insert child elements into an ex- isting element, but you cannot do so with an attribute.  2.10.9 Do Not Use Exotic Language Elements Use  only  language  elements  that  are  commonly  supported  by  existing tools such as parsers, editors, viewers, and so on. For some XML-based languages the W3C has published the results of conformance tests. These reports list which language features are supported by which tools. Using only features that are supported by most tools will improve portability of your documents.   2.11 XML Resources  83  2.11 XML RESOURCES  We have selected a few important Web sites that provide either an exten- sive range of XML resources or other important contributions.  The World Wide Web Consortium  www.w3.org  is the reference point for nearly every standard mentioned earlier—and more. In particular, in case you didn’t know: XML is a W3C recommendation.  www.megginson.com is the source for SAX, SAX2, and XAF. OASIS   www.oasis-open.org   is  a  clearinghouse  of  XML  industry  stan- dards. In particular OASIS  in collaboration with UN CEFACT  was respon- sible for the ebXML standard and hosts the RELAX-NG speciﬁcation.  Robin Cover’s page  www.oasis-open.org cover  , hosted by OASIS, con- tains  the  latest  XML-related  industry  news  and  discusses  new  industry standards.  Also hosted by OASIS, www.xml.org, is a repository for XML schemata. In  collaboration  with  ZapThink,  it  also  contains  descriptions  of  about 400 XML-based industry standards. This site also gives access to the XML- DEV discussion forum  www.xml.org xml xmldev.shtml .  www.xmlpatterns.com contains a collection of design patterns for XML. www.xml.com is  a  site  devoted  to  XML  and  related  standards  from  O’Reilly Publishers.  nologies.  www.xmlhack.com is  dedicated  to  news  related  to  XML  core  tech-  www.xfront.com discusses  programming  techniques  for  schema  au-  thors.

After revisiting  the  classic  entity  relationship  model,  we  introduce  asset-  oriented  modeling—an  approach  to  conceptual  modeling  that is speciﬁcally targeted at XML environments.  RDF  is  the  W3C’s  ofﬁcial  framework  to  model  complex  Web-based information structures and semantics. Currently,  RDF is undergoing a revision process that will result in a new  syntax and content model. If you are not particularly inter-  ested in RDF, you may want to skip Section 3.3.  Finally,  we  discuss  how  UML  can  be  utilized  with  XML.  UML is a de facto standard for object-oriented scenarios and  is also used in some XML applications such as ebXML as the  modeling method of choice.  85   86  Chapter 3 Structure  Rationale for this chapter  Paradigm shift  3.1 THE EVOLUTION OF DATA MODELS  Currently, the main role of XML is certainly that of a communication for- mat, but we also see applications for data storage and knowledge bases. The many proposals for an XML query language alone indicate that the application of XML is wider than pure message transmission. But even when used as a message format, modeling techniques become important: a BizTalk message, for example, is organized like a small database con- taining several business documents, business objects, and attachments.  Therefore in this chapter we take a close look at various modeling tech- niques. We think this is necessary because we know of many cases where schemata  were  designed  that  are  practically  unusable.  You  may  have heard  of  infamous  “all-in-one”  documents,  where  a  single  document contains all information entities found in the problem domain, resulting in document sizes of 50 MB and more.  We have seen schemata that disregard the hierarchical possibilities of XML  and  store  everything  as  a  network  of  elements  that  refer  to  each other via ID and IDREF attributes, resulting in unreadable documents.  So, data modeling is an issue for XML. And because XML is very ex- pressive, it allows us to adopt very intuitive modeling techniques. Given the current education of system and database analysts in relational mod- eling techniques, XML requires a rethink. Smashing complex objects into atomic pieces, as is done in the relational model, is not required for XML  in fact, it would cause poor performance and unreadable documents . That is the reason why we—after revisiting existing data models—return to the mother of all information modeling techniques, the entity rela- tionship model. In fact, this technique has been enhanced in the mean- time.  With  asset-oriented  modeling,  we  will  discuss  a  modeling  tech- nique that is more suitable for XML.  We continue here with our earlier thesis that a major paradigm shift is happening in computing. In Chapter 1 we stated that IT infrastructures moved from transactional architectures to client-server architectures in the 1980s and are now moving from client-server architectures toward navigational systems. This shift is reﬂected by fundamental changes in data structures:    Transactional  architectures  are  characterized  by  the  hierarchical  and the network  CODASYL  data models. These models started to evolve in the 1960s and are still in use today. Large amounts of operational data still reside in database systems such as IMS.   3.1 The Evolution of Data Models  87    Client-server architectures were characterized by relational data mod- els. Relational databases became the standard database technology in the 1980s and dominated the database market in the 1990s. The rela- tional data model structures information in a way that allows different clients to interpret data items in various combinations.    Navigational IT architectures require a new data model, which is still evolving. It seems that data models based on regular grammars  Daum 2002  are promising. At least, XML ﬁts into this category.  3.1.1 CODASYL  CODASYL DBTG  Conference on Data System Languages Data Base Task Group  dates back to 1971  Olle 1978  and was the basis for many data- base  implementations,  including  IDMS   Cullinet ,  DMS-1100   Sperry Univac , IDS II  Honeywell , and UDS  Siemens .  In CODASYL schemas are deﬁned with the Data Deﬁnition Language  DDL ,  while  operations  on  the  data  are  expressed  through  the  Data Manipulation  Language   DML .  Language  bindings  exist  to  COBOL, FORTRAN, and others.  CODASYL  data  structures  are  closely  related  to  the  classical  COBOL data record: A record consists of one or several items. Each item may have one or several occurrences  repeating group . Each record has a permanent internal identiﬁcation  database key , allowing fast localization of records. Sets deﬁne the relationship between records. Each set has one owner record  or “system” for the root owner record  and one or several member records. This restricts relationships to 1:1 and 1: n relationships. As shown in Figure 3.1 a , n: m relationships must be modeled by deﬁning two 1: n sets and one dummy record.  Although the relationship between records within a set is strictly hier- archical, there is no global hierarchy between records. By deﬁning several sets, a record may have several owners  Figure 3.1 b  , or records may mu- tually own each other  Figure 3.1 c  . It is also possible to deﬁne several differently named set types on the same record types  Figure 3.1 d  .  The record-oriented storage format makes CODASYL databases highly efﬁcient. This is one of the reasons why a substantial amount of opera- tional data is still stored in this format.  The problem with CODASYL databases, however, is their inﬂexibility. New  requirements  almost  always  require  remodeling  the  data  schema. This may affect existing applications and requires extensive integration tests.

Team-Fly®   3.1 The Evolution of Data Models  89  The change of a data schema subsequently requires a reorganization of the physical database, meaning considerable downtime for the connected applications.  3.1.2 Hierarchical Databases  Hierarchical databases are similar to CODASYL databases. The main dif- ference is that the database consists of a set of hierarchical trees. If the same record is contained in several trees or tree branches, one record is determined to be the main record. Its copies are mirrored through the use of pointer records. Thus, the redundancies in the database are removed.  A typical example of a hierarchical database system is IBM’s IMS.  Pointers  3.1.3 Relational Databases  The  relational  concept  is  based  on  a  simple  idea:  the  database  should store data in the most atomic form, while the data structures are imposed on  the  data  by  the  client   application .  This  concept  ﬁts  well  into  the client-server approach, which began to evolve in the 1980s with the ap- pearance of workstations and desktop computers that are connected to a central database server. Different clients thus can utilize the same data items in many different constellations. The introduction of new applica- tions does not require the reorganization of the physical database. Popu- lar representatives of this database model are IBM’s DB2 and the Oracle database management system.  Relational technology is based on a sound mathematical theory—the relational algebra introduced by E. F. Codd in 1970  Codd 1970 . In rela- tional databases data is organized in tables. Each table represents a basic relationship  between  primitive  data  items  such  as  customer  name  and customer  number.  Tables  have  rows  called tuples in  relational  algebra  and columns  attributes . The attributes are named via a schema deﬁni- tion; the rows, however, remain anonymous and unordered. Rows can be selected by content via a key.  Preparing data models for relational databases requires a sequence of normalization steps. Each step splits complex data structures into simpler constructs  and  reduces  redundancies  and  dependencies  between  data items.  The  example  in  Database  Table  3.1,  Orders-by-Supplier,  shows  a schema deﬁnition with the attributes SUPPLIER, NAME, CITY, SIZE, OR- DERS. As it is, this example table cannot be stored in most rational data-  Tables   Chapter 3 Structure  90  1NF  base  management  systems   RDBMSs   because  it  is  not  in  ﬁrst  normal form   1NF .  A  table  is  said  to  be  in  ﬁrst  normal  form  if  all  attributes  columns  are atomic. The column ORDERS contains nonelementary val- ues. It is therefore necessary to decompose this table into several tables.  The problem here is that the column ORDERS contains lists of element tuples. Lists are by deﬁnition ordered: list elements have a clearly deﬁned sequence.  Table  rows,  however,  do  not  have  a  natural  sequence.  If  we want to translate the list into a table structure, we have to introduce an additional attribute, POSITION, to maintain the original position of each  Database Table 3.1 Unnormalized Database Table  for Orders-by-Supplier Schema.

This would allow an application to reconstruct the original se- quence by using a SORT operator  see Database Table 3.2 .  Because this table combines supplier information with order data, it  exhibits several anomalies:    Supplier information cannot be stored without storing an order.   When all orders of a supplier are deleted, the supplier information is    When  the  address  of  a  supplier  changes,  all  orders  referring  to  that  lost.  supplier must be updated.  Similar anomalies exist for the product information. For example, if all orders  for  a  product  are  deleted,  we  lose  the  information  about  which product name belongs to which product number and who supplies which product.  At this point it becomes necessary to talk about keys. Unlike in CODA- SYL  and  hierarchical  databases,  where  pointers  reference  a  physical record  a rudimentary form of object identity , keys in relational systems relate to content. A primary key is a single attribute or a combination of attributes that can identify a single row. In our example above, the com- bination of SUPPLIER and PRODUCT is a suitable primary key.  A 1NF table is said to be in second normal form  2NF  if all attributes depend fully on the primary key. This is not the case in Database Table 3.2. The attribute CITY depends only on SUPPLIER, not on the combi- nation of SUPPLIER and PRODUCT. To obtain 2NF, we have to decom- pose the table Orders-by-Supplier into the three tables Orders, Suppliers, and Products  Database Tables 3.3–3.5 .

However, the knowledge of how suppliers and products relate to orders is no longer contained in the database and must be provided by the appli- cation using this data.  The next step in the normalization process is the third normal form  3NF . A table is said to be in 3NF if none of the attributes depends tran- sitively from a primary key. If, for example, the SIZE attribute in the table Suppliers  Database Table 3.3  relates to the supplier, the table is already in 3NF. But if SIZE relates to CITY, then SIZE depends transitively  via CITY  from SUPPLIER. In this case we have to—you may have guessed it—decompose  again   see  Database  Tables  3.6  and  3.7 .  Otherwise,  we would  lose  information  about  cities  when  we  delete  a  supplier  from the table.  3NF  Database Table 3.6 3NF Database Table for Suppliers.

We  will  stop  at  this  point—the  advantages  and drawbacks of the relational method are already clear.  Cleanly  separating  mixed  information  into  individual  tables  allows client applications to apply any kind of queries without having to modify the underlying database schema. This is not possible in CODASYL data- bases: in these databases the access paths must be explicitly deﬁned in the set deﬁnitions.  By using standard SQL queries it would be possible to interrogate our  database for    suppliers for a given order position   orders for a given product   orders for a given supplier   products coming from “Leads”   products supplied by suppliers in small cities  However, this ﬂexibility comes at a price. First, database operations will be relatively slow. To read all orders from supplier Softtouch we would need ﬁve select operations, four join operations, and one sort operation. Therefore, during the design of a relational database, the sequence of nor- malization steps is usually followed by a series of denormalization and op- timization steps, with the goal of obtaining a less fragmented physical data storage. The art of relational database design lies in ﬁnding the right compromise between ﬂexibility and performance.  Second, while normalization removes the anomalies discussed earlier, it  also  loses  structural  information  contained  in  the  conceptual  data model.  In  some  cases  foreign primary  key  relationships  can  maintain some of this information. In many cases, however, structural information is hidden as join operations in applications and query expressions. For example,  a  foreign primary  key  relationship  cannot  model  a  many-to- many relationship.  The loss of structural information introduces integrity problems. After normalization a DBMS has no knowledge about the structural relation- ship between tables. Therefore the DBMS cannot control the structural integrity of the data. Deleting a CITIES tuple, for example, would leave suppliers homeless.  Relational database management systems solve this problem by rein- troducing structural information into the schema deﬁnition in the form of  integrity  rules  and  triggers.  These  constraints  and  triggers  allow  the database system to reject violating operations or to perform additional operations that are required to keep the structure of the database intact.  Costs  Integrity   3.1 The Evolution of Data Models  95  For example, we could inhibit the deletion of any CITIES tuples that are referenced by SUPPLIER tuples. Or, when a SUPPLIER is deleted we could trigger the deletion of the referenced CITIES tuple if it is not referenced by other SUPPLIER tuples. It is clear that these constraints introduce ad- ditional overhead.  XML, in contrast, does not deﬁne such mechanisms. In this respect, SQL is a more mature technology. But, on the other hand, in many cases these mechanisms are not required in XML. With XML, since it is not necessary to “ﬂatten” complex structures into third normal form, partial deletion or modiﬁcation of an information structure in a database is less likely. However, to maintain the integrity of a whole information model, rules for referential integrity are required.  3.1.4 Navigational Architectures  The explosive growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web has led to a technology shift similar to that generated by the introduction of the personal computer one and a half decades ago. But progress does not stop there. At the end of the decade, practically every person in the industrial countries,  and  a  considerable  percentage  of  people  in  the  rest  of  the world, will own one or more devices to access the Internet. When wire- less technology starts to outperform standard telephone lines by orders of magnitude,  this  access  will  probably  be  wireless.  Or,  embedded  into  a device, it will do its work unnoticed by the user.  Because these devices must be cheap, mobile, and almost disposable, many of them will be built as thin clients  with rich multimedia and zero deployment for user friendliness, though  with a browser  perhaps a voice browser   interface—or,  in  the  case  of  embedded  devices,  as  very  thin servers. The storage of strategic data and processing of information will be the duty of a vast grid of highly specialized servers, connected through powerful ﬁber optics backbones. At the same time, these devices will also be able to share their local resources with others. Although currently this is mostly done with MP3 records, the technology is not restricted to this format  see Section 7.4 .  This scenario may remotely resemble the transactional scenario of the 1970s  where  thin  clients   the  famous  green-black  screens   were  con- nected to powerful mainframes  powerful in the terms of the past, that is . However, there is a major difference: through the Internet the clients of today are connected not just to a single server but to a network of mil- lions  of  information  sources.  These  shareable  information  sources  are highly  heterogeneous  in  nature.  It  is  unlikely  that  there  will  ever  be  a  Thin devices  Networks   96  Chapter 3 Structure  New requirements  ferent  Bayardo et al. 1997 :  common global formal model of control, administration, or registration of information sources. In addition, content, format, and availability of these information sources are under constant change.  This scenario contrasts radically with traditional enterprise scenarios consisting of multiple distributed heterogeneous database systems and data  warehouses.  In  these  systems,  global  data  schemata  are  designed and decided on a priori. Databases connected to the system must comply with the global schema. “Global” in this context, of course, means “en- terprisewide,” not “worldwide.”  In the world of electronic business, however, the requirements are dif-  .  .  .  recent  emerging  technologies  such  as  internetworking  and  the  World Wide Web have signiﬁcantly expanded the types, availability, and volume of data available to an information management system. Furthermore, in these new environments, there is no formal control over the registration of new information  sources,  and  applications  tend  to  be  developed  without  com- plete knowledge of the resources that will be available when they are run. The data and the structure may bear little relationship to the semantics. There- fore, there can be no static mapping of concepts to structured data sets, and querying is reduced to search engines that dynamically locate relevant infor- mation based on keywords.  To  establish,  for  example,  a  customer-supplier  relationship  over  the  Internet requires the following steps:    Locate a supplier that provides the required services. For example: Find a supplier in the immediate vicinity of Los Angeles who can supply up to 5,000 yellow toothbrushes every two weeks. Today this is done via digital marketplaces  see Chapter 10 .    Negotiate  a  common  trade  protocol   this  includes  common  process  and data models and common semantics  with the supplier found.    Construct  collaborating  workﬂows  that  orchestrate  the  cooperation  with this supplier.    Inform  partners  during  the  cooperation  about  relevant  changes  in  business process and data model.  All of these steps add requirements to a suitable data model:    Metainformation must be in a format suitable for publishing to pro- spective partners. Metainformation describes data elements, data struc- tures, authorship, version, origin, and so on. This is probably the most vital issue. In an open environment such as the Internet, it would be naive to believe that a single data format can ﬁt all purposes  see also  Publishing metadata   3.1 The Evolution of Data Models  97  Chapter 1 . Publishing the “blueprint” of the information model  the conceptual model  together with the information set enables clients— users, software agents, and mediators—to construct their own “mind map” of the information sources and to perform searches and transfor- mations efﬁciently.    To enable public access to metadata, the relationships between infor- mation  elements  must  be  deﬁned  independently  of  the  application. This is not the case with the relational model, where knowledge about the information structures is hardwired within applications. Metadata can either be published as an intrinsic part of a document itself, as is partly the case with XML documents, or it can be published separately, as is the case with conceptional models  see, for example, WebML in Section 7.1.2 , XML schemata  see DTD and XML Schema in Chapter 2 ,  or  metadata  descriptions   see  RDF  in  Section  3.3 .  For  electronic business, dedicated standards like WSDL  Section 6.6.3 , UDDI  Section 7.3 , or ebXML  Section 10.3  exist to publish metadata.    Users should be allowed to add knowledge to published metadata, for example, to deﬁne new relationships between information elements or to add a note to a certain document type. This is necessary because no designer or system analyst can anticipate all possible use cases.    When querying data, it must be possible to control the choice of selec- tion  criteria  and  of  the  access  paths  to  information  elements   apart from security considerations  completely with a query expression. This is the case in the relational data model, but not in the CODASYL data model, where only predeﬁned access paths  sets  can be used.    Document repositories should be able to maintain the integrity of doc- uments and the referential integrity between documents. Referential integrity between the documents within an enterprise is an absolute requirement.  In  the  open  world  of  the  World  Wide  Web,  however, maintaining  full  referential  integrity  is  not  always  possible—we  all know the all-too-common 404 response code.    Documents should be easy to transform into different structures. This is  important  if  we  want  to  exchange  business  documents  with  part- ners, and if these documents follow different standards.    The  deﬁnition  of  business  objects  must  recognize  the  different  con- texts and environments the business object can interact with. This re- quirement is unique to the open world of electronic business, where the same business object can pass through several environments, for example, in a supply chain scenario. Such a scenario can span across several countries and continents, where different legal and administra- tive contexts exist that business objects have to satisfy.  Annotation  Flexible queries  Integrity  Transformations  Context awareness   98  Chapter 3 Structure  Standard formats  Document format vs. record format    All  data  formats   including  metadata   should  comply  with  interna- tional standards. Proprietary formats are counterproductive in an open environment. However, because standardization is a slow process and because standards often cover only the smallest common denomina- tor, the use of proprietary formats is sometimes inevitable. The better choice, of course, is to extend a standard format rather than to com- pletely roll your own.  XML and XML- based technology ﬁt well into this scenario. XML has its  roots  in  the  document  standard  SGML,  and  document-oriented formats  are  what  is  required  here.  For  thousands  of  years  information exchange between organizations was organized through document-based formats. The storage of information within an enterprise, in contrast, was organized  through  the  use  of  index-card-based   or  record-based   for- mats—even long before electronic data processing.  Y  CODASYL and relational databases mimic the index-card-oriented for- mat  and  are  therefore  well  suited  to  cover  data  storage  requirements within the enterprise. Records and tables closely resemble the classic in- dex card box, where only the owner of the box knows how to interpret the data. XML breaks radically with this tradition. XML documents can be self-explanatory to human readers and are designed to be interpreted by external partners.  T  E  A  F L  M  Let’s see how XML and related standards satisfy the requirements out-  lined in the bulleted list above:  Publishing metadata    Metainformation must be in a format suitable for publishing to prospective partners. Metainformation describes data elements, data structures, author- ship, version, origin, and so on.  XML documents contain substantial metadata within a document. Named tags enclose every document element. Attributes can optionally be used to specify additional metainformation such as author or ver- sion for each element. Documents can have an arbitrary tree structure because document elements can be nested. Thus, a certain amount of metainformation is automatically published with each document.  Additional metadata can be published through XML schema deﬁni- tions such as DTDs or XML Schema deﬁnitions. This schema informa- tion  can  be  used  to  optimize  query  processing,  to  obtain  a  mental model of the document type, to visualize the document structure, and to control editing tools when documents are created and modiﬁed.  Where XML falls short is in the deﬁnition of constraints that go be-  yond datatypes and cross-references.  Team-Fly®   3.1 The Evolution of Data Models  99    To enable public access to metadata, the relationships between information  elements must be deﬁned independently of the application.  The relationships between document elements are deﬁned by the intrinsic document structure and are thus contained in the document. However,  due  to  the  hierarchical  structure  of  XML  documents,  not every relationship can be expressed in terms of the parent-child ele- ment relationship. Also, the basic XML 1.0 standard does not deﬁne provisions to specify relations to external information items such as other XML documents and non-XML objects.  In the following sections we discuss how to express relationships— especially  relationships  in  the  context  of  conceptual  modeling—be- tween documents. Relationships should be best expressed as separate “data maps” apart from the information elements.    Users should be allowed to add knowledge to published metadata.  Annotation  RDF  see Section 3.3  allows making statements about information items  in fact any resource  and publishing that knowledge. Also, topic maps  see Section 7.2  provide a mechanism to add knowledge to in- formation items.    When querying data, it must be possible to control the choice of selection cri- teria and of the access paths to information elements  apart from security considerations  completely with a query expression.  Flexible queries  While  XML  documents  adhere  to  a  strictly  hierarchical  structure with nested elements, XPath query constructs allow the use of any ele- ment or element combination within an XML document as a selection criterion,  and  access  to  single  elements  within  an  XML  document. However, although XPath is very powerful, it is not a full query lan- guage. There are deﬁciencies in the area of text retrieval, there is no join  operator,  and  the  aggregating  functions  known  from  SQL  are missing.  Several  proposals  for  dedicated  XML  query  languages  have been made in the past. With XQuery, a W3C standard is now on the way  see Section 2.6 .    Document repositories should be able to maintain the integrity of documents  Integrity  and the referential integrity between documents.  Although XML processors can validate the structural integrity of a document  against  its  schema  deﬁnition   DTD  or  XML  Schema ,  se- mantic integrity and referential integrity are still weak points in XML. While relational technology provides a standard way to add semantic   100  Chapter 3 Structure  and referential integrity via integrity rules and triggers, XML reposito- ries currently require application logic or the deﬁnition of proprietary server extensions to implement semantic and referential integrity.  Transformations    Documents should be easy to transform into different structures.  The XSLT style sheet language allows the formulation of powerful document transformations. In Chapter 9 we will discuss XLST in more detail.  In  Section  3.2  we  explain  how  to  normalize  models  to  allow document transformations without information loss.  Context awareness    The deﬁnition of business objects must recognize the different contexts and  environments the business object can interact with.  The  Schema  Adjunct  Framework   SAF   deﬁnes  a  two-layered  ap- proach to add behavior to XML documents. SAF allows the deﬁnition of abstract operations that are interpreted by context-speciﬁc proces- sors. We will discuss SAF in more detail in Section 4.4.2.  ebXML deﬁnes business objects in relation to speciﬁc contexts. It identiﬁes a set of context drivers for business applications. We discuss ebXML in detail in Section 10.3.  Standard formats  standards.    All  data  formats   including  metadata   should  comply  with  international  XML  and  the  related  speciﬁcations  are  W3C  standards  and  have wide industry support. Topic maps are an ISO standard. There are sev- eral de facto industry standards for the exchange of business data, but the ebXML format is a UN CEFACT standard.  Because XML is a document standard and documents have the pur- pose of being exchanged, data modeling is only one aspect of an XML architecture. Other aspects are the deﬁnition of process models, com- munication models, and navigation models. We will discuss these as- pects in Chapters 5, 6, and 7.  3.2 CONCEPTUAL MODELING  Conceptual modeling is an early but important step in the design of in- formation systems. While originally applied only to databases, concep- tual  modeling  techniques  are  now  applied  to  object-oriented  systems, too. In this section we will see how conceptual modeling can be utilized for XML-based architectures.   3.2 Conceptual Modeling  101  3.2.1 The Entity Relationship Model  Usefulness from what is not there. —Lao-Tse  Developed by Peter Chen in the 1970s, entity relationship modeling  ERM  can be considered to be the ancestor of all modern modeling methods  Chen 1976 . The acronym ERD may be more popular—meaning entity re- lationship diagram, the graphical representation of an entity relationship model.  In the years following its original conception ERM has spun off many   ~80  children and grandchildren. Among them are the following:    Nijssen’s  Information  Analysis  Methodology  NIAM   eventually  became  Object Role Modeling  ORM   Halpin 1999 .    Semantic  Object  Modeling  SOM   was  developed  by  David  Kroenke   1995  during the same period of time.    Information engineering was developed by Clive Finkelstein and became  popular through collaboration with James Martin  Martin 1993 .    The  Uniﬁed  Modeling  Language  UML   was  published  by  the  Object Management Group in 1997  Booch, Jacobson, and Rumbaugh 1997 . UML covers the wide area of object-oriented modeling including dy- namic  aspects.  The  data  modeling  part,  however,  closely  resembles ERM. Because UML has become a de facto modeling standard in OO system design, we will discuss it in Section 3.4 in detail. UML was sub- mitted to the International Standards Organization to become an ISO standard.    The Higher Order Entity Relationship Model  HERM  by Bernhard Thal- heim  was  developed  in  the  1990s   Thalheim  2000 .  Unlike  the  rela- tively informal ERM, HERM has a solid mathematical foundation.  Most of the later developments based on ERM had the goal of improv- ing the conceptual design method for relational databases and, as it be- came popular, for object-oriented programming. Because the document metaphor established by SGML and XML does not really ﬁt into the rela- tional or object-oriented philosophy, we will refrain at this point from any discussion of any specialized modeling method and go back to the roots.  ERM  Thalheim 1999  models the world in terms of entities, attributes, and relationships. The scope of ERM, at the time it became popular, was to deﬁne  an  enterprise  data  model,  or  enterprise  scheme,  representing  the overall logical structure of the enterprise database.  ERM spinoffs  ERM explained   102  Chapter 3 Structure  Dominant entities  Entities Chen described entities as “. . . a ‘thing’ which can be distinctly identi- ﬁed.” Chen also said: “There are many ‘things’ in the real world. It is the responsibility of the database designer to select the entity types which are most suitable for his her company.”  The vagueness of this deﬁnition made ERM, in fact, a very generic con- cept and has probably led to the overwhelming success of the method by inviting dozens of researchers to try to improve it.  To be a bit more verbose: An entity is an object that is distinguishable from other objects. Entities have attributes that make them distinguishable. An entity may be a concrete object such as a person, a machine, a building, and so on, or it may be an abstract notion such as a project, a holiday, a nation, an account, and so on.  ERM differentiates between dominant entities and subordinate entities. Dominant entities exist in their own right; the existence of a subordinate entity depends on another entity. In commercial programming dominant entities are also called business objects.  Entity Set An entity set is a set of entities of the same type, for example, a set of cus- tomers, a set of invoices, a set of trucks, and so on. Entity sets can over- lap:  an  entity  can  belong  to  more  than  one  entity  set.  For  example,  a student tutor belongs to both entity sets, students and teachers.  In ERM diagrams, entity sets are displayed as rectangles  see Figure 3.2 .  Attributes Entities  may  have  attributes.  In  fact,  there  are  no  entities  without  at- tributes because attributes characterize entities: they deﬁne the type of an entity. An attribute consists of an attribute name and an atomic attribute value, for example, Price: 19.95. Formally, an attribute is a function that maps a set of entities onto a value domain.   In an ERM diagram, attributes are displayed as ellipsoids connected by straight lines to the owning entity sets, resulting in the typical ERM mil- lipedes  see Figure 3.3 .  Customer  Product  Figure 3.2 Entity sets in an ERM diagram.   3.2 Conceptual Modeling  103  CustomerID  Price  Customer  Product  Attribute vs. entity  Name  Phone  Name  Number  Figure 3.3 Entity sets with attributes.  In some cases it is difﬁcult to decide what should be modeled as an attribute and what as a separate entity. Consider the entity Driver. The driver’s license could be modeled as an attribute of Driver. Alternatively it could be modeled as a separate entity. The second solution would re- quire the deﬁnition of an extra relationship holds_license but allows the detailed  modeling  of  the  actual  license.  In  the  ﬁrst  case  we  can  only model the license as an atomic value, presumably the license number, be- cause attribute values must be atomic.  We will see that the same discussion pops up again with the question of  whether  to  use  attributes  or  elements  to  specify  content  within  an XML document. The question of whether an item should be modeled as an entity or as an attribute can only be decided on the basis of the con- text in which the data model will be used. Generally, an item should be modeled as an entity if it plays a role within a business process.  Keys An  attribute  or  a  combination  of  attributes  that  uniquely  identiﬁes  an entity is called a superkey. The smallest possible superkey  i.e., a superkey for which no subset of attributes exists that can act as a superkey  is called a candidate key. From the set of candidate keys, database designers can select a primary key to identify an entity within an entity set.  Entity sets that do not possess a primary key are called weak entity sets. Entity sets that do have a primary key are called strong entity sets. This concept  is  closely  related  to  dominant  and  subordinate  entities.  Weak  Strong and weak entity sets   104  Chapter 3 Structure  Account  Transaction  Figure 3.4 Subordinate entity Transaction.  entity sets consist of subordinate entities, while strong entity sets consist of dominant entities.  Consider, for example, the entities Account and Transaction. A transac- tion is usually identiﬁed with a transaction number that is unique only in the context of a given account. The set of Transaction entities therefore forms a weak entity set. Clearly, Transaction entities are subordinate to Account entities.  In  an  ERM  diagram  weak  entity  sets  are  displayed  with  a  double-  outlined rectangle  see Figure 3.4 .  The original ERM version did not deﬁne a special notation for keys.  Later versions mark unique attributes with double-outlined ellipsoids.  Relationships Peter  Chen  stated:  “Relationships  may  exist  between  entities”   Chen 1976 . There is a little more to add: relationships associate two or more entities  with  each other.  For  example,  given  the  entities  Customer and Product,  the  relationship  Order denotes  a  speciﬁc  association  between customers and products.  Within a relationship each entity has a particular role. In our example the  customer  entity  issues an  order,  while  the  product  is  subject  to  an order.  Relationships  have  an  arity: relationships  associating  two  roles  are called binary, relationships associating three roles are called ternary, and so on.  ERM allows the deﬁnition of certain constraints for relationships: roles have a cardinality. Roles can be restricted to incorporate a single entity, or they may incorporate multiple entities. In a binary relationship this re- sults  in  four  different  constraints:  one-to-one,  one-to-many,  many-to- one,  and  many-to-many.  Our  orders relationship  is  typically  a  one-to- many relationship because a single customer can order several product items. In addition, roles may be optional. That is, the role incorporates single or multiple entities only in some situations. In a binary relation- ship this results in 16 different constraints.  Role  Arity  Constraints   3.2 Conceptual Modeling  105  CustomerID  OrderNumber  Price  Customer  orders  Product  Name  Phone  Name  Number  Figure 3.5 Order relation between Customer and Product.  Relationships may have attributes, too. For example, the relationship  orders may possess the attribute OrderNumber.  Relationship Set A relationship set is a set of relationships of the same type, for example, all existing orders from a given set of customers to a given set of products. In an ERM diagram, relationship sets are displayed as diamonds and are connected by lines to the entities participating in the relationship  see Figure 3.5 . The cardinality of a relationship is shown with an arrow. An arrow  pointing  to  an  entity  denotes  the  “one”  side  of  a  relationship. Lines without arrows denote the “many” side of a relationship.  Later improvements to the ERM model replace the arrowheads with numbers below the connecting lines. This allows the speciﬁcation of the minimum  and  maximum  number  of  entity  occurrences   cardinality  within  a  role;  for  example,   1,n   would  typically  replace  the  “one-to- many”  speciﬁcation.  This  notation  also  allows  the  speciﬁcation  of  op- tional roles:  0,1  speciﬁes a cardinality of minimum 0 and maximum 1, making the role optional.  Existence-Dependent Relationship This relationship is one of three that are treated special in ERM  the other two are aggregation and generalization, to be discussed shortly . It deﬁnes the  special  relationship  between  associated  dominant  and  subordinate  Cardinality   106  Chapter 3 Structure  Account  E  Transaction  Figure 3.6 Existence-dependent relationship between Account and Transaction.  entities. Subordinate entities can only exist if the dominant entity exists. For example, Transaction entities for an Account entity only exist if the Account entity exists.  In ERM, existence-dependent relationships are depicted in the form of a diamond like any other relationship but with the predeﬁned name “E”  see Figure 3.6 .  Aggregation Aggregation is a special form of relationship. What is special here is that an  association  of  aggregated  entities  is  treated  as  a  higher-level  entity itself. Often, subordinate entities are aggregated with a dominant entity and thus form a new complex entity. However, it is also possible to aggre- gate several dominant entities into a new higher-level entity. For exam- ple, the entities Customer and Product and the relationship orders could be aggregated into a new entity Order.  In an ERM diagram aggregations are depicted as ERM diagrams within  a rectangle  see Figure 3.7 .  Generalization Generalization is a special form of relationship that relates entities to an abstract entity. For example, a customer may order products or services. We  can  model  this  by  introducing  an  abstract  entity ProductOrService and associating the concrete entities Product and Service via an IS_A rela- tionship to ProductOrService. Although not covered as a special concept in the original version of ERM, generalization is depicted in later ERM versions in the form of triangles  see Figure 3.8 .  This original ERM notation is still in use today, predominantly at uni- versities and in the scientiﬁc community. Industry has adopted notations of later ERM ﬂavors, for example, the crow’s foot notation  see Figure 3.9 . The most striking difference is that attributes are displayed within en- tities and that relationships are displayed as a straight decorated line. This  Alternative notations   3.2 Conceptual Modeling  107  OrderNumber  Order  CustomerID  Price  Customer  orders  Product  Name  Phone  Name  Number  receives  DepNo  Department  Figure 3.7 Aggregation of the “orders” relationship into a new complex entity.  makes it difﬁcult to denote attributed relationships. Attributed relation- ships are therefore modeled as separate entities  see Figure 3.10 .  UML uses yet another notation.

AOM is loosely based on the higher order entity relationship model  HERM , introduced by Bernhard Thalheim during the 1990s  Thalheim 2000 . This method was developed for object-oriented modeling and in- cludes modeling techniques for structure as well as for semantics, such as constraints and operations. It introduces a solid mathematical founda- tion into conceptual modeling.  Because HERM  and thus AOM  allows complex, structured attributes within entities, the structure of an AOM model can be very close to the  Team-Fly®   3.2 Conceptual Modeling  109  Entity  Relation  EntityName  Key Other attributes  RelationName  EntityName  Key Other attributes  "one"  Existence dependent  Option  "many"  Figure 3.9 Elements of the crow’s foot notation.

This,  and  the  fact  that  HERM  and thus AOM  allows the deﬁnition of higher-order associations  i.e., associations of associations , leads to much simpler models than those obtained with ERM. AOM, in addition, does away with the artiﬁcial sepa- ration between entity type and relationship type.  It was E. F. Codd who stated that there is no reason to distinguish between entity type and rela- tionship type  Codd 1991 .  AOM also introduces a notation and an in- formation model based on regular expressions that are closer to XML and that extend the ﬂexibility of the method considerably.  Core Concepts AOM is based on three core concepts: properties, assets, and arcs.   110  Chapter 3 Structure  Properties  Properties can be either simple attributes or can be rather complex and deeply structured. A property can be compared to a node  element  in an XML document. We use the following notation to specify properties:  Assets  is-a relationships  Structure Sequence  ordered   name …   child1,…,childn   child1&…&childn  Bag  unordered   child1…childn  Alternative + * ? [n..m] lab{} lab  Repetition  1 . . . n  Repetition  0 . . . n  Optional  0 . . . 1  Arbitrary cardinality  n . . . m  with 0 ≤ n ≤ m Label deﬁnition Label reference   Labels  are  used  to  deﬁne  recursive  property  structures.  For  example, lab{part lab* } deﬁnes a treelike part list of arbitrary depth.   Assets cover  both  entities  and  relationships.  This  means  that  tradi- tional relationships known from ERM are treated as assets, too.  In terms of  logic  this  means  that  relationships  are  immediately  reiﬁed.   The advantage is that this way we can deﬁne relationships between relation- ships and can classify relationships, both of which the classic ERM can- not  do.  We  use  rounded  rectangles  to  visualize  an  asset  and  unidirec- tional arcs to visualize how they relate to other assets  see Figure 3.11 .  There are two exceptions that are not modeled as assets: the is-a rela- tionship and the has relationship between a dominant entity and a weak entity. These relationships simply become arcs between the two assets in- volved in those relationships as shown in Figure 3.12. For an is-a rela- tionship the subordinate asset points to the parent asset, while for a has relationship  the  dominant  asset  points  to  the  weak  asset.  However,  in many cases weak entities simply degenerate into a structured property of an asset.  The is-a relationship and the has relationship look very similar, indeed. In fact, they do almost the same thing. However, there is a subtle differ- ence: in a has relationship an asset acquires the whole target asset, while in an is-a relationship an asset acquires only the properties of the target asset. We therefore denote an is-a relationship with the role name “is-a.” In addition, each asset has a primary key. Keys consist of a single prop- erty  or  a  combination  of  properties.  Composite  keys  are  denoted  as property sets within curly brackets, for example, {ﬁrst-name, last-name}.   3.2 Conceptual Modeling  111  Product ProductNo ProductNo Name Price Currency,   Amount +  Asset Name  Keys  Properties  Constraints  Figure 3.11 Visualization of an asset type. The constraint area is reserved for additional integrity constraints. They can be informal or formal speciﬁcations, for example, OCL expressions or Schematron  see Section 2.9.1  constraint rules.  Similar to the notation used for properties, we use DTD syntax to de- note the cardinality of the relations between assets, as shown in Figure 3.13.  + * ? n..m  1..n 0..n 0..1 n..m  The  last  notation,  n..m, asks  for  an  XML  Schema  implementation, since DTDs cannot easily express this type of constraint. Note that this type of constraint can lead to models whose set of constraints can never be satisﬁed.  Arcs connect assets with each other. Each arc is unidirectional. In addi-  Arcs  tion, an arc can be labeled with a role name at the source end.  HERM introduces an additional construct into modeling that we also use in AOM: clusters. Clusters are a union of disjoint asset types. Clusters replace the generalization construct found in ERM and are denoted by a circle containing the character “”  the XML choice operator .  See Fig- ure 3.14.   Clusters  Advantages AOM has the following advantages over classical modeling methods:    Because  relationships  are  also  represented  as  assets,  deﬁning  higher-  order relationships  relationships between relationships  is trivial.   112  Chapter 3 Structure  Person  Name Name    FirstName,   LastName  PhoneNo*  is-a Customer CustomerID  CustomerID  Account AccountNo AccountNo Balance  Product ProductNo ProductNo Name Price Currency,   Amount +  Order  OrderNo OrderNo  Figure 3.12 The properties Person Name and Product Price exhibit a deeper structure than is possible in traditional ERM diagrams. We use the notation known from XML DTDs to denote cardinality of properties, subproperties, and relations. Hence, a customer can have multiple phone numbers, and a product has one or multiple price entries  for different currencies . Classical entity types  Person, Customer, Account, Product  and relationship types  Order  are all modeled as asset types. The relationship between the dominant entity Customer and the weak entity Account degenerates to a simple arc. The same is the case for the classical is-a relationship between Customer and Person.    Similarly, it is easy to deﬁne classiﬁcations over relationships  e.g., the relationship between Director and Manager would belong to the class of relationships between Employer and Employee .    n-ary relationships  with n > 2  don’t create problems.   Implementation in XML is straightforward.   Reverse engineering of relational databases is easy.   3.2 Conceptual Modeling  113  Product ProductNo ProductNo Name Price Currency,   Amount +  Customer CustomerID CustomerID Name    FirstName,   LastName  PhoneNo*  Department DepartmentNo DepartmentNo Name  forwards  RefNo  RefNo  Position  Amount  Order  OrderNo OrderNo  +  receives  RefNo RefNo  Figure 3.13 AOM diagram for a more complete Order example  Person and Account left out . We use the notation known from XML DTDs to denote cardinality of relations between assets. A department can receive multiple orders, and each order contains at least one position. Note that what would traditionally be modeled as a weak entity type—Position—is simply modeled as an asset type connected to Order.  A more detailed discussion of AOM is given by Daum  2002  and at  www.aomodeling.org.  3.2.3 A Document-Centered Step-by-Step Approach  In this section we describe a step-by-step approach, starting with an infor- mal  description,  then  constructing  a  model  using  the  AOM  approach, and  ﬁnally  transforming  the  AOM  model  into  an  XML  schema.  The results are XML data structures that closely represent the model.   114  Chapter 3 Structure  Customer CustomerID CustomerID Name    FirstName,   LastName  PhoneNo*  Position  Amount  Order  OrderNo OrderNo  +  Department DepartmentNo DepartmentNo Name  Receiver  Forwarder  forwards  Message  Receiver  Message  receives  RefNo RefNo  RefNo  RefNo  Product ProductNo ProductNo Name Price Currency,   Amount +  Service ProductNo ProductNo Name Duration Price Currency,   Amount +  Figure 3.14 A cluster comprised of the Product and Service assets. We have attributed the arcs emanating from forwards and receives to role names.  Informal description  Step 1 A popular method is to start with an informal verbal description of the scenario:    Customer A orders Products or Services.   Department B receives these Orders.   Department B forwards an Order to Department C or D.   An Order has Positions.   Each Position has an amount and a Product or a Service.  A  short  grammatical  analysis  separates  these  sentences  into  nouns  Customer,  Product,  Service,  Department,  Order   and  verbs   order,  re-   3.2 Conceptual Modeling  115  Assets and arcs  Normalization  ceive . In traditional ERM all nouns would be modeled as entities, and all verbs would be modeled as relationships. However, there is an ambiguity: the verb “orders” and the noun “Order” relate to the same concept.  Step 2 We avoid this problem by modeling both verbs and nouns as assets. We determine which properties each asset has and which property combina- tion can act as a minimal key. We identify as asset types Customer, Prod- uct, Service, Department, Order, forwards, receives.  The verb “has” is not modeled as an asset. Instead, “has amount” re- sults in a property of asset Position, and “has Product or Service” results in a cluster  for the “or”  with arcs leading to Product and Service.  As we identify the asset types we also represent the relations between the asset types by connecting them with arcs. Because an Order can have more than one Position asset, we represent this cardinality constraint by attributing this arc to the character “+”.  Department appears in two roles: as a forwarder and as a receiver. To dif- ferentiate between both, we label the arc emanating from “receives” with the respective role names. Optionally, we identify other roles with an ap- propriate role label.  Step 3 In this step, we make sure of the following:   Asset  types  are  primitive—their  properties  do  not  contain  assets  that could be modeled as independent asset types. This is similar to the ﬁrst normal  form   1NF   in  relational  theory.  For  example,  the  asset  type Order must not embed customer data.    Asset  types  are  minimal—they  do  not  contain  redundant  properties, meaning none of their properties can be derived from other properties.   Asset  types  should  have  a  key.  Keys  must  be  minimal—they  must consist of the smallest set of properties that can uniquely identify an instance.    Asset types must be complete—other assets contained in the scenario  can be derived from the deﬁned asset types.    Asset types must not be redundant—none of the deﬁned asset types can  be derived from other asset types.    All asset types must have a unique meaning.  Step 4 An asset type is in partitioned normal form  PNF  if the atomic properties of an asset constitute a key of the asset and all nonatomic properties are in partitioned normal form themselves.  Partitioned normal form   116  Chapter 3 Structure  The advantage of PNF assets is that their structure can be transformed without information loss. PNF is especially essential if we plan to store as- sets in relational databases. Relational technology requires fragmenting complex  structures  into  ﬂat  relational  tables.  Keys  that  span  complex structures are lost during such a transformation to ﬁrst normal form.  In  our  example,  all  asset  types  are  in  PNF.  Customer,  for  example, has the atomic property CustomerID as key. The nonatomic property Name  FirstName, LastName  is in PNF because the combination of the atomic subproperties FirstName and LastName constitutes a key.  In some cases, however, PNF is too strict. If we were to drop CustomerID from Customer, we would need to use Name FirstName,LastName  as key. Consequently, Customer would not be in PNF.  Step 5 Business  objects  are  assets  that  play  a  role  in  a  business  process.  This requires that we have a rough idea about the business process model  see Chapter 5 . In our example, Customer, Product, Service, and Department are business objects  Figure 3.15 . Business objects can consist of several assets. Formally we can cast any hierarchy  if we interpret the arcs as a relation between superior and inferior  of asset types into a business object. The top-level asset serves as the identifying asset of the business object.  We demarcate each business object with a rectangle and use a bold out-  line for the identifying asset.  Step 6 In this step we identify business documents. Usually, business documents are exchanged between the business objects engaged in a business pro- cess. In our example, we have only one business document, consisting of Order and Position.  Formally we can cast any hierarchy of asset types into a business docu- ment. The top-level asset serves as the identifying asset of the business object. In our case this is the asset Order.  We demarcate each business document with a dashed rectangle and  use a bold outline for the identifying asset.  Step 7 Usually not all asset types make their way into a business document. In our example, the asset types “receives” and “forwards” are left over.  Asset types that are neither part of business objects nor part of business documents can serve various purposes. In our case “receives” and “for-  Business objects  Business documents  Other assets   3.2 Conceptual Modeling  117  Customer  Customer CustomerID CustomerID Name    FirstName,   LastName  PhoneNo*  Product  Product ProductNo ProductNo Name Price Currency,   Amount +  Service  Service ProductNo ProductNo Name Duration Price Currency,   Amount +  Department  Order  Department DepartmentNo DepartmentNo Name  Position  Amount  Order  OrderNo OrderNo  +  Forwarder  Receiver  forwards  RefNo  RefNo  Receiver  Message  receives  Message  RefNo RefNo  Figure 3.15 Identifying business objects and business documents.  wards” serve as audit trails for the documents received and forwarded. We would, of course, implement those assets as XML schemata, too.  Other  assets  that  describe  the  relationships  between  business  docu- ments may result in the deﬁnition of business rules. Also in this case we would opt for an XML implementation, instead of “hard-coding” these rules into the application. The result is ease of maintenance and much higher responsiveness to change requests.   118  Chapter 3 Structure  XML schemata  Customer  Name  FirstName type  xsd:string  LastName type  xsd:string  CustomerID type  xsd:string  Y  PhoneNo type  F L  xsd:string 0...∞  M  A  E  Figure 3.16 Schema diagram for Customer.  T  Step 8 We can now deﬁne the XML schemata. At this point we have to decide how to implement is-a roles. There are two options: include the proper- ties of the target asset in the current asset, or use XML Schema’s inheri- tance  mechanisms,  such  as  global  complex  types.  The  latter  option  is only applicable as long as we deal with single inheritance. Multiple inher- itance is not possible with XML Schema.

This has several drawbacks:  Segmentation    Parsing  a  large  document  takes  a  long  time.  This  affects  almost  any processing of XML documents  for example, transformation with an XSLT style sheet  because most processing involves parsing.   130  Chapter 3 Structure  Overall layout    Processing  a  large  document  with  a  DOM  parser  requires  a  large amount  of  resources.  The  whole  document  is  converted  into  object form  each document node becomes a separate object , and this whole set of objects is kept resident in memory.    Collaborative  authoring  of  large  documents  is  awkward.  Some  data- base systems  and also standards like WebDAV  support locking only on the document level. So when one author changes a document, the document is locked for others.  Therefore  it  is  necessary  to  split  large  documents  into  smaller  ones. This is possible on the conceptional level, for example, by splitting a large business object into a main object and aggregate parts. Each part would be modeled as a unary relationship type to which the main object relates.  Step 10 With XML Schema we can deﬁne the schemata for each business object and business document.  However, we still need a way to describe the overall layout of the com- plete  model.  One  way  to  do  this  is  to  embed  annotations  into  the schemata, similar to the ones we used in a previous example:        refers to Order via OrderNo        However, this is an informal way and is hardly suitable to support auto- mated systems. Also, by including the model structure in the schemata, the  document  base  becomes  hard  to  maintain.  Changes  in  the  model would require changes in many schemata.  It  is  much  better  to  describe  the  model  separately  from  individual schemata. One possible way is by using RDF, which we will discuss in de- tail in Section 3.3.  Another possibility is to describe the complete model using the AOM serialization syntax, which is XML based  see www.aomodeling.org . Here is a  short  excerpt  showing  the  description  of  the  assets  Order, Position, Product, and Service:      Order  <asset id=”uuid:0016B448-EB27-47E3-AC09-9655CEF46A40”   name=”Order”>   3.2 Conceptual Modeling  131  <primaryKey  ﬁelds=”uuid:0016B448-EB27-47E3-AC09-9655CEF46A41” >  <property id=”uuid:0016B448-EB27-47E3-AC09-9655CEF46A41”  name=”OrderNo” >     <arc maxOccurs=”unbounded”   target=”uuid:0016B448-EB27-47E3-AC09-9655CEF46A50” >    <asset id=”uuid:0016B448-EB27-47E3-AC09-9655CEF46A50”   name=”Position”>                        Product  <asset id=”uuid:0016B448-EB27-47E3-AC09-9655CEF46A60”  name=”Product”>  <primaryKey  ﬁelds=”uuid:0016B448-EB27-47E3-AC09-9655CEF46A61” >  <property id=”uuid:0016B448-EB27-47E3-AC09-9655CEF46A61”  name=”ProductNo” >                              Service  <asset id=”uuid:0016B448-EB27-47E3-AC09-9655CEF46A70”   name=”Service”>  <primaryKey  ﬁelds=”uuid:0016B448-EB27-47E3-AC09-9655CEF46A71” >   132  Chapter 3 Structure  <property id=”uuid:0016B448-EB27-47E3-AC09-9655CEF46A71”  name=”ProductNo” >                                Note  that  the  level2 elements  enclose  business  objects.  UUIDs  are  used to establish ID IDREF structures between AOM items.  3.2.4 Smash the Enterprise Data Model? The enterprise data model postulates that the data of an enterprise should be described by one coherent, complete, and consistent data model.  The  idea  of  the  enterprise  data  model  has  its  roots  in  the  classical transactional systems. When the data of an enterprise is kept in a single database, it is relatively easy to watch over constraints—for example, en- sure that referenced entities are not deleted or that identiﬁers are kept unique.  The  same  still  holds  for  distributed  databases  that  employ  so- phisticated transaction protocols  like the two-phase commit  to main- tain the integrity of all connected databases.  However, data kept in the central repository is only a part of an enter- prise’s data set. A large amount of information accessible over the enter- prise’s  intranet  is  kept  scattered  across  multiple  independent  databases and ﬁle systems, even on the notebook computers and PDAs of the com- pany’s employees. And often the consistency and integrity of that data are in rather sad condition.  In addition, the existence of a global enterprise data model can be a drag  factor  for  the  IT  infrastructure  of  an  enterprise.  Many  enterprises today  have  a  ﬂat  organization,  with  business  units  acting  virtually autonomously, networking with other business units as they do with ex- ternal partners. The enterprise data model, however, reﬂects a more hier- archical company structure. Business units that want to introduce new business policies have to apply to a central unit for a change of the data model. And vice versa—a change in the global model requires notifying every business unit about the change.  Possible drag factor   3.2 Conceptual Modeling  133  Flat hierarchies  Chen, Thalheim, and Wong  1999  argue against bottom-up techniques  and postulate a solid modeling concept with a top-down approach:  It is very important to have a clean conceptual model of major components and  services  to  guide  us  in  this  integration  process.  It  should  work  like  a multi-level “map,” starting from a high-level map, which can be expanded into low-level maps in a hierarchical way. Each new software module con- structed should follow this conceptual “guidance” model  map  and provide a self-description on details of the components and interfaces speciﬁed by the conceptual guidance map.  But, when bottom-up and quick-and-dirty methods ﬂourish and top- down  engineering  techniques  are  avoided,  there  may  be  a  reason.  The reason could be that these top-down methods are not ﬂexible enough to catch up with an ever faster changing work environment: “. . . in the ﬂat organizations of today this kind of top-down strategies may not be suit- able, as groups and local units need to control and deﬁne information re- sources according to their practices”  Forsberg and Dannstedt 1999 .  The mess in today’s intranets is just an indication that the hierarchical enterprise data model increasingly fails to deliver. Too slow to follow the rapid  changes  of  the  business  environment  of  today,  this  model  made people turn to the more ﬂexible ad hoc solutions of Web technology.  This  does  not  mean  that  conceptual  modeling  is  wrong.  It  simply means that conceptual modeling techniques and Web technologies have to converge. Earlier in this chapter we have shown that the way from a conceptual model to the deﬁnition of business documents and business rules is relatively straightforward. We feel that this approach is a step in the right direction. Business objects, business documents, and business rules are the constituents of business processes. Doing business on the Web  implies  negotiating  how  the  business  processes  of  the  parties  in- volved in a transaction can collaborate. We will discuss in later chapters how to model such processes.  Also required is the development of Web technologies that can make a conceptual  model  go  live—the  conceptual  model  can  be  easily  trans- formed into a navigational structure. An example of such a transforma- tion is given in the discussion of WebML in Section 7.1.2.  3.2.5 Best Practices We recommend the following practices:    Identify business objects and business documents. In the case of a pur- chase order, for example, the order is a business document, while order lines are subordinate assets. Model business objects and business docu- ments as separate documents.   134  Chapter 3 Structure    Real-world entities are a good guide for detecting business objects. A customer, for example, is such an entity. The address of a customer, in contrast, is not such an entity but only a property of the customer en- tity. A customer address would therefore be modeled as a subordinate entity and as an element within an XML customer document.    Using such an approach will result in an intuitive model. However, in many  cases  it  is  difﬁcult  to  decide  on  what  should  be  modeled  as  a business object. What is a dominant entity and what is not can depend on the context. When we said earlier that a customer address should be  modeled  as  a  property,  we  were  referring  to  the  average  business case. However, in the context of a direct mailing service or the telecom industry, a street address is an asset and a business object.    Whenever possible, use the partitioned normal form for all business objects and business documents. As we just pointed out, models can depend on the context. In electronic business, where trade relation- ships are hard to predict, sometimes partners will have different ideas about which entity is a business object and which is not. It is therefore essential that business objects and business documents can be struc- turally transformed without information loss. The partitioned normal form guarantees exactly that.    Good starting points for identifying business objects are the electronic business standards such as Rosetta, BizTalk, and ebXML. These stan- dards deﬁne core business objects. The deﬁnitions of these business ob- jects are made available through public repositories. Using these deﬁ- nitions will increase the chance that potential business partners will “speak the same language.” If you cannot ﬁnd a particular business ob- ject in such a repository, you can contribute your own deﬁnitions to the repository, thus making them available to others. Remember that electronic business is not only about the collaboration of business pro- cesses but also about the collaboration of developers.  3.3 THE RESOURCE DESCRIPTION FRAMEWORK  AND CONCEPTUAL MODELING  In  this  section  we  will  introduce  the  Resource  Description  Framework  RDF . RDF can be seen as an enabling technology for semantic modeling, as a generic “assembler language” on top of which domain and task spe- ciﬁc languages can be built. RDF applications include the Dublin Core and also DAML and OIL—languages for the description of ontologies that we will discuss in Section 4.2.2.   3.3 The Resource Description Framework and Conceptual Modeling  135  In this section we show how RDF can be used to describe the concep-  tual models developed in the previous chapter.  RDF  has  been  a  W3C  recommendation  since  February  1999   RDF 1999 . The accompanying Resource Description Framework Schema Spe- ciﬁcation is, at the time of writing, a candidate recommendation  RDF 2000 .  RDF provides an open standard for describing Web resources—but not just Web resources. In fact, RDF allows statements to be made about any- thing, even about off line resources and the weather. As long as you can identify a resource with a URI  Universal Resource Identiﬁer , you can use RDF to say something about this resource. And because you can assign a unique URI to almost anything, including your children, your dog, and your Nintendo, RDF has a wide application range.  3.3.1 RDF Basics  We said that RDF allows you to make statements about resources. This is exactly the core point of RDF. RDF does not require modifying existing resources. An RDF description of a resource is a separate entity, and, as you have probably guessed, as a separate entity it can become a resource, too.  So,  you  can  make  statements  about  statements  about  statements, and so on. An ideal base for gossip. And, yes, no RDF description has the exclusive rights to describe a resource. There can be many RDF statements distributed over the Web that describe the same resource.  Now, what sort of statements can you make about a resource? RDF statements have a very simple structure. Each statement has the form of a triple, consisting of predicate, subject, and object. For example, in the  sentence  “John  has  phone  number  415-555-6789”,  the  subject  is “John”  because  we  are  talking  about  him,  “has  phone  number”  is  the predicate, and the object is the actual phone number, “415-555-6789”.  We can see this statement from a different viewpoint. We could say that the phone number is a property of John. This property is called  has the name  “phone number”, and the value of the property is “415-555- 6789”. In RDF, all statements have this form: Subject has property. Each property consists of a name value pair, with property values being string literals or references to other resources.  By now you are probably asking yourself, “Isn’t that similar to entity relationship  diagrams  where  entities  have  attributes?”  You  are  right, and that’s why we called this section “The Resource Description Frame- work and Conceptual Modeling.” RDF is one way to describe conceptual models.  The ﬁrst RDF statement   136  Chapter 3 Structure  RDF and ERM  Until now we haven’t talked about relationships. In fact, RDF does not know relationships as a separate concept. In RDF relationships are noth- ing  other  than  properties.  The  relationship  “John  is  married  to  Mary” would be expressed as “John has marriage with Mary”. “marriage with Mary” becomes a property of John. “marriage with” is the name of the property, and “Mary” is the value. Note that this statement does not tell us anything about Mary! It is a statement about John. To make this rela- tionship  bidirectional  we  would  have  to  issue  an  additional  statement “Mary has marriage with John”.  These are more or less the basics of RDF. Simple, easy to understand, and very powerful. Before we discuss some advanced features, let us sum- marize the basic concepts and present a few examples. Table 3.1 lists the different ingredients of a statement.  Note  that  literals  can  be  plain  strings  but  they  can  also  contain markup. For example, a literal could contain an XML structure. However, the RDF standard explicitly disavows a deﬁnition of equivalence between literals containing markup. This is because at the time the RDF standard was released, there existed no standard deﬁning the equivalence between two  XML  documents.  In  the  meantime,  the  XML  canonical  form  has been standardized  Boyer 2001 . This standard allows the comparison of two XML documents for equivalence by reducing the document layout to a canonical format. Future RDF versions may therefore contain a deﬁni- tion of equivalence for marked-up literals.  RDF is an abstract, conceptual framework for deﬁning and using meta- data, independent of any concrete implementation and syntax. However, to write RDF statements we require a concrete means of expression. One possibility  is  directed  labeled  graphs   also  called  “node  and  arc  dia- grams” .  See Figure 3.23.   Table 3.1 Anatomy of an RDF Statement.  Statement  Property  Domain  Example  Subject Predicate  Object  Property name Property value  Resource  Resource or literal  http:  www.ourfamily.org John PhoneNo  “415-555-6789”  Nodes and arcs   3.3 The Resource Description Framework and Conceptual Modeling  137  "415-555-6789"  www.ourfamily.org John  PhoneNo  Figure 3.23 Simple node and arc diagram. The resource  ellipsoid  has one literal property value  rectangle .  In  directed  labeled  graphs   DLGs   resources  are  shown  as  ellipsoids. Property values that are literals  strings  are shown as rectangles. An arc points from the subject to the object and is labeled with the predicate  property name . In an entity relationship diagram such a property would be represented as an attribute.  Another way to represent an RDF statement is the actual RDF syntax as deﬁned  in  the  RDF  speciﬁcation.   Currently,  the  RDF  syntax  is  going through a revision cycle; see Beckett 2001.  This syntax is based on XML. Each RDF description is represented as an XML element. However, this does not mean that such a description can only describe XML resources:  Syntax           415-555-6789           As you can see, all tags deﬁned by the RDF recommendation are preﬁxed with the identiﬁer rdf:, which has been assigned somewhere to the RDF namespace  URI.  The  about attribute  identiﬁes  the  subject  of  the  state- ment.  The  property  of  the  subject  is  deﬁned  as  a  child  element  of  the rdf:Description element. The tag denotes the property name, while the property value is expressed as element content. The preﬁx p: denotes a problem domain namespace, which, for example, we could have deﬁned using an XML namespace declaration such as  xmlns:p=”http:  www.telecom.com schema ”   138  Chapter 3 Structure  RDF vs. OO  Relationships  If you’ve been well educated in object-oriented  OO  thinking, by now you probably feel a bit dizzy. If you think of resources in terms of object orientation, everything in RDF seems to be turned upside down. Where is data encapsulation? Where is information hiding? In OO, the properties of objects are private by default, unless they are published via the object’s interface. In RDF, in contrast, you talk about existing resources—possibly resources at a foreign site. In most cases you would not even be able to modify a resource when you want to add a new property. RDF allows you to attach a new property from the outside.  Now let’s see how to present a relationship between two resources  see Table 3.2 and Figure 3.24 . In Figure 3.24 the property value  object  is shown as an ellipsoid, too, because the value is another resource  identi- ﬁed by a URI . RDF allows the deﬁnition of several properties that associ- ate two resources. This means that in terms of ERM an RDF property is equivalent to a named role within an unnamed relationship. RDF does not  offer  speciﬁc  constructs  to  deﬁne  named  relationships.   Of  course,  F L  Y  Table 3.2 Relationship between Two Resources.  Statement  Property  Domain  Example  E  T  Property name Property value  Subject Predicate  Object  Resource  Resource or literal  http:  www.ourfamily.org John Marriage_with  http:  www.ourfamily.org Mary  M  A  www.ourfamily.org Mary  www.ourfamily.org John  Marriage_with  Figure 3.24 Here the property value is another resource.  Team-Fly®   3.3 The Resource Description Framework and Conceptual Modeling  139  you could name a relationship by making a statement about a statement, which we will discuss shortly.            http:  www.ourfamily.org Mary           Note that we have used another problem domain namespace here. The preﬁx f: may be deﬁned as  Namespaces  xmlns:f=”http:  www.ourfamily.org schema ”  Authors of RDF descriptions are well advised to make extensive use of the namespace facilities available with XML. This avoids later conﬂicts when RDF descriptions are merged, which could be required, for exam- ple, in the case of company mergers or other marriages. Our two exam- ples can easily be merged into one single description:           415-555-6789     <f:Marriage_with        rdf:resource=”http:  www.ourfamily.org Mary” >  3.3.2 From ERM to RDF  Figure 3.25 shows how a previous ERM example is transformed into RDF. This example required the description of two resources, one for a Cus- tomer instance,  and  another  for  a  Product instance.  The  relationship between Customer and Product is modeled through a property of the Cus- tomer instance.  Note that in RDF we are talking about instances, while an entity rela- tionship diagram is about types of entities and relationships. We will see   140  Chapter 3 Structure  CustomerID  Price  Customer  orders  Product  Name  Phone  Name  Number   a    b   "W99-783"  ID  "Some Toys"  Name  "900-757"  ProductNo  "Ted"  Name  "510-555-4545"  PhoneNo  "49.95"  Price  www.some-toys.com  www.bears.com teddy757  orders  Figure 3.25 ERM converted to RDF:  a  entity relationship diagram;  b  directed labeled graph.   3.3 The Resource Description Framework and Conceptual Modeling  141  later how the Resource Deﬁnitions Schema Speciﬁcation allows us to talk about resource types.  The following code shows the RDF serialization of the example in Fig-  ure 3.25.

We had ignored that when translating the diagram into RDF. How do we describe such a relationship in RDF?  Two RDF constructs deal with multiple occurrences: Bag and Seq  se- quence .  A  Bag contains  unordered  property  values;  a  Seq contains  or- dered property values. Both containers are allowed to contain duplicate values—there is no concept of uniqueness in RDF. Figure 3.26 shows our example with bags.  Technically  a  bag  or  a  sequence  is  an  anonymous  intermediate  re- source of type rdf:Bag or rdf:Seq.  Note that the type is speciﬁed as just another  property.   The  RDF  syntax  speciﬁcation,  however,  provides  a shorthand  notation  in  the  form  of  tags:    and  .  The elements of a bag or a sequence are identiﬁed by an   tag:       W99-783     Some Toys     510-555-4545              Bags and sequences   142  Chapter 3 Structure  "900-757"  ProductNo  "W99-783"  ID  "Some Toys"  Name  www.some-toys.com  "510-555-4545"  PhoneNo  "Ted"  Name  "49.95"  Price  www.bears.com teddy757  rdf:li  more bears  rdf:li  rdf:li  rdf:li  orders  rdf:type  rdf:Bag  Figure 3.26 Using bags for teddies. Resource collections can be represented with Bag and Seq.               The syntax for the Seq container is similar.   3.3 The Resource Description Framework and Conceptual Modeling  143  Alternatives  An additional, third construct, called Alt  alternative , allows the spec- iﬁcation of a list of possible property values from which one is selected. The selection of one list element excludes the others from the relation- ship. In our example, using Alt instead of Bag could mean that the ﬁrst available  teddy  in  the  list  is  preferred  and  that  the  other  bears  quoted serve as alternatives when the ﬁrst bear isn’t available.  Earlier we stated that RDF can describe any resource. Now, when we deﬁne a Bag of resources, can we talk about this container and its con- tents? Of course we can.  First, we deﬁne the Bag as a resource in its own right:                 This Bag is  now  its  own  resource,  which  can  be  identiﬁed  via  the  URI “bag_of_bears”. So, we can make a statement about this resource:           Additionally, we can make statements about each member of the Bag.  To do so, RDF provides a special attribute aboutEach:           The aboutEachPreﬁx attribute can be used to make statements about the set of members in a container selected by a URI pattern—for example, about all resources in a Web site:     ™The Bears Company      3.3.3 Advanced Modeling Techniques  In this section, we show how constructs known from entity relationship modeling can be expressed in RDF.   144  Chapter 3 Structure  N-ary Relationships We have to give some consideration to n-ary relationships. ERM allows ternary, quaternary, and so on relationships, where one relationship asso- ciates three, four, or more entities with each other. RDF statements, how- ever, can model only binary relationships: subject to object. Aware of this problem, the RDF speciﬁcation recommends a way around it. Let’s con- sider the following cases:    Lecturer Miles recommends book XML Bible for course 3A.   Lecturer Miles recommends book OO Design for course 2B.   Lecturer Davis recommends book SGML Praxis for course 3A.  On the level of entity sets we could hardly split this ternary relation- ship into two binary relationships. We would lose information. The trick RDF uses is to introduce intermediate resources on the instance level:  <RDF  xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999 02 22-rdf-syntax-ns” xmlns:rdf=”http:  www.w3.org 1999 02 22-rdf-syntax-ns” xmlns:col=”http:  www.college.edu schema”>         <col:recommended_reading rdf:resource=  “http:  wwww.college.edu library XML_Bible” >  <col:course rdf:resource=  “http:  wwww.college.edu courses 3A” >        <col:recommended_reading rdf:resource=  “http:  wwww.college.edu library OO_Design >  <col:course rdf:resource=  “http:  wwww.college.edu courses 2B” >               <col:recommended_reading rdf:resource=  “http:  wwww.college.edu library SGML_Praxis” >  <col:course rdf:resource=   3.3 The Resource Description Framework and Conceptual Modeling  145  “http:  wwww.college.edu courses 3A” >           The col:Recommendation elements  deﬁned  within  the  Description ele- ments act as intermediate resources. Intermediate resources do not exist as real resources. They are of a purely ﬁctive nature and are only visible within the scope of the containing element.  At  this  point  we  have  to  explain  the  rdf:parseType attribute.  The parseType attribute  changes  the  interpretation  of  the  element  content. Two values are possible: Literal or Resource.    The value Literal speciﬁes that the element content must not be in- terpreted by an RDF processor. For example, when an element contains some  other  XML  or  HTML  markup,  this  value  should  be  speciﬁed.  Note: RDF explicitly disavows deﬁnition of equivalence between liter- als containing markup!     The value Resource speciﬁes that the element content must be treated  as if it were the content of a Description element.  Literals and resources  This  technique  of  modeling  n-ary  relationships  can  also  be  used  to model  attributed  relationships   see  Figure  3.27 .  A  binary  relationship with one attribute, for example, is modeled in the same way as a ternary relationship without an attribute:  Attributed relationships       W99-783     Some Toys     510-555-4545           9993-333                          146  Chapter 3 Structure  CustomerID  OrderNumber  Price  Customer  orders  Product  Name  Phone  Name  Number   a    b   "W99-783"  ID  "900-757"  ProductNo  "Some Toys" Name  www.some-toys.com  "510-555-4545"  PhoneNo  "Ted"  Name  "49.95"  Price  www.bears.com teddy757  orders  rdf:li  sales:orderlines  rdf:type  sales:OrderNumber  rdf:type  sales:Order  "9993-333"  rdf:Bag  Figure 3.27 Modeling relationships with attributes:  a  entity relationship diagram;  b  directed labeled graph.  more bears  rdf:li  rdf:li  rdf:li   3.3 The Resource Description Framework and Conceptual Modeling  147  This substitution is, as we can see, very similar to what is done in ERM dialects that do not know attributed relationships when we have to model attributed relationships: the relationship is modeled as an entity; that is, it is reiﬁed. In RDF, the distinction between relationships and entities blurs because each relationship can become a resource in its own right.  Aggregations The possibility of deﬁning resources “on the ﬂy” can be used to model ag- gregations, too  see Figure 3.28 :       45 3           <sales:Order rdf:ID=”order9993-333”  rdf:parseType=”Resource”>    9993-333   <sales:Customer  rdf:resource=”http:  www.some-toys.com” rdf:parseType=”Resource”>    W99-783     Some Toys     510-555-4545        <rdf:li  <rdf:li  <rdf:li  <rdf:li  rdf:resource=”http:  www.bears.com teddy757” >  rdf:resource=”http:  www.bears.com teddy766” >  rdf:resource=”http:  www.bears.com teddy565” >  rdf:resource=”http:  www.bears.com teddy123” >                        148  Chapter 3 Structure  OrderNumber  Order  CustomerID  Customer  orders  Product  Name  Phone  Name  Number  Price  Y  F L  E  T  M  A  receives  DepNo  Department   a   Figure 3.28 Modeling aggregation with RDF:  a  entity relationship diagram  ﬁgure continued on facing page .

To make statements about resource classes  or resource types  on the schema level, we need to investigate the possibilities deﬁned in the Resource Deﬁnition Schema Speciﬁcation.  But  before  we  do  this,  let’s  explain  quickly  how  we  can  make  state- ments about statements. Because the subject of a statement has to be a re- source, we have to cast the statement about which we want to make a statement into a resource—a process that is also called reiﬁcation. “Reiﬁca- tion” comes from Latin and means “to make into a thing.” By reifying a statement into a resource, we make it into a thing that we can talk about. Consider the following statement: “Mary has phone number 415-555-  4321.” We can easily model this statement in RDF:       415-555-4321             Now consider: “John says, ‘Mary has phone number 415-555-4321.’” Here  the  statement  “Mary  has  phone  number  415-555-4321”  becomes the subject X in the statement “X is attributed to John.”  There are several ways to model a statement as a resource, but the easi-  est is to equip the Description element with a bagID attribute:  <rdf:Description bagID=”AboutMary”  about=”http:  www.ourfamily.org Mary”>    415-555-4321       Every statement within the Description element is reiﬁed and becomes a resource within a Description bag. We can now make statements about these resources:       John        3.3 The Resource Description Framework and Conceptual Modeling  151  Gödel, Church, and RDF  Implications for RDF  Warning: If we consider an RDF statement as a “thought,” then reiﬁca- tion opens the opportunity to “think” about “thoughts.” So be very care- ful which sort of RDF statements you place on the Web—maybe it’s you who caused the Web to become self-conscious!  In terms of formal logic, a set of basic RDF statements constitutes a ﬁrst-order logic system. With reiﬁcation  i.e., making statements about statements  we get a second-order logic system, and second-order systems have their problems. In 1931, Kurt Gödel showed that second-order sys- tems are logically incomplete, in contrast to ﬁrst-order systems, for which he  had  previously   in  1930   proved  completeness.  The  basic  idea  of Gödel’s proof of incompleteness is to construct a statement that makes a statement about itself: it claims that itself cannot be proved.  But  avoiding  reiﬁcation  wouldn’t  help  us  much  further.  In  1936 A. Church proved that even for the ﬁrst-order predicate logic there is no general method to decide on the correctness or incorrectness of a state- ment within a ﬁnite time span using a mechanical device such as a Tu- ring machine. And since our fastest computers cannot do better than a Turing machine, we have a problem, even if we don’t use reiﬁcation.  However, for RDF the practical implications remain minor. Although in the design of computer languages decidability plays a crucial role  for example, Backus-Naur grammars are always decidable  because we want a parser to stop with a result after a ﬁnite time span, this is not a critical element in an open system such as the Internet. Almost always the com- plete set of RDF statements on the Web will be incomplete and even con- tradictory. A search engine that operates on such a set of RDF statements will therefore be constructed in such a way that it will successfully answer queries  in  most  cases.  In  some  cases,  however,  such  a  search  engine would have to stop reasoning after a given time span and report its failure to ﬁnd a result.  Second-order logic can be very helpful in representing the results of a query. With ﬁrst-order logic, the query “Who won the U.S. election in 2000?” would simply return “George Bush or Al Gore”. We wouldn’t have needed a billion-dollar computer network for that sort of answer. With second-order  logic,  however,  the  answer  could  be  something  like  this: “The  Republican  Web  site  claims  George  Bush  as  the  winner,  and  the Democratic Web site claims Al Gore as the winner.” Although we already knew this from TV, it gives us a much clearer picture of what is going on. To  make  the  result  of  a  query  traceable we  require  the  ability  to  make statements about statements.   152  Chapter 3 Structure  Taxonomy of resources  Semantic constraints  3.3.5 RDF Schema In the previous subsections we showed how to use RDF to describe re- sources on the Web and elsewhere. All this happened on the level of indi- vidual resources or collections of individual resources, that is, always on the instance level.  The RDF Schema Speciﬁcation  RDFS  enables us to deﬁne a taxonomy of resources in terms of resource classes, superclasses, and subclasses. For each  of  these  classes  we  can  deﬁne  which  types  of  statements  may  be made about the instances of these classes, that is, which types of proper- ties can be associated.  This does not mean that we always have to deﬁne RDF schemata when we want to describe some resource. RDF can be used without accompany- ing RDF schemata—the use of RDFS is optional.  This is similar to XML. Well-formed XML documents can be processed without a DTD, but when a DTD is deﬁned, the documents that refer to the DTD as DOCTYPE can be checked for validity. In contrast with DTDs, RDF schemata do not just deﬁne the structure of an RDF statement but can also deﬁne semantic constraints. For example, it is possible to restrict the range and the value domain of given statement types.  In a previous subsection now and then we used the rdf:type property, for example, rdf:type=”rdf:Bag”. This property connects a resource in- stance to a resource type or resource class. In the case of rdf:Bag this was a predeﬁned RDF resource class. RDFS, in addition, allows us to declare our own user-deﬁned resource classes. In many ways, the RDFS type sys- tem  is  similar  to  the  class  hierarchies  in  object-oriented  programming. However,  there  is  a  major  difference:  in  object-oriented  programming you deﬁne a class by specifying features  attributes and methods  of the class. This is usually done in the context of the class deﬁnition.  RDFS works just the other way around: properties  statements  are the subject of speciﬁcation, and you describe to which resource classes they apply. This is done via the rdfs:domain and rdfs:range constraints. The rdfs:domain constraint describes to which resource classes a given prop- erty applies, while the rdfs:range constraint describes the allowed range for the property value.  In  the  following  example  we  show  how  to  model  a  generalization. Deﬁned are three classes, ProductOrService, Product, and Service, with Product and Service being subclasses of ProductOrService:  <rdf:RDF  xmlns:rdf=”http:  www.w3.org 1999 02 22-rdf-syntax-ns”  xmlns:rdfs=”http:  www.w3.org 2000 01 rdf-schema”>   3.3 The Resource Description Framework and Conceptual Modeling  153     Abstract superclass for products and services.               The class of products.            The class of services.           <rdfs:range rdf:resource=  “http:  www.examples.com classesCatNumbers” >                                  Note  that  the  rdfs:Class tag  starts  the  deﬁnition  of  a  resource  class. This tag is deﬁned in the RDFS speciﬁcation, hence the namespace preﬁx rdfs:. The ID attribute deﬁnes the class name. We deﬁne three classes: ProductOrService, Product, and Service, with Product and Service being subclasses of ProductOrService.  The elements rdf:Property deﬁne resources of type Property. The ID at- tribute deﬁnes the property name. Resource deﬁnitions are standard RDF   154  Chapter 3 Structure  operations, hence the namespace identiﬁer rdf:. We deﬁne two proper- ties: Number and Duration.  The element rdfs:range deﬁnes the value range for each property. In the case of the property Number, the range deﬁnition refers to a resource http:  www.examples.com classesCatNumbers. We assume that the data- type CatNumbers is deﬁned in this resource. For property Duration a new datatype is created on the spot: a class Duration is deﬁned, and several re- sources  of  type  Duration enumerate  the  possible  values.  Each  property can have only a single rdfs:range speciﬁcation.  The element rdfs:domain deﬁnes to which resource classes each prop- erty applies. We have speciﬁed class ProductOrService as the domain for property Number. Because the classes Product and Service are subclasses of ProductOrService,  the  property  applies  to Product and Service,  too.  In contrast, the property Duration applies only to class Service. Each prop- erty may have multiple rdfs:domain speciﬁcations.  rdfs:domain and rdfs:range belong  to  RDFS,  hence  the  namespace identiﬁer rdfs:. Because RDF and RDFS are separate speciﬁcations, they also use two different namespaces for their syntactical elements. That can be disturbing: schema authors must constantly switch between the two namespaces. Somehow, this reminds us of the tourist who drowned in Finland because all the lakes, islands, and peninsulas confused him and he ended up mistaking a lake for land.  As  we  have  seen,  subclasses  do  inherit  properties  from  their  parent classes  Product and Service inherited Number from ProductOrService . At the very top of the RDFS class hierarchy is the predeﬁned class rdfs:Re- source, which includes all RDF resources as instances. In RDFS, a subclass can inherit from several parent classes by using several rdfs:subClassOf clauses.  In  object-oriented  programming  this  is  called  multiple  inheri- tance. Multiple inheritance has quite a reputation in OO because inherit- ing from multiple parents can lead to name clashes between features with different  implementations.  In  RDFS,  however,  this  cannot  happen  be- cause property deﬁnitions are resources in their own right and are unique within their namespace.  What  is  possible  for  classes  is  also  possible  for  properties.  Properties  can be deﬁned as subproperties of  several  other properties:                Inheritance   3.3 The Resource Description Framework and Conceptual Modeling  155  Extension mechanism  What’s left? Currently, RDFS deﬁnes only a limited set of constraint properties: rdfs:domain and rdfs:range. To deﬁne additional constraints we  need  an  extension  mechanism.  This  is  provided  by  means  of  class rdfs:ConstraintProperty,  a  subclass  of  class  rdf:Property.  Both  rdfs: domain and rdfs:range are instances of rdfs:ConstraintProperty.  For example, it would be possible to deﬁne a new constraint property  myext:unique as a new instance of class rdfs:ConstraintProperty:     <rdfs:domain rdf:resource=  “http:  www.w3.org 1999 02 22-rdf-syntax-nsProperty” >  “http:  www.w3.org 2000 01 rdf-schemaClass” >  <rdfs:range rdf:resource=       <rdfs:range rdf:resource=  “http:  www.examples.com classesCatNumbers” >    <myext:unique rdf:resource=  “http:  www.examples.com classesUniqueNumbers” >     By using this extension mechanism it becomes possible to deﬁne all sorts of constraints. However, the RDFS speciﬁcation only deﬁnes the se- mantics of the constraints rdfs:range and rdfs:domain.  This has a reason of course: A constraint such as unique could hardly be handled identically in all environments. While it is easy to guarantee the value of a property to be unique within the conﬁned space of a trans- actional database, the same constraint becomes impossible to guarantee in an open environment such as the Internet.  Wish List This leaves us with some wishes  which are also wishes for other schema deﬁnition systems . Earlier in this book, in Chapter 1, we postulated that future  software  systems  must  be  able  to  distinguish  between  the  “re- quired” and the “should.” What we would like to see is the introduction of the concept of soft constraints. In contrast to hard constraints, which know only one possible policy  strict enforcement in all environments , soft  constraints  would  know  a  variety  of  possible  policies  that  may depend on the context.  Soft constraints   156  Chapter 3 Structure  Let’s  look  at  an  example.  The  unique constraint  mentioned  earlier  could know the following policies:    Reject: Reject  a  transaction  when  a  property  violates  this  constraint. This type of policy could be used in transactional systems. Here it is relatively easy to check for uniqueness, and uniqueness is absolutely necessary for certain properties  for example keys .    Repair: Here an agent could travel the network and try to repair invalid properties asynchronously. This type of policy could be used within an intranet, where an agent of that kind would possess the necessary ac- cess rights for reading and modifying data.    Report: Here an agent could travel the network and report any invalid properties. This type of policy could be used within an extranet, where an  agent  of  that  kind  would  possess  the  necessary  access  rights  for reading data.    Ignore: Nothing is done here. The typical environment for this policy is the  Internet,  where  it  would  be  completely  senseless  to  enforce uniqueness of a certain property.  3.3.6 Reasoning with RDF  The XML syntax that we have used above for RDF statements is only one of  many  possible  representations.  The  statement  shown  in  Figure  3.23 could also be expressed in the form of a triple {predicate, subject, object}:   PhoneNo,www.ourfamily.org john,”415-555-6789”   In  this  form,  an  RDF  statement  can  be  easily  stored  in  a  relational database.  With a little bit more transformation we arrive at  PhoneNo www.ourfamily.org john,”415-555-6789”   a form that should be familiar to all readers who have some background in  logic  programming.  In  the  logic  programming  language  Prolog,  for example, such a construct is called a fact. A Prolog program consists of a collection of facts and rules  in general rules have the form “A holds if B and or C holds” . A query will start an inference engine that applies rules to  facts  in  order  to  return  a  result.  No  procedural  programming  is required.  The question that immediately springs to mind is, Why not add rules to RDF and use RDF for logic programming? This was exactly the goal of a W3C effort called METALOG.  METALOG   3.3 The Resource Description Framework and Conceptual Modeling  157  METALOG had two objectives: First it extended RDF with the possibil- ity of deﬁning logic rules. Second it provided an almost natural language interface to RDF. The RDF syntax that we have presented here is not very user friendly but rather is designed to store and process RDF in an XML environment. A user-friendly syntax could greatly improve the adoption of RDF on a wider scale. As stated by Marchiori and Saarela  2000 : “Meta- log allows users to write metadata, inference rules and queries in English- like syntax.”  The previous RDF statement could be expressed as follows:  “www.ourfamily.org john” has as “PhoneNo” “415-555-6789”.  If John has several phone numbers, we could write  “www.ourfamily.org john” has as “PhoneNo” “415-555-6789” and “212- 555-0001”.  The “and” keyword would be translated into an RDF Bag construct con- taining both phone numbers.  We can also use verbs as predicates:  “www.ourfamily.org mary” “lives_with” “www.ourfamily.org john”.  This would translate into  lives_with www.ourfamily.org mary,www.ourfamily.org john   To allow the deﬁnition of rules, Metalog adds the operators “implies”, “and”,  “or”,  and  variables  to  RDF.  Variables  are  denoted  with  the  ﬁrst character in upper case.  We  can  now  deﬁne  a  rule  that  reasons  about  the  two  facts  deﬁned  earlier:  if X “lives_with” Y and Y has as “PhoneNo” Z   then X has as “PhoneNo” Z.  Note that the keyword “and” has a different meaning here. It is used as a logical “and”, not as an indicator for an RDF Bag. Which “and” is which is decided by the context. Similarly, the keyword “or” can be used for a logical “or” or to denote an RDF Alt. The keyword “order” is used for an RDF Seq.  Finally we can query our little expert system with  what “PhoneNo” does “www.ourfamily.org mary” have?  which would result in a new statement:  “www.ourfamily.org mary” has as “PhoneNo” “415-555-6789” and “212-555-0001”.   158  Chapter 3 Structure  Y  F L  3.3.7 Best Practices  We recommend the following practices:    When writing RDF descriptions always use namespaces to identify the problem domain. This allows merging RDF descriptions at a later time without pain. The identiﬁcation of problem domains, the deﬁnition of namespaces, and the deﬁnition of a namespace vocabulary are closely related to the deﬁnition of an ontology  see Section 4.2 .    When  modeling  relationships  between  two  entities,  make  sure  not only to deﬁne the relationship as an RDF property of one entity but also to deﬁne the inverse relationship as a property of the target entity.  3.4 A U FOR AN X  M  A  E  T  In this section, we discuss UML-modeling techniques in the context of XML.  Due  to  an  “impedance  mismatch”  between  both  technologies, modeling XML-based systems with UML can be tricky.  3.4.1 XML Modeling with UML  The Uniﬁed Modeling Language  UML  is a framework for modeling com- plex information systems that has become an industry standard within the last decade. UML emerged as the successor of three previously leading object-oriented  modeling  methods   Booch,  OMT,  and  OOSE .  It  com- bines these three methods into one consistent modeling method. Addi- tionally,  it  addresses  problems,  such  as  process  modeling,  that  these methods previously did not fully address.  UML has been endorsed by the Object Management Group  OMG  as a standard modeling method. The OMG is an international organization promoting the theory and practice of object-oriented technology in soft- ware development. The OMG is also the organization behind Common Object Request Broker Architecture  CORBA , so it should not be a sur- prise that UML has strong links to CORBA.  UML  1.4  has  been  submitted  to  the  International  Organization  for Standardization  ISO  and will become an ISO standard. In addition, UML has been selected by UN CEFACT as the standard modeling method for ebXML.  UML comprises six different models:  1. The use case model, for requirement analysis  business model   Team-Fly®  Standardization   3.4 A U for an X  159  2. The class model, for modeling the static structures of information  objects  actions  3. The state model, for modeling the dynamic behavior of objects 4. The  activity  implementation  model,  which  describes  work  unit  5. The interaction model, which describes scenarios and message ﬂows 6. The  deployment  model,  which  describes  the  deployment  of  soft-  ware subsystems  UML and ERM In the context of this section we are interested only in the class model  item 2 in the previous list . The UML class model resembles more or less the classic entity relationship model. However, the nomenclature is dif- ferent  entities are called objects, entity sets are called classes, and rela- tionship sets are called associations . After all, UML is an object-oriented modeling  language.  Figure  3.29  shows  an  example  of  a  UML  class diagram.  Compared to the entities in ERM the main difference is that objects are dynamic—they display a behavior. Each object has attributes whose val- ues determine the state of the object. In addition, objects can have opera- tions  methods ,  which  can  inform  about  the  value  of  attributes  and which can change the value of attributes  i.e., change the object’s state . Objects  relate  to  each  other  by  sending  messages   calling  each  other’s methods  or by aggregation.  The  attributes  of  an  object  determine  the  type of  an  object.  Objects equipped with the same set of attributes have the same type. This can be compared with the entity set in ERM. Both methods and attributes of an object  determine  the  class of  an  object.  Objects  with  the  same  sets  of methods and attributes are instances of the same class. This means that in- stances of a class all expose the same behavior. ERM does not have an equivalent to the class construct because ERM does not model dynamic behavior. In UML, however, it is possible to model class hierarchies. Sub- classes can inherit features from abstract superclasses. Generalization is modeled via superclasses.  Associations can be constrained in UML at both ends by a multiplic- ity  cardinality  speciﬁcation. The most common speciﬁcations are 0 . . 1, 0 . . *, 1, 1 . . *  OneOptional, ManyOptional, OneMandatory, ManyMandatory . Associations  can  be  bidirectional  or  unidirectional   navigability .  For example, when an object sends a message to another object, the sender knows the receiver, but the receiver does not necessarily know the sender. Each end of an association may have a role name.

Attributes are listed below the class name. Associations can be named  in addition, role names are possible . The cardinality is denoted in explicit numbers  n:m , with an asterisk denoting an unbounded number of occurrences. Subclasses inherit attributes from superclasses.  Subclasses  Stereotypes  One outstanding feature of UML is the powerful extension mechanism offered with stereotypes. A stereotype is always based on existing UML constructs but introduces new semantics.  UML and AOM Asset-oriented models can be mapped onto UML, too. To do so we map every asset onto a UML class. The arcs between the assets become UML associations that are named with the respective role names. Compared to traditional UML modeling, this approach is very powerful. Because classi-   3.4 A U for an X  161  cal relationships are modeled as assets, too, and are thus mapped onto UML  classes,  we  do  not  have  problems  representing  relationships  be- tween relationships and n-ary relationships in UML.  However, UML requires the introduction of extra classes:    Complex properties must be resolved into classes, since UML classes  can possess only simple properties.    Clusters must be represented as generalized classes in UML. The cluster  members are represented as subclasses of these generalized classes.  UML and XML XML documents can be modeled in UML as aggregations of objects, basi- cally one UML class element per XML element plus some auxiliary ele- ments.  Conallen   2000 ,  Booch  et  al.   1999 ,  and  Heintz  and  Kimber  1999  describe how a DTD or XML Schema can be mapped onto UML  and vice versa, how UML can be used to design a DTD :    XML element types are modeled in UML as  > stereotype  elements.    XML  attributes  can  be  mapped  directly  to  UML  attributes.  XML  at- tributes are atomic values of a certain datatype. This requires the deﬁ- nition of appropriate datatypes in the UML model.    XML element content  such as character data  can be modeled as an  attribute with a  > stereotype.    XML elements of content type ANY are modeled with a <<DTDElement-    XML elements of content type EMPTY are modeled with a <<DTDElement-    The ownership between elements  parent-child  is indicated by direc-    Model  groups  are  represented  by  new  stereotyped  elements.  Since model groups are anonymous, dummy names must be introduced in the UML model. Sequence groups are represented by a <<DTDSequence- Group>> stereotype; choice groups, by a  > stereotype.   The order of sequences is captured as ordinal values in role constraints.   Multiplicity  of  elements  is  mapped  directly  into  the  corresponding  UML constraints  see Table 3.3 .    Mixed elements in XML  i.e., elements containing character data com- bined with child elements  can be mapped onto model groups  see ear- lier .  A  mixed  element  can  be  described  as  a  repeated  alternative  of content and child elements.  ANY>> stereotype.  EMPTY>> stereotype.  tional associations.   162  Chapter 3 Structure  Table 3.3 Cardinality Notations in XML and UML.  XML   no modiﬁer  ? + *  UML  1 0 . . 1 1 . . * 0 . . *  Using  this  technique,  it  becomes  possible  to  import  a  DTD   e.g.,  an industry  standard  DTD   into  UML,  do  a  few  modiﬁcations,  and  ex- port it again. The leading UML case tools support such import and export processes.  In  a  similar  fashion,  XML  Schema  deﬁnitions  can  be  mapped  onto  UML structures. This is described in detail by Carlson  2001 .  The advantages of this technique are that DTDs and schemata can be visualized  but good schema editors can do that, too  and that the docu- mentation is improved. It is also possible to generate program code from the UML model, such as Java code. We obtain wrapper code that is quite intuitive and allows easy access to the XML document structures.  From UML to XML Note,  however,  that  the  UML  model  obtained  with  this  method  is  an implementation  model  and  not  a  conceptual  model.  This  technique requires that the UML model follow the structures of the XML document. But how do we generate XML schemata from a preexisting conceptual UML model?  One  possibility  could  be  to  exploit  the  code  generation  facilities  of UML tools. Most UML case tools can generate program code, and some allow user-deﬁned production rules, allowing the generation of any code including XML schemata. However, this technique relies very much on the proprietary features of the respective tool.  A better option is to use the fact that most UML tools can export XMI code. XMI  see Section 3.4.2  was developed to exchange modeling data between  different  modeling  tools.  Thus,  XMI  contains  the  modeling data in a standardized format. And because XMI is an XML language, we can  transform  XMI  modeling  data  into  any  other  XML  format—in- cluding XML Schema—with the help of an XSLT style sheet  see Chapter 9 .  An  example  style  sheet  is  available  at  the  authors’  Web  site   www. xmlArchitecture.org .  Using XMI   3.4 A U for an X  163  So, to create XML schemata out of a UML model, we have to perform  three steps:  1. Export the model in XMI format. 2. Write an appropriate XSLT style sheet  or generate it with an appro-  3. Translate the XMI data with the help of the XSLT style sheet into  priate tool .  the target format.  UML and RDF XML schema creation is not the only interesting aspect when looking at the relationship between UML and XML. In Table 3.4 we compare the modeling capabilities of UML with those of RDF  Chang 1998 . Keep in mind that UML is an object-oriented technique, while ERM and RDF are not.  RDF  and  UML  are  fairly  equivalent  when  it  comes  to  modeling  the static aspects of an information set. RDF has some restrictions in the con- straint area: cardinality and optionality constraints are expressed via con- tainers  that  only  allow  expressing  1: 0,n   relationships.  This  is  rather weak compared to the rich set of constraint expressions that are available in UML. But keep in mind that RDF was designed for the World Wide Web, where mandatory associations are very hard to control; unresolved links are all too common on the Web.  The similarities between RDF and UML allow us to use UML as a design method for RDF resource descriptions. What is not possible, in general, is to map any UML model in terms of native RDF statements.  That does not mean that it is impossible to describe any UML model us- ing RDF statements. For example, Melnik  2000  takes the approach of deﬁning every identiﬁable UML element as an RDF resource. A set of RDF statements can thus describe any UML model. But note that these state- ments are statements about the UML model, and not about the real-world entities that are the subjects of the UML model—we are on a higher level of abstraction.  3.4.2 XMI: Exchange Format for Model Data  The XML Metadata Interchange  XMI  is the industry standard for encod- ing UML models into XML  XMI 1999 . Endorsed by OMG and supported by major industry partners such as IBM and Oracle, the XMI speciﬁcation can be considered as a part of the UML speciﬁcation.   164  Chapter 3 Structure  Table 3.4 Comparing UML with ERM and RDF.

MOF is the OMG’s adopted technology for deﬁning metadata and representing it as CORBA objects. Because UML is also based on MOF, XMI presents itself as an interchange format for UML.  This origin positions XMI for possible application domains. XMI is pre- dominantly used to exchange model data between different development tools, such as UML toolkits, development studios, and so on. The authors of the XMI speciﬁcation give the following motivation for the design of XMI  XMI 1999 :  The reality is that no single tool exists for both modeling the enterprise and documenting the applications that implement the business solution. A com- bination of tools from different vendors is necessary but difﬁcult to achieve because the tools often cannot easily interchange the information they use with each other. This leads to translation or manual re-entry of information, both of which are sources of loss and error.   When all of the development tools understand XMI, round-trip engi- neering across multivendor development platforms becomes a possibility. In addition, XMI makes it easy to exchange model data across distributed development  environments.  While  it  was  difﬁcult  or  impossible  to  ex- change model parts between heterogeneous UML tools in the past, XMI opens up that possibility, provided the participating tools know how to import XMI and merge the imported parts into an existing model. Fur- thermore, XMI allows the development of catalogues of design patterns in a vendor-neutral format.  Finally,  XMI  can  be  used  as  an  intermediate  step  when  generating  XML Schema deﬁnitions out of UML  see Section 3.4.1 .  As an example let’s look at the XMI serialization for the UML diagram in Figure 3.29. All deﬁnitions made in the model—classes, attributes, as- sociations,  cardinality—are  represented  as  independent  XML  elements and identiﬁed via the xmi.id attribute. These elements relate to each other by utilizing XML’s ID IDREF mechanism.

The in- tent of XMI is to exchange information between machines. But even for computers an XMI-serialized UML model can be a stress test: UML repos- itories of 200 MB or more are not uncommon, and the full serialization of such a model would result in XMI documents that easily break into the gigabyte class.

Even more important than syntax is agreeing about an  ontology—a system of meaning.  In  this  chapter  we  introduce  formal  semantics,  context,  and ontologies. If you plan to implement collaborative appli-  cations, this is required reading.  One way to specify semantic aspects formally is the deﬁni-  tion of constraints. In Section 4.1, we take a close look at con-  straints and how they can be deﬁned in schemata, especially  in XML Schema. Constraints are, however, only one aspect of  the deﬁnition of formal semantics. Ontologies provide addi-  tional means for the declaration of formal semantics. In Sec-  tion 4.2, we discuss the different levels of ontological depth  169   170  Chapter 4 Meaning  Semantic markup?  and introduce languages for the deﬁnition of ontologies such as DAML and OIL. In Section 4.3, we take an excursion into the Western philosophy of the past 2,000 years. We learn that context is important when interpreting the meaning of a message, especially in a globalized environment. This leads into Section 4.4, where we take a closer look at the formal treatment of context. In Section 4.4.2, we discuss a practical approach for implementing context- aware semantics with XML: the Schema Adjunct Framework.  4.1 FORMAL SEMANTICS  The Internet is about sharing information. This involves publishing the information,  navigating  to  the  relevant  information,  and  interpreting that information. HTML is hardly able to fulﬁll these requirements, and XML was designed to ﬁll this gap.  The markup of XML has been called by some a “semantic markup.” This  is  in  contrast  to  HTML,  where  most  of  the  markup  elements  are purely representational. In XML, as common belief has it, the markup de- notes the meaning of an element.  However, when we take a formal approach, we discover that the oppo- site is true. What conveys meaning to a human reader does not necessar- ily do the same to a machine. In XML, it is the tag name that allows hu- man readers to associate a meaning with an element, provided the tag name matches an entry in the internal dictionary of the reader’s brain. If the  tag  name  is  outside  the  scope  of  the  reader’s  expertise,  the  tag  is meaningless. Two readers with different backgrounds may even interpret the same tag as having two different meanings.  Consider the tag  . A reader with a political background may interpret  the  tag  as  a  motion  in  a  deliberative  assembly.  In  contrast,  a reader  with  a  medical  background  may  interpret  it  as  being  related  to sickness.  An XML parser does none of the above. It just reports that this is a tag and that the tag name is “motion.” That’s all. Parsers are about syntax, not about semantics.  With  the  purely  representational  HTML,  it  is  just  the  opposite.  The semantics of the tag   are clearly deﬁned in the HTML speciﬁcation and put into action by any Web browser. Elements enclosed between   and   are printed in bold. Tags in HTML have clearly deﬁned semantics—of course, only in the context of document representation and navigation.   4.1 Formal Semantics  171  Semantic free  The XML speciﬁcation does not deﬁne semantics for tags. Tags in XML are user deﬁned, so it is the responsibility of the user to associate a mean- ing with each tag. Most XML-based languages do so, but they do it in a rather informal way. For example, SVG and SMIL, both XML-based repre- sentation languages, deﬁne the meaning of each tag. The semantics of the tags are described in the SVG and SMIL speciﬁcations and are imple- mented in the SVG and SMIL browser plug-ins.  Unfortunately, there is no standard way to deﬁne semantics formally for an XML-based language. DTDs allow only the description of the vo- cabulary and the structure of a document. Also XML Schema does not go much further in this respect. This is hardly sufﬁcient to establish commu- nication in the global village  Doerr 1998 :  To summarise, we are on the brink of a technological revolution, which will render obsolete the need for homogeneous data formats for communication. Rather,  we  must  engage  in  providing  formal  deﬁnitions  of  the  underlying semantics in our data. Not the superﬁcial identity of structure, but the seman- tic compatibility is needed. This will enable far richer services to be created than standardisation could ever provide.  Let’s begin at the end. What is required for the correct interpretation of information is that both sender and receiver  or publisher and surfer  not only speak the same language, but also share the same conceptualization of the information. This includes a shared vocabulary, a shared set of con- straints, and a shared conceptual framework such as type hierarchies and other relationships between classes of information items:    The shared vocabulary guarantees that syntactical tokens  words  carry the  same  meaning  for  both  sender  and  receiver.  Such  vocabularies are developed  from  the  vocabulary  used  in  a  given  community  or industry.    A shared conceptual framework—if it is complete—guarantees that the understanding  of  the  information  is  not  inﬂuenced  by  unspeciﬁed background knowledge.  Let’s  now  see  what  is  required  to  specify  semantics  in  a  formal  and  machine-readable way.  4.1.1 Formal Semantics and Constraints  To understand how to formally deﬁne meaning we look at a few exam- ples. Here is one from school:  Understanding shared information   172  Chapter 4 Meaning  What is our understanding of a square? A square is a rectangle where width equals  height.  Similarly  we  can  deﬁne  a  rectangle  as  a  four-sided  polygon where all sides intersect at angles of 90 degrees.  From this simple deﬁnition we can already deduce two concepts:    Relation. To deﬁne “square,” we relate it to “rectangle.” To deﬁne “rec-  tangle,” we relate it to “polygon.”    Constraint. To distinguish between “rectangle” and “polygon,” we de- ﬁne constraints  four sides, 90-degree angles . To distinguish between “square”  and  “rectangle,”  we  deﬁne  additional  constraints   width equals height . As a matter of fact, relations can also be seen as con- straints. The fact that a square is a rectangle does certainly constrain the shape of a square.  Let’s apply these simple concepts to a more complex object:  What is our understanding of a car? A car is a vehicle. It has an engine and more than two wheels. A car is driven by a driver.  Here we see different relations at work: is_a, has, driven_by. There is also a constraint: “more than two.” Again, the relations “is a vehicle,” “has an engine,” and “driven by a driver” can also be seen as constraints.  In addition, we can list some background knowledge that helps us to understand the meaning of the notion “car” without deﬁning it in the strict sense:  Cars are used for transportation. Cars take part in road trafﬁc. Cars have acci- dents. Cars are produced by car manufacturers and are sold by car dealers. Cars add to the greenhouse effect. And so on.  The concept of a car is thus interrelated with other concepts and gains additional meaning by that. The most important sentence here is proba- bly the ﬁrst one: concepts are best described by their practical purpose or effect.  Remember  that  the  meaning  of  a  command  in  a  computer  lan- guage is determined by the effect the command has when the application is executed.  However,  humans  are  not  computers.  They  learn  the  meaning  of  a term in a different manner, usually in a complex process of abstraction and differentiation. When you think of “car,” the ﬁrst thing that proba- bly comes to mind is the mental image of a sedan. The sedan object acts as  a  prototype   Gardner  1985   for  the  category  “car”  and  is  probably what a child ﬁrst associates with “car.” Only later we learn that the con- cept “car” also contains other car types such as race cars, railroad cars,  Background knowledge  How humans learn   4.1 Formal Semantics  173  pickups, vans, cabriolets, and so on. We learn to differentiate between these by learning the differences from the prototype.  4.1.2 Constraints in Schema Deﬁnitions  In a generic language such as XML it is possible to standardize semantics only in the most fundamental way. DTDs, for example, support only the absolute minimum. They allow datatype deﬁnitions such as NAME, ID, and IDREF only for element attributes.  A datatype deﬁnition is a constraint and  thus  deﬁnes  semantic  properties.   These  datatype  deﬁnitions  are required  for  generic  XML  processors  to  function  properly.  Some  DOM implementations can, for example, locate an element by its ID. Therefore the processor must know which element attributes must be treated as IDs. It relies on the semantics of the ID datatype.  XML Schema goes a step further and allows datatype deﬁnitions for XML elements, too. The standard already deﬁnes a rich ensemble of data- types  but  also  allows  users  to  deﬁne  their  own  datatypes.  User-deﬁned datatypes  are  derived  from  existing  datatypes  by  adding  constraining facets to them.  The datatypes in XML Schema allow users to specify a given document element  as  string,  date,  numeric,  and  so  on.  This  allows  generic  XML processors to check a given document more thoroughly. It also improves XML-OO  mapping:  when  an  OO  class  hierarchy  is  generated  from  an XML  Schema  deﬁnition,  the  generator  can  automatically  produce  the correct datatypes for the ﬁelds representing the elements. This is not pos- sible from a DTD.  However, this is where XML Schema stops. It only allows putting con- straints in the form of datatypes onto individual elements; it does not al- low the deﬁnition of constraints across multiple elements  if we forget the unique key keyref constraints for a moment . Let’s look at an example:  Datatypes  Cross-ﬁeld constraints         210   297   Here we can use datatype deﬁnitions to make sure that both width and height are numbers. We can even deﬁne minimum and maximum values for  both.  However,  in  XML  Schema  there  is  no  way  to  deﬁne  that   must always be   multiplied by 1.414, as is the case with the DIN A paper formats.   174  Chapter 4 Meaning  4.2 ONTOLOGIES  Deﬁnition  Semantic  modeling  has  a  tradition  in  knowledge  engineering  and  in agent technology but is also applied to many other ﬁelds in information technology,  such  as  database  design,  object-oriented  analysis,  informa- tion retrieval, and so on. In these areas, the term “ontology” is used to denote  a  knowledge  domain  or  the  semantic  domain  for  an  agent  Uschold and Gruninger 1996 :  Ontologies are agreements about shared conceptualizations. Shared concep- tualizations  include  conceptual  frameworks  for  modelling  domain  knowl- edge;  content-speciﬁc  protocols  for  communication  among  inter-operating agents; and agreements about the representation of particular domain theo- ries. In the knowledge sharing context, ontologies are speciﬁed in the form of deﬁnitions of representational vocabulary. A very simple case would be a type hierarchy, specifying classes and their subsumption relationships. Relational database schemata also serve as ontologies by specifying the relations that can  exist  in  some  shared  database  and  the  integrity  constraints  that  must hold for them.  Tom Gruber, 1994, SRKB Mailing list   The term “ontology” has its origin in philosophy, in which it refers to the discipline that deals with the subject of existence. Ontology is the theory of “what there is”  Quine . In our context, however, the meaning of the term is slightly different: it is a formal description of the concepts and relationships that exist within a domain  and as such is not a disci- pline but an artifact . This means that an ontology relates to a speciﬁc vo- cabulary and a speciﬁc language  other than the philosophical discipline, which deals with existence but not language . Note that an ontology is an agreement. This agreement need not necessarily cover the whole con- ceptualization of a given domain but can cover just a part of it; that is, it can provide a view onto the domain. An ontology thus acts as a contract between partners, enabling them to communicate safely within the con- text of the information domain. For example, a software agent that com- mits to an ontology will be able to semantically interpret the information items covered by that ontology and to communicate with other agents committing to that ontology. Thus, an ontology establishes a community of Internet users.  Vocabulary  4.2.1 Ontological Depth In the simplest form an ontology is just a vocabulary. In this sense, a DTD can deﬁne an ontology. If different partners agree on a DTD, they also agree on the ontology deﬁned through the DTD because the tag names declared in the DTD deﬁne a common vocabulary. When, for example,   4.2 Ontologies  175  Taxonomy  Relational system  Axiomatic theory  Constraints revisited  two agents agree to share such an ontology, they can exchange messages using the vocabulary of the ontology.  However, the deﬁnition of an ontology does not stop here. As we ex- plained earlier, the meaning of terms is established by deﬁning relation- ships between them. One of the most natural relationships is classiﬁca- tion—establishing relationships between objects and classes, subclasses, and parent classes. A system of such relationships is called a taxonomy, and the relationships are usually called is-a relationships. This sort of on- tology is typically established by object-oriented systems. Many existing ontologies are deﬁned using only those hierarchical relationships.  However, ontologies can also include nonhierarchical relationships. As we have seen in the previous example and in previous chapters, there are many possible relationships between objects besides the hierarchical is-a relationships. For example, the relationship is-driven-by between car and driver is not a hierarchical relationship but is important enough to be de- scribed in an ontology. Such relationships are typical in entity relation- ship diagrams and in relational databases, and consequently each rela- tional database schema deﬁnes its own ontology.  Besides  describing  relationships,  ontologies  can  also  impose  con- straints.  Constraints  are  deﬁned  as axioms. An  axiom  is  a  logical  state- ment that cannot be proved from other statements but from which other statements  can  be  derived.  In  mathematics,  whole  theories   like  group theory or set theory  are derived from relatively small sets of axioms. In our car ontology, the statement “A car has at least three wheels” is such a constraint.  In  relational  databases  constraints  are  deﬁned  via  integrity rules. Some  object-oriented  languages  also  include  the  ability  to  deﬁne constraints  e.g., assertions in C++ and contracts in Eiffel .  Thalheim   2000   classiﬁes  constraints  into  a  hierarchy.  Under  static  constraints, he includes the following:    Structural: These include conditions about the structure of the model,  about relationships between entities, and so on.    Semantic: These  include  semantic  restrictions,  such  as  multivalued   cross-ﬁeld  dependencies.    Representational: These are used to constrain the actual representation  of the model in a system to a certain physical structure.    Design: These are used to make the schema design more user friendly.  Under dynamic constraints, he includes the following:    Transition: These restrict the application of operations depending on  the current state of an object.    Temporal: These constrain the possible state sequences.   176  Chapter 4 Meaning  Deontic logic  Constraints may depend on the context or the application. A dynamic constraint that inhibits, for example, changing the value of the attribute family_status from  “widowed”  to  “never  married”  makes  sense  in  the context of a business process but must not be applied when we want to correct a wrong data entry.  While static constraints are closely related to schema deﬁnitions and databases   relational  databases,  for  example,  can  protect  the  structural and referential integrity of data with the help of integrity rules and trig- gers , dynamic constraints are closely related to process models. A busi- ness process deﬁnes the possible state changes of a set of business objects, which business events cause these state changes, and which operations are triggered by these state changes.  It is not always possible to enforce constraints, especially in electronic business scenarios that involve communication across company borders. It is often only possible to postulate a desired behavior of a system.  Soft  constraints  are  used  here  to  model  the  “should”  instead  of  the “must”  Thalheim 2000 . Using soft constraints requires a different logi- cal calculus: deontic logic is used to formulate soft constraints and to rea- son about them. Deontic logic allows reasoning about the ideal, norma- tive,  and  actual  behavior  of  the  system.  Deontic  logic  adds  three  new operators to the classic predicate logic:    Prohibitions  F  specify that certain actions or states are forbidden.   Obligations  O  specify normative behavior—which actions and states  are desirable.    Permissions  P  specify states or actions that are permitted.  However, formulating soft constraints properly is not trivial. Deontic logic tends to produce paradoxical results, and in reality there often exist obligations  that  contradict  each  other.  Such  conﬂicts  must  be  handled somehow, for example, by prioritizing the application of constraints.  Often,  the  use  of  soft  constraints  can  be  avoided  by  using  context- sensitive  hard  constraints.   Remember  that  contexts  can  change  over time.   Our  previous  example  is  such  a  case.  We  could   sloppily   formulate that the family status “never married” should never follow “widowed.” An application that would try to do so would get a warning. The better choice,  however,  is  to  make  this  constraint  a  context-sensitive  “must” rule, that is, not to apply it during maintenance tasks but to enforce it in all other tasks.  But back to ontologies. Guarino and Welty  1998  deﬁne several levels  Ontology levels  of ontological depth:   4.2 Ontologies  177  1. Lexicon: vocabulary with natural language deﬁnitions 2. Simple Taxonomy 3. Thesaurus: taxonomy plus related terms 4. Relational model: unconstrained use of arbitrary relations 5. Fully axiomatized theory  Ontologies that only implement level 1  a vocabulary  are, however, of limited use. They may help simplify and standardize data exchange be- tween partners but do not allow machines to reason about the meaning of an information item.  This only becomes possible at deeper levels. When we, for example, want to build a house, the machine could automatically look up a rela- tional model to ﬁnd out that we need artisans like bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians to build the house. This is possible because in this ontol- ogy these terms are related to the term “house” via a semantic web.  At this stage it is important to note that all relations within an ontol- ogy  are  “intentional”—they  refer  to  conceptional  items   symbols   and not to “the real thing.” In our example, relations are established between the conceptional terms “house,” “bricklayers,” “carpenters,” and “electri- cians,” but not to real houses, real bricklayers, and so on. In Section 7.2 we will discuss how such a conceptional network of relations is ﬁnally mapped onto real resources.  The last stage in ontology deﬁnition, the fully axiomatized theory, is usually too hard to obtain in practical applications. Most applications use a limited set of constraints that are obtained from heuristic analysis but that are far from a complete and consistent set of axioms able to found a mathematical  theory.  Nevertheless,  the  use  of  constraints  is  important and adds signiﬁcantly to data integrity and consistency.  Clearly, with each level more work is required to deﬁne an ontology. This is true not only for the initial deﬁnition but also for maintenance. Adding  a  new  word  to  a  lexicon  is  a  fairly  simple  task,  but  on  deeper levels we also have to add new relations, update existing relations, and check constraints for consistency.  When we said that a relational database schema deﬁnes an ontology, we were at the root of the problem. There are as many ontologies as there are database schemata in the world—and consequently ontologies are a hot topic. In a time of company mergers, enterprise application integra- tion,  Internet  portals,  and  supply  chain  integration,  ontologies  clash fairly often and must be reconciled. In the past, the traditional tactic used with EDI was to negotiate bilateral agreements. However, this is hardly  A myriad of ontologies   178  Chapter 4 Meaning  sufﬁcient to meet the demands of a networked and globalized business community.  Several researchers  Uschold et al. 1997; Smith and Zaibert 1997  and institutions have therefore started to deﬁne ontologies that can be used as a common platform within an industry or a sector of an industry. The introduction of XML, in particular, has led to widespread activity in the deﬁnition of shared ontologies, which has resulted in a rich collection of industry-speciﬁc  XML  DTDs.  These  deﬁnitions  can  only  be  the  begin- ning, since simple shared vocabularies as provided by DTDs are not really satisfactory, as we stated earlier.  M  F L  The intention of these activities is not to convert existing systems, but to deﬁne a “pivot”  or top-level  ontology that can provide a common language  with  which  incompatible  systems  can  communicate.  Such  a pivot ontology can be shared by a large community of users. Instead of negotiating a communication protocol between any two partners on a bi- lateral  basis,  it  is  only  necessary  to  deﬁne  the  translation  between  the proprietary  system  and  the  shared  pivot  ontology.  By  now  there  are  a large number of such top-level ontologies. The HL-7 standard, for exam- ple, establishes a top-level ontology for the health industry. In electronic business communication the situation is a bit more fractionated, since several  organizations  have  deﬁned  competing  standards.  With  ebXML, UN CEFACT has started a standardization process that should result in a top-level ontology for electronic business communication. We will dis- cuss ebXML in Section 10.3.  T  E  A  Y    Top-level ontologies: These are shared by a large community and deﬁne  only very general terms.    Domain-related ontologies  vertical : These apply to a certain knowledge domain, for example, an industry sector such as the pharmaceutical industry or the computer industry.    Task-related ontologies  horizontal : These apply to a certain task, for ex-  ample, procurement or software requirements analysis.    Application-related ontologies: These describe the concepts of an appli- cation, referring to specialization of both a domain and a task ontol- ogy.  Within  an  application-related  ontology,  the  items  deﬁned  in  a domain-related ontology appear mostly in a speciﬁc role.  Ontologies are used during different stages of the application life cycle. Software applications can be constructed as ontology-aware or ontology- driven applications—the ontology is actively used by the application at  Team-Fly®  Building communities  When and where  Ontology types  Guarino  1998  identiﬁes four types of ontologies:   4.2 Ontologies  179  runtime.  This  is,  for  example,  the  case  with  software  agents.  Software agents are usually constructed as specialist applications that operate only within a narrowly deﬁned domain. Larger-scale applications involve a va- riety  of  specialist  agents  that  are  required  to  communicate  with  each other. In order to understand the meaning of the messages exchanged, agents must be able to access and interpret the underlying ontology.  Another example is query processing. Internet portals that combine a multitude of different businesses and services under one roof, for exam- ple, must be able to relate customer queries to the underlying ontologies  mostly database schemata  of the participating partners. To interpret a query correctly, they need access to the proper ontology.  During software development the use of ontologies can save time and money.  By  using  an  ontology  we  can  make  sure  that  the  participating software analysts, designers, and programmers talk the same language. By separating  the  deﬁnition  of  ontologies  proper  into  top-level  ontology, domain- and task-related ontologies, and application-related ontologies, we can make sure that we can reuse previous deﬁnitions. Especially for top-level ontologies, but also for domain-related ontologies, we can often reuse existing designs  such as DTDs, ebXML scenarios, or electronic busi- ness languages  that have already been deﬁned by industry associations, standardization bodies, or manufacturers of electronic business systems. It  is  also  a  good  idea  to  build  up  libraries  of  domain-  and  task-related ontologies.  There are three main areas in software systems where ontologies are used. First, most business applications are database based, and each data- base  schema  incarnates  an  ontology.  As  we  mentioned  earlier,  naviga- tional software systems such as Internet applications require partners to publish “maps” for their systems. This includes the publication of all or parts of the underlying conceptual models of the database schemata in- volved. That is, the ontology deﬁned by the conceptual database model must be described in an appropriate way.  Publishing a database schema itself is of limited use because relational normalization and optimization can obscure the concept behind the design.   Second, especially with relational database technology, a lot of concep- tual knowledge is actually not contained in the database schemata but is contained in the application in the form of SQL commands and program logic. Applications contain knowledge not only about the data, but also about  business  processes.  Although  legacy  applications  contain  this knowledge  in  hard-coded  form  within  the  program  logic,  the  current trend is toward the explicit representation of that knowledge in the form   180  Chapter 4 Meaning  of soft-coded business rules. Again, the explicit use of ontologies can help to document this knowledge in a consistent form, allowing this knowl- edge to be reused in other projects or to be utilized by software agents.  Finally, ontologies can be used with user interfaces. One possible appli- cation is the authoring of help pages. With a clearly deﬁned and pub- lished ontology, an end user can get information about the meaning of terms and how they are related to each other.  The constraints deﬁned in an ontology can be used to validate user in- put. An example of this would be XForms, which not only can validate user  input  according  to  the  datatype  deﬁnitions  in  the  corresponding XML Schema but also can apply other constraints. The relations between conceptual entities deﬁned in an ontology can be used to generate auto- matic document layouts. Current commercial systems  such as K-inﬁnity from intelligent views, www.i-views.de  are able, for example, to produce documents  where  semantically  interrelated  topics  are  placed  close  to- gether, if possible on the same Web page.  4.2.2 Operational Ontologies: DAML and OIL  OIL   Ontology  Interchange  Language   includes  a  whole  family  of  lan- guages such as Standard OIL, Instance OIL, and Heavy OIL. It has also been used as the basis for deﬁning the ontology markup language DAML- Ont  “DAML” stands for DARPA Agent Markup Language . DAML-OIL  a version  of  the  DAML  language   is  very  close  to  Standard  OIL.  We  will restrict ourselves to a discussion of Standard OIL  Bechhofer et al. 2000 . Current implementations of OIL rely on proprietary representations or on RDF. For better readability we use here an informal notation that, if required, can easily be translated into XML or RDF.  The basic constructs of OIL are classes, slots, and individuals. Individu- als are instances of classes. Classes constitute a class hierarchy—a class can be a subclass of other classes:  class-def holding  subclass-of enterprise  class-def enterprise  subclass-of organization  Classes can have multiple parents:  class-def owning-director  subclass-of director owner  Basic constructs   4.2 Ontologies  181  Axioms allow the assertion of additional facts about the classes within  an ontology:    disjoint:  Speciﬁes  a  list  of  classes.  No  individual  is  allowed  to  be  a  member of more than one of the classes listed:  disjoint enterprise government-institution  This states that no individual can be both an enterprise and a govern- ment institution.    covered: Speciﬁes a class that must be covered by a list of other classes. Each individual belonging to that class must belong to at least one of the classes from the list:  covered employee by director manager worker    disjoint-covered: Same as covered, except that the classes speciﬁed in  the list are also disjoint.    equivalent: Deﬁnes a list of synonym class names.  Classes can own slots. Slots represent properties  i.e, on the instance level, slots contain values  and can be used to deﬁne relations between in- stances. Slots can be deﬁned as subslots of other slots:  Slots can also be deﬁned as an inverse of an already existing slot:  slot-def has-director  subslot-of has-manager  slot-def manages  inverse has-manager  So far, OIL closely resembles the entity relationship model. It exceeds  the capabilities of ERM when it comes to the deﬁnition of constraints:    Slot values can be constrained to be of a particular type:  slot-constraint has-director  value-type director    Valid value types can also be declared as an enumeration of individual  value types:  slot-constraint has-partner  value-type  one-of customer supplier shareholder    182  Chapter 4 Meaning    Slot values can be constrained to be of a particular cardinality:  slot-constraint has-director  max-cardinality 3 director min-cardinality 1 director    Slot values can be constrained to be of a particular value  also called  ﬁller . A ﬁller value refers to one or more individuals.  class-def plc  subclass-of enterprise slot-constraint has-company-form  has-filler proprietary_limited    Slot value constraints can also use order relations such as min, less-  than, greater-than, equal, and range to refer to individuals:  class-def large-company  subclass-of enterprise slot-constraint employee-number  has-filler min 500    Slot value constraints can be written as expressions using the Boolean  operators and, or, and not:  slot-constraint external-owner   owner and  not owning-director    Further, slots can be deﬁned with additional properties that improve the ability to make logical deductions from slot properties. Valid proper- ties are:    Transitive:  If  both   x,y   and   y,z   are  instances  of  the  slot,  then   x,z   must also be an instance of the slot:  slot-def bigger-than  properties transitive  For example, if company A is bigger-than company B and company B is  bigger-than company  C,  then  company  A  is  bigger-than com- pany C.    Symmetric: If  x,y  is an instance of the slot, then  y,x  must also be an  instance of the slot:  slot-def business-partner  properties symmetric   4.2 Ontologies  183  For example, if company A is a business-partner to company B, then company B is also a business-partner to company A.    Functional: If  x,y  is an instance of the slot, then there is no z unequal to y such that  x,z  is an instance of the slot. Note that the properties functional and transitive are mutually exclusive.  slot-def has-sole-owner  properties functional  For example, if company A is the sole owner of company B, then com- pany B cannot be owned by another company  including the owner of company A .  In addition to the OIL deﬁnitions, OIL ﬁles contain a container ele- ment with metadata describing the ﬁle. The container element follows the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set  DCMI 2000  and contains ele- ments such as title, creator, subject, description, publisher, type, format, identiﬁer, source, language, and so on.  The current version of OIL suffers from a few limitations:  Limitations    No support for constraints across slots: Each slot constraint affects only a single slot. Multivalued constraints such as width*height*depth < 100 cannot be speciﬁed.    No  default  reasoning   only  monotonic  logic :  In  OIL,  subclasses  can  in- herit values from superclasses but cannot overwrite inherited slot val- ues. If we have, for example, a class bird with the slot main-method-of- movement and a ﬁller value of “ﬂying,” we would have trouble when declaring the class emu as a subclass of bird. This could lead to major restructuring activities when an existing ontology is extended.    No  support  for  second-order  logic:  A  reiﬁcation  mechanism   such  as  in  RDF  does not exist in OIL.  4.2.3 Best Practices  We recommend the following practices:    If a vocabulary is already used by the users in the targeted domain, use  this vocabulary.    If different vocabularies are commonly used in the targeted domain, use these vocabularies and provide a mapping between them. For ex- ample, in an ornithology ontology you would provide a vocabulary of bird  names  in  common  English  and  one  in  scientiﬁc  Latin  names.   184  Chapter 4 Meaning  Users  should  be  able  to  extend  these  mappings     i.e.,  specify  more synonyms .    Provide a semantic deﬁnition for each term. This should be accessible  by users who require an explanation of a term.   Use a classiﬁcation that is familiar to the user.   Use namespaces to allow the later merging of ontologies.  4.3 PHILOSOPHICAL EXCURSUS  In the Western world, the Greek philosopher Aristotle  384–322 B.C.  has been  the  reference  point  for  ontology  questions  for  more  than  2,000 years. For Aristotle, the formal model of logic consists of a single subject  the  Me   making  statements  about  the  world  of  objects   the  Not-Me . Within such a dualistic construction, statements are either true or false. In fact, “tertium non datur”  i.e., the rejection of logical values other than “True” and “False”  is a fundamental axiom of Aristotelian logic.  The  philosophical  system  of  Aristotle  was  adopted  for  the  Catholic Church by Thomas Aquinas  1225–1274  and thus has deeply inﬂuenced thinking in the Western world. During the whole medieval age the teach- ings of the Catholic Church served as the only possible view for inter- preting the world. The majority of people lived in an ideologically consis- tent and coherent environment. Communities that favored a  slightly  different view of the world were prosecuted as heretics.  During the 16th century, this “one and only ontology” world would be severely shattered by the developing natural sciences. Nicolaus Coperni- cus  1473–1543  and Galileo Galilei  1564–1642  challenged the geocen- tric view of the universe and replaced it with a heliocentric view of our solar system. The reaction of the Catholic Church is well recorded. Ear- lier, the German reformer Martin Luther  1483–1546  had challenged the ideological  basis  of  the  Catholic  Church,  and  for  the  ﬁrst  time  in  me- dieval Europe people had a choice between two belief systems. The dom- inant and monolithic ideology of medieval Europe had received its ﬁrst crack. There were more to follow.  Philosophers, however, needed a bit longer to get used to the idea that there was more than one possible worldview. The possibility of multiple ontologies was ﬁrst mentioned by the German philosopher Georg Wil- helm Friedrich Hegel  1770–1831 .  In  the  20th  century  it  was  the  philosopher  Gotthard  Günther  who combined  a  system  of  multiple  ontologies   polycontexturality   with  a  Aristotle  Thomas Aquinas  Copernicus and Galileo  Hegel  Günther   4.4 Context  185  multileveled logic calculus  Günther 1979 . Günther replaced the Aris- totelian  one-observer  view  of  the  world  with  a  society  of  multiple  ob- servers. Each of these observers may live in a different contexture  i.e., so- cial, cultural, ethical systems  and may arrive at different models of the same world. If these observers do not communicate with each other, each of  them  has  its  own  Aristotelian  view  of  the  world.  The  “tertium  non datur” still holds for each of them. However, if the observers communi- cate and gather intelligence about each other’s worldviews, they will have to drop the “tertium non datur” axiom. Besides their own world model, they have to recognize the world models of others. Günther formalized this  model  by  using  different  levels  of  logical  values.  The  immediate worldviews of an observer can be expressed in the ﬁrst level of logical val- ues, such as True1 and False1. A world model acquired from another ob- server  is  expressed  with  second-level  logical  values,  such  as  True2 and False2.  A  world  model  acquired  from  another  observer  via  a  third  ob- server is expressed with third-level values, and so on.  It is obvious that, although within the primary worldview the old Aris- totelian values of “True” and “False” are still intact, they now do not have the same rigidity as before because we acknowledge the possibility that alternate worldviews might be correct as well.  Also obvious is that by default the communication between observers can only be of an informal nature. Consistent logical systems are only de- ﬁned within a given context and, in general, cannot be used for knowl- edge transfer between different ontologies. The consequence for daily life is that some means of informal communication, such as natural language or heuristic mediation systems, is inevitable.  Consequences  4.4 CONTEXT  The development of common, shared ontologies can formalize the previ- ously  mentioned  communication  process,  but  the  development  of  a shared ontology  such as the negotiation of a shared XML vocabulary  must rely on informal means.  At present this task is left to humans and requires not only technical but also social and political skills. Although it is possible to “lift” knowl- edge from a limited context into a more general context and to “tran- scend” knowledge  McCarthy 1998  from one context into another, the rules for “lifting” and “translating” must be deﬁned by humans. Humans can traverse multiple contexts with relative ease because they do not rely  Human skills   186  Chapter 4 Meaning  on formalized logic models.  On the other hand, they are also prone to misinterpretation and errors.  When two individuals or groups establish communication, they can rely on several things:    Humans  are  usually  familiar  with  several  contexts.  For  example,  a lawyer is not only a lawyer, but also a car driver, a husband or wife, a citizen, a cat lover, and so on. Communication with a partner becomes possible when both partners share at least one context.    Humans share one common context: the experience of the real world. This includes the experience of one’s own body. Bodily functions  e.g., eating, sleeping  are universal.    Even foreign contexts are often very similar in structure. If you learn, for example, a foreign language or a computer language, learning a sec- ond foreign language or a second computer language will be much eas- ier because some concepts and patterns are very similar.    Humans  can  use  metaphors;  that  is,  they  can  transcend  experience from one context to another context. In concurrent computing, for ex- ample, we say that a thread goes to sleep, thus using a term that origi- nally describes one of our bodily functions. Or, even if I am not a me- chanic,  I  can  have  a  clear  idea  about  what  a  T-bar  is  because  I  can associate the shape of the bar with the shape of the letter T.  As  John  McCarthy   1998   observed,  the  human  ability  to  transcend between contexts is a precondition for making scientiﬁc discoveries and also for understanding somebody else’s scientiﬁc discoveries.  4.4.1 Ontologies and Contexts  What now is the relationship between ontology and context? An ontol- ogy deﬁnes the vocabulary, the axioms, and the constraints of a certain problem domain. The context, in contrast, deﬁnes the set of assumptions that must hold to make the vocabulary, the axioms, and the constraints valid. The context determines which terms belong to the vocabulary and which axioms and which constraints are formulated. Depending on the context, this can even lead to contradictory statements: “Vampires do not exist” and “Vampires always hop” cannot both be true in the same ontol- ogy. Vampires that do not exist can obviously not hop. However, the ﬁrst statement is valid in the context of the European Enlightenment, and the second statement is true in the context of Chinese horror movies.  Or consider a rule that might be used to control a robot: “Item A is above item B if item A is on top of item B.” This sentence is obviously   4.4 Context  187  Lessons from Cyc  only true in the context of gravity. Under zero gravity the expression “on top of” makes no sense at all and should not be in our vocabulary.  Even  structural  relationships  can  depend  on  context.  As  we  already mentioned in Section 3.2.5, the entity StreetAddress can be modeled as a property of the business object customer within the context of procure- ment but would be modeled as a business object in its own right within the context of direct mail or utilities.  Some contexts are fairly simple and include only a few assumptions. ebXML, for example, lists possible context drivers that determine the spe- ciﬁc contextual assumptions for ebXML artifacts  see Section 10.3 . But in general contexts are rich—they contain so many assumptions that they cannot be completely listed  Guha 1995 :  Contexts are objects in the domain, i.e., we can make statements about con- texts. They are rich objects in that a context cannot be completely described. The contextual effects on an expression are often so rich that they cannot be captured completely in the logic. This is what leads us to incorporate contexts as objects in our ontology.  R. V. Guha and John McCarthy collaborated in the formulation of an algebra of contexts. Practical application of this theory was the introduc- tion of contexts into the Cyc knowledge base, a “common sense” knowl- edge base ﬁlled over 12 years with facts about this world and now con- taining over 1 million rules  Lenat 2001 :  The third, and perhaps most important lesson we learned along the way was that it was foolhardy to try to maintain consistency in one huge ﬂat CYC knowledge  base.  We  eventually  carved  it  up  into  hundreds  of  contexts  or microtheories. Each one of those is consistent with itself, but there can be contradictions among them. Thus, in the context of working in an ofﬁce it’s socially unacceptable to jump up screaming whenever good things happen, while in the context of a football game it’s socially unacceptable not to.  Guha and McCarthy developed an algebra for operations between con- texts. This algebra is based on the operator ist c,p , which stands for p is true in context c. Note that this statement is valid in some outer context c’  we cannot make statements without being in a context . Therefore the complete expression would be written as c’ : ist c,p , but usually the ab- breviated version ist c,p  is used.  The goal of this algebra is to enable AI systems to navigate between dif- ferent contexts. To solve a particular problem we can move from an outer context  into  a  particular  context   enter  context  p ,  solve  the  problem there, and move back to the outer context  exit context p . Statements valid in a particular context can be lifted into a more general context. For   188  Chapter 4 Meaning  Exceptions  Nonmonotonic reasoning  Y  F L  example, the statement “Item A is above item B if item A is on top of item B” is true in a context where gravity is greater than zero. This statement can be lifted into a gravity-independent context by adding a clause: “Item A is above item B if item A is on top of item B and gravity is greater than zero.” The operations of entering a context, exiting a context, and lifting statements  can  be  fully  formalized.  This  allows  the  modularization  of large knowledge bases  as in the case of Cyc .  In many cases specialized contexts can establish an exception from the  more general context. Here is an example:    A regatta is a race between boats.   Boats travel on water.  A  M  E  From these two statements it should follow that a regatta takes place on water.  But  not  so  in  Alice  Springs,  Central  Australia.  The  annual  Todd River Regatta does not take place on water for the simple reason that the river is dry.  The boats have holes in the bottom for the crew to put their feet through.  In this special context, regattas do not take place on water. This  example  also  explains  the  difference  between  monotonic  and nonmonotonic reasoning. In monotonic reasoning, when a statement P follows from a set of statements A and additional statements are added to A, then P remains true. This is not the case with nonmonotonic reason- ing. Adding new statements to A can cause P to become false. This is ex- actly what happens when we move from a wider context  all regattas  to a  narrower  context   the  Todd  River  Regatta .  Because  the  context  now contains an additional assumption  dry riverbed , our theory about re- gattas comes to a different conclusion.  Prospective regatta participants should be aware that in years when the Todd River carries water the re- gatta is canceled.   T  The question, of course, is, Couldn’t we design a correct model from the start so that we do not need nonmonotonic reasoning? The answer is that this is not always possible. When we formulate our model, we might not know all possible exceptions that could violate our knowledge base. Especially in an open environment such as the World Wide Web, it is al- most certain that at some stage we will discover exceptions to the rule. Nonmonotonic reasoning allows us to add these new cases as explicit ex- ceptions  to  the  knowledge  base,  instead  of  completely  remodeling  the whole knowledge base.  But  back  to  contexts.  Although  we  have  a  formal  model  for  the  re- lationship between outer, more general contexts and inner, more special- ized contexts, we have no model for the relationships between arbitrary  Team-Fly®   4.4 Context  189  contexts.  We  cannot  formalize  a  general  theory  to  transcend context  McCarthy 1998 :  Human intelligence involves an ability that no-one has yet undertaken to put into computer programs—namely the ability to transcend the context of one’s beliefs.  Consequently, AI systems that must translate between different con- texts have to be told how. A human knowledge engineer has to deﬁne the rules for the mediation between different contexts.  4.4.2 Binding to Contexts: Schema Adjunct  And now back to XML. Earlier we mentioned that each database schema forms an ontology. If this is so, what is the context of such an ontology? Clearly, the context of a database schema is represented by the applica- tions  and possible future applications  that access this database schema. The deﬁnition and layout of the database schema are founded on certain assumptions  about  how  this  schema  will  be  used.  These  assumptions were analyzed during the design phase of the database applications. The ﬁnal  applications  incarnate  those  assumptions.  The  binding  between applications and database schemata is usually hardwired.  A  similar  logic  applies  to  XML.  Although  XML  documents  contain some of their metadata in the form of tags and attributes, they do not contain information about implicit assumptions that should be known when  the  document  is  processed.  Consequently  the  context  for  XML schemata  is  set  by  the  applications  and  services  that  process  the  XML instances.  A speciﬁc feature of XML is the hierarchical structure of document ele- ments. This can be translated into a hierarchy of contexts, starting with the widest context on the root level and continuing with narrower con- texts on the child level, and so on.  We can therefore describe a binding between document and context for each document element separately. For example, if we want to bind the document to an object-oriented application, the most natural way is to replicate the document structure by an isomorphic class structure. In other cases—especially if we want to bind an XML document to already existing  applications  or  services—the  binding  may  not  be  so  straight- forward.  Traditionally,  those  bindings  take  the  form  of  hardwired  pro- gram code that in some way interprets the output of SAX or DOM parsers and takes appropriate action.  Context in XML  Binding to a context   Chapter 4 Meaning  190  SAF  A more ﬂexible approach is possible by means of the Schema Adjunct Framework   SAF .  SAF  describes  the  binding  between  XML  document nodes and application functions in a declarative way  Buck 2000 :  To process XML instances for a given schema, many environments need addi- tional information which is typically not available in the schema itself. Such information includes mappings to relational databases, indexing parameters for native XML databases, business rules for additional validation, interna- tionalization and localization parameters, or parameters used for presentation and input forms. Some of this information is used for domain-speciﬁc valida- tion, some to provide information for domain-speciﬁc processing.  The Schema Adjunct Framework has a two-layer architecture:    The adjunct: The adjunct introduces additional information not con- tained in the document schema. The adjunct speciﬁes additional se- mantic information such as constraints and operations in an abstract way. The adjunct itself is formulated in XML syntax, too. The concept used to attach additional information to document elements is similar to the concept used in Schematron  see Section 2.9 .    The adjunct processor: The processor is implemented in a suitable imple- mentation language  XSLT, Java, C++, and so on . It interprets the doc- ument  instance,  schema,  and  adjunct.  Based  on  the  abstract  opera- tions deﬁned in the adjunct, the adjunct processor mediates between the document and a target application.  Let’s look at an example  see Figure 4.1 . We have deﬁned an XML doc- ument  type  representing  customer  records.  We  want  to  map  these  in- stance  documents  to  database  tables  in  a  relational  database,  and  we want  to  generate  HTML  forms  for  updating  customer  entries  from  the XML documents. We deﬁne one adjunct that associates SQL tables and columns with the elements of our customer document. A generic adjunct processor for SQL reads the adjunct information and mediates between the  XML  datastreams  and  the  SQL  database.  Because  this  processor  is generic, we can use it for other document types, too.  To translate the XML documents into HTML forms, we deﬁne another adjunct  that  associates  the  document  elements  with  abstract  form  ele- ments. Here we use two different adjunct processors. One translates doc- ument  instances—based  on  the  adjunct  information—into  HTML.  The second processor accepts the input data from the HTML form and trans- lates it back—again based on the adjunct information—into an XML doc- ument.  Although  the  ﬁrst  processor  could  be  written  as  an  XSLT  style sheet, the second processor would probably be implemented in the form of a Java servlet. Here is the code:   4.4 Context  191  r o s s e c o r P   t c n u d A  j  L M T H    r o f  r o s s e c o r P   t c n u d A  j  t u p n  I   s  m r o F   r o f  Browser  HTML  Forms Input  User Interface Context  Adjunct for HTML  Forms  XML  Document  Adjunct  for RDBMS    r o s s e c o r P   t c n u d A  j  L Q S   r o f  RDBMS  SQL  Database Context  Figure 4.1 Using the Schema Adjunct Framework to build a simple XML-based application.  <schema-adjunct  ...>  target = “http:  www.softcorp.com product.xsd” xmlns:xfg = “http:  www.softcorp.com xml-form-gen.xsd”               Product name   text   prdnm          Price USD    decimal    192  Chapter 4 Meaning   prdprc         The adjunct refers to an XML Schema deﬁnition  target . Each element clause selects an element for processing  which . The child elements con- tained in each element clause deﬁne abstract operations that are to be in- terpreted by the adjunct processor.  By separating the semantics into an abstract layer and an implementa- tion layer, the Schema Adjunct Framework is well suited to implementing the constraints and operations deﬁned in a conceptual model in a ﬂexible and portable way. The fact that adjunct deﬁnitions are XML documents themselves is an additional advantage: adjunct deﬁnitions can be created, maintained, and parsed with the usual XML tools and, if necessary, can be structurally transformed with the help of XSLT style sheets.   5Modeling Processes  5.1 Concepts of Business  Process Modeling  5.2  Business Process Modeling and Systems Development  5.3 Communication and Cooperation: Toward Agent-Based Systems  5.4  Process Concepts and XML  W hy bother dealing with business processes in this  book at all? Since XML could be looked at as being  a technological basis for integration within the IT domain, we  deﬁnitely have to take processes into account. We have seen  at  least  two  phases  in  IT:  data  integration  and  application  integration. Giving the process paradigm appropriate weight,  5.5 Concluding Remarks  we can observe the phase of integrating processes of mani-  fold kinds in different environments and with arbitrary scope  in their business domains.  That is why in this chapter we will give an overview of pro-  cess modeling, starting with some terminological aspects. We  then present workﬂows as a special perception of processes.  From that we will show some problems in the ﬁeld of process  analysis and modeling and present a somewhat uncommon  perspective  of  business  processes.  These  considerations  are  193   194  Chapter 5 Modeling Processes  Value creation and interaction  based on mechanisms that are known from research on cooperative software agents, speciﬁcally communication-based interaction, cooperation, and coor- dination. Finally we give some hints on applying XML technology to process modeling and implementation.  5.1 CONCEPTS OF BUSINESS PROCESS MODELING  Business processes have proved to be an adequate paradigm in describing value-creating activities within and between enterprises—in both the old economy  and  the  new   or  Internet   economy.  In  turn,  processes  may serve to describe interactions between any participants in Internet plat- forms  e.g., portals, marketplaces, etc. .  Such  “interactions”  refer  to  business  transactions,  which  encompass the collection and exchange of information, the negotiation of contracts, and the exchange of goods. This is part of what is called the “primary market transaction.” The secondary transaction takes place in payment, logistics, and so forth.  Since we face interaction relationships  i.e., communication, synchro- nization, data manipulation, etc.  between entities, we have to consider process  interfaces.  XML-based  formats  in  that  context  may  be  used  to specify process contents and interfaces and thus support the interprocess understanding.  Section 11.3 will give an overview of business formats possibly able to meet this demand. For now, we present some conceptual considerations in approaching the problem of describing or specifying process-oriented contents from a model perspective.  5.1.1 Overview of Process Paradigms  Since we present XML-based modeling approaches for business processes in this section, we ﬁrst have to differentiate several views of the issue. We will not discuss the pros and cons of process paradigms. Instead we will cover the modeling and exchange of process information with respect to exploiting XML and its related developments.  Most  often  processes  are  regarded  as  a  sequence  of  intra-  or  inter- organizational  activities,  tasks,  or  functions  that  represent  some  value creation. The activities may be performed by people or technical devices  e.g., computer-based systems . This perception of a process leads us to the workﬂow paradigm, discussed in Section 5.1.2.   5.1 Concepts of Business Process Modeling  195  Process life cycles  Workﬂow  Alternatively it may be helpful to consider the interaction rather than the operation. By doing so, we have to deal with communication between people and or systems involved in the execution of a process implemen- tation and the agreements made to perform the necessary process steps. Therefore Section 5.4 deals with contract-based, communication-based, and actor-based approaches to process modeling.  An important aspect in process analysis, modeling, and implementa- tion is the ability to handle any changes to the process design over time. In  that  sense  we  may  have  to  deal  with  process  life  cycles  rather  than with static objects. Therefore it may be important for processes to encom- pass the property of self-modiﬁcation. This may in the ﬁrst place refer to adopting changes due to external effects being relevant for the outcome of the process, and therefore the owner of the process, without any need for  manual  manipulation.  Such  an  approach  is  closely  related  to  the actor- or agent-based perspective. An overview is given in Section 5.4.4.  5.1.2 Notion of Workﬂows and Modeling  The concept of a “workﬂow” reﬂects the traditional view of the imple- mentation of processes in organizational environments. Broken down to bare techniques, the workﬂow view implies the modeling of business pro- cesses as sequences of complex activities that may be split into parallel sequences and or partitioned into subsequences or elementary activities  actions . Agents, singly or in a group, are then assigned to execute these activities.  The  prevailing  workﬂow  metaphor  depicts  a  business  process  as  a stream or ﬂow of documents and or  intermediate or ﬁnished  products, processed  stepwise  by  each  agent  in  turn,  that  is,  when  the  particular work piece comes ﬂowing past them, and then passed on toward the next processing  station.  This,  of  course,  very  much  resembles  assembly  line production. Common examples for such workﬂows are the assembly of a tax declaration or the processing of travel expenses.  A basic control element is given by task lists. For each agent or pro- cessing station a task list holds the tasks to be processed next at that sta- tion. An entry in the list encompasses the documents or other objects to be processed as well as the corresponding processing tools.  A workﬂow then is used to describe a well-structured and or standard- ized process, as it can be identiﬁed in public and company administra- tions.  It  is  not  a  useful  instrument  for  ill-structured  processes.  We  will defer discussion of that until later in this section.   196  Chapter 5 Modeling Processes  Workﬂow management systems  Event-driven process chains  Such implementations of workﬂows are workﬂow instances controlled by workﬂow management systems  WFMSs . In contrast the deﬁnition of workﬂows is part of conceptual modeling on the metalevel, that is, the workﬂow  schema.  Thus  a  WFMS  supports  the  metamodeling  of  work- ﬂows  and  allows  the  creation  of  instances  that  it  keeps  track  of.  The Workﬂow  Management  Coalition   WFMC   has  speciﬁed  several  com- ponents  of  an  overall  architecture,  including  interfaces  for  workﬂow deﬁnition  and  cooperation  on  the  workﬂow  engine  level.  For  further information, have a look at www.wfmc.org.  Regarding  common  approaches  to  process  speciﬁcation,  we  select an example  well  known  from  the  enterprise  resource  planning  system SAP R3: event-driven process chains  EPCs . We are not going to discuss the pros and cons of EPCs here. Instead we will present EPCs as a semi- formal modeling approach within this section, a viable solution to mod- eling  workﬂows.  Nonetheless  we  will  sketch  some  of  the  drawbacks  to adequate modeling.  The basic idea of EPCs is to model process behavior as a sequence of events and functions. Events represent temporal or logical conditions to be fulﬁlled before executing a function. A function then may be thought of as a work step to be performed within the context of a business process. Figure 5.1 shows an example of a workﬂow given as an EPC in ARIS  www.ids-scheer.com . While this is a coarse-grained top-level view, func- tions 1, 2A, and 2B are usually decomposed into detailed representations.

Function  2A  Function  2B   5.1 Concepts of Business Process Modeling  197  EPC and process modeling  The  problems  with  using  EPC-like  modeling  approaches  are  many. Some  of  them  are  inherent  to  the  methodology;  others  arise  from  the inadequacy of the tools available for modeling. Here is a summary of the drawbacks that we consider important:    The set of constructional elements, mainly events and functions, stems from the industrial production domain, which is characterized by deal- ing with standardized processes. Process steps are triggered mainly by temporal  conditions.  The  process  is  deterministically  given  by  a  se- quence of actions. This concept is deﬁnitely valid for exactly that class of processes.    The strict alternation of event and action in EPCs does not represent the real world adequately. Events should represent temporal and logi- cal conditions to be fulﬁlled rather than functioning as syntactic sepa- rators within the sequence of functions.    Decomposition for reﬁnement is done on a modular basis. Once the boundaries of a component to be reﬁned have been modeled  via so- called process interfaces , they will not change in the reﬁned versions. So  new  connections  with  other  components  cannot  be  established without explicitly changing the complete model on higher levels of abstraction. In addition, process model graphics are more likely to be decomposed due to the limited place of output media than due to log- ical considerations.    The decomposition problem gives proof that reverse engineering is not supported—or, if so, just to a very limited extent—by the correspond- ing tools.  Section 5.2 includes a further discussion of this topic and the demands  of today’s business environment.  5.1.3 Metamodeling Aspects  Metamodels describe the elements and their relationships within a spe- ciﬁc model type. This means that syntax as well as semantics is deﬁned. Concrete models therefore are built on the concepts that the metamodels describe. Figure 5.2 shows a simpliﬁed metamodel of EPCs, given as an entity relationship model. The connectors, also represented in the meta- model,  allow  the  process  analyst  and  modeler  to  express  parallel  and alternative paths within an EPC, using logical AND, OR, and XOR opera- tors. Additionally a function may be associated with an organizational  Metamodel for EPCs   198  Chapter 5 Modeling Processes  1  Process Interface  1  Organizational  Unit  performs  Event  1  1  Function  1  1  1  is_performed_by  1  1  Connector  1  1 1  may_need  1  Information  Object  1  may_be_needed_by  Y  F L  1  1  M  A  Logical_AND  Logical_OR  E  T  Figure 5.2 Simpliﬁed metamodel of EPCs.  unit that performs the function and an information object needed to per- form the function. From the IT or implementational view, an informa- tion object then may be mapped to a data element stored in a database. The metamodel developed here clearly does not meet the modeling semantics  of  EPCs.  The  construction  procedure  would  require  order- ing rules  such  as  “events  and  functions  are  strictly  alternating  when hiding the connectors” or “let an EPC start with either an event or a pro- cess interface,” where a process interface may represent either an event or a function.  Metamodels are important components in business process manage- ment, and we will make use of them in the following section. From the conceptual perspective they semiformally explain the modeling elements in the particular context. From the perspective of frameworks that sup- port modeling they build the basis for checking mechanisms as well as for model generation  e.g., via appropriate rule-based engines .  Team-Fly®   5.2 Business Process Modeling and Systems Development  199  Metamodels, roughly speaking, function as information models, as do ontologies   see  Section  4.2 .  In  the  process  management  context  they hold process-related knowledge or metainformation to be worked with or to be communicated between software entities.  XML may be employed to specify workﬂows from the perspective of metamodeling as well as from the perspective of the concrete instance of a workﬂow. DTDs may be used for the exchange of such speciﬁcations as well as for the storage of the speciﬁcation in appropriate repositories. The exchange  of  workﬂow  information  between  two  interacting  software components could be realized using advanced schema deﬁnition mecha- nisms, such as the Resource Description Framework  RDF , discussed in Section 3.3.  A  concrete  application  area  for  the  exchange  of  process  information would  be  the  migration  of  workﬂows  in  distributed  workﬂow  manage- ment  environments   e.g.,  for  the  purpose  of  load  balancing .  Since  a workﬂow system can control only the workﬂows that it has some under- standing of, passing control of a workﬂow instance from engine to engine would imply sending the metadata  i.e., the workﬂow schema  as well.  An  example  more  complex  than  what  we  have  presented  here  can be found at www.ebxml.org project_teams business_process wip metamodel  version2.0.pdf.  Section  10.3  presents  ebXML  as  a  process-related  XML technology.  Information models  Workﬂow migration  5.2 BUSINESS PROCESS MODELING  AND SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT  In this section we ﬁrst sketch the current situation in business process   re- engineering  BPE  and point out shortcomings in practice, especially for a certain class of business processes that can be structurally character- ized as being highly dynamic. These are likely to be found in service busi- nesses.  We  present  an  approach  to  business  processes  that  in  general promises  more  adequate  engineering  of  such  conventionally  rather intractable processes.  5.2.1 Background These days there is a growing dissatisfaction with the established way of analyzing and describing business requirements and deriving IT solutions for  the  processes  thus  deﬁned.  This  is  true  even  though  the  concrete understanding of the modeling of, and IT support for, business processes differs from case to case.   200  Chapter 5 Modeling Processes  Business process engineering  Workﬂow classiﬁcation  Workﬂow classiﬁcation  Divergent design and implementation  We consider business process engineering as a paradigm for investigat- ing business information for use in appropriate IT development. We will focus  on  currently  observable  practice,  in  which  processes  are  mostly considered as plain workﬂows, as has been sketched earlier. As a result, and to simplify matters, we generally call these conventional approaches the “workﬂow view” of business activities.  The  main  technique  for  describing  this  kind  of  workﬂow  view  is  a chart, a graphical network, the nodes of which are either events or ac- tions  often called “functions” . In this chart, a starting event precedes an action and a result event follows the action—or more than one result event  if  there  are  alternative  outcomes  of  an  action.  The  result  event of one  action  usually  serves  as  the  starting  event  for  the  next  one,  or result events of several actions are somehow connected to start an action. Alternative  paths   i.e.,  mutually  exclusive  paths   and  parallel  paths through this kind of event-action-chaining net are distinguishable only by the kind of “connectors”  with propositional logic semantics  at path branches  or  junctions.  Well-known  examples  are  event-driven  process chains  in  ARIS   Scheer  and  Nüttgens  2000 ,  as  seen  earlier,  and  the activity diagrams in UML  Fowler and Scott 1997 .  Workﬂows  can  be  executed  using  a  workﬂow  management  system  WFMS .  In  a  WFMS  conﬁguration,  people  or  systems   applications, machines  are assigned to perform the actions by processing documents or work pieces that are usually supplied by WFMS service components. Often workﬂows are classiﬁed into  ill-structured  ad hoc, semistructured, and  well-structured  standard workﬂows. Standard workﬂows are com- pletely supportable by WFMS; semistructured, partly; and ad hoc work- ﬂows, not at all  Back and Seufert 2000 .  Unfortunately,  the  structure  class  of  a  workﬂow  is  often  recognized only after implementing it and then observing its mismatch with reality. The result of the analysis and conception phase may be a nice workﬂow graphic that is commonly agreed upon to exactly describe what happens in the departments under investigation. But the WFMS solution set up accordingly may turn out not to be workable because the workﬂow had almost completely “evaporated” in the course of its implementation and trial.  This  may  be  due  to  the  fact  that  the  initially  analyzed  process  is ad hoc and highly dynamic rather than well structured.  For  greater  ﬂexibility,  newer  WFMSs  have  been  equipped  with exception-handling mechanisms or some means for explicitly allowing deviation in practice. Watering down the workﬂow principles this way demands, naturally, a kind of metacontrol. This may be based on a means of process monitoring to detect diverging behavior of the actors.   5.2 Business Process Modeling and Systems Development  201  Workﬂow appropriateness  Dynamic business processes  The fact that such divergence happens  and that workﬂow designers have  provided  for  “emergency  exits”   is  evidence  of  the  inadequacy not just  of  a  particular  workﬂow  but  rather  of  the  whole  traditional workﬂow concept when applied to business processes that are not really well structured.  The established workﬂow view  the activity- and work-piece-centered view of business processes  is probably inadequate for a whole class of business processes for the following reasons  among others :    It requires a rigid, ﬁxed process structure.   It presupposes that all choices are decidable.   It views agents as being event-triggered. That is, they are called, by the workﬂow, to work on a certain object in a precisely deﬁned way and then sit idle until the next work piece comes ﬂowing by.  The class of processes for which the workﬂow view is inappropriate can be identiﬁed as being complementary to the class of processes for which the workﬂow view initially was conceived  namely, the industrial produc- tion  processes .  For  these,  the  conditions  listed  in  the  preceding  para- graph  hold.  But  for  administrative  or  service  processes,  or  for  highly dynamic business processes generally  those that deal interactively with people , another view is needed. This especially applies to businesses act- ing in changing market conditions and therefore being subject to perma- nent organizational changes.  The degree to which a business process is dynamic affects its potential for automation, which in turn corresponds to the degree of the possible shift  or  delegation  of  responsibility  from  units  involved  in  the  perfor- mance of a business process to units designing  the automation of  a busi- ness process. Instead of narrowing the responsibility of actors to single work  steps  within  a  workﬂow,  designers  need  a  much  wider  scope.  In other words, as far as any actor  human or machine  is intended to be a logical part of some transaction  in the IT sense , decentralized responsi- bility is not possible. And, since responsibility and ﬂexibility are the ﬂip sides  of  the  same  coin,  hopes  for  introducing  ﬂexible  reaction  into  a workﬂow will always be dashed.  5.2.2 What Is a Business Process?  Capturing the dynamics of business processes certainly necessitates addi- tional concepts in modeling: communication, parallelism, nondetermin- ism, and mobility. These concepts have a sound basis in formal process calculi, especially Milner’s π-calculus  Milner 1999 .   202  Chapter 5 Modeling Processes  Deﬁnition of a “business process”  business process as  business-related roles,  Let’s ﬁrst look at the deﬁnition of a “business process.” We regard a    a network of interacting abstract agents, each of them playing certain    working  concurrently,  organizing  their  cooperation  using  preestab-  lished or ad hoc–created communication channels,    implicitly or explicitly using or negotiating contracts with clients or other agents, realizing a cascade of contracts specifying the value cre- ation, where a distinct contract is to achieve given and explicitly stated goals or subgoals, and    where real world agents are assigned to work for the roles they play  i.e., because of their competence , with such assignments spanning organizational structures.  The beneﬁts we expect from this view are many. The degree to which these  beneﬁts  really  become  visible,  however,  depends  on  the  kind  of business and, to a lesser degree, on the kind of enterprise organization: the more service oriented the business and, therefore, the higher the pro- cess dynamics, the greater the beneﬁts of this approach! Let’s look at the beneﬁts from three different perspectives.  Beneﬁts in Process Design The design of a new business process can proﬁt substantially from the following  method:  We  start  by   1   stating  and  decomposing  the  goals that the business process is to meet, then we proceed to  2  derive initial contracts to serve the business goals and to identify “contractors” and the roles they play in a cooperation net. This forward business process engineering may be continued by  3  deﬁning the internal nature of the roles  and  their  external  communication  behavior,  eventually  arriving at a  model  in  which   4   resources  are  allocated  to  roles  and  tasks  and where we, ﬁnally, can  5  use this model conﬁguration to derive require- ments for IT systems to support tasks, roles, and even whole interaction structures.  Process construction  Process reconstruction  Beneﬁts in Process Reengineering Optimization of an existing business process is also greatly facilitated by the changed view of the circumstances. Reengineering a business process ﬁrst requires  an “as is” model of the process. This means in particular the modeling of what it has actually grown into, not what it once was con-   5.2 Business Process Modeling and Systems Development  203  ceived to be and therefore is believed by some managers to still be  but perhaps never was . In such a model, we must determine the degree of support  for  newly  deﬁned  or  persisting  business  goals  by  the  existing business process. Degrees of support can never really be measured if, from the ﬁndings, all aspects that do not ﬁt into an idealized notion of the business must be cut away, as is often the case with the Procrustean bed of  the  workﬂow  view.  When  an  adequate  business  process  model  has been reached, we can reconstruct the roles and, further on, the  implicit!  contracts according to which the roles are observed to act. By examining the reconstructed contracts, the gap between the actual and the desired goal support will become visible, and we can see how contracts and or roles will have to be changed, or what changes have to be made to the inventory of contracts, roles, and tasks, in order to close the gap.  Figure 5.3 summarizes the elements of the reverse and forward engi- neering approaches to process design and their relationship as it is com- monly found in real world projects. “Reverse engineering” denotes the reconstruction of real contracts from given physical situations. “Forward engineering” is constructing ideal contracts from the goals of an enter- prise. A gap analysis on the contract level may also contribute to the eval- uation of process implementations.

This is the usual motivation for business process modeling and BPE. The real problem in improving IT support is deter- mining its purpose and its scope; that is, the problem is identifying the “real” requirements for better IT systems. Directly asking the actual hu- man agent will yield a much too narrow view. But asking a manager will yield a view that is usually more and more idealized and removed from reality the higher up the management hierarchy you go. So, instead of directly asking for requirements, we have to inductively build a model of the whole business environment of an IT system. This procedure might start by asking agents to whom they are talking; what information they are exchanging this way; how they would categorize what they are doing today  and  what  they  did  yesterday  and  the  day  before  that;  which  re- sources  they  use;  how  they  see  their  work  supported  by  IT  systems;  to whom they turn for advice; and so on. That is, we gather information pieces that allow us to build a model of what is really going on  e.g., what interdepartmental shortcuts exist, often with undocumented data ﬂow; what  undocumented  resources  are  used  and  in  what  undocumented ways;  what  undocumented  procedures  have  come  into  existence;  how people  have  tried  to  optimize  their  tasks,  often  only  locally  and  thus sometimes degrading global performance; and much more .  From what has been said so far, it appears that a WFMS is normally not the proper software choice to support business processes in business areas where BPE really shows its beneﬁts. In these cases, a collaborative support system  CSS  may be more appropriate. But, usually, software is needed that is specially geared to the service tasks of the business in question. And there it is important to know the requirements as exactly as possible. So “off-the-shelf” products might not be the answer.  Although such knowledge of real requirements might also be gained in other ways, business process reverse engineering is a viable solution in order to get the basis for optimal IT support of whole business processes or  the  appropriate  parts.  Even  if  only  partial  support  is  needed,  it  is important to reverse engineer the whole business process—or at least as much  as  can  be  done  within  the  limits  of  a  project—in  order  to  get  a complete enough picture.  To sum up, we see the beneﬁts of our approach    for  forward  engineering  of  business  processes,  in  which  design  of  much more ﬂexible processes is facilitated, but also  Beneﬁts in forward and reverse engineering   5.2 Business Process Modeling and Systems Development  205  Continuous change management  Workﬂow change    for business process reverse and reengineering, in which much more adequate modeling allows for more complete and more correct repre- sentation of established processes.  There is another area where the new view promises substantial beneﬁts, although we have not yet explored it sufﬁciently and we do not know exactly, at the present time, how to handle it technically. It is the area of continuous change management, a hot topic in the age of e-business. We expect the mobility concept to be very useful for integrating changes to business processes directly, on the same level, into the business process model. Traditionally, workﬂow changes must be managed in a metalevel model,  whose  objects  are  the  different  versions  of  a  workﬂow  model. That means changes are done to the workﬂow model, not within it. Work- ﬂows  share  this  fate  with  program  sources,  of  course:  that  is  how  the ordinary source management system works. And as with changes to pro- grams,  adapting  a  workﬂow  means  a  whole  run  through  an  editing– recompiling–retesting–reinstalling cycle.  In  a  collection  dealing  with  business  process  management   van  der Anlst,  Desel,  and  Oberweis  2000 ,  where  all  contributors  work  strictly within the workﬂow view, an essay  Ellis and Keddarn 2000  asserts that “a  workﬂow  change  is  a  workﬂow,”  thus  underscoring  the  metalevel problem.  Although  the  modalities  of  change  as  listed  in  the  article,  as well  as  the  techniques  for  change  description  presented  there,  are  also important for a π-calculus-based change management, the mobility fea- ture  of π-calculus  seems  to  allow  changes  to  be  an  integral  part  of  the business  process  model.  Alas,  even  if  we  knew  how  to  handle  such dynamism  within  business  process  engineering,  there  still  remains  the nontrivial task of reﬂecting such changes within the IT systems support- ing  dynamically  changing  business  processes.  Component-based  soft- ware, however, seems to facilitate the needed ﬂexibility. Actually, adding and exchanging components in a running IT system is a research ﬁeld presently addressed on the basis of π-calculus  Henderson 1997 . So, the hope is to demonstrate in the not-too-distant future that business process change is not a business process but an integral feature of a differently, more adequately, engineered business process. We will pick up this aspect again in Section 5.4.4.  5.2.3 Employing Formal Modeling  Imposing  an  inappropriate  “grid”  for  process  description  results  in  the distortion  or  complete  loss  of  important  information.  The  degree  to   206  Chapter 5 Modeling Processes  which this inadequacy becomes obvious depends very much on the busi- ness sector. Workﬂow-oriented business process modeling may indeed be appropriate  for  industrial  manufacturing,  where  we  usually  ﬁnd  well- structured processes, but it is deﬁnitely inadequate for service branches, especially in the ﬁnancial sector, such as insurance companies and banks  although the term “production process” is used in such organizations as well . The latter business sectors do not have the rigid structure of indus- trial  production.  Instead,  there  is  much  more  dynamism  and  change, quite  often  imposed  by  the  rapidly  changing  social  and  legal  environ- ment of these businesses. That is, we ﬁnd mainly ad hoc or semistruc- tured processes. This is certainly true in the current wave of mergers and acquisitions  in  the  ﬁnancial  sector,  with  all  its  organizational  implica- tions, which leads us back to the problem of change management.  Although we have been dealing with rather descriptive aspects so far, this chapter will present a formal modeling approach, based on the con- cepts of Milner’s π-calculus  Milner 1999 . Although this is not the place to fully introduce π-calculus, we will brieﬂy sketch its main features, as far as they are relevant to BPE.  A calculus is  a  collection  of  elements  and  rules  that  specify  how  to combine these elements. A process calculus then is a collection of formal elements that represent physical, social, or formal processes and rules to construct and combine process elements.  Such calculi have been developed to describe and understand the be- havior of complex systems by abstracting from speciﬁc attributes. In par- ticular,  this  may  refer  to  state  transitions  and  concurrency  in  such systems. Examples are petri nets, Hoare’s Communicating Sequential Pro- cesses  CSP , and the Calculus of Communicating Systems  CCS . Com- plex “real world” systems to be investigated may be found as technical, social, or natural processes in machines, electronic devices, communica- tion  systems,  organizations,  enterprises,  societies,  and  other  dynamic systems.  CCS, also developed by Milner around 1980, is meant to describe the observable behavior of parallel processes in process systems. The behavior is given by the interaction, that is, the communication between single processes. Furthermore behavioral equivalence between process systems can be determined, which allows the analysis of systems with regard to building process classes. Process calculi may also allow the description of nondeterminism. So the π-calculus basically adds the concept of mobility. Let’s ﬁrst have a closer look at communication in the π-calculus. Com- munication in that context is a formal act of synchronization or hand-  π-calculus  CCS  Communication channels   5.2 Business Process Modeling and Systems Development  207  shaking between two interacting processes rather than a mechanism to exchange structured messages. Technically communication is performed via channels, referred to by channel names. Channel names can be used only for bilateral communication—but by more than two processes, lead- ing us to one type of nondeterminism.  Process systems are processes existing in parallel, each of which is for- mulated by a so-called process term. These terms basically are sequences of possible communications. Since communications are directed, terms normally encompass sending  outgoing  as well as receiving  incoming  communications.  In Figure 5.4 a process system is given by two parallel processes Travel- Agency and Traveler.  The  two  processes  communicate  via  a  channel named by the pair confirm  for an outgoing communication  and conﬁrm  for an incoming communication . They may be thought of as ports of a virtual connection. Note that communications are always directed.  Consider this short example:  TravelBusiness := TravelAgency  Traveler  TravelAgency := request . offer . book . confirm . 0  Traveler := request . offer . book . confirm . 0  The process system named TravelBusiness includes the two parallel pro- cesses TravelAgency and Traveler from Figure 5.4. Each of these processes is described by a process term. The dot indicates the sequence  i.e., the ﬂow  of  communicational  steps  of  single  processes .  The  sequence  of performing  communications  leads  to  what  is  understood  as  process evolvement.  Roughly  speaking,  when  a  process  comes  to  a  receiving communication in its process term, it blocks until the communication is performed; that is, it is triggered by receiving the handshake communi- cation via the channel in question. It then evolves to the next state. So, having  performed  a  handshake  communication,  both  process  terms evolve to the next step. This is close to state transitions in automata, but  Process terms  Process evolvement  confirm  Travel Agency  Traveler  confirm  Figure 5.4 Communication channel between processes.   208  Chapter 5 Modeling Processes  Nondeterminism  not necessarily ﬁnite or deterministic. By the way, the “.0” indicates the evolvement toward the termination of the process. It may be left off for abbreviation.  Since more than two processes can use the same channel, with pre- cisely the same name, nondeterminism can be expressed. Consider again the following simpliﬁed example for our travel business  see also Figure 5.5 :  TravelBusiness := TravelAgency1  TravelAgency2   Traveler  TravelAgency1 := request . offer . book . conﬁrm  TravelAgency2 := request . offer . book . conﬁrm  Traveler := request . request . offer . book . conﬁrm  Y  F L  M  Here we do not know how the process system evolves  i.e., which of the travel agencies wins the race with its offer . In this simple example both travel agencies are identical, and both receive the traveler’s request  probably sent to both by request.request  and make an offer. The trav- eler will book at only one agency. The “losing” agency will block at the  A  E  T  confirm  Travel Agency1  offer  request  book  request  book  Travel Agency2  offer  confirm  Figure 5.5 Nondeterminism in process systems.  Team-Fly®  offer  request  book  offer  Traveler  confirm   5.2 Business Process Modeling and Systems Development  209  Mobility  book step. By the way, we also do not know which agency receives the request ﬁrst. Although this example is rather simple, it shows that the π- calculus provides us with mechanisms to model real world situations that cannot be clearly expressed at modeling time. Our example leaves totally open which travel agency the traveler will get a ticket from after all.  Mobility  is  one  mode  of  evolvement  given  by  means  of  communi- cation links  or channels  that die or are dynamically created during the lifetime of the process system. So we can describe the fact that a commu- nication channel is moved from one component of a process system  or “agent” in our terminology  to another. The set of communication links of an agent describes its neighborhood and, as a consequence, its loca- tion. Then we can also move the agent itself by moving its communica- tion links and thereby creating a new location.  In our previous example we can think of the situation where the travel agency cannot handle a request in time and therefore delegates the task of preparing an offer to its subagency  see Figure 5.6 . For that purpose a new  channel  reply is  established  that  is  moved  via  names  offer1 and offer2 from TravelAgency1 to TravelAgency2  indicated  by  the  block arrow . The reply channel functions as a process handle that is passed along  to  TravelAgency2.  By  that  mechanism,  TravelAgency2 is  able  to send  its  offer  to Traveler although  it  does  not  even  directly  know  the  delegate  offer2  Travel Agency2  offer1  book  delegate  request  Travel Agency1  confirm  Figure 5.6 Mobility in process systems.  reply  Traveler  book  request  confirm   210  Chapter 5 Modeling Processes  π-calculus- based business processes  Business process representation  reply channel. TravelAgency2 just works out the offer; booking and con- ﬁrmation in our example are dealt with by TravelAgency1 and Traveler.  The π-calculus notation of this example is as follows:  TravelBusiness := TravelAgency1  TravelAgency2   TravelAgency1 := request offer1  . delegate  .  Traveler  book . conﬁrm  TravelAgency2 := delegate offer2  . offer2  Traveler :=  new reply request  . reply .  book . conﬁrm  We  will  now  incorporate  the  features  sketched  so  far  into  a  model- ing approach. Modeling based on π-calculus means viewing a business process as a system of what we will call “π-processes,” processing concur- rently, in parallel. A b-process is performed  1  by the interaction of such π-processes  this interaction is externally observable  and  2  by activities internal to these π-processes.  So,  a  business  process  is  actually  represented  on  two  layers:   1   the interaction layer and  2  the elementary task layer. At ﬁrst sight, this does not seem to differ so much from the workﬂow model, but in fact it does so signiﬁcantly: In the π-processes system, there is no globally imposed scheduler,  and  no  predeﬁned  network  of  interaction  ﬂow.  The  inter- action structure of a “π-system” emerges as its π-processes evolve, that is, as  single  π-processes  proceed   advance  their  state   by  communicating with  other  π-processes.  This  means  a  decentralized  control  structure, organized by cooperation. As long as mobility is neglected, a structure of possible communication channels can be determined a priori for a π-sys- tem by examining the individual structures of the π-processes, that is, by looking up which “front ends” or “back ends” of channels appear within a  term   expression   deﬁning  a  π-process.  An  instance  of  π-calculus communication, as stated earlier, is directed and a singular event, mean- ing, loosely speaking, a channel is one-way and used at most once. But since concurrent π-processes can compete simultaneously for the same channel, it is often impossible to predetermine who will win and which communication will take place. Similarly, within a π-process, the evolu- tion  path  can  branch,  and  it  is  often  not  possible  to  decide  locally  in advance which path will be taken. We will come back later to these kinds of nondeterminism.   5.2 Business Process Modeling and Systems Development  211  Mobility now adds the creation of new channels “on the ﬂy,” estab- lishing new front or back ends, or both. This way “process handles” can be passed along, which is logically equivalent to moving processes. This feature, which we explained earlier, is quite useful and is applicable to diverse cases of real world modeling. Milner gives the technical example of a mobile phone in a car that must disconnect from, and reconnect to, transmitters as it is moved over cell boundaries. Here “mobility” is the movement of the cellular phone’s link to another transmitter rather than the movement of the phone as the car is moving. Typical business pro- cess examples could include the following:    Servicing moving clients, such as travelers or customers in big shop- ping centers, with special information  e.g., pertaining to places, pos- sible activities, possible contacts, etc.     Maintaining  or  offering  service  relations  when  customers   people  as well as companies  move their site of operation  e.g., by shifting ser- vices for relocated customers to another branch of a bank     Introducing people or entire units into organizations and business net- works  and  helping  them  within  such  environments   e.g.,  initiating new employees in the processes of their departments and of the whole company, or guiding and supporting students at universities, or pro- viding citizens with communal and other public services     Accompanying a product life cycle, for material products as well as for service products  e.g., as offered by banks , especially when different phases of a product life cycle necessitate different services  Rather than just treating the symptoms, inadequacies in the workﬂow view are remedied to a large extent only if a business process model is built around the concepts of communication, parallelism, nondetermin- ism, and mobility, derived from π-calculus. With these concepts, the real- ity  of  an  enterprise  or  organization  can  be  modeled  much  more  ade- quately. Such a model prominently features agents:  1. Agents  cooperate  actively  to  reach  the  goals  set  for  a  business  process.  2. Agents work concurrently and interactively. 3. Agents know who is the expert for a particular job step, or who rou-  tinely performs particular tasks.  4. Agents communicate with each other about orders or completion reports of orders, information, and availability of material or  inter- mediate  products.  Agent-oriented aspects   212  Chapter 5 Modeling Processes  5. In certain situations, agents decide for themselves what to do next  or whom to ask for help with a task.  6. In special problem situations, agents try to ﬁnd somebody who can  help or who knows whom to consult for help.  7. In the case of new goals, agents may accept new duties and establish new communication links in order to react ﬂexibly to a changing world.  The concept of communication accounts substantially for items 1, 2, 3, and 4; parallelism, for items 1 and 2; nondeterminism, for item 5; and mobility for items 6 and 7, in this very incomplete list of cooperation aspects.  Nondeterminism is certainly not a desirable feature for an IT system speciﬁcation, but it is a requisite for modeling business processes—cer- tainly  in  service-oriented  business  sectors  and  probably  also  generally. Nondeterminism can be understood as modeling the fact that the mod- eler either does not have  or does not want to spend the effort to supply  enough information to always exactly determine a process evolvement  i.e., to exactly differentiate between the conditions for each individual path  of  a  branch   has  no  way  to  determine  beforehand  which  one  of equally  possible  communications  within  a  system  of  parallel  processes may succeed. Such situations are more likely to occur the more concur- rency  exists  in  the  system  realizing  a  business  process.  Thus,  to  model  some  business processes really precisely and in detail requires the delib- erate introduction of nondeterminism into the model.  Moreover, nondeterminism in a business process model reﬂects a high degree of decentralized control in the performance of this business pro- cess.  To  describe  the  organization  of  this  kind  of  decentralized  control  i.e., cooperation , an additional concept is needed—contracts. A contract speciﬁes how a provider services a client, where both service consumer and service supplier are peers. This distinguishes contracts from orders or commands in a traditionally viewed organization and identiﬁes them as a means of modeling cooperation and delegation, rather than hierarchical function decomposition. Obviously, this distinction also corresponds to the  view  of  a  business  process  as  “stretching  horizontally”  through  an enterprise as opposed to “climbing up and down” a Tayloristically struc- tured organization hierarchy.  So the previous enumeration of features to be modeled for agents ac- cording  to  the  new  view  has  to  be  complemented  with  the  feature  of contracting. The contracting ability of an agent means that the agent is authorized to negotiate the way he or she produces and delivers a result,  Nondeterminism  Contracts  Contracting agents   5.2 Business Process Modeling and Systems Development  213  or to decide to responsibly employ the help of other agents for a partial process. In such a way, a cascade of contracts may be found in an ade- quate business process model.  An additional notion has proved helpful: we denote what agents con- tribute to a certain business process as the role they play in that business process. This abstraction allows us to make clear that the same agent may, probably at different times, be part of different business processes, play- ing different roles. The notion of roles also allows us to describe a busi- ness process without naming concrete people or IT systems.  The  main  reason  for  obtaining  more  adequate  business  processing models is to make a shift in the perception of business—the shift from a view of structured activities to a view of communicating agents, actively cooperating to achieve common goals, and with a contracting ability of their own. This is roughly expressed by the slogan that calls for a transi- tion from “process-driven people” toward “people-driven processes,” or more generally toward “agent-driven processes.”  This “shifted view” is actually a view dual with the traditional way of viewing  business  processes:  instead  of  focusing  on  activities  and  their sequence,  the  dualistic  view  entails  focusing  on  roles  that  agents  play, and  on  their  interaction,  structuring,  and  organizing  of  the  b-process “from the inside”  i.e., by cooperation  instead of being ﬁxed into a rigid structure controlled from the outside.  Some interesting points can be made with regard to this dualism: The basic  elements  of  the  workﬂow  concept,  events  and   complex   activi- ties—corresponding respectively to states and transitions  e.g., as known from  Petri  Nets —are  purely  abstract  entities.  The  new  basic  elements, agents  as players of roles  and communications, however, can be directly observed.  In a workﬂow, agents do not initially appear, although they may ap- pear in a workﬂow conﬁguration as actors assigned to activities. So, com- paring workﬂow conﬁgurations with our b-processes, we might assert the following correspondence:   Agent  in a role, π-process  ↔ actor  assigned to activity    Communication ↔ event   Internal task ↔ elementary activity  The sore point of this correspondence is the comparison of “commu- nication” and “event.” There is an additional convention needed, some- thing like “An event as a result of an activity performed by actor X shall be  understood  as  a  sending  communication  by  an  agent  in  role  X;  an event  starting  an  activity  performed  by  actor  Y  shall  correspond  to  a  Shift toward agent-driven processes  Dualistic view of processes  Mapping dualistic concepts   214  Chapter 5 Modeling Processes  receiving communication by role Y.” Whether this actually works gener- ally is not yet clear.  This  “dualistic  transformation”  is  trivialized  if  we  ﬁrst  apply  a dimension-reducing projection from the new onto the old view’s “space”: if nondeterminism and mobility are completely removed, and parallel- ism partly, from the new view, what is left over can easily be transformed into a workﬂow  conﬁguration .  The  last  point,  the  conditionally  possible  “projection”  from  the “space” of the new view onto that of the old one, is another way of say- ing that the new view encompasses the old. In other words, the conven- tional workﬂow view is just a special case of the new view of business process engineering.  5.2.4 A Business-Centered Modeling Approach  Enterprise modeling may have several goals. So far we have focused on business process modeling. Its basic goal from the IT perspective is to ana- lyze the behavior of an organization and get a summary of the informa- tion  demands.  Data  modeling  is  much  more  technology  centered  and  Modeling, Administration, and Manipulation Tools  Presentation  Model Schemas  Transformation and Refinement Rules  Rule Base  Representation  Model and Business Databases  Data Management  Figure 5.7 Elements of the model-building procedure for process design.   5.2 Business Process Modeling and Systems Development  215  Business- centered method  deals with the identiﬁcation of structural elements and relationships to be mapped into the IT world.  Basic elements of a business-centered view of process modeling can be  divided into three tiers, as shown in Figure 5.7.  The  main  layer  is  the  representation  of  model  information  on  the metalevel. Here the model schemas are given for several methodological views:    The business domain model, representing the business structure   The  contract  model,  deﬁning  the  parameters  of  collaborative  value    The process model, deﬁning the behavioral aspects in process systems   The valuation model, representing all task-oriented information   The allocation model, linking physical to virtual entities in the overall  creation  model.  Figure 5.8 shows an ERM of a sample metamodel representing the busi- ness domain information.

This approach heads in a rule-based direction.  5.2.5 Process Design and Object Orientation After all, why not use OO modeling for adequate BPE? You could employ UML diagrams to visualize facts contained in a model according to the new view. For example, UML collaboration diagrams  Fowler and Scott 1997  are handy for presenting the interaction structure of roles, display- ing the roles as object symbols and the channels  i.e., the possible com- munications  as message arrows. That is, we are using UML constructs in a very special way. When showing such a diagram to someone familiar with UML, we have to point out this reinterpretation in order to avoid misunderstanding.  The trouble is that the OO approach is a solution only on the technical level, on the software level, not on the BPE level. This is a signiﬁcant dif- ference: a business process is not just another view of an IT systems land- scape;  a  business  process  encompasses  IT  support  but  comprises  much more than the IT side. Especially in the service businesses, we may see business processes only very sparingly supported by IT. An OO model is, in the ﬁrst place, a model of some software system or, in other words, a technical  speciﬁcation  of  some  software.  A  business  process  model  de- scribes  the  business  domain  ideally  without  any  IT  aspects  in  mind, which is certainly not the case in workﬂow modeling.  Nonetheless, business process modeling and OO modeling are related:    In forward business process engineering, one of the results of building a business process model and of its evaluation can be a speciﬁcation of an OO model—a speciﬁcation of a speciﬁcation of some software.    In  business  process  reengineering  and  reverse  engineering,  an  OO model is an important input for  re- constructing the business process model.  Reinterpretation of UML diagrams  Inadequacy of OO  Relation between OO and process modeling  5.3 COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION:  TOWARD AGENT-BASED SYSTEMS  Management of communication  In the previous section we argued for a paradigm shift in regarding and dealing with business processes in today’s organizations, by replacing the management of structures with a management of communication. Com-   5.3 Communication and Cooperation: Toward Agent-Based Systems  217  plex business transactions take place in highly dynamic cooperative net- works rather than rigid sequences of production steps vertically or hori- zontally placed along the so-called value chain  Porter 1998 .  Agent-oriented technologies have become of increasing interest for the design  and  development  of  software  systems.  There  are  high  expecta- tions: “the next signiﬁcant breakthrough in software development” and “the new revolution in software”  Jennings and Woolridge 1998 . In turn, huge market opportunities with billions of dollars of revenues are fore- seen  Guilfoyle 1998 . Since agent technologies are discussed in various contexts, we ﬁrst give a short overview.  5.3.1 The Notion of Agent-Based Systems  Agents, or software agents, were originally part of artiﬁcial intelligence  AI  research work. Thus many concepts in the ﬁeld of multiagents sys- tems are closely related to AI concepts. Instead of contributing to the dis- cussion about what an agent really is  for a discussion of that topic, see Müller and Jennings 1997 , we will summarize several aspects as being basic attributes of agents.   Figure 5.9 gives an overview of agent attributes. Reactivity is the ability of an agent to perceive information from its environment and perform an action accordingly. It may have either sensors for that purpose or an internal model of its environmental system  deliberative agent . Depend- ing on its goals, an agent may also be self-induced and perform actions that  may  inﬂuence  its  environment   goal  orientation  and  proactivity . The ability to learn implies the ability to deduce from its observations and adapt accordingly. Here we ﬁnd AI concepts such as knowledge or rule bases.  Autonomy is one of the most important aspects that makes agent tech- nology interesting for software development. Agents perform their tasks autonomously in the sense that interaction with a controlling entity such as  a  human  user  is  not  needed—or,  if  so,  only  to  a  small  degree.  To achieve its goals an agent may move among nodes within a communica- tion  network   mobility   to  reduce  the  communication  overhead.  Such migration approaches are known from distributed computing.  Another  essential  attribute  is  communication—interaction  both  with human users and with other agents. The latter case requires the existence of agent languages with appropriate protocols  a subject of later discus- sion . Communication also serves to coordinate agents performing com- plex tasks cooperatively. Thus cooperation is only possible if agents can communicate with each other.

Attributes such as autonomy, communication, reactivity, and proactiv- ity are commonly considered essential for agents. From the perspective of AI, mental attributes may be added, such as knowledge; belief, desire, and intention; emotion; and creativity. Mobility is usually considered to be optional.  5.3.2 Typology and Applications of Agents  The attributes discussed in the previous subsection may serve as classiﬁ- cation factors for agents, leading to the typology shown in Figure 5.10. This is just a sampling of the approaches observable in the ﬁeld of agent- based research and applications. This classiﬁcation allows for combina- tion;  for  example,  we  may  ﬁnd  applications  of  smart,  collaborative, mobile agents  Franklin and Graesser 1997 .  Team-Fly®   5.3 Communication and Cooperation: Toward Agent-Based Systems  219  Typology of  Agents  Collaborative  Agents  Mobile Agents  Reactive Agents  Heterogeneous Agent Systems  Interface Agents  Information  Agents  Hybrid Agents  Smart Agents  Figure 5.10 A typology of agent concepts.  The concept of agents has been given a great push by the Internet. The shift  toward  information  processing  in  changing  networked  environ- ments  has  led  to  the  problem  of  efﬁciency  in  dealing  with  increasing amounts of information. So the class of interface and information agents has  become  of  particular  interest—for  example,  robots  that  preselect information  from  mailboxes,  lists,  and  similar  resources,  or  personal assistants that help to ﬁnd resources on the Web.  Much  of  the  research  in  the  ﬁeld  of  interface  agents  has  been  done at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT . We will mention just some of the applications developed there. Prominent examples are Cal- endar Agent, for the management of appointments  Kozierok and Maes 1993 ; NewT, to train agents for news selection  Maes 1994 ; and Kasbah, an  agent-based  marketplace  for  music  titles   Chavez  and  Maes  1996 . Currently  we  face  a  new  wave  in  personal  assistance  in  Web-based applications.  Constructed  with  3D  modeling  techniques,  these  agents have a human appearance and interact with users through natural speech interfaces.  Another  class  is  given  by  the  more  general  concept  of  collaborative agents—autonomous software units that perform tasks on behalf of a sin- gle user or a group of users. Autonomy, as stated earlier, means that an agent decides on the basis of its own  e.g., rule-based  knowledge. Agents  Internet agents  Collaborative agents   220  Chapter 5 Modeling Processes  Agent systems  Agent communication  may be mobile—they may move within a computer network to get their jobs done and return with the result.  Since tasks may be diversiﬁed, agents may also be grouped into agent systems to perform complex tasks. If agents of several types are grouped, we may consider the result a heterogeneous  multi- agent system.  There are further categories and applications of agents that we will not discuss here but that are documented in a variety of publications: docu- ment  retrieval,  air  trafﬁc  control,  management  of  telecommunication networks, computer integrated manufacturing, medical care systems, and many more.  The large number of agent-based approaches demonstrates that agent- oriented  computing  is  a  viable  technical  solution  for  mapping  certain classes of complex systems to the IT world. In particular, to come back to our original problem, this is true for the support of business processes, from conceptual modeling to implementation, via computer-based tech- niques and systems.  5.3.3 Agent-Oriented Concepts  An essential concept of agents is communication, which builds the basis for  the “social” capabilities of agents. This implies that agents interact on the  basis  of  an  agent  communication  language.  ACL  is  an  example  of such a language. ACL has three components: a vocabulary, the outer lan- guage  KIF   Knowledge  Interchange  Format ,  and  the  inner  language KQML  Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language .  Agent communication is performed by message passing. ACL messages are expressions that are deﬁned using the KQML. These expressions con- sist of terms and sentences in accordance with the vocabulary, which is context speciﬁc and deﬁned in an extensible dictionary.  A KQML message is abstract; that is, it is independent from its content, which is just one component of the KQML message itself. The vocabulary is  often  referred  to  as  the  “information  model”  or  the  “ontology.”  A receiver has to understand the ontology to be able to process the message on the semantic level. Ontologies were discussed in Section 4.2  see also Uschold and Gruninger 1996 . On the message-passing level, speech acts are deﬁned. Since speech acts will be discussed later in Section 6.4, we will just outline the idea here.  Messages  are  of  a  certain  speech  act  type.  A  concrete  instance  of  a speech act type is called a performative. Several types are deﬁned, such as tell to transmit a message, ask-one to check for a fact, or broker-one to   5.3 Communication and Cooperation: Toward Agent-Based Systems  221  delegate the execution of a speech act  Finin et al. 1993 . Here is an exam- ple that asks for a stock rate  Mayﬁeld, Labrou, and Finin 1996 :      :content   PRICE IBM ?price   :receiver stock-server  :language LPPROLOG  :ontology NYSE-TICKS     The speech act or statement deﬁned in the content ﬁeld is based on what has been deﬁned within the language ﬁeld. The general structure of a performative thus is ﬁxed by the given ﬁelds. Finally, to give an impres- sion of the relevant aspects and complexity, Figure 5.11 shows the overall structure of language concepts in the ﬁeld of agent technology.  Many types of agents in a variety of applications rely on cooperation to perform their tasks. So far we have said nothing about how the neces- sary exchange of services is coordinated. At least two types of communi- cation can be identiﬁed: deliberative and negotiation.  An  example  of  negotiation-based  agent  coordination  is  the  contract net approach  Dauts and Smith 1983 . Services are exchanged according to service level agreements  SLAs  that have been negotiated among the participants. These SLAs may be considered as contracts in the sense of our notion of business processes discussed earlier.  A contract net speciﬁes a network of nodes given by agents that act according  to  market  mechanisms.  In  multiagent  systems,  special  man- agers are usually implemented and provided with the necessary knowl- edge to tender services. Processors then supervise the contract building.  Alternatively, auction-based mechanisms have been proposed for the coordination of service exchange. We will not discuss the economic im- plications  of  negotiation  and  auctions  in  detail,  but  we  will  just  state that auctions give much more transparency to the market and therefore promise more efﬁciency in resource allocation.  Additionally  the  conditions  are  commonly  known  in  advance.  This reduces the complexity for modeling the realization of appropriate mech- anisms in agent systems. The appropriate strategies differ from type to type since we may deal with the English, the Dutch, or Vickrey auction, to mention just a few. Some parameters are still up to the single partici- pant to deﬁne.

Agent architectures  The question of how to communicate and coordinate in agent systems is  answered  by  architectures.  Architectures  support  the  organization  of the  cooperation  within  multiagent  systems   Genesereth  and  Ketchpel 1994 .  From  the  perspective  of  communication,  there  are  two  cases:  1  directly  i.e., bi- or multilaterally by broadcast mechanisms or speciﬁc channels  and  2  supported  i.e., via special components that pass the messages from a sender forward to the receiver .   5.3 Communication and Cooperation: Toward Agent-Based Systems  223  In the ﬁrst case, either service requests or service proﬁles  speciﬁcation sharing  are sent. On that basis receivers can act according to their goals and  answer   react   appropriately.  In  the  second  case,  services  are  nor- mally  registered  in  central  directories  or  knowledge  containers  of  the coordinating entities, and the sender does not need to know the receiver. Such entities are called facilitators in federated systems that speciﬁcally support agent coordination. Agents delegate some of their autonomy to the  facilitator,  which  acts  on  their  behalf  by  sending  messages  on  the basis of general information and requirements about its clients.  Agent  architectures  aim  at  abstracting  from  proprietary  approaches and providing a conceptual framework for the design and development of  agent  systems.  Examples  of  architectures  are  InteRRaP,  GRATE,  and ADEPT. ADEPT is the topic of the following subsection.  5.3.4 ADEPT  An architecture of particular interest is the Advanced Decision Environ- ment  for  Process  Tasks   ADEPT .  It  aims  to  support  business  processes with agent-based IT solutions. ADEPT has been a research project under the participation of British Telecom. Its basic results and concepts will be outlined here  for more details, see Norman et al. 1996 and Jennings et al. 1996 .  ADEPT allows the mapping of simple or complex organizational units to an agency. Agencies deliberately provide services to and or request ser- vices from other agencies. An agency can be thought of as executing part of  a  business  process  that  may  have  been  modeled  conceptually  as  a result of a business process reengineering project.  An agency may encompass other agencies or agents. The responsible agent controls its agency, coordinates its services, and represents them to the rest of the system world. From an organizational perspective, it could be  considered  the  head  of  a  department,  with  the  agency  being  the department. According to our earlier arguments, we will not consider the allocation of real world objects to conceptual elements in detail.  Figure 5.12 shows the logical structure deﬁned by ADEPT. Agency Y consists of agencies E, F, and G and the responsible agent. TD1, TD2, TE1, and TE2 are atomic tasks to be performed by agents, that is, by the re- sponsible  agent  and  in  turn  by  so-called  subsidiary  agents  within  the agency.  In  agency  E  we  have  zoomed  into  the  responsible  agent,  which encompasses ﬁve logical and functional components.

The acquaintance model  AM  encapsulates knowledge about other agents, including their capabilities and a history of service requests. The execution schedule is maintained by the situation assessment module  SAM . For that purpose it needs sev- eral types of information, such as requests by other agents, services that it has already agreed upon, and service- as well as negotiation-oriented information.  The  service  execution  module   SEM   initializes  and  manages  the services  that  the  agent  has  committed  to  provide.  It  also  requests  ser- vices required from other agents. The interaction management module   5.3 Communication and Cooperation: Toward Agent-Based Systems  225   IMM  represents the interests of an agent in the negotiation procedures. It is triggered by the SAM.  The exchange of information and services is based on communication performed among the communication modules. They pack messages and pass  them  toward  the  receiving  agent.  On  the  implementation  level, CORBA services  i.e., the object request broker  may be employed for that purpose.  The communication protocol in ADEPT is based on speech acts that express the intent of an agent. The content may be coded in KIF syntax; the semantics are given by the ontology, as we outlined in the previous subsection.  So  the  structure  of  a  message  follows  the  KQML  approach. Some  examples  of  negotiation-oriented  actions  are  propose, counter- propose, accept, reject, conﬁrm,  and  deny.  The  basic  structure  is  the following:  CORBA-based communication  ADEPT speech acts   message   action:   sender:           recipient:       conversation:      service:        info-model:       content:         The CM not only manages the logical distribution of messages, but it also  encodes  and  decodes  the  content  according  to  the  language.  This allows agents that “speak” different languages to communicate with each other, as long as the CM has access to the necessary information in the AM.  We will not discuss the outcome of the project in detail, but we should mention  that  ADEPT  has  been  applied  to  some  business  processes  at British Telecom  BT , for example, the Provide Customer Quote Service  see www.mmrg.ecs.soton.ac.uk nrj projects paam96 paam2.html .  Research on  collaborative  agents  at  BT  laboratories  has  resulted  in  the  devel- opment  of  the  agent-building  tool  kit  ZEUS   www.labs.bt.com projects  agents.htm .   226  Chapter 5 Modeling Processes  5.4 PROCESS CONCEPTS AND XML  So far we have put a lot of effort into describing our notion of business processes, the necessary paradigm shift for adequate process modeling, and agent-oriented techniques to support business process modeling and execution. Now we will ﬁnally give some hints as to what the contribu- tion  of  XML  to  these  topics  might  be.  Since  this  is  a  ﬁeld  of  ongoing research and practical work, the purpose of some of the statements made in this section is more to give an idea than to present the solution.  5.4.1 Actor-Driven Processes The heading of this subsection generalizes to a certain extent what we stated  earlier:  a  paradigm  shift  from  process-driven  people  to  people- driven  processes.  We  have  to  overcome  conceptual  and  implementa- tional patterns that have been well elaborated in assembly line industrial production.  Instead we have to consider active and collaborative entities, whether we  call  them  “agents,”  “actors,”  or  whatever.  These  entities  contribute to value creation, which is the goal of a business process, assuming they have a common understanding of the process or business domain or at least compatible targets.  Since  collaboration  requires  interaction,  communication  is  a  main attribute of such considerations. We ﬁrst discuss a special aspect of com- munication in the next subsection. This is followed by a discussion of contracts, another important feature, that aims at specifying the condi- tions of value creation steps between collaborating entities.  5.4.2 Open Communication Processes The design and implementation of IT systems will lead to much better results if designers and system architects understand the business domain that is supposed to be supported by IT solutions. Business process analy- sis  and  modeling  may  be  a  helpful  approach  to  gaining  the  necessary information.  In larger business contexts, processes do not perform without interact- ing  with  their  environment.  In  particular,  they  exchange  information and work pieces with other processes. So, instead of dealing with single isolated processes, we deal with systems of interacting processes, inter- action performed by communication.  Communication in the real world as well as in computer systems is the common means of exchanging information and or services among sev-  Interaction   5.4 Process Concepts and XML  227  eral entities. In informatics the concept is used in a variety of approaches, for example, client-server architectures in general, or CORBA to mention just one in particular. Agent-based systems seem especially promising at this point.  But there are still some unanswered questions. In the context of com- munication,  the  feature  of  dynamics  encompasses  the  possibility  of changing  communication  channels  between  interacting  entities  or— what is even worse—entities may migrate, disappear, or appear arbitrarily. In a real world business, think of a service unit or a whole department that moves to another location, has been closed, or is newly established. These events lead to changes in the communication structure of the pro- cess system.  Although migration or closing down could be handled by communi- cating the new contact information to the known partners in advance, the  problem  of  communicating  with  unknown  entities  still  has  to  be solved. There are two possible situations:  1  a process seeks another pro- cess  e.g., for the reason of collaborating or exchanging services , or  2  a new process has been established and it needs to integrate with a process system “at runtime.”  These two situations share a common problem: how can a process ﬁnd other processes to get its job done? First, the processes must be a proper ﬁt for one another in terms of offering the required services. Second, they must have compatible interfaces. And third, a mechanism must exist to publish this information.  The ﬁrst two requirements are answered by mechanisms that may be implemented using XML-based technologies and incorporating concepts from  other  ﬁelds  such  as  agent  communication  languages.  The  third requirement, however, is a lot more difﬁcult without central mechanisms such  as  directories  or  broker  services.  The  third  requirement  is,  at  the same time, the most interesting since in real world systems we often ﬁnd many chaotic aspects that do not rely on ﬁxed structures or predeﬁned knowledge of “how to do something.” On the other hand, we often ﬁnd lots of business cases where centralized mechanisms make sense.  Bi- or multilateral communication between agents usually is session oriented. Sessions can only be established if agents are able to identify each other. Centralized  i.e., broker-based  communication is commonly realized via message passing. Message passing is the mechanism of choice in many communication-oriented services and protocols, such as CORBA in  object-oriented  systems  and  KQML KIF  in  the  context  of  agent technologies.  Dynamic adaptation  Anonymous communication  Message passing   228  Chapter 5 Modeling Processes  Broadcasting  For  “anonymous”  publishing  mechanisms   i.e.,  the  sender  does  not know the receiver s  , our ﬁrst thought would be a broadcast service that provides an infrastructure that messages can be pushed at. A potential receiver would have to actively and deliberatively poll over such a public message queue.  TPA contract  TPA layers  5.4.3 Contract-Based Interaction with tpaML  A  E  tpaML  Trading Partners Agreement Modeling Language  is a markup lan- guage speciﬁcation proposed by IBM. It has been integrated with IBM’s B2B  e-commerce  products,  particularly  the  WebSphere  B2B  Integrator, which has been built on top of the WebSphere Commerce Suite.  The basic idea is to set up an electronic contract  TPA  on the basis of XML. A TPA deﬁnes how trading partners interact on several layers. In particular,  it  deﬁnes  contract  terms  and  conditions,  participant  roles, identiﬁcation,  communication  properties,  security  properties,  actions, sequencing rules, and error handling or recovery procedures  Sachs et al. 2000; Ennser et al. 2000 .  M  F L  Y  T  The language to stipulate all this information is tpaML. The resulting contracts are enforced by the integration software that controls the busi- ness transactions of two partners over the Internet.  There  are  three  concrete  layers  for  TPAs.  First,  the  business  protocol layer is the interface between the business application functions and the TPA-deﬁned  actions.  It  provides  rules  for  sequencing  the  messages between servicing parties. Second, the document exchange layer provides abstracting services for document handling between the business proto- col and transport layers, including time-stamping, logging, auditing, and nonrepudiation. Finally, the transport layer delivers messages according to the selected communication protocol, including security aspects.  A TPA is an XML document described by a DTD or schema. From this description the document code is generated on the computer systems of the trading partners that agreed on the TPA. The following is the basic structure of a TPA as a snippet of XML, enriched by some additional tags in the transport section:       <!-- Preamble: TPAname, role, deﬁnitions,   participants, etc. -->         Team-Fly®   5.4 Process Concepts and XML  229      version              …        …    <!-- communication and transport security  information -->                             Such  a  TPA  has  to  be  set  up  and  then  agreed  upon  by  the  partners. Then  code  is  generated  on  either  side,  including  the  local  registration information and the code necessary to enforce the corresponding rules of interaction.  5.4.4 Self-Modifying Processes  The attribute of self-modiﬁcation comes into play for adaptations of busi- ness  entities  due  to  environmental  changes.  Change  management is  a structured procedure for performing all necessary organizational transfor- mations that keep an enterprise competitive. Usually short-term changes are considered that are supposed to meet current client demands, techno- logical innovations, political or economic circumstances, and so on.  Additionally we may also consider long-term changes that inﬂuence “long  transactions,”  using  an  IT-related  term.  As  an  example,  we  can think of a process that manages all activities related to the ﬁnancial de- mands  of  a  customer.  The  process  then  covers  the  “life  cycle”  of  the  Short-term changes  Long-term changes   230  Chapter 5 Modeling Processes  customer. At some point a bank account is needed, then some life insur- ance, followed by some investments, a mortgage, asset management, and so on.  Changing processes on the conceptual level leads to changing process implementations on the ﬂy or at runtime. This is done by replacing some implementations by other implementations. Therefore mechanisms are needed that allow the generation of process instances. This is what we consider a metalevel problem.  Minor changes in processes may be dealt with by parameterization. For example, an audit mechanism could control processes by tuning them with  appropriate  parameter  values.  The  behavior  of  processes  may  be dealt with on the implementation level as well, for instance, through arti- ﬁcial intelligence such as rule-based mechanisms. Structural changes in processes, however, must be considered on the metalevel.  A metamodel describes a process or a class of processes  i.e., its struc- ture,  the  relationship  of  its  components,  and  its  behavior .  From  that description an instance of a process may be derived, including appropri- ate real world allocations for process objects. The π-calculus  see Section 5.2.2  provides the modeler with an advanced means to anticipate certain types of changes, mainly through the mobility feature.  A solution on the conceptual level implies having formal transforma- tion  mechanisms  for  forward  and  reverse  engineering  that  allow  the incorporation of changes at the implementation site backward into the corresponding model views and, in turn, the generation of appropriate process instances from changed metamodels.  Since the support for such a task through formal means is still an open research  ﬁeld,  automated  adaptation  and  self-modiﬁcation  are  a  future result.  Nonetheless  the  BPMI,  presented  next,  claims  to  enable  process implementations to change across systems, over time, and dynamically in response to changing conditions.  5.4.5 The Business Process Management Initiative  BPMI   The Business Process Management Initiative  www.bpmi.org  aims at pro- moting and developing standards for the design, deployment, execution, maintenance, and optimization of business processes, particularly collab- orative  processes  in  electronic  business.  Two  open  speciﬁcations  have been deﬁned, the Business Process Modeling Language  BPML  and the Business Process Query Language  BPQL .  Metamodels  BPML and BPQL   5.4 Process Concepts and XML  231  A business process describes some transaction, based on a ﬁnite-state machine, between two business partners. Interaction takes place through a common  i.e., public  interface, supporting the exchange of informa- tion among the private process implementations. The private implemen- tations  are  considered  to  be  participants  in  the  process.  The  public interface may be supported by common protocols such as ebXML, to be discussed in Section 10.3.  Although  the  private  implementations  could  be  speciﬁed  using  the BPML, the execution of business processes is supported using the BPQL. Figure 5.13 presents an architectural overview of the scope of BPMI.  Similarly to XML, which describes data on the metalevel, the BPML al- lows the modeling of business processes on the metalevel and indepen- dently  of  any  existing  back-ofﬁce  system  or  protocol.  The  schema  for BPML can be thought of as building the basis for the speciﬁcation of pro- cesses in a speciﬁc business process modeling language. BPML representa- tions  encompass  control,  data,  and  event  ﬂows  as  well  as  support  for deﬁning business rules, security roles, and transaction contexts.

Here is  a  short  excerpt  from  the  BPML  XML  Schema,  deﬁning  the  process element:           Process definition                                      Process integration  The complex type process definition encompasses metadata for ad- vertising, searching and categorizing, rule sets to express conditions and dependencies, complex activities representing ﬂows of control, and sim- ple  activities  to  perform  data  processing,  communication,  and  system operations or actions. These entities again are deﬁned in further detail by the schema deﬁnition.  As stated earlier, the BPMI speciﬁcations deal with processes in elec- tronic  businesses.  They  aim  at  process  integration  in  intra-  and  inter- enterprise computing. Therefore distributed transactions  synchronous as well as asynchronous  are supported that allow the embedding of appli- cations within business processes. Process integration with BPML refers to the following targets:    Integrating applications as process components   Interleaving processes and transactions   5.4 Process Concepts and XML  233    Process  model  exchange  between  business  process  management  systems  The  BPQL  is  an  interface  to  the  execution-oriented  components  of process  management  infrastructures.  Such  infrastructures  typically  en- compass  a  component  that  controls  the  execution  of  processes   i.e.,  a process server , which may be compared to a workﬂow engine. Addition- ally a component is available to hold data such as process descriptions and related information  i.e., a process repository .  The execution of process instances can be controlled through an inter- face  based  on  SOAP   see  Section  6.5.2 .  The  repository  can  be  queried through an interface based on WebDAV, a set of HTTP extensions to col- laboratively edit and manage ﬁles on remote Web servers  www.webdav .org .  Process  models  managed  by  the  process  repository  through  the BPQL interface can be exposed as UDDI  Section 7.3  services for process registration, advertising, and discovery purposes.  5.4.6 Business Rules  Business rules contain business knowledge that describes the parameters  i.e.,  policies  and  procedures   of  transactions  and  work  processes  in  a “what to do if something happens under certain conditions” manner. A common example of such a business rule would be the speciﬁcation of when and how a buyer can make changes to his or her order  see the fol- lowing subsection . For example, this would encompass temporal condi- tions followed by corresponding reactions.  Business-rule-related topics encompass their formulation or speciﬁca- tion, how to mine them from existing data, possibly the building of rule- driven  business  systems,  and  their  management  in  evolving  business environments. In this subsection we focus on the formulation and speci- ﬁcation of business rules. Traditionally business rules, like other business logic,  have  been  hard-coded  in  business  application  code  or  buried  in other IT components, such as stored procedures in DBMSs, and could not be  easily  accessed  or  even  managed  by  nontechnical  staff.  XML-based speciﬁcation is a solution to this problem.  That type of formulation might rely on more general principles, such as ontologies and knowledge representation, with background from arti- ﬁcial intelligence, such as inference and deduction. We will not discuss this in detail. Instead we present some general approaches to XML-based business rule deﬁnition. A more extended overview of the topic is given by Thorpe  2001 .  Formulation and speciﬁcation   234  Chapter 5 Modeling Processes  BRML  Business Rules in Contracts—The BRML Agent communication was the starting point for business rule research at IBM  www.research.ibm.com rules home.html . In the Business Rules for E-Commerce  BREC  project, rule-based business processes for e-commerce were investigated.  ACL  messages   see  Section  5.3.3   can  be  regarded  as  containers  that hold the business rules described in an appropriate language. ACL’s outer language, KIF, was not designed to be the proper choice for this. Instead Courteous Logic Programs  CLP  are used, which are an extension of as well as a complement to KIF.  Aiming  for  the  integration  of  such  a  language  with  the  Web  would require coding CLP in XML. Such an XML DTD is given as the Business Rules Markup Language  BRML . The BREC research aimed at supporting the translation of rules to and from heterogeneous rule systems or lan- guages, as well as to and from KIF  logic.stanford.edu kif  , along with pro- viding an XML-based interchange language, such as BRML, to perform such translation.  Consider the following rule: “A customer may modify an order 14 days or more prior to delivery if he or she is a preferred customer.” Given as a logic program expression, this rule would result in   orderModificationNotice ?Order, days 14   preferredCustomerOf ?Buyer,?Seller   ^ purchaseOrder ?Order,?Buyer,?Seller   The  “?”  indicates  a  logical  variable.  Let’s  translate  this  into  BRML  notation:                              5.4 Process Concepts and XML  235                                                  As stated before, IBM aimed at having a language that supports a com- mon understanding of business rules in contracts among agents and the modiﬁcation,  communication,  and  execution  of  rules  by  agents.  An implementation  of  BRML  is  IBM’s  Common  Rules  Java  Library   www .research.ibm.com rules commonrules-overview.html , which is a follow-up to the ABE agent framework.  BRML implementation  The Rule Markup Initiative The Rule Markup Language  RuleML  is based on an initiative that several parties  including the BRML group  participate in. The design of RuleML  www.dfki.uni-kl.de ruleml   is grounded on a hierarchy of rules  see Figure 5.14 . The hierarchy represents specialization relations, starting from the top-level reaction rules.  Reaction rules are known in active database research as event-condition- action  constructs.  Such  rules  are  triggered  if  the  deﬁned  event  occurs, which  requires  some  observation  mechanism.  Then  the  condition,  RuleML  Reaction rules   236  Chapter 5 Modeling Processes  Reaction Rules  Integrity Constraints  Derivation Rules  Figure 5.14 Rule hierarchy in RuleML.  Facts  Integrity constraints  simple or complex, is checked. Finally, if the condition evaluates to true, the action is ﬁred; that is, the procedure it contains is executed. This is a straightforward application of rules of that type.  Integrity constraints are also forward oriented. They check for inconsis- tency and signal if the conditions are fulﬁlled. Events are given by manip- ulation operations on databases.  Here is the structure of a reaction rule, including an action to signal an inconsistency, which would be based on the deﬁnition of a correspond- ing integrity constraint that it implements.                      premises      inconsistency    Derivation rules  A derivation rule is a specialization of reaction rules where the action is to draw a conclusion if the condition is fulﬁlled. These rules can be ap- plied  in  either  direction:  forward  assertion  of  conclusions  from  condi- tions as well as backward assertion of conditions from conclusions. Facts   5.4 Process Concepts and XML  237  are a further specialization having an empty list of premises so that the conclusion is always drawn.  So  far  the  main  effort  of  the  initiative  has  been  toward  derivation rules and  facts.  RuleML  has  been  hierarchically  modularized  into  a directed acyclic graph of DTDs for these rules, which is open for further sublanguages.  Exchange via Rule Engines—The SRML The Simple Rules Markup Language  SRML  is a proposal for a general- purpose  interlingua  that  allows  the  deﬁnition  of  rules  on  the  basis  of XML  for  their  exchange  between  rule  engines   xml.coverpages.org srml .html .  A  major  goal  is  to  abstract  the  process  rules  from  concrete  rule engines, and thereby be vendor independent.  This idea is based on providing a DTD to the rules community that speciﬁes  a  subset  of  common  rule  engine  language  constructs.  Rules deﬁned according to that schema can be translated and executed appro- priately on the target system.  An example in traditional syntax is  rule Discount {  when { ?s:ShoppingCart  purchaseAmount > 100  ; }  then { update ?s { discount = 0.1 }; } }  SRML  which rule marked up becomes        <simpleCondition className=”ShoppingCart”  objectVariable=”s”>                        238  Chapter 5 Modeling Processes                             Y  F L  M  A  E  T  So,  not  very  surprisingly,  SRML  rules  have  a  condition  part  and  an action  part.  Actions  provided  by  the  schema  are  modify, assert,  and retract. The condition is built from one or more test expressions.  5.5 CONCLUDING REMARKS  Since we have been working on several different concepts in this chapter, let’s summarize the main results and relations. So, what was this chapter all about? Recall our initial and still overall argument that process engi- neering is needed in today’s business-oriented information management. The process paradigm is powerful and is adequate for the analysis and description of business knowledge. The resulting models may be used in either   re- organization  projects  or  IT  development.  In  both  cases,  we expect to gain a sound basis for higher-quality solutions.  We also introduced a process-oriented approach based on the concepts of the π-calculus. It included the features of mobility and nondetermin- ism for the following two reasons:    First, since business organizations and environments are subject to in- creasing dynamism, change management should be supported. There- fore  formal  mechanisms  are  needed  to  provide  a  basis  for  realizing integrated process engineering methodologies. Such an approach in- cludes information analysis, modeling, seamless forward and reverse engineering, and ﬁnally simulation of process designs. The π-calculus provides concepts and an algebraic notation that may contribute to an appropriate solution at this point.  Team-Fly®   5.5 Concluding Remarks  239    Second, we argued for business concepts given in terms of a manage- ment of communication rather than of structures, as well as people- driven processes rather than process-driven people. This results from the  observation  that  business  activities  are  interactions,  and  inter- action is either communication or the exchange of goods. The prevail- ing workﬂow-oriented view of business processes may be appropriate for industrial processes, but it is not appropriate for service processes. So we need a modeling approach that is communication based. The  π-calculus promises to help at this point, too, by describing systems of communicating processes.  On  the  technical  level  the  approach  that  we  outlined  in  the  ﬁrst two sections of this chapter is very similar to what is known from agent- oriented technologies, where we ﬁnd many concepts and research results that may be applied to the process context. These range from the under- standing  of  communication  protocols  to  the  formulation  of  business knowledge in terms of rules, for instance. We then gave an overview of software agents and systems, leading us to the ADEPT system to support service processes in telecommunication.  Finally, the role of XML in the ﬁeld of business-process-oriented ap- proaches had to be made clear. To do this, we summarized the initiatives taken and results gained so far in this area. We focused on the formula- tion of process features in XML that have been identiﬁed before, all for the purposes of representation and exchange. This chapter outlined the BPMI architecture, and other efforts such as ebXML will be dealt with in Chapters 10 and 11.    6Communication  6.1 History  6.2  Layers of Communication  6.3 Channels and Ports  6.4  Speech Acts  6.5 Messages  6.6  6.7  Transactions and Protocols  Semantics of Communication  6.8  Security  For early transactional systems, data storage was one of  the most challenging aspects of computing. Today, with  ubiquitous networks, the focus of software engineering has  moved to communication. In this chapter we ﬁrst introduce  the conceptual aspects of communication. After describing a  layered communication model, we look at the transportation  environment for messages: channels and ports. Then we dis-  cuss the theory of speech acts that helps us to structure the  exchange of messages and leads to protocol patterns.  In Section 6.5, we look closer into the anatomy of message  implementation, and we discuss SOAP and XML Protocol as  practical examples. In Section 6.6, we discuss both the classi-  cal ACID transactions and the newer, process-oriented, long-  living transactions and how those transactions concepts can  be applied to Web services. Security issues are covered in Sec-  tion  6.8.  This  includes  a  discussion  of  two  security-related  standards: XML Signature and XML Encryption.  241   242  Chapter 6 Communication  6.1 HISTORY  McCarthy’s CBCL  As early as 1975 John McCarthy proposed a Common Business Commu- nication  Language   CBCL    McCarthy  1999 .  As  McCarthy  observed, “Developing an expressive Common Business Communication Language has proved unexpectedly difﬁcult.” The problem is not so much the syn- tax but that the problem is open-ended. You cannot stop at some stage and claim that all aspects are covered. For each business rule that is cov- ered by the model, it is easy to ﬁnd a more complicated business rule that is  not  yet  covered.  Just  take  the  following  rules  describing  shipment orders as an example:  1. Ship by express mail. 2. Ship by standard mail, but insure the parcel up to a value of $1,000. 3. Ship by truck, provided the truck is air-conditioned. 4. Ship  by  integrated  rail truck  door-to-door  service,  provided  the refrigeration chain is not interrupted for longer than 90 minutes. Request printed temperature protocol from pickup to delivery.  5. And so on.  We can see the problem. What would be required to cover all possible cases is a language with the expressive power of natural language. Natural language, however, is awkward to process with computers.  McCarthy solved the problem by devising an extensible business lan- guage  based  on  a  language  popular  for  building  artiﬁcial  intelligence applications: LISP. In CBCL the shipment orders could look like this:   shipment  carrier mail   method express     shipment  carrier mail   method standard   insurance   insured sum 1000     LISP vs. XML  tag, and nested lists make child elements:  We can easily translate these rules into XML. Each list head makes a  and so on.             mail     express      mail     standard     6.2 Layers of Communication  243      1000         and so on.  People trained in LISP will like the CBCL format better because it is more compact. However, we ﬁnd that XML makes it easier to determine the end of each structure: there is no need to count parentheses. A docu- ment standard such as XML was needed to bring John McCarthy’s idea of an extensible business communication language to widespread adop- tion.  No  wonder:  exchanging  documents  is  at  the  core  of  all  business communication.  6.2 LAYERS OF COMMUNICATION  The classical process model as it is used in enterprise application integra- tion  EAI  and workﬂow applications is not really applicable in an open electronic business scenario. These process models are described in terms of state transition diagrams, Petri nets, and message sequence charts  such as activity diagrams in UML . These techniques are well suited to the closed world  of  enterprise  business  processes  and  workﬂows  and  for  “closed world” long-term business relationships as we ﬁnd them in typical EDI partnerships.  The situation in electronic business, however, is different. Electronic business processes typically cross the boundaries of companies and long- term partnerships. Especially with smaller businesses  and for larger cor- porations that use the concept of autonomous work groups , there is a high degree of autonomy between the business partners. Collaborations frequently change and often are mediated through a market mechanism. For example, a manufacturer who wants to ship certain items to a cus- tomer will not use a single shipper but will dynamically select a shipper according to price, availability, quality, and so on. In some cases it may be necessary to use alternative services, for example, when the pilots are on strike or the rivers are ﬂooded. In these cases, the manufacturer must be able to quickly align his or her own business processes with those of a temporarily selected shipper.  Traditional modeling techniques such as state transition tables or Petri nets  have  problems  with  this  kind  of  required  ﬂexibility.  Early  experi- ences  with  the  application  of  these  techniques  to  electronic  business  Temporary partnerships   244  Chapter 6 Communication  New methods required  Layered metamodel  scenarios have led to the conclusion that the models become too com- plex when we want to cover each possible exception and contingency.  Researchers have therefore looked into ways to make the traditional process  model  more  ﬂexible  or  to  use  alternative  methods  to  describe open processes. In the previous chapter, we looked at Milner’s π-calculus as one possibility. In this chapter we will take a close look at the speech act theory  SAT  and communication patterns, so-called protocols, which are a basis for modeling transactions and access to Web services in electronic business. In later chapters we will see that some recent technologies such as ebXML and RosettaNet are based on similar principles.  These concepts follow a layered metamodel, as in Figure 6.1  Weigand,  van den Heuvel, and Dignum 1998 :    Messages are the most elementary part of such an architecture. A mes- sage  can  be  a  simple  signal,  such  as  an  acknowledgment,  or  it  can be quite  complex,  containing  one  or  several  business  documents.  A message may relate to its operational context  i.e., the transaction that it is a part of .    Transactions are  composed  of  messages   or  other  transactions .  That means that transactions can be nested, allowing the construction of complex transactions from simple transactions. A transaction is con- sidered as a logical unit of work that transforms the states of the par- ticipating systems from one valid state to another valid state. In the simplest case a transaction consists of two messages, a request and a re-  Scenario  Contract  Business Process  Business Service  Transaction  Message  Figure 6.1 Layered communication architecture in electronic business.   6.3 Channels and Ports  245  sponse.  Transactions  can  be  classical  ACID  transactions  or  long- running transactions  see Section 6.6.2 . Transactions occur in the con- text of a business process or a business service.    Business services implement generic business processes such as services  for funds transfer, credit card validation, invoicing, or remittance.    Business processes orchestrate transactions into an organic process. In their simplest form, business processes involve just two partners, but business  processes  involving  more  than  two  partners  can  be  con- structed by composing several simple business processes. Business pro- cesses occur in the context of a business contract.    A  business  contract is  negotiated  between  the  partners  involved  in  a prospective  business  process.  The  contract  determines  the  concrete form of the business process and deﬁnes the rights and responsibilities of each partner within the business process. The partners also agree on shared vocabularies  or ontologies , or on how to mediate between dif- ferent ontologies.  Business contracts are usually legally binding. A business contract is  negotiated in the context of a business scenario.    Business scenarios describe the context in which contracts are negoti- ated and business processes take place. These descriptions include part- ner proﬁles, describing the capabilities of each partner  technical capa- bilities,  supported  message  protocols,  and  so  on .  They  also  describe common context information, such as the national and cultural envi- ronment. Additionally business scenarios describe the interrelationship among several business contracts that are in effect simultaneously.  6.3 CHANNELS AND PORTS  Channels  organize  the  communication  between  end  points,  so-called ports. Messages are interchanged between these end points through the channels. A partner within a business process must own at least one port; otherwise it will not be able to communicate and take part in the pro- cess.  Channels  that  organize  the  communication  between  exactly  two end points are 1:1; channels that organize the communication from a single end point to multiple end points  multicast  are 1:m. Often 1:m channels  are  implemented  using  a  ﬁre-and-forget  strategy;  that  is,  the sender  does  not  expect  an  acknowledgment  from  the  receiver   typical broadcast situation .   246  Chapter 6 Communication  Channel parameters  The type of channel is deﬁned by the protocol—the valid sequences of messages between the partners. There are additional parameters that can characterize a channel:    Binding: The transport method used. Popular choices to transport mes-  sages are HTTP, SMTP, and FTP.    Reliability: A channel can be implemented as a persistent channel; that is, it guarantees the delivery of a message once the message has been accepted. This requires more overhead since the channel must imple- ment a persistent message store, where messages can survive a system crash.  An  alternative  solution  is  to  use  a  nonpersistent  channel.  In  this case it is preferable that the sender receives an acknowledgment when the  message  has  been  delivered.  This  may  happen  immediately  or lazily   i.e.,  the  acknowledgment  is  returned  in  a  bundle  with  some other trafﬁc that travels in the opposite direction . In this case it might happen that a message is sent twice  when the system is restarted after a  crash .  Either  the  channel  or  the  receiver  should  therefore  display idempotent behavior  i.e., discard duplicate messages .    Synchronicity: A channel may act synchronously or asynchronously. To receive a message synchronously, the client has to request a message. It then has to wait for the message  or to poll for it . A client who wants to receive messages asynchronously has to register with the channel and is notiﬁed when a message arrives.    Security: A channel may encrypt messages to transport them safely and enforce digital signature technology to ensure that no unsolicited mes- sages are sent.    Scalability: Channels may open alternative routes in case of heavy traf- ﬁc. Some channels may have a higher priority than other channels or may give certain messages a higher priority than other messages.  6.4 SPEECH ACTS  Speech act theory  SAT  goes back to John L. Austin’s How to Do Things with  Words  Austin  1975 .  Austin  postulated  that  language  statements not only transport a meaning but also accomplish something; that is, an issued statement has a practical purpose. It is that purpose that deﬁnes the illocutionary  force1 of  a  message.  Messages  can  thus  be  categorized  1The illocutionary force of an utterance is the speaker’s intention in producing that utterance.   6.4 Speech Acts  247  according to their illocutionary force  Moore 1996 . The following cate- gories are deﬁned: advise, ascribe, assent, assert, concede, conﬁrm, deny, describe, dispute, dissent, inform, offer, permit, predict, prohibit, prom- ise, question, report, request, require, retract.  Scott A. Moore and Steven O. Kimbrough have deﬁned a set of formal languages for business communication  FLBCs  on the basis of these mes- sage categories. Examples of the application of these FLBCs in message management systems are found in Kimbrough and Moore  1994 .  The paper also contains a lovely example of supply chain management in a bicycle shop.  Only recently an XML DTD has been published for the for- mal deﬁnition of these FLBCs through XML. Here is a short example of a question expressed in FLBC:  FLBCs                                          seem to be sufﬁcient:  For our requirements the following ﬁve basic categories  Dignum 2000   Basic categories    ASSERT: Messages of this type inform the receiver about a given fact. They do not require immediate action from the receiver. The receiver is free to believe the message or to ignore it. For example: “The authors of  The  XML-Handbook  are  Charles  F.  Goldfarb  and  Paul  Prescod.” ASSERT messages also include simple acknowledgments like “Your mes- sage has arrived.”    OFFER: Offers  or proposals  invite the receiver to request something or to  commit  to  something   see  DIRECT  and  COMMIT .  For  example: “Buy this book before next Saturday and get 15% off.”    DIRECT: This message type is used to transmit orders or requests to the receiver. This usually results in an obligation for the receiver that the   248  Chapter 6 Communication  Message patterns  receiver may choose to follow or not. For example: “Show me all books about XML.”    COMMIT: The COMMIT message type is used to create obligations for the sender itself; that is, the sender commits itself to do something. COMMIT messages often follow the reception of a DIRECT request. For example: “We will deliver within three days.”    DECLARE: This message type is used to create new facts. For example, it  may  be  used  to  equip  the  receiver  with  certain  access  rights.  This message type is mostly used during the negotiation phase and is hardly used in later stages of the communication. For example: “You have full access to all of my accounts.”  By  categorizing  messages  into  such  classes,  we  are  able  to  construct metapatterns of possible transactions. An example of such a metapattern could be:  Y  F L  1. Party A sends a request to Party B. 2. Party B sends an acknowledgment to Party A, to acknowledge the re-  3. Party B sends a commitment to Party A, to indicate that it is willing  4. Party A sends an acknowledgment to Party B to indicate that it has  M  A  ception of the message.  to process the request.  E  T  received the commitment.  Such  a  transaction  could  be  described  as  a  DIRECT-ASSERT-COMMIT- ASSERT  pattern.  The  pattern  also  deﬁnes  an  abstract  protocol  for  both partners. Software instances could be created that are able to handle these abstract protocols. These software instances can then be reused whenever such a communication pattern occurs—the abstract message categories are simply instantiated with concrete message types.  6.5 MESSAGES  In this section, we further investigate the anatomy of messages and how this anatomy is covered by messaging speciﬁcations such as SOAP.  6.5.1 Simple and Complex Messages  A message typically wraps a business document or a set of business docu- ments plus attachments into an envelope. The envelope is responsible for security; it can provide encryption and digital signatures  see Section 6.8 .  Team-Fly®   6.5 Messages  249  Signals  Message header  A special class of messages is signals—messages that do not carry a pay- load of documents but are simply used to trigger an event in the receiving process. Such signals are typically used to acknowledge the reception of a message or to inform about an exception.  A  message  can  contain  additional  metainformation  in  the  message header describing the documents, their current state, and processing in- structions for the documents.  The message header may contain the following information:    The encoding used for the message   Supported XML namespaces   Source and destination of the message   An identity pointer to identify the message uniquely, for example, a  UUID or a URI    Date and time when the message was sent   Date and time when the message expires   A pointer to the context where the message is valid, such as a business  process instance, a contract, or a scenario    Pointers to vocabularies used in documents and attachments   A description element, describing the topic of the message   A manifest, listing the documents and attachments contained in the    A ﬂag indicating if it is required to acknowledge the reception of the  message  message    A ﬂag indicating if it is required to acknowledge the positive commit-  ment to process the message  Concrete speciﬁcations of messaging architectures are described in Sec-  tions 6.5.2  SOAP , 10.3  ebXML , and 11.3.3  BizTalk .  6.5.2 SOAP  SOAP  Simple Object Access Protocol  started as a Microsoft initiative  in collaboration with UserLand Software and DevelopMentor  to use XML for remote method calls as a serialized transport format between distrib- uted objects.  SOAP  has  its  roots  in  XML-RPC   XML-RPC  1999 .  RPC  stands  for “remote procedure call.” XML-RPC addressed a problem existing in het- erogeneous  environments.  Distributed  component  systems  use  remote procedure calls to invoke a method in a remote object. The calling object has to transmit parameters to the called method. And, vice versa, results must be returned to the caller. Since both parameters and results can be  XML-RPC   250  Chapter 6 Communication  SOAP vs.  XML-RPC  Message composition  arbitrarily complex objects, it is necessary to convert them into a byte- stream in order to transmit them over the wire. This process is called seri- alization in Java and marshalling in DCOM and CORBA. As you can guess from the different names, the different component systems use different serialization  formats,  too.  To  call  a  CORBA  method  from  DCOM,  for example,  extra  “bridge”  software  is  necessary.  This  software  translates between the two serialization formats. XML-RPC solves this problem by providing  a  single  serialization  format:  XML.  Thus  XML-RPC  makes  it possible for CORBA objects to directly interoperate with DCOM or Java, and so on.  SOAP  evolved  directly  from  XML-RPC.  UserLand,  which  signed  for XML-RPC, was also involved in the development of SOAP. One key differ- ence from XML-RPC is how method parameters are identiﬁed. XML-RPC represents parameters without parameter names—parameters are identi- ﬁed  by  position.  SOAP  represents  parameters  with  their  names,  so sequence does not matter. This is the better choice because it is easier to identify parameters. It is also more XML-like.  In addition to the serialization issue, SOAP also addresses the issue of message composition. A typical SOAP message consists of an envelope, optional headers, and the message body.  The envelope deﬁnes the namespaces and encoding used in the mes- sage. Here is an example from the SOAP 1.1 speciﬁcation. It starts with the usual HTTP header, indicating a POST operation and declaring the content as “text xml”:  POST  StockQuote HTTP 1.1 Host: www.stockquoteserver.com Content-Type: text xml; charset=”utf-8” Content-Length: nnnn SOAPAction: “Some-URI” <SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV=  “http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope ”  SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle=  “http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap encoding ”>  …    Multiple headers are allowed in SOAP messages. Each header describes a  certain  aspect  of  the  message  such  as  quality  of  service,  security,  or transactional behavior. Here is a hypothetical header to deﬁne transac- tional behavior  currently not supported in SOAP :   6.5 Messages  251  SOAP adoption  <t:Transaction xmlns:t=”some-namespace-for-transactions”   SOAP-ENV:mustUnderstand=”1”>     5       The body carries the payload of the message—the serialized parameters of the action  or method  invoked  a complete example will come later . SOAP  is  not  a  high-speed  communication  method:  the  use  of  both HTTP  and  XML  takes  its  toll  in  terms  of  performance.  Instead,  SOAP addresses the need for a loosely coupled transport protocol that can work across company boundaries and between different component models. In the beginning, SOAP was somewhat COM centric; however, with ver- sion 1.1, SOAP is now neutral to component models and transfer proto- cols.  Many  other  manufacturers   Ariba,  CommerceOne,  Compaq,  HP, Iona, IBM, Lotus, SAP, Sun Microsystems  have joined the SOAP opera, and in the meantime SOAP has become a de facto standard. The Apache organization, for example, has adopted the IBM SOAP4J implementation as  the basis  of  an  open  source  reference  implementation.  Using  SOAP, component-oriented platforms such as DCOM, CORBA, and Enterprise Java Beans can interoperate with each other through HTTP, SMTP, POP3, or FTP. Because of the use of HTTP, SOAP gets around ﬁrewall problems.  However, administrators can conﬁgure ﬁrewalls not to accept SOAP mes- sages.   The  purpose  of  SOAP  is  described  in  Box  et  al.   2000   as  the following:  SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a decentral- ized, distributed environment. It is an XML based protocol that consists of three parts: an envelope that deﬁnes a framework for describing what is in a message  and  how  to  process  it,  a  set  of  encoding  rules  for  expressing  in- stances of application-deﬁned datatypes, and a convention for representing remote procedure calls and responses.  SOAP is used as a transport protocol in XML-based standards for elec-  tronic business such as BizTalk and ebXML.  The following example shows a typical SOAP request response data- stream using HTTP as the transfer protocol  SOAP can use other proto- cols, too :  POST  Validation HTTP 1.1 Host: www.cardservice.com   Content-Type: text xml; charset=”utf-8” Content-Length: nnnn    252  Chapter 6 Communication  SOAPAction: “CardValidation-URI”  <SOAP-ENV:Envelope  xmlns:SOAP-ENV=”http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope ” SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle=  “http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap encoding ”>         393837   907   4578987898990   06 04   USD   99.95           The  SOAP  body  indicates  that  method  ValidateCard in  namespace  CardValidation-URI within www.cardservice.com validation should  be invoked. The application at www.cardservice.com validation can be any type  of  Web  service,  such  as  a  CGI  script  or  a  servlet.  After  execution of the  invoked  method,  the  results  are  returned  via  a  SOAP  response message:  HTTP 1.1 200 OK  Content-Type: text xml; charset=”utf-8”  Content-Length: nnnn  <SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV=”http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap envelope ” SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle=  “http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap encoding ” >          907           Features  SOAP supports all the built-in datatypes deﬁned in XML Schema plus a number  of  complex  datatypes  such  as  variants  and  unions,  structures  “struct” , records, and arrays including multiple and nested arrays. All data is passed by value, not by reference. Apart from deﬁning standards   6.6 Transactions and Protocols  253  for  message  envelopes,  message  encoding,  and  remote  procedure  calls, SOAP does not cover other transport aspects, such as schema-based mes- sage  validation,  object  creation  and  destruction,  bidirectional  synchro- nous communication, distributed transactions, persistent messaging, or recovery from exceptions. These tasks are left to higher-level standards such as BizTalk or ebXML.  6.5.3 XML Protocol  SOAP 1.2  SOAP is a de facto industry standard. It is not a W3C recommendation yet,  but  it  has  been  submitted  to  the  W3C  for  consideration.  This  has resulted in a new W3C activity called XML Protocol  XMLP   Williams and Jones 2001 . The XMLP activity was inspired by SOAP but includes more advanced features and will eventually be the successor of SOAP. It now has been named SOAP 1.2.  Most important, XMLP is not an end-to-end protocol. Inspired by the deﬁnition of SOAP-RP  Nielsen and Thatte 2001 , it allows one or several intermediaries to forward a message. Intermediaries can remove blocks from a message and add new blocks to it  i.e., a modiﬁed block is a new block . This allows a kind of pipelined communication structure where a message  can  pass  through  several  processing  stages—an  interesting approach to establishing collaboration between various Web services.  6.6 TRANSACTIONS AND PROTOCOLS  The classical notion of a transaction is connected to the OLTP world. First restricted  to  single  database  management  systems,  the  classical  ACID transaction concept has subsequently been extended to distributed data- bases and to other transactional services such as transactional message- oriented middleware  MoM . Applications access these resources by means of interfaces as deﬁned by the XA  Transaction Authority  standard  e.g., the  Java  Transaction  API,  JTA .  XA  is  a  popular  standard  protocol  to orchestrate ACID transactions over distributed databases.  6.6.1 ACID Transactions ACID is an acronym for the four primary attributes ensured to any OLTP database transaction:    Atomicity: A transaction cannot be divided into smaller parts. Either all or none of the data elements involved in a transaction are committed to a transaction.  Pipelined messages  Deﬁnition of ACID   254  Chapter 6 Communication  Two-phase commit  XA  New requirements    Consistency: A transaction leads to a new and valid state. In case of a  failure, the transaction is reset to the previous valid state.    Isolation: A pending transaction must remain isolated from any other  transaction.    Durability: Once data has been committed it must stay—regardless of  system failures or restart—in its committed state.  A COMMIT is the last step in a successful database transaction. ROLL- BACK is used to abandon the current transaction and return the resources involved in the transaction to their original state.  In  distributed  OLTP  database  systems,  the  ACID  characteristics  are achieved by means of the two-phase commit. In the ﬁrst phase all part- ners involved in a transaction receive a signal “Prepare to commit.” Each partner responds with a “Ready to commit.” Only when all partners have signaled a “Ready to commit” is the ﬁnal “Commit” issued.  XA  supports  the  two-phase  commit  by  introducing  the  concept  of resource managers and transaction managers. The transaction manager is responsible for controlling the distributed transaction and coordinating the resource managers involved in the transaction. Resource managers are usually databases but can also be other transactional services, for exam- ple,  a  MoM  server.  Resource  managers  can  be  heterogeneous—systems from several manufacturers can engage in one distributed transaction.  6.6.2 Transactional Web Services  However, for orchestrating Web services, the classical two-phase commit is too strict. The classical two-phase commit requires resource managers to lock the resources involved in a transaction during its whole duration, from the beginning of the transaction until the ﬁnal commit. With Web services this could take a long time. Remember that a Web service may encapsulate other business processes and even human activity. Locking resources for such a long time would lead to Web services that perform badly when trafﬁc increases.  On  the  other  hand,  when  resources  are  not  locked,  they  cannot  be rolled  back  if  the  transaction  fails.  Another—competing—transaction may  have  changed  a  resource  in  the  meantime.  When  the  resource  is reset to its original status, the changes made by the second transaction are lost.  Take for example a credit card validation service. In transaction A, the credit card service is asked to charge $400 against the customer’s credit card account. Now, while transaction A is still pending, another transac-   6.6 Transactions and Protocols  255  tion B charges $300 against the same account and commits. Then trans- action A fails. Because it fails, everything must be set back to the original state  rollback . The consequence is that the charge of $300 from transac- tion B is lost. This is clearly unacceptable, and this is why OLTP databases lock their resources during a transaction.  The solution for non-OLTP environments such as electronic business or Web services lies in the introduction of compensating actions. When transaction A fails, it will not physically roll back all resources involved in a  transaction  but  will  trigger  compensating  actions.  In  our  case  it  will credit $400 to the account, thus compensating the previous $400 debit.  Because  these  compensating  actions  work  on  a  semantic  level,  they require additional development effort. The programmer cannot just rely on the rollback mechanisms of the resource managers but has to imple- ment compensating actions.  Typically, long-running transactions are integrated into orchestration services  see, for example, the BizTalk orchestration services discussed in Section 11.3.3 . To support long-running transactions, providers of trans- actional Web services are therefore required to offer for each transactional Web  request  type  a  corresponding  request  type  for  a  compensation action.  6.6.3 The Web Services Description Language  WSDL   The interface to a service  transactional or not  is described by a certain sequence of messages  for example, following a pattern as discussed in Section 6.3  and the format of these messages  i.e., a protocol . Usually such a protocol is deﬁned for a given port, and each Web service can pos- sess several ports; that is, it is able to support several protocols. Such pro- tocols  can  be  deﬁned  with  the  Web  Services  Description  Language  WSDL .  The Web Services Description Language, a proposal to the W3C  Chris- tensen et al. 2001 , is a joint initiative of Ariba, IBM, and Microsoft. The same collaborators also started an initiative for the deﬁnition of UDDI  see Section 7.3 , which complements WSDL in that it speciﬁes the regis- tration and discovery of Web services. Other companies joined the ini- tiative, including Hewlett-Packard, which—after some political quarrels— opted to integrate its own development, e-speak, with WSDL and UDDI. WSDL  describes  “Web  services”  in  an  abstract  way.  A  Web  service is deﬁned  as  a  collection  of  end  points   or  ports   capable  of  performing operations  and  exchanging  messages.  WSDL  covers  only  synchronous operations.  Long-running transactions  Politics   256  Chapter 6 Communication  The abstract deﬁnition of each end point can then be bound to a con- crete communication protocol. The necessary binding mechanism is de- ﬁned in WSDL, too. Special predeﬁned bindings currently exist in SOAP, HTTP GET POST, and MIME.  A  port  thus  establishes  a  binding  between  a  sequence  of  operations and a concrete message protocol and format. Because a Web service can incorporate several ports, it can accept several message sequences  and perform operations on them  and can communicate using several mes- sage protocols.  A WSDL description consists of ﬁve major elements:  Elements of a WSDL description  1.   2.   3.   4.   5.      contains  the  datatype  deﬁnitions  that  are  used  to  de- scribe the messages exchanged between the ports. WSDL does not intro- duce its own type system but uses the XML Schema type system  see also Chapter  2 .  XML  Schema  expressions  are  directly  embedded  between   ...   tags in the form of   elements. Each element occurrence deﬁnes one type.    represents an abstract deﬁnition of the data being transmitted. Each message consists of one or multiple parts, and each part deﬁnition refers to a type deﬁnition  see above . This allows us to  compose  a  message  from  several  type  deﬁnitions   i.e.,  one  mes- sage can  transport  several  business  documents .  There  may  be  several    deﬁnitions.  Each portType contains one or several   ele- ments.  These  deﬁne  abstract  operations.  Each  operation  element  may contain   and <wsdl:output name=... message=...> elements that refer to input and output messages.   Additionally,  an  operation  element  also  may  contain  a  <wsdl:fault  Operation types  There are four different operation types:  name=... message=... > element for error messages.    One-way: The end point receives a message. portType contains only an  input element.    Request-response: The end point receives a message and sends a corre- lated  message.  portType contains  a  sequence  of  input, output,  and fault message elements.   6.6 Transactions and Protocols  257    Solicit-response: The end point sends a message and receives a correlated message. portType contains  a  sequence  of  output, input,  and  fault message elements.    Notiﬁcation: The end point sends a message. portType contains only an  output element.    describes to which concrete proto- col and data formats the operations and messages of a particular portType are  bound.   The  attribute  type refers  to  a  speciﬁc  portType.   Child  ele- ments map each abstract operation and its input and output messages to concrete operations and data formats.  The mapping of abstract input and output messages to concrete mes- sages involves the transformation of messages if both message formats differ. Thus, clients are not required to use the concrete message format of the Web service.    describes a complete service. Each service element can contain one or several   elements. Each of these port elements represents a communication end point and refers to a speciﬁc binding element. Additionally, it speciﬁes the network address of the end point.  Here is an example of a WSDL Web service description, based on Chris-  tensen et al.  2001 :    <definitions name=”StockQuote”  targetNamespace=”http:  example.com stockquote.wsdl”  xmlns:sqw=”http:  example.com stockquote.wsdl” xmlns:sqt=”http:  example.com stockquote.xsd” xmlns:soap=”http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org wsdl soap ” xmlns=”http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org wsdl ”>     <schema  targetNamespace=”http:  example.com stockquote.xsd” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 2000 10 XMLSchema”>                  258  Chapter 6 Communication                              Y  F L          M  A                      E  T        <binding name=”StockQuoteSoapBinding”  type=”sqw:StockQuotePortType”>  <soap:binding style=”document”   transport=”http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap http” >    <soap:operation  soapAction=”http:  example.com GetLastTradePrice” >                        Team-Fly®   6.7 Semantics of Communication  259      My fiirst service  <port name=”StockQuotePort”   binding=”sqw:StockQuoteBinding”>             This  WSDL  example  ﬁrst  deﬁnes  two  complex  XML  datatypes,  Trade- PriceRequest and TradePrice, using XML Schema as the speciﬁcation lan- guage.  It  then  deﬁnes  two  message  types,  GetLastTradePriceInput and GetLastTradePriceOutput, that use these datatypes for the deﬁnition of their respective message bodies. Next it deﬁnes a port type named Stock- QuotePortType.  This  port  supports  one  operation,  GetLastTradePrice, which takes GetLastTradePriceInput as the input message and GetLast- TradePriceOutput as the output message. The next section then describes SOAP as the transport service for the operation GetLastTradePrice. The last section describes the whole service, StockQuoteService, by listing its operations with their bindings.  At present, WSDL can describe Web services only in a static way. There is no way to describe how the operations can be orchestrated into a busi- ness process or workﬂow. This is left to future versions of WSDL.  6.7 SEMANTICS OF COMMUNICATION  The semantics of a message not only matters to the source and the target of a message, that is, the sender and the receiver. In many cases it will also  be  necessary  that  the  content  of  a  message  be  interpreted  by  the channel, too, in order to provide services such as ontology mapping and content-based routing.  6.7.1 Content-Based Routing  In many cases it is necessary to change the route and even the destina- tion of a message based on content. For example, a customer might send an order to a company but not know which department handles the spe- ciﬁc order. An intelligent router can look at the message, apply business rules to determine the receiving department, and change the destination address accordingly.  Limitations   260  Chapter 6 Communication  6.7.2 Ontology Mapping  When the two partners do not share an ontology, they have to use a medi- ation process to translate the message from one ontology into another. In the simplest case this is a translation of vocabularies or taxonomies, but it can  amount  to  more  complex  transformations  in  document  structure. This is a typical job for an XSLT style sheet  see Chapter 9 . Carlson  2001  has an example of an XSLT style sheet that translates from a RosettaNet ITTD taxonomy to the CatML taxonomy.  However, the naive approach of direct translation from one ontology into another usually causes havoc—the number of transformations sim- ply explodes with an increasing number of ontologies. A more sophisti- cated approach lies in the deﬁnition of a generic pivot ontology that can cover a wide range of existing ontologies. Messages that must be trans- lated from ontology A into ontology B are translated in two steps: ﬁrst from ontology A into the pivot ontology, then from the pivot ontology into ontology B.  6.8 SECURITY  Security  is  an  important  aspect  of  communication.  On  the  Internet  a whole arsenal of security techniques has been developed over the years. On the physical level, Secure Socket Layers  SLL  allows safe communi- cation between communication end points. However, it solves only part of the problem: what happens before or after the end points is not pro- tected by SSL.  Seamless  security  can  only  be  achieved  by  applying  security  tech- niques on the application level. Popular methods for achieving security on the application level are Pretty Good Privacy  PGP  and Secure MIME  S MIME .  However,  both  methods  require  that  applications  support these methods. Also, both methods can only encrypt either a whole doc- ument or nothing. This is not always required and not always wanted: a document  may  contain  parts  that  must  be  readable  to  the  public,  and other parts that must be kept conﬁdential.  In early 1999 the W3C began with the deﬁnition for a security archi- tecture for XML. We will see that this architecture can provide ﬂexible security not only to XML documents but also to all objects that can be addressed through a URI.  Physical level  Application level   6.8 Security  261  6.8.1 Basics  A security architecture is based on the following security services:  Security services  The technologies to implement these services are well known:  Implementations    Conﬁdentiality: A  conﬁdential  document  should  not  be  read  by  un-  authorized persons. This can be ensured by encrypting the data.    Integrity: Integrity means that the unauthorized modiﬁcation of data can be detected. Integrity can be ensured by computing message di- gests  see below .    Authentication: Authentication ensures the origin of data or the iden- tity of communication partners. Data origin authentication is achieved by  computing  digital  signatures  and  message  authentication  codes  MACs .  These  are  message  digests  that  can  only  be  computed  and checked with a secret key.    Nonrepudiation: Nonrepudiation combines data integrity with data ori- gin  authentication,  so  that  the  sender  of  the  data  cannot  repudiate modiﬁcations that he or she applied to the data, for example, digitally signing the data. This makes legally binding digital contracts possible.    Symmetric encryption keys: This encryption method uses the same key for encryption and decryption. This encryption method is fast, but, be- cause sender and receiver must possess the same key, the transmission of the key poses a security risk. Keys with a length of at least 128 bits are considered safe. Examples are AES  128–256 bits , Blowﬁsh  64–448 bits , and Twoﬁsh  128–256 bits .    Asymmetric keys: These keys always come in pairs: a public key is used by the sender to encrypt the message, and a private key  which must be kept secret  is used by the receiver to decrypt the message. Examples of such keys are RSA  Rivest-Shamir-Adleman  and ECC. The advan- tage of asymmetric keys is that they do not involve an insecure step  exchange  of  keys   and  don’t  require  much  management.  However, the algorithms used are very slow.    Hybrid keys: This technique involves a pair of asymmetric keys and a symmetric key. As a ﬁrst step, sender and receiver exchange the sym- metric  key  but  encrypt  this  exchange  with  the  asymmetric  key.  The following communication can then be safely encrypted with the sym- metric key.    Message  digests:  Message  digest  algorithms  are  used  to  compute  a hash value from data that must be protected against tampering. The   262  Chapter 6 Communication  algorithms used are fast and guarantee that any change in the message content will cause a signiﬁcant change in the hash value. To be safe the minimum  length  of  hash  values  is  160  bits.  Popular  algorithms  to compute hash values are MD5  but already classiﬁed as unsafe , SHA-1  Secure Hash Algorithm, Revision 1 , and RIPEMD160  RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest .    Digital  signatures:  Digital  signatures  use  an  asymmetric  technique  to generate  a  signature  from  the  content  of  the  signed  document.  The signer  uses  a  private  key  to  generate  the  signature  value,  while  the reader uses a public key to check the validity of the signature. Again, because asymmetric algorithms are slow, hybrid techniques are used. First, a message digest is computed from the document content; then the digest value is protected by the asymmetric key. Popular methods for digital signatures are DSA  Digital Signature Algorithm  and RSA.    Certiﬁcates: The problem with public keys is that a third party may in- tercept the publication of a public key and replace it with its own pub- lic  key.  Thereafter  it  could  read  any  messages  encrypted  with  that public key. This problem is solved by certifying public keys. A certiﬁ- cation authority  CA  certiﬁes public keys by embedding them into a certiﬁcate. A sender that wants to use the public key of the message receiver can ask for a certiﬁcate containing this public key. To check the authenticity of the certiﬁcate, the sender can validate it against the public  key  of  the  CA.  Public  keys  of  CAs  are  hard-coded  into  client software such as Web browsers or signature programs.  6.8.2 XML Security  The XML security architecture is based on cryptography methods such as DSA and RSA. In the next two subsections we will discuss the two stan- dards, XML Signature and XML Encryption, that deal with cryptography. Based on these two standards are security architecture components such as the following:    The Security Assertion Markup Language  SAML  is used for the safe    The XML Access Control Language  XACML  allows the deﬁnition of    XML Key Management Services  XKMS  provides an XML interface to  exchange of user privileges.  access rights to XML data.  public key infrastructures.   6.8 Security  263  6.8.3 XML Signature  XML Signature describes the syntax and processing model of XML-based signatures and has the status of a W3C proposed recommendation  East- lake, Reagle, and Solo 2001 . XML Signature allows the digital signature of any kind of Web objects including XML objects. In contrast to existing systems like S MIME, XML Signature can sign not only a single object but also multiple objects. Also new is the possibility of embedding a signature into objects. XML Signature uses a distributed concept by allowing the reference  of  signed  objects,  signature  algorithms,  and  transformation algorithms through URIs.  When signing XML documents or elements, signature algorithms use the character representation of the document or element to compute the signature. This creates a problem: since the same XML information set may have different character representations, this would result in differ- ent signatures for the same content. XML Signature therefore allows the transformation of an XML document or element into a canonical form before computing the signature.  There are three signature ﬂavors in XML Signature:    Enveloping  signature:  An  enveloping  signature  wraps  the  signed  con- tent. The signature element contains the signed content element as a child element.    Detached signature: The signature refers to a remote content element   within the same document or in another document .    Enveloped  signature:  The  content  element  contains  the  signature  ele-  ment as a child element.  The following example shows a simple detached signature:  <Signature Id=”MyFirstSignature”   xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 2000 09 xmldsig”>     <CanonicalizationMethod Algorithm=  “http:  www.w3.org TR 2001 REC-xml-c14n-20010315” >  <SignatureMethod Algorithm=  “http:  www.w3.org 2000 09 xmldsigdsa-sha1” >  <Reference  URI=”http:  www.w3.org TR 2000 REC-xhtml1-20000126 ”>    <Transform Algorithm=  Signature ﬂavors   264  Chapter 6 Communication  “http:  www.w3.org TR 2001 REC-xml-c14n-20010315” >    <DigestMethod Algorithm=  “http:  www.w3.org 2000 09 xmldsigsha1” >   j6lwx3rvEPOOvKtMup4NbeVu8nk=        MC0CFFrVLtRlk=...      ...  ...  ...  ...                    The signature elements explained the following:    The  element  Signature acts  as  a  container  element  for  the  whole    The  element  SignedInfo acts  as  a  container  for  the  references  to  all  signature.  signed objects.    The element CanonicalizationMethod points to the algorithm used to transform the SignedInfo element into canonical form before it is di- gested as part of the signature operation.    The element SignatureMethod points to the algorithm that is used to convert  the  canonicalized  SignedInfo into  the  signature  value.  This algorithm  consists  of  a  combination  of  the  digest  algorithm,  a  key- dependent algorithm, and other algorithms.    The Reference elements point to the single signed objects. For each ob- ject, it is possible to deﬁne a transformation algorithm that is applied before the digest value is computed, the digest algorithm, and the di- gest value that signs the object.    SignatureValue contains the computed signature for the SignedInfo el- ement and thus secures the SignedInfo element against manipulation.   The optional element KeyInfo contains information about certiﬁcates,  public keys, or key identiﬁers.   6.8 Security  265  6.8.4 XML Encryption  XML Encryption, currently a W3C working draft, deﬁnes how arbitrary data can be represented in encrypted form in XML  Eastlake and Reagle 2001 . The standard addresses the following encryption targets:    Arbitrary binary data   Complete XML documents   XML elements including start and end tags   Element content  Here is an example of the encryption of XML element content:         John Smith     <EncryptedData xmlns=’http:  www.w3.org 2001 04 xmlenc’ Type=’http:  www.w3.org 2001 04 xmlencContent’>     A23B45C56             The element EncryptedData is the result of an encryption process. The attribute Type shows that EncryptedData contains element content, not a whole element. Similarly, the element EncryptedKey  not shown here  is used  to  transport  encryption  keys  to  a  communication  partner  as  re- quired with hybrid encryption methods.  The CipherValue element contains the encrypted content. If this value is  not  supplied  directly,  a  CipherReference element  may  instead  point  through a URI  to a resource containing the encrypted content.  Optionally,  the  EncryptedData element  may  contain  an  Encryption-  Method element to specify the encryption algorithm.  In  addition  to  the  deﬁnition  of  its  own  syntactical  elements,  XML Encryption utilizes the concepts and syntax of XML Signature to specify things such as transformations or key information.    7Navigation and  Discovery  7.1 Hypermedia  7.2  Topic Maps  7.3 Directory Services   UDDI   7.4  Peer-to-Peer Architectures  T he  most  characteristic  navigation  method  for  the  World  Wide  Web  is  the  hyperlink  as  supported  by  HTML. The XML speciﬁcation, in contrast, does not deﬁne a  navigation  method.  In  Section  7.1  we  ﬁrst  discuss  XLink,  a  W3C  recommendation  that  introduces  powerful  hyperlink  techniques  into  the  world  of  XML.  A  discussion  of  WebML  completes  this  section.  WebML  is  a  modeling  method  that  integrates  a  structural  model,  a  navigational  model,  and  a  presentational model.  Concepts such as RDF and topic maps extend the hyper-  text metaphor to semantic navigation. RDF  see Section 3.3   was  developed  in  order  to  describe  Web  resources,  while  topic maps had their ﬁrst application in the area of knowl-  edge  bases  and  interactive  encyclopedias.  We  will  discuss  topic maps in detail in Section 7.2.  267   268  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  Y  F L  M  Hypertext techniques are based on the signpost metaphor—the end user is led through the Web, link by link. This is not always sufﬁcient, as the exis- tence of search engines proves. Services that lie beyond the horizon cannot be seen by the surfer. In Section 7.3 we discuss UDDI, an XML-based lan- guage that supports the registration and discovery of Web services through public repositories.  Peer-to-peer  technology  relies  on  a  different  concept.  Systems  such  as Gnutella or Freenet do not rely on signposts or central repositories but work by “word-of-mouth propaganda.” To ﬁnd certain information items, you sim- ply ask your neighbors. They in turn ask their neighbors, and so on. We will discuss peer-to-peer technology in Section 7.4.  7.1 HYPERMEDIA  A  E  Originally, the World Wide Web was designed as a huge library. The pro- tocol for the Web, http:, was designed for the collaborative authoring of documents. We have to remember that the Internet has its roots in the scientiﬁc  sphere.  The  Internet  was  used  directly  by  the  end  users   i.e., humans   for  the  authoring,  exchange,  and  retrieval  of  documents  and ﬁles. The main metaphor for the Web, the hyperlink, has its roots in sci- entiﬁc texts and encyclopedias; highly hyperlinked texts look very scien- tiﬁc  indeed  but  can  drive  nonacademic  users  nuts.  Hypertexts  existed long before the Web, and even then the expression “lost in hyperspace” was popular.  T  Therefore, it is not wrong to look at the experience of the multimedia and hypermedia camp. XML applications—despite the origins of XML as a puritan document standard—can possess rich multimedia layers. There are already a couple of XML-based standards that make this possible: SVG and SMIL. Also, in terms of navigation, a lot can be learned from the so- phisticated models developed in the hypermedia camp.  7.1.1 A Short History of Hypermedia The history of hypertext dates back to 1945. In that year Vannevar Bush published an article, “As We May Think”  Bush 1945 , that pushed the idea of associative indexing:  It affords an immediate step, however, to associative indexing, the basic idea of  which  is  a  provision  whereby  any  item  may  be  caused  at  will  to  select immediately and automatically another.  The actual terms “hypertext” and “hypermedia” were coined by Ted Nelson in 1965, in an article published in Literary Machines  Nelson 1982 :  Team-Fly®   7.1 Hypermedia  269  By  “hypertext”  [we]  mean  nonsequential  writing—text  that  branches  and allows choice to the reader, best read at an interactive screen.  The ﬁrst hypertext system was originally developed by van Dam for IBM in 1967. It was later used for project documentation in the Apollo space program. Other hypertext milestones include the following  Niel- son 1997 :    1968: NLS by Doug Engelbart  who also invented the mouse  at Stan-    1978: The Aspen Movie Map by Andrew Lippman of MIT Architecture  ford Research Institute  Machine Group    1981: The never-implemented Xanadu by Ted Nelson   1985: Xerox’s NoteCards   1987: HyperCard by Bill Atkinson of Apple Computer  7.1.2 Hypermedia Navigation Often, the logical relations that exist between information items in a con- ceptual model or a presentation-neutral XML implementation are mis- understood as navigation structures. Although these logic relations form the basis for navigation structures, they are not identical with them. The design of navigation structures must not only take logic into account, but also  has  to  focus  on  themes  such  as  user  friendliness,  perception,  psy- chology, different usage patterns, and so on.  The following guidelines apply to almost any hypermedia system:    Pages must be self-sufﬁcient. They must explain a topic without requir- ing the user to jump between different pages. This can require a certain amount of repetition and redundancy between pages, a “no-no” in the conceptual model.    Pages must allow the discovery of related pages and navigation to them. This often requires adding additional information to a page. Take for exam- ple the relationship between a purchase order and a customer docu- ment   see  also  Figure  3.15  in  Section  3.2.3 .  Because  the  conceptual model requires only an arrow leading from the purchase order to the customer document, the reader of the customer page would not notice the existence of orders made by this customer. So, the customer page should inform the reader about purchase order pages pointing to this customer page. It should include hyperlinks that allow the reader to jump to these pages.  This requires a transformation from a presentation-neutral, struc- tural  content  model  to  a  navigational  model  and  ﬁnally  into  a  Guidelines   270  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  The comic book     Simple links  presentation format. Later in this section, we will discuss as an exam- ple WebML, an integrated system that does exactly that. But before we do this, let’s take a close look at XLink, a W3C recommendation that allows the speciﬁcation of hyperlinks in XML presentation formats.  Linking between Documents  XLink  XLink  speciﬁes  the  syntax  and  semantics  of  links  between  and  within XML documents. Links in XML can be compared to links in HTML that are  speciﬁed  using  the  HREF  attribute.  However,  the  functionality  of XLink goes far beyond that of HTML  DeRose, Maler, and Orchard 2001 .  A typical HTML link could look like the following:     XLink had to ﬁnd another syntax for representing links. There is no   tag in XML—there aren’t any predeﬁned tags. Instead we want to be able to equip any XML element with link information. This is only pos- sible if all link information is added in the form of attributes. A simple link  in  XLink—which  has  more  or  less  the  functionality  of  a  link  in HTML—looks like this:  <bs:catalogItem  xmlns:bs=”http:www.bookshop.com books” xmlns:xlink=”http:  www.w3.org 1999 xlink” xlink:type=”simple” xlink:href= “http:www.bookshop.com books isbn0-8833-9898-4”  >  The comic book    Link ingredients  After specifying a user domain namespace preﬁx bs and an XLink name- space  preﬁx  xlink,  the  actual  link  information  is  given:  the  link  type  always  required   is  set  to  “simple”,  and  with  href the  location  of  the remote resource is speciﬁed.  That  doesn’t  look  too  different  from  HTML,  and  it  does  the  same  thing. Let’s now take a closer look at the ingredients of a link:    Each link establishes a working relationship between several resources. In the previous example, we have exactly two resources: the element that contains the link forms the local resource, and the target URI lo-   7.1 Hypermedia  271  cates a remote resource. Remote resources can be any Web object, in- cluding non-XML objects such as images, sound ﬁles, video clips, and so on.  If we generalize this concept to n:m relationships, we get links that  lead from n resources to m resources.    The relation between any two resources can be represented by an arc. Within a relation each participating resource can take a speciﬁc role. An arc can also be associated with an arcrole, which is useful when there are several arcs pointing from or to a resource.    When a link is actuated—usually when the user requests it—the current focus traverses from a “from” resource to a “to” resource. In a browser, for example, the new resource usually replaces the current resource in the browser window. However, it is also possible that the new resource is shown in a separate window or in another frame.  Let’s look at another HTML example:     Although  not  a  hyperlink,  this  element  represents  a  link  between  two resources:  the    element  as  a  local  resource  and  the  JPEG  ﬁle  as  a remote resource  see Figure 7.1 . But there are a few things different from the previous example. First, the link is actuated not by a user request but when  the  containing  Web  page  is  loaded.  The  remote  resource   the image  neither replaces the current window content nor is shown in a separate window. Instead, it is embedded into the current window con- tent. Finally, this link is equipped with a title  the ALT attribute , which is shown as long as the remote resource is not loaded, or when the mouse hovers over an image.  Using XLink we could express such a behavior as  <bs:coverImage  xmlns:bs=”http:www.bookshop.com books” xmlns:xlink=”http:  www.w3.org 1999 xlink” xlink:type=”simple” xlink:href=”cover0-8833-9898-4.JPG” xlink:actuate=”onLoad” xlink:show=”embed” xlink:title=”The comic book”   >  As we can see, XLink can cover the full linking functionality in HTML with simple links. Extended links go far beyond this functionality. In par- ticular, they allow many-to-many links.   272  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  cover0-8833-9898-4.JPG     The comic book  Figure 7.1 A simple link is a unidirectional connection between two resources.  Link properties  Let’s ﬁrst give an overview of possible link properties:  type href role arcrole title show actuate label from to  simple, extended, locator, arc, resource, title, none Speciﬁes the location of a remote resource via a URL The speciﬁc role of a resource The speciﬁc role of an arc The link title new, replace, embed, other, none onLoad, onRequest, other, none Identiﬁes a resource for link purposes Speciﬁes “from” resource via a label Speciﬁes “to” resource via a label  Extended links  The link types locator, arc, resource, title, and none are used for the further  speciﬁcation  of  extended  links.  But  how  can  we  apply  them? xlink:type is an attribute, and in XML we aren’t able to deﬁne properties for attributes. The problem is solved with a trick: An element with the xlink:type=”extended” attribute is said to be an extended link element. This  element  is  equipped  with  child  elements,  which  in  turn  have  at- tributes like xlink:type=”locator” and so on.  <bs:bookAuthorLink  xmlns:bs=”http:www.bookshop.com books” xmlns:xlink=”http:  www.w3.org 1999 xlink” xlink:type=”extended”> <bs:bookres  xlink:type=”resource” xlink:label=”book” xlink:role=   7.1 Hypermedia  273  “http:  www.bookdomain.com linkprops books”>  The comic book    <bs:authorloc  xlink:type=”locator” xlink:href=”http:www.freelist.com ggoose” xlink:label=”aut” xlink:role=  “http:  www.bookdomain.com linkprops authors”  xlink:title=”Gustave Goose”  >  <bs:authorloc  xlink:type=”locator” xlink:href=”http:www.cartoonworld.com mpiggy” xlink:label=”aut” xlink:role=”http:  www.bookdomain.com authors” xlink:title=”Miriam Piggy”  >  <visitAuthors  xlink:type=”arc” xlink:from=”book” xlink:to=”aut” xlink:title=”Visit the authors’ homepages” xlink:actuate=”onRequest” xlink:show=”new”  >     An extended link is constructed from resource elements, locator ele- ments, and arc elements. Each arc element constructs a link from a group of resource elements to a group of locator elements. Groups are identiﬁed by the label attribute of each element: Elements with the same label value belong to the same group.  Here we have speciﬁed one resource type element  . This ele- ment acts as a local resource. It belongs to a one-element group named “book”. Then we have two locator type elements specifying the respec- tive home page URLs for each author. Both elements belong to the same group named “auth”. Finally we have one arc type element  see Figure 7.2 . This element establishes a link from all elements with label “book” to all elements with label “aut”. In our case this would result in a 1:2 link because we have one element with label “book”  the local resource  and two elements with label “aut”. We could, of course, have modeled these relationships with two simple links. However, the behavior would be dif- ferent. In an XLink-aware browser, two simple links would show up as  Local resources   274  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  "http:www.freelist.com ggoose"  Gustave Goose  book  local resource  "http:www.cartoonworld.com mpiggy"  arc  auth  locator  locator  Miriam Piggy  Figure 7.2 The arc element connects the local resource contained in group book with the two external resources speciﬁed in group auth.  two separate items. This extended link would show up as a single item in- stead. If it is actuated, the browser can immediately open two new win- dows displaying the home pages of each author. Or it could show a con- text  menu  containing  the  menu  items  “Gustave  Goose”  and  “Miriam Piggy” and allow the user to select one.  Extended links can contain more than one arc. For example, we could have added additional locator elements pointing to book reviews and an additional arc element titled “Read book reviews”:  Multiple arcs  <bs:reviewloc  xlink:type=”locator” xlink:href=”http:www.toons.com reviews july2000_5” xlink:label=”rev” xlink:role=  “http:  www.bookdomain.com linkprops reviews”  xlink:title=”cartoons.com”  >  <bs:reviewloc  xlink:type=”locator” xlink:href=”http:www.review.org 2000 the_comic_book” xlink:label=”rev” xlink:role=  “http:  www.bookdomain.com linkprops reviews”  xlink:title=”review.org”  >   7.1 Hypermedia  275  <readReviews  xlink:type=”arc” xlink:from=”Book” xlink:to=”rev” xlink:title=”Read reviews” xlink:actuate=”onRequest” xlink:show=”embed”  >  This  is  another  1:2  arc,  leading  from  the    resource  to  both reviews. In this case, we embed the review into the current page but only when the user requests it.  As a special service to the authors, we could make the reviews available  to the authors’ home pages, too:  <reviewsForAuthors xlink:type=”arc” xlink:from=”aut” xlink:to=”rev” xlink:title=”Reviews for ‘The Comic Book’” xlink:actuate=”onRequest” xlink:show=”new”  >  This 2:2 arc, however, creates a problem because now we have deﬁned an outgoing  arc  from  remote  resources   the  authors’  home  pages .  How should the authors’ home pages know that this link exists? The solution is  to  modify  the  authors’  home  pages  and  to  include  a  pointer  to  the document that contains these link deﬁnitions. Such a document is called a  link  database,  or  linkbase.  A  pointer  to  a  linkbase  can  be  expressed with XLink  just  as  well  and  is  identiﬁed  by  a  special  xlink:arcrole speciﬁcation:  Linkbases     <res1  xlink:type=”locator” xlink:label=”r1” xlink:href=”index.xml” >  <linkbase  xlink:type=”locator” xlink:label=”linkbase” xlink:href=   >  “http:www.bookshop.com books the_comic_book”   276  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  “http:  www.w3.org 1999 xlink properties linkbase”  <loadLinks  xlink:type=”arc” xlink:arcrole=  xlink:from=”r1” xlink:to=”linkbase” actuate=”onLoad”  >     Loading linkbases  Such a deﬁnition can be enclosed in each author’s home page  which we have assumed to be named “index.xml” . When the page is loaded, the link is actuated. In this case the actuation of the link causes the link deﬁnitions deﬁned in the linkbase to be loaded. They can then be evalu- ated by the browser and presented to the user  see Figure 7.3 .  Using linkbases can drastically reduce maintenance efforts for a Web site, especially when the same link deﬁnitions are used in many docu- ments. To subsequently modify the link structure of a site, it is only nec-  "http:www.freelist.com ggoose"  Gustave Goose  "http:www.cartoonworld.com mpiggy"  locator  locator  auth  arc  rev  locator  locator  Miriam Piggy  cartoons.com  "http:www.toons.com reviews july2000_5"  review.org  "http:www.review.org 2000 the_comic_book"  Figure 7.3 Using a linkbase. The authors’ pages point to the linkbase, which contains all the necessary link information. This makes this information available to the authors’ pages.   7.1 Hypermedia  277  essary to modify the linkbases. The content pages can remain untouched. The  linkbase  can  be  made  known  to  the  client  by  embedding  a  link pointing to the linkbase into each document or, even better, by register- ing the browser with the linkbase.  WebML Although it is possible to embed hyperlinks into XML documents using XLink, there are currently very few browsers that can handle this type of link  Mozilla and Amaya can handle simple links . Instead, the typical solution is to transform XML documents on the Web server into HTML  XHTML  or WML, which can contain links that the browser can under- stand. As an example let’s consider an integrated XML-based architecture that supports the construction of hypermedia-based Web sites from con- ceptual design to representation layer.  WebML  Web Modeling Language  was the result of a research effort under the W3I3 project, funded by the European Community. The proj- ect was driven by the requirements of two major European Web develop- ers, the German Otto-Versand, specializing in e-commerce, and the Dutch PPT  KPN , specializing in Web hosting services.  WebML addresses the high-level, platform-independent speciﬁcation of data-intensive Web applications and targets Web sites that require such advanced features as the one-to-one personalization of content and the delivery of information on multiple devices, like PCs, PDAs, digital televi- sions, and WAP phones  Ceri, Fraternali, and Bongio 2000 .  The project has also produced a supporting CASE environment called WebRatio  www.webratio.com , which covers the entire life cycle of Web applications and follows a model-driven approach to Web design, cen- tered on the use of WebML. WebML is clearly positioned for the develop- ment  of  hypermedia-based  Web  sites;  it  is  not  an  appropriate  tool  to model collaborative Web applications such as supply chains and other peer-to-peer applications. It has its roots in classic hypermedia modeling methods  such  as  HDM   Garzotto,  Paolini,  and  Schwabe  1993   and OOHDM  Rossi, Schwabe, and Lyardot 1999 . What interests us here is the  consistent  use  of  XML  from  the  conceptual  model  to  the  ﬁnished Web site, and how the navigational model can be derived from the con- ceptual model  Ceri, Fraternali, and Bongio 2000 :  WebML  enables  the  high-level  description  of  a  Web  site  under  distinct  or- thogonal dimensions: its data content  structural model , the pages that com- pose it  composition model , the topology of links between pages  navigation model , the layout and graphic requirements for page rendering  presentation model , and the customization features for one-to-one content delivery  per- sonalization model .  History of WebML  Integrated environment   278  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  Structural Model The structural model describes the information items of the site in terms of entities and relationships. WebML does not intro- duce new modeling methods, but it can collaborate with existing model- ing methods such as the classical ERM or UML class diagrams.  The structural model consists of several ENTITY elements.    ...      ...    Y  F L  Simple properties  ENTITY elements,  in  turn,  contain  ATTRIBUTE elements, COMPONENT ele- ments, and RELATIONSHIP elements as child elements.  ATTRIBUTE elements  describe  the  name  and  type  of  entity  attributes. Types are restricted to String, Text, Number, Integer, Float, Date, Boolean, Image, URL, and WebMLURL.  When WebML was created, XML Schema was still far away. WebML  therefore uses its own type system.  User-de- ﬁned enumeration types are also possible by declaring them in separate  DOMAIN elements.  E  A  M     T  Complex properties  COMPONENT elements  are  used  to  describe  complex  multivalued  types. They can contain several ATTRIBUTE elements and can specify minimum and maximum cardinality:              RELATIONSHIP elements are used to describe the relationships to other entities. They can specify the target and role of the relationship, mini- mum and maximum cardinality, and an inverse relationship:  <RELATIONSHIP id=”ProductToServiceProvider”   to=”ServiceProvider” inverse=”ServiceProviderToProduct” minCard=”1” maxCard=”1” >  Query language  In addition, WebML introduces an OQL-like query language that al- lows the speciﬁcation of derived attributes. Here is an example that com- putes a derived attribute “shippingCost” from attribute “weight”:  Team-Fly®   7.1 Hypermedia  279  <ATTRIBUTE id=”shippingCost” type=”Float”  value=”Self.weight * 3.50” >  A special case of deriving an attribute is to import an attribute from an-  other entity:  Derived attributes and relationships  <ATTRIBUTE id=”ServicePhoneNo” type=”String”  value=”Self.ServiceProviderToProduct.PhoneNo” >  “Self”  identiﬁes  the  entity  to  which  the    element  belongs. Here we imported the attribute PhoneNo from a related ServiceProvider.  With  a  similar  syntax  is  it  also  possible  to  derive  new  relationships from  existing  relationships.  Derived  relationships  can  be  important  in the navigation model for the deﬁnition of shortcuts.  Hypertext Model The hypertext model deﬁnes one or more hypertexts that can be published in the site. Each different hypertext deﬁnes a site view, which in turn consists of two submodels. The root element of the hypertext model is the SITEVIEW element.  Composition Model The composition model speciﬁes which Web pages belong to a hypertext and which content units belong to a Web page. The content units are deﬁned on top of the structural model—the designer speciﬁes how content units relate to the entities deﬁned in the structural model.  A composition model is represented by the PAGE element, which is a child of the SITEVIEW element and which identiﬁes a certain region within a hypertext. For example, a PAGE can be implemented by an HTML frame or a WML card. PAGE elements can in turn contain other page deﬁnitions or UNIT elements that refer to one of the following unit deﬁnitions.  Content units     ...                     ...      280  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  There are six types of content units: data units, multidata units, index  units, ﬁlter units, scroller units, and direct units.  Data units publish the information of a single information item  e.g., an  instance  of  an  entity  or  of  a  component .  They  can  select  speciﬁc attributes of the displayed information item:             Multidata units publish information about a set of information items  e.g., all the instances of an entity . They can contain several data units:                 Index  units  show  a  list  of  information  items.  The  INDEXUNIT element contains a DESCRIPTION element that speciﬁes the attribute from which the index list is composed:           Filter units allow a search value to be entered in order to display only the matching items. Inside a FILTERUNIT element one or several SEARCH- ATTRIBUTE elements  can  be  speciﬁed.  Each  deﬁnes  the  name  of  an attribute and a predicate such as eq, neq, gt, gteq, lt, lteq, like:       Scroller units present commands that allow navigation in a set of infor-     mation items:  <SCROLLERUNIT id=”ProductScroll” entity=”Product”  first=”yes” last=”yes”  previous=”yes” next=”yes” >   7.1 Hypermedia  281  Direct units do not display information but are used to denote a one-to-  one relationship between semantically related information items:  <DIRECTUNIT id=”ToServiceProvider”  relation=”ProductToServiceProvider” >  Navigation  Model The  navigation  model  describes  the  navigational structure of a hypertext, that is, how pages and units are linked together. This is deﬁned by links. Links lead from a source unit to a target unit. This can happen across pages. All of the previous unit elements may contain one or both of the following link elements: INFOLINK and HYPERLINK.  When used in a DATAUNIT, the link type INFOLINK carries instance infor- mation from the source to the target. The information in the target unit therefore depends on the instance in the source unit. For example:  <DATAUNIT id=”ServiceProviderData” entity=”ServiceProvider”>                   This deﬁnition would create a link within the ServiceProviderData unit that leads to the unit ProductIndex. This unit would display only those products that are related to the ServiceProvider instance shown in the ﬁrst unit.  We see that the INFOLINK element exploits the knowledge contained in the RELATIONSHIP elements in the structural model. But what if we use INFOLINK in other units?    For multidata units the context information associated with the data units nested within the multidata unit determines the content in the target unit.    For index units the key value selected from the index list determines the    For ﬁlter units the attribute values entered by the user determine the  content in the target unit.  content in the target unit.    For  scroller  units  the  identiﬁer  of  the  object  selected  by  using  the  scrolling commands determines the content in the target unit.    Direct units are treated similarly to data units.   282  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  HYPERLINK does not carry instance information from the source to the target. The information in the target unit is therefore independent of the instance in the source unit.  If we modify the previous example to  <DATAUNIT id=”ServiceProviderData” entity=”ServiceProvider”>                   the difference is that the unit ProductIndex shows all product instances.  Presentation  Model The  presentation  model  describes  the  layout  and graphic appearance  look and feel  of pages by means of an abstract XML syntax.  This  description  is  device  independent.  WebML  pages  are  ren- dered according to a style sheet.  Personalization  Model The  personalization  model  describes  users and user  groups.  These  are  modeled  explicitly  as  predeﬁned  entities  in  the structural  schema.  The  properties  of  these  entities  can  be  used  to  store user or user group preferences and other personalization data. This data can be used to construct derived attributes of other entities, in the com- position of content units, and in the deﬁnition of the presentation model. For example, a user entity contains an attribute discountRate. The en- tity product contains an attribute listPrice. With the help of an OQL- like expression we could compute a derived attribute effectivePrice for the entity product from listPrice and discountRate.  In addition to these declarative deﬁnitions, the personalization model allows procedural speciﬁcations, too, in the form of business rules that describe the reaction of the system to user interaction  clicks or text en- try  and other events.  A business rule is speciﬁed as a triple event-condition-action. When a speciﬁed event occurs, the speciﬁed condition is tested, and if the con- dition is found true, the action is performed. Typical actions triggered by a  business  rule  are  the  assignment  of  users  to  speciﬁc  user  groups  good customers, bad customers , the notiﬁcation of users  for example, in case of price changes , the logging of user actions  for data warehous- ing , and so on.  Look and feel  Users and user groups  Business rules   7.2 Topic Maps  283  Dangling pointers  7.2 TOPIC MAPS  Using hyperlinks that are embedded into documents is not really a good idea. Everybody who has surfed the Web for more than half an hour has probably come across the infamous 404 response code: a URL pointed to a  resource  that  no  longer  exists  in  the  speciﬁed  location—probably because the Web master had the brilliant idea of reorganizing the direc- tory  structure  of  his  Web  site.  Moving  resources  to  another  location requires that all URLs in all of the Web pages that point to this particular location must be updated—and by all, we mean worldwide! This usually doesn’t happen.  One solution to this problem is offered by XLink with linkbases, as dis- cussed in Section 7.1.2. Linkbases can contain all the links of a set of Web pages and thus reduce the maintenance efforts to the linkbase. When the location of a Web page changes, it is only necessary to make modiﬁca- tions to the linkbase instead of modifying each page individually. With linkbases it becomes much more likely that hyperlinks are kept in good shape.  Hyperlinks  and also hyperlinks contained in a linkbase  are links be- tween physical Web resources. Navigation through such a structure is al- most always like walking through a town without a roadmap. You can follow signposts, but only the signposts that are in your viewing range. It is easy to get lost.  Hypermedia  and  encyclopedia  editors  have  known  this  for  a  long time. Therefore they supply their users with a variety of navigational ac- cess structures: table of contents, index, guided tour, history, and so on. One of these access structures is the semantic map. Semantic maps allow users to navigate on an abstract level and then to drill down to the actual resources.  A prominent form of this is the topic map, probably one of the most important  developments  in  the  area  of  knowledge  representation  and navigation in a long time.  7.2.1 A GPS for the Web  Topic maps are an ISO standard  Biezunski, Bryan, and Newcomb 1999 . Charles Goldfarb, the father of SGML, has described topic maps as “GPS for the Web.” In fact, navigation was one of the prime design issues for topic  maps.  Topic  maps  originated  in  the  SGML  community  and  have their roots in HyTime. The standard, however, does not rely on a speciﬁc  Separate link layer  The virtues of a map   284  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  Nodes and arcs  implementation language. One implementation of the topic map stan- dard is XTM 1.0  XML Topic Maps   Biezunski and Newcomb 2000, 2001 . Like entity relationship diagrams  see Chapter 3 , topic maps consist of nodes and arcs. The difference, however, is that the nodes are “topics,” not “entities,”  and the arcs are called “associations,” not “relationships.”  There are some similarities. Compare Peter Chen’s statement:  An entity is a “thing”’ which can be distinctly identiﬁed.  to Steve Pepper’s statement  Pepper 1999 :  A topic, in its most generic sense, can be any “thing” whatsoever—a person, an entity, a concept, really anything—regardless of whether it exists or has any other speciﬁc characteristics, about which anything whatsoever may be asserted by any means whatsoever.  You cannot get much better than that. However, the similarity of these descriptions could be misleading. A topic is not equivalent to an entity. Despite the claim that topics are “things,” they actually are not. They are rather  themes  around  which  “things”  are  grouped.  ISO  speciﬁcation 13250 deﬁnes the structure of a topic map as    groupings of addressable information resources around topics  occur-  rences , and    relationships between topics  associations .  In this sense, a topic can be better compared to an entity set in Chen’s model, but in a less typed way. Topics are abstract notions such as “20th century history,” “Marilyn Monroe movies,” “Otto Preminger movies,” and so on.  Associations can relate topics to each other; for example, “20th cen- tury  history”  includes  “Marilyn  Monroe  movies.”  Unlike  the  relation- ships in ERM, associations are always bidirectional; that is, our “includes” association can be read backward as “is included by.”  What is important here is that associations are established not between the information resources but between the abstract topics. The semantic network consists only of topics and associations and can be formulated independently  from  the  underlying  base  of  information  resources.  In fact, it is possible to project a topic map onto different sets of information resources.  Let  us  look  at  an  example   see  Figures  7.4  and  7.5 .  The  same  topic map is applied onto two different sets of information resources. In Figure 7.4, the map imposes a structure onto a pool of AVI ﬁles, while in Figure 7.5, the information resources consist of HTML ﬁles. A topic map can be  Topic map deﬁned  One map, two resource pools   7.2 Topic Maps  285  20th Century History  includes  in  clu  d  e s  Otto Preminger Movies  Marilyn Monroe Movies  Exodus.avi  River of No Return.avi  Niagara.avi  Monkey Business.avi  Laura.avi  Some Like It Hot.avi  Figure 7.4 Topic map for an online video library.  imposed on such an information pool without even touching the infor- mation resources. The links between topics and information resources are all deﬁned in the topic map.  This also allows us to impose different topic maps onto the same infor-  mation pool  see Figure 7.6 .  These links can, as we see in Figures 7.4 and 7.5, establish a connec- tion between two topics. Although there is no direct association between  Two maps, one resource pool   286  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  20th Century History  includes  in  clu  d  e s  Otto Preminger Movies  Marilyn Monroe Movies  Exodus.html  River of No Return.html  Niagara.html  Monkey Business.html  Laura.html  Some Like It Hot.html  Figure 7.5 The topic map of Figure 7.4 applied to an encyclopedia.  “Marilyn Monroe movies” and “Otto Preminger movies,” a connection exists because both topics share the same information resource  River of No Return.avi in Figure 7.4, and River of No Return.html in Figure 7.5 .  Speciﬁcation 13250 states:  Two topics may be connected through an association, and they can also be connected by virtue of sharing an occurrence.   7.2 Topic Maps  287  Suspense  Comedy  Western  Exodus.html  Niagara.html  River of No Return.html  Monkey Business.html  Laura.html  Some Like It Hot.html  Figure 7.6 Alternative topic map for the encyclopedia.  Occurrence sharing  However, a topic map should not rely on occurrence sharing. Concepts should be “spelled out” by means of associations, not by occurrence shar- ing.  Otherwise,  important  aspects  of  a  concept  could  get  lost  when  a topic map is applied to a different information pool.  In our example, the connection between Otto Preminger and Marilyn Monroe  obviously  relies  on  the  presence  of  an  information  resource about River of No Return. This anomaly is due to a poor design of the se- mantic Web. A better approach would be to model each movie as a sepa- rate topic, independent of information resources. This would result in a proper topic map describing the movie world  see Figure 7.7 . This topic map is completely independent of the underlying information resources.   288  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  20th Century History  includes  in  clu  d  e s  Otto Preminger Movies  Marilyn Monroe Movies  d cte dire  directed  d cte dire  A  E  T  Exodus  Y  F L  d  i r  e  c  t  e  d  M  played_in  River of No Return  Niagara  _i n  d  e  y  p la  Monkey Business  p l a y e d _ i n p l a y e d _ i n  Laura  Some Like It Hot  Figure 7.7 The complete semantic network.  It describes the concepts completely, but it can be easily mapped onto dif- ferent information pools.  Subject deﬁned  Topics in Detail The concept of topics is closely related to the concept of a subject. XTM 1.0 deﬁnes the term subject as  . . . the organizing principle of a topic.  Team-Fly®   7.2 Topic Maps  289  It also makes the following distinction between a subject and a topic:  A topic aggregates information which shares the characteristic of being about a given subject. In other words, the subject is the ineffable thing which is at the heart of a topic.  Steve Pepper  2000  puts it a bit more philosophically:  We might think of a “subject” as corresponding to what Plato called an idea. A topic, on the other hand, is like the shadow that the idea casts on the wall of Plato’s cave: It is an object within a topic map that represents a subject.  Any topic represents a subject, and a subject is represented by exactly one topic. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that more than one topic deﬁnition represents the same subject, for example, when the same sub- ject is represented in different topic maps or in different sections of the same topic map. Let us return to Plato’s cave: an idea can have multiple shadows if there are multiple light sources.  Therefore there must be a way to establish the identity of topic deﬁni-  Topic identity  tions that represent the same subject. There are two ways to do this:    Topics are identical if they have the same baseName  see below  and the  same scope.    Topics are identical if they refer to the same published subject indicator  PSI . This allows us to establish the identity of subjects across topic maps, and even across Web sites. A published subject indicator repre- sents each published subject with a unique URI.  A similar technique to obtain globally unique identiﬁers is used for XML namespaces.   Let’s now look at XTM topics in detail. Within the XTM 1.0 DTD, a  topic is deﬁned by  <!ELEMENT topic  instanceOf*,subjectIdentity?, baseNameoccurrence * >  Topic element  The ﬁrst element instanceOf classiﬁes the topic. A topic can belong to one or multiple topic classes. Topic classes deﬁne a type for each topic. A topic class itself can be deﬁned as another topic  so it is possible to link information resources to it and to include it in associations . Also pub- lished  subject  indicators  can  act  as  topic  classes.  This  is  especially  true when  no  instanceOf deﬁnition  is  supplied.  In  this  case  the  topic  type defaults to a predeﬁned top-level published subject indicator “topic”:   http:  www.topicmaps.org xtm 1.0 psi-topic   In  our  example,  all  movie  topics  such  as  “River  of  No  Return”,  “Some Like It Hot”, and so on could be instances of a parent topic “movie”.   290  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  The second  optional  element subjectIdentity deﬁnes a unique sub- ject  identity  point for  the  topic  and  thus  establishes  the  topic’s  subject identity.  subjectIdentity is  either   1   a  reference  to  an  information resource,  2  a reference to a published subject indicator  see above , or  3  a reference to another topic. In the ﬁrst case, the speciﬁed resource is the subject of the topic. In the second case, the speciﬁed PSI identiﬁes the subject. In the third case, the identity is inherited from the topic pointed at, and both topics will merge.  This  last  technique  allows  the  introduction  of  short  names  for  the  lengthy PSIs:        <subjectIndicatorRef xlink:href=  “http:  www.cine.org  preminger river_of_no_return” >        With this deﬁnition in place it is now sufﬁcient to refer to topic “ronr” whenever we want to refer to the subject with identity “http:  www.cine .org preminger river_of_no_return”.  The element baseName deﬁnes a name for the topic in natural language. A  topic  may  have  none,  one,  or  several  baseNames.  Base  names  can  be constrained by a scope element that declares the base name valid only within a speciﬁed context such as a speciﬁc language, geographical area, or historical period.  Topics with the same base name and the same scope will merge.   For each baseName it is possible to deﬁne an arbitrary number of variant elements  e.g., for display or for sort purposes . The deﬁnition of variants is recursive, so you can have variants of variants, and so on.  Finally the occurrence elements deﬁne all the occurrences to informa- tion resources. Occurrences can also have a scope deﬁning the context in which  they  are  valid.  Occurrences  can  have  a  type   only  one   that  is deﬁned through their instanceOf child element. This type deﬁnition de- ﬁnes the role of the occurrence.  If no instanceOf type deﬁnition is sup- plied, the type of the occurrence defaults to a predeﬁned top-level PSI “occurrence”.   Occurrences can also possess  only one  baseName. Processors can use this base name to display a label for a link to a resource. The linked infor- mation resource is usually given in the form of an xlink: reference, but it can also be supplied in the form of literal data.   7.2 Topic Maps  291  Let’s now look at an example of a topic deﬁnition:                       River of No Return                <resourceRef xlink:href=             “ftp:  www.movielib.com western preminger no_return.avi” >       <resourceRef xlink:href=  “ftp:  www.clops.com preminger-no_return.html” >        In this example we have deﬁned two occurrences for the topic “River of No  Return”  with  different  roles  “video-avi-format”  and  “html-online- description”, mapping the topic into both information pools. Both roles “video-avi-format”  and  “html-online-description”  would  be  deﬁned  as topics,  too.  This  would  allow  us  to  link  information  resources  to  each role, for example, describing how to use these particular data formats.  Associations Associations are deﬁned as     The ﬁrst element instanceOf again speciﬁes a class  or type  to which the associations belong. This means that associations can also be typed. Asso- ciation classes are either topics themselves or published subject indicators.  Association elements   292  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  Modular maps  Associations can be constrained by a scope element that declares the association  valid  only  within  a  speciﬁed  context  such  as  a  speciﬁc  do- main, version language, geographical area, or historical period. Scopes are deﬁned as references to another topic, to an information resource, or to a published subject indicator.  Finally, member elements deﬁne the items that participate in the associ- ation. That can be topics, information resources, or published subject in- dicators. Each member deﬁnition can comprise a role speciﬁcation, that is, a reference to another topic or published subject indicator representing the role. Also possible are n-ary associations, with n > 2.  Merging Maps The concept of topic identity allows the merging of topic maps. This is an important aspect because it allows separate work groups to develop sepa- rate topic maps and then to merge them. Also, in the case of company mergers or when establishing a virtual company, it will be necessary to merge  semantic  networks,  for  example,  to  merge  thesauri  for  product descriptions and so on.  Also possible is the modular development of topic maps and the reuse of such modules. In Figure 7.8 we have modularized our example topic map by slicing it into two layers. The top layer deﬁnes the semantic net- work, while the lower layers do only the mapping of the topics to their respective information resources.  The  merging  of  topic  maps  is  accomplished  through  the  mergeMap  element:  <!ELEMENT mergeMap  <!ATTLIST mergeMap   topicRefresourceRefsubjectIndicatorRef  * >  id              ID        IMPLIED xlink:type      NMTOKEN   FIXED ‘simple’ xlink:href      CDATA     REQUIRED   >  The xlink:href attribute  of  mergeMap points  to  the  topic  map  to  be merged into the current map. The mergeMap element can be used recur- sively; that is, a map that is merged in via a mergeMap element can contain mergeMap elements itself.  The mergeMap element  can  contain  a  child  element  deﬁning  one  or more  scopes  for  the  map  merged  in.  These  scopes  are  deﬁned  as  refer- ences either to another topic, to an information resource, or to a pub- lished subject indicator.   7.2 Topic Maps  293  20th Century History  includes  in  clu  d  e s  Otto Preminger Movies  Marilyn Monroe Movies  d cte dire  directed  d cte dire  d  i r  e  c  t  e  d  played_in  River of No Return  p l a y e d _ i n p l a y e d _ i n  Exodus  Niagara  _i n  d  e  y  p la  Monkey Business  Laura  Some Like It Hot   a   Niagara  Laura  Laura  River of No Return  River of No Return  Niagara  Exodus  Monkey Business  Exodus  Monkey Business  Some Like It Hot  Some Like It Hot  River of No Return.avi  River of No Return.html  Exodus.avi  Niagara.avi  Exodus.html  Niagara.html  Monkey Business.avi  Monkey Business.html  Laura.avi  Some Like It Hot.avi  Laura.html  Some Like It Hot.html   b    c   Figure 7.8 Using the merge facility of topic maps to abstract the semantic network from concrete resources.  a  This topic map deﬁnes only a semantic network. It can be applied to an information pool by merging it with one of the other topic maps.  b  This topic map maps only the topics from the semantic network to our video library.  c  This one does the same for the encyclopedia.   294  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  Annotating resources  Attaching Properties to Resources ISO speciﬁcation 13250 deﬁnes for topic maps the concept of facets. A facet is a property that can be attached to an information resource from the  outside,  without  modifying  the  information  resource  itself.  This  is similar to RDF’s capability to make statements about resources without modifying  the  resource.  However,  facets  have  been  dropped  from  the XTM  speciﬁcation.  In  XTM  an  information  resource  is  also  a  topic  by default. It is relatively easy to attach a property to a resource, so there is no need for an extra mechanism.  In the next example we do exactly this. We deﬁne a topic that has as  subject the resource  “ftp:  www.movielib.com western preminger no_return.avi”.  Using  an  occurrence  element,  we  attach  a  name value   baseName   resourceData  pair saying that the movie will be screened soon:  <topic id=”ftp:  www.movielib.com western preminger no_return.avi”>   <resourceRef xlink:href= “ftp:  www.movielib.com western preminger no_return.avi” >         Availability        To be screened soon           Applications Topic maps are ideally suited for structuring complex knowledge bases and thesauri. They enable semantically driven navigation between infor- mation  items,  semantically  driven  automatic  layout  of  Web  and  help pages, and so on.  7.2.2 Another Philosophical Excursus As we have seen, topic maps make a clear distinction between informa- tion resources and topics. While the information resources represent the   7.2 Topic Maps  295  Aristotle again  Classiﬁcation  Attributes  Relationships  entities in an information system, the topics refer to subjects that exist independently of a particular information system. The concept of sub- jects has its foundation in the theory of substance, formulated over 2,000 years ago by Aristotle.  Substances  exist  on  their  own,  they  keep  their  identity  throughout their life span and their life span is continuous through time, they are “one”  i.e., they do not consist of other substances and cannot belong to another  substance ,  they  have  a  complete  and  determinate  boundary, and they take up space and are spatially connected  Smith 1998 .  Substances can be classiﬁed. Classiﬁcation introduces higher-level sub- stances—second-order substances—such as apple, computer, desk, and so on. These are abstract notions referring to real instances: a particular ap- ple, computer, desk, and so on  Partridge 2000 .  Substances have attributes, but attributes are never substances. A cat may have a smile, but  if we forget Lewis Carroll for a moment  there isn’t a smile without a cat. For a ﬁrst-order substance, attributes are con- crete. For example, my computer screen has a screen size of 17 inches, no more, no less. For a second-order substance such as “computer screen,” the  value  “screen  size”  may  be  undeﬁned;  it  may,  however,  be  con- strained to a certain value domain, say 15 to 22 inches. For other second- order substances, such as “17-inch computer screen,” the value may be well deﬁned.  Attributes such as “screen size” can apply to various substances, for ex- ample, to computer screens, television screens, projector screens, and so on. This encourages us to classify attributes independently from the sub- stances hierarchy. Thus we arrive at second-order attributes, such as “color,” “size,”  “weight,”  “complexity,”  “price,”  and  so  on.  These  second-order attributes are not concrete  although their values may be constrained to a certain domain , nor do they belong to a particular ﬁrst- or second-order substance.  Substances can be related. In the substance-attribute model, relation- ships can be assigned to substances as attributes. However, this poses a problem. Most relationships are bidirectional; for instance, the relation- ship “Lewis Carroll wrote Alice in Wonderland” implies the reverse rela- tionship “Alice in Wonderland was written by Lewis Carroll.” Aristotle was well aware of this problem:  All relatives have their correlatives. “Slave” means the slave of a master, and “master”  in  turn  implies  slave.  “Double”  means  double  of  its  half,  just  as “half” means half of its double. By “greater,” again, we mean greater than this or that thing which is less, by “less” less than that which is greater. So it is with all relative terms.   296  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  Similarities  Differences  This  concept  of  correlatives,  however,  introduces  redundancies  be- cause a relation between two substances is here described twice—once for each substance. For many-to-many relationships, things get completely out of hand.  As we saw earlier, topic maps take a different approach. Relations  or “associations” as relations are called in the context of topic maps  are de- ﬁned as separate items, not as properties. Associations are always bidirec- tional, so topic maps do not introduce the previously mentioned redun- dancy. This is quite in contrast to RDF.  7.2.3 Topic Maps versus RDF  Both topic maps and RDF are designed to model semantic networks. Both use the same paradigm to do this: graphs consisting of nodes and arcs. In the deﬁnition of ontologies, both fall short by not offering language ele- ments for the deﬁnition of constraints.  What  now  are  the  differences  between  topic  maps  and  RDF?  As  the name says, the main organizing principle for topic maps is topics. It is possible  to  deﬁne  complete  topic  maps  without  even  talking  about  re- sources. If resources are present, topic maps construct links from known semantics to resources. In contrast, for RDF the main organizing principle is resources. RDF constructs pointers from existing resources to known se- mantics. Semantic networks are constructed on the basis of existing re- sources. We could say that topic maps work top down, while RDF works bottom up.  Also, a topic map intentionally deﬁnes a whole semantic network. In practice, a semantic network, however, could be deﬁned by several topic maps and the resulting semantic network obtained by merging them. In contrast, an RDF description intentionally makes statements about a sin- gle resource. The semantic network is formed by the RDF statements de- ﬁned in a given domain. Ultimately the whole Internet becomes one se- mantic web.  Topic maps therefore lend themselves better to a client-server environ- ment. Typically topic maps are found in knowledge servers and content management systems, and they are used to structure a clearly bounded information base. RDF is designed to support open environments. It can support  navigational  systems   e.g.,  search  engines,  agents,  etc.   and  is posed to convert the Web into a huge knowledge base.  The “closed system” approach of topic maps has advantages and dis- advantages. It can be expected that the deﬁnition of a topic map is more consistent than a collection of RDF statements that are possibly made by   7.3 Directory Services  UDDI   297  different  people,  at  different  times,  in  different  places.  On  the  other hand,  a  topic  map  can  quickly  become  outdated  and  needs  constant maintenance by its author. This is beautifully shown by an example topic map published on the Internet: the map lists all free XML tools on the Web. By the time this topic map was published, it was probably already out-of-date. With RDF the deﬁnition of a semantic network would be in- cremental. Every time a new XML tool is published, corresponding RDF statements can be published as well.  RDF is a low-level language. Modeling a knowledge base in RDF can re- sult in a huge and unwieldy collection of RDF statements. In contrast, topic  maps  provide  a  much  more  structured  approach  to  the  task  of knowledge modeling: topic maps are more problem oriented.  RDF allows second-order constructs by reifying RDF statements into RDF  resources.  Topic  maps  do  not  provide  such  a  possibility;  associa- tions cannot be treated as topics  i.e., it is not possible to deﬁne associa- tions about associations . This restricts the expressiveness of topic maps somewhat.  7.3 DIRECTORY SERVICES  UDDI   Directory services are to computers what the Yellow or White Pages are to humans. They contain the addresses of people, organizations, and other resources. Service providers that have a service to offer can publish their service in a directory. Clients that require a certain service can search a directory for that service.  The Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration  UDDI  speciﬁ- cations deﬁne a way to publish and discover information about Web ser- vices  UDDI 2000 . UDDI is a joint initiative of Ariba, IBM, and Microsoft. The companies involved in the deﬁnition of the standard are committed to providing free directory services based on UDDI to the public.  The  information  stored  in  a  UDDI  registry  consists  of  three  components:    White Pages contain the addresses, contact information, and identiﬁers    Yellow Pages categorize services along industrial categorizations based  of businesses and services.  on standard taxonomies.    Green  Pages contain  technical  information  about  the  advertised  ser- vices,  including  references  to  further  documentation  and  discovery mechanisms.   298  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  UDDI is designed for the discovery of technical features of a service or of a business. It is not designed for discovery queries such as “Give me the supplier of toothbrushes with the lowest price,” or “Find the brass factory closest to New Orleans.” Such queries can be answered by services such as marketplaces or business portals; these services rely on UDDI to locate only the Web services that are technically ﬁt to satisfy the request.  Here is a simple UDDI request searching for a business name:                    Microsoft      Y  F L  UDDI requests  in bold  must be wrapped into a SOAP envelope; the pre- scribed encoding is UTF-8.  A UDDI query like this one would be answered with a list of businesses  and services that match the speciﬁed business name  Lovett 2000 :  E  <businessList generic=”1.0” operator=”Microsoft Corporation”   truncated=”false” xmlns=”urn:uddi-org:api”>  T  M  A    <businessInfo  businessKey=”0076B468-EB27-42E5-AC09-9955CFF462A3”>   Microsoft Corporation    ...     <serviceInfo  businessKey=”0076B468-EB27-42E5-AC09-9955CFF462A3” serviceKey=”1FFE1F71-2AF3-45FB-B788-09AF7FF151A4”>  Web services for smart searching     ...       ...        Team-Fly®   7.3 Directory Services  UDDI   299  UUIDs  UDDI registry  As you can see businesses and services are identiﬁed via businessKey and serviceKey attributes whose values are given as UUIDs  universally unique identiﬁers . Further queries may use these identiﬁers to drill down in the information structure and get details about the services, for exam- ple. This type of identiﬁcation used in UDDI should be well known to COM and DCE programmers. The initiators of UDDI  probably chose this form  of  identiﬁcation  because  this  way  it  is  easier  to  leverage  existing naming service and registry  implementations for UDDI. UUIDs are glob- ally unique and have some advantages over domain-name-based identi- ﬁers. They can be easily computed without the help of a central registry instance, and they don’t depend on a physical location. However, to the human eye, they appear inscrutable.  Information in a UDDI registry is stored in XML format. It contains much more information than businessInfos and ServiceInfos  Boubez et al. 2000 .  There are four main groups:    Business information: The top-level element to store information about a business is the BusinessEntity element. It contains details such as the business name, business identiﬁer, address, contact information, and optional elements for categorization.    Service information: The business information for services is contained in  the  BusinessService elements,  which  are  child  elements  of  the BusinessEntity element.  These  elements  contain  the  service  name, identiﬁer, and optional elements for categorization.    Binding information: Technical data such as the address of the service  e.g., a URL  or routing options is contained in the bindingTemplate el- ement, a child element of the BusinessService element. This element also contains pointers to technical speciﬁcations.    Interface information: A client process that wants to use a service not only needs the address of the service, but also has to know how to in- terface with the service. This interface is described in a tModel element. A bindingTemplate  see  above   can  reference  a  tModel.  A  tModel de- scribes a speciﬁcation. It contains the name, the publishing organiza- tion, identiﬁers and optional elements for categorization, and a URL pointer to the actual speciﬁcation. Such a speciﬁcation would describe the wire protocol, the interchange format, and interchange sequencing rules. Examples for such speciﬁcations are found in standards such as RosettaNet, ebXML, or the various EDI standards.  A tModel thus  acts  as  a  kind  of  ﬁngerprint  for  an  interface  speci- ﬁcation.  Companies  that  agree  on  a  tModel can  be  sure  that  their   300  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  Business identiﬁers  Business categories  Taxonomies  Napster  Gnutella  exchange formats are compatible without having to look deeper into the interface speciﬁcation.  Both BusinessEntity and tModel elements  can  contain  additional identiﬁers.  Typical  identiﬁers  for  businesses  include  Dun  &  Bradstreet  D-U-N-S  numbers,  tax  identiﬁers,  or  any  other  kind  of  organizational identiﬁers. The purpose of these identiﬁers is to allow others to ﬁnd pub- lished information through these more formal identiﬁers.  As we have seen, BusinessEntity elements, BusinessService elements, and tModel elements may contain information for categorization. Cate- gorization associates these elements with industry codes, product or ser- vice categories, or regional classiﬁcation. Categories can be chosen from deﬁned taxonomies. This category information can be used for searches in the Yellow or Green Pages.  Three taxonomies are predeﬁned in UDDI operator registry sites: the North  American  Industry  Classiﬁcation  System   NAICS ,  the  Universal Standard  Products  and  Services  Classiﬁcation   UNSPSC ,  and  a  geo- graphic taxonomy.  Both  category  taxonomies  and  identiﬁcation  systems  can  be  repre- sented by tModels, too. tModel references can therefore be used for cate- gorization and identiﬁcation purposes. Operator registry sites provide a number of useful tModels, including U.S. tax codes, NAICS, UNSPSC, and a geographic taxonomy.  7.4 PEER-TO-PEER ARCHITECTURES  Peer-to-peer  P2P  architectures have recently received a lot of publicity, especially in the Napster controversy. Napster offered its users a directory service for MP3 song titles. Users interested in a song would source it with the  help  of  this  directory.  The  directory  would  point  them  to  another user  who  owns  a  copy   but  not  the  copyright   of  the  song.  He  or  she could then download the song directly from the computer of this user, provided this user was online. Although the exchange of the MP3 ﬁles worked on a P2P basis—from user to user—ﬁnding the location of a ﬁle relied on the central Napster directory. This was where Napster was vul- nerable, and the music industry won a court case against Napster forcing them to remove millions of titles from the directory.  While this technology is not really new in electronic business—ﬁnding a service in a directory and then using it is a well-known technique in component-based architectures such as CORBA—things become more in- teresting when we look at Napster’s competitors. Gnutella and others are   7.4 Peer-to-Peer Architectures  301  not as vulnerable as Napster was: they don’t use a central directory. Here’s how they do it.  After installing the software, you must ﬁnd a Gnutella site that is al- ready operating. That may be a friend or some advertised site. In the fu- ture you will only communicate with this partner site  or, if you selected several sites, with these sites . If you are searching for a ﬁle, your Gnutella client will issue a request to your direct partners. Either they will be able to satisfy your request, or they will forward the request to all the sites they are connected with. And so on. Once a ﬁle is found, its address is passed back from site to site—like the famous bucket—until you get it. You can then download it from its original location. To avoid a request circling around, each request has a unique identiﬁer, and each node on the way keeps a log of the requests it has already forwarded. This enables these nodes to prune out circling requests.  This all works well in a small community. But if the population of the network goes into the millions, your request is replicated a million times. It will even be replicated in some areas of the network after you have al- ready received the ﬁle you wanted! And this is the effect of a single query. If a million users issue queries at the same time, the consequences are ob- vious: the network goes down. Gnutella solves this by introducing an ag- ing process for queries. A query dies after it has been replicated a speciﬁed number of times. This restricts network trafﬁc to tolerable amounts but limits the horizon of a query, so a ﬁle might not be found even if it exists somewhere in the network.  Some  of  these  performance  issues  are  addressed  by  a  new  develop- ment, Freenet. The objectives of Freenet are, however, different. Its goals are to guarantee freedom of speech, not freedom of copyright infringe- ment. It does so by anonymizing and replicating ﬁles, making it impos- sible to destroy a ﬁle or to track its origin.  Freenet answers the request for a ﬁle not with the address of the re- quested ﬁle but with the ﬁle itself. This means that the ﬁle travels all the way  down  from  the  place  where  it  was  found  until  it  reaches  the  re- quester. A copy of the ﬁle is kept resident on each node it passes.  Nodes may, however, decide not to store a copy.  After some time it will expire if it was not requested again. Each node acts as a cache. The effect is that popular ﬁles are kept almost anywhere, so requests don’t have to travel far to ﬁnd such a ﬁle. A side effect is that sites that produce popular ma- terial don’t have to buy into expensive server equipment. The delivery process is “outsourced.”  In  addition,  Freenet  uses  another  search  strategy.  When  a  client  re- ceives  a  request  it  cannot  satisfy,  it  will  not  forward  the  request  to  all  Freenet   302  Chapter 7 Navigation and Discovery  connected clients but will forward it to a single peer only. If the response of that peer is negative, it will continue with the next peer.  It will start with the peer that had the most hits in the past.  This depth-ﬁrst strategy avoids the unnecessary query replication of Gnutella. Freenet, therefore, scales  much  better,  but  it  has  some  problems  of  its  own.  Currently, Freenet  does  not  support  free  text  searches.  Even  if  it  would,  users couldn’t be sure that the version they have found is the most recent ver- sion. It may be an outdated copy residing somewhere between requester and submitter. Document authors are therefore well advised to include a pointer to the most recent version of the document in the document it- self  a standard practice, for example, in W3C documents . But then— wouldn’t one goal of Freenet get lost: anonymity?  Apart from those teething problems, these early P2P implementations may perhaps indicate the future direction of the Web. More recent imple- mentations are ﬁle-sharing programs such as Morpheus. Microsoft is ac- tively researching a serverless symbiotic distributed ﬁle system under the code name FarSite based on peer-to-peer technology.  So,  central  directories  could  become  almost  extinct,  as  did  the operator-controlled telephone exchange. White and Yellow Pages? Well, some  of  the  largest  cities  in  the  world  have  done  without  them  for decades. P2P ﬁts well into the nonplanned settlement of the Internet.   8Presentation Formats  8.1  Presentation and Representation  8.2 Viewing XML Data  on the Web  8.3 User Interaction  with XForms  8.4  Exchanging Information through WAP Devices  8.5 Graphical and  Multimedia Presentation with XML  8.6 Document-Based  Type Setting  Up to this point, we have discussed XML as a represen-  tation format for managing and interchanging struc-  tured data. We have said nothing so far about how we are  able to view XML-based data on typical front-end devices.   In this chapter we will give an overview of several formats  for  presenting  XML  data,  with  a  focus  on  Web  and  multi-  media applications. First, we will discuss the attributes of data  formats  that  serve  representational  and  presentational  pur-  poses. We will base our discussion on results from multimedia  research.  Dealing with several formats is of interest to multipurpose  Web  publishing—providing  Web  publishers  with  a  means  to present  content  on  a  range  of  client  systems,  such  as  browsers,  mobile  devices  like  PDAs,  and  even  phones.  The  303   304  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  current standardization effort will help to provide this ability. Challenges to be solved include device independence, reusability of content, and encodings that meet the limitations presented by network transfer capabilities. The W3C has made important recommendations—and more are expected—about sev- eral formats, including HTML, XML, and CSS. All of them will be considered in this chapter.  8.1 PRESENTATION AND REPRESENTATION  Information system tasks  When dealing with arbitrary data in today’s information systems, there are ﬁve tasks that must be supported by computer systems:    The creation or deﬁnition of data   The processing or manipulation of data   The storage of that data   The exchange of data   The presentation of data to end users  Although each of these tasks may need a particular data format, we may reduce our discussion to exactly two classes of data formats: presentation and representation formats.  Data formats encompass both content and descriptive data. Content is the information that a user wants to have processed by a computer sys- tem; descriptive data deﬁnes the context that is necessary for the com- puter system to deal with that data appropriately. Since we have identi- ﬁed ﬁve tasks to be supported by computer systems, we may ﬁnd that descriptive data or metadata differs from task to task. Therefore several formats are necessary to hold that particular metadata.   8.1.1 Results from Multimedia Research  That this book deals with multimedia is not very surprising. First, there is a requirement to enrich Web applications with more sophisticated media than just text. Later in this chapter, we will present XML-related solutions to  multimedia   re presentation  techniques.  Second,  some  fundamental considerations for multimedia also apply in the XML ﬁeld. Although our discussion may appear somewhat academic, the properties to be identi- ﬁed may be helpful in evaluating XML developments. So we decided to give a little room to this topic.  Data formats  XML and multimedia   8.1 Presentation and Representation  305  What Is Multimedia? In the early 1990s, multimedia was the buzzword for application systems and user interface design. Multimedia is the computer-based combination of different media elements  e.g., text, graphics, video, and music . Text and graphics are visual. Music is auditory. Video is a combination of both visual and auditory elements.  Another  way  to  categorize  different  media  is  their  appearance  over time. Text and graphics don’t change; video and music do. The former are static or time independent; the latter are dynamic or time dependent. A multi- media show can encompass both static and dynamic media elements.  Another aspect of multimedia is that some means are required to de- scribe the presentation and to specify the representation of media and ap- plications. Presentation deals with the problem of how to present a show to the viewer  eventually independent of the client platform . Represen- tation deals with management and storage problems  on the server side, if we are speaking about distributed multimedia services realized through a  client-server  architecture .  A  lot  of  research  has  attempted  to  answer these different questions.  From Multimedia to the Web Two  areas  may  be  identiﬁed  in  multimedia  research:  stand-alone  ap- plications  e.g., on terminal systems or on CD-ROMs  and applications in distributed  environments   usually  on  two-  or  three-tier  client-server architectures .  A multimedia show must be deﬁned in an appropriate format  i.e., a scripting language format or an output format produced by an authoring tool . This format will describe the spatial and temporal relationships be- tween the media objects incorporated into the multimedia show. For the purpose of reuse, we can store the media objects separately from the de- scription of the show, and eventually on different nodes in the distrib- uted environment  for example, each node could be dedicated to store one type of media object . Video servers and image databases are exam- ples of such nodes as part of a computer network.  As stated earlier, multimedia, in a narrow sense, is the combination of several media types in a computer-based application, which usually is or- ganized into documents. Hypertext is characterized by the ability to nav- igate inside and between documents, as long as the application just deals with text. Gopher, a predecessor of the Web, is a hypertext-based system. Integrating both hypertext and multimedia gives us hypermedia.  Hypermedia systems or applications encompass media elements of sev- eral different types and provide the end user with navigational function-  Deﬁnition of multimedia  Media types  Multimedia shows  Hypertext  Hypermedia   306  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  Text  Text  Anchor  Web-based applications  Sound  Video  Image  Node  Link  Figure 8.1 Media integration and navigation in hypermedia presentations.  ality. Navigation is typically realized by adding links to be followed from one  informational  chunk  to  the  next,  often  located  in  different  docu- ments  see Figure 8.1 . In what follows, we will not differentiate between multimedia and hypermedia.  Web-based applications are characterized by the features that we just outlined  i.e., media integration and navigation as one form of user inter- action . Although early applications were based on HTML, and therefore limited to text and graphics, authors today have access to more advanced technologies and features. These may have been developed to fulﬁll the requirements  of  speciﬁc  applications,  such  as  mobile  business,  or  they may rely on general-purpose speciﬁcations.

Problem layers  In Web-based applications, we face three problem layers:   8.1 Presentation and Representation  307  Virtual depth  8.1.2 Dimensions of Multimedia Composition Multimedia applications are composed of media elements that consume either  space  or  time  or  both  when  presented  to  the  user.  Therefore  a multimedia programmer has to deal with both spatial and temporal com- position. For example, media elements must be positioned on the screen, in a window, or on a stage, when using the Macromedia Director author- ing tool. The programmer must also deal with interaction elements and the actions associated with them.  Spatial Composition The spatial composition of visual media objects is essential to the appear- ance  of  the  multimedia  show.  Positioning  occurs  in  three  spatial  di- mensions.  Although  a  computer  screen  is  two-dimensional,  the  third dimension  becomes  obvious  when  one  media  object  overlays  another. That way the screen is given virtual depth.  Take Figure 8.2 as a simple example. Two visual objects may each be positioned  relative  to  the  origin,  which  is  the  upper-left  corner  of  the screen. This is called absolute positioning. Alternatively we may set objects into a spatial relation, just as the rectangle has been positioned relative to the center point of the circle in Figure 8.2 b . This procedure is called relative positioning.  The positions of the objects in absolute positioning are given by the coordinates  x, y . In relative positioning, we use the difference of the co- ordinates, for example,  x – 3, y + 1 .   0,0    0,0    4,2    4,2    1,3    1,3    a    b   Figure 8.2 Positioning of spatial data objects in multimedia shows:  a  absolute positioning;  b  relative positioning.   308  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  Interaction The presentational ﬂow may be inﬂuenced by user interaction. For that purpose visual interaction elements are deﬁned and integrated into the multimedia  presentation.  Using  an  interaction  object  will  result  in  the performance  of  an  action  associated  with  that  interaction  object.  In multimedia research, interaction falls into one of the following categories:    Scaling actions change the appearance of a presentation  e.g., the size of  the windows that the presentation is performed in .    Film  actions  change  the  direction  or  speed  of  the  presentation   e.g., start, stop, forward, backward, and so on . These features are familiar from VCRs or similar electronic devices.    Choices inﬂuence the ﬂow of the presentation: the user may choose a certain information branch and thus take an individual path through the informational landscape deﬁned within the authored frame.   Y  F L  Since interaction objects are visual, they consume space and are sub-  ject to the mechanisms outlined in the context of spatial composition.  M  Temporal Composition What we have said about spatial composition also holds for the temporal positioning of dynamic or time-dependent media objects, as shown in Figure  8.3.  Temporal  composition  can  be  either  absolute   usually  mea- sured against the starting point of a presentation  or relative.  T  A  number  of  common  relationships  in  temporal  composition  have been formulated. For example, in Allen’s time calculus  Allen 1983 , there are seven temporal relationships: before, meets, overlaps, ﬁnishes, during, starts, and equals. Each, except for equals, has an inverse relationship.  A  E  Text  Image  Text  Video  t1  t2 t3  t4  t  Figure 8.3 Absolute and relative temporal composition.  Team-Fly®   8.1 Presentation and Representation  309  Interval-based and point-based representation  Intramedia and intermedia representation  The representation used in Figure 8.3 is called a timeline model. It has the same  expressiveness  as  Allen’s  time  calculus:  both  can  be  transformed into the other without any loss.  This equivalence between the interval-based and point-based represen- tations of time can easily be seen when mapping the starting and end points  of  intervals  to  time  axes  and  giving  time  stamps  to  the  points. Then the temporal aspects can be expressed using Allen’s calculus. Wahl and Rothermehl  1994  and Little  1994  give overviews of the represen- tation of time.  Synchronization When  incorporating  time-dependent  media   e.g.,  sound  and  video  se- quences   into  a  multimedia  presentation,  the  temporal  requirements have to be met at presentation time.   Synchronization  mechanisms  can  affect  single  media  objects   intra- media synchronization  or the relationship between two or more media ob- jects  intermedia synchronization .  Another dimension in synchronization is coarse- versus ﬁne-grained. Coarse-grained synchronization handles the starting and ending points of one or more presentation intervals. Fine-grained synchronization han- dles the temporal relationship within presentation intervals.  Consider a video sequence and its corresponding soundtrack. First, the start of both objects has to be controlled. Second, the difference between the two timelines must stay within certain acceptable bounds.  Of course, in distributed environments the control of temporal deﬁni- tions at presentation time is closely related to Quality of Service  QoS  parameters,  which  may  also  be  incorporated  into  representations  of multimedia applications. But we will not consider this aspect in further detail here.  8.1.3 The Advantage of Audiovisual Information  Web-based applications have been driven from the business perspective by sales and marketing goals  commerce  and also by learning training goals, so we will say a few words regarding the psychological aspects of the processing of information. In this section we will focus on the efﬁ- ciency of conveying information through presentations based on a tech- nical environment such as the Internet.   One area of multimedia research is determining to what extent multi- media techniques inﬂuence the ability of the user to recall information. This  includes  the  combination  of  media  types  as  well  as  the  power  of   310  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  Increased information reception  Data models and formats  OO multimedia composition  interaction.  The  underlying  mechanisms  are  the  same  for  both  Web- based applications and stand-alone multimedia applications.   Jeffcoate and Templeton  1992  measured the efﬁciency of the recep- tion of information. They found that a person receives 10% of visual in- formation, 20% of audio information, and 50% of audiovisual informa- tion. Other studies have slightly different results, but they support the hypothesis that the combination of both visual information  such as text and  graphics   and  audio  information   such  as  spoken  text  and  sound  will increase the efﬁciency of information transmission. An even better effect can be obtained by involving the user, as is the case with interac- tive elements.  These results may be an additional motivation for integrating multi- media information into Web-based environments, at least for a set of ap- plications. One approach in that direction is outlined in the following section.  8.1.4 Multimedia Data Models  All functions of multimedia hypermedia systems, as they have been char- acterized  before,  rely  on  the  availability  of  appropriate  data  models implemented with corresponding formats. Data formats may be differen- tiated into several hierarchical interchange categories: general containers such as ASN.1 or Bento; monomedia for graphics, video, and others  e.g., JPEG or MPEG ; metalanguages; and special-purpose object containers for data interchange on an object-oriented basis. We will shortly introduce HyTime and MHEG as representatives of metalanguages and object con- tainers, respectively.  Data interchange is normally performed through APIs in multimedia systems for application interchange, for storing and archiving in ﬁle sys- tems  or  database  systems,  and  for  presentation  in  networked  environ- ments. The last aspect, of course, is of special interest in our context.  MHEG While  monomedia  formats  just  specify  single  media  elements  for  the purpose  of  interchange,  the  deﬁnition  of  structural  information  is  the objective of the Multimedia Hypermedia Information Encoding Group  MHEG . Structural information describes the interrelationships between the different pieces of multimedia presentations.  The  MHEG  format  deﬁnes  an  object-oriented  model  for  composing multimedia  presentations.  MH-Object  is  considered  the  root  of  the MHEG class hierarchy  see Figure 8.4 . MHEG is intended for the inter-   8.1 Presentation and Representation  311  MH-Object  NULL  Script  Component  Link  Macro  Descriptor  Composite  Interaction  Content  Visual  Temporal  Audible  Numerical  Text  Graphics  Still  Video  Audio  Figure 8.4 Example of an MHEG class hierarchy  Koegel 1992 .  Audiovisual  change  of  ﬁnal-form  presentations;  that  is,  it  supports  delivery  rather than authoring.  The  MHEG  classes  provide  abstractions  and  inheritance  rules.  The standard does not specify methods that would deﬁne actions on the ob- jects. The ﬁrst part of the MHEG standard gives a formal speciﬁcation of the data structures using the ISO notation ASN.1. MHEG objects are then instances of the classes created to compose a multimedia presentation.  To perform a presentation on a target platform, MHEG objects and me- dia elements have to be transmitted from their origin. Therefore an addi- tional transfer syntax is needed. The presentation is shown to a user via an MHEG engine that interprets the MHEG object and reconstructs the structure of the multimedia composition.  Further elements of the MHEG model are the content data  i.e., the pieces of information given by text, graphics, and so on , the behavior  i.e., the actions that reﬂect the appearance of the presentation regarding the temporal and spatial relationships , and user interaction  i.e., choos- ing from alternatives or modifying data through entry ﬁelds .  HyTime Another  format  is  the  Hypermedia Time-Based  Structuring  Language  HyTime , an SGML-based approach to multimedia interchange. SGML   Abstraction and inheritance  Transfer syntax   312  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  HyTime  supports  the  coexistence  of  disparate  multimedia  information objects by a uniform object identiﬁcation representation. It further pro- vides a uniform representation of metainformation about notation data objects and a uniform multimedia information structure.  HyTime modules  HyTime consists of the following six modules:    The  base  module  is  similar  to  SGML  and  encompasses  several  utility    The location address module creates pointers to information of any form  architectural forms.  and at any location.    The  hyperlinks  module  deals  with  the  navigational  relationships  be- tween  information  pieces.  It  therefore  relies  on  the  location  address module that identiﬁes these pieces.    The  measurement  module  handles  the  numerical  dimensions  such  as  time, space, and digital datastreams.    The  scheduling  module  represents  the  compositional  relationships  by describing  coordinate  spaces  whose  axes  correspond  to  domains  of measurement  and  events.  Information  objects  are  “located”  in  that space accordingly.    The rendition module provides constructs for projecting events within  the coordinate spaces and modifying the objects of events.  The  scheduling  and  rendition  modules  together  deﬁne  the  schedul- ing facilities of HyTime. Figure 8.5 shows the structuring facilities that enhance SGML.   The hyperlinked structure allows arbitrary relationships between nodes  i.e., information pieces , providing high ﬂexibility by allowing links to have any number of link ends. A basic feature of HyTime is the Finite Co- ordinate Spaces  FCS . This is given by the scheduled structure, which is application-neutral. Different associative lists may be created from an FCS that all refer to information objects maintained once. This means that an FCS provides ordered views of the same content elements. The interpreta- tion of the ordering within the lists  i.e., the semantics  is left to the ap- plication,  although  an  FCS  can  provide  instructions  for  spatiotemporal rendering or formatting of data. Newcomb, Kipp, and Newcomb  1991  and Kretz and Colaitis  1992  provide early overviews of HyTime.  8.2 VIEWING XML DATA ON THE WEB  In the previous section, we dealt with some groundwork and formal as- pects  of  presentation  and  representation  of   multimedia   information.   8.2 Viewing XML Data on the Web  313  1  SGML  Hierarchical Structure  2  8  3  6  9  10  4  5  7  11  12  2  8  1  HyTime  Hyperlinked  Structure  3  6  9  10  4  5  7  11  12  HyTime  Scheduled Structure  12  1  2  3  4  5  6  Figure 8.5 From SGML structuring to HyTime scheduling  Newcomb 1995 .  Now we come to more concrete aspects of the presentation of XML-based information. The main application in that context, of course, is the Web.  8.2.1 Overview of Viewing XML Data  The basic idea of markup languages is the separation of the content of a document from its form  i.e., how it is presented to a user . Therefore ex- tra processing is needed before viewing marked-up information on a Web front end. For us, two mechanisms are of particular interest: formatting  Markup languages   314  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  and  transformation.  From  the  latter  perspective,  XML  may  have  to  be transformed  into  another  format,  an  HTML  document,  for  instance. Transformation aspects will be covered later.  The  formatting  of  XML  documents  may  be  achieved  by  using  style sheets. They may be regarded as collections of rules to transform abstract XML information into formatted information to be passed on toward an output device. The transformation is done by a style sheet processor that will read the XML input along with the style sheet given. From that the processor generates the output accordingly, as long as the style sheet fol- lows  a  notation  the  processor  understands.  This  process  may  be  per- formed on the server as well as on the client side of an Internet-based information system. The basic idea is illustrated in Figure 8.6 from the general perspective of SGML.  The decision on whether to process an XML document on the server or to pass it to the client depends on the application. As long as we only wish to view XML-based information, we may perform the processing on  Formatting and style sheets  Client- vs. server-side generation  SGML Rules  Parser  Source  Document  Formatter  Target  Document  Generic Markup Definition  DTD   User Group  Specific Definitions  Semantics of  Attributes  Figure 8.6 Overview of creating ﬁnal form documents in SGML  Steinmetz and Nahrstedt 1995 .   8.2 Viewing XML Data on the Web  315  the server. If an application requires XML data for decentralized process- ing on the client side, we have to send the XML document along with the style sheet. This may be the case in e-commerce applications, for exam- ple, when exchanging product information or ordering data.  8.2.2 HTML  The Hypertext Markup Language  HTML  is the well-known tagged lan- guage for setting up Web sites for Internet applications  i.e., Web publish- ing . It may be regarded as an application of SGML; that is, the HTML tag set is deﬁned using SGML notation.   The HTML speciﬁcation is currently available from the W3C as version 4.01, which is a revised version of HTML 4  HTML 1999 . Here “revision” means changes to the HTML DTD. We will not be discussing HTML in principle  here;  we  will  assume  you  are  familiar  with  the  concepts  of HTML. Nor will we elaborate the elements of the revision here. Rather we will  give  an  overview  of  the  basic  features  of  HTML  and  its  future direction.  While earlier versions of HTML, namely, 2.0 of 1995 and 3.2 of 1997, focused on supporting textual and multimedia content as well as hyper- link features, HTML 4 goes much further. The major goal in the develop- ment of the HTML versions was to achieve a broad consensus on the lan- guage-supporting  interoperability  between  manifold  platforms  and presentations on client devices. The additional features incorporated into HTML 4 include the following:    Scripting languages to support dynamic Web applications  e.g., forms  objects .  that react to user input .    Style sheets to give authors more control of the rendering of HTML content.  Style  information  may  be  speciﬁed  internally  in  the  docu- ment as well as in external documents associated with the HTML doc- ument. We will come back to style sheets in the next subsection.    Better printing facilities for larger source documents that are divided into several HTML documents. These parts may be interconnected by the “link” element or by RDF, described in Section 3.3.    Better accessibility for users with disabilities, through the support of more clearly distinct documents with regard to structure and presenta- tion. Style sheets contain new features for nonvisual rendering, access keys, semantic grouping of controls, and so forth.    More  multimedia  options   e.g.,  support  for  embedding  external  HTML 4 features   316  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  Formatting  CSS  CSS and XML    Internationalization of documents, including the representation of in- ternational  characters,  text  direction,  punctuation,  and  other  world language issues, to support the publishing of documents written in any language as well as the indexing for search engines.  Adding Style to HTML Documents When considering formatting information in the context of Web design in HTML, the Web designer has two options:  1  formatting single ele- ments  in  single  documents  using  speciﬁc  attributes  or   2   employing internal or external styles.  Formatting is supported by the inclusion in the HTML speciﬁcation of tags and attributes, for example, the bold element   or the “font size” attribute. This way of creating a Web page layout may be viable for very small Web sites but is certainly not for large Web sites with dozens, hun- dreds, or even thousands of Web pages.   A solution to this problem is style sheets. Style sheets allow the central deﬁnition of formatting information for elements of tagged documents. Cascading  style  sheets   CSS   are  a  well-known  method  of  formatting HTML documents. Take a corporate Web site as an example. Since a style sheet document may be assigned to an arbitrary number of HTML docu- ments, a consistent look and feel for the site can be guaranteed just by de- veloping a CSS document that follows the corporate design requirements. An additional beneﬁt of using CSS is that maintenance of Web sites is much easier for layout.   The use of a CSS with HTML is de facto optional: standard browsers such  as  Netscape  Communicator  and  Microsoft  Internet  Explorer  have internalized the HTML document type deﬁnition. The browsers know the elements of HTML and have a predeﬁned formatting for them.  Using Style Sheets with XML The presentation of HTML through standard browsers for end user pre- sentation does not require an extra style sheet. XML has in any case to be associated  with  style  sheets.  The  use  of  CSS  is  not  very  common  with XML, although the Mozilla browser  www.mozilla.org , for instance, pro- vides  the  feature  of  directly  viewing  XML  content  on  the  basis  of  the internalized conversion to HTML.  Principal elements of CSS are assignments of the kind   Selector s  { declaration }  with the declaration given as  property : value.   8.2 Viewing XML Data on the Web  317  An example taken from HTML would accordingly be  H2, H3 { font-family: roman; font-size: 14pt }.  Additionally,  properties  may  be  assigned  in  a  context-sensitive  way.  Let’s have a look at the following example:  H1 EM { color: red }  The effect is that the content of element EM to be emphasized in H1 will be displayed in red. This feature is helpful for a variety of deﬁnitions, such as numbering lists, to mention just one.   Style sheets will be associated with XML documents following the cor- responding  W3C  recommendation,  available  from  www.w3.org TR xml- stylesheet . The recommendation provides the xml-stylesheet instruction to process the style sheet document speciﬁed within the XML document in question. Here is an example, ﬁrst as an instruction in an HTML docu- ment, then the corresponding XML version.        8.2.3 XHTML  The Extensible Hypertext Markup Language  XHTML  is a collection of document types and modules speciﬁed by the W3C “that reproduce, sub- set, and extend HTML 4”  XHTML 2000a . The document types are XML based; that is, XHTML is an HTML version that uses XML syntax. The ele- ment  types  are  the  same  as  for  HTML.  Documents  written  in  XHTML always have to be well formed and valid. XHTML has been designed to work  with  XML-based  user  agents.  A  user  agent  denotes  a  system  that provides  functionality  and  services  to  retrieve  and  process  documents containing, for example, XML or XHTML content.   The  basic  idea  behind  XHTML  is  to  provide  Web  developers  with  a standard that allows for richer Web pages on a wider variety of client de- vices and yet still be in accordance with the rigorousness of XML. The in- creasing range of browser platforms and applications is being met by the modular design of XHTML, to be discussed later in this subsection.   The main beneﬁt to be gained from using XHTML is the ﬂexibility for Web  application  developers.  This  refers  to  the  future  interoperability within and among various XHTML environments as well as to the poten- tial of enhancing the language with new elements that will be needed for future applications.  User agents  Richer Web pages  Flexibility   318  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  Reformulation of HTML 4  XHTML 1.0  XHTML 2000a  was recommended in January 2000. It is the  ﬁrst  document  type  in  the  XHTML  family  and  is  based  on  HTML 4.01. It is thus a reformulation of the three HTML 4 document types  ﬂa- vors  using XML 1.0, resulting in the following:     XHTML 1.0 Strict is for documents that do not contain any tags asso- ciated  with  layout.  Layout  effects  are  then  deﬁned  together  with W3C’s CSS language.    XHTML 1.0 Transitional supports users whose browser versions do not understand  style  sheets.  It  allows  the  adjustment  of  markups  with layout-oriented attributes.    XHTML 1.0 Frameset supports the partitioning of the browser window  into HTML frames.  XHTML 1.0 may be used to specify content that is XML conforming. It also works with client applications that conform to HTML 4. Therefore XHTML documents may be viewed, edited, and validated with standard XML tools. HTML may be checked using a tool provided by the W3C, the “HTML Tidy”  www.w3.org People Raggett tidy . It also allows HTML con- tent to be rolled over into XML to be delivered in XHTML.  M  A  The  following  is  a  small  example  of  an  XHTML  document.  The DOCTYPE declaration prior to the root element   has to reference one of the three DTDs mentioned earlier. Along with the root element, the XHTML namespace is speciﬁed accordingly. Additionally the name- space is used along with another namespace deﬁning MathML, which is used to semantically specify mathematical formulas to be presented on Web clients.  T  E  Y  F L     <!DOCTYPE html  PUBLIC “~  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict   EN”  “DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”>  <html xmlns=http:  www.w3.org 1999 xhtml  xml:lang=”en” lang=”en”>   A Math Example            Team-Fly®   8.2 Viewing XML Data on the Web  319   The following is MathML markup:                3         x                    MathML reference available from    W3C Website   In order to be compatible with HTML, some guidelines have to be fol- lowed. There are also some differences with HTML that have to be taken into consideration.  See section 4 and appendix C of XHTML 2000a for a corresponding overview.   In the next step of the W3C’s XHTML roadmap, the elements and at- tributes  have  been  modularized  into  convenient  collections  for  use  in documents  that  combine  HTML  with  other  tag  sets   XHTML  2001a . “Modularization” in this context means to break up XHTML into smaller sets  of  elements  since  not  all  client  platforms  will  need  the  complete deﬁnition.  An example of such a set of modules is XHTML Basic  XHTML 2000b , which  is  targeted  at  mobile  applications.  XHTML  content  can  be  ex- changed among PDAs, mobile phones, desktop computers, and TV sets. Numerous companies in the ﬁelds of communication and content have announced that they will support XHTML for mobile business applica- tions. XHTML Basic subsets HTML such that a document can be shared among a maximum number of user agents. Of course, it may be extended to  meet  particular  requirements  of  a  community  and  still  support  the presentation of XHTML Basic content.  A reduced set of HTML features has been the starting point for the de- sign  of  XHTML  Basic,  including  basic  text   headings,  paragraphs,  and  XHTML modularization  Mobile applications   320  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  Well-formed markup  lists , hyperlinks and links to related documents, basic forms, basic tables, images, and metainformation. All of these are part of the corresponding XHTML modules, which are listed later in this subsection, given as cur- rent version XHTML 1.1.  These  features  may  also  be  found  in  document  types  representing subsets and variants of HTML for the type of user agents outlined earlier. Examples include Compact HTML  Kamada 1998 , the Wireless Markup Language   WML ,  and  the  “HTML  4.0  Guidelines  for  Mobile  Access”  Kamada et al. 1999 . WML will be considered in Section 8.4.  XHTML  1.1   XHTML  2001b   deﬁnes  a  new  XHTML  document  type based upon the modularization work of W3C. Unlike XHTML 1.0, it pro- vides a consistent basis for future document types being cleanly separated from the deprecated, legacy functionality of HTML 4. In turn it is a refor- mulation of XHTML 1.0 Strict.  Thus the goal of XHTML to move Web content from malformed, non- standard into well-formed markup, given by XML, has been approached a lot more closely by XHTML 1.1. The motivation of XHTML 1.0 was to migrate HTML-based content to XHTML and XML. With the modulariza- tion of XHTML, support for deprecated elements and attributes has been removed from the XHTML family.   The basic idea is to support the provision of markup content from a se- mantic perspective rather than with presentation-oriented functionality, as  is  given  with  XHTML  Transitional  and  Frameset  document  types. Many of the presentation features of XHTML 1.0 are avoided.  The XHTML 1.1 document type is based upon a set of XHTML mod- ules  deﬁned  in  XHTML   2001a .  Here  are  the  features  associated  with each XHTML module.    Structure module: body, head, html, title   Text module: abbr, acronym, address, blockquote, br, cite, code, dfn, div, em, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, kbd, p, pre, q, samp, span, strong, var    Hypertext module: a   List module: dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li   Object module: object, param   Presentation module: b, big, hr, i, small, sub, sup, tt   Edit module: del, ins   Bidirectional text module: bdo   Forms  module:  button,  fieldset,  form,  input,  label,  legend,  select, optgroup, option, textarea    Table module: caption, col, colgroup, table, tbody, td, tfoot, th,  thead, tr    8.2 Viewing XML Data on the Web  321    Image module: img   Client-side image map module: area, map   Server-side image map module: attribute ismap on img   Intrinsic events module: event attributes   Metainformation module: meta   Scripting module: noscript, script   Style sheet module: style element   Style attribute module: style attribute  deprecated    Link module: link   Base module: base   Ruby annotation module: ruby, rbc, rtc, rb, rt, rp  XHTML 1.0 and XHTML 1.1 are recommendations of the W3C, the latter as of May 31, 2001. XHTML 1.0 Second Edition is currently a work- ing draft as of October 4, 2001. The ﬁrst draft of XHTML 2.0 is scheduled for early 2002. XHTML Modularization is a proposed recommendation as of  February  22,  2001.  Further  steps  on  the  W3C  roadmap  are  to  be determined.  XHTML may be viewed and processed using standard XML tools. Ad- ditionally, Web browsers can read XHTML. The ﬁrst editor for XHTML has recently been presented by Mozquito. “Mozquito Factory” supports the authoring of Web content in XHTML as well as the import of HTML documents and their translation into XHTML. The Mozquito approach will be discussed in Section 8.3.2.  8.2.4 Formatting Objects with XSL  In this section, we will discuss an approach to formatting documents that goes beyond the options of CSS. The focus of our discussion will be on formatting objects that represent structural units in documents.  XSL and XSLT The Extensible Style Language  XSL  is a language to deﬁne style sheets, as was discussed in Section 2.7. It is similar to CSS in that it separates for- matting information from content. It also supports printing options and the transmission of XML documents across various platforms. The XSL speciﬁcation contains three parts: the XSLT language for transformation  see Chapter 9 , the XPath language to access parts of or whole XML doc- uments  see Section 2.5.1 , and ﬁnally XSL formatting objects, which will be discussed later in this section.   322  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  DSSSL  Formatting objects  The Extensible Style Language Transformation  XSLT  is the language that is used within XSL documents to transform XML documents into other documents, either XML again or HTML. This allows content to be represented in several XML documents for particular applications.  The relationship between XSL and XSLT can be shown with Document Style Semantics and Speciﬁcation Language  DSSSL , which although per- haps outdated still serves to visualize the key procedure here. It was de- veloped  to  process  SGML  documents,  and  many  of  its  concepts  have been incorporated into XSL and XSLT. The transformation and format- ting process is shown in Figure 8.7, where the gray elements are speciﬁed by DSSSL.  As previously stated, XSLT provides transformation and XSL provides formatting. XSL then may be considered as a speciﬁc document type. Its elements are formatting objects  FOs . These FOs deﬁne formatting seman- tics and are generated by a preceding transformation step, performed, not so surprisingly, by XSLT. The XSL-FO then may be converted into arbi- trary  ﬁnal  formats  such  as  HTML  for  online  presentation,  RTF  for  text processing,  or  PostScript  or  PDF  for  printing.  An  example  of  printing XML via PDF is given at www.dpawson.co.uk xsl print.html. We may also use XSLT to generate other documents such as XHTML or WML  see Sec- tion 8.4.2 .

Figure 8.7 Overview of the DSSSL processing of SGML documents  Behme and Mintert 2000 .   8.2 Viewing XML Data on the Web  323  XSL-FO  Areas  XSL Formatting Objects XSL Formatting Objects  XSL-FO  makes up almost two-thirds of the XSL speciﬁcation   www.w3.org TR xsl slice6.htmlfo-section .  It  describes  how to present page-oriented output. Although XSL-FO code can be produced manually, the more usual way would be to transform an XML document into another XML document using XSL-FO vocabulary. This transforma- tion  from  a  semantic  to  a  presentational  representation  is  done  with XSLT.  Since  browsers  cannot  display  XSL-FO  documents  directly,  apart from X-Smiles  see Section 8.3.2 , a further transformation to ﬁnal output has to be done, most likely to PDF  see later in this subsection .  The content of XSL-FO documents is organized into areas, which can be thought of as rectangular boxes containing the formatting objects that represent the content. The areas form a kind of hierarchy. The spatial po- sitioning of the areas is done by an XSL formatter. When being processed, the formatting objects document is broken up into pages, normally one for Web presentation and individual pages for printed output. Each page then contains a number of areas.  While CSS is mainly used for Web presentation, XSL-FO goes further and provides a more sophisticated layout model that also supports multi- purpose publishing. We will not reproduce the deﬁnition of all the for- matting  objects  here.  Instead  we  will  summarize  them  in  a  condensed list, giving some hints where the FO names are not self-explanatory. The recommendation documents encompass the following FOs:    Pagination and layout formatting objects: deﬁnition of master pages and  page sequences, particularly of interest for printed output    Block formatting objects: formatting of text-based information such as  paragraphs, titles, and captions given as block objects    Inline  formatting  objects:  portions  of  text  inside  block  formatting objects;  for  example,  adding  the  word  “Page”  to  a  running  foot  for pagination    List formatting objects   Table formatting objects   Out-of-line formatting objects: ﬂoating objects and footnotes to be placed  at the next possible position in the output document    Other  formatting  objects:  for  example,  wrappers  for  property  heritage  and markers for running heads and feet  The order of the FOs listed here, roughly speaking, corresponds to the order in which content is placed. Further formatting details, however, are speciﬁed by attributes assigned to the individual FO. Many of these   324  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  Final-form PDF  formatting  properties  have  CSS  equivalents   e.g.,  font-family ;  others do not.  The set of standard XSL-FO properties includes the following:    Common absolute position properties: absolute positioning including size   Common aural properties: rendition of FO content for output via voice  processors    Common border, padding, and background properties   Common font properties   Common  hyphenation  properties:  line  breaking  including  language-  dependent hyphenation    Common keeps and breaks properties: column and page breaks   Common margin properties: spacing and indents   Other properties: speciﬁc to certain FOs, such as character- and color- related  properties,  conversions,  pagination  and  layout,  dynamic  ef- fects, and many more  The two preceding lists give a ﬁrst glimpse of what XSL-FO is about, particularly for publishing purposes. A tutorial on using XSL-FO with XEP to produce ﬁnal-form PDF documents, just to mention one application, can  be  found  at  www.renderx.com Tests doc html tutorial.html.  We  will come back to this topic in Section 8.6.1.  Here is a short example of the use of formatting objects, taken from  Harold  2001 , available online at www.ibiblio.org xml books bible2 .                             <fo:block font-size=”20pt”   font-family=”serif” line-height=”30pt”>  Hydrogen      8.2 Viewing XML Data on the Web  325  <fo:block font-size=”20pt”   font-family=”serif” line-height=”30pt” > Helium              Here we can see the hierarchy mentioned earlier, starting with the root element including the other nested FOs. The content itself is speciﬁed in the  two  elements  given  by  fo:block,  including  the  corresponding  text formatting properties.  Generating Final-Form Documents for Presentation Obviously we have a lot of choices of which technique to use for presen- tation. Figure 8.8 summarizes some of the available alternatives.  Which do we choose? CSS, for example, has proven to be very useful for presenting HTML content. But XSL is XML technology. There is no one right answer along the lines of “CSS if you can, XSL if you must.” Table 8.1 compares the major aspects of CSS and XSL.  CSS vs. XSL  CSS  CSS  XSL- FO  XSLT  HTML  Presentation  CSS  XML  XSLT  XML or  HTML  Figure 8.8 Presentation techniques using CSS and XSL  W3C 2000a .   326  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  Table 8.1  Comparison of CSS and XSL.

So far we have been dealing with  only  conceptual  considerations,  and  reality  may  bring  us  back  to earth. The speciﬁcations are in different states of completion, and there- fore accepted standardization and wide market penetration may be some years away, for example, for XSL-FO.   So,  unless  the  different  components  of  Web-based  environments— ranging from authoring to data management and business middleware, to  the  variety  of  standard  and  exotic  output  devices—fully  implement and support these speciﬁcations, we will have to make pragmatic com- promises.  We  expect  the  support  for  XSL  by  client  devices,  such  as  browsers, handhelds, and so on, to be on the server side rather than the client side. The server will handle the presentation of XML content by transforming it into HTML, probably enhanced with CSS. In mixed environments, dif- ferent style sheets could be set up for the output devices that are XSL en- abled and for those that are not.  8.3 USER INTERACTION WITH XFORMS  User input  Forms  to  capture  user  input  have  become  commonplace  in  Web-based applications,  particularly  with  the  more  advanced  requirements  of  e- commerce. So we will give a short overview of XForms as the XML-based proposal  for  adequately  handling  user  interaction  through  forms,  fol- lowed by sample implementations.  8.3.1 Concepts of XForms  Traditional Web forms as known from HTML and XHTML have become an  important  feature  in  interactive  Web  applications  that  collect  data from users. As stated earlier, the current W3C efforts aim at separating the   8.3 User Interaction with XForms  327  Main components  structural information deﬁning elements in Web documents from their appearance in the Web browser or other user agents.   In accordance with that goal, XForms  www.w3.org Markup forms  in- troduces abstract concepts to decouple data, logic, and presentation of Web forms, making XForms a successor to XHTML forms. The main com- ponents of XForms are the following:    The  XForms  model  describes  the  forms  independently  from  device-  speciﬁc rendering. The presentation options are attached separately.    The XForms user interface provides the necessary visual form controls  i.e.,  widgets  for  user  interaction   that  can  be  used  inside  different XML documents  e.g., XHTML and SVG .    The XForms submit protocol deﬁnes the method by which a form sends  and receives data.    The XForms processor is an implementation of the XForms model. Its components,  behavior,  and  mechanisms  are  described  by  a  corre- sponding reference model.  Figure 8.9 summarizes the major components of XForms.  The different components—particularly XForms model, instance data, and  form  controls—are  connected  with  bindings.  The  binding  expres- sions of XForms are based on XPath  see Section 2.5.1 ; that is, they use XPath datatypes.  If we consider forms to consist of a purpose, a presentation, and data, we could argue that earlier implementations of Web technologies did not  Appearance vs. purpose  Form Logic and Controls  XForms Model  XForms  User  Interface  XForms  Use for  Submit Protocol  presentation    Instance  Data  L M T H X  L M W  G V S  Figure 8.9 Overview of the major components of XForms.   328  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  separate the presentation of a form  i.e., its appearance  from its purpose. This separation would deﬁnitely be helpful in adding conditional or in- put-dependent dynamics. That is, forms should be able to differentiate several user input cases and adapt accordingly. Let’s look at an example. First the XHTML code:      Select Payment Method:    <input type=”radio” name=”paytype”  value=”cash”>Cash   <input type=”radio” name=”paytype”  value=”credit”>Credit     Credit Card Number: <input type=”text”  name=”cc” >      Expiration Date: <input type=”text”  M  A  name=”exp” >        E  T     Y  F L  This  sample  code  produces  two  radio  buttons  to  select  the  payment method, input ﬁelds for credit card number and expiration date, and a submit button.  Now have a look at the corresponding XForms code:  <selectOne xmlns=http:  www.w3.org 2001 06 xforms   ref=”paytype”>   Select Payment Method      Cash   Credit           Credit Card Number      Team-Fly®   8.3 User Interaction with XForms  329      Expiration Date        Here we have basically the same interaction elements. But in contrast to XHTML, the radio buttons are not hard-coded, the input elements such as textbox are predeﬁned, and the input is submitted as XML data.  Most  important  from  a  presentational  perspective,  the  rendering of speciﬁc elements can be done by different devices. This refers to the selectOne element that replaced the radio buttons in the XHTML sample code.  This decoupling allows Web authors to create richer Web applications with advanced forms logic, multiple forms per page, or multiple pages per form. In turn, as in other XML initiatives, the international aspects are improved and a variety of devices are supported.   8.3.2 Implementations  In the previous sections, we discussed the concepts of XHTML. XHTML technology has already been implemented in the Mozquito and X-Smiles tools that we present next.  Mozquito Mozquito is an example of XHTML technology that has been enhanced with additional features. Since the support for forms has been a focus, the XHTML-FML   Form  Markup  Language   has  been  deﬁned  for  advanced form functionality. Further efforts will lead in the direction of fully inte- grating FML with XForms.  The basic idea of Mozquito is to transform its documents into HTML documents  with  JavaScript  code  that  can  be  processed  by  any  Web browser. This is done on the server side, thus taking some of the load off the Web client. JavaScript was chosen so as to be independent from in- stalling new browser versions or plug-ins.   Since most Web site code is produced by authoring tools on the client side, Mozquito provides a corresponding authoring environment that in- cludes an XML parser to check on well-formedness and validity. An over- view  of  the  Mozquito  Factory  can  be  found  at  www.mozquito.org html  lang-english beginning.html. There you will also ﬁnd FML references and speciﬁcations.  XHTML-FML   330  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  X-Smiles X-Smiles  www.x-smiles.org  is a nonproﬁt Java-based XML browser that supports several XML technologies. Although XForms and SMIL are fea- tures  of  X-Smiles,  SVG,  XSLT  Transforms,  and  XSL-FO  are  supported through third-party components. A detailed overview of what is currently supported can be found at www.x-smiles.org xsmiles_features.html.  The  main  objective  of  X-Smiles  is  the  support  for  desktop  solutions and for embedded solutions. Both of these may be mixed in a single doc- ument. An additional goal is the processing and streaming of multimedia content.  X-Smiles is still in the prototype stage  version 0.45 was released on October 26, 2001 . The next steps, among others, are compliance with SMIL 2.0, full support of XForms models, and reimplementation of the formatting objects renderer.  8.4 EXCHANGING INFORMATION THROUGH  WAP DEVICES  Mobile information access seems to be the current wave in information management  and  processing.  An  increasing  importance  has  been  at- tached to m-commerce, to mention just one buzzword, in business-to- business  as  well  as  business-to-consumer  relationships.  This  raises  the need for appropriate techniques and formats as well as for applications and technical devices. For our discussion, since we are only interested in XML-related presentation formats for mobile devices, we will give a short introduction to the WAP technology followed by a description of the cor- responding markup language, WML.  8.4.1 What Is WAP?  The  Wireless  Application  Protocol   WAP   is  an  open  speciﬁcation  that allows  mobile  access  to,  and  exchange  of,  information  and  services.  It embraces handheld devices such as mobile phones and palmtops PDAs, as well as pagers and, to a lesser extent, car radios.  Since  WAP  is  not  based  on  a  particular  transmission  standard   e.g., UMTS or GSM , interoperability is guaranteed for such applications. Most of  the  manufacturers  of  mobile  devices  have  committed  to  supporting the speciﬁcation, which therefore can be regarded as a de facto standard. While WAP speciﬁes only the transmission of data to and from com- pliant  devices,  a  language  is  needed  to  deﬁne  the  contents  for  WAP  Interoperability   8.4 Exchanging Information through WAP Devices  331  Microbrowser presentation  WAP stack  WAE  WAE architecture  applications. This language is WML, which is covered in the following subsection.  Devices need an appropriate WAP-enabled microbrowser to display in- formation. Most mobile phones now come with such a browser. For other applications and devices, browsers are available for a variety of operating system platforms: Microsoft Windows, PalmOS, and JavaOS, to mention just a few.  The  WAP  standard  is  based  on  an  OSI  architecture,  the  WAP  stack, which consists of ﬁve major layers. They specify the front-end interface to the devices, the session handling, transmission, security, and transport at the back-end interface to the network.  Typical  applications  for  WAP  are  communication   e.g.,  mailing  and chatting   and  unidirectional  information   e.g.,  the  weather  forecast  or the movie schedule of your local theater . Bidirectional information ex- change  i.e., user action and response  is required for ﬁnancial applica- tions  e.g., online banking or brokerage services , shopping, electronic or- ganizing, navigation and tour guiding, and home automation  i.e., the remote control of devices in your house . The last is expected to be an im- portant feature in the near future.  Part of the WAP effort is the Wireless Application Environment  WAE , speciﬁed in WAE  2000 . It aims at building a general-purpose and inter- operable  application  environment  using  Web  technologies  to  provide applications and services for wireless platforms. Several techniques con- tribute  to  the  WAE  speciﬁcation,  including  the  speciﬁcations  of  Wire- less Markup  Language   WML ,  WMLScript,  WAP  Binary  XML  Format  WBXML , and Wireless Telephony Application  WTA .  The WAE architecture is based on a client-server model, as are tradi- tional  Web  services.  Content  and  services  are  hosted  on  standard  Web servers using standard URLs. In addition to the basic client-server model, a  gateway  provides  encoding  and  decoding  mechanisms  as  well  as WMLScript compilation for content exchange between server and mobile client and the handling of user action. Thus, on the server side, standard Web  content  is  produced  at  a  client’s  request.  The  encoding  enables  a user agent to navigate through Web content on the basis of the WML and WMLScript. The WTA in this context speciﬁes extensions for call and fea- ture control mechanisms in telephony applications. Figure 8.10 gives a very basic architectural overview.  For more information about the standard, technical equipment, and development aspects, you may start your investigation at the WAP Forum  www.wapforum.org , the Web site of the industry association that devel- oped the standard.

An overall overview of WAP is given in the WAP Forum white paper  WAP 2000 . A basic goal of the WAP Forum is to work together with the Web Coalition  W3C  and the Internet Engineering Task Force  IETF  to integrate WML with next-generation HTML and HTTP.  8.4.2 WML Wireless Markup Language  WML  is used to provide static information for WAP applications in an appropriate way. It has to meet the limitations of current wireless communication. Therefore reduced information has to be  provided  according  to  the  presentational  capabilities  of  the  devices and the low transmission bandwidth.  Both WML and HTML are markup languages, based on tags. But, by looking closer at WML’s structure, you will ﬁnd that it is formed of well- deﬁned units of user actions, called cards. The basic concept of accessing information in WAP applications is navigating between cards that may be dispersed in several WML documents. Cards may be grouped into sets, called decks, each  describing  an  interaction  with  the  user.  This  design meets the limitations of even the small-size displays of handheld devices. The concept of organizing information in cardlike units is similar to Hy- perCard, an early authoring approach for the development of multimedia applications, which is still available and in use  hypercard.apple.com . Here is a small WML example  WML 2000a :  Cards  Decks   8.4 Exchanging Information through WAP Devices  333                               Hello world. This is the first card …   This is the second card. Goodbye.   The main features of WML are the following:  WML features    Support for text and images, providing the author with elements for  specifying such content and laying it out to a certain extent.    Support for user input such as controls for text entry, selection from several options, and task invocation. These controls may be presented by the user agents as being bound to physical keys, voice commands, or sections of the screen presentation.    Navigation and history stack. The former keeps track of user actions on  the basis of WML’s several URL-based navigation mechanisms.    Abstract  speciﬁcation  of  layout  and  presentation  for  independence  from particular interfaces and devices.    Optimization for narrow-band devices, mainly through the minimiza-  tion of server requests and the amount of data to be exchanged.    State and context management  i.e., the provision of variable states . These may be used  to modify the content of parameterized cards and can be shared among decks without server communication.   8.4.3 WMLScript WMLScript  enhances  JavaScript  in  order  to  program  user  agents   i.e., mobile devices . It allows the design of more advanced user interfaces for mobile applications by enriching browsing and presentation on the basis of WML by behavioral capabilities. It allows the performance of client- based processing to be fully integrated with the WML browser.   Client-based processing   334  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  Examples  of  client-based  action  include  any  interaction  with  the user in  general,  checking  user  input  before  passing  a  request  to  the server, or accessing device facilities and peripherals. The invocation of WMLScript may be triggered by events caused by user interaction or by the environment.  WMLScript supports several operations  e.g., assignment, arithmetical, logical ,  script  functions   deﬁned  internally  or  externally ,  and  library functions   e.g.,  for  ﬂoating  point  and  string  handling   deﬁned  in  the WML Standard Libraries Speciﬁcation  WML 2000b .  8.4.4 WBXML  The WAP Binary XML Content Format  WBXML  has been designed as a means to reduce the transmission size of XML documents on channels with low bandwidth  WBXML 2000 . The element structure of XML is preserved without losing any functionality or semantic information.  Reduction of document size is based on tokenization of the XML syn- tax. This means that any entity, tag, attribute, and so forth is mapped to a  token.  The  following  example  speciﬁes  a  tokenized  WML  deck  and demonstrates variable and attribute encoding and the use of the string table  WML 2000a . Let’s look at the source deck ﬁrst:                   X: $ X    Y: $ &x59;    Enter name :            We will not give a complete overview of the tokenized form here. To give an impression we have listed a subset of annotated token streams in Table 8.2, representing the ﬁrst two lines of the source deck code.   8.4 Exchanging Information through WAP Devices  335  Table 8.2  Example of Tokenized Source Deck Code.

Speciﬁcally,  script  languages  seem  to  be  the  target  of  many  re- searchers and developers since the normal markup structure of HTML is not very promising for further enhancements. An example of such an initiative  is  the  Virtual  Reality  Markup  Language   VRML .  Although there are some interesting applications for simulation  Luttermann and Grauer 1999  and scientiﬁc visualization, VRML has not become a mar- ket success.  In this section we will focus on current efforts to combine several me- dia  or  multimedia  features  with  the  Web,  starting  with  SMIL  and  pro- ceeding toward speech integration.  8.5.1 SMIL  The  Synchronized  Multimedia  Integration  Language   SMIL   is  an  XML document type for the description of multimedia presentations. It allows the positioning of media objects as well as spatial and temporal synchro- nization  i.e., along the third and fourth dimension, respectively .  Let’s consider to what extent SMIL meets the requirements composing  multimedia presentation, as they have been rolled out in Section 8.1.2.  First, SMIL allows the integration of several media elements since there are text, graphics, audio, and video formats. When working with SMIL, however, we have to take into consideration the capabilities of the differ- ent SMIL players that are available. Table 8.4 gives an overview of media types, the corresponding tags used in SMIL, and whether or not the me- dia are supported by the players  Helio 1999 .  We  will  start  with  a  short  introduction  to  the  features  of  SMIL.  The following code is a skeleton for SMIL documents. The head section is pri- marily for layout deﬁnitions, and the body section is primarily for speci- ﬁcation of media and synchronization parameters:                   8.5 Graphical and Multimedia Presentation with XML  337  Table 8.4 Overview of SMIL Attributes and Player Support.  Media  Tag  GRiNS  Soja  img GIF img JPEG audio Microsoft Wav Sun Audio audio Sun Audio Zipped audio MP3 audio text Plain text textstream Real text video Real movie AVI video video MPEG MOV video  G2  OK OK OK OK — OK OK OK OK OK OK OK  OK OK OK OK — — OK — — OK OK —  OK OK — OK OK — OK — — — — —                Positioning of Media SMIL provides absolute as well as relative positioning. Everything about the  layout  of  the  SMIL  application  goes  into  the  layout section  of  the SMIL document. For instance, have a look at the following code fragment:    Spatial composition  <root-layout width=”300” height=”200” background-color=”white” >  <region id=”picture-region” left=”25” top=”25”  width=”150” height=”100” z-index=”2” fit=”fill” >  <region id=”text-region” left=”125” top=”100” width=”100” height=”50” z-index=”1” >      338  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  Temporal synchronization  Y  F L  The attributes of the root-layout tag deﬁne the layout of the overall presentation  window.  Two  regions  for  an  image  and  a  text  object  are speciﬁed by their absolute coordinates. The z-index gives priority along the z-axis and thereby governs overlapping. In our example the text will overlay the image. The fit attribute can have different values: fill makes the  picture  ﬁt  into  the  region,  slice and meet make  the  picture  grow without distortion, and scroll is used if the region is too small and the picture is to be scrolled over. Relative positioning is achieved by assigning percentages to the top and left attributes.  Now we have to specify the objects that must be placed in the regions  deﬁned so far. This is done in the body section of the document:      <img src=”some.gif” alt=”Here is a picture”  region=”picture-region” >     M  A  E  T  Synchronization SMIL allows the deﬁnition of the duration of the presentation of a media element  e.g., the time period that a picture will be shown to a user . This is  intramedia  synchronization;  intermedia  synchronization  refers  to  at least two elements  e.g., sequential playing of two video objects . Further- more we may deﬁne that an element becomes apparent only after some period of time  i.e., it is delayed .  This may be done absolutely by setting the presentation time relative to the starting point of the SMIL application. The word “relative” is not really  appropriate  since  relative  synchronization  refers  to  the  temporal positioning of a media element with regard to another element within the SMIL show. Here is an example of sequential presentation with de- layed start and duration attributes:      <img src=”some.gif” alt=”Here is a picture”  region=”some_picture” dur=”10s” >  <img src=”another.jpg” alt=”And another one”  region=”another_picture” dur=”5s” begin=”1s” >       Team-Fly®   8.5 Graphical and Multimedia Presentation with XML  339  Service parameters  Finally, we may also want to deﬁne the presentation of some media el- ements  in  parallel,  which  SMIL  provides  for  with  a  corresponding  tag  . More advanced features include the event-based relative synchro- nization of media objects.  Switching SMIL  also  supports  user  preferences  including  some  types  of  service parameters.  This  is  done  by  deﬁning  options  using  the  switch tag.  An example is switching between several language versions of text elements according to the user settings. Another would be the evaluation of the transfer rate of a user’s Internet connection and changing the image res- olution  accordingly.  We  could  have  a  high-resolution  image  for  high bandwidth and a low-resolution image for low bandwidth. This aspect in turn also affects the appearance of the presentation, as does a possible adaptation to the screen resolution given by a front-end system. The fol- lowing listing gives an impression of how to use these features within SMIL:                    <text src=”800_600.en.txt” region=”size”  system-screen-size=”800X600” >  <text src=”1024_768.en.txt” region=”size”  system-screen-size=”1024X768” >            <text src=”vous_etes_francais.txt”   region=”main_message” >       <text src=”800_600.fr.txt” region=”size”  system-screen-size=”800X600” >   340  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  <text src=”1024_768.fr.txt” region=”size”  system-screen-size=”1024X768” >                 Here we have a nested switch: the outer one for the language choice and the inner ones for the screen resolution in either language followed by a “default” case  i.e., an unknown language .  Finally Integrating Multimedia with the Web? The  dynamics  currently  observable  in  XML-related  developments  not only  affect  the  traditional   re presentation  and  transformation  of  text content. Quite a lot of effort goes into providing developers with stan- dards  that  allow  for  richer  applications,  for  example,  by  adding  more advanced interaction and multimedia elements.   SMIL has been presented as an XML document type that provides au- thors with the fundamental mechanisms identiﬁed in Section 8.1.1, in particular, the spatiotemporal composition of content being coded in dif- ferent media types. The current version, SMIL 2.0  www.w3.org TR smil20 , is at the status of a W3C recommendation as of August 7, 2001, while SMIL 1.0 is the version supported, for example, by X-Smiles.   What we expect from the SMIL initiative is that the Web will become more  multimedia  aware.  But,  even  to  a  larger  extent  than  with  other XML-related standards, market penetration will take a while and there will need to be a more general shift from HTML-oriented toward XML- oriented applications. So we may have to wait for next-generation client- side tools that are not only SMIL enabled, but that also allow integration with other XML technologies that go beyond today’s Flash-like presenta- tions.  8.5.2 SVG  Scalable Vector Graphics  SVG  is an XML application that provides a lan- guage to describe two-dimensional graphics  SVG 2001 . These graphics are built from three types of objects: vector graphics, images, and text.  Multimedia awareness   8.5 Graphical and Multimedia Presentation with XML  341  Raster graphics  Vector graphics  SVG beneﬁts  Images,  or  raster  graphics,  denote  graphical  objects  that  are  pixel based,  that  is,  built  from  dots.  The  visual  information  is  coded  by  de- scribing each single pixel of the image, usually by a set of values for color, intensity, and so forth. The data size for such images may be determined directly by calculating the number of pixels times the number of bits or bytes needed for coding each pixel. Examples of corresponding image for- mats are TIFF, GIF, JPEG, and bitmap.  In contrast, vector graphics are much more efﬁcient in the description of content and operations including transmission, presentation on out- put devices, and necessary recalculations due to scaling, zooming, and so forth. Vector graphics are more ﬂexible in their appearance and usually consume less space than images do because the visual information is rep- resented directly by polygons. An object therefore is not a subset of pixels but is described as a path of lines and curves as geometric elements. An example is Corel Draw.  SVG  has  several  beneﬁts.  Because  it  is  a  vector  format,  it  leads  to smaller ﬁle sizes than regular bitmapped graphics, and it is resolution in- dependent, so that images can scale down or up to ﬁt proportionally into any size display. Because it is based on XML technology, it provides text labels and descriptions for searchability, and it has the ability to link to parts of an image.  Furthermore  it  provides  the  feature  of  complex  animation  either  by embedding corresponding SVG elements or by scripting. SVG objects can be assigned event handlers, which give the Web designer using SVG ani- mations  similar  opportunities  as,  for  example,  with  Macromedia  Flash  www.macromedia.com software ﬂash   presentations.  Following the principles of XML, SVG works by assigning attributes to elements.  For  instance,  the    element  may  have  positioning  at- tributes such as x, y, height, and width. It is the outermost element that deﬁnes the image. The allowZoomAndPan attribute gives the author control over  zooming  in  and  panning  over  the  image.  Other  elements  deﬁne shapes and lines, others deﬁne opacity, and others deﬁne ways to embed JPEGs and PNGs  W3C’s successor to GIF  into the SVG image. Still, these are only a few SVG elements; there are many more.  The following example describes a rectangle  see the   element in the listing for further detail  with a shadow. One specialty here is the or- dering  of  the  visual  elements.  The  rectangle  speciﬁed  second  will  be shown as the frontmost. This builds a virtual third dimension, as has al- ready been outlined in Section 8.1.2 and with the z-index of our SMIL sample.  To proceed further with this example, leading to a product pre- sentation for a ﬁctitious shop, see Eisenberg 1991.    342  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  <svg id=”body” width=”21cm” height=”13.5cm”  viewBox=”0 0 210 135”>  Part of a shop example     Rectangle with red border and light blue interior, with gray shadow rectangle.    <rect x=”10” y=”20” width=”150” height=”70”  transform=”translate 3, 3 ” fill=”999999” stroke=”999999” stroke-width=”1” >  <rect x=”10” y=”20” width=”150” height=”70”  fill=”eeeeff” stroke=”red” stroke-width=”1” >  Compatibility with SMIL  PDF generation     Currently, SVG images are not supported by standard Web browsers; therefore,  either  a  user  must  download  an  SVG  viewer,  or  a  plug-in  is needed to view SVG within the browser window.  Among other efforts the W3C seeks compatibility with SMIL by incor- porating features from SMIL  e.g., the   element  and extending the general-purpose animation capabilities given by SMIL. In turn, future versions of SMIL will use SVG content as media components.  To anticipate the section on type setting, we will mention an approach to generating PDF ﬁles from SVG here  www.digapp.com  newpages svg2pdf .html . This approach aims at giving an example of how to convert Web content into printable form on the basis of XML technology rather than using PostScript as an intermediate format, as is usually done for PDF.  8.5.3 VoiceXML  Speech and the Web  The Voice eXtended Markup Language  VoiceXML  is a proposal that has been made to the W3C and is part of its “Voice Browser” activity  W3C 2001b . The goal is to integrate speech-based services with Web applica- tions. In particular, the use of the telephone to access Web resources is investigated. The Web author thus does not have to deal with low-level services and resource management on the level of voice services.  VoiceXML is an XML schema speciﬁed by the dialog markup language of  W3C.  Originally  it  was  an  initiative  of  the  VoiceXML  Forum   www .voicexml.org , a program of IEEE-ISTO. The VoiceXML 1.0 speciﬁcation is   8.5 Graphical and Multimedia Presentation with XML  343  available as a W3C note  VoiceXML 2001 . The W3C has worked out a set of requirements and working draft language speciﬁcations that the dialog markup language is part of. The working draft of VoiceXML 2.0 is out as of October 23, 2001.  VoiceXML  describes  the  human-machine  interaction  provided  by voice  response  systems,  which  includes  output  of  synthesized  speech  text to speech , output of audio ﬁles, recognition of spoken input, recog- nition of DTMF  touchtone  input, recording of spoken input, and tele- phony features such as call transfer and disconnect.  Conceptually,  a  voice  service  is  a  sequence  of  interaction  dialogs  be- tween a user and an implementation platform. The dialogs are units of interaction provided by document servers that also maintain the overall service  logic  and  system  operations.  The  dialogs  are  conducted  by  a VoiceXML  interpreter.  User  input  within  a  dialog  results  in  further  re- quests submitted to a document server. The reply then may be another VoiceXML document containing dialogs to continue the session.  This section will give an overview of  these conceptual aspects as well as of the architectural model. Refer to www.w3.org Voice for a list of ven- dors  that  have  implemented  VoiceXML  1.0  in  conformance  with  the markup languages in the W3C Speech Interface Framework. Additional resources  that  may  be  of  interest  include  the  VoiceXML  DTD   www .voicexml.org voicexml1-0.dtd  and a series of tutorials for developers  www .voicexml.org tutorials index.html .  Architecture The design of VoiceXML may be explained along a high-level architecture  see Figure 8.11 . It encompasses several components that interact by fol- lowing client-server principles.  A document  server  is  a  Web  resource   node   that  produces  VoiceXML documents on request from a client application. This application is the VoiceXML interpreter, which operates within the VoiceXML interpreter context.  The  documents  returned  by  the  server  are  processed  by  the VoiceXML  interpreter.  The  VoiceXML  interpreter  context  acts  as  an “event listener,” monitoring user inputs in parallel with the VoiceXML interpreter. Examples are special user interactions  escape phrases  that need  particular  attendance  and  reactions  such  as  taking  the  user  to  a high-level personal assistant or changing user preferences.  A third tier in this client-server model is given by the implementation platform. It is controlled by the VoiceXML interpreter context and by the VoiceXML interpreter. This is necessary since we have events produced by the implementation platform due to user interactions or the system itself.  Voice response system  Interaction dialog  Client-server architecture   344  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  Document Server  Request  Document  VoiceXML Interpreter Context  VoiceXML Interpreter  Implementation Platform  Figure 8.11 Client-server architectural model of VoiceXML  VoiceXML 2001 .  Some have to be processed by the interpreter  e.g., user response  as far as it is part of the speciﬁc dialog. Others have to be acted upon by the inter- preter context  e.g., incoming phone call and initialization of the dialog .  Concepts A  VoiceXML  application  is  a  set  of  documents.  Each  document  forms  a conversational  ﬁnite-state  machine.  The  states  of  the  machine  are  the dialogs. A user is always in only one state at a time. Each dialog deter- mines the next dialog  and possibly document  to transition to, speciﬁed by URIs. If a dialog does not specify a successor, the conversation ends.   As stated earlier, dialogs are either forms or menus. A ﬁeld-gathering in- put  may  specify  a  grammar  of  valid  values.  A  menu  offers  the  user  a choice of options leading to the corresponding dialog. Subdialogs may be deﬁned that can be considered like function calls.  The sequence of interactions is called a session. A session may be termi-  nated by either the user, a document, or the interpreter context.  Documents of an application share the same application root document, which is always loaded with the application. That way “global” variables  Forms and menus  Sessions   8.5 Graphical and Multimedia Presentation with XML  345  Grammars  and grammars can be deﬁned and set to be valid for the duration of the application. Grammars for  speech  and or  DTMF  are  associated  with  di- alogs and active when the user is in the dialog. In mixed initiative applica- tions, the execution ﬂow may transition from one active grammar to an- other as if a statement had been made in that other grammar.   Besides the gathering of normal user input by forms, VoiceXML sup- ports the handling of events thrown by the platform due to special user reactions  or  semantic  errors  detected  by  the  interpreter.  In  accordance with well-known event-handling mechanisms, behavior event catching elements can be speciﬁed at any level and apply to all lower levels.  Simple Conversation Example The following example formulates a dialog between a user and a machine concerning the selection of a drink. The root element is  , which is a  container  for  dialogs  given  as  either  forms  or  menus.  Forms  present information and require input; menus offer choices of what to do next.               Would you like coffee,  tea, milk, or nothing?   <grammar src=”drink.gram”  type=”application x-jsgf” >        <submit next=           “http:  www.drink.example drink2.asp” >  Our example has a single form, which contains a ﬁeld and a block. A ﬁeld is  an  input  ﬁeld  that  a  user  has  to  provide  a  value  for  before  Fields   346  Chapter 8 Presentation Formats  proceeding to the next element in the form. This may be regarded as the machine asking for a choice  “Would you like . . .”  and the user answer- ing.  The  block  contains  a  submit element  that  passes  the  user’s  valid choice forward to another document given by URI speciﬁed. Since the form does not specify a successor dialog, the conversation ends.  8.6 DOCUMENT-BASED TYPE SETTING  So far we have focused on how to present XML-based data on the screens of personal computers, PDAs, and other mobile devices. The root of Web- based publication goes back to SGML, and SGML was driven by the pub- lishing industry. So we will also devote some space to notes on how to transform XML content into printable forms.  8.6.1 PDF  PDF generation  The Portable Document Format  PDF  is an open de facto standard from Adobe for electronic publishing. PDF is platform independent and pre- serves formatting information from any source document. The common procedure relies on PostScript: First, a PostScript document is created from the source document. Then it is read by the Adobe Acrobat Distiller tool and transformed into a target PDF document. Alternatively, applications may generate PDF directly through API calls to speciﬁc printer drivers.  A PDF document is a collection of objects that together make up one or more pages. Associated with the objects is structural information. The appearance of a page is represented by a content stream that contains all layout and formatting information speciﬁed by the application that cre- ated  the  document.  PDF  is  regarded  as  a  page  description  language. Therefore the page representation in PDF may be considered as holding graphical objects to be painted on the page.  The cross-platform functionality of PDF is based on a two-stage pro- cess. First, a device-independent description of the output is generated. Second, this description is interpreted and rendered on a speciﬁc output device.  Regarding the syntax of PDF, four components can be identiﬁed: ob- jects, ﬁle structure, document structure, and content stream.  Objects are composed within a data structure building the PDF document. PDF sup- ports basic types such as Boolean, integer and real values, strings, and ar-  PDF documents  PDF syntax   8.6 Document-Based Type Setting  347  rays. The ﬁle structure speciﬁes structural object handling within the PDF ﬁle. The document structure speciﬁes the use of objects to represent com- ponents like pages, fonts, and so forth. The content stream, as stated ear- lier, describes the appearance of entities by sequences of instructions. All PDF information is given as a stream of 8-bit bytes within a character set or as binary data  e.g., for included images .  For further information on PDF, see PDF 2000.   Transforming XML content into PDF documents may be performed us- ing XSL Formatting Objects  XSL-FO , as we saw in Section 8.2.4. Here we would  also  like  to  mention  an  Apache  project  called  FOP   xml.apache .org fop . FOP is a Java application based on XSL-FO that allows the con- version of formatting objects into a PDF document for printing. FOP also serves as a transcoder in the Batik toolkit  www.apache.org batik  to pro- duce PDF output from SVG.   Since  transformation  using  XSL  will  be  elaborated  on  in  Chapter  9, we will  not  discuss  the  single  steps  here  in  detail.  Instead  we  refer you to a  tutorial  available  on  IBM  developers’  site   www-106.ibm.com  developerworks education transforming-xml index.html .  8.6.2  La TeX  LaTeX  and  TeX—which  we  will  refer  to  together  as   La TeX—are  com- monly used in the community of natural sciences as a markup environ- ment  for  text  editing.  It  therefore  has  most  of  the  advantages  that  we have already discussed in earlier chapters.  Since  La TeX is widely used for editing and publishing purposes, the question arises, How do we generate XML content from  La TeX docu- ments, or vice versa? The latter direction is of primary interest in the con- text of this chapter.  A  number  of  proposals,  papers,  projects,  and  similar  research  have been  aimed  at  solving  this  particular  problem.  An  overview  as  well  as a list  of  resources  is  given  at  the  XML  Coverpages  Web  site   xml .coverpages.org  sgml-tex.html , where there is a focus on SGML. Here we will  pick  up  one  example  to  convert  XML  to   La TeX  content,  TeXML  www.alphaworks.ibm.com tech texml .  TeXML  encompasses  a  DTD   TeXML.dtd   and  a  corresponding  Java program  TeXMLatte.java  that parses the input conforming to the DTD and outputs TeX. XSLT is employed to transform an arbitrary XML docu- ment into one that conforms to the DTD.

Because XML allows the storage of information  in  a  presentation-neutral  format,  it  becomes  necessary  to  transform  this  content  into  a  presentation  format  such  as  HTML, WML, or PDF when clients ask for that information.  In this chapter we will give a short overview of XSLT, an  XML-based  transformation  language.  We  introduce  two  opposing  programming  styles  and  discuss  the  virtues  and  deﬁciencies of XSLT. Because XSLT draws heavily on XPath,  please refer to the discussion of XPath in Section 2.5.1.  XSLT has a reputation of not scaling very well. Although  this doesn’t matter for the purposes of prototyping and ad  hoc solutions, it is an issue when it comes to enterprise com-  puting. We will discuss performance problems and look for  alternatives.  351   352  Chapter 9 Transformation  Applications of XSLT  Dislikes  Historically  XSLT  was  a  part  of  the  XSL   Extensible  Stylesheet  Lan- guage  speciﬁcation, but then XSL was split into three parts: XPath, XSLT, and  Formatting  Objects   XFO . XSLT  is  now  a  recommendation  in  its own right  Clark 1999a . The purpose of XSLT is to enable style-sheet- controlled transformations from one XML document format into another document format  XML or non-XML, but mostly HTML .   When you think about it, XSLT can unleash substantial power:    XSLT  can  be  used  to  transform  presentation-neutral  XML  data  into presentational  formats  such  as  XHTML,  XForms,  WML,  SMIL,  SVG, and so on.    It can be used to convert document instances when a new version of a schema is introduced. It can be used to harvest RDF statements from the XLink elements in a document, or to generate XML Schema deﬁni- tions from XMI.    As we saw in Section 2.9, it can even be used to check the validity of  data against a set of constraints  Schematron and APEX .  Although XSLT is quite powerful, we have to say that not everybody likes  it.  One  commentator  even  described  it  as  an  “ugly,  difﬁcult  lan- guage”   Leventhal  1999 .  One  reason  for  such  dislike  is  that  XSLT  is  a rule-based, declarative language. Programmers who are used to impera- tive languages such as Java or C sometimes ﬁnd it hard to think in these terms. But also the inconsistent use of  source  document node sets and  result  tree fragments can be disturbing.  Another reason for this dislike is the syntax. The XSLT syntax itself is XML. This makes sense when you want to indulge in metaprogramming  i.e., apply XSLT transformations onto XSLT style sheets , but it can be difﬁcult  for  the  human  eye  to  read.  For  this  problem,  at  least  there  is help: Paul Tchistopolskii’s  www.pault.com  XSL Script has a much more legible syntax yet can be translated into 100% XSLT.  Usually, the XSLT control elements are preﬁxed with an identiﬁer for  the XSLT namespace. Here, we use the preﬁx xsl:.  9.1 PROCEDURAL TRANSFORMATION  Programming styles  There are two programming styles that can be used with XSLT. In the pro- cedural programming style, also known as the “pull” model, the program- mer  describes  to  the  XSLT  processor  exactly  what  to  do  and  in  which sequence. This programming style is easier to understand for program- mers  educated  in  imperative  languages  such  as  C  or  Pascal.  The  XSLT   9.1 Procedural Transformation  353  style  sheet  will  look  very  much  like  the  target  document,  with  inter- spersed XSLT instructions to ﬁll in the blanks. This technique has similar- ities to the programming approach used in Java Server Pages  JSP .  The rule-based programming style, also known as the “push” model, is a more declarative approach. Rules describe how the elements of the in- put document should be transformed. Rules are applied recursively based on a pattern-matching mechanism. Nonprogrammers and programmers educated in declarative languages such as PROLOG, expert systems, and so on should ﬁnd it easier to work in this way.  Of course, it is also possible to mix both programming styles. Procedural XSLT instructions include operations such as the following:    Control structures: XSLT instructions such as xsl:for-each, xsl:if, and xsl:choose provide procedural control structures like conditional exe- cution or loops. It is possible to sort the result of an xsl:for-each in- struction with an xsl:sort instruction. Additionally, the results can be numbered with the xsl:number instruction.    Accessing  content:  The xsl:value-of instruction  writes  the  content of the current node  or of an explicitly speciﬁed node  to the target document.    Call  by  name:  Named  templates  can  be  invoked  via  the  xsl:call- template instruction,  similarly  to  how  a  subroutine  is  invoked  in  a mainstream programming language. It is possible to pass parameters to these templates, but it is not possible to return result values.  Here is an XSLT example that converts the book order example from Chapter  2  into  some  HTML  using  the  procedural  programming  style. Figure 9.1 shows what we want to obtain.  Figure 9.2 shows how the resulting HTML document is compiled from  the original XML ﬁle with the help of an XSLT style sheet.  Procedural operations  Figure 9.1 Screen representation of a book order.   354  Chapter 9 Transformation  Figure 9.2 Generating output the procedural way. The XSLT style sheet determines the layout of the output document. Data is pulled out of the source document and placed into the appropriate slots in the output document.   9.2 Rule-Based Transformation  355  Rule-based operations  9.2 RULE-BASED TRANSFORMATION  With  rule-based  transformation,  the  main  XSLT  control  elements  are templates    . Each template consists of a head and a body. The head of a template decides on the context in which the template shall become active. This is done by using the attribute match= and spe- cifying an XPath expression to select the context nodes. The template body  describes  what  to  do.  This  is  speciﬁed  with  the  help  of  XSLT instructions.  The instruction xsl:apply-templates applies all templates deﬁned in the style sheet recursively but only to the nodes within the context se- lected by the select= attribute—template processing is applied recursively. xsl:apply-templates can  additionally  be  equipped  with  an  optional mode attribute. This allows the application of different sets of templates depending on context, since templates can also be equipped with a mode= attribute that must be matched.  It is possible to sort the result of an xsl:apply-templates instruction with an xsl:sort instruction. Additionally, the results can be numbered with the xsl:number instruction.  Procedural XSLT instructions  see earlier  can be used for conditional  processing or to write content to the target document.  In cases when the heads of several templates match a certain context,  the template with the best match is selected for execution:     Templates in the current style sheet win over templates from imported    The more speciﬁc a matching expression in the template head is, the  style sheets.   better is the match.  Figure  9.3  shows  a  rule-based  example  style  sheet  that  produces  the  same output as the previous procedural style sheet.  A rule-based style sheet usually contains a template rule that matches the root node  “ ” . In the root node rule we set up the global layout of the  target  document,  including  global  styles.  The  rule  then  applies  all rules recursively to the children of the root node.  The next rule applies to the   element. It outputs a header for the order and applies all the rules again to its children. The value of the   element is extracted with the xsl:value-of instruction.  The  next  rule  applies  to  the   element.  It  sets  up  a  table, outputs a table header, and applies all the rules again to its children. It then closes the table element.   356  Chapter 9 Transformation  Figure 9.3 In a rule-based style sheet the execution of templates is triggered by the elements of the source document as this document is processed. The sequence of elements in the output document thus depends on the sequence of elements in the original document. Note that the rule for element “item” still uses procedural techniques in order to change the order of elements.   9.3 What XSLT Can Do  357  Procedural vs. rule based  The next rule applies to   elements. For each item element it out-  puts a table row.  The last rule is used to disable XSLT’s built-in default rules. The effect of those rules is that the XSLT processor outputs text and attributes of all attributes that are not caught by a speciﬁc rule. In our case this is un- fortunate because we do not want to output the content of the   and   elements.  Therefore,  we  add  a  “catch-all”  rule  that  does nothing:      This  template  applies  when  no  other  template  applies  to  an  element  because its matching expression is the least speciﬁc one , so the default rules are never called.  Although both style sheets produce the same output, they actually de- ﬁne different transformations. We can see a difference when we rearrange the elements in the input document. If we placed the   element be- hind the   element, there would be no effect on the output document in the case of the procedural style sheet. In the case of the rule- based style sheet, however, the output Please note: . . . would appear af- ter the table. This is because in the rule-based style sheet the transforma- tion is deﬁned in a declarative manner. So, the input document drives the sequence of processing, and consequently the layout of the input docu- ment determines the layout of the output document. In the procedural style sheet, in contrast, the layout of the output document is determined by the layout of the style sheet.  9.3 WHAT XSLT CAN DO  In  this  section,  we  discuss  some  of  the  outstanding  features  of  XSLT. Later, in Section 9.4, we look into its weaknesses.  9.3.1 Variables  XSLT has variables; however, these variables are read-only variables. The value is assigned at the time the variable is deﬁned and cannot be modi- ﬁed afterward. Templates can specify variables as formal parameters, too, so that it is possible to pass parameters to templates.   Cross- references  Some XML documents make extensive use of cross-referencing. XSLT pro- vides  an  extra  construct  to  make  the  navigation  across  such  structures easier:  358  Chapter 9 Transformation  9.3.2 Keys  <xsl:key  name=”mykey” match=”  author” use=”@aid” >  This  construct  imposes  a  new  key  structure  onto  the  document.  We can then use this key in other XPath expressions: key “mykey”,”1”  name would result in the name of the author with @aid=”1”.  Y  9.3.3 Multiple Input Files  IO  The document   function allows access to additional documents by speci- fying their URI as a parameter.  F L  M  A  E  T  9.3.4 Various Output Methods  XSLT can transform an XML document tree structure into another XML document tree structure. This means that the input document must be a well-formed XML document, and, by default, the output document is a well-formed XML document, too.  However,  a  special  XSLT  instruction  allows  the  modiﬁcation  of  that  behavior:      is the default output method. The output document is a well-formed output document. Tags contained in the style sheet must obey the XML rules for well-formedness. An HTML tag   without a closing tag   would not be allowed. In contrast, the corresponding XHTML tag   would be allowed.      allows the speciﬁcation of HTML 4.0 tags in the style sheet, even if they violate the well-formedness of the style sheet. So it is possible to specify tags of empty elements such as   or   without a closing tag. This output method also keeps the strings in scripts  intact,  supports  minimized  attributes   attributes  without  a value , recognizes HTML tags regardless of case, and more. The input document, however, must always be well-formed XML.      strips all tags from the output, so that only the text contained in the elements of the output tree appears in  Team-Fly®   9.3 What XSLT Can Do  359  Schematron  the output document. This allows the creation of almost any output format,  as  long  as  it  is  text  output.  The  media-type attribute  can  be used to set the MIME type of the output ﬁle.  9.3.5 Metatransformations  XSLT is an XML-based language itself. This makes any XSLT style sheet a possible  subject  to  a  transformation  by  another  XSLT  style  sheet. This technique can be used to extend the XSLT language. Here are two examples:    We  have  already  described  Schematron  earlier  in  this  book   Section 2.9 . Schematron scripts are used to check XML instances for compli- ance  to  certain  constraints.  These  constraints  are  described  in  a Schematron script. After authoring the script it is compiled into a vali- dation style sheet. This is done with the Schematron compiler, which is nothing more than a predeﬁned XSLT style sheet. The resulting vali- dation style sheet, also an XSLT style sheet, is then applied to the XML document instances. The result of this transformation is a document containing a list of errors and warnings.    The loop compiler. Implemented by Oliver Becker  www.informatik.hu- berlin.de ~obecker XSLT loop-compiler , this XSLT preprocessor converts non-XSLT statements such as   from=”expression” to=”expression” step=”expression”>  <loop:for  ...    into standard XSLT expressions. Needless to say, the preprocessor is im- plemented as an XSLT style sheet.  More  examples  of  the  unorthodox  use  of  XSLT  are  found  at  the “Gallery  of  Stupid  XSL  and  XSLT  Tricks”  at  www.incrementaldevelopment .com  xsltrick .  9.3.6 Modules  XSLT  style  sheets  can  be  developed  in  modules.  Two  instructions— include and import—allow the combination of several style sheets into one.  While  include adds  the  included  style  sheet  to  the  current  style sheet, import allows the imported style sheet to override existing deﬁni- tions in the current style sheet.   360  Chapter 9 Transformation  No “real” variables  XSLT 1.1  Since all names in XSLT  such as template names, mode names, or key names  are qualiﬁed names  i.e., they can be speciﬁed with a namespace preﬁx ,  it  is  possible  to  avoid  name  clashes  when  style  sheets  are  im- ported or included.  9.4 WHAT XSLT CAN’T DO  While  in  many  cases  XSLT  allows  sophisticated  document  transforma- tions, there are other cases where the required transformations are met by restrictions:    There  is  no  destructive  assignment  for  variables  in  XSLT.  This  can make certain tasks  like counting  difﬁcult, especially for programmers with  a  background  in  procedural  programming.   The  destructive  as- signment can be simulated via recursive calls to templates, passing the updated value as a parameter with each call.     XSLT does not have a complete set of mathematical operators. For ex- ample, there are no built-in trigonometric functions and no random number generator. This can make some tasks tedious and error prone.   Because an XSLT style sheet is always a single document tree, we can- not split output into several ﬁles—a feature that is desperately needed when we want to convert a complex XML ﬁle into a set of interrelated XHTML, SVG, and SMIL ﬁles.   However, this issue is addressed in XSLT 1.1  Clark 2001 , which is currently  in  draft  status.  An  xsl:document instruction  will  allow  the redirection of the output stream.    XSLT  converts  an  input  document  into  an  output  document,  but it does  not  produce  a  binding  between  both.  This  is  ﬁne  for  mere representation purposes, but it does not really support user interactiv- ity.  For  example,  we  can  easily  write  a  style  sheet  that  converts  a representation-neutral XML ﬁle into an XForms ﬁle, but we have no way to map the user input back to the original XML ﬁle.  Section 4.4.2 discussed how this is still possible.   9.5 EXTENSIONS  These limitations are asking for an extension technique, which XSLT for- tunately  provides.  Several  XSLT  processors  exist  that  allow  extensions, most notably Michael Kay’s Saxon  Kay 2001  and Xalan from the Apache Group.   9.5 Extensions  361  However, although the extension technique is standardized, the exten- sion implementation is not standardized, so you have to decide on a spe- ciﬁc processor and stay with that processor. The good news is that there are community efforts to create a standard set of extensions: have a look at www.exslt.org.  XSLT extensions come in three ﬂavors:   Extension ﬂavors    Extension attributes. Extension attributes can be used to inﬂuence the behavior of the XSLT processor. For example, an extension attribute may be used to switch on the processor’s trace function.    Extension elements. Extension elements perform actions by calling an extension routine. For example, an extension element can redirect the output stream, so that it becomes possible to create several output ﬁles from one style sheet. Extension elements may contain attributes, text nodes, and child elements. This content is passed to the associated ex- tension routine. Values that are returned to the extension element are inserted into the result tree.    Extension functions. Extension functions are called in the same way as XSLT core library functions are called. Function arguments are passed to the associated extension routine, and the value returned by the rou- tine is passed back as the function result.  Several XSLT processors support extensions, most notably Saxon and Xalan.  The  Saxon  XSLT  processor  is  well  renowned  for  its  robustness, speed, and extensibility. It is also one of the few processors that supports the XSLT key construct. It is freely available at users.iclway.co.uk mhkay  saxon . Saxon allows the implementation of extension elements, exten- sion attributes, and extension functions in the form of Java classes. The Saxon package comes with a rich collection of built-in extensions.  Xalan  uses  the  Bean  Scripting  Framework   BDF   to  incorporate  ex- tension  routines.  This  allows  independence  from  particular  scripting languages.  Thus,  Xalan  supports  a  wide  range  of  scripting  languages such as Mozilla Rhino, NetRexx, BML, JPython, Jacl, JScript, VBScript, or PerlScript. In addition, it is possible to call methods of Java objects, too.  Here is a simple example of a Xalan extension function:    <xsl:stylesheet  xmlns:xsl=”http:  www.w3.org 1999 XSL Transform” version=”1.0” xmlns:lxslt=”http:  xml.apache.org xslt” xmlns:my-ext=”ext1” extension-element-prefixes=”my-ext”>  Saxon  Xalan   362  Chapter 9 Transformation  <!—lxslt:component defines the JavaScript   extension function —>  <lxslt:component prefix=”my-ext”   functions=”logscale”>     function logscale x  { return Math.ln parseInt x  *Math.LOG10E*20; }     <rect style=”stroke:green;fill:lightgreen”  x=”100” y=”400” width=”50”>             ...           ...     The lxslt:component element deﬁnes all extension components, in this case  only  one  function   log .  This  must  be  declared  in  the  functions attribute. This function accepts one argument and adjusts it to a logarith- mic scale. The function is then used in the template that matches sales- figure.  Here  we  generate  an  SVG  element  to  draw  a  rectangle.  We  see how we can use the XSLT instruction xsl:attribute to dynamically cre- ate an attribute for element  .  Here is a simple example of ﬁle redirection:                       This template matches the   element in our bookOrder example. For the whole processing of this element it redirects the output stream to   9.7 Performance Aspects  363  a ﬁle called envelope.xml. After the element has been processed, the out- put  stream  is  switched  back  to  its  previous  destination.   The  redirect extension is a predeﬁned extension shipped with the Xalan package.   9.6 AUTHORING AND TESTING OF XSL STYLE SHEETS  There  are  quite  a  few  XSLT  authoring  tools.  The  W3C  XSLT  Web  site lists a comprehensive set of them. We can classify these tools into three categories:    Generic  XSLT  editors:  These  editors  allow  the  writing  of  XSLT  style sheets. The XSLT code is checked for correctness, and the style sheet can be tested against existing XML documents. These editors require a good knowledge of XSLT.  One  prominent  example  is  IBM’s  XSL  editor,  which  is  available under  the  usual  90-day  license  from  the  alphaworks  Web  site.  Im- plemented  in  Java,  this  tool  allows  the  display  of  the  source  docu- ment, the style sheet, and the resulting output side by side. All three documents can be viewed in text mode and tree mode. A debugger al- lows the tracing of the execution of the style sheet and the setting of breakpoints.    Visual XSLT editors: These editors are targeted toward the creation of style sheets that transform XML into HTML. The target HTML docu- ment is composed by visual means  similarly to how it is done in a vi- sual HTML editor . The author associates these display elements with the elements of the source XML document. The tool generates XML templates appropriately. In most cases authors will not have to write XSLT. Typical examples of such tools are eXcelon’s Stylus, Whitehill’s  Composer, and XML Spy  all commercial products .    Generic  XSLT  generators:  These  tools  allow  the  association  of  the  ele- ments of source documents and target documents with the help of a mapping function. Users can select from a variety of available map- ping functions. The tool will then create appropriate XSLT style sheets. An example of such a tool is XSLerator, again from alphaworks.  9.7 PERFORMANCE ASPECTS   The ﬁrst XSLT processors, such as James Clark’s XT, were implemented in Java using the DOM API  see Section 2.8.2 . These processors are quite resource  hungry  because  any  node  in  the  input  document  and  in  the  XT   364  Chapter 9 Transformation  Saxon  Xalan  Sablotron  Sun’s XSLT compiler  Compiling to C++  Caching  style sheet is represented by a ﬁrst-class object. However, XT is still one of the fastest XSLT processors around, especially when large documents are to be transformed.   But Saxon also seems to have kept pace. By using caching techniques for transformed pages, performance levels better than obtained with Java Server Pages  JSP  technology have been reported.  The  Xalan  processor   also  implemented  in  Java   reduces  the  object- oriented  overhead  by  representing  XML  nodes  with  integer  array  ele- ments instead of full objects, thus requiring far fewer resources.   C++  implementations  such  as  Sablotron  and  Informiix  generally achieve  a  better  performance  than  Java  implementations  when  small documents are processed, with Sablotron slightly outperforming XT for large documents, too.  Sun Microsystems, in the meantime, has developed an XSLT compiler. The compiler takes an XSLT style sheet as input and generates a hierarchy of  Java  classes,  packed  into  a  “translet.”  This  translet  will  then  accept XML documents as input, apply the speciﬁed transformations, and de- liver output documents. The compiler covers virtually all of the XSLT 1.0 speciﬁcation, but it has only limited support for extension and cannot split the output into several ﬁles.   Performance improvements by a factor of 2–3 can be expected. In one case reported, the time to transform a large document was reduced from 8 minutes  obtained with an interpreting XSLT processor  to 25 seconds  i.e., a factor of 19 .  Sun has donated the XSLT compiler to the Apache organization, where it has become part of the Xalan distribution. The compiler, however, can- not handle extensions in the way Xalan does.  Another development is the XSLT compiler by Olivier Gerardin. This compiler translates XSLT style sheets into C++ classes with similar perfor- mance  gains.  This  compiler  is  available  under  the  GNU  license  from www3.cybercities.com x xsltc .  Although performance gains can be achieved by the selection of the right XSLT processor, the best performance gains in heavy trafﬁc situa- tions are achieved via caching. XML documents are transformed into the target format such as HTML when requested, but the result of the trans- formation is stored in a cache. Subsequent requests that access the same document are served directly from the cache. However, update operations to  the  original  XML  document  must  be  carried  forward  to  the  cached transformations.   9.8 Other Languages  365  9.8 OTHER LANGUAGES  XSLT is not the only way to transform an XML document. Transforma- tion is also possible with general-purpose languages such as Java, C, C++, Pascal, SmallTalk, Eiffel, Visual Basic, JavaScript, and so on—even with assembler, if you really want. Some of these languages have access to SAX or DOM APIs that reduce the effort to parse the XML document. In par- ticular,  Java  has  the  most  complete  XML  support,  as  virtually  all  new implementations of XML processors are done in Java ﬁrst.   Then there are the languages that feature strong pattern-matching fa- cilities. In particular, languages with good support for regular expressions are well suited to process XML. Here are a few examples.  General-purpose languages  Languages with pattern matching  9.8.1 Omnimark  Omnimark  is  a  commercial  product  by  stilo  that  is  designed  for  docu- ment transformation. It has strong support for XML and can transform non-XML to XML and vice versa. Several packages exist to support bulk document translation, client-server situations, SOAP, and BizTalk.  9.8.2 Perl  There  is  a  rich  ensemble  of  XML-related  modules   including  SAX  and DOM APIs  in the public Perl libraries  CPAN . Several modules deal with document transformation. Some are for speciﬁc transformations; others provide generic transformations similar to XSLT:    GXML   Generic  XML  Transformation  Tool   is  one.  According  to  the author, Josh Carter, “GXML is a perl module for transforming XML. It may be put to a variety of tasks; in scope it is similar to XSL, but less ambitious.” The good thing is that this processor provides an exten- sion mechanism via a callback mechanism, allowing the execution of Perl expressions at the start and end of each XML tag.    An  XSLT  processor   XML::XSLT   has  been  implemented  in  Perl  by  Geert Josten, Egon Willighagen, and Mark A. Hershberger.     Other options  with a better performance  are Perl wrappers for C++ transformation  engines  such  as  XML::Sablotron  and  XML::Informix.   XML::Pyx is a simple event-oriented parser  i.e., similar to SAX . The client is informed about tags and the content of elements and can re- act accordingly.   366  Chapter 9 Transformation    XML::Simple works in a similar way as DOM. It parses the entire XML ﬁle and loads it into a tree structure in memory. It does not work well for complex document-centric XML, but it works well for simple data- centric XML.    XML::XPath is a Perl module for parsing and evaluating XPath expres-  sions that conform to the W3C’s XPath recommendation.   9.8.3 XDuce  Some functional languages such as Clean, Haskell  HaXML , ML, O’Caml, and XMLambda support XML. As one example from this group, we will brieﬂy discuss XDuce  pronounced “transduce” , a research project at the University of Pennsylvania  Hosoya and Pierce 2000 . It is a functional language based on the principles of ML but extended with the ability to utilize  regular  expressions  for  pattern  matching  and  to  recognize  XML elements as datatypes. As regular expressions closely resemble structures that  can  be  deﬁned  with  a  DTD,  it  is  quite  easy  to  formulate  complex document transformations in XDuce.  Given the DTD              the following XDuce program converts an address book document into a phone list document:  fun mkTelList :  Name,Addr,Tel? * –>  Name,Tel * = name[n:String], addr[a:String], tel[t:String],  –> name[n], tel[t], mkTelList rest    name[n:String], addr[a:String], rest: Name,Addr,Tel? *  rest: Name,Addr,Tel? *  –> mkTelList rest        –>     Strongly typed languages  Functional languages are usually strongly typed, and so is XDuce. Any document node establishes its own datatype  this is in fact very close to the concept of complex types in XML Schema . Types are carried across   9.9 Generating Web Pages  367  function deﬁnitions, and consequently the function mkTelList has the type of “Function mapping address book to phone list,” which is declared in the ﬁrst line of the program.   The processing is recursive: the whole address book is matched against a regular expression. While the left arguments of that expression match the constituents of one address book entry, the rest of the address book is matched against the rest: Name,Addr,Tel? * expression and is processed subsequently. There are three alternatives: one for address book entries with a phone number, one for entries without a phone number, and one for the empty list. The respective results are assembled on the right side of the arrow operator.    The functional paradigm seems to be better suited for document trans- formation than the rule-based  and sometimes surprising  mechanism in XSLT.    Functional languages are strongly typed and use static type checking at  compile time. This prevents many nasty surprises at runtime.    The integration of XML transformations into a computationally com-  plete language makes an extra extension mechanism obsolete.  Statically typed languages such as XDuce and others with type systems that can support the XML information set seem to be a very promising approach. However, this area is still very much a research topic.  There are three advantages to this approach:  Advantages  9.9 GENERATING WEB PAGES  XSLT is not the only way to present XML data as HTML. There are several other techniques that are based on HTML and that can pull XML content into Web pages.  Sun Microsystem’s Java Server Pages   java.sun.com products jsp  allows the embedding of Java directives into HTML pages. These directives are executed when a page is requested. XML data can be accessed from these directives using a Java API such as DOM or SAX.  Anakia is a similar technology in the context of Apache’s Jakarta proj- ect   jakarta.apache.org . Anakia uses JDOM and Velocity to embed XML content into Web pages.  XSP   eXtensible  Server  Pages   combines  dynamic  generation  and transformation with XSLT style sheets. XSP is Cocoon’s  also an Apache  Java Server Pages  Anakia  XSP   368  Chapter 9 Transformation  project; see Section 11.5.1  technology for dynamically generated XML. Similar  to  Java  Server  Pages,  XSP  includes  directives  that  are  executed when an XSP page is requested. This results in a rendered XML docu- ment. This document can then be processed further with an XSLT style sheet.  Y  F L  M  A  E  T  Team-Fly®   Infrastructure  10  10.1 Business  Requirements  10.2 Web Services  10.3 ebXML  “Web services” has been the latest catch phrase out  of the marketing departments of the IT industry.  Despite the hype, Web services are important building blocks  10.4 Industry Vocabularies  for  Internet  applications.  Architectures  such  as  Hewlett-  Packard’s e-speak, Sun Microsystem’s ONE, Microsoft’s .NET,  or ebXML all rely on Web services. In Section 10.2, we take a  closer look at this technology.  In Section 10.3, we move the discussion to ebXML. This  standard, authored by UN CEFACT and OASIS and adopted  by major industry associations such as OTA or Covisint, com-  bines the experience of the EDI community with the ﬂexibil-  ity of XML. This leads to new and innovative solutions, such  as the negotiation of shared business processes or the treat-  ment  of  context,  from  which  we  can  learn  a  lot.  It  will  be  interesting  comparing  ebXML  with  BizTalk,  which  is  dis-  cussed in Chapter 11.  369   370  Chapter 10 Infrastructure  Finally,  we  list  some  of  the  most  important  XML  industry  vocabularies,  such as SyncML, DocBook, FpML, HL7, and many more.   10.1 BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS  Business-to-business communication requires infrastructure and interme- diaries. Intermediaries like marketplaces, exchanges, auctions, and so on provide transparency in an otherwise chaotic world. Just as in the real world, where markets, real estate agents, and other intermediaries pro- vide  transparency,  Internet  B2B  intermediaries  provide  transparency regarding price, product features, availability, and supplier characteristics  Anant and Pandya 2001 .  In the current stage of the Internet such intermediaries take the form of online exchanges, markets, portals, auctions, reverse auctions, and so on. They simply bring buyer and supplier together and assist in the pro- cess of matching request and offer. They support the search for products or product requests and help in the conﬁguration of products. For buyers, such intermediaries offer the chance to ﬁnd a supplier with a better price or  product.  Suppliers  beneﬁt  from  a  larger  group  of  potential  buyers. Typical  examples  of  intermediaries  are  companies  such  as  VerticalNet, Chemdex  now Ventro , Commerce One, and Ariba. Some marketplaces were founded by interested industry sectors such as the automotive in- dustry and retail sectors. Both of these sectors have a long-standing expe- rience  with  one-to-one  data  exchange  via  EDI  but  have  moved  into many-to-many Internet-based marketplaces. For example, the Global Net Exchange is an initiative by Sears, Carrefour, Sainsbury, and others; the competing Worldwide Retail Exchange is an initiative by Kmart, Target, Walgreens, Tesco, Auchan, Casino, and others; and the Grocery Manufac- turers’ Association’s eCPG is an initiative by P&G, Unilever, Kraft Foods, and others.   Traditionally, online interchange between trading partners has been a bilateral affair. EDI  Electronic Data Interchange  requires each trade part- nership to be negotiated separately. Within the next few years B2B trade will move quickly from a one-to-one model to a many-to-many relation- ship. According to Forrester Research:  Online,  bilateral  trade—between  two  companies—will  more  than  triple  by 2004  to  nearly  $1.3  trillion,  but  the  volume  of  trade  through  the  market- places will surge from a tiny fraction of that number today to over half of online trade by 2004.  Intermediaries  EDI   10.2 Web Services  371  Many of the current online exchanges are the result of interested in- dustry groups. The result is that several similar exchanges operate within the same market sector as competitors. In the next few years we will see these exchanges grow together. Marketplaces will acquire the ability to link with other marketplaces. These metamarkets will provide even better transparency.  Marketplaces  10.2 WEB SERVICES  An  online  exchange  or  marketplace  is,  however,  just  a  special  form  of Web service. Other intermediaries specialize in services such as credit card checks,  ﬁnancing,  and  fulﬁllment.  Nearly  every  day,  we  see  additional Web services come into existence—Web services that not only support the buying selling process but that support other business processes, too. Even manufacturing could be offered as a Web service  and this is almost the case in virtual enterprises .  In the end, shrink-wrapped software packages could become an endan- gered species  at least in the standard ofﬁce environment —or rather an augmented species.  Standard  software  will  increasingly  integrate  Web  services.  Web  ser- vices can range from very simple services to rather complex ones. Here are a few examples of basic Web services: stock quotes, currency conver- sion,  fetching  articles  from  an  archive,  email  sender,  language  transla- tion, generating a UUID, real-time ﬂight information, storage system for XML documents, conversion between XML vocabularies, checking HTML pages  for  accessibility,  shared  address  book,  FedEx  tracker,  eBay  price watcher, and registering and ﬁnding a Web service in a directory.  A list of such  services  and  their  descriptions  is  found  at  www.xmethods.com.   It seems that such Web services can add substantial value to existing stan- dard software packages.  All of the big players in the industry have announced their own Web service  strategy.  The  merit  of  being  the  ﬁrst  goes  to  Hewlett-Packard, which  formulated  a  quite  complete,  albeit  proprietary,  solution  with  e-speak. They were followed by IBM with its Web service strategy. Sun Microsystems followed suit with Sun ONE. Then Microsoft added a sub- stantial push to Web services with its .NET initiative, and recently with its project Hailstorm.  With SOAP  see Section 6.5.2 , WSDL  Section 6.6.3 , and UDDI  Sec- tion 7.3 , there is now a framework for message transport, protocol deﬁ- nition,  and  service  registration  and  recovery  in  place.  This  allows  the  An extinct species?  The big players  SOAP, WSDL, UDDI   372  Chapter 10 Infrastructure  wide-scale application of Web services, just as TCP IP, HTTP, and HTML were the prerequisites for the expansion of the World Wide Web. The in- tegration of SOAP into Microsoft’s Windows operating systems, the sup- port of SOAP by Apache.org, and the support of XML, SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI  by  Sun  Microsystem’s  Java  programming  language  will  facilitate this.  10.2.1 Orchestration The  inclusion  of  Web  services  into  a  business  process  can  be  achieved with varying degrees of automation:    Manual  invocation  of  Web  services  via  a  generic  Web  service  client   similar to a Web browser .    Invocation of Web services in the context of a traditional application. For example, a spreadsheet package could fetch stock quotes via a Web service  and  could  then  invoke  another  Web  service  to  convert  the quote into another currency.    Invocation  in  the  context  of  a  custom-designed  business  process. Microsoft’s  BizTalk  Orchestration  is  an  example  of  this   see  Section 11.3.3 .     Semi- automatic  localization  of  Web  services  and   semi- automatic negotiation of business processes. ebXML is an example  see Section 10.3 .  In the ﬁrst two cases business processes are driven by the human operator. In the last two cases, business processes run autonomously in a workﬂow- like fashion, with human assistance becoming just another service.  10.2.2 Availability As Web services are accessed via the Web, they are subject to intermittent availability. A service may not be available for a period of time due to downtime of the server or system overload.   Business processes that use Web services have to decide what to do in such cases: wait until the service becomes available again, try to locate another  equivalent  service,  or  report  a  failure  of  service.  This  requires business rules that are able to describe alternatives and that are able to compromise on less-than-optimal solutions.  10.2.3 Collaboration Instead of Integration Web services can be business processes, too. In some cases  especially in most of the services mentioned earlier , these processes are just simple  BizTalk  ebXML  Finding alternatives   10.2 Web Services  373  stateless request response type services. In other cases a Web service can offer a more complex interface involving several requests and responses depending on the current state of the service process. Therefore we speak of “business process collaboration.”  Conceptually, these processes are communicating sequential processes  Hoare 1985 . They require not only the deﬁnition of the format for re- quests and responses but also the deﬁnition of the process behavior. This is usually done in the form of a state transition table or a Petri net  but see Chapters 5 and 6 for a discussion .  10.2.4 Transactions  For business processes that consist of several services, process integrity be- comes an issue. When one service fails, what should we do with the other services?   To run such a process properly, a transactional concept  see also Sec- tion 6.6  is required. This transaction concept differs from the classical database transaction concept  ACID . A suitable transaction concept for Web services is the concept of long-running  or long-lived  transactions. Transactional  Web  services  are  required  to  offer  compensating  actions  that can semantically undo a previous action  in order to support this transaction concept.  A business process that includes several Web services can be offered as a Web service itself and can thus be embedded into a larger business pro- cess. This technique allows for a high degree of modularity and special- ization, and at the same time for arbitrarily large and complex processes. ebXML   see  Section  10.3 ,  for  example,  explicitly  uses  nested  business processes to construct processes that involve more than two partners. For example, a process to make a reservation for a trip to Venice involves sev- eral subprocesses: one subprocess to book the ﬂight, one to arrange for a hotel, and one to charter a gondola. If one of these processes fails, addi- tional processes are needed to roll back  or compensate  the others.  Communicating sequential processes  Long-running transactions  Nested Web services  10.2.5 Software Engineering  Especially  for  supply  chain  integration,  Web  services  can  be  combined into processes that span the complete life cycle process of a product and its parts. The resulting network from interrelated and collaborating busi- ness  processes  will  exceed  the  complexity  of  traditional  enterprise  IT infrastructures.  This  requires  software  engineering  techniques  for  the management, scalability, security, and auditing of business process col- laborations—techniques that are, today, still in their infancy.  Complexity   374  Chapter 10 Infrastructure  Semantic maps  Added value  10.2.6 Service Localization  When we look at the different parties involved in Web services, we can identify three roles:    Web service provider: The service provider has to decide what to offer as a  Web  service,  how  to  describe  these  services,  and  where  to  publish these descriptions. In Section 6.6.3 we discussed WSDL, a standard to describe Web services.    Web service consumer: Service consumers ﬁrst have to formulate their re- quirements, then have to try to discover a service that satisﬁes these re- quirements. In order to do so, they must understand the description of the service and negotiate a communication protocol with the service.   Web  service  broker:  Service  brokers  help  the  providers  and  the  con- sumers get together. They provide repositories that contain the service descriptions. These repositories contain white and yellow pages that list services by name and by service type. In Section 7.3, we discussed UDDI,  a  standard  that  deﬁnes  the  registration  of  Web  services  in repositories.  However, just a list of addresses and descriptions will only be of lim- ited help. Crucial for service brokers is to provide sound taxonomies for Web services. A good taxonomy will help service consumers to un- derstand the semantics of a service. Semantic navigation in the form of a semantic map  for instance, a topic map; see Section 7.2  will help to locate the right service.   In addition, Web brokers can offer auxiliary services, too. For exam- ple, they can gather statistics  which services are wanted most, and by whom . They can arrange for payment of services. They can even for- ward requests to other brokers. Thus Web service brokers provide Web services themselves.  Web services thus dissolve the classical client-server architecture into individual  services  that  are  scattered  across  the  Web.  They  will  rely heavily on peer-to-peer communication and on sophisticated semantic navigation techniques that allow consumers to ﬁnd the right service. Or will the services begin to hunt the Web for possible consumers?  10.3 ebXML  ebXML may well be the most important development for electronic busi- ness in a long time. Started as an initiative of UN CEFACT and OASIS, ebXML combines the industry’s rich experience with EDI, the ﬂexibility   10.3 ebXML  375  of  XML,  the  reusability  of  component-oriented  systems,  and  ground- breaking work in the treatment of context. According to Carol Geyer of Oasis:  Members of the Global Commerce Initiative  GCI  announced plans to use ebXML as the backbone of their new data exchange standard for business-to- business trade in the consumer goods industry. . . . GCI members include 40 major manufacturers and retailers as well as eight trade associations, which in total  represent  850,000  companies  around  the  world.  Exchanges  such  as Transora, the WorldWide Retail Exchange, GlobalNetXchange, and CPGmar- ket.com are taking active roles in the GCI development.  In  early  2002,  other  industry  alliances,  such  as  the  Open  Travel  Al- liance  OTA  and Covisint, joined the ebXML initiative. For the business world,  ebXML  is  probably  the  most  important  standard  since  XML. ebXML not only deﬁnes a global nonproprietary standard to exchange data between businesses, but it also introduces an infrastructure that sup- ports collaborative business processes. This infrastructure enables ebXML to automate much of the process of locating and establishing business partnerships, in particular, where companies previously have not done business with each other.  In the ﬁrst phase, ebXML will not replace existing EDI EDIFACT solu- tions. Large corporations already have EDI EDIFACT solutions in place, and according to the rule “if it ain’t broke, don’t ﬁx it,” these solutions will hardly be replaced at ﬁrst sight. Thus, ebXML will initially exist in ar- eas where EDI EDIFACT is not in place  such as small businesses , but also where EDI EDIFACT solutions must be integrated with other solutions.  EDI will stay  10.3.1 Basic Concepts  From Oasis  2002 :  ebXML . . . is built on three basic concepts: provide an infrastructure that ensures data communication interoperability; provide a semantics framework that  ensures  commercial  interoperability;  and  provide  a  mechanism  that allows enterprises to ﬁnd each other, agree to become trading partners and conduct business with each other.  The infrastructure is provided through a standard message transport mechanism, a well-deﬁned interface, packaging rules, and a predictable delivery  and  security  model.  The  speciﬁcation  allows  any  application- level protocol to be used for message transport, including common pro- tocols such as SMTP, HTTP, FTP, and SOAP. An interface for business ser- vices handles messages at either end of the transport.  Message transport   376  Chapter 10 Infrastructure  Semantic framework  Shared repositories  The heart of ebXML  Registration  Discovery  Negotiation  The semantic framework includes a metamodel for deﬁning business process and information models, reusable core components that reﬂect common  business  processes  and  XML  vocabularies,  and  a  process  for deﬁning actual message structures and deﬁnitions as they relate to the ac- tivities in the business process model.   The  mechanism  for  discovery,  agreement,  and  collaboration  is  pro- vided  through  shared  repositories   OASIS  2001f   where  enterprises  can register and discover each other’s business services via collaborative partner proﬁles  CPP , a process for deﬁning and agreeing to a formal collaboration protocol  agreement  CPA ,  and  a  shared  repository  for  company  proﬁles, business  process  models,  and  related  message  structures.  ebXML  can make use of UDDI to locate registries and repositories  OASIS 2001e .  10.3.2 Shared Repositories  The shared repositories  ebXML registry  for company proﬁles, business process models, and related message structures are the pivot points within the ebXML architecture.   When  a  company—let’s  call  it  Nuts  &  Bolts—plans  to  build  its  own ebXML-compliant application, it ﬁrst reviews existing ebXML repositories  step  1  in  Figure  10.1 .   However,  the  use  of  repositories  is  optional. ebXML relationships can also be negotiated between two parties directly.  Utilizing the reusable components stored in the repositories, Nuts & Bolts will set up its own ebXML-compliant application  step 2 . The company will then register the implementation details and its own company busi- ness proﬁle in an ebXML registry  step 3 . This proﬁle describes Nuts & Bolts’  ebXML  capabilities  and  constraints,  and  the  supported  business scenarios. The registry then checks if format and usage of the business sce- narios are correct and sends an acknowledgment to Nuts & Bolts.  Now a company called Doors & Windows is looking for a supplier of hardware. Doors & Windows discovers Nuts & Bolts in the ebXML reg- istry  step 4 . They ﬁnd that the business scenarios supported by Nuts & Bolts satisfy their requirements. Doors & Windows decides not to imple- ment its own ebXML application but to buy an ebXML-compliant shrink- wrapped application. After installation of that package, they download the CPP of Nuts & Bolts  step 5  and construct a CPA by computing an in- tersection of the downloaded CPP and their own CPP  step 6 . This can be done manually or automatically.   The resulting CPA is then proposed directly to Nuts & Bolts’ ebXML- compliant  software  interface  for  further  negotiation   step  7 .  The  CPA outlines  which  business  scenarios  both  companies  agree  on  plus  some   10.3 ebXML  377  1. Review contents.  ebXML  Repository  Nuts and Bolts  3. Register CPP.  2.

In particular, the CPA contains information about mes- saging requirements for transactions, the conversations that take place in a collaborative  business  process,  contingency  plans,  and  security-related requirements. After Nuts & Bolts accepts the business agreement, both companies are ready to engage in e-business using ebXML  step 8 .  The ebXML architecture is in part inﬂuenced by the Open-edi Refer- ence  Model,  ISO IEC  14662.  The  Open-edi  reference  model   ISO IEC 1997  was released by the International Organization for Standardization  ISO  and the International Electrotechnical Commission  IEC  in 1997. The Open-edi model is generic—it does not deﬁne an operational stan- dard but serves as the basis for the work between the different agencies involved in EDI standardization.  Open-edi makes a clear distinction between the business operational view   business  rules   and  the  functional  service  view   interoperability  Open-edi   378  Chapter 10 Infrastructure  CPP in detail  rules . Business scenarios can be deﬁned and registered by business com- munities. Users can thus reuse existing scenarios instead of negotiating all the details from scratch. Each scenario consists of the following:    Roles: A role deﬁnes a partner involved in a business scenario.   Information bundles: Information bundles describe formally the seman- tics of the information exchanged between the parties involved in a business scenario.    Semantic  components:  Information  bundles  are  constructed  using  se- mantic  components.  A  semantic  component  is  a  unit  of  unambigu- ously deﬁned information in the context of the business goal of the business transaction.    Scenario  attributes:  Scenario  attributes  describe  information  indepen-  Y  dent of roles or information bundles.  The dynamic aspects of scenarios are deﬁned using existing formal meth- ods such as state transition diagrams or Petri nets.  The CPP is part of the trading partners proﬁle  TPP   OASIS 2001a . It de- ﬁnes the capabilities of a single partner in terms of becoming engaged in business with other partners. The speciﬁcations of the CPP form a layered architecture:  E  A  F L  M    Process speciﬁcation: This is the top layer of the speciﬁcations and de- ﬁnes the services  business transactions  offered to other partners, as well as the transition rules that determine the valid sequence of service requests. These deﬁnitions are made in the separate process speciﬁca- tion document  see below . This document is referenced by both CPP and CPA.    Delivery channels: This layer describes the message-receiving character- istics of a party. One CPP can contain several delivery channels. Each channel consists of one document exchange deﬁnition and one trans- port deﬁnition.    Document exchange layer: This layer processes business documents ac- cepted from the process speciﬁcation layer at one party. If speciﬁed, the documents are encrypted and digital signatures are added  see Sec- tion 6.8 . The document is then passed to the transport layer for trans- mission  to  the  other  party.  When  documents  are  received  from  the other party, the inverse steps are performed. The document exchange layer complements the services offered by the transport layer. If, for ex- ample,  the  selected  transport  protocol  does  not  provide  encryption, but message security is required, then encryption must be speciﬁed at the document exchange layer.  T  Team-Fly®   10.3 ebXML  379  The protocol for exchanging messages is deﬁned by the ebXML mes-  saging service speciﬁcation or other similar messaging services.     Transport layer: This layer is responsible for message delivery. The trans- port protocol can be speciﬁed—the choice may affect the choices se- lected for the document exchange layer. For example, some protocols may provide authentication and encryption, while others don’t.  Here is a CPP example:  <CollaborationProtocolProfile  xmlns=”http:  www.ebxml.org namespaces tradePartner” xmlns:bpm=”http:  www.ebxml.org namespaces businessProcess” xmlns:ds=”http:  www.w3.org 2000 09 xmldsig” xmlns:xlink=”http:  www.w3.org 1999 xlink”>       …     …                          …    <DeliveryChannel channelId=”…” transportId=”…”   docExchangeId=”…”>  <Characteristics  nonrepudiationOfOrigin = “true” nonrepudiationOfReceipt = “true” secureTransport = “true” confidentiality = “true” authenticated = “true” authorized = “true” >          …        380  Chapter 10 Infrastructure   …                    …   <ReliableMessaging deliverySemantics=”…”  idempotency=”false” persistDuration=”…”>   …     …           …     …     …             …     …          …               ...     text      CPP elements  Besides  the  namespace  deﬁnitions  for  trade  partners,  business  pro- cesses, signatures, and XLink, and optional elements for signature speciﬁ- cation and comments, a CPP document contains at least one PartyInfo element. Each of these contains the following:   10.3 ebXML  381    At least one PartyId element deﬁning a logical identiﬁer for the party,  for example, a URI.    At least one PartyRef element specifying a link  URI  to additional in- formation about the party, for example, a URL pointing to the party’s Web site, a UDDI or ebXML repository, or an LDAP directory.    At least one CollaborationRole element deﬁning the role of the party within a business process. Child elements identify the certiﬁcate to be used for this role, the business process to which the role belongs, and the  role  the  party  plays  within  this  process   for  example,  buyer  or seller .  Each  CollaborationRole contains ServiceBinding elements  to bind the role to main and alternative delivery channels. Override ele- ments can specify different channels for speciﬁc actions, for example, for acknowledgments or express messages.    At least one Certificate element identifying the certiﬁcate to be used  in this CPP.    At least one DeliveryChannel element. Each delivery channel identiﬁes one Transport element and one DocExchange element and contains a Characteristics element that speciﬁes several channel attributes.    At least one Transport element. Each of these contains child elements to specify the protocol used  HTTP, SMTP, FTP, SOAP , the channel end points, and security settings  protocol, certiﬁcate . There are different types of channel end points: login, request, response, error, allPurpose.  In  addition,  each  PartyInfo element  also  contains  at  least  one  Doc- Exchange element. Each of these deﬁnes the properties of a messaging ser- vice to be used. Each DocExchange element contains an ebXMLBinding ele- ment that describes properties speciﬁc to the ebXML Message Service:    MessageEncoding speciﬁes the encoding standard used for the transmis-  sion, such as BASE64.    ReliableMessaging describes the properties for reliable ebXML message exchange. The deliverySemantics attribute can take the values “Once- AndOnlyOnce”  or  “BestEffort”   no  reliable  messaging .  The  idempo- tency attribute can take the values “true” and “false”. If set to “true”, all messages are subject to an idempotency test ensuring that message duplicates are discarded.  Messages could be duplicated when message transmission is retried or restarted after an exception has happened.  The value of the persistDuration attribute is the minimum length of time a message should be kept in persistent storage. The Retries and RetryInterval child elements specify how often and in which intervals message transmissions should be repeated after a timeout.   382  Chapter 10 Infrastructure    The NonRepudiation element allows the proof of who sent a message and prevents later repudiation. Nonrepudiation is based on the XML digital signature  see Section 6.8 . The Protocol child element identi- ﬁes the technology used to digitally sign a message, such as XMLDSIG. The HashFunction child element identiﬁes the algorithm used for mes- sage digest. The SignatureAlgorithm child element identiﬁes the digital signature algorithm. The CertificateRef child element refers to one of the Certificate elements elsewhere within the CPP.    The DigitalEnvelope element speciﬁes a symmetric encryption proce- dure.  The shared secret key is sent to the message recipient encrypted with the recipient’s public key.  The Protocol child element identiﬁes the  security  protocol  to  be  used,  for  example,  S MIME.  The  Encryp- tionAlgorithm child element identiﬁes the encryption algorithm to be used. The CertificateRef child element refers to one of the Certifi- cate elements elsewhere within the CPP or CPA.    The NamespaceSupported element lists any namespace extensions sup- ported by the implementation, such as Security Services Markup Lan- guage or Transaction Authority Markup Language.  10.3.3 Contracts in ebXML  CPA in detail  The CPA is part of the trading partners agreement  TPA   OASIS 2001a . A CPA describes on which capabilities two parties have agreed to conduct business. This includes technical capabilities such as communication and messaging  protocols  but  also  business  capabilities   i.e.,  which  business processes are shared in the context of a CPA .  Here is a CPA example:  <CollaborationProtocolAgreement id = “…”   xmlns=”http:  www.ebxml.org namespaces tradePartner” xmlns:bpm=”http:  www.ebxml.org namespaces businessProcess” xmlns:ds = “http:  www.w3.org 2000 09 xmldsig” xmlns:xlink = “http:  www.w3.org 1999 xlink”>       …     …          …     …   <ConversationConstraints invocationLimit = “…”   10.3 ebXML  383  concurrentConversations = “…” >    …     …     …     …       Because a CPA is constructed from an intersection of the CPPs of the two parties, most elements of a CPA are the same in a CPP. We explain here only the additional elements.    The optional CPAType element contains information about the general nature of the CPA. A Protocol child element identiﬁes the business- level protocol, for example, PIP3A4, a RosettaNet Partner Interface Pro- cess. A Type child element speciﬁes additional information regarding the business protocol. The speciﬁc values depend on the particular pro- tocol. An example is RNIF  RosettaNet Implementation Framework .    The required Status element identiﬁes the state of the process that cre- ates the CPA. Two values are possible in its value attribute: “proposed” when the agreement is still negotiated and “signed” if the agreement is closed.    The required Start and End elements specify the date and time when the CPA takes effect and when the CPA must be renegotiated by the parties  i.e., the lifetime of the CPA .    The  optional  ConversationConstraints element  documents  certain agreements about conversation processing. The invocationLimit attri- bute deﬁnes the maximum number of conversations that can be per- formed under this CPA. The concurrentConversations attribute deﬁnes the maximum number of conversations that can be processed under this CPA simultaneously.    Two required PartyInfo elements, one for each party. These elements describe the terms under which each party has agreed to this CPA. For a  detailed  description  of  the  PartyInfo element,  see  the  earlier  CPP section.    At least one ds:Signature element that provides signing of the CPA us-  ing the XML Digital Signature standard.    Optional Comment elements.  10.3.4 The ebXML Process Model  The ebXML Business Process Speciﬁcation Schema  OASIS 2001b  deﬁnes the  orchestration  of  business  transactions  into  collaborative  business   384  Chapter 10 Infrastructure  Binary collaborations  UML  Web service collaboration  Business process collaboration  processes.  The  speciﬁcation  is  based  on  a  subset  of  prior  UN CEFACT work, namely, the metamodel behind the UN CEFACT Uniﬁed Modeling Methodology   UMM ,  which  is  based  on  UML.  Thus  ebXML  process models can be represented in both XML and UML.  The  current  speciﬁcations  support  only  binary  collaborations—busi- ness  processes  with  more  than  two  participating  partners  are  not  yet covered.  However,  in  most  cases,  multiparty  business  processes  can  be synthesized from several binary business processes.   Typically, an ebXML speciﬁcation schema starts with the deﬁnition of a  UML  speciﬁcation  schema.  The  UML  speciﬁcation  schema  used  in ebXML is a subset of the UMM.  An ebXML schema  DTD  can be generated from the UML speciﬁcation with the help of production rules. This is possible without information loss,  because  the  UML  speciﬁcation  schema  and  the  XML  speciﬁcation schema are isomorphic.  ebXML Web services collaborate with other services via ebXML busi- ness service interfaces. These interfaces execute the business processes as conﬁgured  with  the  speciﬁcation  schema.  They  do  so  by  exchanging ebXML messages and business signals.  Business signals are application- level documents that signal the current state of a business transaction. Business signals, however, do not transport application data; they merely indicate the current state of a process.   An ebXML business process collaboration is constituted from a num-  ber of elements. Let’s take each in turn.  Partners Two or more partners take part in a business process. Each partner plays one or several roles within a business process.  Business Document Flow Document ﬂows carry business documents between participating roles of a business transaction. Each document ﬂow can carry one primary busi- ness document. There is always one requesting document ﬂow, but there can be none, one, or many responding document ﬂows, depending on the type of transaction.  <DocumentFlow     isSuccess=”true” documentType=”Card validation acknowledgment” >   10.3 ebXML  385  <DocumentFlow     isSuccess=”false” documentType=”Card validation rejection” >  This example shows two responding document ﬂows, one when the  transaction was successful, the other when the transaction failed.  Business Transactions A business transaction is an atomic unit of work in a business relationship between two roles, with one role in the position of a service requester, the other  role  in  the  position  of  a  responder.  Because  in  ebXML  business transactions are atomic, they cannot be subdivided. A business transac- tion  either  succeeds  or  fails.  If  it  succeeds,  its  outcome  may  be  legally binding for both partners; if it fails, it must be treated as if it has never happened  rollback . Each business transaction contains one requesting document ﬂow and zero, one, or many responding document ﬂows.  Atomic transactions      <RequestingBusinessActivity  name=”” isNonRepudiationRequired=”true” timeToAcknowledgeReceipt=”P1M” timeToAcknowledgeAcceptance=”P2M”>  <DocumentFlow  isSuccess=”true” documentType=”Credit card slip” >    <RespondingBusinessActivity  name=”” isNonRepudiationRequired=”true” timeToAcknowledgeReceipt=”P4M”>  isSuccess=”true” documentType=”Card validation acknowledgment” >  <DocumentFlow    <DocumentFlow  isSuccess=”false” documentType=”Card validation rejection” >            386  Chapter 10 Infrastructure  In this business transaction two documents are exchanged: the request message contains a business card slip that needs to be validated. The re- spective  response  document  contains  the  positive  or  negative  answer. There are three additional business signals: the ﬁrst acknowledges that the request has been received; the second acknowledges that the request has been accepted for processing; and the third is given by the requesting party to acknowledge that the response document has been received. The time  periods  speciﬁed  are  given  in  the  format  used  in  XML  Schema  “P4M” means “period of 4 minutes”  and are counted from the initial re- quest on.  Collaborations Two or more roles collaborate in a business process. Collaborations be- tween more than two roles are always synthesized from binary collabora- tions   i.e.,  with  two  participating  roles .  A  binary  collaboration  can  be seen as a protocol between two roles.  Each collaboration consists of a set of business activities. A business activity might be atomic  a business transaction , or it may be complex  another binary collaboration . This allows the deﬁnition of nested and multiparty collaborations.  <BinaryCollaboration  name=”Credit Card Validation” timeToPerform=”P5M”>      <BusinessTransactionActivity  name=”Card validation activity” businessTransaction=”Card validation” fromAuthorizedRole=”merchant” toAuthorizedRole=”card-service” >     Business activities  Multiparty collaboration  This example shows a simple binary collaboration constituted from the  business  transaction  deﬁned  earlier.  The  following  example  shows a multiparty  collaboration  for  a  typical  credit  card  purchase  over  the Internet:         <Performs  binaryCollaboration=”e-Order”   10.3 ebXML  387  authorizedRole=”buyer” >       <Performs  <Performs  binaryCollaboration=”e-Order” authorizedRole=”seller” >  binaryCollaboration=”Credit Card Validation” authorizedRole=”merchant” >       <Performs  binaryCollaboration=”Credit Card Validation” authorizedRole=”card-service” >       This collaboration takes place between three parties  customer, retailer, and  card  agency   and  involves  two  binary  collaborations   e-order  and credit card validation from the previous example .  Choreography The ebXML business transaction choreography describes how the busi- ness activities  collaboration activities and business transaction activities  within a collaboration are ordered and sequenced. When using UML, this can be speciﬁed using a UML activity diagram.   The business activities deﬁne the business states within a choreogra- phy. In addition, there are auxiliary states such as Start state, Terminal state  which comes in a Success or Failure ﬂavor , Fork state, and Join state. Fork splits a sequence of business activities into several concurrent sequences, while Join reunites several concurrent sequences.  The choreography deﬁnes the transitions between the business states. Each transition can be gated by guards—criteria such as the status of the document ﬂow that caused the transition, the type of document sent, the content of the document, or postconditions on the prior state.  Transitions are deﬁned as child elements of a BinaryCollaboration ele- ment, or in the case of a MultiPartyCollaboration as child elements of BusinessPartnerRole elements.    ...  Business states  Transitions   388  Chapter 10 Infrastructure  Catalog  <Transition  fromBinaryCollaboration=”e-Order” fromBusinessState=”Accept Order” toBinaryCollaboration=”Credit Card Validation” toBusinessState=”Accept Order” >     Y  This is a simple transition deﬁnition for the MultiPartyCollaboration example shown earlier, arranging the sequential execution of both binary collaborations deﬁned for the role “Retailer”. There is only a single busi- ness state  Accept Order .  F L  M  Patterns The  ebXML  speciﬁcation  schema  provides  a  set  of  predeﬁned  patterns that can be used to construct transactions and collaborations. This reuse mechanism leads to faster and more standardized work products.   E  The  ebXML  Catalog  of  Common  Business  Processes   OASIS  2001c  speciﬁes an initial list of various common business process names. This includes business processes deﬁned by other common industry standards such as RosettaNet, X12, EDIFACT, JiPDEC CII, OAG BOD, or xCBL. It is planned to create ebXML collaboration patterns on the basis of each of these business processes. These patterns can be stored in public or shared ebXML repositories. ebXML design tools will link into these repositories, support the discovery of predeﬁned collaboration patterns, and help in the construction of customized business processes.  T  A  10.3.5 How Context Is Handled  Imagine  the  following  situation:  A  printing  house  based  in  the  United States wants to order spare parts for their printing press from a manufac- turer based in Germany. Both partners in this transaction operate in dif- ferent contexts. First, they are in different locations, one in the United States, one in Germany. Second, they belong to different industries, one to  the  printing  industry,  the  other  to  the  manufacturing  industry.  It  is very  likely  that  the  formats  of  business  documents   such  as  purchase orders or invoices  used by these partners are different. For example, the address element of such a business document would show differences: in the United States, the address contains a “state” element; in Germany it does not. The ZIP in a U.S. address is positioned after the state element; the German “Postleitzahl” is positioned before the town element.  Team-Fly®   10.3 ebXML  389  Context categories  Core components  Such differences are usually not a problem when transactions are han- dled by humans. But when a transaction is handled by a computer, it be- comes a problem. Let’s see how ebXML solves that problem.  First, ebXML subdivides contexts into context categories. In particular, for the purpose of doing business over the Internet, it identiﬁes the fol- lowing context categories  or context drivers :     Region: The geopolitical region, such as country or state.    Industry: The industry domain to which a partner belongs.   Process: The current business process. Different business processes may  require speciﬁc formats in business documents.    Product: Product categories may also inﬂuence the format of business  documents.    Legislative: The legislative context used for this document.   Role: The current role of a partner. In our previous example, we had two roles: buyer and seller. Buyer and seller operated in different re- gional and industry contexts.    And so on.  The value of each context category is a simple string, for instance, “US” or “Germany” for the region. It is possible to constrain the possible values for context categories by deﬁning a reference to an established taxonomy such as ISO3166 for regional contexts.  Second,  ebXML  does  not  deﬁne  specialized  business  documents  for each purpose and each context. This would make it practically impossible for partners to agree on a document format. Instead, ebXML deﬁnes a set of generic core components. Business documents are assembled from these core  components  with  the  help  of  assembly  rules  and  are  further  cus- tomized with the help of context rules. This sounds difﬁcult, but it solves a problem that lingered in the EDI world for about 25 years: the inability of business partners to refer to a common business terminology. This is no easy task: different industries use different names for the same con- cepts,  and  the  same  concepts  can  look  very  different  in  different  con- texts. OASIS  2001d  deﬁnes how business documents are composed from a library of core components.  The initial catalogue of core components lists nearly 100 core compo- nents, including postal address, street building identiﬁer, post ofﬁce box identiﬁer, party type, language, language usage, date, time, birth date and time, organization incorporation date and time, account identiﬁer, and many more.   390  Chapter 10 Infrastructure  Domain components  Document assembly  Core  components  are  complemented  by  user-deﬁned  domain  com- ponents. Domain components should be speciﬁed in the same detail as core  components,  complete  with  the  relevant  contexts.  Domain  com- ponents and additional context categories should be registered with an ebXML repository, too, to allow reuse of these components and context categories.  Assembly rules compose a document schema from core components.  This is done with the following operations:    CreateGroup creates  a  model  group  consisting  of  several  elements  or  other model groups.    CreateElement creates a new simple type or complex type element.   UseElement imports a core component.   Rename can change the name  and even the path  of previously com-    Condition can specify context criteria under which the above opera-  posed elements.  tions are executed.  Here is an example of document assembly:                <CreateElement  type=”PartyType” location=”GUID” id=”Buyer”>   Buyer                                         10.3 ebXML  391                              <CreateElement   Seller        <CreateElement   Item            type=”PartyType” id=”Seller” location=”GUID”>  minOccurs=”1” maxOccurs=”unbounded” type=”ItemType” location=”GUID” id=”Item”>  Context  rules  can  further  modify  a  document.  Each  rule  speciﬁes  a matching algorithm. Rules can match exactly; that is, the speciﬁed value in the Condition element must match the value of the context category exactly.   Alternatively, rules can match hierarchically, according to the deﬁni- tions given in the referenced taxonomy. For example, the regional con- text would have a taxonomy that is structured according to the following hierarchy:    Global    Continent   Economic region   Country  ISO 3166.1    Region  ISO 3166.2   If, for example, we would specify “North America” as regional context in a Condition,  it  would  match  concrete  context  values  such  as  “United States”, “Canada”, “Mississippi”, “Ontario”, and so on, because these val- ues are members of the “North America” hierarchy.   392  Chapter 10 Infrastructure  Actions  If  the  test  speciﬁed  in  Condition succeeds,  several  actions  can  be  performed:    Add: This action includes new elements in a document.   Occurs: This  action  speciﬁes  the  number  of  occurrences  in  terms of minOccurs and maxOccurs.  If  nothing  is  speciﬁed,  minOccurs and maxOccurs default to 1  i.e., a single required element .    Subtract: This action removes elements from a document.   Condition: Apply another condition. Conditions can be nested.   Comment: A comment block.   Rename: Elements can be renamed  see above .  However, there is one problem: Context rules may conﬂict. For exam- ple, a context rule for the context “Region” could conﬂict with a context rule for the context “Industry”. These conﬂicts must be resolved:    Context rules are executed in the order they are speciﬁed in the con-  text rule document.     Context rules may be equipped with an explicit order attribute that  can be used to force a given order on a set of rules.   Here is an example of context rules:            <Taxonomy context=”Region”  ref=”http:  ebxml.org classification ISO3166” >                                          10.4 Industry Vocabularies  393  Pivot format           Third, ebXML deﬁnes a semantic interoperability document format, that is, a syntax-neutral format for the exchange of documents between part- ners  who  use  different  formats  for  business  documents.  An  ebXML processor would translate a business document into the syntax-neutral format before transmitting it to the receiver. At the receiver side the doc- ument is translated from the syntax-neutral format into the speciﬁc syn- tax used by the receiver. Using such a “pivot” format reduces the number of required conversion procedures. UUIDs and globally unique URIs are used to identify document elements in a syntax-neutral way.  10.3.6 Future  The ebXML speciﬁcations were released in May 2001. At the same time, UN CEFACT  and  OASIS  demonstrated  the  ﬁrst  “proof  of  concept”  ap- plications. By mid-2001 the very ﬁrst tools for ebXML appeared on the market  see Chapter 11 . However, it will still be a while before the ﬁrst all-in-one shrink-wrapped packages are available and the ﬁrst ebXML re- positories are in operation. Work continues in the OASIS Universal Busi- ness Language  UBL  Technical Committee to develop a standard XML business library.  Also, we should not expect a fully automated negotiation process be- tween  business  partners  with  the  ﬁrst  products.  The  ﬁrst  products  will support manual or semiautomatic negotiation.  10.4 INDUSTRY VOCABULARIES  In this section we give a short overview of some relevant horizontal and vertical XML-based industry vocabularies.

Solutions  11  11.1 Design Tools  11.2 Database Systems  11.3 Middleware  11.4 Application Servers  11.5 Authoring  11.6 Content  Management  In this chapter we discuss selected XML technologies from  the areas of design, data storage, middleware, authoring,  and  content  management  where  practical  solutions  are  al-  ready in place.  In  Section  11.1,  we  present  tools  that  support  XML  authors  and  architects  in  the  design  process.  This  includes  tools for conceptual design such as UML tools, and also tools  for the design of workﬂows such as Microsoft’s BizTalk or the  various  RosettaNet-related  design  tools.  Designing  XML  schemata has become easier as good visual editors for DTDs  and XML Schema such as Tibco’s XML Authority and Altova’s  XML Spy have gone on the market.  In Section 11.2, we browse the market for XML-enabled  database management systems. We ﬁrst discuss the require-  ments for such systems, and then we investigate some of the  397   398  Chapter 11 Solutions  DBMSs, such as Oracle and IBM’s DB2, that provide XML support via an addi- tional XML layer  mapped systems . Then we take a close look at native XML database  management  systems  such  as  Software  AG’s  Tamino.  Finally,  we recommend best practices on how to select an appropriate database man- agement system.  In Section 11.3, we go into the details of three sample Web-enabled mid- dleware  systems:  Hewlett-Packard’s  e-speak,  RosettaNet,  and  Microsoft’s BizTalk. Especially BizTalk is of interest here, as it is the ﬁrst major application relying on the SOAP communications protocol.  F L  In Section 11.4, we brieﬂy list XML-enabled application servers. Basically all manufacturers of application servers provide support for XML and Web ser- vices related standards such as SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI.  In Section 11.5, we discuss tools for the authoring of presentation objects. This includes tools for the authoring of HTML, WML, SVG, SMIL, and Voice- XML, but also tools for the deﬁnition of transformation scripts such as XSLT scripts.  M  Finally, in Section 11.6, we brieﬂy discuss the architecture of content man- agement systems as an example of an architecture integrating various tech- niques presented throughout this book.  E  A  Y  T  11.1 DESIGN TOOLS  Although sometimes paper and pencil are the best design tools, there are cases where the help of computer-based tools is appreciated. In this sec- tion, we discuss tools for conceptual design, process design, and schema design.  11.1.1 Conceptual Design  Good design tools for XML-centric conceptual design are still as rare as hen’s teeth. Among general design methods and design tools, UML is the obvious choice, since UML has been proposed to become an ISO standard and other electronic business standards such as ebXML or UDDI rely on the UML design method.  Commercial  systems  such  as  Rational  Rose   www.rational.com   and TogetherSoft   www.togethersoft.com   also  support  the  design  of  XML schemata. This integration covers only the possibility of modeling XML implementation structures within UML. You can, for example, model a particular document class in terms of speciﬁc UML stereotypes  see Sec-  Team-Fly®  UML tools   11.1 Design Tools  399  tion 3.4.1  and then export these deﬁnitions as a DTD or schema. You can also import DTDs and schemata. However, UML and XML Schema have only a common subset of features. Advanced XML Schema features require proprietary extensions to the UML model that can make round- trip engineering difﬁcult.  Directly generating XML from a conceptual model deﬁned in UML is still an open problem. Starting with a conceptual model such as an entity relationship model and then arriving by automatic means at some XML Schema deﬁnitions is not covered by these systems. The user is required either to write explicit production rules  to generate XML schemata as code  or to export the deﬁnitions into the XMI format  see Section 3.4.1  and then transform this XMI serialization into an XML Schema deﬁni- tion with the help of XSLT style sheets, or into DTDs with software such as the XMI toolkit from IBM’s alphaworks. If you want to play around a bit with UML and XMI, ArgoUML and Poseidon for UML are nice  and free  UML tools that can generate XMI. They can even export the graph- ics into SVG format. A design tool for AOM  see Section 3.2.2  is available at www.aomodeling.org.  11.1.2 Process Design Processes can be deﬁned with UML in the form of activity diagrams as well.  Once  again,  to  translate  these  diagrams  into  an  XML  process  de- scription language such as BPML or Microsoft’s XLANG, you must trans- form the XMI output with the help of an XSLT style sheet.  Modeling processes for electronic business is usually not an isolated ac- tivity, so the modeling tools are usually integrated into the middleware product that supports a speciﬁc electronic business standard.  BizTalk, for example  see Section 11.3.3 , uses a graphical design pro- cess based on Visio2000. A few VBA plug-ins then serialize the visual de- sign into XLANG deﬁnitions.  For  architectures  such  as  RosettaNet  or  ebXML,  design  tools  are  re- quired  that  are  repository  aware.  Such  design  tools  must  allow  you  to browse  directories,  to  discover  existing  partner  proﬁles  and  building blocks for processes, to import and customize these building blocks, and to publish new building blocks within the repository.  BizTalk  At www.rosettanet.org you will ﬁnd an impressive list of solution pro-  RosettaNet  viders who offer appropriate tools to support that standard.   Since the ebXML speciﬁcations were only released in May 2001, the list of available tools is—at the time of writing—not very long. But the ink on the release documents was still wet when the ﬁrst integrated solu- tions supporting ebXML appeared.  ebXML   400  Chapter 11 Solutions  Sun  Microsystems  has  released  the  Java  API  for  XML  Registries  1.0   JAXR .  JAXR  provides  an  API  for  a  set  of  distributed  Registry  Services  that  en- ables business-to-business  integration  between  business  enterprises,  using the protocols  being  deﬁned  by  ebXML.org,  Oasis,  ISO  11179   java.sun.com  aboutJava communityprocess jsr jsr_093_jaxr.html .  An  open  source  development  is  on  the  way  at  openebxml.sourceforge .net . This includes the deﬁnition of a binary markup language, an  op- tional  replacement for XML in the context of ebXML allowing a more compact  message  format  and  supporting  binary  attachments;  a  GUI workbench for editing process deﬁnitions; a business process server; an open  implementation  of  an  ebXML  registry;  and  a  high-performance message handler for ebXML messages.  Data Access Technologies  DAT   www.enterprise-component.com  has re-  leased a “ﬁrst-look” beta release of their Component-X for ebXML:  Component-X provides visual and intuitive drag-and-drop assembly and con- ﬁguration of Enterprise Business Components and Web Services. . . . Compo- nent-X provides a visual environment. . . . Components are “wired” together in the visual environment and conﬁgured for the local requirements.  BindSystems  www.bindsys.com  has released an early version of their  BindPartner platform, which  . . . provides a process-oriented approach to business collaboration. . . . These process  models  comply  with  the  ebXML  Business  Process  Speciﬁcation Schema  or BPSS . . . . The process model can be imported as an ebXML com- pliant XML process schema document from an external location and possibly changed, or it can be created in the designer.  11.1.3 Schema Design  For XML schema, the use of visual design tools is highly recommended because  they  considerably  shorten  the  learning  curve  for  this  complex standard.  There are quite a few editors to deﬁne XML schemata and DTDs:    XML authority  www.tibco.com    XML Spy  www.altova.com    Envision XML  www.popkin.com    A number of free XML Schema validators available from Apache, IBM,  Oracle, the University of Edinburgh, and topologi  see below    11.2 Database Systems  401  The  XML  Schema  section  of  the  W3C  Web  site   www.w3.org   contains pointers to several XML Schema–related tools.  A Windows-based validator for Schematron  see Section 2.9.1  is avail- able  from  www.topologi.com.  The  validator  comes  with  popular  XML schemata and Schematron scripts for languages such as RSS, RDF, SOAP, SMIL,  WSDL,  QAML,  XTM,  XLink,  WAI,  XHTML,  RDDL  XHTML,  and CALS, but it also allows user-deﬁned schemata  DTD and XML Schema  and Schematron scripts. In addition to producing validation reports, it can also harvest RDF descriptions and topic maps  XTM  from documents; in fact, it can be used as a front end for performing any XSLT translations.  Schema validation  General requirements  11.2 DATABASE SYSTEMS  The simplest way to store an XML ﬁle is in a native ﬁle system. This ap- proach is, however, only feasible when the performance requirements are moderate, when the number of stored documents is small, when there are  no  stringent  requirements  for  the  integrity  and  safety  of  data,  and when it can be excluded that several users want to update the same docu- ments at the same time.  Database systems provide features that meet these requirements:    Caching reduces the number of disk accesses and thus increases the  performance.    Indexing allows for fast searches against a large document base, instead  of scanning documents in a linear fashion.    A transaction concept makes sure that either all or none of the data in-  volved in a logical transaction is written to the database.    Backup and recovery procedures, logging, and auditing allow for high  safety and traceability of the data.    Locking mechanisms support the simultaneous updates from multiple  users.    In  addition,  modern  database  systems  scale  better.  They  support multiple hardware platforms and operating systems and multiproces- sor architectures and allow several servers to cooperate in a distributed database.  In short, for enterprise solutions there is no other option than to store XML documents in a database management system. The problem, how- ever, is that the current de facto standard, relational technology, is any- thing but adequate for storing and retrieving XML documents. SQL, for example, does not provide the means to drill down to a particular child element in a deeply nested hierarchical document. The relational world is   402  Chapter 11 Solutions  XML requirements  Integrity  ﬂat, but XML is not.  This restriction has been mellowed with the deﬁni- tion of SQL:1999, which allows queries on object aggregations. However, the SQL:1999 object model differs from the XML information model.   Let’s  brieﬂy  discuss  the  requirements  for  an  XML-enabled  database management system. Apart from the usual database features like perfor- mance,  support  for  large  document  bases,  transaction  concept,  data safety, concurrency control, and scalability, XML-enabled database man- agement systems should provide    a query language suitable for XML, such as XPath or XQuery   a DOM API, allowing applications to navigate within documents and  update parts of them    the ability to check for the validity of documents against a supplied  schema deﬁnition  DTD or XML Schema     the ability to store XML documents that do not have a schema deﬁni-  tion  required behavior for all XML processors   They could also provide, as additional features,    the ability to update document parts   the ability to access legacy data  i.e., relational data    the ability to store non-XML data  arbitrary text ﬁles and binary ﬁles  such as images, audio clips, or executables     an  integrated  XSLT  processor  that  allows  document  transformations  when storing or retrieving documents    communication methods, for instance, HTTP for the Web or COM+ for  the back end  We did not mention semantic integrity  including referential integrity between documents  because there is currently no standard for deﬁning semantic  integrity  constraints.  In  this  area,  XML  technology  still  falls short of relational technology. Also, we think that, due to the possibly dis- tributed character of XML document sets, the validation of referential in- tegrity constraints is more a task for XML middleware than for a database. There are basically two strategies for implementing an XML database management system  XDBMS . We will discuss these strategies in the fol- lowing two subsections and discuss some commercial implementations, too.  11.2.1 Mapped Systems  One solution is to equip an existing DBMS such as a relational database management  system  with  an  XML  layer  that  converts  incoming  docu-   11.2 Database Systems  403  BLOBs  Breaking documents apart  ments into the datatypes of the host DBMS, and converts outgoing docu- ments  back  into  the  XML  format.  In  addition,  XML  query  expressions must be translated into the query language of the host system.  There are two ways to map an XML document onto a relational data structure. The ﬁrst is the brute-force approach: store the whole document in a BLOB  binary large object . The second is to break the document into single elements and to construct a relational table for each nonterminal element. Both methods have their advantages and drawbacks:    Reading and writing an XML document from and to a BLOB is rela- tively fast as long as documents are of a moderate size. However, up- dating  document  parts  in  large  documents  can  cause  severe  perfor- mance penalties, since it requires physically rewriting the whole BLOB. Another problem with BLOBs is qualiﬁed searches. A search may re- quire  parsing  the  stored  documents,  which  is  especially  slow  when documents are large. Most systems offer text retrieval facilities  i.e., in- dexing of all relevant words within the document  to avoid the costly scanning of the document base.    Breaking  documents  apart  into  single  elements  and  storing  them  in different relational tables improves the indexing capabilities. However, because documents must be reconstructed  via relational joins  when they  are  retrieved,  retrieval  operations  can  be  slow.  This  approach works well for documents with a simple structure, but it can be slow for documents with a complex structure. Apart from the performance issues, the main disadvantage of this approach is that schema exten- sions require a redesign of the relational tables. It is not possible to use this approach to store XML documents that come without a schema deﬁnition.  Oracle Oracle  8i   www.oracle.com   supports  both  ways  of  storing  an  XML document:    The document is broken down into an object tree and stored in rela- tional tables. Mapping deﬁnitions deﬁne how this tree is mapped onto the relational tables. On retrieval the XML document is reassembled by applying the mapping inversely.   Oracle 8i allows applications to retrieve the data in object form, too, and can thus avoid the reassembly process in many cases. Since Oracle 8i supports the SQL:1999 object view, it can maintain the hierarchical structure of the document in the object representation.   404  Chapter 11 Solutions  SQL Stored Procedures    The document is stored in a BLOB that can be searched using the Ora- cle  Intermedia  XML  Search.  The  Oracle  Intermedia  XML  Search  is based  on  text  retrieval  technology  and  can  analyze  incoming  docu- ments  and  index  the  relevant  words.  This  allows  for  efﬁcient  docu- ment searches based on the proximity of words, but it does not really recognize the element structure of an XML document.  Oracle 9i introduces a new datatype  XML Type  allowing the storage of an XML document within a column of a relational table. This datatype is basically a BLOB but “provides XPATH navigation capabilities.”  IBM DB2 XML Extender IBM’s DB2 XML Extender  www.ibm.com  equips IBM’s well-known DB2 database system with an XML layer. This layer translates XML documents into  relational  structures  and  vice  versa.  XML  DTDs  are  mapped  onto relational schemata using the proprietary Data Access Deﬁnition  DAD  language. A visual tool is supplied to deﬁne these mappings.  DTDs and DAD documents are stored in their own relational tables in the database, too. Applications invoke the XML Extender via SQL Stored Procedures.  The XML Extender is complemented by the DB2 Text Extender, allow- ing  text  retrieval  searches  on  larger  text  blocks—for  example,  when  a whole XML document is stored in a single column  i.e., a BLOB .  Birdstep Birdstep  www.birdstep.com  is the new kid on the block in terms of data- base technology. Their database engine features a novel design that goes even beyond the relational approach in atomizing complex data struc- tures. Birdstep considers the content  and also the name  of each elemen- tary data ﬁeld as an atom. Each atom is only stored once in the whole database  schema.  Data  structures  are  represented  as  pointers  to  these atoms  and to other data structures . If, for example, a database contains a manufacturer record containing the manufacturer name “Tulloch” and also contains a record describing a whiskey labeled “Tulloch,” then both records point to the same physical storage location where the atom “Tul- loch”  is  stored.  This  allows  very  small  database  sizes,  since  there  is absolutely no redundancy within the database. Also, the database system itself  is  very  small,  and  consequently  Birdstep  targets  the  market  for mobile and embedded devices.  Because data structures are formed as a separate layer on top of the data atoms, the Birdstep database is able to allow hierarchical, relational, and object-oriented views on the same set of data. In particular, a layer   11.2 Database Systems  405  for XML is available for the database that predeﬁnes the necessary access structures for storing and retrieving XML documents. This layer includes implementations  of  SAX,  DOM,  and  XPath   which  is  used  as  a  query language .  eXcelon eXcelon’s Portal Server features a Dynamic XML Engine  DXE  that ac- cepts  XML  documents,  breaks  them  apart  into  individual  objects,  and stores  them  in  object  form.  The  technology  is  probably  based  on eXcelon’s  ObjectStore,  an  object-oriented  DBMS.  The  advantage  when compared with a relational solution is that object-oriented databases dis- play more ﬂexibility when it comes to object aggregations. The DXE is ﬂexible enough to allow for on-the-ﬂy schema extensions. In addition to XML  documents,  the  DXE  can  also  store  non-XML  objects,  including binary data such as images and executables.  The DXE has a DOM API  Level 1 and Level 2 Core , uses XPath for queries,  and  has  a  built-in  XSLT  processor  for  document  transforma- tions. Both index-based searching and text-retrieval-based searching are supported.  Dynamic XML Engine  Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Mighty Microsoft  www.microsoft.com  has also equipped its SQL Server product with an XML layer. In particular, SQL Server 2000 has an XML Rowset provider, which takes an XML document and returns the data in a relational fashion. Results are generated with the help of XQuery.  XML Rowset provider  Ozone Ozone  www.ozone-db.org  is an open-source, object-oriented database sys- tem written in Java. In regard to XML, it acts as a persistent DOM imple- mentation. An XML ﬁle is stored in the DOM format, that is, in the form of Java objects.  Persistent DOM  11.2.2 Native Systems In  native  systems  the  core  of  the  database  system  relies  on  the  XML information model. Usually an incoming document is parsed, and the structural information is stored with the document content in order to allow efﬁcient queries. These systems usually support some sort of XML query language and a DOM API. Examples of native XML database sys- tems are Software AG’s Tamino, Ipedo’s XML Database  www.ipedo.com , IXIASOFT’s  TEXTML  Server   www.ixiasoft.com ,  NeoCore’s  XMS   www .neocore.com , and the Open Source Development’s dbXML  www.dbxml   406  Chapter 11 Solutions  Access  Queries  Schema support  .org  and eXist  exist.sourceforge.net . We will restrict our discussion to Ta- mino, which has the largest market share.  Tamino Software AG  www.softwareag.com  has a long tradition as a maker of data- base systems. Their Adabas DBMS introduced table-based data structures long  before  relational  technology  became  a  topic.  Adabas  had  always allowed a limited nesting of data structures within table ﬁelds, and con- sequently  Adabas  aﬁcionados  had  always  viewed  relational  technology with some suspicion when it came to performance. It was not a surprise that Software AG became active when XML—with its hierarchical data structures—appeared on the horizon. The result was Tamino, a database system that stores XML documents natively without conversion.  Tamino  supports  a  SAX  and  a  DOM2  API.  It  also  can  hook  up  with popular Web servers, so that it is possible to store and retrieve documents through an HTTP client. There is also a WebDAV access layer allowing WebDAV-enabled  applications   such  as  Microsoft  Ofﬁce  products   to transparently access XML documents stored in Tamino. Incoming docu- ments are analyzed and are indexed according to the deﬁnitions in the corresponding schema deﬁnition. Document schemata are deﬁned with a subset of XML Schema, but Tamino is also able to store documents that do not have a schema deﬁnition, including non-XML documents such as word documents, images, or binaries.  Currently, subsets of XPath and XQuery are supported as query lan- guages.  It  is  possible  to  combine  text  retrieval  and  tag-related  queries  based on indices  into a single query expression.   DTDs and a subset of XML Schema are supported for schema deﬁni- tion. Tamino uses the appinfo section of XML Schema to store additional metainformation about the physical layout of the data. This includes in- formation about indexing, but also information about mapping to other resource  managers.  Thus,  documents  that  are  written  to  and  retrieved from Tamino are not necessarily stored in Tamino but can be stored in a remote relational database, a ﬁle system, a message service, and so on. This allows companies to leave existing enterprise data at the point of ori- gin but still be able to integrate this data into XML scenarios.  11.2.3 Best Practices We recommend the following practices:    Select technology that stays close to the standards. Extensions are al- ways nice to have, but they also lock you into a proprietary platform.   11.3 Middleware  407  XML database technology is still young, so you will ﬁnd that imple- mentations differ vastly. The XML standard does deﬁne the document layout, but it does not deﬁne an interface and protocol for database access.    Select technology that can scale well. What runs today on a PC or a  Unix box may require a mainframe tomorrow.    Do not use “exotic” XML features. In terms of databases, XML enti- ties—and  in  particular  external  entities—are  exotic  features  and  are not supported by most database systems. Other database systems may support entities but “ﬂatten” the document  i.e., resolving the entities  when it is stored. When you retrieve the document, it will deﬁnitely look different than when you stored it!    A good test for portability is the “schema test”: Can you take the DTDs or  schemata  of  your  XML  application,  load  them  into  the  database, and run the application without further work? Or is it necessary to set up SQL create commands, that is, repetitive work that you might have to do every time the schema changes?    Some DBMSs generate internal object identiﬁers. Do not even consider storing  these  identiﬁers  within  your  data  structures!  It  is  ﬁne  to  use these identiﬁers in your programs and to store them in transient vari- ables, but they should not be stored in persistent data structures. This type  of  identiﬁer  will  almost  certainly  change  when  you  rearrange your data or when you migrate to a different vendor. If you need to identify objects such as documents, create your own identiﬁers, either based on a unique domain name or by computing a UUID.  11.3 MIDDLEWARE  XML middleware is responsible for organizing message transport, orches- trating business processes, and much more. We will discuss a few impor- tant architectures.  11.3.1 e-speak  Hewlett-Packard’s e-speak is the odd man out in this list of XML middle- ware for electronic business. e-speak is not really an XML technology, but it uses proprietary communication and storage formats. The reason why we discuss it here is that e-speak was the ﬁrst fairly complete middleware architecture  for  enabling  electronic  business.  It  was  probably  the  ﬁrst architecture to introduce peer-to-peer communication.    408  Chapter 11 Solutions  Abstract resource layer  Repository  Peer-to-peer  Requirements for resources  A  E  In  the  meantime,  e-speak  has  been  opened  up  to  the  XML  world. Hewlett-Packard has, for example, joined the UDDI bandwagon. e-speak Web services can thus be discovered via UDDI, and e-speak clients will be able to discover non–e-speak Web services.  e-speak has been designed with the goal of making enterprise legacy IT infrastructures available as Web services. It does so by introducing an ab- stract layer of resources. A resource represents active and passive elements within the e-speak infrastructure, such as a service, a ﬁle, or a hardware device. All e-speak functionality is based on this abstract layer. The un- derlying  physical  entities  are  not  accessed  by  e-speak  directly.  Instead, resource-speciﬁc handlers provide this access  Hewlett-Packard 2001 :   Every  access  to  a  resource  through  e-speak  involves  two  different  sets  of manipulations:   The e-speak platform uses its resource descriptions to dynamically discover the most appropriate resource, transparent access to remote resources, and sending events to management tools.    The resource-speciﬁc handler directly accesses the resource such as reading  M  F L  Y  the disk blocks for a ﬁle.  This technique allows e-speak to access existing and new infrastructures, while keeping the logical-level device and technology neutral. In particu- lar, e-speak allows interoperation with component models such as Enter- prise Java Beans, CORBA, and COM+.  T  Each e-speak platform constitutes a logical machine. Each logical ma- chine has a repository that stores the resource descriptions. Service pro- viders can register a service  i.e., store the resource metadata of the service  in such a repository. Clients in turn can look up a service in the repository and bind to it. Clients may then invoke an entry point on a service.  This looks very much like an enterprise architecture. But what is differ- ent here is that multiple distributed e-speak machines can interoperate over the Internet. When, for example, a client issues a search for a speciﬁc service, he or she will ask the look-up service of the local e-speak machine. This machine will look in its local repository, but it will also propagate the request to other e-speak machines known to it. When an appropriate ser- vice description is found, the client is informed about its location and can then communicate with the foreign machine on a peer-to-peer basis.  This ability to interoperate with other machines requires some extra  consideration when describing resources:    Resources must be identiﬁed with a globally unique ID  URL .   Resources must publish a public key, thus allowing secured communi-  cation with them.    Resources must deﬁne a vocabulary.  Team-Fly®   11.3 Middleware  409  Vocabularies  Mailbox model  Event service  In addition, resources possess all properties that are required in an enter- prise environment as well, such as access control lists, descriptions, and so on. Descriptions consist of a set of attributes, each attribute consisting of a name value pair. When a service provider registers a service, it pro- vides an attribute-based description of the service. The attributes are later used to look up the service.   All  attributes  follow  an  agreed-upon  vocabulary.  Vocabularies  deﬁne the  name  and  type  of  attributes.  They  are  implemented  as  ﬁrst-class  e-speak core services, thus enabling the registration of custom vocabular- ies and the discovery of vocabularies.  e-speak’s  communication  model  follows  a  simple  mailbox  model.  A client that wishes to send a message to a resource constructs a message consisting of a message header and payload and places the message into the client’s outbox. The e-speak core reads the message header and for- wards  the  message  to  the  inbox  of  the  receiver.  The  receiver’s  resource handler may then read the header information and the payload. e-speak supports pluggable transport protocols including TCP IP, IrDA, WAP, and HTTP.  Currently,  there  is  no  direct  support  for  SOAP   Hewlett-Packard 2001 .  To allow the collaboration of applications the e-speak core implements an event service. Apart from core-generated events, resources can publish events and can subscribe to event distributors. However, e-speak does not directly  support  higher-level  modeling  of  collaborating  business  pro- cesses. In particular, e-speak does not feature a process model.  11.3.2 RosettaNet  RosettaNet  is  named  after  the  Rosetta  Stone.  This  ancient  document contained the same message in three languages and was the key to the modern deciphering of hieroglyphics. RosettaNet aims to break language barriers as well.  RosettaNet is a nonproﬁt consortium of more than 400 leading compa- nies from the areas of information technologies, electronic components, and semiconductor manufacturing, representing more than $1 trillion in revenue. RosettaNet therefore does not address the requirements of the whole electronic business community but of only a certain sector of that community.  However,  because  of  its  nonproprietary  and  international character and its foundation on XML, the inﬂuence of RosettaNet on elec- tronic business as a whole cannot be underrated. RosettaNet is, for exam- ple, supported by Microsoft’s BizTalk Server  see Section 11.3.3 . Rosetta- Net also supports horizontal standards such as ebXML  in particular, the   410  Chapter 11 Solutions  Architecture  ebXML  Messaging  Service  Speciﬁcation  for  the  secure  transfer,  routing, and packaging of electronic information—see Section 10.3  and UDDI  to simplify the registration and discovery of e-business processes across the supply chain—see Section 7.3 .  The  principal  foundation  of  the  RosettaNet  architecture   RosettaNet 2001  consists of dictionaries, implementation frameworks, and partner interface processes.  Dictionaries deﬁne  a  common  vocabulary  for  trading  partners,  thus reducing the confusion due to each company’s own terminology. Rosetta- Net  business  dictionaries  contain  the  vocabulary  for  deﬁning  business transactions between trading partners, while RosettaNet technical dictio- naries provide the vocabulary for deﬁning products and services. Among the business dictionaries we ﬁnd    a dictionary with twelve quantitative fundamental business data entities  ranging from      Height Dimension     Vertical dimension of an object when object in the upright position.     Real   1   15   9 13 V99   to         Width Dimension     Shorter measurement of the two horizontal  dimensions measured with object in the upright  position.

Entities  are  deﬁned with their name and several constraints such as datatype, minimum and maximum  occurrences,  and  a  representation.  The  description  element deﬁnes further semantics in an informal way.  The RosettaNet  implementation  framework  RNIF   speciﬁcation  deﬁnes exchange protocols for the implementation of RosettaNet standards for the information exchange between trading partners. The RNIF covers the areas of transport, routing, and packaging; security; signals; and trading partner agreements.  Partner interface processes  PIPs  are XML-based dialogs that deﬁne the business processes between trading partners. A PIP speciﬁcation consists of a business document  with its vocabulary  and a business process  with the message dialog choreography . PIP speciﬁcations are not yet available in machine-readable format; however, it is expected that this will happen soon,  so  that  the  construction  of  business  actions  and  signal  messages can be automated.  A PIP speciﬁcation comprises the following three views:    Business operational view  BOV : This view describes the semantics of the business data entities  business documents  and how they are ex- changed between the actors  roles  engaged in a business process.     Functional service view  FSV : This view is derived from the BOV and de- scribes the services within the network and the interactions between them that are necessary to execute a partner interface process. The de- scription includes all transaction dialogs  i.e., requests, signals, and re- sponses  within a PIP protocol.     Implementation framework view  IFV : This view describes the network protocol formats and the communication requirements supported by the network services. The IFV allows multiple transport protocols for messages.  Version  2.0  of  RosettaNet  implementation  framework  ex- plicitly  speciﬁes  SMTP  and  HTTP  as  transport  protocols.  S MIME  is used for message envelopes, and this might have been one reason why MIME was added as a message envelope format in version 2.0 of the BizTalk platform.  PIPs are specialized to the following core process areas: administration; partner, product, and service review; product information; order manage- ment; inventory management; marketing information management; ser- vice and support; and manufacturing. These areas are called clusters and are further subdivided into segments  Figure 11.1 .   11.3 Middleware  413  PIP  Clusters  RosettaNet Support  Product Information  Inventory Management  Service and Support Manufacturing  Partner, Product, and Service Review  Order Management  Marketing Information Management  Segments  Transportation and Distribution  Quote and Order Entry    Returns and Finance  Product Configuration  Request Quote  Request Price and Availability   Transfer Shopping Cart  Query Order Status  Notify of Purchase Order Acceptance  Manage Purchase Order  Distribute Order Status  Request Purchase Order Cancellation  Change Purchase Order  Notify of Quote Acknowledgment  :Buyer START  :Seller    > Query Purchase Order Status  [Success]  [Fail]        > Purchase Order Status  Response  END  FAILED   > Purchase Order Status  Query  Process Purchase Order Status Query  <!ELEMENT Pip3A5PurchaseOrderStatusQuery              fromRole ,           GlobalDocumentFunctionCode ,           PurchaseOrderStatusQuery ,           thisDocumentGenerationDateTime ,           thisDocumentIdentifier ,           toRole   >   <!ELEMENT fromRole               PartnerRoleDescription   >   <!ELEMENT PartnerRoleDescription              ContactInformation? ,           GlobalPartnerRoleClassificationCode? ,           PartnerDescription?   > ... ...   <!ELEMENT Pip3A5PurchaseOrderStatusResponse              fromRole ,           GlobalDocumentFunctionCode ,           OrderStatus ,           requestingDocumentDateTime ,           requestingDocumentIdentifier ,           thisDocumentGenerationDateTime ,           thisDocumentIdentifier ,           toRole   >   <!ELEMENT fromRole               PartnerRoleDescription   >   <!ELEMENT PartnerRoleDescription              ContactInformation? ,           GlobalPartnerRoleClassificationCode? ,           PartnerDescription?   >  ... ...

But, in contrast to COM, which remained—in spite of some notable ports to other platforms by third par- ties—more or less a proprietary technology, Microsoft has vowed to keep BizTalk an open platform. Times have changed, and in the days of global business the market would not tolerate a narrow proprietary solution like COM. In fact, Microsoft’s implementations of XML-related standards are very  close  to  the  speciﬁcations.  By  the  time  the  ebXML  speciﬁcation was rolled  out,  Microsoft  was  able  to  present  its  functional  and  well- acclaimed BizTalk server.  But Microsoft’s competitors have also learned from the past. Following the motto “If you can’t beat them, join them,” they have rallied to join the SOAP bandwagon  see Section 6.5.2 . ebXML, for example, included SOAP as a transport method in its speciﬁcations.   The BizTalk Messaging Services BizTalk’s messaging services are an additional logical layer on top of the SOAP message layer. Both layers are implemented by a BizTalk framework 2.0 compliant server  or BFC server  such as—of course—the Microsoft BizTalk  server   see  Figure  11.2 .  The  underlying  transport  layer  can  be HTTP or SMTP. From Microsoft  2000 :  The BizTalk Framework does not prescribe the content or structure  schema  of individual business documents. The details of the business document con- tent and structure, or Schema, are deﬁned and agreed upon by the business entities involved.  The business partners are free to publish their schemata of their busi- ness documents in the BizTalk Schemas Library, or somewhere else. The schema language of choice is XML Schema.  The Message Format For packaging business documents into messages, BizTalk makes use of SOAP header and body elements.   The  SOAP  body  element  can  carry  several  business  documents.  XSL Schema is used to deﬁne the schemata of business documents. Each busi- ness document is a child element of the body element. Because there can also  be  elements  that  are  shared  between  several  business  documents, and these elements must be stored on the root level, too, it is necessary to  BizTalk body element   11.3 Middleware  415  Application  BFC Server  Transport  Application  BFC Server  Transport  Figure 11.2 With the BizTalk compliant server, applications exchange business documents via the underlying transport service.  distinguish  them  from  the  business  document  elements.  This  is  done through the SOAP-ENC:root attribute. This technique of wrapping several business documents and nondocument entities into a single message al- lows us to stay close to the conceptional model of our business case.  Here is an example of the BizTalk body element:     <po:PurchaseOrder    <ship:shippingInfo  ...  ...  xmlns:po=”http:  hardware.org purchase_order ”>     xmlns:ship=”http:  hardware.org shippingInfo ”>       <productList xmlns=”http:  hardware.org productList ”   id=”productList” SOAP-ENC:root=”0”>      416  Chapter 11 Solutions   Nuts  ...        Bolts  ...    ...       This message body contains two business documents: PurchaseOrder and ShippingInfo. Both refer to the same productList element, thus reduc- ing redundancy.  The  productList element  is  also  a  child  element  of  SOAP-ENV:Body but is marked with SOAP-ENC:root=”0” as a nondocument.  Header elements  A BizTalk message contains several SOAP header elements:     The   tag identiﬁes the source and destination of a message.  This tag is required.    The   tag deﬁnes additional properties of the message. It contains child elements specifying the identity of the message, send- ing date, expiration date, and a topic. The identity must be globally unique  for example, a UUID . The   tag is always required.   The   tag allows the speciﬁcation of further options for the processing of the service request. It can ask the receiver to acknowl- edge the reception of the message or to signal the positive commit- ment to process the request. This tag is optional.    The    tag  speciﬁes  a  document  catalogue  that  lists  all  the documents  and  attachments  belonging  to  a  message.  That  may  be business documents contained in the BizTalk messages itself, or non- XML attachments like binary data or images. These attachments may be carried within the same MIME envelope or be external resources. The   tag is optional.    The   tag includes information about the business process that provides the processing context for the BizTalk Document. This infor- mation includes the type of business process, for example, Query Pur- chase Order Status or Request Purchase Order Cancellation. It also includes the  identiﬁcation   URI   of  an  individual  instance  of  that  particular business process type. Further included is implementation-dependent detail information such as a particular step or an entry point within the business process instance. The   tag is also optional.   11.3 Middleware  417  XLANG  Dynamic task mapping  The BizTalk Orchestration Services BizTalk  orchestration   i.e.,  the  planning  and  running  of  business  pro- cesses  is the proprietary part of the BizTalk architecture. The deﬁnition and execution of business processes is based on XLANG, an XML-based language developed by Microsoft. At present, Microsoft seems to have no intention of submitting this language to a standards body.   For the end user, anyway, this language is not visible. A business pro- cess  is  deﬁned  by  visual  means,  using  ﬂowchartlike  graphs.   Actually, Microsoft  uses  its  Visio  product  for  the  visual  interface  and  generates XLANG scripts from the drawings. Currently, there is no way to integrate this design step with UML design tools.  There seems to be no provision to  construct  a  business  process  automatically  by  negotiation  between partners. BizTalk supplies business process designers with a nice visual in- terface—but it still needs a business process designer. This may be a valid approach for the requirements of small businesses  and BizTalk is targeted at smaller businesses , but it is hardly feasible when hundreds or thou- sands of different business processes are involved.  Business processes are deﬁned in terms of abstract tasks that can be ex- ecuted in sequence and or in parallel. At this stage, the designer need not be concerned with a particular implementation.  In  a  second  step  these  abstract  tasks  are  mapped  to  concrete  imple- mentations  called ports in BizTalk , COM+-based business object compo- nents  that  do  the  actual  work.  This  mapping  is  dynamic—it  can  be changed at runtime, depending on the result of a previous task in the process. For example, if a customer makes a selection for a speciﬁc pay- ment or shipment option, the mapping to the appropriate port can be changed on the ﬂy as shown in Figure 11.3.  These ports implement the speciﬁc business logic for each task. Based on COM+ they can access data sources via the BizTalk Messaging services, SQL database access modules, or Web services access modules.  BizTalk orchestration allows modular business processes; that is, it is  possible to construct complex processes from simple ones.   In addition, business processes can be transactional:    BizTalk  supports  short-lived transactions  like  the  classical  ACID  data- base transaction. This includes distributed transactions running under a transaction manager such as the Microsoft Transaction Server.    BizTalk supports long-lived transactions. These transactions do not lock up resources but require programmers to deﬁne compensating actions in case a transaction must be rolled back. This ability to run long-lived   418  Chapter 11 Solutions  BizTalk Orchestration  Dynamic Mapping  Business Logic Components Business Logic Components  Y  F L  M  A  COM+  COM+  E  T  COM+  COM+  Data Access Components  COM+  SQL Data Access  Component  BizTalk Messaging  Service  Web Service Access  Component  SOAP HTML  SQL  EDIFACT, X12,  HTTP, SMPT..., LoL  Web Services  Local Database  Message Queue, Mailbox Figure 11.3 The layered architecture of BizTalk.

Team-Fly®   11.5 Authoring  419  transactions is essential in an electronic business world where transac- tions can span across hours, days, or even weeks.    BizTalk supports nested transactions.  11.4 APPLICATION SERVERS  BizTalk is currently supported by Microsoft’s BizTalk Server. Practically all other application servers from manufacturers such as BEA, Cape Clear, IBM, IONA, Fujitsu, Inprise, SilverStream, Webmethods, and others pro- vide support for Web services with SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI.  Those that won’t will probably not survive.  Some of these application servers have their own workﬂow engines to orchestrate Web services and business pro- cesses, but most manufacturers have opted to support ebXML, too.  11.5 AUTHORING  In  the  previous  sections  we  gave  an  overview  of  tools  that  help the designer  of  software  systems  to  deﬁne  XML  models  and  compo- nents on several architectural layers such as business middleware or data management.  In  this  section  we  will  take  the  perspective  of  the  designer  building XML front-end applications as they are needed in Internet-based envi- ronments. He or she may need or prefer, for example, WYSIWYG editors that abstract from native XML code and allow the rapid composition of user interface applications. Of course, this intersects particularly with Sec- tion 11.1 on design tools because single tool components may be part of larger development environments  e.g., an XML editor in XML Spy . So we will focus on examples that have not been mentioned before.  11.5.1 Creating and Publishing  Text-Based Content  We start our overview by considering “normal” Web publishing on the basis of XML, that is, bringing text-based information to the Internet. In doing so, we give just a limited number of examples. Further examples and additional information can be obtained from the following sites:   www.xmlsoftware.com    wdvl.com Software XML editors.html  WYSIWYG   420  Chapter 11 Solutions  Customization and integration  Creation, workﬂow, and publishing    www2.software.ibm.com developer tools.nsf dw xml-editing-byname   xmlpitstop.com xmlTools.htm  XMetaL XMetaL   www.softquad.com   is  the  follow-up  to  the  HTML  editor  Hot- Metal Pro. It is an XML SGML word-processor-like editing tool that pro- vides  a  source  view  as  well  as  a  tag  view.  It  works  with  SGML  or  XML DTDs,  offers  context-sensitive  lists  of  allowed  elements  and  attributes, and supports CALS tables, DOM, CSS, and HTML. XMetaL has an inte- grated browser preview for XML documents.  The authoring environment can be customized to any DTD without programming. It may be integrated into publishing infrastructures due to its COM architecture Windows scripting features. So the created content ﬁles can be integrated with the Web-based applications to be built.   In addition to the editing views a customizable structure view is pro- vided to navigate documents. External data resources are connected via ODBC using the database import wizard. More advanced features include support for inline table editing  CALS, HTML  and XML constructs, that is, both valid and well-formed XML documents. They also include inter- nal subsets, parsable and scriptable entities, the DOM, OASIS catalogues, and UTF-16  Unicode  encoding.  UltraXML UltraXML   www.webxsystems.com UltraXML.htm   is  a  WYSIWYG  XML solution that allows document creation, workﬂow, and publishing. The necessary  complementary  tool  is  the  WebXSystems  PowerPublisher.  Its features include the following:     Native XML and XSL support   Easy and quick XML text markup and creation methods   Visual XML tree for easy document navigation and XML editing   Visual XML attributes editor   Export XML utilizing the integrated parser to indent and pretty-print  the XML data  UltraXML contains two main components: the integrated Visual DTD  editor and integrated ActiveXSL.  The integrated VisualDTD editor allows the designing of a DTD and visual editing of its attributes and entities. DTDs may be presented as a tree  view  starting  from  any  XML  element.  The  design  of  DTDs  is  sup- ported on the import of XML. Checking and validation mechanisms are   11.5 Authoring  421  provided for XML data. XML is context sensitive, as in XMetaL, based on the  DTD  grammar.  Visual  XML  Schema  support  is  promised  for  future versions.  Integrated ActiveXSL allows the use of XSL code snippets as real-time style  deﬁnitions.  A  document  may  encompass  different  XSL  scripts  for several views on XML data, that is, layouts for different presentation pur- poses such as Web or WAP. On export, XSL text is combined with ﬁlters available for conversion to HTML, CSS2, and XSL:FO. XSL scripts suitable for Internet publishing are created visually. Selective XSL scripts can be created for a style using the hierarchy from a branch of the XML tree. In turn the tool properties can be customized according to an active style to always create the correct XSL code.  Cocoon Cocoon is part of the Apache XML Project  www.apache.org . It is a Java- written framework for XML Web publishing  i.e., Web site creation and management based on the XML paradigm and related technologies .   In Cocoon, the content, style, and logic of Web information are sepa- rately regarded. Thus Cocoon allows the independent design, creation, and management of information on the Web. This is done by holding content, style, and logic in separate XML ﬁles to be merged via XSL trans- formation. Furthermore Cocoon supports client-dependent presentation by transformation or rendering to PDF via XSL:FO or WML.   Web content in Cocoon is developed in three steps:  1. An XML ﬁle is created on the basis of a particular set of tags, nor-  2. The ﬁle is processed employing its logic given in the separated logic  mally given by a DTD.  sheet.  3. The content is rendered for presentation by applying an XSL style sheet.  Cocoon  does  not  provide  its  own  dedicated  text  or  XML- aware editor for content creation.  11.5.2 WML Tools for Mobile Applications  WML, as we saw in Section 8.4, is the XML-based language for deﬁning WAP  applications  for  wireless  devices  such  as  palmtops  and  mobile phones. Although presenting information on such devices is subject to some  limitations,  the  underlying  mechanisms  are  similar  to  rendering into other output formats. Therefore appropriate tools to deﬁne wireless applications would be helpful. We will outline two examples here.   Content, style, and logic   422  Chapter 11 Solutions  WAPPage  DotWap  WAPPage  2.1   www.zyglobe.com products.html   allows  a  developer  to edit,  compile  and  integrate  WML  pages  including  the  conversion  of HTML to WML. Since WAPPage is a visual design tool, the creation and maintenance of ﬁles in WYSIWYG manner does not require any knowl- edge  about  WML  tags.  So  users  work  with  GUI  components  and  drag- and-drop techniques. This type of design includes cards and decks, allow- ing the collection of multiple WMF ﬁles and managing them in a single project ﬁle. Of course you can work on the source code directly. A second type  of  WYSIWYG  editor  using  an  XML  tree  view  supports  navigation through WAP sites. Additionally, WBMP is supported.  Dynamic business applications for WAP-enabled devices can be devel- oped using the WAPobjects framework. Dynamic content is normally cre- ated from databases. This is realized by integrating the framework with Apple’s  WebObjects  IDE.  Applications  are  developed  on  prebuilt  WML components and are based on the WebObjects application server. So ex- isting application logic and database resources built with WebObjects can be reused unmodiﬁed, while WAPobjects enables the user to develop the appropriate user interfaces. External information resources, such as rela- tional databases or enterprise resource planning systems, are included, us- ing WAPobjects’ corresponding object-oriented interface. As with WAP- Page the tools are visual ones.  A freeware tool, DotWap 2.0, is available from Inetis  www.inetis.com  freeware.asp . A collection of further links is given at www.wmlscript.com  devtool devtools.asp?type=Software+Development+Kit+%28SDK%29.  11.5.3 Multimedia  In  Section  8.5,  we  discussed  XML-based  multimedia  formats.  Here  is  a short overview of tools that support SVG, SMIL, and VoiceXML.  SVG When  considering  editing  tools  for  SVG,  the  ﬁrst  approach  is  adding appropriate import export capabilities to existing graphic tools. Examples of such tools are Adobe Illustrator 9.0  www.adobe.com  and CorelDraw 10.0  www.corel.com . This approach is very comfortable because users are normally familiar with the tool of their choice and do not have to learn anything about SVG.  Dealing with native SVG code from scratch is another viable solution. You can use any text editor if you are familiar with the SVG tag set and features, so this is a choice for sophisticated developers rather than for Web designers rapidly creating Web graphics for their applications.   11.5 Authoring  423  An overview of viewers, editors, and converters for SVG can be found at www.w3.org Graphics SVG SVG-Implementations.htm8. A  Java-written open-source toolkit for SVG can be obtained from sis.cmis.csiro.au svg .  SMIL What has been outlined for SVG is basically also true for SMIL. You can either create source code via a traditional editor or ﬁnd an appropriate tool to compose SMIL applications.  RealNetworks  offers  an  additional  product  bundle  for  streaming  ser- vices,  Meta  Creation  Pro   www.realnetworks.com products mediacreation  index.html .  It  includes  the  GRiNS  Editor  Pro  for  RealSystem  G2.  The GRiNS SMIL editor and player started as a public domain tool developed at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands  www.cwi.nl  and has a spin-off at Oratrix. The current version  of  GRiNS  for  SMIL2.0  can  be  obtained  from  www.oratrix.com  Products G2R.  It has now become a SMIL creation tool that allows the developer to orchestrate a presentation of images, text, video, and audio. It also sup- ports merging presentation from fragments by cut copy paste from pre- sentation building blocks. Projects then can be published to a RealSystem Server for playback over the Internet. Alternatively a variety of SMIL play- ers are available elsewhere. For a current development, see a nice Japanese site of DoCoMo  www.docomo-sys.co.jp prod soft smil2.html .  VoiceXML Here the difference from other XML technologies is that the information is not visual. So one element of voice-based application environments is a  text-to-voice  converter.  This  is  comparable  to  the  rendering  step  in visual applications.  An example of development tools for Web-based VoiceXML applica- tions is Tellme Studio  studio.tellme.com . It enables you to build, test, and publish the applications on the Tellme Network. Tellme supports the de- veloper community with several libraries of code and more—newsgroups and newsletters, as well as direct building and testing of applications via the Tellme site if you have registered for a developer ID and PIN.  Several studio resources support development and testing and do not require special software installations. Scratchpad supports editing simple applications that are made available via mouse clicks. You may also de- velop a more complex site, place it on a Web server, and point Studio to that URL. Again you may preview the site via the available phone num- ber and your ID and PIN. Any change leads to syntax checking against   424  Chapter 11 Solutions  the VoiceXML DTD. Studio also provides debugging and trace functional- ity. Instead of testing via phone, the execution of the application can be simulated with the MyStudio Terminal.  VoiceXML  technology  is  also  included,  for  example,  in  the  Voice Server for IBM’s Websphere environment  www-4.ibm.com software speech  enterprise ep_11.html , to mention just one other industry product.  11.5.4 Converters  For the sake of completeness, we do not want to leave unmentioned a class  of  tools  that  allow  converting  several  document  types  into  XML and or exporting XML code into other document types.  These tools may be of interest in some speciﬁc contexts and encom-  pass the following options:    From SGML to XML or vice versa   From XML to HTML, RTF  or vice versa , and plain text   From XML to PDF or PostScript   From publishing formats such as QuarkXPress to XML   From XML to Flash   From relational database content to XML   And many more  We will not discuss these tools in further detail. Instead, an overview of such converters can be found at www.xmlsoftware.com convert .  11.6 CONTENT MANAGEMENT  Content  management  systems   CMSs   integrate  various  technologies such as authoring, database systems, workﬂow control, and format con- version to provide a holistic approach to content production  see Figure 11.4 .  Content  management  systems  support  the  phases  of  text  and media acquisition  often also text and media authoring , editing, trans- formation into a generic format  often XML or SGML , administration of cross references  often with topic maps , postprocessing, customization and personalization, and multitarget publishing to targets such as Web, WAP, SMS, or print. During the publishing process the CMS is responsible for processing, checkin checkout, versioning, rollback to earlier versions, access control, workﬂow control, logging, and more.  In recent years, new content management systems have appeared like mushrooms after a warm rain. The necessary technologies are in place,   11.6 Content Management  425  Text Acquisition  Text Authoring  Media Acquisition  Media Authoring  submit  correct  External Sources  Rule-driven Conversion  Internal Layout  Editing  Mapping  First Release  Second Release  Postprocessing  Customization and Personalization  Multitarget Publishing  Web  WAP  SMS  PDF  Figure 11.4 Workﬂow in a context management system.   426  Chapter 11 Solutions  and a viable market exists, not only in the traditional publishing industry but also in the ﬁeld of corporate publishing. CMSs come in all ﬂavors and price ranges, from open source systems to million- dollar proprietary sys- tems.  Popular  systems  include  Allaire  Spectra,  Arbortext  Epic,  Broad- vision,  Interwoven  TeamSite,  UserLand  Frontier,  and  Vignette  Story- Server. Content management solutions are also found in portal servers such as the server from DataChannel.   Glossary  ACID transaction An acronym for the four primary attributes ensured to any database transaction: atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability  see also Section 6.6.1 . The ACID concept is described in ISO IEC 10026-1:1992, Section 4. Activity A certain task within a process. Activity diagram A method to describe the orchestration of activities in UML. Actors Entities within a given scenario that are proactive; that is, they play a role. Actors can be end users, agents, and other systems. Agent A software agent is an autonomous, somehow intelligent software component that performs tasks to achieve some goals, most likely on behalf of a human user. The term agent is also used in business process manage- ment. In modeling the business domain an agent denotes a human or machine entity performing a process step that adds some value to the overall business process. Agent system The concept or implementa- tion of agents that cooperate to perform tasks and achieve goals. Aggregation A complex entity that has been composed from less complex entities. AOM Asset-oriented modeling  see Section 3.2.2 . API Application Programming Interface. Application server  A Web server that can run applications for clients. Most application  servers can offer application functionality in the form of Web services. Asset In asset-oriented modeling, an abstract notion for any object or relationship between objects that we want to include in a model. Association A relationship that somehow correlates entities with others. Authoring Process of setting up a presenta- tion, for example, on the Web, normally using an appropriate tool set. Browser A user agent that can present HTML or XML pages on a computer screen and that supports navigation over the World Wide Web. Business document  Represents a “real world” document from the business problem domain. Business object Represents a “real world” entity from the business problem domain. Business process  A networklike construct of business entities to describe a complex value creating  or servicing  business activity struc- tured to whatever degree. Business rule  Business knowledge that de- scribes policies and procedures for business transactions or work processes. Commonly based on event-condition-action triples. Byte code A platform-independent and com- pact representation of a compiled computer program. The byte code needs an interpreter  or a runtime system  to execute on a concrete target machine.  427   428  Glossary  A  Canonical form  A preferred syntax for a given content. The canonical form allows the comparison of objects by their string represen- tation: when their string representations are equal, then their content is equal, too. CASE Computer aided software engineering. CASE tools support the design of software sys- tems and can automatically generate certain parts of the implementation. Round-trip en- gineering allows the reﬂection of changes in the implementation back into the conceptual design. Client-server  The relationship between two computer programs where one program—the client—sends a request to the second pro- gram—the server—which in turn answers the client. In distributed computer networks the client-server model is the usual model for dis- tributed applications, potentially including several distributed servers accessed by one or many distributed clients. COM The Component Object Model is Micro- soft’s architecture for the development and deployment of software components. As an extension of OLE, COM is also responsible for services such as interface negotiation, version management, licensing, and event services. DCOM is an extension of COM to distributed environments, where distributed components can communicate via Remote Procedure Calls  RPC . COMMIT The last step in a successful data- base transaction. In distributed database systems, a two-phase commit is necessary. The two-phase commit is a way of handling a transaction in a distributed environment, ensuring that the transaction is performed either on all participating units or on none. Component An independent software module designed for plug & play reuse. Com- ponents contain an interface description, and most components can be conﬁgured according to the requirements of the container appli- cation. Examples of component models are JavaBeans, Enterprise Java Beans, CORBA, ActiveX COM DCOM.  T  E  M  Y  F L  Constraint A Boolean relation between the properties of one or more information items. CORBA The Common Object Request Broker Architecture is the Object Management Group  OMG  component model. CORBA deﬁnes the creation, deployment, and management of distributed components in networks. CORBA requires object request brokers  ORBs  as con- tainer applications. An object request broker enables objects to transparently make and re- ceive requests and responses in a distributed heterogeneous environment. Design pattern  A design technique that names, abstracts, and identiﬁes aspects of a useful design structure for the purpose of reuse. DOM The Document Object Model provides an API to describe, access, create, and modify SGML-based documents, like XML or HTML documents. DTD A Document Type Deﬁnition deﬁnes the valid content of an XML document. ebXML A nonproprietary XML-based stan- dard for conducting business over the Internet. See Section 10.3. EDI The Electronic Data Interchange standard describes the exchange of electronic docu- ments between trading partners. EDI standards are ANSI X12  United States  and EDIFACT  United Nations . Encoding The code system used for a given text. Code systems deﬁne a supported charac- ter set and the mapping of the characters onto a range of integers  character codes . Enterprise Application Integration  EAI  The integration of enterprise resource planning  ERP  systems, existing  legacy  applications, database and data warehouse systems, and front and back ofﬁce into an automated business process. Entity In XML, entities are used for text sub- stitution, for single characters, and also for document parts. In conceptual modeling, an entity is an abstract notion of an object that we want to include in a model.  Team-Fly®   Facet In XML Schema, a speciﬁc constraint narrowing the domain of a datatype. Formatting  Process or result of deﬁning the appearance of information objects, for exam- ple, font type and size, color, and many more. HERM Higher Order Entity Relationship Model. A conceptual modeling method that allows structured attributes and relationships between relationships. HTML Hypertext Markup Language. A hyper- text document format used on the World Wide Web. HTML is an application of SGML. Tags embedded into the text describe certain prop- erties of the text elements and can include other elements such as links to HTML pages or to other resources such as images. HTML is a recommendation of the W3C  World Wide Web Consortium . HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The Inter- net protocol used for communication between clients and servers. HTTP messages consist of requests from client to server and responses from server to client. HTTPS HTTP layered over the SSL protocol. Instance An individual of a certain class or type. Internet  The largest network in the world. The Internet features a three-level hierarchy, consisting of backbone networks, midlevel networks, and stub networks. It spans many different physical networks around the world with various protocols, including the Internet Protocol TCP IP. Layer A set of components with the same degree of application speciﬁcity. Typically a higher layer is the client of a lower layer that serves the higher layer’s requests  e.g., naviga- tion layer, presentation layer . Layout Process or result of  spatial  position- ing of information objects according to an output device. Legacy system A preexisting system that was created using other design methods and technologies.  Glossary  429  Linkbase A separate document that deﬁnes the hyperlinks between a given set of Web resources. See Section 7.1. Locking Mechanism within database man- agement systems  DBMSs  to give a user ex- clusive access to a data object or a group of objects within an ACID transaction. Locking is an important concept to guarantee consis- tent data in multiuser databases. Markup Syntactical means to make text more readable or to add metainformation to a text. In English prose, markup consists of punctuation, parentheses, dashes, footnotes, and so on. In XML, markup consists of tags. Middleware Software systems that provide interoperability services for applications, such as distributed object computing, and conceal some aspects of hardware and operating sys- tem differences in a heterogeneous, distributed environment. Mobility Feature of the π-calculus to describe the possibility of moving processes within a process system by creating new and deleting old communication links and thereby chang- ing the neighborhood of the process. Multitier In a multitier application the components of the application are distributed among several tiers, each located in a different computer in a network. Namespace A concept to uniquely separate a set of identiﬁers from other identiﬁers. Name- spaces are used to avoid name clashes. In XML, namespaces are identiﬁed by means of a unique URI. Nil value null value An artiﬁcial value in- dicating that a certain variable, element, and so on does not have a value. Nondeterminism  Feature of the π-calculus to describe the situation that the receiver of a communication cannot be predetermined when two or more processes “compete” for it. The process system evolves differently depend- ing on who wins the race.   430  Glossary  Object Constraint Language  OCL  A lan- guage deﬁning constraints, pre- and postcon- ditions, and navigation within UML diagrams. Ontology An agreement about a shared conceptualization. Complete ontologies con- sist of vocabularies, thesauri, constraints, and axioms. Parser A program that breaks a text string into a series of tokens, labeling each token with its grammatical role. Pattern  See Design pattern. Persistence The property of objects to retain their states between independent requests or sessions. π-calculus A set of formal elements and rules to represent, construct, and connect processes. Algebraic notation to describe process systems of all kinds. Primary key  A unique key  a ﬁeld or com- bination of ﬁelds  that can be used to identify an information item. Process See Business process. Protocol A valid sequence of messages ex- changed between partners. Reiﬁcation To make into a thing. Relational algebra Used to model the data stored in relational databases and queries deﬁned on the data. The main relational func- tions are the set functions like union, inter- section, and Cartesian product, plus selection  keeping only some rows  and projection  keeping only some columns . Relational algebra was developed by E. F. Codd. Relational database A database based on the relational data model. Queries in relational databases are formulated with SQL. Repository  A data store, typically based on a DBMS, where all development objects are stored. Resource manager Provides access to a set of shared resources. A resource manager participates in transactions that are externally controlled and coordinated by a transaction  manager. Database management systems are examples of resource managers. Role Active entity in a business process abstracting from real-world allocations. Roles interact and perform work steps of a process. ROLLBACK A rollback is the undoing of a partly completed transaction. See also COMMIT. SAX Simple API for XML. Provides methods for parsing XML documents and for retrieving elements. Scenario Describes the context in which a set of business processes takes place. Scenarios describe the prospective partners within these processes and their roles, and they can deﬁne a geographical, cultural, temporal, or technical context for these processes. A scenario does not describe how the partners interact nor does it describe the business processes. Schema A deﬁnition that deﬁnes the layout of a certain class of information items. Server  A computer that provides some service for other computers connected to it via a network. See also Client-server. SGML Standard Generalized Markup Lan- guage. A generic language for representing documents. SGML is deﬁned in ISO 8879:1986. Signature The signature of a method deﬁnes the parameters required when the operation is invoked. It consists of a method name and parameter types. SOAP Simple Object Access Protocol. Used as a communication method in electronic busi- ness and to establish communication between heterogeneous component-oriented platforms and to access Web services. SQL Structured Query Language. Used as an interface to relational database management systems  RDBMSs . A series of standards by ISO and ANSI culminated in SQL:1999  SQL-3 . While the original implementation of SQL in 1986 supported only ﬂat tables, SQL:1999 strives to provide relational support for com- plex objects. The query constructs of SQL:1999 are almost fully compatible with OQL.   SSL Secure Socket Layer. A security protocol that provides privacy over the Internet. States Used to represent a situation or condi- tion of an object during which certain physical laws, rules, and policies apply. The state of an object is deﬁned by the set of the values of attributes and relationships associated with that object. Associated with each state are one or more events that cause that state to change. Only states that are signiﬁcant in determining the behavior of the object are modeled. State transition A change in the state of an object caused by an event occurring to the ob- ject while it is in a given state. Stereotype Used to extend the semantics of existing UML modeling elements. Synchronization Specifying or controlling the temporal relationships between media elements incorporated in a presentation. Tag  A syntactical means to add metainfor- mation to a piece of text. In XML, tags are enclosed in brackets. TCP IP Transmission Control Protocol over Internet Protocol. TCP IP encompasses both network layer and transport layer protocols. telnet, FTP, UDP, RDP, and HTTP are based on TCP IP. Ternary association, ternary relation- ship A relationship where three roles take part. Text retrieval  The ability to effectively search across free, unformatted text. Thesaurus  A dictionary explaining a vocabu- lary, usually by relating notions to each other. Topic map  A separate document that de- scribes and interrelates the themes of a set of Web resources in an abstract way and maps these themes to the actual resources. See Sec- tion 7.2. Transaction  A coherent unit of interaction between partners. See also ACID transaction. Transaction manager  Provides the services and management functions required to sup- port transaction demarcation, transactional re-  Glossary  431  source management, synchronization, and transaction context propagation. Transformation  Process of reading an XML document that is based, for example, on a semantic vocabulary, and applying mapping rules deﬁned, for example, by XSL to produce an output document that is based on another vocabulary, for example, for presentation purposes. UDDI The Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration speciﬁcation describes a stan- dard way to register and discover Web services in shared repositories. UML Uniﬁed Modeling Language. A set of semantics and notation for precisely describing system and business models. Unicode A 16-bit character set standard. Unicode covers all major modern written languages. URI Universal Resource Identiﬁer. Identiﬁes a resource  typically a resource on the Internet  uniquely with a short string. URIs are deﬁned at www.w3.org hypertext WWW Addressing  URL URI_Overview.html. The most common kind of URIs are URLs. URL Uniform Resource Locator. Speciﬁes the address of an Internet resource, such as a Web page, an image, a sound ﬁle, a script, and so on. URLs consist of a transfer protocol speciﬁ- cation, such as http: or ftp:, a domain name, such as www.w3.org, and a path speciﬁcation, such as http:  www.w3.org hypertext WWW  Addressing URL . Web service  A software application that pro- vides a  specialized  service and can be invoked over the Internet. White space Any character that does not ink the paper when printed; for example, blank, new line, tab. Workﬂow  Result of business process model- ing with regard to implementation. Com- monly a well-structured sequence of activities performed by processing stations  human and or machine actors . Encompasses techni- cal and human allocations, document and   432  Glossary  data ﬂows. Activities are triggered and tools are launched via task lists for each actor. Workﬂow management system  A WFMS allows the setup of workﬂow models and the creation of corresponding workﬂow instances. It has control over these instances as long as they are alive. WSDL Web Service Description Language. Describes the protocol to access Web services. W3C The World Wide Web Consortium is a nonproﬁt organization responsible for the  development of World Wide Web standards  recommendations . XML Extensible Markup Language. As a “slimmed down” version of SGML, XML be- came a W3C recommendation in 1998. XSL Extensible Stylesheet Language. Consists of XPath for the selection of document nodes, XSLT for the transformation of documents, and XSL Formatting Objects for the descrip- tion of document presentation.

XML is bringing together some fairly disparate groups into a new cultural clash: document developers trying to understand what a transaction is, database analysts getting upset because the relational model doesn't fit anymore, and web designers having to deal with schemata and rule based transformations. The key to rising above the confusion is to understand the different semantic structures that lie beneath the standards of XML, and how to model the semantics to achieve the goals of the organization. A pure architecture of XML doesn't exist yet, and it may never exist as the underlying technologies are so diverse. Still, the key to understanding how to build the new web infrastructure for electronic business lies in understanding the landscape of these new standards. If your background is in document processing, this book will show how you can use conceptual modeling to model business scenarios consisting of business objects, relationships, processes, and transactions in a document-centric way. Database designers will learn if XML is subject to relational normalization and how this fits in with the hierarchical structure of XML documents. Web designers will discover that XML puts them into a position to automatically generate visually pleasing web pages and rich multimedia shows from otherwise dry product catalogues by using XSLT and other transformation tools. Business architects will see how XML can help them to define applications that can be quickly adapted the ever changing requirements of the market.
