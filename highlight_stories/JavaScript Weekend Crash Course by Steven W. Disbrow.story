If you have no programming experience, you’ll find a complete introduction to the JavaScript language along with examples of how to carry  out common Web-programming tasks. If you already know about “JavaScript the language,” you’ll find a ton of tips and techniques that you can use to enhance your existing Web sites.  Who Should Read this Book  If you need to put together a Web site that does something more than just sit there, this book is for you. Over the course of one weekend, you’ll learn about the JavaScript language and how it fits into the scheme of Web page creation. Along the way, you’ll learn about lots of other Web-based technologies and how JavaScript can work with them to create interactive and interesting Web sites. It’s important to note that this is not a JavaScript reference book! If you are looking for table after table of JavaScript language minutiae, you won’t find it here. Instead, you’ll find examples of how JavaScript can be used to solve real Web-programming challenges.  What’s in this Book  This book is divided into 30 sessions, each addressing one aspect of the JavaScript language or some technique for which JavaScript can be used. Each of these ses- sions should take you about 30 minutes to get through, although you can expect   4804-2 FM.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page x  x  Preface  to spend more time with each session if you examine the source code on the accompanying CD-ROM. Because the goal of this book is to teach you the basics of JavaScript in a weekend, it’s been broken into six parts:  cid:2  Part I contains four lessons  which should take about two hours to com- plete  that will teach you the basics of the JavaScript language and how JavaScript fits into a Web page.    cid:2  Part II is six sessions long  and should take about three hours to com- plete . It will introduce you to some of JavaScript’s built-in objects, the Browser Object Model, and the concept of browser events.   cid:2  Part III is also six sessions in length. The focus of this part of the book is  on how JavaScript can be used to dynamically create HTML and manipulate the various controls that are found in an HTML form.   cid:2  Part IV is just four sessions long, but that’s just enough time to give you an understanding of how you can create your own objects with JavaScript and use them to enhance your Web pages. The last session in this part also tells you how you can dynamically build and execute JavaScript state- ments after your Web page has been loaded.   cid:2  Part V is six sessions long. The sessions in this part focus on identifying different browsers, using Dynamic HTML and Cascading Style Sheets, and working with windows and frames.   cid:2  Part VI is four sessions long and focuses on how JavaScript can be used to communicate with other processes. These include server-side CGI processes, browser plug-ins, and Java applets.  At the end of each session, you’ll find a short summary and a set of questions, both designed to remind you of what you’ve learned in that session. At the end of each part, you’ll find twenty questions that will test how much you actually remember from the previous sessions. Some of these will be simple short-answer questions, but many are actual programming puzzles. You are encouraged to try and solve these on your own, but, if you need the answers right away, you’ll find them on your CD-ROM. Once you’ve finished the entire book, you’ll probably want to try the self-assessment test on the CD-ROM. This is a simple multiple-choice test that will give you a good idea of how much you’ve actually learned.  In keeping with the title Weekend Crash Course, you’ll find that this book is  about learning how to get things done with JavaScript. Because of that, this book is a bit different from most of the other JavaScript books out there. Whereas most books start off by telling you how fragmented the JavaScript “standard” is  each version of each browser has its own flavor of JavaScript  and then spend a tremen- dous amount of time teaching you how to work around all the differences, you’ll   4804-2 FM.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page xi  Preface  xi  be learning techniques that should work in all of the various browsers. Of course, you will learn how to work around browser differences, but you’ll find that it isn’t that hard or even all that necessary when using the latest browsers.   The text itself is adorned with icons designed to catch your attention.   The “minutes to go” icons mark your progress in the session.  The Tip icon offers information that can save you time and effort.  The Note icons highlight incidental or technical information that clarifies and expands the discussion.  The CD-ROM icon refers to material furnished on the book’s CD. Use it to find electronic versions of programs and software elements mentioned in the text.

I had always feared that writing a book would be  hard, but these guys made it seem like a piece of cake.  I’d also like to thank Lisa Swayne and everyone at the Swayne Agency for  taking a chance on me and looking out for me.   Finally, I need to thank Zack Czengöldi, Jami Lowery, and Jeff Berger for donat-  ing their time and effort to “reality check” the book as I wrote it.

 Learning a bit of JavaScript’s history  ✔ Understanding what JavaScript can and can’t do ✔ Understanding how JavaScript fits into a Web page  Creating your first JavaScript-based Web page  I n the beginning, the Web was void and without form... Well, OK. It wasn’t  really “void,” but boy was it dull! Oh sure, you could find lots of technical papers and Web sites with information about various hobbies and such, but it  was all very static and very, very dull. Then the folks at Netscape  makers of the Netscape Navigator Web browser  decided that the Web would be much more inter- esting if users could actually interact with the contents of Web pages. So, they cre- ated a scripting language called “LiveScript.”  The idea was that Web page authors would place small blocks of LiveScript code  into their Web pages. These “scripts,” as they were called, could interact directly with the elements of the Web page  for example, by inserting a string into a text box or popping up an alert window to give the user a message of some sort , creat- ing a more interesting experience for the end user.  ✔ ✔  4804-2 Ch01.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 6  6  Friday Evening  What’s that? You’ve never heard of LiveScript? That’s not too surprising, actu- ally, since LiveScript never made it out of the lab... at least not under that name. You see, at about the same time that Netscape was set to release LiveScript, Sun Microsystems announced the imminent release of a new programming language called Java.  Java appeared to have a lot going for it: Sun claimed that it was small  so you could use it in a lot of different places, including the Web , familiar  it was based on the C programming language, with which millions of programmers were familiar  and it would, eventually, run everywhere. For these reasons, and many more, Java became the hottest buzzword in the computing industry. Java’s sudden popularity got the attention of the folks at Netscape, so they looked at it and noticed some- thing very interesting: LiveScript and Java looked a lot like each other. The reason for this was that LiveScript, like Java, was based on the C programming language. In fact, the two were so similar in appearance, that if you simply glanced at a block of LiveScript or Java code, you might not be able to tell them apart!  With all the “buzz” surrounding Java, Netscape decided to change the name of LiveScript to JavaScript. This was an excellent move on Netscape’s part. The name change got people to notice and try JavaScript, and the fact that it was actually a powerful language that could do amazing things got them to create Web pages that relied on it. So it wasn’t long before JavaScript-enhanced Web pages began pop- ping up all over the Web.  Eventually, JavaScript found its way into millions of Web pages. In fact,  JavaScript became so popular that Microsoft decided to create its own version  cleverly named JScript  for use in their Internet Explorer Web browser. Unfortunately, JScript was just different enough that lots of programs written for it wouldn’t work in Netscape Navigator  and vice versa . This cost a lot of program- mers a lot of time as they struggled to create programs that worked in both browsers.  After a few years of this, everyone involved decided that a standardized version  of JavaScript would be a good idea, so they called upon the European Computer Manufacturer’s Association  an independent standards organization  to help create one. The result was called ECMAScript, though most folks still just call it “JavaScript.” ECMAScript is the version of JavaScript that you’ll find in the most modern browsers, and it’s the one that I’ll be focusing on in this book.  Note  Throughout the book, I’ll be using the terms “program” and “script” to refer to blocks of JavaScript code. While JavaScript is technically “just a scripting language,” it has all the computa- tional power of a “real” programming language. Besides, saying “JavaScript script” sounds silly when compared to “JavaScript program.”   4804-2 Ch01.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 7  S e s s i o n   1  P a r t   I  —  F r i d a y   E v e n i n g  Session 1—Getting to Know JavaScript  7  So, What Can JavaScript Do?  In today’s world, everything is hyped to the point that no matter how good some- thing actually is, once you get your hands on it, you can’t help but be disap- pointed. Fortunately, like this book, JavaScript is one of the rare exceptions that probably won’t leave you feeling let down! Among other things, JavaScript can:  cid:2  Generate custom Web pages and dynamically alter the appearance of a  Web page   cid:2  Validate the contents of a form on a Web page  cid:2  Communicate with Java “applets” in a Web page  cid:2  Create custom animations on a Web page  cid:2  Perform traditional programming language tasks  You might have noticed that most of the entries in this list involve Web pages.  However, JavaScript isn’t just restricted to Web browsers. Netscape has a server- side version of JavaScript  called LiveWire or simply Server-Side JavaScript , and Microsoft has included server-side JScript support in their Web server as well. Both of these allow you to write server-side JavaScript programs that can perform all kinds of cool and useful tasks. For example, you could pull data out of a database and present it on your Web pages, if you had the urge! Microsoft has even inte- grated JScript support into the Window’s Scripting Host  WSH . This means that you can write JavaScript programs to automate tasks in Windows 95 and later. In this book, however, we’ll be concentrating on JavaScript as it is used inside your favorite Web browser. The main reason for this is that once you learn JavaScript for the Web, you can easily take that knowledge and apply it to any of these other environments.  So, in order to complete the exercises in this book, you must use a JavaScript- capable Web browser. Fortunately, both of the “big-name” Web browsers  Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer  support JavaScript. If you don’t have one of these browsers, you’ll find them, along with all of the source code from the book, on the enclosed CD-ROM. Unless otherwise noted, all of the code in this book is “browser- agnostic” and should work with the latest version of either browser.  At the time of publication, that’s version 6 of Netscape Navigator and version 5.5 of Internet Explorer.  If you want to write browser-specific code, we’ll be covering that in Session 26 on Sunday.   4804-2 Ch01.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 8  8  Friday Evening  What JavaScript Can’t Do  Of course, JavaScript isn’t perfect. While JavaScript is very powerful, it’s also had some pretty severe restrictions placed upon it.  Note that these restrictions are mostly found in the JavaScript that runs inside your Web browser. Other JavaScript environments are a bit less restrictive.   cid:2  JavaScript can’t read, write, create, or delete disk files. This is strictly a  security issue. After all, you wouldn’t want to open a Web page that trashed all the files on your hard disk, would you?  JavaScript can create and manipulate cookies  which we will discuss tomorrow afternoon in Session 16 , but this ability is tightly controlled by the Web browser itself.    cid:2  JavaScript can’t perform operations over the network.  An exception to this rule is that JavaScript can force the Web browser to open a different Web page, which can be anywhere on the Web.    cid:2  JavaScript can’t create stand-alone software. Remember, JavaScript began  life as a way to add interactivity to otherwise static Web pages. So, JavaScript always has been  and probably always will be  a scripting lan- guage. All that means is that it’s intended to control  or “script”  the oper- ation of another program — in this case, a Web browser. If you want to write a stand-alone piece of software, you’ll need to use a more traditional language like Java, C, or C++.   cid:2  While JavaScript looks like Java, the two aren’t the same. Due to the simi-  lar names and appearance, a lot of people are under the impression that JavaScript is just a “slimmed-down” version of Java. This simply isn’t true. Java and JavaScript are two separate technologies that happen to have similar names and a similar heritage. The biggest difference between the two is that Java can create stand-alone software. While JavaScript is a powerful language in it’s own right, this is something that it just can’t do.   How JavaScript Fits into a Web Page  As mentioned earlier, JavaScript’s main purpose is to make Web pages more inter- esting and or useful. To achieve this goal, the folks that invented it decided that JavaScript programs should be embedded directly inside the Web page itself, so they invented a new HyperText Markup Language  HTML  tag that could be used to enclose JavaScript code inside a Web page. This tag is called simply the “script” tag and it looks like this:   4804-2 Ch01.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 9  S e s s i o n   1  P a r t   I  —  F r i d a y   E v e n i n g  Session 1—Getting to Know JavaScript  9    ...your JavaScript code would go here...    As you can see, the script tag looks pretty much like every other HTML tag.  There are a few differences to note though:  cid:2  It has a “language” attribute that lets you specify which programming lan-  guage is used in this script block. Depending on which browser you are using, you could also specify either VBScript or PerlScript. All the major browsers, however, support JavaScript, and, since it came first, it’s the default language. If you are only working with JavaScript, you don’t have to specify a language, but you should, just so someone looking at your code will know for sure which language you are using.   cid:2  Unlike some HTML tags, you can’t put other HTML inside a set of script  tags. JavaScript code is the only thing you should put inside a set of script tags!   cid:2  Like most other HTML tags, a Web page can contain as many sets of script  tags as you like, and you can place them just about anywhere you like inside the HTML document. However, a convention has emerged where most, if not all, of your JavaScript will probably be contained at the top of your Web page, between the   and   tags. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, as we’ll see over the next few days.   cid:2  In addition to the script tag, you can also embed JavaScript statements inside other HTML tags. These embedded JavaScript statements usually take the form of tag attributes and they are usually executed when a par- ticular condition arises in the Web browser.  These “conditions” are called “events” and we’ll be discussing them throughout the remainder of the book.    cid:2  By this point, you are probably wondering what this looks like in a real Web page. So, here’s a simple HTML file with a simple block of JavaScript code in it:        document.write “Hello World!”          4804-2 Ch01.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 10  10  Friday Evening  If you load this into your Web browser, you should see a page with the simple  message “Hello World!” on it. Here’s how the script works: First, you should notice that this is just a simple HTML file. As with every other simple HTML file you’ve seen, every bit of it is pure, human-readable, ASCII text. There aren’t any “bina- ries” or “plug-ins” or anything else to worry about. This is a very important point: Like every other part of your HTML file, your JavaScript code is just plain-old ASCII text!  Since this is just a simple HTML file, it is processed like every other HTML file: from the top to the bottom. So, first the   tag is processed  which tells the Web browser to turn on its HTML parser , then the   tag and then the   tag. When the browser reaches the   tag however, it does some- thing a little different: It turns over processing to the JavaScript interpreter that is built into the browser. The JavaScript interpreter looks at each line of JavaScript and runs it immediately. In this case, the single line of JavaScript tells the inter- preter to document.write “Hello World!” . Without getting into too much detail, “document” is an object that represents the HTML document that’s cur- rently loaded into the Web browser. The “write” part of the statement tells the document object that you want to display a string in that HTML document. Finally, “Hello World!” is the string that you want to display.  We’ll be looking at the doc- ument object in Session 9, tomorrow morning.  When the interpreter reaches the end of the script block  signified by the   tag , it turns control back over to the HTML parser. The HTML parser then finishes up by parsing the ending   and   tags and displaying the page in the browser.  Tip  The fact that JavaScript code is just simple ASCII text means that you can create your JavaScript-based HTML files using any editor that can save text files. For example, on the Macintosh, you can use SimpleText. If you are using Windows, you can use WordPad or even Notepad. If you are using Linux, you can use vi or any other editor that came with your distribution! Of course, you can also use a specialized editor that’s intended for creating Web pages. The point however, is that you don’t have to! I’ve built complex Web sites that were full of JavaScript using nothing more than Notepad. For this book, I’ll assume that you are using HTML Kit  on Windows  or BBEdit Lite  for the Macintosh . These are freeware editors with extensions to make creating Web pages much easier.   4804-2 Ch01.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 11  Session 1—Getting to Know JavaScript  11  Creating Your First JavaScript Program  I’ve always been of the opinion that the best way to learn a new programming lan- guage is to define a small project and then use that language to complete it. So, over the course of this weekend, that’s exactly what we’ll be doing. In particular, what we are going to do is create a JavaScript-based shopping cart application. Shopping carts are fairly simple, but building one will allow us to exercise almost every aspect of the JavaScript language. All we have to decide now is what we’ll be putting into our shopping cart. Since everyone loves babies, our shopping cart will be for the fictional baby supply store, baby-palooza.com. Since we’ve already seen how to output a string in our obligatory “Hello World!” script, let’s rework it a bit to create an initial welcome page for our storefront.   S e s s i o n   1  P a r t   I  —  F r i d a y   E v e n i n g      Welcome to Baby-Palooza!          document.write “Welcome to Baby-Palooza!”            This is almost exactly the same as the example we looked at earlier. The main difference is that we’ve placed our JavaScript code smack in the middle of some HTML markup tags. The end result is, when you load this page, you get a centered heading welcoming you to the baby-palooza.com site, as shown in Figure 1-1.  Figure 1-1 The output of the code    4804-2 Ch01.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 12  12  Friday Evening  If you are wondering why it works this way, remember that HTML files are  processed top to bottom. When the HTML parser reaches the opening   tag, it’s already processed the opening   and   tags and put them into the stream of output that will eventually end up going to the browser window. So, when the document.write   statement executes, its output  which is the string “Welcome to Baby-Palooza!”  is sent to this output stream as well. In fact, as far as the browser is concerned, the code you just saw might as well have looked exactly like this:      Welcome to Baby-Palooza!       Welcome to Baby-Palooza!        Being able to mix HTML tags with the output of JavaScript statements is one of  the most powerful features of a JavaScript-capable browser. In fact, this ability is the heart and soul of the dynamic, interactive Web that we’ve come to know and love!  REVIEW  In this session, you learned about the history of JavaScript. More importantly, you learned how JavaScript fits into a Web page. We also briefly touched on how HTML pages are parsed and the fact that you can mix the output of JavaScript with HTML tags. Everything else that we discuss this weekend is built on these con- cepts, so be sure you’ve got a good handle on them before proceeding!  QUIZ YOURSELF  1.

These can seem baffling at first, but you’ll find that for the most common programming tasks  like assigning a  value to something or comparing things , you only need to be familiar with a handful of them.  ✔ ✔  4804-2 Ch02.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 14  14  Friday Evening  Assignment Statements  The most basic of JavaScript statements is the assignment statement. As the name implies, the purpose of an assignment statement is to assign a value to a variable. Here are some examples:  fName = “Maia”; lName = ‘Disbrow’; count = 10 pi = 3.14159;  As with most other languages, the structure of these statements is quite simple: A variable on the left-hand side of the equal sign takes on the value that is on the right-hand side of the equal sign. Even though these are simple statements, they actually demonstrate a couple of important rules of JavaScript programming:  cid:2  You can enclose strings in either single-quotes  ‘ ‘  or double-quotes  “ “ . The quotes you use are really just a matter of your preference. Also, a string enclosed in one type of quote can contain the other type of quote. However, if you are going to nest quotes, you can only do so up to one level deep. For example, the string “Brian O’Toole” is enclosed in double-quotes and con- tains a single-quote. This is perfectly legal. However, the string “Brian O’Toole says, “Top ‘o the morning!”” would be illegal, because you can’t have double-quotes inside double-quotes.  There is a way around this limitation, which we’ll discuss in Session 5.    cid:2  JavaScript statements must end with a semicolon... or not! In JavaScript, a  semicolon marks the end of a statement. However, the end of a line also marks the end of a statement. So, if you place only one statement on each line, you do not have to use semicolons at all. However, if you want  or need  to place more than one statement on a single line, you can do so simply by placing a semicolon at the end of each one. For example, our example statements could have been written on a single line, like so:  fName = “Maia”; lName = “Disbrow”; count = 10;   JavaScript Variables  In some other programming languages, you have to declare your variables before you use them. Not only that, when you declare a variable, you have to specify what   4804-2 Ch02.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 15  Session 2—Statements and Operators  15  kind of data it will hold  an integer, a string, and so on . JavaScript does things a bit differently: In JavaScript, you create a variable simply by assigning a value to it. At that point, your variable is ready to use. If you are used to declaring your variables before using them, this shortened process can take a bit of getting used to. But once you’ve worked with it a while, you’ll find it to be quite a bit easier.  Data types  Something that’s a bit harder to deal with is the fact that JavaScript variables are loosely typed. This means that when you create a variable, the value you assign to it determines its type. So, if you assign a string to a variable, it’s a string variable. To complicate matters further, you can actually assign any type of value to any vari- able; regardless of what type of value it currently holds! Consider the following code:  S e s s i o n   2  P a r t   I  —  F r i d a y   E v e n i n g  myVar = “Hello”; document.write  myVar ; myVar = 100; document.write  myVar ; myVar = “Goodbye!”; document.write  myVar ;  Here, we create the variable myVar and assign a string to it. After displaying  this string, we assign it an integer and display that. Then, to bring things full cir- cle, we assign another string to myVar and display it. As you might imagine, loose data typing is a very powerful feature of JavaScript that allows you to write some very flexible code. However, if you abuse this feature, it can lead to problems that are difficult to track down and fix. My advice is to assign only one type of data to any given variable and use this feature only when absolutely necessary.  At this point, you might be wondering what basic data types are actually avail-  able to JavaScript programs. At the lowest level, there are really only four JavaScript data types: integers, floating point numbers, characters, and Booleans  true or false . All of the other types you’ll encounter in JavaScript are objects that combine these basic data types in some way. Strings, for example, are objects that represent collec- tions of characters. We’ll discuss these other data types as we encounter them and we’ll discuss the topic of objects in great detail on Saturday evening.   4804-2 Ch02.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 16  16  Note  Friday Evening  JavaScript actually allows you to specify your numbers in four different formats: floating point, integers, octal, and hexadeci- mal. You are probably already familiar with floating point and integer numbers, but octal and hexadecimal might be new to you. Basically, octal and hexadecimal numbers are integers that are expressed in a different numerical base. Normal integers are base 10  also known as decimal  while octal numbers are base 8 and hexadecimal numbers are base 16. In JavaScript, you can specify that a number is octal by starting it with a zero  0 . For example, the statement x = 077; would assign the octal value 77  which is 63 in decimal  to x. Similarly, hexadecimal numbers are pre- ceded by the characters “0x”. So, the statement x = 0x3F; would assign the hexadecimal value 3F  which is also 63 in decimal  to x. If this is a bit confusing, don’t worry! There are only a few instances in JavaScript programming where you have to know anything about octal or hexadecimal numbers. The point of this note is just to let you know what they are so that you’ll recog- nize them when they pop-up.  Variable names  When you create and name a variable, there are a few rules that you have to follow:  cid:2  Variable names are case sensitive. That means that myVar and myvar are two completely different variables.  Actually, every aspect of JavaScript is case-sensitive, not just variable names. This means that if you want to write an “if” statement, you must use lowercase “if”; “IF” won’t work.    cid:2  Variable names must start with an alphabetic character, a dollar sign, or an  underscore and can contain letters  a to z or A to Z , digits  0 to 9 , the dollar sign  $ , or the underscore character  _ . No spaces or other special characters are allowed.   cid:2  For all practical purposes, variable names can be as many characters long as you want. However, to keep things manageable, you should probably keep them under 50 characters long.  To help put all of this into perspective, Table 2-1 contains examples of several  valid, and invalid, JavaScript variable names.   4804-2 Ch02.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 17  Session 2—Statements and Operators  17  Table 2-1 Examples of Variable Names   Valid Names numBottles  _systemName  $charVar  _99FlagVal  Invalid Names 99bottles_of_beer  name of system  char-var  Why It’s Invalid Starts with a digit  Includes spaces  Hyphen not allowed  o’toole’sbar&grill  Apostrophe not allowed  S e s s i o n   2  P a r t   I  —  F r i d a y   E v e n i n g  Assignment Operators  At the beginning of this lesson, I said that the equal sign represents a “simple” assignment statement. JavaScript features a host of other assignment operators that, while not really complex, certainly aren’t simple, either. These operators allow you to perform operations in a single JavaScript statement that would take two or more statements in some other languages.  Perhaps the most useful of these other operators is the “addition with assignment” operator  += . What does this operator do? Well, consider the following code:  It turns out that the operation shown here  adding two variables together and  putting the result back in one of them  is so common that folks could save a lot of time if there were a shorthand operator for it. That’s exactly what the += operator is. So, assuming that x and y are defined as shown in the preceding code, the fol- lowing lines of code have exactly the same effect:  The += operator  x = 10; y = 5; x = x + y;  x = x + y; x += y;  So, that saves us about four keystrokes, right? That might not sound like a lot,  but if you multiply that over a lifetime’s programming, you’ve seriously reduced your chances for a repetitive stress injury!   4804-2 Ch02.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 18  Friday Evening  18  +=  -=  *=   =  %=  &=  =  ^=  So, what are the other assignment operators? Table 2-2 has the answers.   Other assignment operators  Table 2-2 JavaScript Assignment Operators  Operator =  Operation Simple assignment  Sample Code x = y;  Equivalent To N A  Assignment with addition  Assignment with subtraction  Assignment with multiplication  Assignment with division  Assignment with modulo  Assignment with bitwise AND  Assignment with bitwise OR  Assignment with bitwise XOR  x += y;  x -= y;  x *= y;  x  = y;  x %= y;  x &= y;  x = y;  x ^= y;  x = x + y;  x = x - y;  x = x * y;  x = x   y;  x = x % y;  x = x & y;  x = x  y;  x = x ^ y;  Hopefully, most of the operators in this table will seem straightforward to you.  The last four however, involve mathematical operations that you might not be familiar with. So, let’s talk about mathematical operators.  Mathematical Operators  Thus far, all we’ve looked at are simple assignments: copying one variable to another or setting a variable to some simple value. In the real world, most assign- ment statements involve some sort of calculation. So, JavaScript is equipped with several different mathematical operators to make those operations as easy as possi- ble. These are shown in Table 2-3.    4804-2 Ch02.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 19  S e s s i o n   2  P a r t   I  —  F r i d a y   E v e n i n g  Session 2—Statements and Operators  19  Table 2-3 JavaScript Mathematical Operators1  Operator ++  Operation Increment by 1  Sample Code x++  Result 11  --  Decrement by 1  x--  Equivalent To x = x + 1;  x = x - 1;  Addition  Subtraction  z = x + y  z = x – y  Multiplication  z = x * y  Division  Modulus  Bitwise AND  Bitwise OR  Bitwise XOR  z = x   y  z = x % y  z = x & y  z = x  y  z = x ^ y  9  13  7  30  3  1  2  11  9  N A  N A  N A  N A  N A  N A  N A  N A  For all examples, assume x is 10, y is 3, and z is 0.  Since you are almost certainly aware of the four basic math operations of addi-  tion, subtraction, multiplication, and division, let’s look at the other operators.  The increment and decrement operators  When programming, it’s often necessary to increment the value of a variable by one. For example, the following code might look very familiar: x = x + 1  The increment operator allows us to replace this code with the following: x++ This is exactly the same as the statement x = x + 1.  More importantly, by having this functionality in an operator we can perform increment operations inside other statements!   We’ll see this in Session 3, when we discuss flow of con- trol statements.   Another important aspect of the increment operator is that it can be used in either prefix or postfix form. In other words, you can put the operator before or after the variable you want to increment. Like so:  +  -  *     %  &    ^  1  ++x x++   4804-2 Ch02.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 20  20  Friday Evening  In these simple statements, the position of the increment operator doesn’t  really matter. However, in a more complex statement, the position of the incre- ment operator is important.  In prefix form  ++x , the increment operation takes place before the value of x is used in the surrounding statement.  In postfix form  x++ , the increment operation takes place after the value of x is used in the sur- rounding statement.  Consider this code:  x = 10; y = 0; z = 5; y = z * x++; y = z * ++x;  After we execute the statement, y = z * x++, the variable y will contain the  value 50 and the variable x will contain the value 11.  Because we used the postfix form of the increment operator, the initial value of x, 10, is used for the multipli- cation and the incrementing of x does not take place until after the multiplication is complete.  When we execute the next statement, y = z * ++x, the variable y will contain the value 60 and the variable x will contain the value 12. This is because, by using the prefix form of the increment operator, the value of x was increased from 11 to 12 before the multiplication occurred.  If there’s an increment operator, there should be a decrement operator, right?  Right! The decrement operator is represented by two minus signs, and it works just like the increment operator, except it subtracts one instead of adding one. For example, these two lines are equivalent:  x = x – 1 x--  Modulus operator  The increment and decrement operators are actually pretty simple once you know what they do. The modulus operator  %  however, can take some explaining. You can think of the modulus operation as a cousin of division. The difference is that a modulus operation divides its two operands and then returns the remainder of that division. So, going back to the example in Table 2-3, we divide 10 by 3. Three goes into 10 three times, with one  1  left over. This remainder, one, is what is returned.  Bit flag operators  The final types of mathematical operators are the bit flag operators. These opera- tors work only with integer values and treat them as if they were a series of flags,   4804-2 Ch02.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 21  S e s s i o n   2  P a r t   I  —  F r i d a y   E v e n i n g  Session 2—Statements and Operators  21  each specifying a true or false value, instead of whole numbers. By using the bit flag operators you can find out  or change  the state of a single bit  or a set of bits  inside a value. The use of these operators is a bit complex  no pun intended  so we’ll be discussing them in detail later.  Comments: The Statements That Aren’t  The last type of JavaScript “statement” we need to discuss is the comment. Comments aren’t really statements, they are lines or blocks of text that you put into your JavaScript code to explain what is going on. Comments can be very help- ful to anyone who might have found your JavaScript code on the Internet and is trying to adapt it for their own use. Comments can also be very helpful to you. Just imagine writing a very clever piece of code and then not looking at it again for a month or longer. Without comments, there’s a good chance that your own code would have you scratching your head in bewilderment.  If you want to designate a single line as a comment, you simply place two  slashes      at the start of your comment text. For example:     Now we square x x = x * x  These comment markers can actually come anywhere on the line. For example:  x = x * x    now we square x  The trick is that everything that comes after the comment marker is treated as a  comment, even JavaScript code!     Both of these lines are comments and will be ignored!    x = x * x  As you can see from the previous example, you can mark multiple lines as com- ment lines. However, if you need to mark a lot of lines as comment text, it can be tedious to mark each one individually. So, JavaScript allows you to mark a block of text as one big comment by enclosing it between  * and *  characters. For example:   * Now we square x to achieve the desired result *  x = x * x   4804-2 Ch02.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 22  22  Friday Evening  As with single-line comments, multiple-line comments can also start anywhere on the line. Anything  even JavaScript code  between the start and ending com- ment markers is treated as a comment and ignored by the JavaScript interpreter.  The important thing about comments is to use them. Don’t be afraid to sprinkle  comments liberally throughout your JavaScript code. Be descriptive, be detailed, be funny if you want, just be sure to do it. The first time you have to revisit a piece of your own code, you’ll be glad those comments are there.  REVIEW  In this session, you learned about simple JavaScript statements and operators. You also learned about JavaScript data types and variables. You learned how to name a variable as well as what constitutes an illegal variable name. You also found out that JavaScript variables are loosely typed. This means that they take on the type of whatever value you assign to them. It also means that any given variable can be assigned any type of data. We also went over the basic JavaScript operators and saw examples of how each one works. We’ll be using these operators extensively over the next couple of days, so be sure to keep Table 2-2 and Table 2-3 earmarked for easy reference.  QUIZ YOURSELF  1.  Is _of_pies a legal JavaScript variable name? What about _numPies? Why or why not?  See “Variable names.”   2. What is wrong with the following statement? greet = “I said  3.  “Howdy!””  See “Assignment Statements.”  If x is 33 and y is 67, what is the value of x after the following statement executes? x += y;  See “Other assignment operators.”  If x is 12, y is 4, and z is 2, what is the value of each of these variables after the following statement executes? x *= z++ * ++y;  See Table 2-2.  5. Assuming the following is all on a single line, what is wrong with the fol-  4.  lowing line of code? x = 1  y = 12 z = 100;  See “Assignment Statements.”    4804-2 Ch03.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 23  S E S S I O N  3  Flow of Control Statements  Session Checklist  ✔ Understanding Boolean values, expressions, and operators ✔ Understanding code blocks and flow of control statements  A t this point, we’ve seen how JavaScript code fits into a Web page and we’ve  seen how to create basic JavaScript statements. But, if we want to deliver truly dynamic content on our Web pages, we need to be able to make  choices in our JavaScript programs.  Understanding Boolean Values and Expressions  As we saw in Session 2, JavaScript allows you to create and use variables contain- ing Boolean values. “Boolean” is just a fancy word that means “true or false.” So, you can create variables that look like this:  shoppingCartEmpty = false; readyToCheckout = true;  Notice that these values aren’t in quotes. That’s because true and false are JavaScript keywords that have a special meaning to the JavaScript interpreter. A keyword  often called a reserved word  is a word that is reserved for use by the   4804-2 Ch03.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 24  24  Friday Evening  JavaScript interpreter. This means that these words can’t be used for variable or function names.  We’ll discuss functions in the next session.  These keywords rep- resent Boolean or logical values.   If you aren’t familiar with Boolean values, working with them can be a bit  strange at first. Boolean values represent absolutes: A Boolean variable is either true or false — there is no middle ground. You might also want to think of Boolean values as switches representing on  true  or off   false .  You’ll also find Boolean values sometimes represented by the numbers one and zero — true and false, respectively. Actually, any value other than zero can be used to represent true.   If you compare this with a string variable  which can have an almost infinite number of values , you might think that Boolean variables are a bit useless. But, the fact that Booleans can have just two values makes them ideal for making choices in a program.  Before you can make a choice in your JavaScript program, you have to express  that choice in a way that the JavaScript interpreter can understand. To do this, you have to write a Boolean  or logical  expression of some sort. Don’t let this jar- gon scare you; a logical expression is really just a true false question and its answer. In fact, without realizing it, you ask and answer logical questions every day of your life. Questions like, “Do I have enough money for a soda?” You answer this simply by digging the change out of your pocket, adding it up, and comparing the total to the cost of a soda. Based on the result of the comparison  true or false , you either buy the soda or you don’t. Asking logical questions in a JavaScript program is just as easy. You simply compare the value of one variable  the amount of change in your pockets  to some other value  the cost of the soda  and then react based on the result  which is true or false .  Comparison operators  In the above example, the comparison we were making was to see if the amount of change we had was less than or equal to the cost of a soda. However, there are lots of other types of comparisons you can make in JavaScript. Each type of compari- son has its own operator and the result of any of these comparisons will be either a true or false Boolean value. Table 3-1 shows these operators and gives an example of their use. The first four of these operators should be familiar from high school algebra class. However the last two might require a bit of explanation.   4804-2 Ch03.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 25  S e s s i o n   3  P a r t   I  —  F r i d a y   E v e n i n g  Session 3—Flow of Control Statements  25  Table 3-1 Comparison Operators1  Operator <  Operation Less than  Greater than  >  <=  >=  ==  !=  Less than or equal to  Greater than or equal to  Equality  Inequality  not equal   1  For all examples assume w is 9, x is 10, y is 10 and z is 20.  Sample Code w < z  w > z  w <= z  z >= x  x == y  x != y  Result true  false  true  true  true  false  The equality operator In some programming languages, you can test for equality simply by using a single equal sign, like so: areEqual = x = y; The problem with this method is that, in this single statement, the equal sign is being used two different ways: as a test to see if x and y are equal and to assign the result of this comparison to the variable areEqual. This is perfectly fine for a simple statement like this one, but in more complex statements, things can become a lot more difficult to follow. JavaScript removes this problem by using distinct operators for an assignment operation  a single equal sign  and an equality comparison  two equal signs . So, in JavaScript this example statement would be rewritten as: areEqual = x == y; This state- ment says, “Compare the values of x and y. If they are equal, put a true into the variable areEqual. If they are not equal, put a false into areEqual.”  Tip  In JavaScript, a single equal sign always represents an assign- ment operation, regardless of the context in which it appears. This fact is probably the largest source of errors in JavaScript programs.  We’ll see an example of this later in this session.  So, if your JavaScript program is behaving strangely, the first thing to check is whether or not you have correctly used two equal signs when you are testing for equality.   4804-2 Ch03.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 26  26  Friday Evening  The inequality operator In other programming languages, you’ll usually see a test for inequality written using a less than     symbol: areNotEqual = x   y; If you read this literally, you are asking “Is x less than or greater than y?” This is, frankly, a little confusing. Fortunately, JavaScript is able to express the concept of inequality a little better. In JavaScript there is a special symbol used specifically for expressing the concept of not: the exclamation point  ! . So, to test for inequality, you would code: areNotEqual = x != y; Which can be read literally as “Is x not equal to y?”  The operators you’ve seen so far let you compare one value to another and gener- ate a Boolean result. But, what if you need to base your decision on two or more Boolean values? As shown in Table 3-2, JavaScript has several operators to help you do just that.  Logical operators  Table 3-2 Logical Operators2  Operator Operation &&  Logical AND  Sample Code bool3 = bool1 && bool2; false  Value of bool3    ^  !  2  Logical OR  Exclusive OR  bool3 = bool1  bool2; true  bool3 = bool1 ^ bool2;  true  Logical negation  not  bool3 = !bool1;  false  For all examples, assume bool1 is true and bool2 is false.  The logical AND operation A logical AND operation returns a true if and only if all of the Boolean values you are ANDing together are true. If even one value is false, the entire expression will be false.   The logical OR and exclusive OR operations The logical OR operation will return a true value if any of the values you are ORing together are true. In fact, the only way a logical OR operation will return false is if all of the values in the expression are false.   4804-2 Ch03.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 27  S e s s i o n   3  P a r t   I  —  F r i d a y   E v e n i n g  Session 3—Flow of Control Statements  27  The exclusive OR operation is a bit trickier than a logical OR. An exclusive OR expression is true if  and only if  exactly one of the values in the expression is true. If both values are true  or both values are false , the exclusive OR expres- sion will be false.  The logical negation operation The logical negation operation is a bit different from the operations you’ve looked at so far. The difference is that negation simply reverses the Boolean value that it’s applied to. So, if you negate a true value, you get false. Similarly, if you negate a false value, you get true. To use the variables from Table 3-2  where bool1 is true and bool2 is false , here are some examples of negation  and the other operators  at work:  bool3 = !bool2;                bool3 will be true bool3 = ! bool1 && bool2 ;     bool3 will be true bool3 = ! bool1  bool2 ;     bool3 will be false bool3 = ! bool1 ^ bool2 ;      bool3 will be false bool3 = ! bool1 && !bool2 ;    bool3 will be false  There are a couple of things to notice here:  cid:2  When you want to negate an expression or Boolean variable, you just slap  an exclamation point up against its left-hand side.   cid:2  You can use parentheses to “nest” operations in the order you want them  to be carried out. In the second example, the parentheses tell the JavaScript interpreter that you want the logical AND carried out first. The result of that operation  false  will then be negated to give the final result of true. Compare this with the last example, where bool2 is negated before it is ANDed with bool1.  Understanding Flow of Control Statements  As I said at the beginning of this session, in order to create really interesting pro- grams, you have to be able to make decisions. So now that you’ve got a basic understanding of Boolean values and how they can be tested, let’s look at the JavaScript statements that use them to make decisions.  The basic idea behind flow of control statements is that they let you decide  which block of code you want executed based on some condition. Of course, hav- ing said that, I now have to define what a block of code is.   4804-2 Ch03.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 28  28  The code block  Friday Evening  In the simplest terms, a block of code can be one of two things:  cid:2  A single line of code.  cid:2  Zero or more lines of code that are enclosed by a set of curly braces  {} . As far as the JavaScript interpreter is concerned, all of the code between the curly braces is the same thing as a single line of code.  So, for example, this is a block of code: x = x + y; And this is a block of  code too:  { y = 10; x = 20; document.write  “Hello!” ; }  things up.  The if and if . . . else statements  If this is a bit confusing, don’t panic! The examples to come should help clear  The simplest flow of control statement that JavaScript has to offer is the if state- ment. This statement lets you easily decide if a block of code will execute. For example:  strollerPrice = 199; if  strollerPrice <= 100   document.write  “This stroller is cheap!” ;  document.write  “Thanks for shopping at Baby-Palooza.com!” ;  How does this work? Well, following the if keyword, there is a Boolean expres-  sion  also known as a conditional expression  contained in parentheses.  In JavaScript, conditional expressions are always in parentheses.  If this expression evaluates to a value of true, we’ll execute the block of code after the condition. In this case, that’s just a single statement. So, if the value of strollerPrice is less than or equal to 100, the first document.write statement will be executed. Otherwise, the first document.write statement will be skipped entirely.  It’s important to note here that this if statement will only trigger the execu- tion of one statement. The second document.write statement is not a part of the if statement and will be executed regardless of the outcome of our conditional   4804-2 Ch03.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 29  S e s s i o n   3  P a r t   I  —  F r i d a y   E v e n i n g  Session 3—Flow of Control Statements  29  expression. If you want more than one statement to be executed, you have to enclose all of those statements inside a set of curly braces, like this:  if  strollerPrice <= 100  {  document.write  “This stroller is cheap! “ ; document.write  “You certainly are getting a deal . . .” ; }  document.write  “Thanks for shopping at Baby-Palooza.com!” ;  At this point, I should probably say something about coding style. You’ll notice  in this example that the opening curly brace is on the same line as the if state- ment and that the closing curly brace is on its own line, indented to be even with the lines above it. You’ll also notice that I always put a space between an opening parenthesis and whatever comes after it. I’ll be using this style throughout this book, but there isn’t anything magical about it. It’s purely a personal style that I’ve developed over the years that, for me, makes source code more readable. JavaScript ignores white space characters  spaces, tabs, and carriage returns , so you can arrange your blocks of code in the manner that’s the most readable to you.   When used all by itself, the if statement is really only good for one thing:  excluding a block of code from being executed. What if you need to choose between two blocks of code? Well, in this case, you can use the if statement along with an else statement, like this:  if  strollerPrice <= 100  {  document.write  “This stroller is cheap!” ; } else {  document.write  “This stroller is not so cheap.” ; }  The concept here is very simple: if the condition in parentheses evaluates to  true, then you execute the code block immediately following the condition. Otherwise, execute the block of code following the else keyword.  You might have noticed here that both blocks of code in this example are only one statement long, yet I’ve enclosed each in curly braces. Why do this? Well, for one thing, it’s important for you to realize that you can do it this way. Also, it’s just a good idea to enclose single-line blocks of code in curly braces. Doing so removes any ambiguity as to which statements belong to a flow of control state- ment. Plus, if you have to go back and add more statements to a block of code, you won’t have to remember to add the curly braces, because they will already be there!   4804-2 Ch03.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 30  30  Friday Evening  When you need to make a complex decision, you can nest several if . . .  else statements For example, consider this code:  strollerPrice = 199; if  strollerPrice < 100  {  if  strollerPrice < 50  {  document.write  “Wow! This is cheap!” ; } else {  document.write  “Very affordable!” ; }  } else {  }  if  strollerPrice > 150  {  document.write  “This is a high-end model!” ; } else {  document.write  “A bit pricey, but nice!” ; }  In this code, we’re using nested if . . . else statements to zero in on pre- cisely how much a stroller costs and then print an appropriate message based on that cost.  The assignment error  Earlier in this session, when I talked about the equality operator, I noted that in JavaScript a single equal sign always represents an assignment operation. Why is this important to know? Consider the following code:  strollerPrice = 199; if  strollerPrice = 50  {  document.write  “This stroller is only $50! ” ; }  document.write  “Actually, the price is: $” + strollerPrice ;  In this example, you’ll notice that I’m using the addition symbol to “add” a  number to a string. When you use the +operator like this, JavaScript will automat- ically convert the number to a string and concatenate it with the string! You’ll also notice that I’m writing out an HTML   tag as part of our output.  Just so you know,   is the XHTML version of  . I’ll be using XHTML coding   4804-2 Ch03.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 31  S e s s i o n   3  P a r t   I  —  F r i d a y   E v e n i n g  Session 3—Flow of Control Statements  31  conventions throughout this book.  When you run this script, you’ll find that both document.write statements have executed. Worse still, the value of strollerPrice has been changed from 199 to 50! What happened? Well, remem- ber, a single equal sign is an assignment statement, regardless of context. So, even though the single equal sign is inside the conditional expression of an if state- ment, the JavaScript interpreter still assigns the value of 50 to strollerPrice.  But, why does this condition evaluate to true? Remember, Boolean logic is  absolute, so something is either true or false. Also remember that Boolean val- ues are sometimes represented as numbers: 1 for true and 0 for false. Actually, any value  numbers or strings or whatever  other than 0 is considered to be true. Only a numerical 0 is equivalent to false. So, the result of our “conditional expression” is 50, which evaluates as true.  As I said before, this insidious problem is probably the top cause of bugs in  JavaScript programs. So be sure to keep your eyes open for it in your own programs!  The switch and break statements  A close relative of the if statement is the switch statement. This statement allows you to very quickly choose between the known values of a variable and exe- cute a corresponding code block. It’s not quite as flexible as an if statement, but it’s easy to follow and fast. For example, let’s rework the previous example as a switch statement.  strollerPrice = 199; switch  strollerPrice  {  case 49: {  document.write  “Wow! This is cheap!” ; break; }  document.write  “Very affordable!” ; break; }  document.write  “A bit pricey, but nice!” ; break; }  document.write  “This is a high-end model!” ; }  }    end of switch statement  case 99: {  case 149: {  default: {   4804-2 Ch03.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 32  32  Friday Evening  First comes the switch keyword, followed by the variable to test in parentheses. Inside the code block that follows, there are several case statements. Each of these is followed by a constant value that the variable will be tested against. If the value of the variable matches any one of these constant values, the code block following that case statement will be executed. If the value being tested doesn’t match any of the cases, the statements following the default keyword will be executed.  Note that if you know and list all the possible cases, you don’t have to specify a default statement.  As shown here, strollerPrice doesn’t match any of the specified cases, so this will jump right to the default statement and tell the user, “This is a high- end model!” But, if strollerPrice were set to 99, this same code would write out the string “Very affordable!” and then execute the break statement that follows. The break statement will break out of the current flow of control statement. When the JavaScript interpreter encounters a break statement, it immediately halts the flow of control statement it’s in and resumes execution with the next statement immediately following the flow of control statement.  The break statement will work with any flow of control statement, but it’s espe-  cially important to know how to use it with a switch statement. This is because, without a break between case statements, execution will fall through to the next case statement and execute the code block associated with that case, whether or not the case is a match for the test variable! For example, if you were to remove all of the break statements from the previous example, and set strollerPrice to 49, all of the document.write statements in the switch would be executed!  Give it a try with the source code on your CD-ROM.  This behavior can be confusing, but it can also be useful in some situations where you need or want multiple cases to be selected at one time. So, always remember to put break statements between your cases, but keep looking for ways to use this behavior to your advantage.  The while and do . . . while statements  I’ve shown you how to select one block of code or another, but what if you need to perform a block of code over and over again? JavaScript has several statements that let you do just that. The first of these is the while statement. The while statement is fairly simple, it simply repeats a block of code until some conditional expression becomes false. For example:  stockPrice = 100; while  stockPrice > 0  {  document.write  “Our stock is currently: $” + stockPrice +  “ share ” ; stockPrice -= 10; }   4804-2 Ch03.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 33  S e s s i o n   3  P a r t   I  —  F r i d a y   E v e n i n g  Session 3—Flow of Control Statements  33  The key parts of this example are the conditional expression  stockPrice > 0   and the statement that lowers the stockPrice each time through the loop. The conditional expression is evaluated before the loop executes. If this expression eval- uates to false, the code block after the condition is not executed. If however, the condition is true, the code block is executed. When the code block finishes, the condition is checked again, and, if it’s still true, the code block executes again.  The statement that changes stockPrice is just as important. Without this  statement, stockPrice would never change, our condition would never become false, and our loop would never end! This turn of events is called an infinite loop. If you ever accidentally introduce an infinite loop into one of your JavaScript pro- grams, it will appear as if the browser has hung up. In most cases, the browser will, after a few minutes, tell you that the script has been running longer than expected and give you the chance to stop the script.  If not, you’ll have to manu- ally close your Web browser using whatever task management facilities are avail- able in your operating system.   The main problem with the while statement is that if the condition is false when you first try to execute the statement, your code block will never be exe- cuted. If you need to make sure that your code block is executed at least once, use a do . . . while statement instead. The following code, for example, wouldn’t display anything at all if it were written as a while loop. However, in do . . . while form, it’s immediately apparent that this particular stock has become worthless.  document.write  “Our stock is currently: $” + stockPrice +  “ share ” ; stockPrice -= 10; } while  stockPrice > 0 ;  stockPrice = 0; do {  The for statement  The most powerful flow of control statement is undoubtedly the for loop. While a bit difficult to master, the for loop gives you more control over your looping oper- ations than any of the other statements. Conceptually, the basic format of a for loop is this:  for  initialConditionSetup; endOfLoopTest; conditionModifier  {  codeBlock; }   4804-2 Ch03.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 34  34  Friday Evening  So, if I want to write a for loop to add up the value of all the strollers I have in  stock, I can code something like this:  strollerPrice = 199; numStrollers = 15; totalValue = 0; for  counter = 1; counter <= numStrollers; counter++  {  totalValue += strollerPrice; }  document.write  “Stroller inventory is worth: $” + totalValue ;  Notice that inside the parentheses are three JavaScript statements:  cid:2  The first statement, counter = 1;, actually creates a new variable named  counter that is local to the code block used in the for loop. When the loop ends, this variable is discarded.  We’ll talk about local variables in Session 4.    cid:2  The second statement, counter <= numstrollers;, is our conditional  expression that generates a Boolean result. If this result is false, then the loop ceases execution.   cid:2  The third statement, counter++, is executed once at the end of each trip  through the loop. In this case, this statement is used to increment the counter variable by one each time through the loop.  So, when this loop executes, it will execute the statement totalValue +=  strollerPrice; over and over until the counter++ statement causes counter to reach a value greater than the value of numStrollers. At that point, the loop will end, the counter variable will be discarded, and totalValue will contain a value of 2985.  The continue statement You’ll often find yourself performing a series of tests in the loops you create. In many cases, a true result will mean that it’s time to jump back to the top of the loop. The continue statement lets you do just that.  strollerPrice = 199; while  strollerPrice > 0  {  strollerPrice -= 50; if  strollerPrice > 100  {  document.write  “More than $100” + “ ” ; continue; }  if  strollerPrice > 50  {   4804-2 Ch03.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 35  S e s s i o n   3  P a r t   I  —  F r i d a y   E v e n i n g  Session 3—Flow of Control Statements  35  document.write  “More than $50” + “ ” ; continue; }  }  In this example, I’m using the continue statement to jump back to the top of  my loop whenever one of my if statements evaluates to true. The continue statement doesn’t reset any of the values in the loop, it simply skips everything up to the end of the loop.  The ?: operator The final statement we’ll look at is actually an operator. This operator, known as the conditional operator, allows you to choose between two expressions to evalu- ate. In abstract terms, here’s how it works:  result =  condition  ?  evaluate if condition is true  :  evaluate if condition is false ;  So, before the ?, we have a condition in parentheses. If that condition evalu-  ates to true, the expression between the ? and the : is evaluated. If the condition is false however, the expression after the : is evaluated. So, in the following example:  y = 10; z = 30; x =  y < z  ? y * z : y + z;  The condition is true  10 is less than 30 , so we multiply y by z and assign the  result to x.  REVIEW  In this session you’ve looked at Boolean values, logical expressions and operators, code blocks, and JavaScript’s flow of control statements. You’ve seen how all of these things work together to let you write JavaScript programs that can execute different blocks of code depending on the outcome of logical decisions you make in our programs. If you haven’t already, take some time to play with all of the source code for this session that is on your CD-ROM. Tinker around with the values assigned to the various variables and see how your tinkering affects the outcome of the programs.   4804-2 Ch03.F  4 9 01  8:13 AM  Page 36  36  Friday Evening  QUIZ YOURSELF  1.

For example, take a few minutes to look at the file Listing4-1.htm.  It’s in the Session04 folder on your CD-ROM.  As you can see, this is a long and tedious HTML document. The thing that makes it both long and tedious is that the code to output our product information is repeated over and over. What’s worse, all this HTML and JavaScript only produces the simple table shown in Figure 4-1.  ✔ ✔  4804-2 Ch04.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 38  38  Friday Evening  Figure 4-1 The short and sweet output of the long and tedious code  Creating a Function  So, the question is, “How can we use JavaScript to reduce the size of this code?” The answer is, “By writing a function.”  In the simplest terms, a function is just a code block that you give a name to.  There are a few advantages to putting your code into a function:  cid:2  You can use a function over and over again. All you have to do is call it by  its name.  This is one aspect of something technical types refer to as “encapsulation.”    cid:2  Functions can perform the same operation on different sets of values. For example, if you wrote a function to square a number, you could pass it a different number to square each time you called the function. The values you pass to a function are called parameters.   cid:2  All of the JavaScript code we’ve looked at so far has been immediately exe-  cuted as soon as the JavaScript interpreter gets to it. Functions, on the other hand, only execute when you call them explicitly.  In the Listing4-1.htm file, there are actually several places where functions would improve things. For instance, in each row of our table, we are adding the shipping cost to the product cost and displaying the result as a dollar amount. Here’s a function that will calculate the final cost for us:   4804-2 Ch04.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 39  S e s s i o n   4  P a r t   I  —  F r i d a y   E v e n i n g  Session 4—How to Write JavaScript Functions  39  function calcFinalCost  baseCost, shippingCost  {  return baseCost + shippingCost; }  This is a very simple function, but, just for fun, let’s look closely at each part of it.  cid:2  First is the function keyword. This tells the JavaScript interpreter that the code block that follows should be treated as a function and only exe- cuted when explicitly called.   cid:2  Next is the function name, which is calcFinalCost. The rules for naming functions are exactly the same as the rules for naming variables that we saw in Session 2.   cid:2  In parentheses is the list of parameters that this function expects to  receive. In this case the function is expecting two parameters: baseCost and shippingCost. These values are passed from the caller and are used in the body of the function to perform the function’s task.   cid:2  Next, is the opening curly brace that marks the beginning of the body of  the function.   cid:2  On the next line is a simple addition operation where the values of the  parameters are added together.   cid:2  Also on this line is the return keyword. As you might guess from its  name, this keyword evaluates the expression that follows it and sends the result back to whoever called the function.   cid:2  Finally, the closing curly brace marks the end of the function.  Calling a function  Now that we have this function defined, how do we actually use it? Well, the fol- lowing code shows how the function would be used to help create the last row of the output shown in Figure 4-1  You can find the complete code on your CD-ROM. Look for the file called Listing4-2.htm. :      document.write  “$” + calcFinalCost carSeatPrice, carSeatShip  ;       4804-2 Ch04.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 40  40  Friday Evening  As you can see, we invoke our function simply by giving its name, followed  in parentheses  by the parameters we want to pass to it. These values are passed by position into the parameter variables we specified when we defined our function.  In other words, baseCost acquires the value in carSeatPrice and shippingCost takes on the value in shipping.  Those values are used to perform the calculation defined in the function. Finally, the result of the function is passed back to the point the function was called from and the result is used in our document.write statement.  Using a function to reduce code size  This simple function is good for discussing the concepts behind functions, but it really hasn’t made our HTML file any shorter or any less tedious, has it? So, let’s define another, slightly more complex function that will actually reduce our code size. The following code shows a function to display all relevant information for a product:  function showProductInfo  price, desc, partNo, ship  {  document.write  “ ” ; document.write  “ ” + partNo + “ ” ; document.write  “ ” + desc + “ ” ; document.write  “ $” + calcFinalCost  price, ship  +  “ ” ; document.write  “ ” ; }  So, instead of defining row after row using HTML, we can simply call this func- tion for each product and it will produce the appropriate HTML for us. To see how much this reduces the size of our code, take a look at the Listing4-3.htm file on the CD-ROM.  Understanding the finer points of functions  At this point, you’ve actually got all the information that you need to write func- tions all by yourself. However, there are a couple of additional points that I need to mention before we proceed.  In both of the examples we’ve seen, our functions have accepted several para- meters. However, functions are not required to accept any parameters at all. But, when you define a function with no parameters, you still have to include a set of parentheses after the function name.  This is called an empty parameter list.  Such a function definition would look like this:   4804-2 Ch04.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 41  S e s s i o n   4  P a r t   I  —  F r i d a y   E v e n i n g  Session 4—How to Write JavaScript Functions  41  function noParams   {     function code goes here }  And you would call it like this: myResult = noParams  ;  Note that, even  though there are no parameters being passed, you must include the empty set of parentheses after the function name.   You might have noticed that in the showProductInfo function there was no  return keyword. That’s because this particular function had no need to return any value. All of its work was accomplished using document.write statements, which took effect immediately. This is perfectly legal in JavaScript. In fact, you’ll proba- bly find yourself writing lots of functions that don’t return any values at all!  Understanding JavaScript Scope Rules  Scope is a concept that determines if a variable or function defined in one part of your program is accessible from another part of your program. It can, for example, be very useful to be able to hide a variable created in one part of a program from a function created in another part of a program.  Most programming languages offer complex scope rules and have scope idiosyn- crasies that can take months or even years to master. JavaScript, however, takes a somewhat more simplistic approach to scope. In JavaScript, there are just two types of scope:  Global  Local  Something with global scope is accessible from anywhere in your HTML file. Functions, for example, are always global. This means that any function you define can be called from any place else in the file.  As we’ll see in Session 24, functions can even be accessed from different browser windows!  Variables are global if they are defined outside of a function. Variables are local if they are defined inside a function. Additionally, you must use the var keyword to avoid confusing your local variable with any global variable that has the same name. Local variables are only accessible from the function in which they are defined.  Confused? The following example should help clear things up.  aGlobalVariable = “I’m global! ”; anotherGlobal = “I’m global too! ”;   4804-2 Ch04.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 42  42  Friday Evening  function scopeDemo   {  var aGlobalVariable = “Actually, I’m local! ”; document.write  aGlobalVariable ; anotherGlobal = “I was changed by the function! ”; }  document.write  aGlobalVariable ; document.write  anotherGlobal ; scopeDemo  ; document.write  aGlobalVariable ; document.write  anotherGlobal ;  If you run this code  it’s on the CD-ROM in the Listing4-4.htm file , you’ll see some output that you might not expect. First, this code sets up two global vari- ables.  Remember, it’s not their names that make them global, it’s the fact that they are defined outside of any function! The names are just to help you follow what’s supposed to be going on.  Then the code defines a function. After the func- tion is defined, we output the value of aGlobalVariable and anotherGlobal. As expected, these values are unchanged. Then we call our function.  The first thing the function does is to create a new local variable. As you can  see, this variable has exactly the same name as one of the global variables I’ve just created. However, since I’ve used the var keyword in this statement, the JavaScript interpreter knows that I’m creating a new variable that’s local to this function. This means that, as long as this function is executing, any reference to aGlobalVariable is actually a reference to the local variable with that name. So, when the following statement executes, it’s the value of the local variable that’s output, not the value of the global variable. However, when the next statement references anotherGlobal, the JavaScript interpreter will find that there is no local variable with that name. So, as you would expect, it assigns the new value to the global variable.  Remember, global variables are available everywhere, even inside functions!  The moment the function finishes executing, the JavaScript interpreter throws away the local variable named aGlobalVariable. From that moment on, any further references to aGlobalVariable refer to the global vari- able defined in the first line of the script.  After returning from the function, the script again outputs the values in aGlobalVariable and anotherGlobal. This time however, one of them has changed; the value in anotherGlobal is now what was assigned to it inside the function. However, the value in aGlobalVariable is unchanged.  If you still find the concept of scope confusing, here are some tips to help you  out:   4804-2 Ch04.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 43  S e s s i o n   4  P a r t   I  —  F r i d a y   E v e n i n g  Session 4—How to Write JavaScript Functions  43   cid:2  First of all, never give more than one variable the same name. Just by fol-  lowing this simple rule, you’ll save yourself an incredible amount of heartache.   cid:2  To further avoid confusion, always use the var keyword when you create variables inside your functions. Of course, the var keyword is completely optional, so why bother? Well, some older versions of Netscape Navigator actually treat variables defined inside functions as global variables, unless you use the var keyword when you define the variable. By using the var keyword consistently, you’ll never have to worry about running afoul of this strange behavior.   cid:2  You can also use the var keyword when defining global variables. This won’t make your global variables local, but it will tell someone reading your code that you were defining a variable and not just making another assignment statement.  Using External Source Code Files  As I said at the start of this session, when you write a program, you’ll find yourself doing the same things over and over again. In JavaScript programming this is true not only for a single Web page, but for entire Web sites. Therefore, it stands to rea- son that a function that’s useful on one page might come in handy on another page as well. So, what’s needed is some way to share your JavaScript functions  and other code  among all of the Web pages on your Web site. To accomplish this, the   tag supports something called the src attribute. This attribute  which stands for “source”  allows you to specify a separate file that contains JavaScript code that you want to import into your Web page. For example, consider the   tag in the following code.       Welcome to Baby-Palooza.com                 4804-2 Ch04.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 44  44  Friday Evening  In this example you can see that all of our JavaScript code has been removed from the first   block. Instead, the opening   tag looks like this:      The src attribute tells the JavaScript interpreter that you want to include the JavaScript code that can be found in the file named “babyPalooza.js”. So, the interpreter retrieves this file and parses the code it finds there just as if the code had been typed into the HTML file.  To see how all of this fits together, see the Listing4-5.htm and babyPalooza.js files on your CD-ROM.   The .js file extension on our external source file stands for, of course, JavaScript. It’s not required that external source files use this extension, but it is a good idea to do so, simply because it will clearly identify your files as JavaScript source code.  Note  The babyPalooza.js file is simply all of the JavaScript variable and function defi- nitions we have been working with throughout this session. This is what is loaded by the JavaScript interpreter in response to the src attribute in our first  . As you can see from looking at these last two files, using the src attribute can really help to reduce the overall size of your Web page. And, by plac- ing your JavaScript code in a separate file, you can easily share your functions and variable definitions between files.  REVIEW  Functions and the concept of code reuse were the focus of this session. You looked at the structure of a function as well as why you would want to use functions. You learned how functions return results and discussed the fact that some functions don’t need to return results at all. You saw how functions are called and how they can be used to reduce the overall size of a program by encapsulating tasks that are repeated over and over again. You learned about JavaScript’s scope rules, and I pointed out ways to avoid confusion when creating local and global variables.  Finally, I told you about the src attribute of the   tag and showed you how it can be used to reduce the size of a Web page and to share JavaScript vari- ables and functions among the different pages on your Web site.   4804-2 Ch04.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 45  Session 4—How to Write JavaScript Functions  45  QUIZ YOURSELF  1.

For that reason, I need to give you a closer look at JavaScript strings and the different operations you can perform  on them. As you saw last evening, strings are easy to create; you simply assign one to a variable like so:  var myString = “Welcome to Baby-Palooza!”;  This simple statement creates a new variable and assigns a string value to it.  Once this is done, you can manipulate the string in this variable in just about any way you want.  String Mechanics  Of course, at this point, I haven’t told you all the different ways you can manipu- late a string, have I? OK, grab your browser and let’s start manipulating!   4804-2 Ch05.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 52  52  Concatenation  Saturday Morning  Perhaps the most basic string operation is concatenation. In the simplest terms, concatenation is an operation where you take two or more strings and jam them together to make a bigger string. Here’s an example:  var greeting = “Welcome to Baby-Palooza!”; var beg = “Please come back soon!”; var howdy = greeting + beg;  As mentioned in Session 3, when used with a string, the plus sign acts as a con- catenation operator. So, the last statement is saying, “Take the contents of greet- ing and tack the contents of beg onto the end of it. Then put the entire thing into howdy.” After this code executes, what do you think the contents of howdy will be? If you said that howdy will contain “Welcome to Baby-Palooza! Please come back soon!” you were right.  No, this isn’t a typo, there really shouldn’t be a space between the “!” and  “Please.”  Remember, JavaScript is just a programming language, so it has no idea about the rules of grammar. Heck, it doesn’t even know that these strings repre- sent sentences!  In order to have a space between these strings, the last statement would have to look like this:  var howdy = greeting + “ “ + beg;  See what I’ve done here? I’ve explicitly placed a blank space between my two  string variables. Now, the contents of howdy will look like this: “Welcome to Baby- Palooza! Please come back soon!” This brings up several important points:  cid:2  You can concatenate string variables with hard-coded strings. Hard-coded simply means something that you’ve typed in yourself. In this example, the blank space  “ “  is the hard-coded string.  You’ll find that the term literal is sometimes used instead of hard-coded.    cid:2  You can concatenate as many string variables and hard-coded strings as  you want into one string.   cid:2  If you build strings this way, it’s entirely up to you, the programmer, to  account for spaces between strings, punctuation, and so on.  Now, as you saw in Session 2, JavaScript has a lot of operators. So, you might  be wondering if there is another concatenation operator. Actually, there is. Remember the += operator? When you use it with two numbers, it works like this:  x += y;    This is the same as . . . x = x + y;   4804-2 Ch05.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 53  S e s s i o n   5  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 5—Working with JavaScript Strings  53  So, assuming that greeting and beg are still defined as you saw earlier, what  do you think the following statement will do? greeting += “ “ + beg;  That’s right, it will take the value of greeting and concatenate it with a blank space followed by the value in beg. Then the whole thing will be put back into the greeting variable. The end result is that greeting will contain “Welcome to Baby- Palooza! Please come back soon!”  Simple numeric conversion  Strings can also be used to do simple conversions of numbers into strings. For example:  var descAndPrice = “Stroller: $” + 199;  As I’ve said before, in a case like this the JavaScript interpreter will take the  number, convert it into a string and concatenate that with the string “Stroller: $”. The result of all this will be that the descAndPrice variable will contain the string “Stroller: $199”. As you might expect, this also works for numbers with decimal places in them:  var descAndPrice = “Stroller: $” + 199.95;  If you have a number that you need to quickly convert into a string, you can do  this by concatenating it with the empty string. The empty string is a string that contains, well, nothing.  I suppose that’s why it’s called the empty string.  At any rate, the empty string is represented by an empty set of either double “” or single ‘’ quotes.  Notice that there is no space between either set of quotes.  Since the empty string is still a string, the simple act of concatenating it with the number changes the number into a string. For example:  var cost = 199; cost += “”;  String Methods and Properties  In JavaScript, strings are implemented as objects. So, when you create a string, you are actually creating a JavaScript object, a String object.  Note the capital S here. A String object is different from the string data that you find inside it.  I’ll be discussing objects in much greater detail in Session 17, so I’m not going to delve too deeply into this aspect of strings right now. But, if I want to tell you   4804-2 Ch05.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 54  54  Saturday Morning  about String object methods and properties, you’ve got to know a little about methods and properties and how they relate to objects.  In the simplest terms, an object is a chunk of data that has some sort of func- tionality attached to it. That functionality is implemented as one or more proper- ties and methods. Properties are straightforward; they are just variables that hold information about the data in the object. Strings, for example, have only one property, the length property. As the name implies, this property simply tells you how many characters are in the string data.  Methods are a bit trickier. At this point, the best way to think of methods is as  if they are functions that belong to an object.  So, when you create a String object, you are creating a chunk of data  the char- acters of the string  that has a bunch of properties and methods predefined for you to use with it. The properties give you details about the data in the object and the methods allow you to perform tasks using the data in the object. For Strings, those tasks include things like searching for a character in the string data, extracting a portion of the string data, or converting the string data to upper or lower case.  Using String methods and properties  How do you actually call one of these methods? Let’s look at an example:  var prez = “Thomas Jefferson”; var upperPrez = prez.toUpperCase  ;  Here I’ve created a String object named prez. On the next line, I’ve invoked the String method that will convert the contents of prez to upper case. As you might guess, the result of this second statement is that the variable upperPrez will con- tain “THOMAS JEFFERSON.” However, let’s look at how to invoke the method that makes this happen.  First, there’s the name of my String object, prez, followed by a period. The  period tells the JavaScript interpreter that I want to access a property or method inside the String object that I have named. So, after the period, I name what it is that I want to access, in this case, that’s the toUpperCase method.  Earlier I said that methods are like functions that belong to objects. As you can  see in this example, as with a function, the method name is followed by a set of parentheses. Some methods take parameters, just like functions do. So, just like a function, you would pass those inside the parentheses. It’s important to realize that every string you create gets access to every method that is defined for the String object. But, when you invoke a String method, it only does its work on the data in the String object that you’ve named. For example, consider this code:   4804-2 Ch05.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 55  S e s s i o n   5  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 5—Working with JavaScript Strings  55  var prez1 = “George Washington”; var upperPrez1 = prez1.toUpperCase  ; var prez2 = “Thomas Jefferson”; var upperPrez2 = prez2.toUpperCase  ;  After this executes, upperPrez1 will be “GEORGE WASHINGTON” and  upperPrez2 will contain “THOMAS JEFFERSON.” This is just as simple as it looks and works exactly the way you think it should. The prez1.toUpperCase   state- ment tells JavaScript that you want an upper case copy of the data in prez1. Similarly, prez2.toUpperCase   tells JavaScript that you want an upper case copy of the data in prez2.  With that under your belt, getting at the length property should seem pretty  simple:  document.write  prez1.length ;    writes out the value 17 document.write  prez2.length ;    writes out the value 16  Again, it’s just a simple matter of specifying which String object you want to  work with and then following that with a period and the name of the property you want to extract.  Many programming languages number the characters in a string starting with the number 1. JavaScript, however, begins number- ing characters with the number 0. So, for example, the string “Baby” has a length of 4 characters, but those characters are numbered from 0  the B  to 3  the y .   Note  String methods you can use  Now that I’ve shown you how to call a String method, what methods are there to call?  Note that, because you’ve only got a weekend to learn about JavaScript, this book is only going to cover the most useful aspects of the language. If you want to dig deeply into every nook and cranny of JavaScript  including the string methods that you won’t find in this book , check out the official language specification for JavaScript that is on your CD-ROM. It’s in the file ECMA-262.pdf.   The charAt   method This method allows you to extract a single character from a specified position in a String object. For example, give this code a try  it’s on your CD-ROM if you don’t feel like typing it in :   4804-2 Ch05.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 56  56  Saturday Morning  var greeting = “!azoolaP-ybaB ot emocleW”; for  x=greeting.length - 1; x >=0 ; x--  { document.write  greeting.charAt  x  ; }  When you run this code, you’ll see it prints out “Welcome to Baby-Palooza!” If you take a close look at the for loop, you’ll see why: I’ve begun the loop at the end of the greeting string by setting x equal to the length of greeting minus one.  Remember, JavaScript character string positions are numbered starting with 0. So, the position of the final character is the length minus one.  The loop then progresses downward  note the x-- statement in the loop condition  until it goes below 0.  Again, remember that the position of the first character in a string is 0.  Each time through the loop the charAt method extracts the character found at position x in greeting. The end result is that the string data is printed out back- wards, giving us a now familiar salutation.  The indexOf   method This method searches a String for a substring. If the substring is found, the posi- tion at which it was found is returned. If the substring isn’t found, the method will return a value of negative one  -1 . There are actually two different forms for calling this method. Here’s an example of the first one:  var itemDesc = “Stroller and SunShade”; var sunPos = itemDesc.indexOf  “Sun” ; if  sunPos != -1  {  document.write “Found ‘Sun’ at position: “ + sunPos ; } else {  document.write  “Could not find ‘Sun’!” ; }  Here I’m checking to see if the characters “Sun” exist in the itemDesc string variable. They do, so I output a short message telling me the position  13  where “Sun” was found in the string data.  As with every other part of JavaScript, each of the String methods you are seeing here is case-sensitive. So, if I had searched for “sun” instead of “Sun,” the indexOf method would not have found a match and would have returned a -1 result.   As you might imagine, the indexOf method begins looking for your substring at  the start of the string data. This is usually fine, but there might be a time when you want to exclude a portion of the string from your search. The second form of the indexOf method is intended for just such a situation:   4804-2 Ch05.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 57  S e s s i o n   5  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 5—Working with JavaScript Strings  57  var custEmail = “somebody@aol.com”; var atPos = custEmail.indexOf  “@” ; var aolPos = custEmail.indexOf  “aol”, atPos ; if  aolPos != -1  {  document.write  “Welcome AOL User!” ; } else {  document.write  “Welcome non-AOL User!” ; }  In this example, I’m testing an e-mail address to see if it belongs to a specific  domain. So, since I only need to test what’s after the @ symbol, I use the first form of indexOf to find the @. I then use that position information in the second form of indexOf. In this second form, I pass a start position after the substring you are looking for. This start position tells the method where in the string data to begin looking for the substring.  The lastIndexOf   method This method does the exact same thing as the indexOf method, except it starts searching from the end of the string data, not the beginning. As with indexOf, there are two forms of the lastIndexOf   method. In the first form, you simply specify the substring you are searching for. In the second form, you specify the substring along with a starting position. If you specify a starting position, the search will progress from that point backwards toward the beginning of the string data. Here’s an example:  var itemDesc = “Stroller and Stroller Carseat Adapter”; var strollPos = itemDesc.lastIndexOf  “Stroller” ; if  strollPos != -1  {  document.write “Found ‘Stroller’ at position: “ + strollPos ; } else {  document.write  “Could not find ‘Stroller’!” ; }  If you run this code, you’ll find that “Stroller” is reported as found at position  13 and not at position 0.  Regardless of which end the search begins from, the position returned is always counted from the start of the string data.    4804-2 Ch05.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 58  58  Saturday Morning  The split   method The split method takes a string and splits it into an array. I haven’t told you about arrays yet, but we’ll get to them soon, in Session 6.  The substring   method The substring method extracts a new String from the interior of an existing String.  var greeting = “Welcome to Baby-Palooza”; document.write  greeting.substring  11, 15  + “ ” ;    “Baby” document.write  greeting.substring  8, 10  + “ ” ;    “to” document.write  greeting.substring  16  ;    “Palooza”  The first parameter of the substring method is the starting position of the String that you want to extract. The second parameter is the position that’s one greater than the last character you want to extract. This is an important point: The character specified in the first parameter will be a part of the extracted String, but the character specified in the second parameter will not.  Another thing to notice is that the second parameter is entirely optional. If you  omit it  as I’ve done in the last line of this example  the remainder of the source String will be extracted.  The toLowerCase   and toUpperCase   methods  As you’ve already seen, the toUpperCase method returns an all UPPER CASE version of the data in a String object.  As you can probably guess, the toLowerCase method returns an all lower case version of the data in a String object.  REVIEW  You’ve just taken a long look at JavaScript Strings. You learned that JavaScript Strings are actually objects that have a length property and many different meth- ods. You also learned how to access the length property and how to call the dif- ferent String methods.   4804-2 Ch05.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 59  Session 5—Working with JavaScript Strings  59  QUIZ YOURSELF  1.

For example, in Session 4, I used the following code to hold product information:  strollerPrice = 199.95; strollerDesc = “Rock & Stroll - Deluxe”; strollerPartNo = “st-001”; strollerShip = 20; diaperPrice = 13.95; diaperDesc = “Size 3, Extra Absorbent”; diaperPartNo = “dp-003”; diaperShip = 5; carSeatPrice = 149.95; carSeatDesc = “Ultra-Safe, Rear-Facing”; carSeatPartNo = “cs-001”; carSeatShip = 15;  ✔  4804-2 Ch06.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 62  62  Saturday Morning  While this is very descriptive, it’s also a very cumbersome way to do things.  Worst of all, if my inventory should ever change, I would have to create a new set of variables  each with an appropriate name  for each product. Wouldn’t it be nice if there were a type of variable that could hold a bunch of related, but different, data all at once? Well, there is, and it’s called an array.  What Is an Array?  An array is a variable that has numbered or named slots that you can put data in. You can think of these slots as a set of individual variables inside the array. For example, the following code shows how one of the above products looks when it’s placed in an array:  var strollerInfo = new Array  ; strollerInfo[0] =  199.95; strollerInfo[1] = “Rock & Stroll - Deluxe”; strollerInfo[2] = “st-001”; strollerInfo[3] = 20;  As with strings, JavaScript arrays are implemented as objects. Unlike strings,  however, you can’t just create an array by assigning a value to a variable. Instead, you have to actually create an Array object. So, how do you create an Array object? The answer is in the first line of our example: var strollerInfo = new Array  ;  As usual, I use the var keyword to signify that I am creating a new variable,  and then I give that new variable a name  strollerInfo . This is followed by the new keyword. This keyword tells the JavaScript interpreter that I want to create a new object of some type. In this case, I want to create a new Array object. So, I follow the new keyword with a call to the Array   constructor method.  A constructor method is a special method that every type of object has. The first  thing that makes it special is that it has the same name as the type of object to which it belongs.  Yes, String objects have a constructor method named String  .  Basically, a constructor method tells JavaScript what steps to take to build a specified type of object. That’s why it’s called a constructor method; it’s actually building the object you’ve requested. So, after this line is finished, I’ve got a new Array object stored in the strollerInfo variable.  How to use an array  As I said earlier, an array can be thought of as a variable with a bunch of named or numbered slots in it. Each of these slots can hold its own chunk of data, just as if   4804-2 Ch06.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 63  S e s s i o n   6  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 6—Working with JavaScript Arrays  63  it were itself a variable.  Actually, the slots and the data in them are most often referred to as elements of the array.  To access these slots you simply give the name of the array variable, followed in square brackets by the number or name of the slot you want to access.  The number or name you assign to a slot in an array is called the index of that slot.   Using numbered array elements In the previous example, I’m using numbered slots to hold my product data. Notice that I’ve started numbering my slots with zero.  You can actually begin numbering your slots with any number you like, but beginning with zero is standard practice.   You’ve seen how to get data into an array, but how do you get data out of an  array? Well, there are lots of ways to do this, but the most common way is to process each slot in the array from inside a loop of some sort. Of course, to do that, you have to know how long the array is. That’s why, as with String objects, every Array object has a length property that tells you how many slots exist in the array.  The JavaScript interpreter automatically updates the value in this prop- erty as you add slots to the Array object.  So, with the previous example in mind, take a look at this:  for  x=0; x<strollerInfo.length; x++  {  document.write  strollerInfo[x] + “ ” ; }  When you run this code  it’s in the Listing6-2.htm file on the CD-ROM if you  don’t want to type it in , you’ll get a list of the contents of the array. The for loop simply steps through each of the slots in the array and, using the number stored in x, extracts and displays the data in each slot of the array.  Using named array elements In my first example, I used numbered slots to hold my product data rather than named slots. However, I could have just as easily have used named slots, as seen here:  var strollerInfo = new Array  ; strollerInfo[“price”] =  199.95; strollerInfo[“desc”] = “Rock & Stroll - Deluxe”; strollerInfo[“partNo”] = “st-001”; strollerInfo[“shipCost”] = 20;  One advantage of this approach is that, instead of a meaningless number,  each slot’s name tells the programmer exactly what the slot holds. The downside,   4804-2 Ch06.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 64  64  Saturday Morning  however, is that you can no longer use a numeric counter to retrieve the contents of the array. To solve this problem, JavaScript provides a special variant of the for loop designed specifically for this sort of task. An example of this is shown below.  for  x in strollerInfo  {  document.write  strollerInfo[x] + “ ” ; }  In this version of the for loop, the three expressions that would normally con-  trol the loop are replaced by the expression  x in strollerInfo . This expres- sion tells the JavaScript interpreter that each time through the loop, the value of x should become the name of the next slot in the strollerInfo array. So, the first time through the loop, x contains “price.” The second time through it con- tains “desc,” and so on. An added benefit of this approach is that, since x will take on the name of each slot, you can inspect x and use its contents to display the name of each slot. Like this:  for  x in strollerInfo  {  document.write  x + “ is “ + strollerInfo[x] + “ ” ; }  It’s important to note that if you are going to use named slots you can give  your slots any name that will fit between a set of quotes. Even if that name isn’t a valid JavaScript variable name! So, for example, the code shown here would be perfectly legal:  var strollerInfo = new Array  ; strollerInfo[“Price”] =  199.95; strollerInfo[“Product Description”] = “Rock & Stroll - Deluxe”; strollerInfo[“Baby-Palooza Part Number”] = “st-001”; strollerInfo[“Shipping Cost, Ground”] = 20; for  x in strollerInfo  {  document.write  x + “ is “ + strollerInfo[x] + “ ” ; }  This would yield the much nicer output shown in Figure 6-1.  Unfortunately, there are a couple of drawbacks to using named slots:  cid:2  With named slots, you can only step through your array in one direction, from top to bottom. With numbered slots, you can step through from the bottom  length – 1  to the top  0 .   4804-2 Ch06.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 65  S e s s i o n   6  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 6—Working with JavaScript Arrays  65   cid:2  Directly accessing an array element with a named slot requires that you know the name of the slot. If you are using verbose slot names, this can make for some very difficult programming. A better solution is to use numbered slots and set aside one slot for a detailed description of the array’s contents.  Figure 6-1 The output of the code using verbose slot names  What kind of data can you put into an array?  Actually, since JavaScript variables are loosely typed  as mentioned in Session 2 , you can actually put any kind of data into any slot of a JavaScript Array object. As you’ve already seen, you can even assign a different type of data to each slot in an array. This makes JavaScript arrays very powerful. It also lets you create a mul- tidimensional array.  What’s a Multidimensional Array?  Think of a multidimensional array as an array of arrays. Why would you ever need something like this? Well, consider our product data: In the examples I’ve shown you so far, I’ve actually only been assigning the data for one product into my array. Given what you’ve seen thus far, the information for each of the other prod- ucts would also have to be placed into its own Array object and you would then have to manipulate each of these individually. Here again, it would be very nice if there were a way to wrap all of the data into a single variable that could be easily manipulated. With that in mind, take a look this:    4804-2 Ch06.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 66  66  Saturday Morning  var strollerInfo = new Array  ; strollerInfo[0] =  199.95; strollerInfo[1] = “Rock & Stroll - Deluxe”; strollerInfo[2] = “st-001”; strollerInfo[3] = 20; var diaperInfo = new Array  ; diaperInfo[0] = 13.95; diaperInfo[1] = “Size 3, Extra Absorbent”; diaperInfo[2] = “dp-003”; diaperInfo[3] = 5; var carSeatInfo = new Array  ; carSeatInfo[0] = 149.95; carSeatInfo[1] = “Ultra-Safe, Rear-Facing”; carSeatInfo[2] = “cs-001”; carSeatInfo[3] = 15; var productInfo = new Array  ; productInfo[0] = strollerInfo; productInfo[1] = diaperInfo; productInfo[2] = carSeatInfo;  As expected, I’ve created separate Array objects to hold the information for each product. However after that’s done, I’ve also created a fourth array called productInfo. I then take this array and fill its slots with the three product infor- mation arrays I’ve already created. After doing this, I end up with an array of arrays. I can then access all of the information about all of my products through the productInfo variable.  How to access data in a multidimensional array  Accessing the data in a multidimensional array is a simple matter of specifying each index needed to drill down to the slot you want in the appropriate array. For example, the price for the car seat is kept in slot one of the third array in productInfo. So if we wanted to print this out, we would code:  document.write  “Car seat price: “ + productInfo[2][0] ;  See how this works? After the name of the multidimensional array   productInfo , I’ve specified the index  [2]  of the subarray I want to access. If you look back at the code that created this array, you’ll see that this is the slot containing my car seat information. Once I’ve zeroed in on the correct array, I sim- ply specify the index of the slot I want to extract data from  [1] . For another example, if I wanted to change the price of the diapers to $15.95, I would code:   4804-2 Ch06.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 67  S e s s i o n   6  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 6—Working with JavaScript Arrays  67  productInfo[1][0] = 15.95;  As our final example, the following code will take the arrays I just created and  display the contents of each slot.  for  x=0; x<productInfo.length; x++  {  for  y=0; y<productInfo[x].length; y++  {  document.write  productInfo[x][y] + “ ” ; }  }  Here I’m using a couple of nested for loops to display all of the data in my multidimensional array. The outer loop moves through the main array  productInfo , while the inner loop displays the contents of each subarray.  Array Methods  As we’ve seen, JavaScript arrays are actually pretty easy to work with. However, since they are objects, JavaScript arrays also come with a variety of methods that make them even more useful and powerful. In this section, we’ll look at these methods as well as the split   method that belongs to the String object.  Note that examples of each of these methods can be found on your CD-ROM in the Session06 folder.   The Array   constructor method  There are actually a couple of different ways to use the Array   constructor method.  new Array    With no parameters. As you’ve already seen, this simply creates an empty Array object.  new Array  length  With a length parameter. This creates a new Array  object with length empty slots.  new Array  item1,  With multiple parameters. This creates an  item2, etc.   Array object whose slots are filled with the items you pass as parameters.  The concat   method  This concat   method will join multiple arrays together into a single new Array object.   4804-2 Ch06.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 68  68  The join   method  Saturday Morning  This method will combine the individual elements of an array into a single string. This string will be delimited by a character that you specify when you call the join   method.   var bpArray = new Array  “Diapers”, “Baby Wipes”, “Rattle” ; var prodList = bpArray.join  “-” ;  After this code executes, prodList will contain the string “Diapers-Baby Wipes-  Rattle.” If you don’t specify a delimiter, the join   method will use a comma by default.  Compare this with the String.split   method discussed at the end of this section.   The pop   method  This method removes and returns the last element in an Array object. After this method executes, the Array’s length property will be one less than before. For example, the following code will result in lastProduct containing the string “Rattle.”  var bpArray = new Array  “Diapers”, “Baby Wipes”, “Rattle” ; var lastProduct = bpArray.pop  ;  Internet Explorer 5 on the Macintosh does not support this method or these  described later : push  , shift  , splice  , and unShift  .  Note  The push   method  This method puts a new item at the end of an Array. Afterwards, the Array’s length property will be one greater than before. After the following code exe- cutes, the bpArray variable will have a new element at its end containing the string “Diaper Cream.”   var bpArray = new Array  “Diapers”, “Baby Wipes”, “Rattle” ; bpArray.push  “Diaper Cream” ;   4804-2 Ch06.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 69  S e s s i o n   6  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 6—Working with JavaScript Arrays  69  This method will reverse the order of the elements of an Array object.  This method will remove the first element of an array  element 0  and move the other elements up one. Afterwards, the Array’s length property will be one less than before.   The reverse   method  The shift   method  The slice   method  The slice   method will return a new Array object containing a subset of the ele- ments in your original array. You simply specify a starting and ending element and this method will return a new Array object containing each element from the start- ing position to the end position minus one. In the following example the cleanUp variable will be an Array object with two elements: “Diapers” and “Baby Wipes.” Again, note that the specified ending element  element 2, “Rattle”  is not included in the new Array object.  var bpArray = new Array  “Diapers”, “Baby Wipes”, “Rattle”, “Stroller”, “Booties” ; var cleanUp = bpArray.slice  0, 2   The sort   method  The sort   method will let you sort the contents of an Array object using what- ever sorting process you want. You simply have to specify an appropriate sorting function when you call the sort   method.   function simpleSort  item1, item2  {  var result = 0; if  item1 > item2    result = 1;  if  item1 < item2   result = -1;  if  item1 == item2   result = 0; return result;   4804-2 Ch06.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 70  70  }  Saturday Morning  var bpArray = new Array  “Diapers”, “Baby Wipes”, “Rattle”, “Car Seat”, “Stroller” ; bpArray.sort  simpleSort ;  The sorting function  which you must write  will be called again and again by  the sort   method until all elements are sorted. Each time it’s called, it will receive two parameters  here called item1 and item2 . The sorting function must compare these items and return a result based on that comparison. Note that the comparison logic you use is totally up to you, but it should make sense for the type of data you are sorting. In the above example, I’m just sorting strings, so a simple string comparison is all that’s required.  JavaScript uses an alphabetical order rule to compare strings. So, “ape” is less than “zebra.”   cid:2  If item1 is greater than item2, the function should return a positive number.  cid:2  If item1is less than item2, the function should return a negative number.  cid:2  If item1is found to be equal to item2, the sorting function should return  a zero.  The sort   method uses these results to rearrange the contents of the Array in sorted order.  It’s important to note that you can write as many sorting functions as you want and use them with whichever Array objects you want. For example, you can write one function to sort items in ascending order while another sorts them in descending order.   The splice   method  The splice   method is the most complex of the Array object methods. It allows you to delete items from an Array and, optionally, insert new items in place of the old ones. In its simplest form, the splice   method can delete one or more array elements, like this:  var bpArray = new Array  “Diapers”, “Baby Wipes”, “Rattle”, “Car Seat”, “Stroller” ; bpArray.splice  2, 1 ;  The first parameter tells the method which element to start the delete opera-  tion with.  In this case, it’s element 2, “Rattle”.  The second parameter tells splice   how many elements to delete. In this case, I’ve specified a value of 1, so only the “Rattle” element will be deleted. This effectively removes the element from the middle of the array.   4804-2 Ch06.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 71  S e s s i o n   6  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 6—Working with JavaScript Arrays  71  The second form of the splice   method doesn’t actually remove any elements,  it merely replaces their contents. For example:  var bpArray = new Array  “Diapers”, “Baby Wipes”, “Car Seat”, “Stroller” ; bpArray.splice  1, 3, “Booties”, “Sun Shield”, “Baby Sling” ;  Here again, the first parameter tells splice   where to start the operation. The second parameter tells it how many elements, including the specified starting ele- ment, need to be replaced. The remaining parameters are the new values that should be assigned to the specified elements. So, after this code runs, bpArray[0] will contain “Diapers”, bpArray[1] will contain “Booties”, bpArray[2] will con- tain “Sun Shield”, and bpArray[3] will contain “Baby Sling”.  This method will combine all of the elements in an Array object into a single string. Each element will be separated by a single comma. This is exactly the same as calling the join   method without specifying a delimiter character.  The toString   method  The unShift   method  This method will add a new element to the beginning of the array and move all the old elements up one. Afterwards, the Array’s length property will be one more than before. So, after the following code executes, bpArray[0] will contain the string “Stroller.”  var bpArray = new Array  “Diapers”, “Baby Wipes”, “Rattle” ;  bpArray.unshift  “Stroller” ;  The String.split   method  The final method you need to know about isn’t an Array object method at all, it’s the split   method of the String object. As you might have guessed by now, this method takes a string and breaks it into an Array object. The trick is: How does it know where to break the string up? Well, when you call the split   method, you specify a delimiter that the method will use to determine the start of each new element. For example, the following code will create an Array with “Diapers”, “Baby Wipes,” and “Rattle” as the elements.  var productList = “Diapers-Baby Wipes-Rattle”; var bpArray = productList.split  “-” ;   4804-2 Ch06.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 72  72  Saturday Morning  Putting It All Together  At this point, you’ve got all the pieces you need to really start making things hap- pen. Two files in the Session06 folder of your CD-ROM  the babyPalooza.js and index.htm files  take everything you’ve seen so far and combine it all to lay the foundation of the Baby-Palooza.com storefront. Due to the length of these files I won’t be showing them here, so load them into your editor  and your web browser  so that you can follow along.  Looking first at the babyPalooza.js file, you’ll see that I’ve reorganized all of the  store data in terms of Array objects. This will allow me to manipulate all of my product information through a single variable: productInfo.  I’ve also updated the showProductInfo function to take advantage of the fact  that it is now being passed an Array. As a result, it now pulls the product data that it displays directly out of the Array object it receives, rather than processing a bunch of parameters. As part of that process, I’ve also used a call to the split   method along with a switch statement to determine the product’s category  “Stroller,” “Rattle,” etc.  Displaying this information will give my customers a slightly better idea of what they are buying.  Tying all of this together is the index.htm file. The main difference between the  current version of this file and what you saw in Session 4 is that I no longer explicitly call showProductInfo for each product. Instead I simply loop through my productInfo array and pass each product’s information Array object to the function.  Remember, productInfo[x] actually refers to an entire subarray in my multidimensional array.   REVIEW  In this session you’ve learned about arrays, the JavaScript Array object, and all of the different operations and methods they can use. You saw how arrays can be used to hold a lot of data in a single variable while still allowing easy access to that data. You also learned how to create and use an array whose slots are named instead of numbered. You even saw a variant of the for loop that will let you work with arrays that have named slots. Finally, we looked at an example of how every- thing you’ve seen so far can be used together to lay the groundwork for a flexible Web storefront.   4804-2 Ch06.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 73  Session 6—Working with JavaScript Arrays  73  QUIZ YOURSELF  1.

Now it’s time to talk about the environment that JavaScript actually lives in. If you are thinking that means the Web browser, you are only par-  tially correct. While it’s true that the Web browser is the host for your JavaScript programs, your programs will never interact directly with the Web browser. Instead, you’ll be working with a collection of JavaScript objects that act as an intermedi- ary between your JavaScript programs and the Web browser. This collection of objects is sometimes called the Browser Object Model. The purpose of the Browser Object Model is to provide a simple, consistent interface between your JavaScript programs and the Web browser.  Why do things this way? Well, consider the personal computer industry.  Programs written for one platform  like the Macintosh  won’t run on another plat- form  like Windows  without a lot of conversion work. This is because they use very different programming interfaces to accomplish the same tasks.   4804-2 Ch07.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 76  76  Saturday Morning  Now consider the Web browser industry. The JavaScript code you create for  Internet Explorer should be able to work perfectly well on Netscape’s Navigator.  There are of course, some differences, but they are minor compared to moving software between the Mac and Windows!  You can even use the code you wrote for Navigator on Linux with Internet Explorer on the Macintosh. This is because both browsers support the same programming interface, namely, the Browser Object Model.  What’s in the Browser Object Model?  You’ve already been exposed to one part of the Browser Object Model: the docu- ment object. As you’ll remember from Session 1, the document object represents the actual HTML document that’s loaded into the Web browser. Just like the other objects you’ve looked at  the String object in Session 5 and the Array object in Session 6 , the document object has a whole host of properties and methods all its own.  In fact, the document object is so important, we’re going to discuss it in detail in Session 9 a bit later this morning.   There’s more to the Browser Object Model than just the document object. The  Browser Object Model is made up of a whole slew of objects that allow your JavaScript programs to peek and poke into just about every nook and cranny of the Web browser. All of these objects are arranged in what looks like an upside- down tree structure. The window object sits at the top of this tree and all of the other objects in the Browser Object Model can be found inside it. Figure 7-1 illus- trates the main objects found in the Browser Object Model for Netscape Navigator 6 and Internet Explorer 5  other browsers will be a bit different .   As you can see from Figure 7-1, the Browser Object Model is very big and rather complex. So, the purpose of this session is to simply get familiar with the Browser Object Model and the capabilities it offers. You’ll be learning about the individual parts of the Browser Object Model over the remainder of the weekend. In the dis- cussion that follows, I’ll give the names of the major objects in the Browser Object Model along with a brief description of each. I’ll also tell you in which session number that object is discussed.  The window object  The window object represents the Web browser window. It also encapsulates all of the other objects we’ll be talking about in the remainder of this session.  Remember the “array of arrays” from the end of Session 6? The concept behind the window object is very similar to that. Think of it as an object that contains a   4804-2 Ch07.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 77  S e s s i o n   7  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 7—Understanding the Browser Object Model  77  bunch of other objects.  Most of the objects inside the window object represent the various controls that you see in your browser window. For example, the history object  discussed in Session 27  holds the addresses of the Web pages you’ve vis- ited. Other objects and properties inside the window object include the following.  window  history  navigator  location  screen  frames  document  Each item is the frames array is a window object  forms  form  location  applets  images  anchors  embeds  plugins  styleSheets  button  radio  checkbox  documentElement  submit  hidden  password  fileupload  links  text  reset  text area  select  options  Other available objects vary with browser version  Figure 7-1 The Browser Object Model   4804-2 Ch07.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 78  78  Saturday Morning  The document object: As mentioned in Session 1, the document object repre- sents the currently loaded HTML page. There’s more information on the document object to come later in this session, and we’ll be discussing it in detail in Session 9.  The frames array: JavaScript treats each frame that appears in the browser  window as a window object all to itself. So, if your Web site uses frames, the JavaScript window object that represents the actual browser window  that is, not one of the frames  is known as the parent window. This parent will contain an Array object called the frames array. Each slot in the frames array will contain a window object corresponding to one of the frames in the Web browser. While it might sound confusing to have window objects inside window objects, it’s quite easy to work with, as you’ll see in Session 23.  The location property: This is a String object that contains the address of the Web page currently loaded into the Web browser.  The location object is discussed in Session 27.   The navigator object: This object holds details about the brand, version, and capabilities of your Web browser. In addition to this basic information, it also con- tains detailed lists of the plug-ins that are installed and the MIME types that the browser knows about. Your JavaScript program can use this information to deter- mine if a particular type of multimedia file will work in the browser.  The naviga- tor object is discussed in Session 26. Support for plug-ins and MIME types is discussed in Session 29.   At this point, an illustration might help. Figure 7-2 shows a typical browser  window, frames and all, and how the parts of the window correspond to the objects you’ve just been introduced to.  Another important aspect of the window object is the fact that it goes by sev- eral different names. Usually if you want to refer to the window object, you just use the name window. However, you don’t have to name the window object at all. If JavaScript doesn’t know which object you are talking about, it will assume that you are talking about the window object and use it by default. For example, the following two statements are equivalent:  document.write  “Howdy!” ; window.document.write  “Howdy!” ;  As mentioned earlier, when you are working with frames, the window object  representing the actual browser window can be referred to as “parent.” You can use this name even if you aren’t using frames.  Finally, you can also refer to the window object as “self” or “top.”  The name  “top” is also useful in the context of frames. We’ll talk more about that in Session 23 as well.  So, all of the following statements are equivalent.  document.write  “Howdy!” ; parent.document.write  “Howdy!” ; self.document.write  “Howdy!” ; top.document.write  “Howdy!” ;   4804-2 Ch07.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 79  Session 7—Understanding the Browser Object Model  79  The entire web browser window is represented by the window object  Location  Click here to see the history list  S e s s i o n   7  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Figure 7-2 Parts of a browser window and corresponding JavaScript objects  Document  The document object  You’ve already seen how the document object can be used to write a string out to the browser window. However, the document object can do much more than just this. The document object allows your JavaScript program to do the following.  Interact with HTML forms: This includes manipulating all of the various con-  trols available to HTML forms  text boxes, buttons, and so forth . You can even val- idate the data in a form  Session 15  and change the location that a form is submitted to. This is probably the single most useful aspect of JavaScript on the Web page, so we’re going to be looking at this in extremely fine detail in Sessions 12, 13, and 15.  Manipulate cookies: The document object gives you direct control over the cookies that are saved on the Web browser client’s machine. We’ll be looking at this in Session 16.   4804-2 Ch07.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 80  80  Saturday Morning  Interact with images: The document object allows you to directly access and manipulate the images that are loaded into your Web documents. In Session 14, we’ll see how JavaScript will let us load images and even create simple animations.  Interact with Java applets: The document object also gives you access to any  Java applets that might be loaded by your Web page. We’ll look at this in Session 30.  JavaScript and the Browser Object Model  Now that you’ve got an idea of what’s in the Browser Object Model, you might be wondering how you actually use it. I’ve already shown you a small sample of this, in the discussion of the window object. Consider again, this line of code:  window.document.write  “Howdy!” ;  What exactly is this code telling JavaScript to do? Well, remember from our dis-  cussion of String object methods that the period is an operator that tells JavaScript to look inside an object so that you can access something contained in it. So, this code says, “Look inside the window object and get me the document object. Then, look inside the document object and call its write   method.” This is how you access the parts of the Browser Object Model with JavaScript: Starting with the window object, you list the names of the objects that will lead to the object you want to access. All you have to remember is to separate the object names with periods. This list of object names will tell JavaScript the path to follow to access the Browser Object Model object you want.  A simple example  How does an HTML file map to the Browser Object Model? Here’s an example.      Browser Object Model     Welcome to Baby-Palooza!   Number of Strollers:      4804-2 Ch07.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 81  Session 7—Understanding the Browser Object Model  81  Number of Diapers:    Number of Rattles:          When the Web browser loads this file, it actually creates a complete set of Browser  Object Model objects to represent it. For this file, the following objects are created:  Object The window object  Meaning This represents the Web browser itself.  The document object  This represents the HTML file.  A form object named  “order”  Three input objects  named “strollCount,”  “diaperCount,” and  “rattleCount”  This represents the   tag defined in our HTML file.  Note that the name of this object is the same as the name you specify in the name attribute of the   tag.  If you have more than one   in your HTML file, you need only give them each a unique name attribute to access them through JavaScript.   These objects represent the text boxes defined inside the  order form. Each of these objects has a value property that holds the number that’s currently typed into the  text box. Again, the name for each of these JavaScript objects is taken directly from the name attribute used in its corresponding HTML   tag.  Of course, there are other objects created. For example, a forms array is created  as well. But, since there are no corresponding definitions in the HTML file, those objects will be empty.  In this case, the forms array will have a length of zero.  In Figure 7-3, you can see how these objects are nested one inside the other.  S e s s i o n   7  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch07.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 82  82  Saturday Morning  window object  document object  form Object "order"  input Object - "strollCount"  input Object - "diaperCount"  input Object - "rattleCount"  Figure 7-3 Objects created by our simple HTML file  Knowing all of this, you can then write code that will access these objects. For  example:  var numStrollers = document.order.strollCount.value; var numDiapers = document.order.diaperCount.value;  In each line of code, I’m “drilling down” from the outermost object  in this case, the document object, remember that the window object is implied  to the property I want to access  the value property of the individual text box objects . The first line, for example, says, “Look in the document object and you’ll find an object named order. Look inside the order object and you’ll find another object named strollCount. Look inside this object and get the contents of its value property. Finally, place that result into the numStrollers variable.” Of course, you can also assign values to these properties as well:  document.order.strollCount.value = 10; document.order.diaperCount.value = 95;  However, these are more than just simple assignment statements. Remember, these objects correspond to HTML elements that are actually on the screen while your JavaScript program is executing. So, if you assign a new value to the value property of the rattleCount text box, that number will immediately appear on screen in the text box! This is what makes the combination of JavaScript and the Browser Object Model so very powerful. By using them together, your JavaScript program can easily interact with the elements of the HTML page and dynamically change the information that the user sees.   4804-2 Ch07.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 83  Session 7—Understanding the Browser Object Model  83  REVIEW  In this session, you learned about the Browser Object Model. You learned that, as far as JavaScript is concerned, the Web browser and everything in it is just a col- lection of JavaScript objects. You also learned how to create statements to access the various parts of the Browser Object Model. Finally, you saw how interaction between your JavaScript code and the Browser Object Model can change what the user sees in the Web browser.  QUIZ YOURSELF  1. What does the window object represent?

By working through the window object, your JavaScript code can effectively control just about every aspect of the browser. As you might imagine, Session 7 only scratched the surface of what’s in the window object. In this session, we’re going to dig quite a bit deeper into the window object so you can see how to use its properties and methods in your JavaScript programs.  Examples of these properties and methods can be found on your CD-ROM in the Session08 folder.   Both Netscape and Internet Explorer have added proprietary properties and methods to the window object. So I’ll restrict myself to only those properties and methods that work in both browsers. If you need to write JavaScript that’s specific to a browser, refer to Session 26.  Note  ✔  4804-2 Ch08.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 86  86  Saturday Morning  Properties of the window Object  As you read the following descriptions, keep in mind that a window object and its properties can be assigned to a JavaScript variable just like any other object. Many of the examples in this session make use of this fact to open and track multiple windows.  The closed property  This tells you if a particular window object represents an open browser window. If the window is open, the closed property will be false. If the window is closed, it will be true.  This property specifies a string that will be displayed in the browser’s status bar.  The status bar is typically found in the lower left-hand corner of the browser window.   The defaultStatus property  The document property  This is the document object. It represents the HTML document that is currently loaded into the browser window or the HTML document that is loaded into a partic- ular frame. The document object is discussed in detail in the next session.  This array holds one window object for each frame in a multiframe Web site.  The frames array is discussed in detail in Session 23.   The frames array  The history property  The history property is an object that contains the history list — that is, a list of Web sites visited by that window object. Each window object  including those in the frames array  has its own history property.  The history object is discussed in Session 27.    4804-2 Ch08.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 87  S e s s i o n   8  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 8—Working with the window Object  87  The location property holds the Web address of the page you are currently viewing. If you assign this property a new Web address, the Web browser will load that Web page.  The location object is discussed in detail in Session 27.   The location property  The name property  This property contains the name of the window object. Note that this is not the same as the name of the JavaScript variable that actually holds the window object. For example:  var catalogWindow = window.open  ; catalogWindow.name = “catalog”;  Once you assign a name to a window object, you can use that name in the tar- get attribute of an anchor tag. So, in the following example, clicking on the “See the Catalog” link will load the catalog.htm file into the window that was opened by your JavaScript code.   See the Catalog   The navigator property  The navigator object contains information about the Web browser including its version, brand information and platform information. The following simple script will reveal everything contained in the navigator object.  We’ll discuss how to use this information to write browser-specific scripts in Session 26.   for  x in navigator    document.write  x + “ = “ + navigator[x] + “ ” ;  The opener property  When one window creates another  using the window.open   method, discussed later in this session  the first window becomes the opener of the new window. This allows you to actually communicate between windows.  We’ll look at this process in Session 24.    self.name = “original”; var newWindow = window.open  ; document.write  newWindow.opener.name ;   4804-2 Ch08.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 88  88  Saturday Morning  The parent property  If your site is arranged in frames, each frame is considered to be its own window. So, each frame has its own window object. These window objects are all “children” of the frameset document that loaded those frames into the Web browser. The win- dow object representing the frameset document is therefore said to be the parent of each frame. The parent property holds the window object representing the frame- set document. This is shown in Figure 8-1.  The source code for Figure 8-1 is in the file framesNparent.htm.   Figure 8-1 Frames and the parent property  The screen property  The screen property contains information about the screen settings on the client monitor. You can use this information to determine the resolution of the client monitor and load the appropriately sized graphics.  We’ll discuss the screen prop- erty in Session 14.   The status property  This property holds a string that will be temporarily displayed in the browser’s sta- tus bar. After a brief period, the string in the defaultStatus property will replace this message.   4804-2 Ch08.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 89  Session 8—Working with the window Object  89  The top property  The top property refers to the top-most window in a set of frames-based windows. This is essentially the window object that represents the actual Web browser win- dow. How is this different from the parent property? Consider Figure 8-2.  S e s s i o n   8  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Figure 8-2 Frames within frames and the top property  This window shows a frameset within a frameset. As you can see, the innermost set of frames  the bottom row  have a parent that is itself a frame in the browser window. In this case, the parent for these frames is not the same thing as the actual browser window. The top property, on the other hand, always represents the actual browser window.  Methods of the window Object  The window object provides several methods. In this section, we’ll look at these methods and see how they can be used to interact with the user and the web browser itself.   4804-2 Ch08.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 90  90  The alert   method  Saturday Morning  This method displays a dialog containing a message that you specify along with a single OK button. Calling this method will halt execution of your JavaScript  program until the user clicks the OK button to proceed.  Note that in the Linux version of Netscape Navigator, the alert   method does not halt execution of your program!  The alert   method is extremely useful as a debugging tool. If you need to know the value of a variable, simply slap it into an alert   call and you’ll see the value pop up on the screen in front of you. For example, if you wanted to know the value of a variable named price, you could simply code alert  price .  The blur   method  The blur   method will remove the focus from the associated window object. This means that the window object will no longer receive any keystrokes that the user types. If you call blur   for a window in a frame, the focus will go to the top object in its browser window. If you call blur   for a top level window  that is, the window that represents the browser  that window will usually be sent to the back of all other open browser windows.  The clearInterval   and clearTimeout   methods  See the discussions for the setInterval   and setTimeout   methods later in this Session.  The close   method  Calling the close   method will close the associated browser window. As a secu- rity measure, most Web browsers will only let you close the windows you create yourself. If you try to close a browser window created by the system, you’ll usually get a confirmation dialog telling you that the Web page you are viewing is trying to close the window. For example, assuming that you start Internet Explorer  for Windows  and immediately load in a file containing the following code:  var newWindow = window.open  ; newWindow.close  ; self.close  ;  The first close   call will proceed as expected. However, the second close    call will bring up a dialog asking you to confirm that you want the window to close.   4804-2 Ch08.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 91  S e s s i o n   8  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 8—Working with the window Object  91  The confirm   method  The confirm   method lets you ask the user a simple “OK” or “Cancel” question. You pass the confirm   method a string containing your question and it presents that question to the user along with a set of OK and Cancel buttons. If the user clicks the OK button, a true is returned. If the user clicks the Cancel button, a false is returned.  if  confirm “Would you like to proceed?”   {  alert “Here we go...” ; } else {  alert “I understand. These things can be scary!” ; }  The focus   method will tell the Web browser to direct keystrokes to the specified window object. If the window object specified isn’t the front-most window, the focus   method will bring that window to the front.  The focus   method  The moveBy   method  Calling this method will move the specified window by a specified number of pixels.   self.moveBy 10, 30 ; self.moveBy -10,-30 ;  The first statement will move the window 10 pixels to the right and 30 pixels down from its current position. The second statement will move the window 10 pixels up and 30 pixels to the left of its current position. Note that most browsers will not let you move the window off of the screen.  The moveTo   method  This method moves a window to an absolute position on the screen. For example:  self.moveTo 0, 0 ; self.moveTo 100,300 ;  The first statement will move the window to the upper left corner of the screen.  The second statement will move the window to a position 100 pixels from the top of the screen and 300 pixels from the left-hand side of the screen. Here again, most browsers will not let you move the window off of the screen.   4804-2 Ch08.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 92  92  The open   method  Saturday Morning  As you’ve seen in several of the other examples in this Session, the open   method opens a new browser window and returns a window object to represent it. If you call the open   method with no parameters, you will get an empty browser window. If you want something more interesting, you can pass up to four parame- ters in the following order:  url  name  featuresList  replace  This is the Web address of a Web page that you want to automatically load into the new window. This is a string that will be placed into the window.name property of the new window. This is a string specifying the features the new window should have. This parameter lets you specify how big the window should be, if it should have toolbars, scroll bars, and so on.  We’ll discuss these features in Session 24.  This is a Boolean value that specifies if the Web address specified in the first parameter should replace the current entry in the history list.  As an example, the following code would create a new window object named  “hungryMinds” which would display the Hungry Minds Web site.  var bookSite = window.open  “http:  www.hungryminds.com”, “hungryMinds” ;  The prompt   method  The prompt   method allows you to ask the user a question, and get back an answer. You pass two parameters to the prompt   method: a message string and a default response value. The following statement will present the user with the dia- log shown in Figure 8-3.  var response = prompt  “What is your favorite color?”, “black” ;  Note the default response specified in the call to prompt   is shown in the text  box. The user can type over this value, or click OK to accept it as their reply. If they click OK, the value typed into the text box will be returned to your script. If the user clicks Cancel, a special value called null is returned to your script. A null tells your program that nothing was returned by prompt  .  The null value is used in JavaScript to represent “nothing” or an empty object.  Since null is a JavaScript keyword, you can check for it like this:   4804-2 Ch08.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 93  S e s s i o n   8  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 8—Working with the window Object  93  var response = prompt  “What is your favorite color?”, “black” ; if  response == null  {  alert  “You clicked the Cancel button” ; } else {  alert  “Your response was “ + response ; }  Figure 8-3 A dialog created by the prompt   method  The resizeTo   method  This method will resize a browser window to the width and height specified.  self.resizeTo 50, 325 ;    Set width to 50 and height to 325  Note that the size you specify represents the entire browser window  including  toolbars, buttons, and so forth  not just the document portion of the window!  The scroll   and scrollTo   methods  Each of these methods will let you scroll the content of a window to a specified point. The point specified will appear in the upper left-hand corner of the window.  scroll  0, 0 ; scrollTo  0, 30 ;  The first statement will scroll to the top of a document while the second state-  ment will scroll 30 pixels down the document.  The scrollBy   method  The scrollBy   method will scroll a document a specified number of pixels from its current position. The following statement will scroll a document up 25 pixels.  scrollBy  0, -25 ;   4804-2 Ch08.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 94  94  Saturday Morning  The setInterval   and clearInterval   methods  The setInterval   method is almost exactly like the setTimeout   method.  In fact, you should read the description of the setTimeout   method before continu- ing here.  The main difference is that the JavaScript statement you pass to setInterval   is executed over and over again. After each execution, the timer resets and the countdown begins again. So, this statement will scroll down a docu- ment, 100 pixels at a time, every two seconds.  var intervalID = setInterval  ‘scrollBy  0, 100 ;’, 2000 ;  The only ways to stop this process is to either close the browser window or to  use the clearInterval   method to stop the timer from counting down.  clearInterval  intervalID ;  The setTimeout   and clearTimeout   methods  This method is one of the most useful, and confusing, methods in the window object. The setTimeout   method takes two parameters: The first is a string that represents a valid JavaScript statement. The second is a number representing a time period expressed in milliseconds.  A millisecond is 1 1000th of a second. So, 1000 milliseconds is 1 second.   The setTimeout   method takes the first parameter and sets it aside in a spe- cial queue. It then takes the second parameter and uses it to start a countdown. For example, if you pass 2000 milliseconds for the second parameter, you’ll get a two-second countdown.  Once the countdown is finished, the first parameter is retrieved and passed to  the JavaScript interpreter. The JavaScript interpreter then executes the statement in the string just as if you had typed it directly into your source code.  In this example, the setTimeout   method will set up a five-second counter.  When this expires  that is, when it times out  the statement alert ‘Hello World!’  will be executed.  setTimeout  “alert ‘Hello World!’ ”, 5000 ;  Notice that the string we are passing is a valid JavaScript statement. Also note  how I’ve nested my quotes in this example. If I had written the statement this way:  setTimeout  “alert “Hello World!” ”, 5000 ;   4804-2 Ch08.F  4 9 01  8:14 AM  Page 95  S e s s i o n   8  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 8—Working with the window Object  95  The statement would have failed because you can’t have two sets of the same type of quotes in a single string.  Another thing to note is that the setTimeout   method does not set up a  recursive call to the statement you specify in the first parameter. The JavaScript statement in the first parameter is only executed once, and only after the speci- fied number of milliseconds has passed. To execute a statement over and over again, use the setInterval   method instead.  It’s not shown in any of these examples, but the setTimeout   method also returns a result. This result is a timer ID that you can either hold onto or ignore completely. If you decide to hold onto it, you can pass this timer ID to the clearTimeout   method and the timer will be stopped and the associated JavaScript statement will not be executed.  The setTimeout   method is an extremely powerful and important part of the  window object. In fact, it’s so useful, you’ll find it used in a large number of the sample files for this session.  We’ll be talking more about the setTimeout   method and its close cousin, the eval   function, in Session 20.   Never  You should never write a recursive function in JavaScript! If you do, you’ll quickly generate an error message to the effect that the JavaScript interpreter has run out of memory. In a worst-case scenario, you can even crash the browser! Instead, always use the setInterval   or setTimeout   methods to set up a repeating function or code block.  For an example of a recursive function, see the recurseBad.htm file in the Session08 folder. Just be sure to save all of your work before you load this file!   It’s been another information-packed session, but the result is that you now know just about everything there is to know about the window object. You’ve learned about the properties and methods that make up the window object, and, if you’ve loaded any of the source files on the CD-ROM, you’ve seen how to use them.  REVIEW  QUIZ YOURSELF  1.

As with the other objects you’ve seen, the document object contains a whole host of properties and methods that let you investigate and manipulate the HTML page. In this session, we’ll look at these properties and methods to see how you can use them from JavaScript.  Examples showing the use of each property and method can be found on your CD-ROM in the Session09 folder.   As with the window object, each of the major Web browsers defines several proprietary properties and methods for the docu- ment object. Again, I’ll be restricting my discussion to those items that should work in the latest versions of Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.  Note  ✔  4804-2 Ch09.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 98  98  Saturday Morning  Properties of the document Object  In the sections that follow, you’ll see how the properties of the document object can be used to affect the way your HTML documents are seen by your users.   The alinkColor property  The alinkColor property specifies the color that should be used to display the currently active link. The currently active link is the link that will be followed if you press the return key or click the mouse on it. To change this, just assign it a new color value:  document.alinkColor = “gray”;  If you need a bit more control over the color you want to use, you can also  assign a hexadecimal color value. Note however that these hex values need to be preceded with a pound sign and not the 0x that you would use when assigning a hexadecimal value to a JavaScript variable. So, an equivalent statement using a hex value would look like this:  document.alinkColor = “808080”;  When you assign a color this way, you are specifying the red, green, and blue   RGB  color values that will be mixed to create the final color. In the above exam- ple, all three colors are being assigned a value of 0x80  128 decimal . In the fol- lowing example:  document.alinkColor = “00FF77”;  The value for red is 0x00  zero, the lowest possible value , the value for green is  0xFF  which is 255 decimal and is the highest possible value  and the value for blue is 0x77  which is 119 decimal . These values will be mixed to arrive at the final display color.  However, if you don’t want to muck about with numbers, there are several stan-  dardized color values that have been assigned names that you can use for your colors. Table 9-1 shows the standard color names  and their equivalent hexadecimal values  that you can use for this and the other color-related properties of the doc- ument object.   4804-2 Ch09.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 99  S e s s i o n   9  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 9—Working with the document Object  99  Table 9-1 Standard Color Names and Numbers  Color Name  Color Name  Hexadecimal  Color Number  RRGGBB  00FFFF  000000  0000FF  FF00FF  808080  008000  00FF00  800000  navy  olive  purple  red  silver  teal  white  yellow  Hexadecimal  Color Number  RRGGBB  000080  808000  800080  FF0000  C0C0C0  008080  FFFFFF  FFFF00  aqua  black  blue  fuchsia  gray  green  lime  maroon  The anchors array  The anchors array holds one Anchor object for each set of <a name=”someName”>  tags that are in the document. Each Anchor object has a name property that contains the name specified in the name attribute of the HTML anchor tag. So, the following HTML   This is the top     This is the bottom   would create an anchors array with two Anchor objects in it. The first anchor object would have a name property of “top” and the second would have a name of “bottom.”  The applets array  The applets array holds all of the Java applets that are embedded in the HTML document.  Each item in this array corresponds to an   tag in the HTML document.  The properties and methods that you can access for these Java applets   4804-2 Ch09.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 100  100  Saturday Morning  will be the same as the properties and methods that each applet makes available to the outside world. We’ll be discussing the relationship between Java and JavaScript in more detail in Session 30.  The bgColor property  This property lets you set the background color of the HTML document.   document.bgColor = “red”;  Note that in Netscape Navigator, you can only assign a value to bgColor at the  start of your HTML document  that is, in a script block located between the    tags.  In Internet Explorer however, you can assign a value to this property at any time. This will result in an immediate change of the background color in your document.  The cookie property  The cookie property lets you read and set the client’s cookie value for an HTML document. Reading and writing a cookie is very simple:  var theCookie = document.cookie;    read the cookie document.cookie = theCookie;    write the cookie  However, as you’ll see in Session 16, actually using a cookie is a bit more complex.   The domain property  This property contains the host name of the Web server that the HTML document was loaded from.  If the document was loaded from a local file, this property will contain the empty string.  As I’ve hinted at previously, JavaScript code in one browser window can communicate with JavaScript in another window. However, this is allowed only if the document.domain property is the same for each window that wants to communicate. So, if the two HTML files you want to communicate come from two different servers on your site  that is, two different domains , this can present a problem. In Session 24, I’ll show you how to use the document.domain property to work around this restriction.   4804-2 Ch09.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 101  Session 9—Working with the document Object  101  The embeds array  The embeds array contains one entry for each of the   tags in the HTML document. If an individual embedded item has a Java-style interface, you can interact with it in the same way that you would a Java applet in the applets array. However, this is entirely dependent on the embedded item.  The fgColor property  This property lets you change the foreground color of the HTML document.   document.fgColor = “blue”;   Unlike the bgColor property, only older versions of Netscape Navigator restrict the use of this property to the start of an HTML document. In Navigator v6 and later, you can assign a value to fgColor whenever you like.   The forms array  The forms array contains one form object for each set of    tags in the HTML document. These form objects themselves contain objects representing the various controls  text boxes, select menus, etc.  that the user interacts with in the form. The form object and its contents are one of the most important and use- ful parts of the document object, so I’ll be going over them in great detail in Sessions 12, 13, and 15.  The images array  The images array contains one entry for each   tag in the HTML document. Each entry is a JavaScript Image object that you can use to load new images or create simple animations. You’ll find information on the images array and how to use it in Session 14.  The lastModified property  This is a String object containing the date that the HTML file was last changed on disk.  S e s s i o n   9  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch09.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 102  102  Saturday Morning  The linkColor property  This property holds the color that will be used to display links  <a href=” somedestination”>  tags  in the document. As with the fgColor property, older versions of Netscape Navigator restrict the use of this property to the start of an HTML document. In the latest browsers, you can assign a value to linkColor whenever you like.   The links array  This holds a Link object for each    tag in the HTML file.  The Link object A JavaScript Link object contains lots of different properties that can provide you with a ton of information about the HTML link it represents. This information can be used to write all sorts of interesting scripts.  The linksArray.htm file on your CD-ROM shows one use for this information.  The properties of the Link object vary from browser to browser, but the most common  and useful  are described in the following sections.  The Link.hash property This contains a String object containing the hash part of the Web address specified in the link. For example, in this link, the hash portion is top.   Baby- Palooza   The Link.host property This contains a String object containing the host informa- tion from the link’s Web address. For example, in this link, the host portion is www.baby-palooza.com:80.   Baby-Palooza   The Link.hostname property This contains a String object containing just the host name information from the link’s Web address. For example, in this link, the host- name portion is www.baby-palooza.com.   Baby-Palooza    4804-2 Ch09.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 103  S e s s i o n   9  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 9—Working with the document Object  103  The Link.href property This String object contains the entire Web address specified in the link. For example, in this link, the href portion is http:  www.baby-palooza. com .   Baby-Palooza   The Link.pathname property If the Web address points to a file that’s buried in a folder somewhere on the server, this property will contain the path to that file. In this link, the pathname property would contain the string strollers index.htm.  <a href=”http:  www.baby- palooza.com strollers index.htm”>Strollers   The Link.port property This is a String object containing the port specified in the link’s Web address.   Baby-Palooza!   Here, the port property would contain the value 80.  The Link.protocol property The protocol  http, ftp, etc.  specified in the link’s Web address.  The Link.search property This is the query string specified in the Web address.  <a href=”http:  www.baby- palooza.com search.htm?type=stroller”>Show Strollers   In this example, the search property would contain the string ?type=stroller.  Note that the question mark is included at the start of the string.  The Link.target property This is a String object containing the name of the target window that is specified in the link. In the following link, the target property will contain the string goodBooks.   Hungry Minds   The Link.innerHTML Property This property is available in Netscape Navigator v6 and Internet Explorer v5 and later. Basically, it’s the text that shows up in the Web browser for a particular link. For example, in this link, the string “Hungry Minds” will be in the innerHTML property.   4804-2 Ch09.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 104  104  Saturday Morning   Hungry Minds   The really neat thing about this property is that you can actually assign a new string to it, and change the link’s text on the screen!  The location property  This holds the Web address the HTML document was loaded from. Assigning a new Web address to location will force the browser to load the page stored at that address.  document.location = “http:  www.hungryminds.com”;  The plugins array  This is another name for the embeds array. Netscape Navigator 6 doesn’t support this property, probably to avoid confusion with the navigator.plugins array  which you’ll be learning about in Session 29 . The navigator.plugins array holds information about extensions installed in the browser itself, while the plug- ins array  and the embeds array  holds information about the items embedded in an individual HTML document.  Even though only Internet Explorer supports this property, I mention it here to draw the distinction between the plugins array and the navigator.plugins array.   The referrer property  The referrer property is a String object that holds the Web address of the docu- ment from which the current HTML document was reached.  Note that this prop- erty is in the latest versions of Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, but does not seem to work .   The title property  This property holds a String containing the title of the HTML document. This is the title that is specified between the    tags.  In Internet Explorer v5+ and Netscape Navigator v6, you can assign this a new string and the title of the window will change.    4804-2 Ch09.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 105  S e s s i o n   9  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 9—Working with the document Object  105  The URL property  This property contains the same information as the location property. The main difference is that, in Netscape Navigator, assigning a new Web address to the URL property has no effect.  In Internet Explorer, assigning a new address to the URL property will force the browser to load that page.   The vlinkColor property  This property specifies the color to be used to display the links that have been visited.   Methods of the document Object  In addition to the properties discussed in the previous sections, the document object also contains several methods that allow you to manipulate the actual body of the document.  The clear   method  In the past, the clear   method was used to clear the contents of a browser win- dow. Now however, the clear   method doesn’t really do much of anything. In fact, the clear   method will be removed from JavaScript in the near future. So, why mention it? Well, there’s a lot of JavaScript out there that uses the clear   method, so I thought you should know about it. However, don’t use the clear   method in your own JavaScript code!  The open   and close   methods  When you use the write   or writeln   method to write a string to the docu- ment object, you are actually sending data to something called a stream. A stream is really just a holding place for data. The data sits in the stream until the browser is ready for it. In this case, your string data sits in the stream until the browser can write it out to the browser window. The act of preparing a stream for use is called opening the stream. Conversely, when you finish using a stream, you should close it. That’s what these methods do.  The open   method tells the browser that you want to write some new string data to the current document object. The close   method tells the browser that   4804-2 Ch09.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 106  106  Saturday Morning  you have finished writing your data. It also forces the browser to output any data that’s left in the stream.  Normally, you don’t have to bother with either method. When the browser loads  an HTML file, it automatically opens an output stream and begins filling it with the contents of the HTML file along with the output of any document.write   or document.writeln   calls you make in your JavaScript code. Then, when the HTML file is completely loaded  and your JavaScript code has finished creating its output , the browser will close the stream and display the page. However, if you want to send any text to the browser window, after the HTML page is loaded, you need to proceed in the following manner:   1. Call document.open  . This will open the document object for writing  once again.  2. Make your document.write   or document.writeln   calls. This will let  you write out whatever HTML or plain text you wish.  3. Call document.close  . This tells the browser that you are finished writ- ing your output to the browser window. In response, it will close the out- put stream and write any characters left in the stream to the browser window.  As you might guess, this combination of calls will actually let you create your  own HTML pages on the fly. While this is a very powerful feature of JavaScript, there is one side effect of the open   method that you need to be aware of: When you call the open   method, the contents of the document are cleared from the browser window.  This is why the clear   method is no longer used. The open   method does exactly the same thing.  Then whatever you write to the browser window will actually replace the old contents of the browser window as soon as the close   method is called! Consider the following:       The document Object: the open   and close   Methods    function writeNewStuff   {  document.open  ; for  x=0; x<5; x++  {  document.close  ; }  document.write  “Oh dear! I seem to have overwritten everything! ” ; }   4804-2 Ch09.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 107  S e s s i o n   9  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 9—Working with the document Object  107          for  x=0; x<5; x++  {  document.write  “Shop at Baby-Palooza! ” ; }  setTimeout  ‘writeNewStuff  ’, 5000 ;        Here, the code at the bottom of the file writes out five lines of propaganda and  then sets up a timer that will call the writeNewStuff   function five seconds later. When this function executes, it calls the open   method and then writes out five more lines of text. Finally, it calls close   to send that text to the browser window. If you load this file into a browser, you’ll see the initial text on screen for a few seconds and then it will suddenly be replaced by the output of the writeNewStuff   function. If you then view the source of the browser window, you’ll find the original contents of the HTML document are gone, including your JavaScript code!  The moral of this story is that it’s a very bad idea to call the open   and close   methods for the document that your code resides in. As we’ll see in Session 23, a better approach is to have your JavaScript code in a control frame and your content in another display frame. This way, your JavaScript code can use the open  , write   and close   methods to change the contents in your display frame while your JavaScript code remains untouched.  The write   method  At this point, you should be very familiar with what the write   method does. It simply writes out a string to the browser window. That string can contain any printable character, even characters that comprise HTML tags. We’ll discuss this more in Session 11.  The writeln   method  The writeln   method is just like the write   method, with one addition. At the end of the string you specify, it adds a new line character. While this doesn’t appear in your final HTML output, it will help format the underlying HTML code by   4804-2 Ch09.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 108  108  Saturday Morning  placing a new line at the end of each line of output  this causes subsequent lines of output to start on the next line .  REVIEW  In this session, you learned about the properties and methods of the document object. First, you saw how to use the properties to examine and change character- istics of the currently loaded HTML document. Then, you saw how to use the doc- ument.open  , document.write  , and document.close   methods to create new contents for the browser window.  QUIZ YOURSELF  1. What is the document object?

However, almost everything I’ve shown you thus far has required  you, the programmer, to take the initiative in making things happen. In this ses- sion, you’re going to learn how to write JavaScript code that actually waits for things to happen and then reacts accordingly.  What Are “Events?”  To paraphrase a popular colloquialism, “stuff happens.” This is true not only in life, but in the Web browser as well. When something interesting happens in the Web browser, it’s called an event. For example, when the user clicks the mouse on a button in a form, that’s an event. However, events aren’t just created by the user.  ✔ ✔  4804-2 Ch10.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 110  110  Saturday Morning  When the browser finishes loading a Web page, that’s an event too. In fact, in the Web browser environment, there are over a dozen different types of events that can occur. There are events that tell you when keys have been pressed, when a form has been submitted and even when the contents of a text box have changed! The point of this is that an event exists to represent just about everything that can occur in the Web browser. For example, each and every HTML control you cre- ate will generate its own set of events. Because of this, you can write JavaScript code to respond to each control’s events individually. This gives you an incredible amount of control over the behavior of your Web pages.  Responding to an event is called handling the event, and the JavaScript code you write to handle an event is called an event handler. So, for example, you can write one event handler that’s called when your HTML document finishes loading, and another that’s called when a new item is chosen from a select menu in one of your forms. Of course, you don’t have to create event handlers for every event, but if you really need to, you can.  Creating Event Handlers  An event handler usually takes the form of a JavaScript function that you create specifically to handle a certain type of event. An event handler can also be one or more JavaScript statements that are embedded in the HTML that defines the event.  The first step in creating an event handler is to actually define the event you  want to handle. Event definitions always begin with the letters on and are usually defined as part of an HTML tag. For example, a load event occurs when the Web browser finishes loading an HTML document. So, this event will be defined as an onload event for the body of the document. So, the onload event is defined as part of the   tag, like so:     Here I have the name of my event  onload  followed by an equal sign. After  that, in quotes, I have the JavaScript statement I want to execute in response to the event. Almost all event definitions follow this same basic format.  The question now is, “What exactly does this do?” Well, the onload event for an HTML document occurs after the last character of that document is loaded into the Web browser. So, as soon as the Web browser has loaded the last character of the HTML file, it looks to see if I have defined an onload event handler in the   tag. I have, so at that point it actually executes the JavaScript statement that is in quotes after the equal sign. The end result is that after the page loads, an alert window will appear to welcome the user to the Baby-Palooza.com site.   4804-2 Ch10.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 111  S e s s i o n   1 0  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 10—Reacting to Events  111  The act of triggering an event is sometimes referred to as firing the event. So, you might hear someone say something like, “When the onload handler fires, you’ll be directed to a new Web site.”  Event handlers can be more that just one JavaScript statement. So, this is per-  Note  fectly legal:    var pageLoaded = false;      This event handler consists of a call to the alert   method, followed by an  assignment statement.  Remember, as shown in Session 2, you can have multiple JavaScript statements on a single line, just separate them with a semicolon.  There are just two statements in this handler, but it could just as easily contain three statements or a dozen.  Another important point to notice in this example is that the code in my event  handler has full access to my global variables  in this case, the pageLoaded vari- able . Remember, JavaScript global variables are accessible everywhere, including inside event handlers.  Of course, if your event handler needs to do something complex, you’ll probably  want to place it in a function. As you might expect, that would look something like this:    var pageLoaded = false; function doLoad  isLoaded  {  pageLoaded = isLoaded; alert  ‘Welcome!’ ; }       In this case, I’ve simply defined a function  doLoad    to handle the event. So,  my event handler simply calls the function. To prove that this is the same as any other function call, I’ve even passed it a parameter  true .  You don’t have to pass a parameter if your function doesn’t require one.  It should be noted that there’s no magic in the name I’ve given this function. You can give your event handling functions whatever names you wish  as long as those names are valid JavaScript function names . I’ve simply gotten into the habit of naming all of my event han- dling functions “doEventName  ”. This really helps me identify my event handling functions when I’m looking through my code.   4804-2 Ch10.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 112  112  Saturday Morning  Events You Can Handle  Now that you know how events work in general, it’s time to learn about the different events there are and how you can actually handle them with JavaScript. As with the window and document objects, each of the major browsers defines several proprietary events that the other browser simply doesn’t support. So, here again, I’ll restrict the discussion to those events supported in the latest versions of the major browsers. Another important point is that most events can be fired by lots of different  objects in the Browser Object Model. For example, not only can you define an onload event for the   tag, you can also define one for every   tag in your HTML document  as you’ll see in Session 14 . So, as you look over the follow- ing descriptions, remember that, unless explicitly stated otherwise, any given event will probably work for most HTML tags.  The trick is to experiment and see which events a given tag will support.    Finally, in the list of events that follows, I’m going to refer to each event as  you’d actually see it in a JavaScript program. For example, instead of talking about the “load” event, I’ll simply refer to it as the “onload” event.  Note that the follow- ing discussion covers the available events in a fairly generic fashion. While there are examples of how to use each event on your CD-ROM in the Session10 folder, more detailed examples of how to use each event can be found in later sessions.   The onabort event  This event is unique to the JavaScript Image object. It fires when the user aborts the loading of an image. In other words, if an image has not finished loading and the user clicks the browser’s Stop button, each unloaded image will fire off an onabort event.       Assuming these images are in the same document, clicking the Stop button  before either has loaded will cause both alert windows to display.  However, if one image has finished loading before the Stop button is clicked, only the unfinished image’s onabort handler will fire off.  We’ll be discussing the Image object and its related events in Session 14.  The onblur event  In the world of programming, the term blur is used to indicate that an object on the screen has had the user’s attention shifted away from it. When a window gets   4804-2 Ch10.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 113  S e s s i o n   1 0  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 10—Reacting to Events  113  blurred, that usually means that the window has been sent behind all of the other windows that are on the screen. Coding an onblur handler for a window is actually fairly simple. You simply define your handler in either the   or   tag that is loaded into the window. For example:     For the controls in a form, getting blurred means that the user’s keystrokes no  longer go into a particular control. For example, consider the following form:        <input type=”text” name=”fname” onblur=”alert ‘Enter your last name’ ”  > <input type=”text” name=”lname” onblur=”alert ‘Thanks!’ ”  >  Here I have two text fields. When I’m typing in the first field, it’s said to have  the focus.  See the discussion of the onfocus event later in this session.  This sim- ply means that any keys I press will be sent to this control. If I press the tab key to move to the next field  or if I click the mouse in the second field to select it , the focus will shift to the second field and first field will fire an onblur event. It’s important to note here that the onblur event can be fired for just about any con- trol that you can put into a form, not just for text boxes.  The onchange event  The onchange event can be fired by any control in a form. However, it will only fire when the contents or selected value of the control actually changes and the control becomes blurred. If the contents don’t change or the control doesn’t become blurred, the onchange event will not fire. See the onchangeEvent.htm file for a detailed example.  The onclick and ondblclick events  These events will fire in response to a click or double-click on the HTML element in which the event is defined. This is normally used to assign some sort of action to a button in a form, like so:      4804-2 Ch10.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 114  114  Saturday Morning  However, this can also be used with just about any nonempty tag  that is, any  tag that has an opening and closing tag  to make a block of text clickable. For example:   You can...   For other bizarre permutations of this concept, see the anyTagCanHaveEvents.htm  file on your CD-ROM. Also, see “The Anchor Tag’s Nonevent” at the end of this session for information on how to use the onclick event with your    tags.  The onerror event  There are two uses for the onerror event: telling when an image has not been loaded properly and handling JavaScript errors in a particular window.  Trapping image errors For images, the onerror event fires if an image fails to load due to an error. For example, if an image doesn’t exist, an onerror event will fire for that   tag.     Trapping JavaScript errors As you’ve probably noticed by now, when an error occurs in your JavaScript pro- gram  for example, if you try to execute a document.writ   call , the type of error report you get depends on which browser you are using. In Internet Explorer, you’ll get a dialog telling you what the error was, while Netscape Navigator will simply halt the execution of your script and won’t do much beyond that.  To get actual JavaScript error information from the most current versions of Netscape, you have to type javascript:  into the address box and press the return key.  If you would like your error reporting to be a bit more consistent, you can define your own JavaScript interpreter error handling function. Then, when an error occurs in your program, your function will be called to handle the error.  Unfortunately, defining such an error handler is a bit different than what we’ve  seen so far, but it’s still pretty simple to do. You simply assign the name of your error handling function to the onerror property of the window object, like so:  window.onerror = doWindowError;   4804-2 Ch10.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 115  S e s s i o n   1 0  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 10—Reacting to Events  115  Then, you simply define your error handling function as you would any other  function. The only difference is that this function must accept three parameters: a message string that details what the error was, the Web address of the file that caused the error, and the line number where the error occurred. A simple example might look like this:  function doWindowError  msg, url, line  {     Handle the error any way you want here return true; }  window.onerror = doWindowError;  Note that, at the end of my error handling function, I return a true to the JavaScript interpreter. This tells the interpreter that I handled the error myself and that it shouldn’t process it any further. Of course, if you return a false, the JavaScript interpreter will go ahead and do whatever else it thinks is necessary to handle the error.  The onfocus event  This is the counterpart to the onblur event. When a window comes to the front, or a control becomes the target of a user’s keystrokes, it is said to have gained the focus. The onfocus event allows you to respond to this occurrence.  The onkeydown, onkeypress, and onkeyup events  These events allow you to detect when a key has been pressed inside a control. We’ll discuss these events in more detail in Session 25.  The onload event  This event fires in two different instances: when an HTML document finishes load- ing and when an image finishes loading.  Trapping HTML document loads To define an onload handler for an HTML document, just define it in the   tag.      4804-2 Ch10.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 116  116  Saturday Morning  Then, when the last character of the HTML document has been loaded by the browser, the onload event handler will execute.  It’s important to realize that, for a complex HTML document, one with lots of  forms and other elements, having a document’s last character loaded by the browser may not be the same as having the document ready to use. Before a docu- ment is ready to use, its contents must be parsed by the JavaScript interpreter to create all of the Browser Object Model objects needed to properly represent the contents of the document. For example, if there are five forms in a document, all five corresponding form objects might not exist when the onload handler fires. This can cause big trouble if you try to use a not-yet-existent element from your onload handler. We’ll see how to solve this problem in Session 24.  Trapping image loads When used with   tags, this event can tell your JavaScript program when an image has finished loading.  In Session 14, you’ll see how this is used to create animations.      The onmousedown event  The onmousemove event  The onmouseout event  The onmouseover event  This is similar to the onclick event. It fires when the mouse is clicked inside an element.  This event tells you when the mouse has been moved inside an element.  This event is triggered when the mouse leaves an element. Typically, you use this event to undo whatever you might have done in response to an onmouseover event.  This event fires when the mouse moves over an element. You can define this event for almost any nonempty HTML tag. Typically, it’s used to change the window’s sta- tus line when the mouse passes over a link. Like so:   4804-2 Ch10.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 117  S e s s i o n   1 0  P a r t   I I  —  S a t u r d a y   M o r n i n g  Session 10—Reacting to Events  117  <a href= “http:  www.baby-palooza.com” onmouseover=”window.status=’Visit baby-palooza.com!’; return true”>Baby-Palooza.com   When the mouse passes over this link, the status bar at the bottom of the win- dow will change to contain the message “Visit baby-palooza.com!”  Note that after changing the window.status property, my event handler returns a true value. This is required when changing the window.status property from inside an event handler.   In contrast to the onclick and onmousedown events that tell you when an ele- ment has been clicked, this event tells you when the mouse button has been released in an element.  The onmouseup event  The onreset event  This event only fires in response to a click on a form’s Reset button. For example:         Notice that I’m defining the onreset event in the   tag and that I’m  using a return keyword as part of the event handler. The return keyword actually returns the Boolean result of the event handler to the JavaScript interpreter. If that value is true, the JavaScript interpreter will pass the reset event on to the browser, which will then reset the form to its original state. However, if that returned value is false, the JavaScript interpreter will tell the browser not to bother with resetting the form. This means that your onreset handler can set the form to whatever state it wishes, regardless of the original state of the form.  The onresize event  This event fires when the user resizes the browser or frame that the HTML docu- ment is in. You define it as part of the   tag, like so:      4804-2 Ch10.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 118  118  The onsubmit event  Saturday Morning  This is another event that belongs to forms. It fires when the user clicks a form’s Submit button. It’s defined similarly to the onreset event.         Like the onreset event, this event handler returns its result to the JavaScript  interpreter. If that value is true, it tells JavaScript to go ahead and let the browser submit the form and its data. If the value returned is false, the JavaScript interpreter will not allow the browser to submit the form. This allows your onsubmit handler to actually validate the data in the form before the browser submits it. If the data is good, you return a true and the form goes on its merry way. If the data is bad, you return a false, and you can then force the user to correct the data and try again. Of course, what constitutes good and bad data is totally up to you.  In Session 15, we’ll take a look at different data validation techniques.   The onunload event  This event fires when an HTML document is being removed from the browser win- dow. This can happen when the user clicks a link to go to another HTML document or when the browser window is being closed. You specify an onunload handler in the   tag.     Receiving this event is a good indication that it’s time for your JavaScript pro- gram to do any cleaning up that might be necessary. As you’ll see in Session 16, it’s a great time to save out the information I need to preserve the contents of my shopping cart.  The Anchor Tag’s Nonevent  While all of the above events can make your Web site more interactive, what about intercepting a simple click on a regular link? Actually, there are a couple of very interesting ways that you can use JavaScript to enhance the behavior of links.   4804-2 Ch10.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 119  Session 10—Reacting to Events  119  First, you can execute one or more JavaScript statements instead of jumping to  another HTML page. Consider the following example:   Click here to do something   In this example, I’ve replaced the normal Web address in the href attribute  with a JavaScript statement. Notice however that, unlike a standard event handler, I’ve started my statement with javascript:. This tells the HTML interpreter that what follows is a JavaScript statement, and not a standard Web address.  Another thing you can do is to combine a Web address with an onclick event  handler.  <a href=”http:  www.hungryminds.com” onclick=”alert ‘This handler will return false’ ; return false”>This link goes nowhere. . .   Here I’ve added an onclick handler that first displays an alert window and then returns a false. Because this onclick handler returns false, the link specified in the href attribute will not be followed when the user clicks on this link. On the other hand, this link  <a href=”http:  www.hungryminds.com” onclick=”alert ‘This handler will return true’ ; return true”>This link works as expected   will display the alert window and then the link specified in the href attribute will be followed, just as you would expect it to. So, by combining an anchor tag with an onclick handler you can create links that only work when a specific condition has been met.  REVIEW  In this session, you learned how to write JavaScript that responds to events. You learned what events are available in the Web browser environment and what each signifies. You also saw how to create individual event handlers for each and every event that you want to react to. Finally, you learned how to use an onclick event handler to create hyperlinks that are followed conditionally, based on the Boolean result of the onclick handler.

In fact, JavaScript can do much more than just enhance a Web page; it can actually be used to create a Web page from  scratch. For example, you’ve already seen  in Sessions 4 and 6 , how the docu- ment.write   method could be used to write out the HTML tags needed to create a table. However, you aren’t restricted to just creating tables. You can use JavaScript to dynamically build and output just about any HTML tag that you want. For example, you can create forms, image tags, headings, and even blocks of additional JavaScript code — all from within your JavaScript program.  ✔  4804-2 Ch11.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 126  126  Saturday Afternoon  Not Dynamic HTML  It’s extremely important to note that what I’m talking about here is “dynamically created HTML,” not Dynamic HTML  also known as “DHTML” . What’s the difference?  Dynamically created HTML is HTML that is created and output by your JavaScript code as your HTML document is loading. In other words, you are using JavaScript to actually create the HTML that defines what the Web page initially looks like.  Dynamic HTML is a combination of JavaScript and the Browser Object Model that allows your JavaScript program to manipulate the appearance and properties of the HTML that is already loaded into the browser. You’ll be learning about Dynamic HTML in Session 22.  Dynamically Creating HTML  As you saw in Session 9, when the browser begins to load an HTML document, it essentially makes a call to the document.open   method and then begins to parse the HTML code in the document. As it parses the HTML, it sends any output that’s generated to the browser window for the user to see. During this process, if any document.write   calls are made, the output of those calls is sent to the HTML parser and processed accordingly. The key phrase here is “processed accordingly.” If the output of a document.write   call contains one or more HTML tags, those tags will be rendered by the HTML parser and the result sent to the browser win- dow, just as if the tags had been hard-coded in the original HTML file. So, the fol- lowing JavaScript statement:  document.write “ This is bold text! ” ;  has the same overall effect as the following line of HTML:   This is bold text!   The important thing to realize here is that, as far as the HTML parser is con-  cerned, these are both just streams of characters to be parsed. Consider the follow- ing combination of JavaScript and HTML.   4804-2 Ch11.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 127  Session 11—Dynamically Creating an HTML Page  127    document.write “ This is bold text!” ;      Here, my opening boldface tag is generated by the call to document.write   and my closing boldface tag is a part of the enclosing HTML document. However, all the HTML parser sees is a stream of characters to process. This continues until every bit of HTML in the document  including any JavaScript-generated HTML  has been processed. At this point, the browser closes the document and the page is displayed in the browser. After the document is closed, there are only two ways to change the contents of the window:  cid:2  Use document.open   to reopen the document. This would be followed by  the document.write   calls needed to output the desired HTML. After everything was output, you would then call document.close   to tell the browser to display the new contents. As we saw in Session 9, the drawback to this approach is that this combination of calls will actually erase the current contents of the window.   cid:2  The only other option is to use Dynamic HTML  DHTML  to modify the  structure of the HTML document. We’ll discuss this in detail in Session 22.  The point here is that if you want to dynamically generate the contents of your HTML page, the best time to do so is while the page is being loaded.  HTML == JavaScript string  The key to dynamically creating HTML is to realize that, as far as the browser is concerned, an HTML document is just a stream of characters. In terms of JavaScript, this means that the HTML you’ll be creating can be thought of as one or more strings. This means that you can manipulate the HTML you want to output just as easily as you can manipulate any other JavaScript variable.  Storing HTML tags in string variables The simplest, yet most powerful, trick to creating HTML with JavaScript is placing HTML tags in string variables. For example, in Session 6, I showed you a function, showProductInfo  , that created a table row by using a series of document.write   calls. That section of the function looked like this:  document.write  “ ” ; document.write  “ ” + category + “ ” ;  S e s s i o n   1 1  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch11.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 128  128  Saturday Afternoon  document.write  “ ” + pInfo[2] + “ ” ; document.write  “ ” + pInfo[1] + “ ” ; document.write  “ $” + calcFinalCost  pInfo[0], pInfo[3]  + “ ” ; document.write  “ ” ;  Here I have the strings “ ”, “ ”, “ ”, and “ ” repeated over  and over again. However, if I use a few variables to hold these strings, my code might look like this:  var tag_tr = “ ”; var tag_tr_end = “ ”; var tag_td = “ ”; var tag_td_end = “ ”; document.write  tag_tr ; document.write  tag_td + category + tag_td_end ; document.write  tag_td + pInfo[2] + tag_td_end ; document.write  tag_td + pInfo[1] + tag_td_end ; document.write  tag_td + “$” + calcFinalCost  pInfo[0], pInfo[3]  + tag_td_end ; document.write  tag_tr_end ;  Of course, this change hasn’t really saved any keystrokes. In fact, my code has actually gotten larger. However, this isn’t about saving space: it’s about flexibility. Assuming that the variables I’ve just defined are still hanging around, consider the following code:  var tableRow = tag_tr; tableRow += tag_td + category + tag_td_end; tableRow += tag_td + pInfo[2] + tag_td_end; tableRow += tag_td + pInfo[1] + tag_td_end; tableRow += tag_td + “$” + calcFinalCost  pInfo[0], pInfo[3]  + tag_td_end; tableRow += tag_tr_end; document.write  tableRow ;  As you can see, in this example I’ve placed the entire string representing my  table row into a single variable. Then, after I’ve built the string, I simply make one call to document.write   to send the string to the HTML parser. This is nice, but again, the fact that I’ve dropped to a single document.write   call isn’t the point. The point is that I now have the definition for a fairly complex HTML structure   an entire table row  inside a single JavaScript variable! This means that I can reuse this HTML structure over and over again as I build my HTML page.   4804-2 Ch11.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 129  Session 11—Dynamically Creating an HTML Page  129  Creating customized controls While it’s nice to be able to reuse HTML structures at will, the real power of dynamically created HTML comes from creating customized controls for your Web page. For example, it would be nice if the baby-palooza.com product listing con- tained links that the user could click to obtain more information on a given prod- uct. Assuming that the part number for a product is the basis for the name of its information page, this becomes a simple thing to do, as shown below:  var tag_tr = “ ”; var tag_tr_end = “ ”; var tag_td = “ ”; var tag_td_end = “ ”; var tableRow = tag_tr; tableRow += tag_td + category + tag_td_end; tableRow += tag_td + pInfo[2] + tag_td_end; tableRow += tag_td; tableRow += “ ” + pInfo[1] + “ ”; tableRow += tag_td_end; tableRow += tag_td + “$” + calcFinalCost  pInfo[0], pInfo[3]  + tag_td_end; tableRow += tag_tr_end; document.write  tableRow ;  With this code in place, each table row that’s written to the browser will con-  tain a link to a page containing more information about the product listed in that row of the table. And you don’t have to stop at simple links. You can also create a more user-friendly link:  tableRow += “<a href=’” + pInfo[2] + “.htm’”; tableRow += “ onmouseover=’window.status=”; tableRow += ‘“View more information about ‘ + pInfo[1] + ‘“;return true’ + “‘“; tableRow += “>” + pInfo[1] + “ ”;  With this additional code, in addition to giving users a link to more information, when they move the mouse over that link, they get a user-friendly description  in the status bar of the browser  of where the link will be taking them.  In these examples, I’ve only been showing you how to build custom links. If you  wanted to, you could just as easily build some other type of custom control. For example, assume that instead of creating a table row, you wanted your function to  S e s s i o n   1 1  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch11.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 130  130  Saturday Afternoon  create a menu item for use in a select list in a form. The JavaScript to do that might be as simple as this:  var optionItem = “ ”; optionItem += pInfo[1] + “ ”;  The point is that you can create any type of HTML element you want and it can be as customized as you want.  Debugging your dynamically created HTML One problem you might have noticed in the above examples is that the JavaScript code required for creating really useful HTML can quickly become very confusing. This can make it difficult to find the cause of any problems that might come up when you are testing your JavaScript code.  For example, the code required to create a link with an onmouseover event han-  dler is almost unreadable due to all of the nested quotes that you have to work around. One way to make this type of quote nesting easier is to use escaped quotes inside the string you want to build. An escaped quote is one that is preceded by a backslash character  \ . When the JavaScript interpreter sees an escaped quote, it knows that that quote should not be considered as the end of the string. For example, this is an illegal JavaScript string:  var msg = ‘That’s already in your shopping cart.’;  While this version, with an escaped single quote, is perfectly legal:  var msg = ‘That\’s already in your shopping cart.’;  The backslash tells the JavaScript interpreter that it shouldn’t consider this  quote to be the end of the string. Instead, it should be treated just like another character in the string. You can also escape double quotes:  var quote = “Maia says, \”I love shopping at baby-palooza.com!\””;  So, the earlier example of a complex link could be rewritten like this:  tableRow += “ onmouseover=’window.status=\”View more information about “ + pInfo[1] + “\”;return true’>” + pInfo[1] + “ ”;  While making your code more readable isn’t exactly a debugging tip, it can cer- tainly help prevent bugs from occurring in the first place.   4804-2 Ch11.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 131  Session 11—Dynamically Creating an HTML Page  131  Tip  This technique can place any character into a string. For example, \n is a new line character and \t is a tab. You can also include a character by its hexadecimal character code. Simply code \xHH  where HH is the hexadecimal character code  and the character will be inserted into your string. For example, \x20 will put a blank space into your final string.  To see the values for all char- acters, see the charCodes.htm file.   Another problem with dynamically generated HTML is that, in some browsers, the HTML that’s generated never actually shows up when you view the source for the page in the Web browser. This can lead to all sorts of problems, because it’s very difficult to debug source code that you can’t actually see! The solution here is to create a dummy text box control and, after you have built the HTML you are going to output, shove that HTML into the text box so that you can examine it. You’ll also need to put a line feed  \n  at the end of each line of HTML you are placing in the text box, so that it won’t all be strung together.  A complete example  In the Session11 folder on your CD-ROM, you’ll find updated versions of the babyPalooza.js and index.htm files. These files bring all of these concepts together in an updated version of the baby-palooza.com product listing.  Due to the length of these files, I can’t present them here, so be sure to open them in your HTML editor so you can follow along with the discussion.  While these files are basically the same as the ones you saw at the end of Session 6, there are a few new things going on here. If you look in the babyPalooza.js file, you’ll notice that the showProductInfo   function has been changed to build a single output string instead of using multiple document.write   calls. Beyond that, two new global variables have been added: debugFlag and debugInfo. If the debugFlag variable is set to true, the showProductInfo   function will place the string it builds into the debugInfo variable, followed by two carriage returns. The new index.htm file also checks to see if the debugFlag variable is true. If it is, a completely new HTML form is output to the browser. Inside this form is a   control that contains all of the information in the debugInfo variable. This allows me to see exactly what the HTML I’ve built looks like. If you load the index.htm file into your browser you’ll see something like Figure 11-1.

Well, yes, you can. However there is one major “gotcha” to watch out for when dynamically creating a block of JavaScript.  When you output your   and   tags, you should never output  these tags as complete strings. That is to say, you should never ever code some- thing like this:  document.write  “ ” ; document.write  “ ” ;  If you do, the HTML and JavaScript interpreters will get hopelessly confused. They’ll actually think that you are starting a new script block inside your current script block. Since this is a big no-no, you’ll either be presented with an error dia- log or your code will simply stop executing for no apparent reason.   4804-2 Ch11.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 133  Session 11—Dynamically Creating an HTML Page  133  The solution to this problem is actually very simple, just break the “tags” up in  your document.write   calls, like this:  document.write  “ ” ; document.write  “ ” ;  By breaking these strings up like this, you prevent the HTML and JavaScript inter- preters from mistaking them as HTML tags. This ability to dynamically generate JavaScript code is a very powerful feature, so I’ll be discussing it in much more detail in Sessions 20 and 23.  REVIEW  In this session, you learned how to use JavaScript to dynamically create HTML code. You saw how to generate links and other HTML controls that have been cus- tomized to reflect the information that you are presenting to your users. You also learned how to use a text area control to display the HTML that your JavaScript has dynamically created. Finally, you learned that JavaScript can also dynamically generate more JavaScript code, but that there are potential problems that come with generating a new set of    tags.  QUIZ YOURSELF  1.

For exam-  ple, when your users subscribe to an e-mail newsletter or purchase a new computer, you’ll have to present them with a form in order to get the job done. So, to build a truly effective Web site, you have to understand how to use HTML forms and the JavaScript form object.  How the form Object Relates to the   Tag  By now, you should have a pretty good idea of what the form object is. It’s simply a JavaScript object that represents a set of HTML    tags. As you saw in Session 9, the document object actually contains an array of form objects, which goes by the clever name of forms. After an HTML document is loaded and parsed, this array will contain one form object for each set of    tags in the HTML document. The following code shows a simple HTML document with three form objects:  ✔  4804-2 Ch12.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 136  136  Saturday Afternoon                    This will create a forms array with three entries. Since the forms array is a  property of the document object, you can reference these form objects like this:  var firstForm = document.forms[0]; var secondForm = document.forms[1]; var thirdForm = document.forms[2];  Give it a name  If you would rather not refer to your forms by number, you can also give each form object a name. For example, given the simple HTML document I just defined, I could code something like this:  document.forms[0].name = “formZero”;  Here, I’ve simply assigned a string to the name property of the first entry in my  forms array. I could then access this form object like so:  var firstForm = document.formZero;  Being able to assign a name is nice, but you can also specify a name for your  form objects inside your HTML document, as shown here:                    When this HTML document is parsed, the resulting JavaScript form objects will have their name properties automatically set to the names specified in the name= attributes of each   tag. You can then access these form objects like so:   4804-2 Ch12.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 137  Session 12—Working with HTML Forms  137  var firstForm = document.formZero;    Same as document.forms[0] var secondForm = document.formOne;    Same as document.forms[1] var thirdForm = document.formTwo;    Same as document.forms[2]  What’s in a name?  One thing that’s important to note here is that the names I’ve given my form objects are all valid JavaScript variable names. While this isn’t absolutely neces- sary, it’s a very good idea to make sure you only use valid JavaScript variable names for your form objects, as well as the other HTML-based objects you work with. Why? Consider this:                    Since HTML doesn’t place any restrictions on the values that can be used for an attribute, these three name attributes are perfectly valid HTML. However, if I were to try to use these names from JavaScript, I would have to code something like this:  var firstForm = document.form Zero; var secondForm = document.form One; var thirdForm = document.form Two;  Unfortunately, none of these statements will work, because the JavaScript  interpreter will have a very hard time with the blank space in the middle of each name. So, the only way to access these form objects will be through the forms array. The moral of the story is, if you are going to give names to the elements in your HTML documents try to use names that are also valid JavaScript variable names!  How Controls Relate to the form Object  When you build a set of    tags on your HTML page, you rarely leave it empty. In most cases, you’ll fill a form with text boxes, check boxes, pop-up  S e s s i o n   1 2  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch12.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 138  138  Saturday Afternoon  menus and other controls that the user can interact with directly. Each of these has a corresponding HTML tag  or tags  that defines the control. When the HTML document is loaded and parsed by the browser, these tags lead to the creation of corresponding JavaScript objects. As you might expect by now, these control objects can be found inside the form object that they are associated with. For example, take a look at the following HTML document.                                  Add me to your mail list  Here again, I’ve defined three form objects. However, each of these form objects  now contains an object that represents the control inside the form. As with my forms, I’ve specified a name attribute for each control. So, if I want to access these objects I can simply code something like this:  var uNameObject = document.formZero.userName; var addressObject = document.formOne.address; var spamMeObject = document.formTwo.spamMe;  After these statements execute, the new variables I’ve created will hold the objects representing the controls in my three forms.  Suppose that you load that last HTML document into a Web browser and type  your name into the userName text box. How would you actually retrieve that value? Actually, it’s pretty simple to do.  Every type of control that you can create in a form has a corresponding type of JavaScript object. While these objects do differ somewhat, they all follow the same basic format. In particular, they all have a property named value. This property con- tains the current value that the control is set to. The concept of a control’s value dif- fers from one type of control to the next, but, in the case of a text box or text area, the value property will hold the string that’s currently typed into the control in the browser window. So, if I wanted to extract the user’s name, I could code:   4804-2 Ch12.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 139  Session 12—Working with HTML Forms  139  var uNameString = document.formZero.userName.value;  Similarly, if I wanted to set the user’s name, I could code:  document.formZero.userName.value = “John Doe”;  For the most part, this is the way you use JavaScript to get and set the value of  any HTML control. However, as I said before, each type of control object has a slightly different set of properties and methods that allow you do much more than just get or set their value. So I’m going to go over each type of control in detail in the next session.  Inside the form Object  There’s a lot more to the form object than just the name property. Here’s a detailed look at the properties and methods that will give you total control over the forms on your HTML pages.  As always, you’ll find example programs for each of these properties and methods in the Session12 folder on your CD-ROM.   Properties of the form object  A   tag has a lot of different attributes that you can set to control its behav- ior. The form object has properties that correspond to each of these attributes so that you can work with them from JavaScript.   The action property This property holds a Web address that tells the browser where to send the form when the user clicks the Submit button. The initial value for this property is taken from the action= attribute of the   tag. For example, given the following HTML definition      the value of document.orderForm.action will be “processOrder.cgi.” If you assign a new Web address to this property, the form will be sent to that new address when the form’s Submit button is clicked.  The elements array While it’s nice to be able to access a control directly using a name, there might come a time when you want to process your controls in a more automatic fashion.  S e s s i o n   1 2  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch12.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 140  140  Saturday Afternoon  It’s also possible that your controls might not have names, or they might have names that aren’t valid JavaScript variable names. For those situations, the form object provides the elements array.  The elements array is an array that contains all of the control objects defined in the form. You can access the items in this array two ways: by index number or by name. For example, take a look at the following form definition.     First Name:<input type=”text” name=”fname” value=”Maia”  >  Last Name:<input type=”text” name=”last name” value=”Disbrow”  >  Favorite Food:<input type=”text” name=”favorite food” value=”Bananas”  >     In this form I’ve defined three controls. Two of these controls have names that  simply aren’t valid JavaScript variable names. However, I can easily access these controls by using the elements array. Accessing a control by its index in the ele- ments array works just like any other array access:  for  x=0; x<document.myForm.elements.length; x++  {  document.write  document.myForm.elements[ x].name ; document.write  “ contains “ ; document.write  document.myForm.elements[ x].value ; document.write  “ ” ; }  However, if I wanted to use the name of a control, I can do that as well:  document.write  document.myForm.elements[ “fname”].name ; document.write  “ contains “ ; document.write  document.myForm.elements[ “fname”].value ; document.write  “ ” ; document.write  document.myForm.elements[ “last name”].name ; document.write  “ contains “ ; document.write  document.myForm.elements[ “last name”].value ; document.write  “ ” ; document.write  document.myForm.elements[ “favorite food”].name ; document.write  “ contains “ ; document.write  document.myForm.elements[ “favorite food”].value ;  In this case, the elements array is acting like an array with named slots... because it is!   4804-2 Ch12.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 141  Session 12—Working with HTML Forms  141  The encoding property This property is equivalent to the enctype= attribute in a   tag. This attribute tells the Web browser what encoding scheme should be used to transmit the forms data when the Submit button is pressed.  Cross-Ref  A discussion of encoding types is beyond the scope of this book, but you can find a complete discussion of them at the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web site. Start your investigation at the following link: www.w3.org TR html4 interact forms.htmlform-content-type  The length property This property tells you how many controls are in a form object. This is essentially the same as the length property of the form’s elements array.  The method property This property is the same as the method= attribute in a   tag. This property tells the browser which method  post or get  to use when sending the form’s data after the Submit button is clicked.  The name property As you’ve seen already in this session, the name property is the same as the name= attribute of a   tag.  The target property This property corresponds to the target= property in the   tag. This prop- erty lets you specify the name of a browser window or frame that should be used to present the results of the form submission. For example, if your   tag looks like     when the user submits the form, a new browser window with the internal name “resultWindow” will open up and the results of the form submission will be seen in that window.  If a browser window named “resultWindow” already exists, it will come to the front and the results of the submission will be displayed there.   S e s s i o n   1 2  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch12.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 142  142  Saturday Afternoon  Methods of the form object  The form object also has several methods that allow you to trigger the various actions that a form can perform. These methods make it easy to automate most form actions.  The reset   method When a user clicks on a form’s Reset button, the Web browser fires an onreset event  as shown in Session 10  and resets the controls in the form to their default values. If you would like to reset a form from your JavaScript program, calling the reset   method for that form is exactly the same thing as clicking on the form’s Reset button. In fact, the following control definitions have the same effect:    <input type=”button” value=”Reset” onclick=”document.formName.reset  ”  >  Of course, it’s easier to simply define an actual Reset button, but using the reset   method gives you a lot more control over the process of resetting the form. By using the reset   method, you the programmer get to decide when your form should be reset.  The submit   method Whereas the reset   method simulates clicking the Reset button, the submit   method simulates clicking a form’s Submit button. Calling the submit   method is almost exactly the same as waiting around for your user to click the Submit but- ton, but there is one difference. When the user clicks the Submit button, an onsubmit event is fired. However, when your JavaScript program calls the sub- mit   method, there is no onsubmit event generated.  This actually makes quite a bit of sense. The onsubmit event is intended to give  your program a chance to validate the data in a form before it’s submitted. However, if you are calling the submit   method explicitly, you will already be in the middle of your JavaScript program. So, you should have already validated the form’s data before attempting to call the submit   method.   4804-2 Ch12.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 143  Session 12—Working with HTML Forms  143  REVIEW  In this session, you looked at the JavaScript form object and how it relates to the HTML   tag. You learned about the properties and methods of the form object and how they can be used to control the behavior of a form. You also saw how the controls defined in a form relate to the form object and how you can access those controls either by using the name of the control or the elements array.  QUIZ YOURSELF  1. Where are form objects kept in the document object?  See “How the form  Object Relates to the   Tag.”   2. Why should you always give your forms and controls names?  See “Give it  a name.”   3. What property holds the current value of an on-screen control?  See  “Inside the form Object.”   4. How can you use the elements array to get at a control with a name that  isn’t a valid JavaScript variable name?  See “The elements array.”   5. What happens when you call the submit   method for a form? What, if  anything, does not happen?  See “The submit   method.”   S e s s i o n   1 2  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch13.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 145  S E S S I O N  13  Working with HTML Controls  Session Checklist  Learning how to use HTML controls with JavaScript  N ow that you’ve seen how to use your forms from JavaScript, it’s time to  learn the details of how each HTML control can be used from JavaScript. As you’ll see, most controls are very easy to work with. You simply respond to one or two events or you just get or set the control’s value property to determine its current state. However, some controls, like a select list, require a bit more work to use effectively.  Working with Buttons  Buttons are probably the simplest HTML controls that you can define. However, buttons can be very useful to your JavaScript program. By defining an onclick handler for a button, you can have that button trigger any number of actions by your JavaScript code. As you saw in Session 10, you can define an onclick han- dler for a button like this:  <input type=”button” value=”On Screen Button Name” onclick=”handler  ”  >  ✔  4804-2 Ch13.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 146  146  Saturday Afternoon  So, when the user clicks the button, the handler function will be executed.   Remember, an event handler doesn’t have to be a function call, it can simply be one or more JavaScript statements that are coded right into the HTML definition for your control. Refer back to Session 10 for the details on how to create an event handler.   You’ll notice here that, contrary to the advice I’ve given in Session 12, I haven’t given this example button a name= attribute. You can give a button a name if you want, but there usually isn’t any need to. The main reason you would want to give a control a name is if you want to store data in it. The name will simply make retrieval of that data easier. In a button, the value property of the button actu- ally shows up on screen as the text the user sees in the button. So, it’s really not a good idea to go changing the value of a button. However, you can give each of your buttons names if you need to differentiate between them easily.  For exam- ple, a function that could be called by several buttons might need to know exactly which button called it.   In addition to simple buttons like the one shown above, there are two special- ized buttons: the Submit button and the Reset button. These buttons have a pre- defined role in your HTML forms, so they don’t actually support onclick handlers  or any other type of event handler .  While you can’t code an event handler directly into the definitions for these  buttons, they still generate events that your JavaScript code can latch on to. When the user clicks the Submit button for a form, an onsubmit event is generated. Similarly, when the user clicks the Reset button for a form, an onreset event is generated. As you saw in Session 10, instead of specifying the handlers for these events in the buttons themselves, you specify them in the   tag.             When the onsubmit handler is called, your program has a perfect opportunity to check the data in the form to see if it’s valid or invalid. Data validation is an important topic in its own right, so I’ll be discussing it in detail in Session 15.  Working with Check Boxes  Working with check boxes is almost as simple as working with buttons. There are a few important differences though. For example, consider this HTML definition of a simple check box:   4804-2 Ch13.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 147  Session 13—Working with HTML Controls  147    Overnight shipping?   The first thing to notice is that the text label  “Overnight shipping”  that will  appear next to this check box is not defined in the tag itself. Instead, it’s simply a string of characters that appears after the tag.  The label could also come before the tag; it simply depends on how you want your form to be laid out.  This means that our value property can hold actual data. In this, case that data is a single character, “Y”.  While I’ve given my check box a value, that value is only valid if the check box  is actually checked. Now, when I say “valid,” I’m speaking of being “logically” valid. That is to say, the value property of this check box will always be “Y”, but, if the check box isn’t checked, the user obviously doesn’t want anything to do with this option I’ve given them. So, I’ll just ignore whatever value is held in the check box.  The question then becomes, “How do you know if a check box is checked?” This is  where the checked property comes in. This is a Boolean property that simply tells you if a check box is checked or not. If checked is true, the check box is checked. If it is false, the check box isn’t checked. You can even assign a value to this prop- erty and the on-screen appearance of the check box will change accordingly.  If a check box is not checked and you submit the form that it is in, no information about that check box will be sent to the server. That is to say, neither the name of the check box nor its value will be transmitted to the server-side process that’s invoked when the form is submitted. Check box information is transmitted only if the check box is actually checked.  Like buttons, check boxes also generate an onclick event when they are  clicked. This gives your program a chance to instantly reset other parts of your form whenever the user selects or deselects a check box. The trick to using an onclick handler with a check box is to remember that the code for your onclick handler is called after the check box has been checked or unchecked on the screen. The following code shows all of these aspects of check boxes working together.    function doStandard   {  if  document.delivery.standard.checked  {     turn off overnight check box document.delivery.overnight.checked = false; }  Tip  }  S e s s i o n   1 3  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch13.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 148  148  Saturday Afternoon  function doOvernight   {  if  document.delivery.overnight.checked  {     turn off standard check box document.delivery.standard.checked = false; }  }       Select a Delivery Method  <input type=”checkbox” name=”standard” value=”Y” onclick=”doStandard  ”  > Standard Shipping  <input type=”checkbox” name=”overnight” value=”Y” onclick=”doOvernight  ”  > Overnight shipping?      In this example, I’ve defined two check boxes. One representing standard deliv- ery and the other representing overnight delivery. Each check box has an onclick handler that fires when that check box is clicked. The structure of each handler is similar, so I’ll just go over the handler for the standard delivery check box.  When the standard check box is clicked, the doStandard   function executes. The first thing it does is inspect the checked property of the standard check box. If checked is true, it then assigns a false to the checked property of the overnight check box. When this happens, the overnight check box immediately becomes unchecked on screen.  Another way to set a check box is to call its click   method. This will toggle the state of the check box, just as if it had been clicked. The advantage of using the click   method  as opposed to simply assigning a true to the checked prop- erty  is that this method will also fire an onclick event for the check box.  Check boxes also support the onblur, and onfocus events  with corresponding blur   and focus   methods to simulate these events . For more on these events, be sure to refer to Session 10.  Finally, if you need to know whether or not a check box was initially checked, you can inspect its defaultChecked property. If this property is true, the check box was checked when the HTML file was first loaded. If the property is false, the check box was not checked.  Working with the File Upload Control  If you aren’t familiar with the HTML file upload control, don’t worry. Very few  people even know that it exists, let alone how to use it. Basically, the file upload   4804-2 Ch13.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 149  Session 13—Working with HTML Controls  149  control presents the user with a text box and a Browse... button. If users know the path to the file they want to upload, they can type it directly into the text box. However, it’s more likely that users will not know the path to the file, so they will probably just click the Browse... button. When this button is clicked, the browser will present a standard file open dialog. Users can then use this dialog to select a file from their local file system. As soon as a user has selected a file, the path to that file will appear in the text box. Then, when the user submits the form, the file itself will actually be sent to the server.  Note  It’s beyond the scope of this book to investigate what happens once the file gets to the server. The main reason for this is that beyond that point, the process is dependent on the Web server software that is being run. Since I can’t know what kind of Web server software you’ll be running, I’ll just have to tell you to refer to the documentation for your Web server.  If you aren’t familiar with the file upload control, your first question might be,  “What does the HTML for one look like?” Well, it looks like this:     Like most of the other controls you’ll see in this session, a file upload control supports various events like onclick, onblur, and onfocus. However, the most interesting event that this control supports is the onchange event. This event fires after the user selects a different file to upload. If you need to restrict the type of files that can be uploaded, this gives you a great opportunity to check the file to see if it is one of the types you want to allow. The path name of the selected file can be found in the value property of the file upload control. All you have to do is extract this information and use some combination of JavaScript’s string meth- ods to determine if the file’s name fits your criteria.  For an example of using a file upload control, see the fileUpload.htm file on your CD-ROM.   Working with Radio Buttons  The check box example that you saw earlier ensured that only one check box was checked at a time. This behavior is similar to that exhibited by another type of HTML control, the radio button. Radio buttons are actually very similar to check boxes. In fact, you can think of radio buttons as sets of related check boxes. The difference is that only one of these check boxes can be checked at any given time. The simple act of turning one radio button on turns off all the others that are related to it.  S e s s i o n   1 3  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch13.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 150  150  Saturday Afternoon  Groups of related radio buttons are called families. You create a family of radio  buttons by giving all of the radio buttons in the family exactly the same name. For example, the check boxes I defined earlier could be redefined as a family of radio buttons like so:    Standard Shipping    Overnight Shipping   Here, I’ve created two radio buttons and placed them both into the family named  “dMethod”  short for “delivery method” . Now, when one radio button is checked, the other will be unchecked automatically.  The Web browser handles all of this checking and unchecking. Your JavaScript program doesn’t have to do anything.  Another thing to notice is that the value of each radio button holds informa-  tion that directly reflects the meaning behind the check box. So, if the “Standard Shipping” check box is checked, the entire family of radio buttons has a “logical” value of “standard.”  Unfortunately, while a family of radio buttons can be thought to have a logical value that’s equal to the value of the selected radio button, there isn’t a radio but- ton method that will tell you which radio button in a family is selected. To deter- mine which radio button is selected, you have to examine the checked property of each radio button in a family until you find the one where checked is true.  How can you do this? After all, every radio button in a family has exactly the  same name, so how do you tell them apart? Actually, it’s fairly easy to do, because when you create a radio button family, the JavaScript interpreter creates an array to hold information about each radio button in the family. So, in the above exam- ple, dMethod[ 0] is the “Standard Shipping” button and dMethod[ 1] is the “Overnight Shipping” button.  When you submit a form containing a family of radio buttons, the value that’s transmitted for that family is the value associ- ated with the selected radio button  that is, the values of the other radio buttons in the family are not sent to the server .  Note  And, as with check boxes, radio buttons can have an onclick handler. So, know- ing all of this, it’s actually a fairly simple matter to process a family of radio buttons:  function doDelivery   {  var dLen = document.delivery.dMethod.length; for  x=0; x < dLen; x++  {  if  document.delivery.dMethod[ x].checked  {  methodValue = document.delivery.dMethod[ x].value; alert  “You have selected “ + methodValue +   4804-2 Ch13.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 151  Session 13—Working with HTML Controls  151  “ shipping” ; break; }  }  }       Select a Delivery Method  <input type=”radio” name=”dMethod” value=”standard” onclick=”doDelivery  ” checked  > Standard Shipping  <input type=”radio” name=”dMethod” value=”overnight” onclick=”doDelivery  ”  > Overnight Shipping      Here, I’ve added an onclick handler to my radio button definitions. Since these  radio buttons each belong to the same family, they each call the same event han- dler.  Note that they don’t have to call the same onclick handler, but it’s rare to have different onclick handlers for radio buttons in the same family.   When the handler begins to execute, the first thing it does is determine the length of the array that holds the radio button family.  This tells it how many radio buttons are in the family.  At that point, it’s simply a matter of using a for loop to inspect the checked property of each radio button in the array until it finds one that is true. At that point, it can extract the value from that radio but- ton and present it in an alert window. The break statement terminates the loop so that it doesn’t spend time looking at any remaining radio buttons.  Remember, only one radio button in a family can be checked.   Other Radio Button Tips  As I mentioned before, radio buttons and check boxes have a lot in com- mon. As with check boxes, you can assign a true to the checked property of a radio button and that radio button will become checked.  And all of the other radio buttons in the family will turn themselves off.   You can also use the click   method to simulate a mouse click on a radio button and you can use the defaultChecked property to tell if the radio button was selected when the HTML document was loaded.  And, just like check boxes, radio buttons also receive onblur and onfocus events  and have the corresponding blur   and focus   methods .  S e s s i o n   1 3  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch13.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 152  152  Saturday Afternoon  Working with Select Lists  One of the most useful HTML controls available is the select list. A select list lets you present your users with a menu of items that they can pick from. Before going fur- ther with this discussion, take a look at this HTML definition for a simple select list.  Select a Product      Rock & Stroll - Deluxe   Size 3, Extra Absorbent   Ultra-Safe, Rear-Facing   UberNoise 5000   Clean and Fragrant      In this example, I’ve defined a simple select list with five items in it.  Each set of    tags defines an individual menu item.  Each of these items corresponds to one of the products in the Baby-Palooza.com inventory. As you can see, I’ve placed the part number of each product into the value= attribute of each option and I’ve used the description for the product to specify the text that will show up in the select list when this is loaded into the Web browser. While this is a fairly simple select list, it’s a very complicated control in and of itself. So, the question becomes, “How does JavaScript interact with this control?”  The select object  As you might expect, the Browser Object Model defines a JavaScript object called the Select object. This object has several properties and methods that allow you to interact directly with the select lists you define in your HTML forms.  The length property This tells you how many sets of    tags are defined for the select list.  The name property This is the name that is specified in the name= attribute of the   tag.   4804-2 Ch13.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 153  Session 13—Working with HTML Controls  153  The options array This is an array of Option objects. Each item in the array corresponds directly to one set of    tags in the select list. Understanding the options array is the key to working with select lists, so I’ll be discussing it in more detail in just a moment.  The selectedIndex property This property holds the numeric index of the selected item in the options array. So, if the user has selected the first item in the list, the selectedIndex property will have a value of zero.  Remember, JavaScript array index numbers begin with zero.  If no item in the list is selected, this property will contain a negative one  -1 .  The blur   and focus   methods These remove the focus from a select list and give the focus to a select list, respec- tively. They also generate the corresponding onblur and onfocus events for the select list.  The click   method As with the other controls you’ve seen, this simulates a mouse click on the select list.  The onchange event There is one additional event defined for a select list: the onchange event. This event fires when the user actually changes her selection in the list. If the user clicks on the list, but doesn’t change her selection, the event never fires. Compare this to an onclick event, which will fire regardless of whether or not the selection in the list is changed.  Note also that older versions of Netscape Navigator simply don’t support the onclick event for use with select lists, all they support is the onchange event.   Understanding the Options array  As I said, the options array is the key to working with select lists. Because it’s an array, the options array has a length property  which tells you the same thing as the length property of the Select object . Each item in the options array is a JavaScript Option object, each of which represents a single set of     tags. Each individual Option object has the following properties:  S e s s i o n   1 3  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch13.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 154  154  Saturday Afternoon  The defaultSelected property This property holds a Boolean value that tells you if the corresponding menu item was selected by default — that is, when the HTML file was first loaded by the Web browser.  The selected property This is a Boolean value that tells you if the corresponding menu item is currently selected or not. If this is true, the menu item is selected, if it’s false, the menu item is not selected.  The text property This is a String object that holds the text that you defined between the     tags. For example, in the definition   UberNoise 5000  the text property of this Option object will be the string “UberNoise 5000”. It’s important to note that you can assign a new value to this property, effectively changing the text that is displayed for that menu item.  The value property As with the other tags you’ve seen, this property holds the contents of the value= attribute in the original tag. The main difference is that, since each Option object has its own value attribute, a select list can hold a lot of different possible values.  When you submit a form containing a select list, only the value associated with the selected menu item is transmitted to the server. If the select list allows multiple selections, the values of all selected items are transmitted.  Note  A simple select list example  Since the options array is just that, an array, you might be thinking that the sim- plest way to interact with a select list is to simply loop through all of the items in the options array until you find the item where selected is true. You can do this, but don’t forget about the selectedIndex property. Since this property already contains the index number of the selected menu item, you can use it to jump directly to the menu item you are interested in.  This code comes from the selectList.htm file on your CD-ROM.    4804-2 Ch13.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 155  Session 13—Working with HTML Controls  155    function doProductPick   {  var si = document.order.products.selectedIndex; var partNo = document.order.products.options[ si].value; var desc = document.order.products.options[ si].text; alert “You selected part number “+ partNo +”, ‘“+ desc + “‘“ ; }       Select a Product      Rock & Stroll - Deluxe   Size 3, Extra Absorbent   Ultra-Safe, Rear-Facing   UberNoise 5000   Clean and Fragrant         In this code, I’ve added an onchange handler to my select list definition. So when the user changes the selected item in the list, an onchange event will fire and my handler function will be called. When the handler function executes, the first thing it does is to retrieve the value kept in the select list’s selectedIndex property. I can then use this information to directly access the value and text properties of the item that is selected in my select list and report that information back to the user.  Selecting an item in the list  As you’ve just seen, it’s actually pretty simple to read information from a select list. But, what if you want to actually cause an item in the list to become selected? Your first impulse might be to assign a new value to the selectedIndex property of the list. However, that won’t actually make anything happen. Instead, you need to assign a true value to the selected property of the Option object you want to become selected. The following bit of code from the selectAnOption.htm file shows one way you might do this.  function pickNext   {  var si = document.order.products.selectedIndex; if  si ==  document.order.products.length - 1   {  next = 0;  S e s s i o n   1 3  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch13.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 156  156  Saturday Afternoon  } else {  next = ++si; }  si = 0; }  if  si == 0  {  next = --si; }  document.order.products.options[ next].selected = true; }  function pickPrev   {  var si = document.order.products.selectedIndex; if  si == -1  {  next =  document.order.products.length - 1 ; } else {  document.order.products.options[ next].selected = true; }       Select a Product      Rock & Stroll - Deluxe   Size 3, Extra Absorbent   Ultra-Safe, Rear-Facing   UberNoise 5000   Clean and Fragrant              If you load this example file into your Web browser and then click on the “Next”  and “Previous” buttons, you’ll see that the selected item changes as you click the buttons. One additional thing to note is that, when this select list is first loaded into the Web browser, no item will be selected by default. This means that the selectedIndex property of the Select object will be a negative one. So, I have to check for that occurrence explicitly in the code for the pickPrev   function.   4804-2 Ch13.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 157  Session 13—Working with HTML Controls  157  While this example doesn’t include an onchange handler, it’s important to note that when you select a menu item in this fashion, an onchange event is not gener- ated!  So, if you need to completely duplicate an onchange event, you’ll have to call your onchange event handler after you select your new menu item.   Multiple-select lists  Thus far, all the examples you’ve seen have involved single-select lists. That is to say, lists that can only have one item selected at a time. HTML however, provides for another type of selection list, the multiple-selection list. As the name implies, in a multiple-selection list, the user can select as many items from the list as they want. In HTML, the only difference between the two is the addition of a “multiple” attribute to the select list definition. In JavaScript however, the differences are a bit more substantial.  The selectedIndex property and multiple-select lists First and foremost, in a multiple-select list, the role of the selectedIndex prop- erty becomes even more important. In a single-select list, the odds of running into a list with nothing selected are a fairly low. If the HTML definition of the list spec- ifies an initially selected item or if the user selects an item, then the list will always have an item selected from there on out. In a multiple-select list however, the user can select or deselect as many items as she wants. So, it’s entirely possible to have a list with no items selected. Because of this, you should always check the selectedIndex property before performing any operation on a multiple-select list. If the value is negative one  -1 , you’ll know that there is nothing selected in the list and can act accordingly.  If the value of selectedIndex is not negative one, then you know that at least one item in the list is selected. In this case however, the selectedIndex property is only telling you the index of the first selected item in the list. It’s up to you to determine what the other selected items are. The following code is from the multipleSelectList.htm file on your CD-ROM. It shows a typical multiple-select list and how you might use it.  function showSelected   {  var si = document.order.products.selectedIndex; if  si == -1  {  alert  “No items are selected!” ; } else {  S e s s i o n   1 3  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch13.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 158  158  Saturday Afternoon  var report = “You have selected: \n”; var partNo = “”; var desc = “”; for  x=si; x < document.order.products.length; x++  {  if  document.order.products.options[ x].selected  {  partNo = document.order.products.options[x].value; desc = document.order.products.options[x].text; report += partNo + “ - “ + desc + “\n”; }  }  alert  report ; }  }       Select a Product      Rock & Stroll - Deluxe   Size 3, Extra Absorbent   Ultra-Safe, Rear-Facing   UberNoise 5000   Clean and Fragrant      <input type=”button” value=”Show All Selected” onclick=”showSelected  ”  >     As you can see from this example, working with a multiple-select list isn’t really too difficult. The main thing is to check the selectedIndex property immediately before attempting to work with the list. If it turns out that there is at least one item selected, I then enter a simple for loop to check each item in the list.  Note however that the for loop starts its work at the index number reported in the selectedIndex property. This lets me skip over the unselected items at the top of the list.   Adding or removing options in a select list  The last bit of select list information that I want to give to you in this session is how to add and remove items in a select list. That’s right; JavaScript will allow you to add new items to a select list or to remove old items from the list.  To remove an item from a select list, all you have to do is assign a null value to  the options array element that holds the item you want to remove. This will   4804-2 Ch13.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 159  Session 13—Working with HTML Controls  159  remove that item from the list and move all the items below it up to fill the newly emptied space.  Adding an item is a bit more complex. It requires two steps:  1. Create a new Option object using the Option object’s constructor method.   Remember, we discussed constructor methods in Session 6.   2. Assign this new Option object to the end of the options array of the  select list you want the new item to appear in.  The constructor method for the Option object is actually pretty simple. You pass it up to four parameters, and it will return a new Option object that you can add to the end of a select list. Those parameters, in the order that they must appear, are:  1. text: This is the text you want to appear in the menu when the new  2. value: This will be placed into the new item’s value property. 3. defaultSelected: This is used to set the defaultSelected property of  item is added.  the new item.  4. selected: This tells the JavaScript interpreter if the new item should be  selected or not when it is placed into the select list.  All of these parameters are optional, but you should usually provide at least the first two.  If you don’t provide any parameters, you can set the appropriate proper- ties after the new Option object is created.   The addRemoveOptionsSelectList.htm file shows you how all of this can be used to  create dynamic select lists.  Be sure to open this file in your HTML editor so that you can follow along with the next paragraph.  Looking at the HTML portion of this file, you’ll see that I have two select lists, one containing my product information and the other an empty list that will hold the items in the user’s shopping cart. When the user selects an item in the product list and then clicks the “Add to Cart” button, the addToCart   function is called. First, this function checks to see if an item in the product list is selected. If there isn’t a selected item, an alert window is displayed to tell the user to select an item first. If there is an item selected however, the function retrieves the value and text properties of that item and passes them to the Option constructor method to create a new Option item. This new Option item is then assigned to the end of the select list representing our shopping cart. This causes the new item to appear immediately in the shopping cart. Finally, I assign a null to the appropriate element of the products select list, which removes the origi- nally selected item from that list.  removeFromCart   works much the same way. The names of the select lists are reversed to move the selected item from the shop- ping cart back to the products list.

You’re in luck, because it’s time to talk about how JavaScript interacts with the various text-based HTML controls. When I say “text-based,” I’m talking about the controls whose job it is to handle lines or blocks of text. These include text boxes, text areas, password fields, and hidden fields. Here’s an example of each one:         Howdy Terra!           While these are all different types of controls, JavaScript sees them all as con-  trols that handle text. Because of this, you use each of these controls in a very similar fashion.  The most useful thing you can do with a text-based control is simply get or set the text string that’s in it. Because the user can type directly into all of these con- trols  except for hidden field controls  this ability gives you the opportunity to interact directly with the user. As you’ve no doubt guessed by now, to get or set the information in one of these controls, you simply access the value property of the control. When you read the value property, you’ll get back the text as it appears at that moment in the control. When you assign a string to the value property, you’ll change the contents of that control on the screen.  For examples of how to use these controls, see the textBasedControls.htm file.   Text-based control tips  When you work with a password field, remember that what appears on screen will be shown as all asterisks  *  or some other character. This is to prevent someone from stealing a password by looking over someone’s shoulder. However, when you access the value property of a password field, you’ll get the actual text of the pass- word. So, if you display that information on the screen, you’ll be revealing the user’s password! Most users won’t like that, so be careful when you work with password fields.   4804-2 Ch13.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 161  Session 13—Working with HTML Controls  161  Hidden fields have slowly become the workhorse of HTML controls. They can  contain just about any type of string or numeric data and the length of the data they hold depends only on how much memory the Web browser is willing to let them have. As you cruise the Internet looking at JavaScript code, you’ll see lots of programmers hiding lots of crucial information in hidden fields. So, be on the lookout for it.  Text-based control events  Like most of the other controls you’ve seen, the text-based controls  with the exception of hidden fields  support the onblur and onfocus events. Another interesting event supported by text-based controls is the onchange event. This event fires when the contents of a text-based control are changed and then the control loses the focus. As we’ll see in Session 15, these events give your program the perfect opportunity to react to user input and validate the values that they type into your forms.  REVIEW  In this session, you’ve gotten a detailed look at how JavaScript interacts with each type of HTML control. Although all of the controls work in much the same way  by keeping the really good stuff in the value property , you saw how each different control requires a slightly different approach from your JavaScript code. You learned the differences between check boxes and radio buttons as well as how to use a select list. You also learned how to use each of the different text-based con- trols. In Session 15, you’ll build on this knowledge and learn how to ensure that the data a user enters into your form controls is valid for your application.  QUIZ YOURSELF  1.

Because of their popularity, pictures have infiltrated almost every part of the Web browsing experience. For example, instead of HTML buttons,  most Web sites feature clickable images that change when you move the mouse over them. While you might know and love all of these neat little graphic tricks, you might not know that JavaScript is the power behind almost each and every one of them. In this session, you’ll learn how to use JavaScript to interact with the images in an HTML document and how you can create these simple animations to enhance users’ experiences on your site.  ✔  4804-2 Ch14.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 164  164  Saturday Afternoon  Understanding the Image Object  The key to manipulating the images in your HTML documents is the JavaScript Image object. When your HTML document loads into the Web browser, the JavaScript interpreter creates an Image object for each   tag that it finds in the document. It places all of these Image objects in an images array  which you’ll find in the document object . If you don’t want to use the images array, you can specify a name= attribute for each   tag and access your Image objects directly. For example, assuming that the following tag is the first image in a document:     You can access the associated Image object by using either document.images[ 0] or document.happyBaby. If, for some reason, you can’t give your images names that are also valid JavaScript variable names, you can still access them by name by using the images array just like you would use the elements array in a form object. For example, if you have an image defined like this:     You can access it by using the images array, like so:  var poorlyNamedImage = document.images[ ‘poorly named’];  Properties of the Image object  Now that you know how to get to an Image object, you’ll want to know exactly what it is that you’ll find there.  You’ll find sample source code that exercises all of these properties in the Session14 folder on your CD-ROM.   The border property This property contains the border value that was set for the image in the   tag. For example, given this tag, the border property for document.happyBaby will be 10:     The complete property This is a Boolean property that tells you if an image has completed loading.   4804-2 Ch14.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 165  Session 14—Working with Images  165  The height and width properties These properties tell you the current height and width  in pixels  of the picture. If you specify height and width attributes in your   tag, these properties will reflect those values. If you do not specify these attributes, these properties will be the actual height and width of the image. Note that after an image loads, you can assign a new value to either property and the image will be resized accordingly.  For an example of both properties, see the heightNwidthProperties.htm file on your CD-ROM.   The hspace and vspace properties These represent the the amount of horizontal and vertical padding used to offset the image from the content around it. Note that these properties can be changed after the image finishes loading and the image will be repositioned accordingly.  See also the discussion of the vspace property, below.   The name property This is the name of the image. If name is a valid JavaScript variable name, you can use it to access the image directly rather than having to go through the images array.  The src and lowsrc properties This is the Web address of the picture that should be loaded for this image. If you assign a new value to this property, the Web browser will actually load the picture stored at that address. This is the basis for all JavaScript-based animations. For more information, see the sections “Creating Rollovers with JavaScript” and “Creating an Animation with JavaScript” later in this session.  The lowsrc property is the Web address of a low-resolution version of the  image. If the browser is running on a device with a low resolution, this image will be used instead of the one specified by the src property.  Image object events  As you saw in Session 10,   tags support several events that allow you to detect if and when an image actually loads successfully. I’m listing them again here to be complete, but you should refer back to the sample source code for Session 10 to see a simple example of each of these event handlers in action.  S e s s i o n   1 4  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch14.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 166  166  Saturday Afternoon  The onabort event This event fires if the user stops the loading of an image — that is, if the user clicks the browser’s Stop button before the image is fully loaded.  The onerror event This event fires if there is an error during the loading of an image.  The onload event This event fires after an image has been successfully loaded into the browser.  Images without the   tag  As I said at the start of this session, the JavaScript interpreter creates an Image object for each   tag that it finds in your HTML document. However, if you want, you can create Image objects that don’t have an associated   tag. You do this by using the Image object constructor, like so: var myImage = new Image  ; This statement will create a new Image object without an associated   tag. At this point, you can load an actual image file into this Image object simply by assigning a Web address to its src property, like this: myImage.src = “happyBaby.jpg”;  When this picture finishes loading, you’ll have an Image object with a picture  loaded into it. However, that picture will not show up in the Web browser! In order for an image to show up in the Web browser, it must be associated with an   tag somewhere in the HTML document. Without this association, the Web browser simply doesn’t know where to draw the image. Assume that the code you’ve just looked at has executed and that in your HTML file, you have the following   tag:     If you execute the following JavaScript statement   document.babyFace.src = myImage.src;  the graphic that was contained in document.babyFace will be replaced by the graphic in myImage. Furthermore, because document.babyFace is associated with an   tag in the HTML document, the new graphic will replace the old graphic in the Web browser!   4804-2 Ch14.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 167  Session 14—Working with Images  167  Creating Rollovers with JavaScript  Now that you’ve seen how one graphic can replace another, you’ll probably want to see how to use that fact to do something useful. The simplest thing you can do with this technique is to create what’s called a rollover button. These are called rollovers because when you roll the mouse over them, they change somehow. The effect can be as simple as a change in highlighting or you can actually switch to a completely different graphic.  The first step in creating a rollover button is to create a link that just happens  to be an image. This is as simple as surrounding an   tag with a set of    tags. For example, suppose I wanted to create a “More Info” image that would let my users jump to a page with further information on a  product. Such a link might look like this:       This will place an image on an HTML page that is surrounded by a standard link. When the user clicks this image, the link will activate and she will jump to the specified page.  In order to create a rollover, you have to tell the browser to swap this image  with another one when the mouse moves on top of the image. Then, to complete the rollover effect, you need to restore the original image when the mouse moves away. If you remember what you learned in Session 10, you’ve probably realized that the key to creating this effect is to use the onmouseover and onmouseout events to detect when the mouse has moved over and off of the image.  Now, both the   and   tags support the onmouseover and onmouseout events, so its really a matter of personal preference as to which tag you associate these events with. When creating a rollover, I personally prefer to hook the events to the   tag. By doing so, I’ve created a complete little animation all in one tag. For example:    <img name=’stMore’ src=’moreInfo.jpg’ border=’0’ onmouseover=”document.stMore.src=’moreInfoOn.jpg’” onmouseout=”document.stMore.src=’moreInfo.jpg’”  >   While this might look like a very complex bit of code, it’s actually fairly simple. As before, the    tags create a link that surrounds our   tag. So, when the image is clicked, the user will jump to the specified page.  S e s s i o n   1 4  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch14.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 168  168  Saturday Afternoon  The   tag is given the name “stMore” and told  by the “src=” attribute  to  initially load the graphic file moreInfo.jpg. The border property is set to zero so that no border will appear around the image.  The event handlers are where all the action is. The onmouseover handler says,  “When the mouse comes over this tag, change the src property of the document.stMore Image object to be moreInfoOn.jpg.” As you learned earlier, when you change the src property of an Image object, the browser will actually load the specified image. If the Image object is associated with an   tag  like this one is , the new image will then replace the old one in the Web browser.  When the mouse moves over this image, the new image will be loaded and replace  the old image. All that’s left to complete the effect is to restore the old image.  When the mouse moves off of the image, the onmouseout event handler will  execute. As you can see, this handler is almost the same as the onmouseover han- dler. The only difference is that this handler assigns the original graphic back to the src property of the Image object. This forces the browser to redraw the origi- nal graphic, and completes the rollover effect.  Note that you’ll find the source code for this example in the simpleRollover.htm file on your CD-ROM.   Creating an Animation with JavaScript  By now, you’ve probably already figured out how to do animations all by yourself. It’s just a rollover with a lot more images, right? Well, sort of. When you are per- forming an animation, there are a couple of other things to consider besides just switching images. First, you have to decide how you will keep track of all the images in your animation. Second, you have to somehow preload the images in your animation, so that the first time it runs, there won’t be a noticeable lag between frames. Finally, you have to decide how fast your animation is going to be.  Store your animation frames in an array  The answer to the first problem is actually pretty simple: Just store each frame of your animation in an array. Remember, JavaScript arrays can hold any type of data, so it’s a simple matter to build one that holds a series of Image objects. Of course, storing your images in an array implies that you’ll be stepping from frame to frame using a numeric index into the array. This in turn means that you’ll have to load the images into the array in some sort of order. The upshot of all this is that the frames of your animation need to be stored in a series of files that are numbered in the order in which the frames should be played. For example, if you have a three- frame animation, you might number the individual graphic files like this:  myAnim0.jpg, myAnim1.jpg, myAnim3.jpg   4804-2 Ch14.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 169  Session 14—Working with Images  169   Of course, you can start your numbering with “1,” but, since JavaScript starts numbering arrays with zero, I always find it easier to start my numbering with zero as well.   Preloading images  The second problem is that of preloading the images that make up your animation. Solving this problem is as simple as creating the Image objects that will hold the frames and then setting each one’s src attribute to the appropriate file name. This will begin the process of loading each frame while your HTML page is still being loaded into the browser. You can then delay the start of the animation until the complete property of the last frame becomes true.  An example of creating and loading animation frames  At this point, it’s probably a good idea to go ahead and show you how what I’ve discussed so far fits together. The following code shows you how to create an array of images and begin loading all of your animation frames into it.  var titleFrames = new Array  ; var titleNumFrames = 16; for  x=0; x < titleNumFrames; x++  {  titleFrames[ x] = new Image  ; titleFrames[ x].src = “titleAnim” + x + “.jpg”; }  The first thing to notice is that none of this code is part of a function. In fact,  when you look at the actual source file that this code comes from  the simpleAnimation.htm file , you’ll see that these lines of code are in a   block that’s at the top of my HTML document. So, these lines execute immediately as the document is being loaded. The first line creates a new Array object called titleFrames.  The purpose of this example is to create a title animation for the baby-palooza.com site, so all of the associated variable names begin with the string “title.”  Next, I set up a global variable that tells the program how many frames there are in my animation. In this example there are 16 frames, named titleAnim0.jpg through titleAnim15.jpg.  After I’ve set up my variables, I enter a for loop. Each time through this loop, I create a new Image object and assign it to the next slot in my array. After creating the Image object, I immediately set its src property to the name of the next image file in my animation. Notice how I’m using JavaScript’s ability to concatenate  S e s s i o n   1 4  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch14.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 170  170  Saturday Afternoon  strings with numbers to generate the correct file name each time through the loop. Each time I assign a value to one of these src properties, the Web browser begins loading the specified image file.  Timing your animation  Now it’s time to actually start and run the animation. To properly discuss how this is done, I need to show you all of the source code involved. So, here it is:    var titleFrames = new Array  ; var titleNumFrames = 16; var titleAnimSpeed = 200; var titleCurrentFrame = 1; for  x=0; x < titleNumFrames; x++  {  titleFrames[ x] = new Image  ; titleFrames[ x].src = “titleAnim” + x + “.jpg”; }  function titleAnimate   {  if  titleFrames[ titleNumFrames - 1].complete  {  document.titleAnim.src = titleFrames[  titleCurrentFrame++].src;  if  titleCurrentFrame == titleNumFrames  {  titleCurrentFrame = 0; }  } else {  }  setTimeout ‘titleAnimate  ’, titleAnimSpeed ; }    <img name=’titleAnim’ src=’titleAnim0.jpg’ border=’0’ onload=”setTimeout ‘titleAnimate  ’, titleAnimSpeed ”  >  At the top of this code, you can see that I’ve specified two other global vari- ables. The first, titleAnimSpeed, holds the number of milliseconds delay that should come between frames. The second, titleCurrentFrame, tells the program which frame of the animation to display next. After the set up of the global vari- ables, you’ll find the for loop that loads the animation frames into my array of Image objects.   4804-2 Ch14.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 171  Session 14—Working with Images  171  After this is the titleAnimate   function. This function actually performs the  image swapping in my animation. I’ll come back to this in a few moments.  Finally, you see the   tag that actually drives the animation. I’ve given this   the name titleAnim and the picture that’s initially loaded into it is titleAnim0.jpg  which is the first frame of my animation .  Now, how can an   tag drive my animation? Well, look at the onload han- dler that’s defined for this tag and remember that the onload event for an   tag only fires when the image has actually finished loading. When the image fin- ishes loading, the onload handler will call the setTimeout   method and pass it the name of my animation function and tell it to wait 200 milliseconds before call- ing it.  Remember the value in titleAnimSpeed is 200.   So, 200 milliseconds after the first frame of my animation loads, the  titleAnimate   function is called. The first thing this function does is check and see if the last frame of my animation has finished loading. If it has not, the func- tion makes another call to the setTimeout   method, which delays the start of the animation another 200 milliseconds. This continues until the final frame of the animation has finished loading and the animation is ready to commence.  If the final frame of my animation has finished loading the function takes the src property of the current animation frame and assigns it to the src property of the titleAnim Image object. Since the titleAnim Image object is tied to an   tag, the new picture replaces the old one on the screen.  Note the use of the increment operator  ++  in the assignment statement. This  will bump up the current frame of the animation by one. The if statement that follows will then check to see if the end of the animation has been reached. If it has, the number of the current frame is reset to zero so that the animation can start all over again.  If you think there’s something missing from this whole scenario, you’re  absolutely correct. Even if you understand every line of this code, you might be wondering, “Where’s the next call to setTimeout  ? How can the animation progress if the titleAnimate   function doesn’t call setTimeout   again?”  Actually, there isn’t any need for another call to the setTimeout   method, because there’s one already built into the   tag! You see, when you assign a new value to an Image object’s src property, you are starting the process of load- ing the image all over again. So, if that Image object is tied to an   tag, and that tag has an onload handler, that handler will be executed every time you assign a new value to the Image object’s src property. This means that the simple act of switching animation frames actually kicks off the process that will cause the next frame to be loaded.  OK, I admit it ... creating an animation this way is a lot of work. However, this technique does work with any graphic file format that your browser can load. So,  S e s s i o n   1 4  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch14.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 172  172  Saturday Afternoon  if you have bunch of .jpg or .png files that you want to animate, you can do so without having to convert them into a .gif animation. In fact, if you don’t mind a bit of extra work, you can even create your animation using files that are stored in different graphics formats!  Loading Images Based on Screen Size  In Session 8, I briefly mentioned the screen property of the window object. This property holds information about the client’s current screen settings. So you can, for example, use this information to determine if your graphics will fit on the client’s screen. If your default graphics won’t fit the screen properly, you can either load a set of correctly sized graphics  which will require you to actually have a set of correctly sized graphics , or you can dynamically reset the width and height properties of your Image objects. An example of the first approach is shown in the following code:  for  x=0; x < titleNumFrames; x++  {  titleFrames[ x] = new Image  ; if  screen.availWidth < 800  {  titleFrames[ x].src = “titleAnim” + x + “-small.jpg”; } else {  titleFrames[ x].src = “titleAnim” + x + “.jpg”; }  }  Here, I’m checking the availWidth property of the window.screen object. If it  is less than 800 pixels, I’m loading an equivalent, but smaller, version of my ani- mation frame.  The other approach relies on the fact that, if you resize an image along one  axis, the browser will automatically scale it properly along the other axis.  <img name=’titleAnim’ src=’titleAnim0.jpg’ border=’0’ onload=”setTimeout ‘titleAnimate  ’, titleAnimSpeed ”  >   if  screen.availWidth < 800  {  document.titleAnim.width = document.titleAnim.width   2; }      4804-2 Ch14.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 173  Session 14—Working with Images  173  REVIEW  In this session, you learned all about how JavaScript interacts with images on the HTML page. You saw how to create a rollover button and how event handlers can be used as triggers for changing the images that are displayed in the Web browser. You also learned how to create a JavaScript-based animation and how to dynami- cally resize the images in the browser to fit the available space in the client’s browser window. With all of this under your belt, it’s time to begin dressing up the shopping cart. On your CD-ROM, you’ll find new versions of the index.htm and babyPalooza.js files. These new versions incorporate just about everything you’ve learned from this session to add an animated title and rollover buttons to the basic product display.  To see the new look of the shopping cart, load the index.htm file from the Session14 folder.  Take a few moments to study these files and you’ll have a good idea of how the information from this session can be combined with the knowledge you already have.  QUIZ YOURSELF  1.

As the Web has become more and more popular, this ability has become increasingly important. After all, if thousands of people are hitting the same Web site every second, it’s much easier for the Web server to cope if most of the data validation chores can be performed on the client.  Another reason to perform data validation on the client is so your users will get  immediate feedback. When you validate form data with JavaScript, you can instantly tell users that there is a problem and get it corrected. If you send the data to the server for validation, the user has to sit there and wait for the data to be sent, processed, and a result page returned. If the data was bad, the user then has to back up a page, fix it, and send it off again. This can be incredibly frustrat- ing, especially if the error message that comes back from the server is cryptic or incomplete.  ✔  4804-2 Ch15.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 176  176  Saturday Afternoon  Program Defensively  The key to data validation is to assume, right from the beginning, that users will be entering bad data. Yes, this is a pessimistic view, and it does mean more work for you, the programmer, but adopting it will save you a lot of heartache in the long run. Actually, there isn’t really that much extra work involved; all you have to do is look for ways to remove the possibility of bad data being entered. A few ways to do this include:  cid:2  Set up default values that make sense. If you supply good default values in your form fields, the user may never even touch most of the fields, which means they won’t enter bad data in them.  Another advantage is that if the user resets the form, the default values will be reloaded. If this isn’t the behavior that you want, you can create an onreset event handler to reset the form the way you want.    cid:2  Protect fields that you don’t want changed. Very few people realize that JavaScript makes it easy to set up a field so that users can’t mess with it. As you’ll see later in this session, an onfocus handler is all you need to make this happen.   cid:2  Use select lists whenever possible. If you present users with a list of possi- ble values for a form field, it’s impossible for them to enter bad data into that field. For example, instead entering a two-character state code  AL, AK, and so forth  into a text box, give them a select list with all of the states already in it. Like this:      Alabama   Alaska         cid:2  Provide an interface that controls how the user can make changes to the form. For example, provide buttons that increase or decrease a value by a certain amount.  Setting up default values  If you are using JavaScript to dynamically generate your HTML page  as seen in Session 11 , it’s very simple to set up controls with appropriate default values. As an example of this, let me return to the shopping cart I’ve been building. To create   4804-2 Ch15.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 177  Session 15—Validating Form Data  177  an informative shopping cart display, it’s a good idea to include a count of how many units of an item are available along with a count of how many units the user has put in her cart. One way to display this information on screen would be to put each value in its own text field. To implement this in my shopping cart, I need to add two slots to my product arrays: one for the quantity on hand and another for the number of units the user has in her shopping cart. So, my product array defin- ition would now look like this  note that all of the code you’ll be seeing in this session can be found in the index.htm and babyPalooza.js files in the Session15 folder on your CD-ROM :  var index = 0; var strollerInfo = new Array  ; strollerInfo[index++] = 199.95; strollerInfo[index++] = “Rock & Stroll - Deluxe”; strollerInfo[index++] = “st-001”; strollerInfo[index++] = 20; strollerInfo[index++] = 10;    Quantity on hand strollerInfo[index++] = 0;    Number in cart  Now, assuming that I want to display each of these new values in a text field, it’s a fairly simple matter to come up with the JavaScript code that will generate the appropriate HTML. For example, the following shows the code I’ll add to the showProductInfo   function to create the needed text fields.  var onHandBox = “<input type=’text’ name=’quan_” + pInfo[2] + “‘“;  onHandBox += “ value=’” + pInfo[4] + “‘ size=’6’  >”;  var inCartBox = “<input type=’text’ name=’inCart_” + pInfo[2]+ “‘“; inCartBox += “ value=’” + pInfo[5] + “‘ size=’6’  >”;  As you can see, this code will create two text field definitions. Each of these  definitions will have a default value attribute that’s taken directly from my prod- uct information array. The tags created by this code will look like this:        Another simple defensive trick is to use the maxlength= attribute of your text  fields to restrict the amount of data that can be entered into a field. For example, if a field will hold a 5-digit postal code, you would set the maxlength= attribute to 5.   S e s s i o n   1 5  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch15.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 178  178  Saturday Afternoon  Protecting fields with an onfocus handler  Now that I have these text fields defined, I need to determine exactly how I want the user to interact with them. The inCart field is pretty simple: I want the user to be able to type a number directly into it so that they can specify exactly how many units of an item that they want. It would also be nice if there were a button or two that would increase or decrease the number in this field by one. I’ll show you how to do that in just a moment, but first I need to talk about the quantity on hand field.  The quantity on hand field poses a bit of a problem: I want to be able to update it myself  to reflect how many units of an item remain , but I don’t want the user to be able to change the value in the field. Fortunately, the solution to this prob- lem is incredibly simple, as shown here:  <input type=’text’ name=’quan_st-001’ onfocus=”document.cart.elements[‘inCart_st-001’].focus  ” value=’10’ size=’6’  >  In this code, I’ve added an onfocus event handler to the definition of my quan-  tity on hand text field. All the handler does is call the focus   method for the corresponding inCart text field. As I’ve mentioned before, the onfocus event is generated when a control becomes the target of the user’s keystrokes. So, if the user clicks in this field or tabs to it, the onfocus handler will be called. The han- dler will then call the focus   method for the inCart field. This method then makes the inCart control the target of the user’s keystrokes. The overall effect is that when the user tries to type something into the quantity on hand field, the insertion point will actually jump to the inCart field! The upshot of this is that with this event handler in place, the user can never type anything into my quan- tity on hand field.  If your site is based on HTML v4.0 or XHTML, a simpler approach is to create your controls with the readonly attribute. As the name implies, this attribute makes a control read-only, so that the user cannot edit its contents. For example,   would create a read- only text box. However, this attribute is not available in older versions of HTML, while the JavaScript-based approach shown above should work in most JavaScript- capable browsers.   Controlling user input  With the quantity on hand field protected, I can now turn my attention to the inCart field. As I said before, I’d like the user to be able to type a number into this field to immediately specify how many units of an item they want. However, in addition to that ability, I’d like to provide users with a set of buttons that will allow   4804-2 Ch15.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 179  Session 15—Validating Form Data  179  them to add or subtract one unit at a time. These buttons  along with the rest of the new shopping cart design  are shown at the end of each row in Figure 15-1.  S e s s i o n   1 5  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n  Figure 15-1 Shopping cart with text fields and other controls added  As you can see, these are simple plus and minus buttons. When the user clicks one, I want the buttons to react with an appropriate animation — that is, the but- tons should appear to depress and then pop back up — and to either add or sub- tract one unit to the appropriate inCart text field. The HTML that sets this up looks like this:  <img name=’plus_st-001’ src=’plus.jpg’ onmousedown=”document.images[‘plus_st-001’].src=’plusOn.jpg’” onmouseout=”document.images[‘plus_st-001’].src=’plus.jpg’”  onmouseup=”document.images[‘plus_st-001’].src=’plus.jpg’”  >  <img name=’minus_st-001’ src=’minus.jpg’ onmousedown=”document.images[‘minus_st-001’].src=’minusOn.jpg’” onmouseout=”document.images[‘minus_st-001’].src=’minus.jpg’” onmouseup=”document.images[‘minus_st-001’].src=’minus.jpg’”  >  In this code, I’m using three mouse-related event handlers to control the anima-  tion for my buttons.  The onmouseout handler is necessary to handle the case where the user clicks the button, but moves the mouse away from the button before they let go of the mouse button.  As shown here, this code only creates a   4804-2 Ch15.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 180  180  Saturday Afternoon  couple of animated buttons. If I actually want to react to clicks on these buttons, I have to change the onmouseup handlers to call a function that will update the val- ues in my text fields.   onmouseup=”doPlus ‘st-001’ ;document.images[‘plus_st- 001’].src=’plus.jpg’” onmouseup=”doMinus ‘st-001’ ;document.images[‘minus_st- 001’].src=’minus.jpg’”  Here I’ve defined a couple of new functions: doPlus   and doMinus  . These  functions add one and subtract one unit of an item from the user’s shopping cart. To specify which item is being added or removed, I pass each function an appropri- ate part number. Since these functions are so similar, I’ll just go over the first one, doPlus  :  function findPartNo  partNo  {  var result = “”; for  x=0; x < productInfo.length; x++  {  if  productInfo[x][2] == partNo  {  result = productInfo[x]; break; }  }  return result; }  function doPlus  partNo  {  var prodInfo = findPartNo  partNo ;    Do we have enough on hand to do this? if  prodInfo[ 4] > 0  {     Update the quantities in the array prodInfo[ 4]--; prodInfo[ 5]++;    Copy these new values to the form document.cart.elements[ “quan_” + partNo].value = prodInfo[ 4]; document.cart.elements[ “inCart_” + partNo].value = prodInfo[ 5]; } else {  alert  “There are no more of this item in stock!” ; }  }   4804-2 Ch15.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 181  Session 15—Validating Form Data  181  When doPlus   is called, the first thing it does is use the findPartNo   func- tion to search for the array that contains the selected product information. As you can see, the findPartNo   function is just a simple for loop that moves through the productInfo array until it finds a match for the part number that was speci- fied. At that point, the entire sub array is returned to the caller  in this case, the doPlus   function .  Once the doPlus   function has the correct product information, it checks to see if there are any units remaining in stock. If there aren’t, an alert window is displayed to alert the user to this fact. If however, there is at least one more unit in stock, the function subtracts one from the quantity on hand field and adds one to the number in cart field.  After this, all that’s left is to copy these new values to the text fields on-screen.  To do this, the function takes the part number it was passed and uses it to access the text fields via the elements array in the form.  Remember, the elements array in a form object lets you access a control in the form by supplying a string con- taining the control’s name. Instead of hard-coding that string, I’m simply building it on the fly.  This updates the text fields on the screen and lets the user know that the item has been added to the cart.  Validating Text Fields  At this point, all that’s left is to make sure the user doesn’t type something invalid into one of the inCart text fields. This is easily accomplished using an onchange event handler. The following HTML shows how to set this up.  <input type=’text’ name=’inCart_st-001’ onchange=’enterQuantity “st-001” ’ value=’0’ size=’6’  >  As mentioned before, an onchange event fires when the user changes the value  in a control and the control loses the focus. So, this is a great time to make sure the user has typed in a value that’s appropriate for the control. In this case, I need to check to see if the control is empty and, if not, does it contain a number?  Checking for blank text fields  Checking for a blank text field is one of the simplest, and most common, data vali- dation tasks in programming. After all, it’s very hard to give your users what they want if they don’t supply you with all the information you need. So, it’s very important to have a function handy that can check for a blank string in a field.  S e s s i o n   1 5  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch15.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 182  182  Saturday Afternoon  function isBlank  theString  {  var result = true; if  theString != “”  {  for  x=0; x < theString.length; x++  { var theChar = theString.charAt  x ; if  theChar != “ “  {  result = false; break; }  }  }  return result; }  This function takes a very simplistic approach to checking for a blank string.  First it compares the string to the empty string. If the string is not empty, it then checks each character in the string to see if any of them are not space characters. If even one character is not a space, the string is not blank and so the function returns a false. Otherwise, the function returns a true.  You might have noticed that this function checks a string and not a text field. I’ll show you how to use this function with a text field in just a moment.   Checking for numeric values  Another common task is checking user input to make sure that it contains nothing but numbers. There are lots of ways to do this, one of which looks like this:  function isNumeric  theString  {  var validChars = “0123456789”; var result = true; for  x=0; x < theString.length; x++  { var theChar = theString.charAt  x ;    is this char in the set of validChars? if  validChars.indexOf  theChar  == -1  {  result = false; break; }  }  return result; }   4804-2 Ch15.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 183  Session 15—Validating Form Data  183  This is another fairly simple operation. I’m simply checking each character in  the string to see if it is one of the characters 0 to 9. If even one character isn’t in this set of valid characters, the entire string is rejected.  Using data validation in a program  Now that I’ve got functions to check for blank and numeric values, I can use these functions to create my enterQuantity   function. This function is quite lengthy, so instead of presenting it here, I’ll ask you to find it in the babyPalooza.js file  in the Session15 folder on your CD-ROM  and follow along in your HTML editor.  As you saw a bit earlier, an onchange event in one of my inCart text fields will cause this function to execute. The first thing the enterQuantity   function does is grab the product information array that the user is trying to update. Then, it retrieves the value that is typed into the text field and checks to see if that value is blank. If it is, we set the value to a “0” string and proceed.  It seems reasonable to me that someone would empty a field to zero it out, so that is what this code assumes.   Once the function has retrieved the string from the text box, it needs to make sure that it is actually a number. If the isNumeric   function says the string is not a number, the function puts up an alert window to that effect and resets the value in the inCart text field to the value that is saved in the product informa- tion array. If however, the value is a number, things get a little more interesting. First, the function uses a JavaScript function named parseInt   to convert the string into an actual number. The parseInt   function can take up to two para- meters, the first is the string you want to convert and the second is the base of the number that the string represents. In this case, my number is a decimal value, so I pass a base value of 10.  Note that you don’t have to supply base information to the parseInt   function. If you don’t however, parseInt   will look at the string itself for a hint as to what the base of the number is. If the number starts with a 0 character, it will assume that the number is octal  base 8 . If the number starts with 0x it will assume that it is hexadecimal  base 16 . So, just to be on the safe side, I always specify the base of the number I’m converting.   Once the conversion is done, the function makes sure that there are enough units to cover the request. If not, it will display an alert window and reset the value in the inCart text field to the value saved in the product information array. If there are enough units to cover the request, the function performs the neces- sary math to update the product information array and then puts those new values into the appropriate fields in the form.  If you are wondering why this function is returning a Boolean result, see the “Validating Data When a Form Is Submitted” section later in this Session.   S e s s i o n   1 5  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch15.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 184  184  Saturday Afternoon  Validating Other Types of Controls  Of course, not every form is made up of nothing but text fields. However, text fields are probably the most difficult to validate. After all, text fields can contain just about any type of data and that data can have all sorts of restrictions on it. The techniques I’ve just shown you are intended to give you an idea of how to go about writing your own data validation routines for your own text fields. The other types of fields you can include in a form are, for the most part, self-validat- ing. For example, if you set it up correctly, a select list should contain nothing but valid values. As for check boxes and radio buttons, if you need to require that one or more of them be turned on or off, you can check them simply by looking at the checked property of each control and reacting accordingly.  About the only other type of control that really requires any sort of data vali-  dation is the file upload field.  For an example of how to validate one of these fields, see “Working with the File Upload Control” in Session 13.   Validating Data When a Form Is Submitted  The examples I’ve shown so far try to validate the data in a form as the user is entering that data. However, you can wait until a form is submitted before you validate its data. As you saw in Session 10, you do this by creating an event han- dler for the onsubmit event. When the user clicks a Submit button it generates an onsubmit event. Your onsubmit handler can then check each field in the form for valid data. If you find something wrong with the form, your event handler can return a false and the form will not be submitted. If the data is good, you can simply return a true and the form will be submitted.   Actually, it’s usually a good idea to do both kinds of data validation. In other words, check the data as it’s being entered and then again when the user clicks the Submit button. This gives you an extra bit of protection against those users that like to kill time by finding ways to break Web sites. With that in mind, here’s the doSubmit   function that I’m using to check my data one last time before submitting it.  function doSubmit   { var partNo = “”; var result = true;    Look at each product in the inventory for  y=0; y < productInfo.length; y++  {  partNo = productInfo[ y][ 2];    Get the part number    And use that to check each field   4804-2 Ch15.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 185  Session 15—Validating Form Data  185  if  !enterQuantity  partNo   {  result = false; break; }  }  return result; }  You might have noticed earlier that the enterQuantity   function returns a  Boolean result. Here is why: By returning a Boolean result, I can reuse the enterQuantity   function to automatically validate each field from the doSubmit   function. If any field has bad data in it, the enterQuantity   will report that fact and the doSubmit   function can then return a false value to cancel the submission of the form.  REVIEW  In this session, you saw several different techniques for data validation. You learned how to validate data on the fly, as well as how to validate data when the user clicks the Submit button. You saw how programming defensively and using default values could help reduce the amount of data validation you actually have to do. I also showed you how to protect a text field from user input by using an onfocus handler. You even learned how to create a set of custom graphics-based controls that limit the range of user input to a form.  QUIZ YOURSELF  1. Can select lists reduce your data validation chores?

One glaring exception is that if the user leaves the site and returns later, the contents of the shopping cart will be forgotten and the user will  have to make her selections all over again. To fix this, I need some mechanism that will allow the shopping cart to remember its contents and rebuild itself accordingly. Browser cookies were invented to solve exactly this sort of problem.  What Is a Cookie?  A cookie is a tiny chunk of data that the Web browser stores on the client’s machine. When I say “tiny,” I mean about 4 KB  4,096 bytes , though the exact size depends on the browser that’s being used.  Just keep your cookies under 4,000 bytes in length and you shouldn’t have any problems.  While cookies are usually thought of as a strictly client-side affair, they are actually managed by both the Web browser and Web server working together. The Web browser can send  ✔ ✔  4804-2 Ch16.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 188  188  Saturday Afternoon  a cookie to the server, which will store it for later use. Then, when a Web browser requests an HTML document, the server looks at all of the cookies it has available and determines which of these should be sent along with the requested document. These cookies are sent as headers that precede the actual HTML document. As these cookie headers reach the browser, they are parsed and incorporated into the Browser Object Model representation for that HTML document.  As you may remember from Session 9, so far as JavaScript is concerned, a  cookie is just another property of the document object. This makes reading and writing cookies simple:   var theCookie = document.cookie;    read the cookie document.cookie = theCookie;    write the cookie  However, actually using the contents of a cookie can be much trickier. But to understand why, you have to understand how cookies are structured.  Ingredients of a cookie  When you reduce it down to its simplest terms, a cookie is simply a name string, followed by an equal sign, followed by a string that represents the value of the cookie. A semicolon marks the end of this value string. So, the simplest cookie you could cook up might look like this: name=value; The name you give to a cookie can be just about anything. However, it can’t contain white space characters  blank spaces, tabs, and such , commas, or semicolons. The value part of a cookie has the same restrictions.  While cookie names can be just about anything, you’ll probably want to give  your cookie a name that describes exactly what the cookie contains. For example, since my cookie will eventually hold shopping cart information, I might want to call it “bpShopCart”  for “baby-palooza shopping cart”  or something similar. So, without actually knowing what’s in the shopping cart, my basic cookie might look something like this:  bpShopCart=shopcartcontents;  Cookie attributes After the initial name and value pair, you can add any or all of the following four attributes to gain more control over how your cookie will be used.   4804-2 Ch16.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 189  Session 16—Cooking up Cookies with JavaScript   189   cid:2  expires: This attribute is followed by a value that specifies an expiration  date for the cookie. This date tells you when the Web browser should delete the cookie from the client’s machine. If no expiration date is speci- fied, the cookie will be deleted when the user exits the Web browser. I’ll be discussing the expires attribute in much greater detail a bit later in this session.   cid:2  domain: By default, cookies are only available to the HTML documents that are on the same server as the document that created the cookie. For exam- ple, if a cookie is created by a document on the “www.baby-palooza.com” server, that cookie will not be available to a document on the “orders.baby-palooza.com” server. You can change this by adding a domain specification to your cookie:  bpShopcart=shopcartcontents;domain=baby-palooza.com  Here the domain I’ve specified means that this cookie will be made avail- able to any HTML document requested from “www.baby-palooza.com,” “orders.baby-palooza.com,” or any other server in the “baby-palooza.com” domain.   cid:2  path: Normally, a cookie is only available to the HTML documents that are  in the same folder as the document that created the cookie.  In other words, if a cookie is created by a document in the Session16 folder, it isn’t available to a document in the Session15 folder.  However, by adding a path specification to your cookie, you can make it available to the docu- ments in other folders. For example, if I wanted my cookie to be available to all documents in all of the “Session” folders that are at the root of my Web server, I could specify:  bpShopcart=shopcartcontents;path= Session  With this path specification in place, the Web server will supply this cookie along with any HTML document that comes from any root-level folder whose name begins with “Session.”  Note that the path and domain attributes you specify are case sensitive only if your Web server is case sensitive.  If you want your cookie to be sent along with every HTML docu- ment on the server, you would specify a path of  .  Which specifies the root and everything under it!    cid:2  secure: If this attribute is specified, the cookie will only be sent if the client and server are joined by a secure connection  that is, “https” or some other secure connection . bpShopcart=shopcartcontents;secure  S e s s i o n   1 6  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch16.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 190  190  Cookie values  Saturday Afternoon  At this point, you might be thinking that cookies look pretty simple. Well, they are pretty simple. However, I’ve yet to consider what the value of my cookie will actually be. Remember, I’ve got to somehow store the entire contents of my shop- ping cart inside my cookie. How can I do this? Well, I could create a separate cookie for each item in my product inventory and then check each cookie in turn. However, the cookie specification states that no client may store more than 300 cookies total, and that no more than 20 cookies can come from the same domain. So, if my product inventory has more than 20 products, this restriction will make a “one cookie per product” approach unworkable.  A much better approach is to store all of my shopping cart information inside a single cookie. I can accomplish this by encoding the part number and quantity for each item in my shopping cart and placing all of this information into a single value string.  Remember, a cookie value can contain almost anything you wish, with the  exception of white space characters, commas, and semicolons. Fortunately, I don’t need to use any of these characters to create my cookie value.  Of course, if you do ever need to use one of the characters that aren’t allowed in a cookie, you can use the JavaScript escape   function to encode those characters into a form that you can safely keep in a cookie. To decode these characters, you can use the unescape   function to return them to their original state. I’ll be discussing these functions in greater detail in Session 28.  So, what will my cookie actually look like? Consider the following sample cookie:  bpShopCart=3st-0015dp-003;  Given what you know about the way the Baby-Palooza product inventory is set  up, you might be able to discern that, according to this cookie, there are three units of part number st-001 and five units of part number dp-003 in the shopping cart. However, you are only able to make this determination because you are familiar with the way the inventory is set up and because the human brain is the best pattern- matching machine in the known universe. A JavaScript program, on the other hand, will have no earthly idea what this string signifies. Worse yet, it will find it almost impossible to extract any meaningful information from it at all. So, let me refine the design of my cookie so that it’s easier to see how my data is actually arranged:  bpShopCart=3:st-0015:dp-003;  In this version, I’ve added two different separator characters that break up the value in the cookie and give it a bit of structure. The vertical bar  also sometimes called a “pipe”  character is used to separate the information for each product in   4804-2 Ch16.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 191  Session 16—Cooking up Cookies with JavaScript   191  the shopping cart  that is, to separate the diapers from the strollers . Inside each of these divisions, a colon character is used to separate the quantity in the cart from the product number it is applied to. So, with a mere glance, a human can tell that this shopping cart holds three units of part number st-001 and five units of part number dp-003. And, as I’ll show you shortly, it’s now child’s play for a JavaScript program to extract useful information from this cookie.  So, why did I pick the vertical bar and colon characters for my separators?  Honestly, I did it because, for me, they provide the best visual cues as to how this data is arranged. When you design the cookies you’ll be using in your own pro- jects, you can use whatever separator characters you want. The only restrictions are that you can’t use white space characters, commas, or semicolons and that your separators shouldn’t be something that might appear as data inside your cookie.  For example, since my part numbers contain dashes, I wouldn’t want to use a dash for one of my separators.   At this point, it’s important that you realize that the cookie string I’m building here is unique to this shopping cart. In all likelihood, each project that you work on will require a completely different cookie structure  if the project even uses cookies at all . The point of this session is to introduce you to the issues that you will confront when working with cookies, not to make you think that there is only one correct way to build and use them.  Cookie Usage Guidelines  Over the years, cookies have received a fair amount of bad press. This is because several clever companies figured out that, because a cookie can hold just about anything, they could just as easily hold personal information as well as what’s in a shopping cart. This can include credit card numbers, passwords, and, perhaps most disturbing of all, information about a person’s Web browsing habits. When privacy advocates got wind of this, there was a general outcry against the use of cookies. As you might imagine, the ability to use cookies is far too useful to go away com- pletely, so Web browser manufacturers responded by allowing individual users to set up their browsers to notify them when a cookie was being saved or to reject all cookies automatically. This means that, if you build a site that depends on cookies being enabled, you have to be prepared for the inevitable case where a user has turned them off and they simply aren’t available.  As you’ll see a bit later, it’s not that hard to tell if cookies are turned off or not,  but it’s much more difficult to persuade cookie-haters to even use your site. Your best bet is to tell visitors that you are using cookies and explain to them exactly what you are tracking with those cookies. This can usually be accomplished with a  S e s s i o n   1 6  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch16.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 192  192  Saturday Afternoon  simple disclaimer or privacy guidelines information page. If, after reading your dis- claimer the user still doesn’t want your cookies on her machine, there’s very little you can do about it. While this may be a victory for privacy advocates, it can be a real pain for the JavaScript programmer. If cookies aren’t available, you can either lock the user out of your site  which is not the best way to keep a customer if you are building an online business  or you can provide the user with as much func- tionality as possible without using cookies.  For the Baby-Palooza site, I’ll be try- ing to provide my users with as much functionality as possible.   Building and Saving Cookies  As you’ve seen, the act of saving a cookie is really very simple. All you have to do is build your cookie string and then issue a statement similar to this:  document.cookie = theCookie;  The tricky part is the actual building of the cookie string. However, once you’ve decided what your cookie value will actually look like, this isn’t too difficult to do. As you’ll remember from earlier in this session, my cookie string is going to look like this:  bpShopCart=quantity:partNumberquantity:partNumberetc. . .;  So, really, all I need is a simple loop that will go through my product informa- tion array and add each product’s information to my final cookie string. Here is a simple function that will do the job quite nicely.  function saveCart   {  var theCookieName = “bpShopCart=”; var theCookieValue = “”; for  x=0; x<productInfo.length; x++  {    Only include if this item has     been placed in the shopping cart if  productInfo[x][5] > 0  {     if this is the first item we’ve found    do not add a separator if  theCookieValue != “”  { theCookieValue += “”; }     add the quantity to the cookie theCookieValue += productInfo[x][5] + “:”;   4804-2 Ch16.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 193  Session 16—Cooking up Cookies with JavaScript   193     add the part number to the cookie theCookieValue += productInfo[x][2]; }  }  document.cookie = theCookieName + theCookieValue + “;”; alert  document.cookie ; }  As you can see, this code isn’t terribly complex. I’m simply moving through my product information array and, if a product has been placed in the shopping cart, I add its information to my cookie value string. After I’ve built my cookie value, I simply concatenate it with the cookie’s name and a semicolon and assign it to the document.cookie property. The call to the alert   method simply allows me to check the contents of my cookie so I can tell if I’ve built it properly.  At this point, the question becomes, “When do I build and save my cookie?”  Well, if you glance back at Session 10, you might notice an event called the onun- load event. This event is fired whenever the browser unloads the current Web page. This happens when the user moves to another page, or when the Reload button is clicked. You trap the onunload event by specifying your handler in the   tag of your HTML document. So, if I change my   tag to look like this:     The saveCart   function will be called whenever the page containing my shop- ping cart is unloaded. So, if I place three strollers and two rattles in my shopping cart and then reload the page, I’ll get an alert window with a cookie string that looks like this:  bpShopCart=3:st-0012:rt-001.  Hopefully, this is almost exactly what you expected the cookie to look like. However, if you look closely, you’ll notice something missing: the ending semi- colon. Even though the saveCart   function adds a semicolon to the end of the cookie when it saves it, that semicolon is not a part of the cookie string that you get when you later examine the document.cookie property. While this might be unexpected, it actually makes processing cookies easier, simply because you don’t have to worry about stripping off the semicolon.  Adding an expiration date  As it stands now, my cookie is ready to use. However, one little thing is missing: an expiration date. Without an expiration date, this cookie will only exist for as  S e s s i o n   1 6  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch16.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 194  194  Saturday Afternoon  long as the user has her Web browser open. This is because, as I mentioned earlier, a cookie saved without an expiration date will be deleted as soon as the user ends her browser session.  You see, when you close your Web browser, part of its shutdown process is to  look at the expiration dates of all of the cookies it has gathered. If the expiration date of a cookie has passed, or if the cookie simply doesn’t have an expiration date, the browser will delete the cookie from the client’s machine. So, in its cur- rent form, my cookie will only be good until the user closes her Web browser. While this might sound good enough, consider the poor user that spends an hour shopping at your site, filling her cart with all sorts of goodies, only to realize that her credit card has expired. Having renewed her credit card a few days later, she returns to your site only to find that everything she has selected has disappeared! How likely is she to repeat all of that work just to give you money?  Again, you specify a cookie expiration date by adding an expires= attribute to the end of your cookie. This will give you a cookie that looks something like this:  bpShopCart=shopcartcontents;expires=expirationdate;  The catch here is that you have to format the expiration date in a very specific way. Fortunately, JavaScript contains an object that makes creating a properly for- matted expiration date very simple.  Using the Date object with a cookie  As the name suggests, the JavaScript Date object is used to hold information about a date. As with the other built-in JavaScript objects you’ve seen, you create a new Date object by using the new keyword, like this: var currentDate = new Date  ; In this example, I’ve not passed any parameters to the Date constructor method. Because of this, the constructor will return a Date object that contains information about the current time and date that are contained in the client’s system clock. Once you’ve got a Date object created, there are lots of different things you can do with it. However, at this point, I’m only interested in using it to create an expira- tion date for my cookie.  I’ll be discussing the Date object in detail in Session 27. For now, I’m just going to discuss the parts of the Date object that are useful for the creation of cookies.   I can do this by adding a time interval to my Date object and then using the  resulting date to tack an expiration date onto the end of my cookie. For example, if I want my cookie to expire in two weeks, I create a Date object representing the cur- rent time, add two weeks to that, and then use this new date  which is two weeks into the future  to generate the expiration date for my cookie. In order to accom- plish this, you need to know about three methods of the JavaScript Date object.   4804-2 Ch16.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 195  Session 16—Cooking up Cookies with JavaScript   195   cid:2  The getTime   method. This method returns the date as the number of  milliseconds that have passed since midnight on January 1, 1970.   cid:2  The setTime   method. This method accepts a single parameter: an inte- ger number of milliseconds that have passed since midnight on January 1, 1970. This number will be used to reset the Date object to that date.   cid:2  The toGMTString   Method. A cookie’s expiration date must follow a cer- tain format. Specifically, it must be formatted as a Greenwich Mean Time  GMT  date string. This method returns the contents of a Date object in exactly that format.  Now that you know about these methods of the Date object, take a look at the  revised saveCart   function.  function saveCart   {  var theCookieName = “bpShopCart=”; var theCookieValue = “”; for  x=0; x<productInfo.length; x++  {    Only include if this item has     been placed in the shopping cart if  productInfo[x][5] > 0  {     if this is the first item we’ve found    do not add a separator if  theCookieValue != “”  { theCookieValue += “”; }     add the quantity to the cookie theCookieValue += productInfo[x][5] + “:”;    add the part number to the cookie theCookieValue += productInfo[x][2]; }  } var expireTime = new Date  ;    add the expiration date     How many milliseconds are there in two weeks? var twoWeeks = 14 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; expireTime.setTime  expireTime.getTime   + twoWeeks ; document.cookie = theCookieName + theCookieValue + “;expires=”  + expireTime.toGMTString   + “;”; alert  document.cookie ; }  S e s s i o n   1 6  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch16.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 196  196  Saturday Afternoon  As you can see, there really isn’t that much to this. The first new step is to cre- ate a Date object that contains the current time and date from the client’s system clock. After this, a simple calculation yields the number of milliseconds that make up a two-week interval.  Remember, there are 1,000 milliseconds in a second.  I then use the getTime   method to extract the number of milliseconds that consti- tute the current date and add my two week interval to that. I then pass this result to the setTime   method and my expireTime Date object will then contain a date that is two weeks into the future.  The only thing left to do is extract this information in the form of a GMT for- matted string and add it onto the end of my cookie string. When it’s all over, the cookie string that’s generated might look something like this:  bpShopCart=2:rt-001;expires=Tue, 12 Dec 2000 19:38:17 UTC;  Loading and Decoding Cookies  Now that I’ve got my cookie saved out and I know that it’s going to be around for a while, I have to turn my attention to loading it back in when the user returns to my site.  As you’ve probably guessed, if the onunload event is a good time for saving a cookie, the onload event is a perfect signal for loading a cookie back in. If you’ll remember, loading the actual cookie is a snap: var theCookie = document. cookie;  As with saving a cookie, the real work comes from decoding the information  that is contained in the value portion of the cookie string. Fortunately, the Array and String handling methods you saw in Session 5 and Session 6 make this very easy to do.  function loadCart   {  var myCookieName = “bpShopCart”; var theCookie = document.cookie;    Remember, there can be multiple name=value pairs!    So, break the cookie up along the semi-colons  var allCookies = theCookie.split  “;” ;     Now, take each of those name=value pairs and split them for  a=0; a<allCookies.length; a++  {  var thisCookie = allCookies[a].split  “=” ;    Does the name in this cookie match? if  thisCookie[0] == myCookieName  {   4804-2 Ch16.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 197  Session 16—Cooking up Cookies with JavaScript   197     break out the products in the cart if  thisCookie.length > 1  {  var products = thisCookie[1].split  “” ; if  products.length > 0  {     Split out the part numbers and quantities     for each product for  b=0; b<products.length; b++  {  var detailInfo = products[b].split  “:” ;    Store the new value in the     on-screen text box document.cart.elements[ ‘inCart_’ +   detailInfo[1]].value = detailInfo[0];     Finally, use the enterQuantity function    to validate the value and update the     main productInfo array enterQuantity  detailInfo[1] ; }  } else {     If there is nothing in the cookie,     do nothing break; }  S e s s i o n   1 6  P a r t   I I I  —  S a t u r d a y   A f t e r n o o n  }  }  }  }  As you can see, I’m using the String object’s split   method to break the  cookie apart into smaller and smaller units of information. The first call to split   breaks up any name=value pairs that are in the cookie. I then loop through these pairs and use a second call to split   to break them into their con- stituent parts  that is, the name and the value . I then search each pair for the name I used for my cookie  “bpShopCart” .  If the names match, and the cookie is not empty, I know that this is the value I’m interested in. So, I then split that value into yet another array that contains the information about all of the products that were in my shopping cart when the cookie was saved. One last loop splits each chunk of product information into an array containing the part number and quantity.   4804-2 Ch16.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 198  198  Saturday Afternoon  At this point, it’s a simple matter to assign the quantity to the appropriate text  box on screen. A final call to the enterQuantity   function ensures that the value is valid and updates the values in the actual productInfo array. With all of this code in place, my shopping cart will automatically rebuild itself whenever the user returns to it.  As long as they come back within two weeks!   Deleting a Cookie  While it’s nice to be able to make cookies hang around, there are times when you want to get rid of them completely. One such time might be when the user actually places an order. After all, once they’ve ordered the products in their shopping cart, they’ll hardly want to see those items pop up in their cart again.  The only way to really delete a cookie is to save a cookie with the same name,  but with an empty value and no expiration date. This will force the browser to delete the cookie when the user finishes using the Web browser. For the Baby- Palooza site, this can be accomplished fairly simply. All I need to do is create a new global variable called clearCookie. Then, when the order form is successfully submitted, clearCookie will be set to true. All that remains is to modify the last few lines of the saveCart   function to look like this:  if  clearCookie  {  document.cookie = theCookieName + “;expires=;”; } else {  document.cookie = theCookieName + theCookieValue +  “;expires=” + expireTime.toGMTString   + “;”; }  Telling if Cookies Are Turned Off  Finally, I need to address how you can determine if cookies have been disabled in the user’s browser. In the case of the shopping cart I’ve been building here, not having access to cookies really won’t be that much of a tragedy. If the user leaves or resets the page with the shopping cart on it, she’ll simply lose all of the items she had previously added to her cart. While this isn’t that big a deal for the Baby- Palooza site, it can be a real headache for some other sites. So, it’s a good idea to have a way to determine if cookies are available or not. The function shown here can do just that:   4804-2 Ch16.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 199  Session 16—Cooking up Cookies with JavaScript   199  function cookiesActive   {  var result = false; if  document.cookie != “”  {   Handle the simple case first  result = true; } else {  document.cookie = “active=yes;”;     Try to save and reload it if  document.cookie == “active=yes”  { result = true;    now trash it... document.cookie = “active=;expires=;”; }  }  return result; }  As you can see, this function takes a very simple approach to the problem. If  the document.cookie property is not empty, cookies must be active. If it is empty, it checks to see if it can save and reload a simple cookie. If it can, cookies are active. If not, cookies must be turned off. That’s about all there is to it!  If your browser is Internet Explorer version 5 or Netscape Navigator version 6, you can also check the navigator. cookieEnabled property. You’ll learn more about this property in Session 26.  Tip  REVIEW  In this session, you learned all about cookies and how they can be used from JavaScript. You learned that cookies are stored as name=value pairs. You also found out about the four cookie attributes that you can specify  expires, domain, path, and secure  for your cookies. You learned how to use the value portion of a cookie to store multiple chunks of information, rather than breaking that informa- tion up among multiple cookies. I also told you about some of the privacy concerns surrounding cookies and how you might address those on your Web site. You learned how to use the onunload and onload events to trigger the saving and loading of cookie information. I showed you how to build a cookie complete with an expiration date  using the JavaScript Date object . You also saw how to delete a cookie and how to determine if cookies are active in the client browser.

You might have noticed that a “Grand Total” text box appeared on the  baby-palooza.com Web site in Session 15. However, no code was added to actually place a grand total here. Take the final source code from Session 16 and update it to calculate and display the grand total whenever the user changes a quantity elsewhere in the shopping cart. Also, be sure to protect the grand total text box so that the user cannot type anything into it.  Note that when you have this code completed, you might find that the values calculated for the grand total contain more decimal places than you expect. You’ll learn how to solve this problem in Session 25.    4804-2 Pt04.F  4 9 01  8:15 AM  Page 204  P A R T  IV  Saturday Evening  Session 17 Understanding JavaScript Objects Session 18 Creating and Using Methods Session 19 Enhancing HTML with JavaScript Objects Session 20 Dynamically Creating and Executing JavaScript   4804-2 Ch17.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 205  S E S S I O N  17  Understanding JavaScript Objects  Session Checklist  Learning how to create your own objects  ✔ Understanding constructor functions  Learning how to define properties for your objects  ✔ Understanding what “this” is  A s of this moment, you’ve actually seen everything you need to create a  JavaScript-based Web site. However, if you want to tap the real power of JavaScript, you need to learn how to create and use your own JavaScript  objects.  What Is an Object?  I’ve been throwing around the word “object” for quite a while now, but I’ve not yet really explained what an object is. Of course, you know what an object is in the real world: It’s simply something that is an entity unto itself. For example, a golf ball is an object, as is a human being.  ✔ ✔  4804-2 Ch17.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 206  206  Saturday Evening  In the real world, objects have physical properties as well as actions that can be  performed by, on, or with them. A golf ball, for example, has physical properties including its size  4.27 centimeters in diameter , its shape  the good ones are usu- ally spherical , and its texture  it’s got all those cute dimples . There are lots of things you can do with golf balls too: You can roll them, bounce them, or even play golf with them.  One interesting thing about real world objects is that they can contain other objects. A golf ball contains a rubber ball surrounded by a tightly wound rubber band.  Well, that’s what was in the one my grandfather cut open when I was seven!  Each of these is an object in its own right, but they’ve been packaged together to create a new type of object.  Computer-based objects are very similar in concept. The main difference is that  instead of dealing with chunks of physical matter, computer objects deal with chunks of computer data. So, computer-based objects have properties as well as a set of actions that they can perform.  As you’ve guessed by now, these actions are called methods for a computer-based object.  Finally, as with real-world objects, computer-based objects can be combined to create completely new types of objects.  You’ve seen examples of each of these things throughout the first half of this  book. For example, a JavaScript String object has a length property that tells you how many characters are in the string. It also has lots of different methods  actions  that it can perform. For example, the toUpperCase   method will return all of the characters in the string in their uppercase equivalents.  You’ve also seen how objects can be combined to create totally new entities. For  example, the document object is just a collection of a bunch of different types of objects — forms, controls, a few strings — each with its own set of properties and methods. All of these objects work together to create something much more inter- esting and useful.  Compare this to, say, a human being from the real world. A human being is  really just a collection of objects — kidneys, lungs, the odd brain or two — each with its own properties and “methods,” all working together to create something much more interesting and useful.  Why Bother Creating Your Own Objects?  At the start of this session, I mentioned that you know all you need to know to create a JavaScript-based Web site. So, why should you even bother learning how to create and use objects? Actually, for most Web sites, you won’t need to use objects  other than the ones that are built into JavaScript  at all! However, as you’ll see in the next few sessions, you’ll need to use objects if you want to build really cool, complex, and useful Web sites.   4804-2 Ch17.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 207  Session 17—Understanding JavaScript Objects  207  Of course, there are other reasons to use objects. One of the best is reusability. When you define a new type of object, you end up with a complete, self-contained entity that describes the properties and methods of a particular type of data.  This is called encapsulation.  You can then take that object definition and drop it into any new project that you work on. This is much nicer than having to rebuild every- thing from scratch.  If you don’t think reusability is a big deal, just ask your doctor which would be easier: transplanting a kidney or building a new one from scratch.   Imagine if you will, a shopping cart object. Now imagine that your quite-mad  employer has ordered you to put together 50 e-commerce sites. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could take your shopping cart object and reuse it in each site with almost no modification?  How to Define and Create JavaScript Objects  Every programming language that supports objects has a slightly different way of creating those objects. However, those differences are usually just a matter of syn- tax; the steps you go through are almost always exactly the same.  The first thing you have to do is decide what type of data your object will repre- sent. Is it a string, an array, or a sales detail? For the purposes of this discussion, I’ll be defining an object to represent an individual product in my product information array.  Next, you have to decide what kinds of properties and methods your object  should have. To do this, stop and think about the data you are trying to encapsu- late in your object. What sorts of information will you need to store in the object? What sorts of actions do you need to be able to perform on that data?  Once you’ve got all of this nailed down, you can begin to write the program  code that will actually define your object. In JavaScript you do this by defining a constructor function along with one or more functions that will implement the methods of your object.  I’ve already got a definition for a product information array, which looks like this:  First slot = Price Second slot = Description Third slot = Part Number Fourth slot = Shipping cost Fifth slot = Quantity on Hand Sixth slot = Quantity Ordered  With this definition in place, I was able to write a bunch of assignment statements that created a product information array. Like this:  S e s s i o n   1 7  P a r t   I V —  S a t u r d a y   E v e n i n g   4804-2 Ch17.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 208  208  Saturday Evening  var index = 0; var strollerInfo = new Array  ; strollerInfo[index++] = 199.95; strollerInfo[index++] = “Rock & Stroll - Deluxe”; strollerInfo[index++] = “st-001”; strollerInfo[index++] = 20; strollerInfo[index++] = 5; strollerInfo[index++] = 0;  This is pretty simple, but it does mean that I have to repeat the same basic  statements over and over again for each product in my inventory.  See the discus- sion in Session 6 for a reminder of just how much code this is.   The question then is how do I rework this as an object? Well, first I need to cre-  ate a constructor function, like this one:  function itemInfo  oPrice, oDesc, oPartNum, oShipping, oInStock  {  this.price = oPrice; this.description = oDesc; this.partNumber = oPartNum; this.shipping = oShipping; this.inStock = oInStock; this.inCart = 0; }  As you look at this listing, I’m pretty sure you’re wondering what the heck this is. Before I address that question, let me point out a few other things. First of all, notice that this constructor function is defined using the function keyword that you are already familiar with. In JavaScript, constructor functions are defined almost exactly like other functions. The main difference is how and when they are used. Specifically, they are only used to create new objects; you don’t call them for any other reason.  Second, just like a regular function, you can pass parameters to constructor  functions. These parameters can be used for anything you like, but the most com- mon use is to pass default or original values that you want placed into your object when it is first created. In the itemInfo constructor, I’m allowing the passage of parameters that will specify the original price, description, and so forth for the product I want to store information about.   4804-2 Ch17.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 209  Session 17—Understanding JavaScript Objects  209  What the heck is this?  Which brings us neatly to the subject of the this keyword. In the simplest terms, whenever you see the this keyword, it is referring to the current object. So, what is this doing in a constructor function?  To answer that, remember what a constructor function does: It actually builds an object and fills it with data. Now, if you are in the middle of constructing an object, that object won’t actually have a name yet, so the JavaScript interpreter needs some way to differentiate it from any other objects that might be floating around in memory. The this keyword is just what the doctor ordered: When used inside a constructor function, it refers to the object that is being built right at that moment.  Note that you can use the this keyword outside of constructor functions. It’s a very handy keyword!   How is an object constructed?  Now that I have my constructor function, let me show you how it’s used. With this constructor function in place, instead of coding this:  var index = 0; var strollerInfo = new Array  ; strollerInfo[index++] = 199.95; strollerInfo[index++] = “Rock & Stroll - Deluxe”; strollerInfo[index++] = “st-001”; strollerInfo[index++] = 20; strollerInfo[index++] = 5; strollerInfo[index++] = 0;  I can now code this:  function itemInfo  oPrice, oDesc, oPartNum, oShipping, oInStock  {  this.price = oPrice; this.description = oDesc; this.partNumber = oPartNum; this.shipping = oShipping; this.inStock = oInStock; this.inCart = 0; }  var strollerInfo = new itemInfo  199.95, “Rock & Stroll – Deluxe”, “st-001”, 20, 5 ;  S e s s i o n   1 7  P a r t   I V —  S a t u r d a y   E v e n i n g   4804-2 Ch17.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 210  210  Saturday Evening  So, what’s going on here? Well, as with the array-based version, I’m using the  new keyword to invoke a constructor function. In this case however, I’m invoking a constructor that I’ve written myself  the itemInfo   constructor function  and not one that’s built into the JavaScript interpreter.  When the constructor function is invoked, it’s passed five parameters. The first of these parameters goes into the parameter variable named oPrice. Then the fol- lowing statement is executed: this.price = oPrice;  Remember, at this point, the JavaScript interpreter is in the middle of creating  a new object. Given that circumstance, this statement tells the JavaScript inter- preter that this new object should have a property named “price.” Furthermore, the value of the price property should be the value that was passed via the oPrice parameter. So, since it’s being executed in the context of object creation, this statement actually does a couple of things:  cid:2  It creates a property in the new object.  cid:2  It assigns an initial value to the newly created property.  When the constructor finishes, you’ll have a new object stored in the  strollerInfo variable. That object will have the structure and contents shown in Table 17-1.  Table 17-1 Contents of the strollerInfo Object  Property Name price  description  partNumber  shipping  inStock  inCart  Value 199.95  “st-001”  20  5  0  “Rock & Stroll – Deluxe”  One thing to note here is that I didn’t use a parameter value to fill in my  inCart property. Instead I simply assigned it a default value that makes sense.  After all, when my shopping cart is first created, it will be empty.  Again, con- structor functions are, at heart, functions. This means that you can make them as   4804-2 Ch17.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 211  Session 17—Understanding JavaScript Objects  211  complex or as simple as you like. Just remember: The purpose of a constructor function is to create a new object, not to make something happen elsewhere in your program.  At this point, you might be wondering how to define the methods that belong to this object. It isn’t that hard to do, but, because it is a bit more complex than defining properties, I’m going to leave the discussion of how to define and use methods until the next session.  So, with that said, I can now replace my product information arrays with objects, as shown by the following code:  var strollerInfo = new itemInfo  199.95, “Rock & Stroll - Deluxe”, “st-001”, 20, 5 ; var diaperInfo = new itemInfo  13.95, “Size 3, Extra Absorbent”, “dp-003”, 5, 100 ; var carSeatInfo = new itemInfo  149.95, “Ultra-Safe, Rear-Facing”, “cs-001”, 15, 5 ; var rattleInfo = new itemInfo  4.95, “UberNoise 5000”, “rt-001”, 5, 155 ; var babyWipeInfo = new itemInfo  9.95, “Clean and Fragrant”, “bw- 001”, 6, 75 ;  Tip  You might have heard other programmers use the terms class and instance when talking about objects. What do these terms mean? Well, when the above code finishes executing, I’ll have five dif- ferent objects, each of which holds information about a different product in my inventory. However, since each object was created by the same constructor function, they are all said to be of the same class, specifically, the itemInfo class.  A class gets its name from its constructor function.  Each individual object, however, is called an instance of that class. In the real world, a class could be thought of as a group of people, for example, American citizens. An instance of that class of people would be an individual citizen, like the former American president Gerald Ford.  When this code has executed, I’ll have five itemInfo objects. Each of these will have exactly the same properties, but the values in those properties will be differ- ent, depending on the values I passed to the constructor function. Table 17-2 shows exactly what I mean.  S e s s i o n   1 7  P a r t   I V —  S a t u r d a y   E v e n i n g   4804-2 Ch17.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 212  212  Saturday Evening  Table 17-2 Contents of the Five itemInfo Objects  Object  Properties price  strollerInfo diaperInfo carSeatInfo rattleInfo 199.95  149.95  13.95  4.95  babyWipeInfo 9.95  description “Rock &  Stroll –  Deluxe”  “Size 3, Extra  Absorbent”  “Ultra-Safe, Rear-Facing” 5000”  “UberNoise “Clean and   Fragrant”  partNumber “st-001”  “dp-003”  “cs-001”  “rt-001”  “bw-001”  shipping  inStock  inCart  20  5  0  5  0  100  15  5  0  5  0  155  6  75  0  Using the Objects You Create  Now, if I simply leave my code in this state, I’ve got a big problem: Every bit of the code I’ve created so far has used arrays to manipulate my product information. Of course, I’m still going to need an easy way to loop through all of my inventory items, so it’s probably a good idea to leave the main productInfo array as it is for now. This means that the following code can stay exactly the way it is:  index = 0; var productInfo = new Array  ; productInfo[index++] = strollerInfo; productInfo[index++] = diaperInfo; productInfo[index++] = carSeatInfo; productInfo[index++] = rattleInfo; productInfo[index++] = babyWipeInfo;  What remains then, is to change all of the functions that treat productInfo as if it was a multidimensional array. One such function is the function you wrote to calculate the grand total of everything in the shopping cart.  You wrote this func- tion as the answer to one of the Saturday Afternoon Part Review questions.  My version is shown here:   4804-2 Ch17.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 213  Session 17—Understanding JavaScript Objects  213  function calcGrandTotal   {  var grandTotal = 0; for  x=0; x<productInfo.length; x++  {     Are there any of this item in the cart? if  productInfo[x][5] > 0  {  grandTotal += calcFinalCost  productInfo[x][0],  productInfo[x][3]  * productInfo[x][5]; }  }  }  document.cart.elements[‘grandTotal’].value = grandTotal; }  So, what I’ve got to do here is rewrite this, and the other functions in  babyPalooza.js so that they no longer try to access a second dimension in the productInfo array. There are a lot of functions to consider in the babyPalooza.js file, but the approach to fixing each one is pretty much the same, so I’ll just go over the changes that are required for the calcGrandTotal   function.  function calcGrandTotal   {  var grandTotal = 0; for  x=0; x<productInfo.length; x++  {  var thisItem = productInfo[x];    Are there any of this item in the cart? if  thisItem.inCart > 0  {  grandTotal += calcFinalCost  thisItem.price,  thisItem.shipping  * thisItem.inCart; }  document.cart.elements[‘grandTotal’].value = grandTotal; }  As you can see, this isn’t too different from the previous version. The main dif- ference is that as I move through the productInfo array, I extract the itemInfo object and place it in a local variable called thisItem. Like this: var thisItem = productInfo[x]; I can then access the appropriate properties in the object to carry out the needed calculations. Like so:  grandTotal += calcFinalCost  thisItem.price, thisItem.shipping  * thisItem.inCart;  As another example, let’s see how the findPartNo   and doPlus   functions  look like after they’ve been changed to support objects.   S e s s i o n   1 7  P a r t   I V —  S a t u r d a y   E v e n i n g   4804-2 Ch17.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 214  214  Saturday Evening  function findPartNo  partNo  {  var result = “”; for  x=0; x < productInfo.length; x++  {  var thisItem = productInfo[x]; if  thisItem.partNumber == partNo  {  result = thisItem; break; }  }  return result; }      function doPlus  partNo  {  var prodInfo = findPartNo  partNo ;    Do we have enough on hand to do this? if  prodInfo.inStock > 0  {     Update the quantities in the array prodInfo.inStock--; prodInfo.inCart++;    Copy these new values to the form document.cart.elements[ “quan_” + partNo].value =  prodInfo.inStock; document.cart.elements[ “inCart_” + partNo].value =  prodInfo.inCart; calcGrandTotal   } else {  alert  “There are no more of this item in stock!” ; }  }  As you can see, there really isn’t that big a difference here. All I’ve done is  switch from array slot numbers to object property names.  To compare these new functions with their old counterparts, see the babyPalooza.js file in the Session16 folder on your CD-ROM.  You should find that the baby-palooza.com site behaves exactly the same way as it did before.  For a challenge, take the code from the PartReview03 folder and change it to use objects. Be sure not to cheat by looking at the code in the Session17 folder!    4804-2 Ch17.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 215  Session 17—Understanding JavaScript Objects  215  REVIEW  In this session, you learned the basics of creating your own JavaScript objects. You learned what objects are and how they have many of the same qualities as objects from the real world. You learned how to create a simple constructor function and how to call it to create a new object. You also learned about the this keyword and saw how it is used in a constructor function.  Don’t worry, I’ll be telling you how to use this in other places in upcoming sessions.  Finally, you saw how to use the objects you create in your JavaScript code. Of course, at this point, I really haven’t shown you much to recommend objects over arrays. I’ll be taking care of this in the next session when I show you how to define and use methods with your objects.  QUIZ YOURSELF  1.

However, really simple objects that just have properties in them  like the itemInfo object from the last session  don’t really give  you all that much bang for your buck. Objects become really interesting and much more useful, when you add methods to them.  What Is a Method?  As I said earlier, a method is sort of like a function that belongs to an object. Actually, methods belong to an entire class of objects. For example, every object that’s a member of a String class has a toUpperCase   method. So, it’s a bit more precise to say that a method is a function that belongs to an entire class of objects.  The upshot of this is that — as with properties — when you define a new class   by creating a constructor function , any methods that you define in your class will be available to each and every object that you create with that constructor function.   4804-2 Ch18.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 218  218  Defining a method  Saturday Evening  In JavaScript, adding a method to a class is a two-part process.  cid:2  Define the method in the constructor function. This requires a single line of code. In this line of code, you give the method a name, and you associ- ate it with a function that will actually carry out the processes of the method.   cid:2  Write the function that implements the method. When you call a method, an actual JavaScript function is executed. The catch is, when you create your own objects, you have to write these functions yourself. Fortunately, these functions are just like every other function you’ve seen so far. The only difference is that you should never execute them directly; they should only be called as a result of a method being called.   If this is a bit confusing, don’t worry. It should become clear once you see an  example.  But, before I can show you an example, I need to back up a bit and decide  exactly what I want to write a method for. To do this, I’ll return to the itemInfo object I defined in the last session and see if it could benefit from a method or two.  Well, what are some operations that might make sense for this type of object?  Looking at the source code I’ve written so far, I can see that the calcFinalCost   function is an ideal candidate for being turned into a method for this class of objects. Here’s the code for calcFinalCost   as it appeared the last time you saw it:  function calcFinalCost  baseCost, shippingCost  {  return baseCost + shippingCost; }  As you can see, this is a very simple function. It takes two numbers as parame-  ters and returns the sum of those numbers. While it’s a fairly simple function, using it is a bit more complex than it would be if it were a method of the itemInfo class. For example, consider the original source code for the calcGrandTotal   function:  function calcGrandTotal   {  var grandTotal = 0; for  x=0; x<productInfo.length; x++  {  var thisItem = productInfo[x];    Are there any of this item in the cart? if  thisItem.inCart > 0  {  grandTotal += calcFinalCost  thisItem.price,   4804-2 Ch18.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 219  Session 18—Creating and Using Methods  219  thisItem.shipping  * thisItem.inCart; }  }  document.cart.elements[‘grandTotal’].value = grandTotal; }  Looking at this, you might be wondering how in the world this could be any simpler. Well, notice that in order to call calcFinalCost  , I actually have to extract the price and shipping properties from the itemInfo object I’m working with. As you’ll see in a moment, by reworking calcFinalCost   as a method, I can get rid of these two steps completely!  Specifying a method in a constructor function Now that I’ve decided what to turn into a method, I can show you how to actually do it. First, I have to modify the itemInfo constructor function to actually define the method. This is shown in my updated itemInfo constructor.  function itemInfo  oPrice, oDesc, oPartNum, oShipping, oInStock  {  this.price = oPrice; this.description = oDesc; this.partNumber = oPartNum; this.shipping = oShipping; this.inStock = oInStock; this.inCart = 0; this.calcFinalCost = itemInfo_doCalcFinalCost; }  In the new version of the itemInfo constructor function, only one thing has  changed: I’ve added the following statement to the end of the function.  this.calcFinalCost = itemInfo_doCalcFinalCost;  The left hand side of this statement works exactly like the statements above it. It tells the JavaScript interpreter that, for this object that is being created right now, I want to add a new slot that goes by the name “calcFinalCost.”  What then, differentiates this from the definition of a property? Well, it’s  what’s on the right hand side of the statement that does the trick. The right hand side of this statement is the name “itemInfo_doCalcFinalCost.” Now, since this isn’t the name of a local or global variable, and it isn’t a numeric value or a quoted string, the JavaScript interpreter realizes that it must be something else. It is, in fact, the name of the function that will be used to implement the method whose name is given on the left hand side of the statement.  S e s s i o n   1 8  P a r t   I V —  S a t u r d a y   E v e n i n g   4804-2 Ch18.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 220  220  Saturday Evening  To put it another way, this line tells the JavaScript interpreter that every object  created by this constructor function will have a method named “calcFinalCost.” But, whenever the calcFinalCost   method is called, the JavaScript interpreter should actually execute the function named “itemInfo_doCalcFinalCost.”  So, to sum up, the name on the left-hand side of the statement is the name I want to give my method, but the name on the right-hand side of the statement is the name of the function that will actually be executed when the method is called.  Technical types like to say that the function implements the method.   Once again, there isn’t anything magical about the names I’m using. I’ve simply  adopted a standard way of naming methods and the functions that implement them. Specifically, I always prefix my implementation functions with the name of the class they belong to, followed by an underscore and the characters do. This lets me quickly see which functions are actually method implementation functions and which class they belong to. If you like, you can give your method implementation functions any valid function name you like. Lot’s of programmers actually use the same name for the method and the implementation function. This is perfectly fine, but it can lead to some confusion when you revisit your source code a few months later.  Writing a function to implement a method With my method defined in my constructor function, I need to actually create the function that will implement the method. Fortunately, in this case, all I have to do is rename and tweak the calcFinalCost   function, as shown here:  function itemInfo_doCalcFinalCost   { return this.price + this.shipping; }  As you can see, the only things that have changed here are the name of the  function and the fact that the this keyword now appears in the function. Why is this necessary? Well, remember that this method will be accessible from any object that is created by the itemInfo constructor function. Because of this, the method needs some way to determine which price property and which shipping property to use. Here again, the this keyword tells the method to use the proper- ties that belong to the current object. Of course, that begs the question, “How does an object become the ‘current’ object?”  Assuming that the method definitions you’ve just seen are in effect, consider  the following code:  var strollerInfo = new itemInfo  199.95, “Rock & Stroll – Deluxe”, “st-001”, 20, 5 ;   4804-2 Ch18.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 221  Session 18—Creating and Using Methods  221  var diaperInfo = new itemInfo  13.95, “Size 3, Extra Absorbent”, “dp-003”, 5, 100 ;  var strollPrice = strollerInfo.calcFinalCost  ; var diaperPrice = diaperInfo.calcFinalCost  ;  In this example I’ve created two new itemInfo objects: strollerInfo and  diaperInfo. I then proceed to call the caclFinalCost   method for each object. Now, when I call the method, I have to give the name of the object along with the name of the method. The simple act of naming the object along with the method tells the JavaScript interpreter which object should be used when the this key- word is encountered in the method. Neat, eh?  Using a custom method in your program Now that my method and its implementation function are defined, the last thing I need to do is change the other code in my program so that any calls to the old calcFinalCost   function become calls to the calcFinalCost   method.  There are actually two or three places where this happens, so I’m just going to show you the changes in the calcGrandTotal   function.   function calcGrandTotal   {  var grandTotal = 0; for  x=0; x<productInfo.length; x++  {  var thisItem = productInfo[x];    Are there any of this item in the cart? if  thisItem.inCart > 0  {  grandTotal += thisItem.calcFinalCost   *  thisItem.inCart; }  }  document.cart.elements[‘grandTotal’].value = grandTotal; }  As you can see, this actually makes my code a bit smaller and a lot simpler!  When I say “simpler,” I don’t just mean that it’s easier to type; I’m also talking about maintenance and adding functionality in the future. In this example I only have to change my code in two or three places. But, what if the actual math required for calculating the final cost had changed?  For example, what if sales tax became a consideration?  Using the old setup, I might have to change each and every call to the calcFinalCost   function  perhaps to include a third or fourth parameter . However, by using the object and method approach, I only have to change the code in one place: the implementation function.  S e s s i o n   1 8  P a r t   I V —  S a t u r d a y   E v e n i n g   4804-2 Ch18.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 222  222  Saturday Evening  No parameters required  Looking at my new itemInfo constructor, you might have noticed that when I defined my method I didn’t specify any parameters.  this.calcFinalCost = itemInfo_doCalcFinalCost;  This isn’t because the itemInfo_doCalcFinalCost   function doesn’t take any  parameters, it’s because you simply aren’t allowed to list parameters  or even an empty set of parentheses  when you define a method. As with every other JavaScript function you create, the functions that implement your methods can accept as few or as many parameters as you want. You just can’t list them inside your constructor function.  Implementing the Inventory as an Object  Since practice makes perfect, let me walk you through the process of reworking the inventory as an object. Basically, I want to take the productInfo array that I’ve been using, and make it part of a larger object that handles all of my inven- tory-related tasks. As things stand right now, those tasks include finding items in the inventory, adding items to the inventory, and adding and subtracting units to and from the inventory. As before, my first step is to create a constructor function for my new inventory class.   function inventory   {  this.productList = new Array  ; this.addInventoryItem = inventory_doAddInventoryItem; this.findPartNo = inventory_doFindPartNo; this.plusOne = inventory_doPlusOne; this.minusOne = inventory_doMinusOne; }  The first line of this constructor creates a property called productList. This will end up serving the same purpose as the old productInfo array.  Note that I didn’t have to change the name; however, since this array is now part of a larger structure, I felt this new name better described the purpose of the array.   The second line defines a method called addInventoryItem. As the name  implies, the purpose of this method is to add an item to my inventory. In the old scheme of things, I simply added the items to my productInfo array one after the other. However, now that this array is held inside an object, it makes sense to have a method for this task rather than access the array directly.   4804-2 Ch18.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 223  Session 18—Creating and Using Methods  223  This brings up another advantage of using objects: If, at some point in the future, I decide to change the way items are stored in my inventory  that is, I want to store them in something other than an array , I don’t have to hunt down and replace all of the code that adds items to my inventory. Instead, I just have to rewrite the addInventoryItem method.  The remaining statements define the other three methods that my inventory class needs at this point. The names may look familiar because these are three functions that I’ve already written! So, all I have to do is rework them a bit to turn them into methods. All four of these methods are pretty straightforward, so I’ll just give you all of them now.  function inventory_doAddInventoryItem  theItem  {  var next = this.productList.length; this.productList[ next] = theItem; }  function inventory_doFindPartNo  partNo  {  var result = “”; for  x=0; x < this.productList.length; x++  {  var thisItem = this.productList[x]; if  thisItem.partNumber == partNo  {  result = thisItem; break; }  }  return result; }  function inventory_doPlusOne  partNo  {  var prodInfo = this.findPartNo  partNo ;    Do we have enough on hand to do this? if  prodInfo.inStock > 0  {     Update the quantities in the array prodInfo.inStock--; prodInfo.inCart++;    Copy these new values to the form document.cart.elements[ “quan_” + partNo].value =  prodInfo.inStock; document.cart.elements[ “inCart_” + partNo].value =  prodInfo.inCart; calcGrandTotal   } else {  S e s s i o n   1 8  P a r t   I V —  S a t u r d a y   E v e n i n g   4804-2 Ch18.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 224  224  Saturday Evening  alert  “There are no more of this item in stock!” ; }  function inventory_doMinusOne  partNo  {  var prodInfo = this.findPartNo  partNo ;    Do we have enough on hand to do this? if  prodInfo.inCart > 0  {     Update the quantities in the array prodInfo.inStock++; prodInfo.inCart--;    Copy these new values to the form document.cart.elements[ “quan_” + partNo].value =  prodInfo.inStock; document.cart.elements[ “inCart_” + partNo].value =  prodInfo.inCart; calcGrandTotal   } else {  alert  “You have no more in your shopping cart!” ; }  }  }  If you compare these methods with the functions they were derived from, you can see that there really isn’t much difference. Of course, all of the references to the old productInfo array have been replaced with references to productList, but that’s probably the most obvious change. What’s less obvious is that the this keyword has snuck its way into all of these methods. Why? Well, remember that these are methods now, so they belong to an object. Until now, there’s only been the possibility of having one shopping cart with only one inventory. But, now that everything is being rewritten as an object, there’s the very real possibility of mul- tiple shopping carts, each with one or more inventory objects inside it! Because of this, these methods must use the this keyword in order to know which inventory object they are actually working with when they are called.  The only truly new method here is the addInventoryItem   method. As you  can see though, there really isn’t that much to it. You simply pass it an itemInfo object, and it adds it to the end of the productList array.  The only thing left to do now is to actually put the new inventory object to  use. The code that does this is shown here.     create the inventory object var bpInventory = new inventory  ;   4804-2 Ch18.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 225  Session 18—Creating and Using Methods  225     now, load it with items var strollerInfo = new itemInfo  199.95, “Rock & Stroll - Deluxe”, “st-001”, 20, 5 ; var diaperInfo = new itemInfo  13.95, “Size 3, Extra Absorbent”, “dp-003”, 5, 100 ; var carSeatInfo = new itemInfo  149.95, “Ultra-Safe, Rear-Facing”, “cs-001”, 15, 5 ; var rattleInfo = new itemInfo  4.95, “UberNoise 5000”, “rt-001”, 5, 155 ; var babyWipeInfo = new itemInfo  9.95, “Clean and Fragrant”,  “bw-001”, 6, 75 ;  bpInventory.addInventoryItem  strollerInfo ; bpInventory.addInventoryItem  diaperInfo ; bpInventory.addInventoryItem  carSeatInfo ; bpInventory.addInventoryItem  rattleInfo ; bpInventory.addInventoryItem  babyWipeInfo ;  That’s pretty much all there is to it! Of course, the other chunks of code that  need to access the productList array will need to be rewritten a bit. The changes that are required, however, are trivial. The following code shows how the calcGrandTotal   function has to change to accommodate the inventory object.  Be sure to compare this to the original code for calcGrandTotal  , shown  ear- lier in this session.   function calcGrandTotal   {  var grandTotal = 0; for  x=0; x<bpInventory.productList.length; x++  {  var thisItem = bpInventory.productList[x];    Are there any of this item in the cart? if  thisItem.inCart > 0  {  grandTotal += thisItem.calcFinalCost   *  thisItem.inCart; }  }  document.cart.elements[‘grandTotal’].value = grandTotal; }  S e s s i o n   1 8  P a r t   I V —  S a t u r d a y   E v e n i n g   4804-2 Ch18.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 226  226  Saturday Evening  In this session, you learned how to add methods to your JavaScript objects.

You also  know how to use JavaScript to work with the various parts of the HTML page. So, you might be thinking that it would be really neat if you could  create custom objects that would make working with an HTML document even eas- ier. Well, you can!  Enhancing HTML Controls  Probably the most useful thing you can do is to create custom JavaScript objects that enhance the HTML controls on your Web pages. As you’ll recall from Session 13, all of the various HTML controls already have equivalent JavaScript objects, complete with a slew of properties and methods. However, these objects really only   4804-2 Ch19.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 228  228  Saturday Evening  provide the most basic functionality. For example, why is there no getValue   method to return the value of the selected radio button in a family? Sure, you can figure out which radio button is selected and get its value by yourself, but the omission is puzzling. Of course, just because one method is missing, that doesn’t mean that you’ll want to throw away a perfectly good object. An ideal solution would be to take the JavaScript objects that already exist  like the String object or the object that represents a radio button  and add the new properties and methods to them that you want.  In other programming languages, this sort of thing is very easy to do. You take  a preexisting class of objects, add some new properties and methods to it, and you’ve got a new class. This new class is called a subclass; and it can contain all of the properties and methods of the old class  which is called the “super class”  along with all of the new properties and methods that you’ve added. This process doesn’t affect the old class in any way, so the two classes will actually coexist inside your program at the same time. Unfortunately, in JavaScript, this isn’t as easy as it should be. JavaScript does offer a way to add new properties and meth- ods to a predefined class, but it doesn’t really allow you to create subclasses, and it doesn’t seem to work at all with the classes that are in the Browser Object Model.  I’ll be discussing this aspect of JavaScript a bit later in this session, in the section titled, “Extending Preexisting JavaScript Objects.”   Creating an object wrapper  Since you can’t modify the properties and methods of a control object directly, I’ll show you how to do the next best thing: create a wrapper object. As the name implies, a wrapper object is an object that wraps around another object. Since the wrapper is itself an object, you can give it whatever properties and methods you want. Now, before this gets too confusing, let me walk you through an example to show you exactly what I’m talking about.   For this example, I’ll try to address my earlier complaint about radio buttons. Specifically, why isn’t there a getValue   method associated with radio button objects? In the code that follows, I’m going to create a wrapper object that will add this method, along with a few others, to radio buttons. As with any other object you create, you need to decide exactly what functionality you want your wrapper object to have. A quick look at the constructor for my wrapper should give you an idea of what sort of functionality I want.  This source code can be found in the Session19 folder on your CD-ROM.   function radioObj  radioFamilyObject  {  this.control = radioFamilyObject;   4804-2 Ch19.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 229  Session 19—Enhancing HTML with JavaScript Objects  229  this.getLength = radioObj_doGetLength; this.getSelected = radioObj_doGetSelected; this.setSelected = radioObj_doSetSelected; this.channelUp = radioObj_doChannelUp; this.channelDown = radioObj_doChannelDown; this.getValue = radioObj_doGetValue; }  In this constructor, I’ve defined one property  control  and six new methods. You’ll also notice that this constructor accepts a parameter, radioFamilyObject. This parameter is assigned to the control property as the object is being created. So, what is the control property? Well, remember that this is a wrapper object. What it’s wrapping is, in fact, another object. In this case, it’s wrapping around a preexisting JavaScript radio button object. If that’s still not clear, consider the fol- lowing code.     Select a Delivery Method     Standard Shipping     Overnight Shipping     Slowest Possible       ‘wrap’ my custom object around the JavaScript object  var dMethodRadio = new radioObj  document.delivery.dMethod ;       In this listing, I’ve created a very simple form with one radio button family  inside it. In the script block that follows, I’m calling the radioObj constructor and passing it the JavaScript object that represents that radio button family. This object is what’s assigned to the control property inside the wrapper object. So, after this code executes, my wrapper object will have access to this control object and all of the properties and methods that come with it. For example, if I were to code  alert  dMethodRadio.control.length ;  an alert window containing a “3” would appear.  The only trick to creating the methods for a wrapper object is to remember to use the control property to actually retrieve information about your JavaScript control object. While the code to do this isn’t difficult, it is fairly lengthy! So,  S e s s i o n   1 9  P a r t   I V —  S a t u r d a y   E v e n i n g   4804-2 Ch19.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 230  230  Saturday Evening  open up the radioObj.htm file from the Session19 folder on your CD-ROM and give it a quick look over. Then use it to follow along with the rest of the discussion.  The first method for my wrapper, getLength  , is the simplest of them all. Like the short example I gave earlier, it simply looks at the length property of the con- trol object and returns it. Note also the presence of the this keyword. Remember that since this is an object, there could actually be dozens or hundreds of radio button families  and radioObj objects  defined in this HTML document. Again, the this keyword tells the JavaScript interpreter which of the radioObj objects I’m actually working with at that moment.  The remaining methods work much the same way. However, you’ll also notice that each of the other methods has a tendency to call one another. For example, the getValue   method calls the getSelected   method to determine which radio button to return the value from.  Tying your objects to your HTML  The last piece of this puzzle is the way you actually tie your custom objects to your HTML page. As you’ve already seen, your custom objects can actually include a preexisting JavaScript object as a property. But, how do you actually get these objects to interact with other parts of the HTML page? As always, the answer is event handlers. Take a look at the   at the end of the radioObj.htm file and you’ll see what I mean.  This is basically the same as first form you saw in this session, but I’ve added  onclick handlers to my radio buttons. I’ve also added several simple buttons, each with an onclick handler that calls a different method of the dMethodRadio object.   Don’t forget that just about any nonempty HTML tag  that is, any HTML tag with a beginning and ending tag  can trigger events. So, if you need to, you can hook your custom objects  or even your plain old functions  to just about any HTML tag in your document.  Tip  Extending Preexisting JavaScript Objects  As I mentioned at the start of this session, JavaScript contains a mechanism that will allow you to add properties and methods to some preexisting JavaScript objects. This is done by adding properties and or methods to an object’s prototype. You can think of an object’s prototype as its blueprint. If you change the proto-  type, you change the structure of the object. It’s sort of like making a change to an object’s constructor function, except that you can do it while your program is running.   4804-2 Ch19.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 231  Session 19—Enhancing HTML with JavaScript Objects  231  Now, before I go further, I need to tell you a bit more about how JavaScript  objects work. In addition to the String and Array objects that you’ve already learned about, JavaScript has several other built-in objects.  You’ll learn about most of these other objects in subsequent sessions.  All of these objects however, are based upon a single parent object that is named simply, Object. The Object class is the basis of almost every object in JavaScript, including the objects you create yourself.  The point of all this is that you can only change the prototype for a class if that class is built into the JavaScript language or if that class is one that you define yourself. So, while you can change the prototype for, say, the String class, you can’t change it for something like a radio button object. This is because radio button objects are a part of the Browser Object Model and not a part of the JavaScript language.  Enhancing the String class  So, with that in mind, what sorts of enhancements would be nice for something like the String class? Well, as you’ll remember, one of the more common data vali- dation tasks for strings is to check and see if the string is blank. So, let’s add a method to the string class that does just that. The following line of code shows how you actually add a new method to the String class.  String.prototype.isBlank = String_doIsBlank;  Pretty simple, eh? On the left-hand side of my statement is my class  String in this case , followed by the prototype keyword, followed by the name of the new method  isBlank . On the right-hand side of the statement is the name of the function that will implement the new method. The only thing left to do is to actu- ally write the implementation function and test it out.  function String_doIsBlank   {  var result = true; if  this != “”  {  for  x=0; x < this.length; x++  { var theChar = this.charAt  x ; if  theChar != “ “  {  result = false; break; }  }  }  S e s s i o n   1 9  P a r t   I V —  S a t u r d a y   E v e n i n g   4804-2 Ch19.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 232  232  Saturday Evening  return result; }  var oldAndBlank = “  “;    Add the new method to the String prototype String.prototype.isBlank = String_doIsBlank;  var blank = “”; var notBlank = “Not blank!”; var alsoBlank = “    “; alert  blank.isBlank   ; alert  notBlank.isBlank   ; alert  alsoBlank.isBlank   ;    Even ‘old’ strings get the new method! alert  oldAndBlank.isBlank   ;  If you are thinking that the code for the isBlank   method looks familiar, you are right. This is simply the code for the isBlank   function that I’ve been using all along. Of course, it’s been modified a little: The parameter that was passed  which told the function which string to check  has been replaced by the this keyword.  As you can see from this code, after I modify the prototype for the String class, every String object I create immediately has access to the new method. However, something you might not have expected is that even the String objects I created before I added the new method  the oldAndBlank variable in this example  have access to it! As far as I know, this rather surprising behavior is unique to JavaScript and it makes the prototype a “retroactive blueprint” for all of your objects, rather than a simple blueprint for any new objects you create.  Adding properties via the prototype  Of course, you can add properties in exactly the same way as you add methods. The values you assign to these properties will be immediately available in all objects of that class. For example, if I wanted to add a language property to all of my String objects, I would simply code:  String.prototype.language = “English”; var greeting = “Bonjour!”; greeting.language = “French”;  I can then use this property just like any other property of the String class; I  could even create methods to work with the property. Of course, if you want to use   4804-2 Ch19.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 233  Session 19—Enhancing HTML with JavaScript Objects  233  the prototype approach to extend a class of objects, be sure to place all of your prototype-modifying statements at the start of your HTML document. This way, you’ll be sure that all of your modifications have been made before the main part of your code begins to execute.  Adding Data Validation to HTML Controls  If you put all of this together in your mind, I think you might begin to see that a natural use for these techniques would be to add enhanced data validation meth- ods to the controls in your HTML forms. For example, wouldn’t it be neat if your text boxes could validate themselves? Of course it would!  function textObj  textControl, validChars  {  this.control = textControl; this.allowedChars = validChars; this.isValid = textObj_doIsValid; this.getText = textObj_doGetText; this.setText = textObj_doSetText; this.isBlank = textObj_doIsBlank; }  Here I have a fairly simple object that I’ll be able to wrap around a JavaScript  text box control object. The control property is the same as what you’ve seen before, and I’m pretty sure you can guess what the getText  , setText  , and isBlank   methods do. But, the allowedChars property and the isValid   method are entirely new.   Basically, the allowedChars property lets you specify which characters can be  typed into the control, and the isValid   method makes sure that only those characters are actually in the control. For example, if I wanted to create a control that only accepted numeric characters, my HTML might look like this:     And my JavaScript code would look like this:  var numText = new textObj  document.formName.NumText, “0123456789” ;  The code in the textOjb.htm file shows one way to implement all of these meth-  ods.  Again, this code isn’t too difficult, but it is pretty long, so open the file in your HTML editor so you can follow along.   S e s s i o n   1 9  P a r t   I V —  S a t u r d a y   E v e n i n g   4804-2 Ch19.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 234  234  Saturday Evening  For the most part, these methods defined in this file are all very straightfor-  ward.  You’ll notice, however, that the isBlank   method simply calls the isBlank   method that I added to the String class. To see exactly how this is done, see the textObj.htm file on your CD-ROM.  The only tricky method in the bunch is the isValid   method. This method examines the characters that have been typed into the control and compares them with the characters that are in the allowedChars property for the object. If any of those characters are not in the set of allowedChars, an alert window is displayed telling the user which characters actually are allowed.  By taking this approach, I can set up a text box that can validate its own con-  tents against any set of characters that I define. Better still, I don’t have to write a custom validation routine for each different type of data. The example file on your CD-ROM creates text boxes that check for numeric characters, alphanumeric charac- ters, hexadecimal characters, octal characters and more. However, if you really wanted, you could set up a text box that only allowed consonants or just vowels. It’s totally up to you.  Of course, I still have to tie this validation routine to my control. As usual, all  this requires is an appropriate event handler.   <input type=”text” size=”30” name=”NumText” onchange=”numText.isValid  ”  >  REVIEW  In this session, you saw how JavaScript objects can be used to enhance the abili- ties of your HTML documents. You learned how to create a wrapper object to add new properties and methods to the JavaScript objects that represent the controls in your HTML forms. You also learned about how to change the prototype for any of JavaScript’s built-in objects to add new properties and methods to those objects. Finally, you saw an example of how to use these new techniques to create a text box object that “knows” how to validate its own contents.  QUIZ YOURSELF  1. What is a wrapper object?

You also saw how to dynamically create blocks of JavaScript code. The idea behind both of these tricks was that you could build a customized Web page before the browser even shows the page. But what if you need to create and exe- cute a JavaScript statement after your Web page has finished loading? As you saw in Session 9, trying to generate new content for a page after it’s loaded will actu- ally wipe out the page as it currently exists. So, what you need is some way to dynamically create and execute new JavaScript statements without harming the current contents of your HTML document. Fortunately, JavaScript provides a func- tion that lets you do exactly that.  Using the eval   Function   The eval   function is probably the coolest, and most powerful, function in all of JavaScript. Simply put, the eval   function takes a string and passes it to the  ✔  4804-2 Ch20.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 238  238  Saturday Evening  JavaScript interpreter for execution. So, this line of code: eval  “alert  ‘Hello World!’ ” ; has exactly the same effect as this line of code: alert  ‘Hello World!” ; in both cases, an alert window containing the words “Hello World!” will appear.  As I said, you pass the eval   function a string for it to pass along to the JavaScript interpreter. In the example above, I passed it a hard-coded string. However, I could have passed it a variable that contained a string  var myCommand = “alert  ‘Hello World!’ ”; eval  myCommand ;  and the result would be the same. In fact, you can mix variables and hard-coded strings.  var myCommand = “alert”; eval  myCommand + “  ‘Hello World!’ ” ;  As long as the end result is a string, the eval   function will dutifully pass it to the JavaScript interpreter for execution.  While the eval   function is very cool, it isn’t magical. So, once your string gets to the JavaScript interpreter, it still has to be a valid JavaScript statement. For exam- ple, the following eval   call will generate an error just as it would if you had hard- coded the statement into your program: eval  “allert  ‘Hello World!’ ” ;  Variables and the eval   function  When the eval   function passes a string to the JavaScript interpreter for execu- tion, the interpreter executes the command just as if it were a part of your pro- gram. This means that the command has access to all of your global variables and any local variables that a normal statement would at that point in your program. For example:  var who = “World!”; var greeting = “Hello “; eval  “alert  greeting + who  ” ; function greet   {  var who = “Everybody!”; eval  “alert  greeting + who  ” ; }  greet  ;  Here, the first eval   call will produce an alert window that says, “Hello  World!” Inside the function however, I’ve declared a local variable named who that   4804-2 Ch20.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 239  Session 20—Dynamically Creating and Executing JavaScript  239  will be used by the second eval   call. This will result in an alert window that says, “Hello Everybody!”  In the above example, you’ll notice that the string I’m passing to the eval   function contains the names of my variables that I want the alert   method to display.   eval  “alert  greeting + who  ” ;  In other words, the contents of the greeting and who variables won’t be evalu- ated until after this command string has been passed to the JavaScript interpreter. However, I could have written this statement in a slightly different fashion:  eval  “alert  ‘“ + greeting + who + “‘ ” ;  Do you see the difference here? In this second version, the contents of my vari- ables are being extracted and placed into the command string before it’s passed to the JavaScript interpreter. This is the same as coding:  eval  “alert  ‘Hello World!’ ” ;  So, the question as to whether you should pass variables or hard-coded strings  is pretty much a matter of personal preference. However, as you can see from these simple statements, from a coding point of view, it’s certainly easier to just pass your variable names and let the JavaScript interpreter sort everything out for you.  What kinds of statements can you eval  ?  Thus far, all the examples I’ve shown you have been of very simple statements being passed to the eval   function. However, the eval   function can handle even the most complex JavaScript statements. The following example, while not the most complex possible, should give you an idea of what I’m talking about:          var theForm = “myForm”; var theControl = “result”; var val = “Hello World!”; eval  “document.” + theForm + “.” + theControl + “.value = val” ;    Back in Session 11, I said that one of the most powerful things about using JavaScript to create HTML was that you could store entire HTML structures in  S e s s i o n   2 0  P a r t   I V —  S a t u r d a y   E v e n i n g   4804-2 Ch20.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 240  240  Saturday Evening  JavaScript variables and then rearrange them programmatically to get the output you wanted. In this example, I’ve applied that same idea to JavaScript structures. By placing the names of these structures  that is, the names of my form and my text box  into JavaScript variables, I can use them to build commands that can be passed to the eval   function for execution.   The setTimeout   and setInterval   Methods  You might be thinking that the eval   function seems very similar to the win- dow.setTimeout   and window.setInterval   methods that you learned about in Session 8. Well, it is! These methods of the window object do pretty much exactly the same thing as the eval   function, they simply do it after a specified delay.  For detailed examples of these methods, refer back to Session 8.   Using objects with setTimeOut   and setInterval    As I said, the main difference between these methods and the eval   function is that the eval   function executes your command immediately. The setTimeOut   and setInterval   methods, however, wait until a specified number of millisec- onds have passed before they will execute your command. Due to the speed at which today’s computers run, even a few milliseconds can make a big difference in the state of your program. So, if you want to use either of these methods with an object, you have to be a little more careful about how you structure the command you pass to the method. For example, consider this:  function annoying_doAnnoy   {  alert  this.msg ; setTimeout  ‘this.annoy  ’, 5000 ; }  function annoying  message  {  this.msg = message; this.annoy = annoying_doAnnoy; }  var annoyEM = new annoying  “Hello!” ; annoyEM.annoy  ;  Looking at this, you might think that this code will repeatedly display an alert window with the message “Hello!” in it. Well, that’s what it’s intended to do, but there is a flaw in the code that will cause it to fail after the first alert window is displayed. The flaw is in the setTimeout   statement: setTimeout ‘this. annoy  ’, 5000 ;   4804-2 Ch20.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 241  Session 20—Dynamically Creating and Executing JavaScript  241  This statement is telling the JavaScript interpreter to wait five seconds and then call the annoy   method of this object. The problem with this is that, in five seconds the value of this will almost certainly be undefined, simply because our method will have finished executing five seconds ago. Actually, during those five seconds, this will probably have taken on several new values. Unfortunately, none of them are likely to be the same as when the setTimeout   method was called. The end result is that the annoy   method won’t be found and you’ll get an error message.  The only way around this is to specify the name of the object whose method you  want to be called. Of course, all of the Browser Object Model objects are smart enough to keep their names hidden away inside themselves. You can do the same thing with your custom objects, but it does require a bit of extra work when you define your objects. The following short program will show you what I’m talking about.  function annoying_doAnnoy   {  alert  this.msg ; setTimeout  this.name + ‘.annoy  ’, 5000 ; }  function annoying  name, message  {  this.name = name; this.msg = message; this.annoy = annoying_doAnnoy; }  var annoyEM = new annoying  “annoyEM”, “Hello!” ; annoyEM.annoy  ;  In this listing, I’ve added a name property to my object definition. It’s important to note that the value I assign to this property is the same as the name I’m giving to the JavaScript variable that will hold the object I’m creating. In other words, the name property in my object is the same as the name of the JavaScript variable that is holding the object. In this case, that name is “annoyEM.”   Why bother? Well, by giving my object knowledge of its own JavaScript variable  name, I can create a setTimeou   call like this one:  setTimeout  this.name + ‘.annoy  ’, 5000 ;  In this case, this is the same as coding:  setTimeout  ‘annoyEM.annoy  ’, 5000 ;  When this statement executes five seconds later, the correct object will be ref-  erenced and the call will be successful.  Note that everything I’ve told you here about setTimeout   can be applied to setInterval   also.

Keeping an object’s JavaScript variable name inside it is an incredibly powerful technique that can allow you to perform all sorts of tasks that would otherwise be quite a bit more difficult. For example, in Session 14, I showed you how to create a simple animation. While the code involved was fairly simple, it really doesn’t lend itself to multiple animations on the same page. However, if this code could be rewritten as an object, it would be a simple matter to sprinkle JavaScript-based animations throughout your pages. Here’s one way to create an animation object.  function animation_doPreLoad   {  for  x=0; x < this.numFrames; x++  {  this.animFrames[ x] = new Image  ; this.animFrames[ x].src = this.imgPath + this.name + x +  “.jpg”; }  function animation_doAnimate   {  if  this.animFrames[ this.numFrames - 1].complete  {  eval  “document.” + this.imgName + “.src =  this.animFrames[ this.currentFrame++].src” ; if  this.currentFrame == this.numFrames  {  this.currentFrame = 0; }  setTimeout  this.name + ‘.animate  ’, this.animSpeed ; }  function animation  name, path, numFrames, speed  {  }  }  } else {  this.name = name; this.imgName = name + “_img”; this.imgPath = path; this.animFrames = new Array  ; this.numFrames = numFrames; this.animSpeed = speed; this.currentFrame = 1; this.preLoad = animation_doPreLoad; this.animate = animation_doAnimate; this.preLoad  ; }   4804-2 Ch20.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 243  Session 20—Dynamically Creating and Executing JavaScript  243  Here I’ve taken the animation code from Session 14 and turned it into a simple object. The first parameter to the animation constructor function is the name of the JavaScript variable that will hold the object. I’ve also decided that the names of my graphics files will be based on this name as well.  So, if my JavaScript vari- able is titleAnim, the names of the graphics files on disk will be titleAnim0.jpg, titleAnim1.jpg, etc.  This is an arbitrary decision, but it makes the design of the object much simpler and establishes a logical relation between my graphics and the JavaScript code that will work with them.  The second parameter is the path that must be followed on the server to actu- ally get to the graphics for my animation. Note that this is only a partial path, up to, but not including, the actual file name.  The remaining parameters specify the number of frames in the animation as  well as the speed the animation should be replayed at. With this object defined, all that’s needed to create and play an animation is a simple JavaScript statement, like this:  var titleAnim = new animation  ‘titleAnim’, “.. images ”, 16, 250 ;  Along with a corresponding   tag in your HTML document:  <img name=’titleAnim_img’  src=’.. images titleAnim0.jpg’ border=’0’  onload=”setTimeout ‘titleAnim.animate  ’, titleAnim.animSpeed ”  >  Looking at the animate   method, you can see that both the eval   function  and the setTimeout   method play a role in making this animation work. The eval   function is needed  along with the name of the   tag  to load the next frame. But, before the animation can start, the setTimeout   method  along with the name of the JavaScript variable  is needed to check if all of the frames are loaded. It’s easy to perform these tasks when you are working with simple functions, but when you move to an object-based animation, you need access to the names involved to make things run smoothly.  Creating the Shopping Cart Object  At last! You’ve finally seen all of the techniques that are needed to create the shopping cart object. So, without further delay, let me show you the constructor for the shipping cart object.  Note that, since there’s so much code involved, I’m just going to show you the most important parts. Of course, you’ll find all of the source code for the shopping cart object on your CD-ROM in the Session20 folder.   S e s s i o n   2 0  P a r t   I V —  S a t u r d a y   E v e n i n g   4804-2 Ch20.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 244  244  Saturday Evening  function shopCart  cartName  {  this.name = cartName; this.cartForm = cartName + “_form”; this.cookieName = cartName + “_cookie”; this.clearCookie = false; this.inven = new inventory  ; this.initCart = shopCart_doInitCart; this.calcGrandTotal = shopCart_doCalcGrandTotal; this.plusOne = shopCart_doPlusOne; this.minusOne = shopCart_doMinusOne; this.enterQuantity = shopCart_doEnterQuantity; this.showProductInfo = shopCart_doShowProductInfo; this.drawCart = shopCart_doDrawCart; this.saveCart = shopCart_doSaveCart; this.loadCart = shopCart_doLoadCart;  this.submitCart = shopCart_doSubmitCart;  this.initCart  ; }  As you’ve probably guessed, I’ve simply retooled my old functions to become methods of the shopCart class. Since the methods are, for the most part, things you’ve already seen, let me go over the properties that are defined here.  The first property is name. As with the other examples you’ve seen in this ses-  sion, the name property is used to dynamically create JavaScript statements. However, these statements aren’t used with the eval   function. Consider this excerpt from the showProductInfo   method.  var inCartBox = “<input type=’text’ name=’inCart_” + pInfo.partNumber + “‘“; inCartBox += “onchange=’” + this.name + “.enterQuantity \”” + pInfo.partNumber + “\” ’”; inCartBox += “ value=’” + pInfo.inCart + “‘ size=’6’  >”;  For each item in my inventory, I create a text box that shows how many of that item the user has in her shopping cart. This code defines that text box. Now, if the user changes the value in this text box, I need to call an onchange handler to ver- ify that the value typed in is valid. This job falls to the enterQuantity   method, but I also need to specify which object this method belongs to.  Remember, there could be multiple shopping cart objects, so I can’t hard-code the name of my JavaScript variable here.  This is where the name property becomes invaluable. Assuming that the name of my shopping cart variable is “bpCart”, this code will generate the following HTML for the first item in my inventory:   4804-2 Ch20.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 245  Session 20—Dynamically Creating and Executing JavaScript  245  <input type=’text’ name=’inCart_st-001’ onchange=’bpCart.enterQuantity “st-001” ’ value=’0’ size=’6’  >  As you can see, the onchange handler that’s generated is exactly what’s needed to invoke the enterQuantity   method for the bpCart variable.  The second property is cartForm. This is simply the name followed by “_form”. One of the advantages of objects is that they let you “encapsulate” everything that some- thing can do. One of the things that I want my shopping cart to do is to create and output the form that it will display its information in. So, this is the name that I’ll use to create that form. This name is used in lots of different places in the shopCart methods, but the simplest is the calcGrandTotal   method, as shown here:  function shopCart_doCalcGrandTotal   {  var grandTotal = 0; for  x=0; x<this.inven.productList.length; x++  {  var thisItem = this.inven.productList[x];    Are there any of this item in the cart? if  thisItem.inCart > 0  {  grandTotal += thisItem.calcFinalCost   *  thisItem.inCart; }  }  eval  “document.” + this.cartForm +  “.elements[‘grandTotal’].value = grandTotal” ; }  The statement of interest here is the last statement in the method. Here I’m using the cartForm property to create a command string that is then passed to the eval   function. Once the JavaScript interpreter executes this statement, the text box showing the grand total of items ordered will be updated with the new total. The remainder of the properties and methods in the shopCart class work in much the same way. The cookieName property lets each shopping cart maintain its own cookie and all of the other methods have been reworked to use the cartForm property to communicate with the HTML form that is associated with each shopCart object.  Take a minute to load the index.htm file that’s in the Session20 folder into your Web browser. As you’ll see, it works exactly like the last version you saw. The only difference is that almost all of the underlying JavaScript has been converted to make use of objects.

You also learned how this function works with global and local variables. Next, you learned about how using the setTimeout   and setInterval   methods with JavaScript objects can lead to problems. I showed you that one way around this problem is to give your JavaScript objects a name property to hold the name of the JavaScript variable the object is kept in. This name can then be used to build setTimeout   and setInterval   state- ments that access the proper object and work correctly. Finally, you saw how all of these techniques can be used together to create a complex object like a shopping cart object.  QUIZ YOURSELF  1. What does the eval   function do?

The idea is that if  you can separate the content from the styles, you can present the same content on a wide variety of devices  such as Macintoshes, Palm PDAs, Windows PCs, televi- sions, and the like  simply by changing the styles that are used. To make this dream a reality, the World Wide Web Consortium  usually referred to as the W3C  created a standard called Cascading Style Sheets or simply CSS. By using CSS, you can control the appearance of just about every element on your HTML page, including the font family, size, color, transparency, and position. Best of all, you can use JavaScript to modify these styles after your page has been loaded and drawn in the Web browser. But, before I can tell you how to use JavaScript to work with your style sheets, I need to tell you a little about how style sheets themselves work.  By the way, since this book’s primary concern is JavaScript, I’m not going to go into the CSS standard in detail. For everything you need to know about CSS, visit the official CSS information site at www.w3.org TR REC-CSS2.   ✔ ✔  4804-2 Ch21.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 254  254  Sunday Morning  The Basics of CSS  The first thing to know is that if you are going to use style sheets, you should make the commitment to use them for all of the styles that you use in your Web pages. This means no   tags of any sort and no color or bgcolor attributes in your tables! While this might sound like a big sacrifice, believe me, once you use style sheets a few times, you’ll never want to go back to using the   tag!  If you just can’t let go of the   tag, you can mix style sheets with older styling options. However, I strongly recommend that you move entirely to style sheets as soon as you are comfortable with them.   What are style sheets?  Simply put, style sheets are lists of rules that tell the browser how to style various elements in your HTML document. These style rules are then applied to your HTML document as the Web browser is loading and drawing it in the browser window. For example, I might define a style rule that says, “I want anything inside a set of    tags to be shown in green.” With this information in hand, the Web browser will scan my document and whenever it finds a set of    tags, it will color the text inside green.  The   tag  Now that you know what style sheets are, the question becomes, “How do I put them in my HTML document?” There are actually several ways to insert styles into your HTML document, but the easiest way is to use the HTML   tag. For example, here’s the   tag that would tell the browser to color all of my   tags green:    address { color:green }    The tag itself tells the browser that a list of style rules will be coming next. The type= attribute tells the browser what standard these rules follow. The type speci- fied here tells the browser that these rules are plain text and that they follow the Cascading Style Sheet standard.  Note that there is at least one other style sheet “standard.” Ironically, it’s the JavaScript Style Sheets standard that was developed by Netscape. However, even though this is a book about JavaScript, we won’t be talking about this standard, simply because it is not the official standard of the   4804-2 Ch21.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 255  Session 21—Working with Cascading Style Sheets  255  W3C, and because only Netscape browsers support it.  Of course, you can have more than one rule in a style block, as shown here:    address { color:green } p { color:red }    About the only other thing you need to remember about the   tag is that you should include it at the top of your HTML document  preferably inside the    tags  so that the browser will know about your rules before it tries to render your document.  Anatomy of a style rule  OK, so what exactly does the rule address { color:green } mean, and how does it work? Well, at the most basic level, CSS rules are intended to be applied to HTML tags. So, the first part of a rule is simply the name of the HTML tag that you want the rule applied to; in this case, that’s the   tag.  The rest of the rule is enclosed in curly braces  {}  and tells the browser exactly how you want it to style the contents of the specified tag. In this case, I’ve speci- fied that I want the color of the contents of this tag to be green.  Knowing this, it’s pretty easy to see that the second rule in my example, p {  color:red } tells the browser that I want to color all of the text in all of my   tags red.  This brings up an important point: When you specify a style rule in this fash-  ion, you are requesting that every occurrence of the specified tag should be styled in exactly the same way. While this can be useful, it’s more common to want to apply styles to individual parts of a document. To allow for this, the CSS standard also allows for classes and IDs.  Using CSS classes  CSS classes aren’t the same as the object classes you learned about last night, but they are similar in concept. You define a CSS class when you want a group of ele- ments on your HTML page to use the same style. For example, consider the follow- ing style sheet.    p { font-weight:bold } p.alert { font-style:italic }    S e s s i o n   2 1  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch21.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 256  256  Sunday Morning  The first rule says that all   blocks should be boldface. The second rule  defines a class of   blocks that go by the name alert. This rule states that any   blocks in the alert class should be styled in italics.  You can list more than one style specification in the curly braces.  The trick now is simply creating a   block that is in the “alert” class. This is done simply by adding an appropriate class= attribute to a   tag:   Write to us at:    Hungry Minds  909 Third Avenue  New York, NY 10022     Thank You!   If you apply the style sheet defined earlier to this, you’ll see something like Figure 21-1.  Figure 21-1 The effect of our style sheet when applied to our HTML  As you can see, the first line is in boldface, the address is in italics and the last  line is back to just being boldface. What you might not also notice is that the italic section is in boldface as well. This is the “cascading” part of CSS. When two or more rules match an element, they all apply to the element. If there is a con- flict between rules, the rule that more precisely matches the element wins. If two or more rules precisely match the element, the last rule that was defined is the one that wins. As an example of this, consider the following:   4804-2 Ch21.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 257  Session 21—Working with Cascading Style Sheets  257    p { font-weight:bold } p.alert { font-weight:normal; font-style:italic }    Write to us at:    Hungry Minds  909 Third Avenue  New York, NY 10022     Thank You!   If you load this code into your browser, you’ll see something like Figure 21-2.  Figure 21-2 An example of cascading and conflicting style rules  Both rules define a setting for font-weight, but the second rule is the one that wins because it more precisely matches the HTML tag that surrounds the address. In each of these examples, I’ve shown a class being defined for a particular tag.  While this is perfectly valid, you don’t have to tie a class to any one type of tag. The following code shows how to define a class for use with just about any HTML tag.    p { font-weight:bold } .alert { font-weight:normal; font-style:italic }    Write to us at:   S e s s i o n   2 1  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch21.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 258  258  Sunday Morning    Hungry Minds  909 Third Avenue  New York, NY 10022   Or, send us an <a class=”alert” href=”mailto:custserdum@hungryminds.com”>e-mail!   Thank You!   Notice that in this example, I’ve defined my class without a tag simply by creat-  ing a rule that begins with a period. This is followed by the class name I want to use and then the styles that should be applied to elements of that class. I can then use this class inside both my   and my   tag.  Using CSS IDs  OK, so you can create document-wide styles and styles that are applied to a group of tags that you specify. What if you want a style to apply to a single element and no others? In that case, you can create a style that is associated with a CSS ID. This is an ID that should be unique inside a given type of HTML tag. In other words, you can have a   tag with an ID of contactInfo and you can have an   tag with an ID of contactInfo, but you can’t have two   tags  or two   tags  with an ID of contactInfo. The following shows how to declare and use a style rule using an ID.    p { font-weight:bold } contactInfo { font-weight:normal; font-style:italic } acontactInfo { font-weight:bold; font-style:italic }    Write to us at:    Hungry Minds  909 Third Avenue  New York, NY 10022   Or, send us an <a id=”contactInfo” href=”mailto:custserdum@hungryminds.com”>e-mail!   Thank You!   As you can see, ID definitions are preceded with a pound sign    character.  Here I’ve defined two ID-oriented rules: The first will match any element with an   4804-2 Ch21.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 259  Session 21—Working with Cascading Style Sheets  259  id= attribute of contactInfo and the second will match only the   tag that has an id= attribute of contactInfo.  Styles can also be applied to individual tags by using the style= attribute. You simply list the style specifications you want applied to the tag and separate them with semicolons. For example, if I only wanted one set of    tags to be red and boldface, and I didn’t want to bother with an ID definition, I could code:   I’ll be red and bold!   The problem with this approach is that it scatters your style definitions through- out your HTML document, making them difficult to update if and when a change is necessary.  The   tag  Most HTML tags that enclose text have side effects. For instance, the    tags create a link and the    tags create the look of a paragraph by adding white space above and below the text in the tags. So, what tag can you use if all you want is to apply a style to a chunk of text without any visual side effects? You can use the   tag!  The   tag is a recent addition to HTML that exists for no purpose other  than to allow you to demarcate a chunk of text. This makes it perfect for applying styles without any HTML-related side effects. Here’s an example of the   tag in action.    p { font-weight:bold } contactInfo { font-weight:normal; font-style:italic } acontactInfo { font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; text-decoration:none } .noticeMe { text-decoration:underline }    Write to us at:    Hungry Minds  909 Third Avenue  New York, NY 10022    Or, send us an  <a id=”contactInfo” href=”mailto:custserdum@hungryminds.com”>e-mail!   Thank You!   S e s s i o n   2 1  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch21.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 260  260  Sunday Morning  Using the   tag, along with an appropriate style rule, allows me to underline the text I want without any other visual side effects.  Using external style sheets  While the   tag makes it easy to create styles for a document, you don’t really begin to tap the power of style sheets until you use them to style all of the documents on your Web site. You can do this by storing your style rules in an external file and then linking that file to each of the HTML documents that you want to use those rules. There is one huge advantage to keeping your styles in external files: If you need to change a style on your Web site, you simply change the external style sheet and all of the pages that use that external style sheet will reflect the change immediately. This might not seem to important if your site only has a few pages, but if your site is several hundred or several thousand pages in size, it can save you hours or even days of work! There are two basic ways to use an external style sheet with your HTML documents: the   tag and the @import rule.  Note that any rules that are specified in an external style sheet can be overridden by the rules you specify in your document’s   block. Simply define the styles you want to take precedence after you link in your external style sheet.   Using the   tag The   tag is an HTML tag that lets you establish a link between your HTML document and an external document of some sort. Using it to create a link with an external style sheet is actually very simple. All you do is code something like this:  <link rel=”stylesheet” type=”text css” href=”babyPalooza.css” title=”bpStyles”  >  This tag is pretty simple. The rel= attribute tells the browser what type of doc-  ument we are linking to while the type= attribute tells the browser what type of style sheet it is. The href= attribute tells the browser the Web address of the external file. Finally, the title= attribute gives the external file a name that the browser can use to reference the file.  The @import rule Another way to bring in an external style sheet is to use the @import rule at the start of your   block. It looks like this.   4804-2 Ch21.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 261  Session 21—Working with Cascading Style Sheets  261    @import “babyPalooza.css”; p { font-weight:bold }    You simply create a new rule that starts with @import and then follow that with the Web address of the style sheet you want to import.  You can specify styles using any or all of these methods. However, if you are going to use the @import rule, be sure to use it before you define any other styles. If you don’t, the @import rule will be ignored by the browser.   That’s pretty much the basics of what you need to know about CSS in order to  be able to use them. Of course, there are tons of other styling options that you can specify. In order to find out about all of these other details, I once again rec- ommend that you visit the official CSS documentation page at www.w3.org TR  REC-CSS2. So, with all of that out of the way, it’s time to show you how you can use CSS and JavaScript together.  Using JavaScript with CSS  The key to using JavaScript with your style sheets is the Document Object Model. Now, I’ve already told you about the Browser Object Model, but the Document Object Model is slightly different. The Browser Object Model is the set of objects that allows a programming language  in our case, JavaScript  to interact with the Web browser and everything in it, including the document loaded into the browser. The Document Object Model  DOM for short  is a standardized set of objects that can be used to represent an HTML or XML document in any environment.  Like CSS, the DOM standard is maintained by the W3C.  Fortunately, the document object that’s included in the Browser Object Model is based on the DOM and that’s what allows your JavaScript programs to interact with the styles that you apply to the elements in your HTML document.  In Session 9, you got a pretty thorough tour of the document object. However, to save space  and avoid confusion  I did leave out many of the methods that are specified in the DOM standard. At this point however, it’s necessary to tell you about one of those methods: the getElementById   method. You see, when an HTML document is turned into a DOM-compliant object, every element  that is, each set of tags  in the document has a corresponding object created to represent it. These objects are called element objects and they contain an unbelievable amount of information about the element and what’s inside it. But, before you can inspect or change any of that information, you have to get hold of the element  S e s s i o n   2 1  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch21.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 262  262  Sunday Morning  object itself. That’s where the getElementById   method comes in. If you pass the ID of an element to this method, it will return the corresponding element object. You can then do pretty much what you want to the element and the changes will show up in the browser window.  As an example of this, I’ll create a CSS-based script that will hide and show a control simply by changing the style rule that’s associated with the control. To make this example both interesting and useful, the control I’ll do this to will be the debug information text box on the Baby-Palooza.com home page. First, I need to define a couple of styles that will make hiding and showing the control possible.  body { background-color:white; font-family:arial; font-size:8pt } td { font-size:8pt } textarea.debug { visibility:visible } textarea.debugHidden { visibility:hidden }  Next, I need to slightly change the tag that defines the text area control that  will display my debug information.  This is in the index.htm file.      All that’s left at this point is to define a button to trigger the change and the  JavaScript function that will actually make it happen. Here’s the definition of that new button from the index.htm file:  <input type=’button’ name=’toggle’ value=’Hide Debug Info’ onclick=’doShowHideDebug  ’  >  And the JavaScript function is shown here:  function doShowHideDebug   {  var debugText = document.getElementById  “debugCtl” ; if  document.forms[1].toggle.value == “Hide Debug Info”  {  debugText.className = “debugHidden”; document.forms[1].toggle.value = “Show Debug Info”; } else {  debugText.className = “debug”; document.forms[1].toggle.value = “Hide Debug Info”; }  }  The first thing this function does is call the document.getElementById    method and pass it an ID of debugCtl. This returns an element object that    4804-2 Ch21.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 263  Session 21—Working with Cascading Style Sheets  263  represents my text area control. I then use an if statement to determine whether I should hide or show the control. This decision is based on the value that’s inside my button.  Remember, the value property of a button is the string that actually shows up in the button on screen.  If the value in the button is Hide Debug Info the control must be visible. So, I change the className property of the text area to debugHidden. This immediately switches the style rule that is applied to the control and removes it from the screen. The final step is to change the value prop- erty of my button so that the button reads Show Debug Info.  Showing the con- trol again is done in much the same way. To see all of this code in action, load the index.htm file from the Session21 folder on your CD-ROM.   As I said earlier, the object returned by the getElementById   method exposes  a lot of information about the element in question. However, anything else you might do with this information lies in the realm of Dynamic-HTML. This is a large topic with so much neat stuff to cover, I’ll leave it for now so that I can discuss it in depth in the next session.  Deciding Which Style Sheet to Use  Remember at the start of this session, I said that style sheets were intended to help separate the content in a Web page from the style in which it was presented. So, you can define one set of styles for use with a Windows PC, another for a Macintosh, and so on. The trick is deciding which set of styles to use.  Of course, you can specify styles inside a set of    tags, so you  could just use JavaScript to dynamically generate all of your rules right there inside your page as it’s loaded. However, this would be incredibly inefficient because you’d have to keep all of your styles for all the platforms you support right there in your JavaScript code. So, using external style sheets and dynami- cally deciding which one to link is the way to go. The only problem is how do you determine which platform the browser is running on so that you can dynamically generate the appropriate   tag?  In Session 26, I’ll be telling you all about the navigator object and how it can  help you write cross-browser scripts. Until then, one property of the navigator object provides a perfect solution to this problem. This property, named platform, tells you exactly what you think it does: which computer platform the browser is running on. Table 21-1 shows the value of navigator.platform for several browsers and platforms.  S e s s i o n   2 1  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch21.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 264  264  Sunday Morning  Table 21-1 Values of navigator.platform  Platform Windows Me  Browser Netscape Internet Explorer  Win32  Value of navigator.platform  Macintosh OS 9.0.4  Netscape Internet Explorer  MacPPC  Linux  Mandrake 7.1  Netscape  LinuxELF2.0  As you can see, finding out which computer you are running on is pretty sim-  ple. The following code will show you how you can use this information  and a couple of String methods  to dynamically generate the appropriate   tag.  var styleLink = ‘<link rel=”stylesheet” type=”text css” title=”bpStyles” ‘; var platform = navigator.platform.substring 0, 3 .toUpperCase  ; if  platform == “WIN”  {  styleLink += ‘href=”babyPalooza-Win.css”  >’; }  if  platform == “MAC”  {  styleLink += ‘href=”babyPalooza-Mac.css”  >’; }  if  platform == “LIN”  {  styleLink += ‘href=”babyPalooza-Linux.css”  >’; }  document.writeln  styleLink ;  Of course, to work properly, this code should appear at the top of your HTML  document.  REVIEW  In this session, you learned about Cascading Style Sheets. You saw how to create a style sheet inside your HTML document and how to load an external style sheet. You saw how JavaScript can extract an object that represents an individual ele- ment  tag  from the document object. You also learned that, once you’ve got that element object in hand, you can do all sorts of neat things to it. Finally, you learned how the platform property of the navigator object can help you create a JavaScript program that lets you dynamically load the style sheet that’s best   4804-2 Ch21.F  4 9 01  8:16 AM  Page 265  Session 21—Working with Cascading Style Sheets  265  suited for the platform that the browser is running on. In the next session, I’ll be delving even further into these topics as I show you how to use Dynamic HTML to create all sorts of neat effects on your Web pages.  QUIZ YOURSELF  1.

In this session, you’ll be learning how you can use JavaScript to dynamically change the appearance and content of an HTML page after it’s already loaded into the Web browser. This process is called Dynamic-HTML or DHTML for short.  In the past, creating DHTML was a rather arcane art. Each of the major browsers  had a different underlying object model and, as a result, you had to write com- pletely different blocks of DHTML and JavaScript to accomplish the same things in each browser. Fortunately, with the adoption of the latest Document Object Model  DOM  standard, and the release of the latest versions of Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, that’s beginning to change for the better. Unfortunately, how- ever, DOM support isn’t yet complete in both browsers so it’s still necessary to use a trick or two to create a DHTML script that will run without modification. But it can be done, and it’s actually very simple to do!  ✔ ✔ ✔  4804-2 Ch22.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 268  268  Note  Sunday Morning  As I write this, the latest version of the DOM is Level 2. As noted above, the major browsers have incorporated a large part of the functionality of the Level 2 DOM, but some pieces are still miss- ing. I’ll be focusing on the parts that work in the latest versions of both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.  In other words, what you’ll be learning in this session is not guaranteed to work in older browsers.  For more information on the DOM Level 2 standard, visit www.w3.org TR DOM-Level-2-Core .  Dynamically Changing Styles  Cascading Style Sheets  CSS , which you studied in the last session, are the basis of all style manipulation under the DOM. So, to make styles easy to manipulate, the DOM makes provisions for browsers to define style objects that contain all the information needed to apply various style information to an element on the HTML page. The latest versions of both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator make this information available to your JavaScript program in the form of an object named style that’s a property of an element object.  When working in the realm of the DOM, the term element refers to a set of  opening and closing HTML tags and their contents or a single empty HTML tag. For example:   This is an element   In the line above, everything  including the    tags  is one element. In addition, elements  and element objects  can be nested one inside the other. In the line   This is a  bunch  of elements   there are actually several elements: one for the    tags, one for the    tags. And each of these chunks of text:  This is a bunch of elements  Is an element all it’s own, regardless of how many lines it may take. Finally, an empty tag like   is an element as well.   4804-2 Ch22.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 269  Session 22—Creating Dynamic HTML with JavaScript  269  Obtaining an element object  If you’ll remember from the last session, you can obtain an element object simply by calling the document.getElementById   method and passing it the id= attribute of the element you are interested in. So, if I have the following HTML defined:   Welcome to Baby-Palooza.com!   You can obtain the element object that represents this set of    tags  includ- ing all the subelements  with the following JavaScript:  var welcomeElement = document.getElementById  “welcome” ;  Once you have the element object in your possession, things begin to get very interesting.  Examining the style object  In the previous session, I showed you how to show or hide an element by changing the CSS class that it was associated with. While this is a neat trick, it’s also a fairly inelegant way to do things. After all, when you change an element’s CSS class, you are basically changing all of the style information for that element. It would be much nicer if you could only change a particular aspect of an element’s style with- out affecting its class or other style attributes. This is exactly what a style object allows you to do.  Getting at the style object for an element is easy: Simply extract the element in  question using the getElementById   method and then you can examine any property of the style object that you are interested in. For example, to see the color property of the welcomeElement defined earlier, I could code:  alert  welcomeElement.style.color ;  By now, you’re probably very curious as to the names of all the properties inside the style object. Well, unfortunately, there are a lot of them. No really, I mean a lot!  Because of this, I’m not going to go over each property in detail. Instead, I’m  going to give you a quick JavaScript program to list all of the properties and their contents. I will be going over some of the more useful properties, but for the full list  along with valid values for each  you should check out the CSS information page at www.w3.org TR REC-CSS2.   Welcome to Baby-Palooza.com     S e s s i o n   2 2  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch22.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 270  270  Sunday Morning     Get the element that represents our test paragraph var welcomeElement = document.getElementById  “welcome” ;    List all the properties of the element’s style object for  x in welcomeElement.style  {  document.write  x + “ = “ ; document.write  eval  ‘welcomeElement.style.’ + x  ; document.write  “ ” ; }  If you load this program  it’s in the Session22 folder on your CD-ROM , you’ll see the welcoming text followed by a list of properties that come straight from the style object.  Changing a style property  The nice thing about the style object is that all of its properties are changeable. So, if I want to make my welcoming text red, all I have to code is:  welcomeElement.style.color = “red”;  and the text will immediately become red on the screen. Of course, while you can assign values to the various properties of the style object, you need to make sure that the value you assign is valid for that property. Again, you’ll find a complete list of valid values for each style property at www.w3.org TR REC-CSS2. But, in the interest of getting you going right away, here’s a list of some of the more use- ful style properties along with their valid values.  As usual, you’ll find a program demonstrating each of these properties on your CD-ROM. As you play with the example programs on the CD-ROM, don’t worry too much about entering an invalid value. Usually, the DOM will reject an invalid value and use an applicable default without any trouble. About the worst you might run into is a simple JavaScript error dialog.   Note  When you compare the list of style properties on the W3C Web site with the list here, the W3C properties will have names like “background-color” rather than “backgroundColor.” Since the W3C names are not valid JavaScript variable names, the browser makers removed the hyphens and capitalized the first letter of the second word in order to make them usable from JavaScript. However, when you are using these properties in your CSS style rules, you must use the hyphenated form.   4804-2 Ch22.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 271  Session 22—Creating Dynamic HTML with JavaScript  271  The backgroundColor property This property controls the background color of the element. Valid values include any of the standard color names from Session 9 or any six-digit RGB hexadecimal color value.  See Table 9-1 for a partial list.   welcomeElement.style.backgroundColor = “yellow”;  The backgroundImage property This property lets you specify an image to be placed in the background of the ele- ment  above the background color but behind the text . You must specify the Web address of the image in a very specific format, as shown in the example below.  Note that no quotes are necessary inside the parentheses.   welcomeElement.style.backgroundImage = “url .. images happyBaby.jpg ”;  The backgroundRepeat property If you specify a background image, you can also specify if that image should be repeated in the element by setting this property. Valid values are repeat  the default , repeat-x  repeats the image across the page , repeat-y  repeats the image down the page , and no-repeat.  For some really nifty background image effects, be sure to check out the background-attachment and background-position properties at www.w3.org TR REC-CSS2.   welcomeElement.style.backgroundRepeat = “no-repeat”;  The borderColor property If you have created a border around an element  see the borderStyle property later in this session , this property can be used to set its color. Valid values are the same as for the color property.  welcomeElement.style.borderColor = “green”;  You can also pass multiple values to specify a different color for each edge of  the border.  welcomeElement.style.borderColor = “green red black blue”;  S e s s i o n   2 2  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch22.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 272  272  Sunday Morning  The borderStyle property This property lets you specify style of the border around the element. Valid values are dashed, dotted, double, groove, inset, none, outset, ridge, and solid. You can specify a single value and it will be used for all four edges of the border. Or, you can specify a value for two, three, or all four edges. For example, the fol- lowing statement will create a double border around the element.  welcomeElement.style.borderStyle = “double”;  The following statement will create a border that is solid on the top and bottom  and dashed down the sides.  welcomeElement.style.borderStyle = “solid dashed”;   For more precise control over the border around an element, you can set the bor- der-top, border-left, border-right, and border-bottom properties individually.   The borderWidth property If you have created a border around an element  see the borderStyle property, above , this property can be used to set the width of the line used to draw it. Valid values are medium, thin, thick, or a number of pixels.  Note that you cannot specify a negative number.   welcomeElement.style.borderWidth = “10px”;  You can also pass multiple values to specify a different width for each edge of  the border.  welcomeElement.style.borderWidth = “thin thick medium 20px”;  The color property This property controls the color that the element’s text is drawn in. Valid values include any of the standard color names from Session 9 or any six-digit RGB hexa- decimal color value.  See Table 9-1 for a partial list.   welcomeElement.style.color = “brown”;  The display property This property controls how the element is laid out and displayed in the Web browser. Valid values are block, inline, list-item, and none. Elements that   4804-2 Ch22.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 273  Session 22—Creating Dynamic HTML with JavaScript  273  “block out” areas on the screen  like the    tags  should have a value of block, while elements that exist inside other elements  like the    tags  should have a display value of inline. The list-item setting is similar to the block setting with the addition of a list item marker.  In other words, a bullet. Note that not all browsers support this setting.  To remove an element from the screen and cause the other elements on the screen to fill in where the element was, set the element’s display property to none.  welcomeElement.style.display = “none”;  The fontFamily property This property controls the font family  Helvetica, Arial, Times, to name a few  used to draw the text inside the element. You can, theoretically, specify any font family installed on the client. If you specify a font family that isn’t installed on the client, the browser’s default font will be used.  welcomeElement.style.fontFamily = “symbol”;  The fontSize property This property controls the font size of the text inside the element. Any number from zero up is valid, but you also need to supply a unit measurement for the size specified. Table 22-1 presents valid units.  Table 22-1 Valid Units of Measurement to Specify Font Size of an Element  Unit %  cm  em  ex  mm  Usage The font should be scaled to the given percentage of the default font size for the element.  For example, if the default height is 10pt and a 120% fontSize is specified, the font would be scaled to 12pt.   Centimeters — the size is supplied in centimeters.  ems — this means that the number is expressed in ems.  x-height — this scales the font relative to the height of the char- acter x in the font.  Millimeters — the size is supplied in millimeters.  Continued  S e s s i o n   2 2  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch22.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 274  Table 22-1  274  Unit pc  pt  px  Sunday Morning  Continued  Usage Picas — the number supplied is a number of picas.  Points — this is a traditional font point size.  Approximately 1 72 of an inch.   Pixels — this means that the number supplied is a number of  pixels.  Note that if you don’t supply a unit designation, px will be used by default.   So, any of the following statements would be a valid assignment to the fontSize property:  welcomeElement.style.fontSize = “10px”; welcomeElement.style.fontSize = “45%”; welcomeElement.style.fontSize = “10cm”;    yikes!  The fontStyle property This property controls the style applied to the text inside the element. Valid values are normal, italic, and oblique.  Most browsers render italic and oblique the same way.   welcomeElement.style.fontStyle = “italic”;  The fontWeight property This property controls the weight  density  of the text inside the element. Valid values are normal, bold, bolder, lighter, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900. The normal setting is equivalent to 400 and the bold setting is equivalent to 700.  welcomeElement.style.weight = “900”;    as bold as it gets!  The height property This property specifies the height of the element on the screen. You can assign this property any positive number and the element will be resized.  Note that you can use the same measurement units specified in Table 22-1, in the discussion of the   4804-2 Ch22.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 275  Session 22—Creating Dynamic HTML with JavaScript  275  fontSize property earlier in this section. Note also that a percentage value is inter- preted to mean a percentage of the vertical space visible in the browser window.   welcomeElement.style.height = “50%”;  The margin property This property lets you specify the margins surrounding the element. Valid values include positive and negative numbers.  Note that all browsers may not support specifying negative values. You can use the same measurement units specified in Table 22-1.   welcomeElement.style.margin = “50px”;  You can also pass multiple values to specify a different margin size for each side  of the element.  welcomeElement.style.margin = “20px 50pt 10px 35mm”;   For more precise control over the margin around an element, you can set the mar- gin-top, margin-left, margin-right, and margin-bottom properties individually.   The padding property This property lets you specify the padding on the inside of the element  that is, the space between the outside edges of the element and the text inside . Valid val- ues include positive numbers from zero on up.  You can use the same measurement units specified in Table 22-1.   welcomeElement.style.padding = “50px”;  You can also pass multiple values to specify a different padding width for each  side of the element.  welcomeElement.style.padding = “20px 50pt 10px 35mm”;   For more precise control over the padding inside an element, you can set the padding-top, padding-left, padding-right, and padding-bottom properties  individually.   The textAlign property This property specifies the alignment of the text in the element. Valid values are left, right, and center.  welcomeElement.style.textAlign = “center”;  S e s s i o n   2 2  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch22.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 276  276  Sunday Morning  The visibility property This property determines if the element is visible or not. Valid values are visible and hidden.  welcomeElement.style.visbility = “hidden”;  Note that even if you hide an element it will still take up space on the page. To  remove an element from the layout of a page, set its display property to none.  See the discussion of the display property earlier in this session for more infor- mation on this.   The width property This property specifies the width of the element on the screen. You can assign this property any positive number and the element will be resized.  Note that you can use the same measurement units specified in Table 22-1. Note also that a percent- age value is interpreted to mean a percentage of the horizontal space visible in the browser window.   welcomeElement.style.width = “25px”;  Moving Elements Around  One of the nice things about CSS is that it lets you precisely position elements on the screen. Simply by specifying the appropriate values for the position, top, left, bottom, and right properties of the style object, you can tell the browser exactly how and where you want something to appear on the screen. The really cool part however, is that you can also take an element and, simply by repeatedly chang- ing one or more of these position-related properties, move stuff around the browser window.  There are loads of other neat things you can do with the position-related properties of the style object. Unfortunately, there just isn’t room to cover them all in this book. So, I’ll just be focusing on how to move things around the screen. For the scoop on all the other capabilities these properties give you, be sure to visit the official CSS documentation site at www.w3.org TR DOM-Level-2-Core .   The position property  The key to CSS-based animations is the position property. This property lets you tell the browser how you want an element positioned on the page as opposed to   4804-2 Ch22.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 277  Session 22—Creating Dynamic HTML with JavaScript  277  exactly where you want it positioned. There are several different values you can assign to the position property, but for the purpose of animation, you want to specify a value of absolute. This value tells the browser that you, the program- mer, will let the browser know exactly where to position the element on the page. It’s then up to you to specify a physical position and shape for the element by set- ting the top, left, bottom, right, height, and width properties to the appropri- ate values. You already know about the height and width properties, so let me tell you a bit about the others.  The top, left, bottom, and right properties let you determine where on  screen an element is drawn, relative to the parent element that it’s inside. For example, if you have a    inside a   , and you reset the top, left, bottom, or right properties of the    element, the values you specify will be taken as being relative to the position of the    element.  For example, if I assign a value of 50 to the bottom property of the     element, the bottom of that element will be moved so that it’s 50 pixels away from the bottom of the    element.  If an element has no parent  or if the parent element isn’t positioned itself ,  these properties specify the position of the element relative to the    element  in other words, the browser window .  If you found that a bit confusing, don’t worry... it’s really not that hard once you’ve seen it in action. So, with that in mind, crank up your HTML editor and open the movingThings.htm file from the Session22 folder on your CD-ROM. This is a rather simple  if lengthy  program that takes a paragraph element and moves it back and forth across the top of the browser window. I’ve thrown in a background image so that you can watch the paragraph float over it.  Looking at this code, you see that after specifying my styles, I create a simple paragraph element that holds my usual greeting. When my JavaScript begins exe- cuting, the first thing it does is retrieve the element object for my paragraph. Next I assign a value of “absolute” to this element’s position property. This removes the element from the layout flow of the page and gives me the ability to move it around.  Skipping to the end, you’ll see that a simple call to the setInterval   method  is what kicks off the animation and keeps it going. Every 10 1000 of a second, it calls the moveit   function, which slides the paragraph back and forth across the page. While the concept behind the moveit   function is fairly simple, the way the styles work in today’s browsers make it a little trickier than you might expect. The first problem is that, unless you specify a nonzero value for the top, left,  bottom, or right style properties, they will contain empty strings until you put something in them. So, the moveit   function checks for that, and sets the curPos variable to zero if the left property actually is empty.  S e s s i o n   2 2  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch22.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 278  278  Sunday Morning  If the left property isn’t empty, we’ve actually got an even stickier problem to deal with. You see, all four of the position-related properties are actually stored as strings, complete with unit information at the end! So, if you assign a zero to the left property, what you’ll actually get back later is 0px. This makes performing math with these properties rather difficult. So, rather than fooling around with a bunch of intermediate String method calls, the moveit   function splits the con- tents of the left property into an array  using the p in px as the separator  and then converts the numeric part into an actual number.  Remember, px are the default units for all of the numeric style properties. So, if you use a different set of units, you’ll have to modify your code accordingly to extract the numbers you need.  Once I’ve secured the value I need, I check to see which direction I’m mov- ing and incrementally increase or decrease the left property accordingly.  Finally, you’ll notice that in order to change directions, I’m forced to compare  the left position of my element with the width of the screen minus a hard-coded value  470 . This is necessary because, unless you set the width property of an element, there’s no way to tell how wide it is. So, if you’ll look at the style rule I defined for my paragraph, you’ll see that I set it to be 450 pixels wide, just enough to get all my message text on one line.  The 20 extra pixels account for the scroll bar on the right-hand side of the window.   While this is a very simple program, it actually contains all the tricks you need to create your own CSS-based animations. Remember, with this technique, you can move any element: a paragraph, a list, an image, whatever you want.  Changing Text in the Browser Window  The last DHTML trick I want to share with you is how to change the text you see in your browser window. As you’ve seen before, if you try to do this with document.write   calls, you’ll just end up erasing the contents of your browser window. Fortunately, DHTML makes what seems impossible, incredibly easy.  The innerHTML property  The key to this trick is a wonderfully nonstandard property of the element object named innerHTML. That’s right, I said it was nonstandard. Unfortunately, there really isn’t a simple equivalent to the innerHTML property in the DOM. That’s too bad, because the innerHTML property is incredibly easy to use and incredibly pow- erful too. Even though innerHTML isn’t a part of the DOM, I’m telling you about it here for two reasons:   4804-2 Ch22.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 279  Session 22—Creating Dynamic HTML with JavaScript  279  1. As I’ve said before, DOM compliance in the major browsers isn’t yet 100%.  So, while there might be a multistep way to accomplish the same thing via the DOM, not all versions of the major browsers support the DOM fully enough to allow it.  2. Amazingly, all current browser versions on all platforms  that I’ve been  able to test  support the innerHTML property. This combined with its usefulness and popularity, have me convinced that the innerHTML prop- erty is here to stay.  So, what does the innerHTML property do? Well, it allows you to change the HTML that’s inside an element. It’s that simple and that powerful. For example, consider the following code.   Welcome to Baby-Palooza.com     var welcomeElement = document.getElementById  “welcome” ;  welcomeElement.innerHTML = “ Thanks for your business! ”;    As usual, this code defines a paragraph element and then a call to the  getElementById   method retrieves the object that represents that element. The final statement however, is what makes the innerHTML property so special. You’ll notice that I’m assigning a new string to the innerHTML property. Part of this string is a set of    tags. Immediately after this statement executes, the text in my paragraph will change to the text “Thanks for your business!” and it will be in boldface!  If you don’t believe it, give the innerHTMLProperty.htm file a try and see for yourself.  If that seems simple, it is! Fortunately, the innerHTML property is just as powerful as it is simple. So, make sure you know exactly what you are changing when you use the innerHTML property and remember that the key is to assign each of your elements a unique ID. Once you’ve done that, creating your DHTML JavaScript code becomes incredibly simple.  REVIEW  In this session, you learned how to create JavaScript code that will dynamically manipulate the HTML elements in your Web pages. You learned how an element’s style object contains everything you need to manipulate the appearance of an ele- ment on the page. In addition, you found out how JavaScript can move an HTML element around the browser window. Finally, you learned how the innerHTML prop- erty of an element can be changed to place new text on the screen.

After you’ve played with it a bit, take a look at the source code. It incorporates almost everything we’ve discussed in this session and more than a few concepts from the other parts of the book. Plus, it’s a very useful investigative tool in its own right!  QUIZ YOURSELF  1. Where is the style information for an element kept?  See “Dynamically  Changing Styles.”   2.

Fortunately, from a JavaScript programmer’s point of view, working with a frames-based site is almost as easy as working with a nonframes-  based site.  How JavaScript Views Frames  To create a frames-based site, you first have to define an HTML frameset document. This is just an HTML document that has a set of    tags rather than a set of    tags. Inside the    tags you define one or more   tags that tell the browser which file to load for each frame along with how the frame should appear in the browser window. The   4804-2 Ch23.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 282  282  Sunday Morning  following code shows a simple frameset document.  Note that this code is in the listing23-1.htm file in the Session23 folder.       Welcome to Baby-Palooza.com!      <frame name=”prodInfo” src=”welcome.htm” scrolling=”yes” frameborder=”no”>  <frame name=”cart” src=”cart.htm” scrolling=”yes” frameborder=”no”>        In Session 8, I mentioned that, as far as JavaScript is concerned, a frame is just  another window object. So, when you load this document into a Web browser, it actually creates three window objects: one to represent the frameset document itself and one for each of the   tags. The window object representing the frameset document becomes the parent object, and the others become entries in the parent.frames array.  If you look closely at the preceding code, you’ll see that, in addition to specify-  ing which HTML file should be loaded into each frame  the src= attribute , I’ve also given each of my frames a name= attribute. As you might expect, these will end up being used as the names of the JavaScript window objects that represent each frame.  Communicating between frames  If you have a bit of JavaScript in one frame that needs to talk to a bit of JavaScript in another frame, it’s very simple to do. For example, let’s assume that the frameset shown earlier is loaded and that the following code is defined in the welcome.htm file:  function welcome   {  alert  “Welcome to Baby-Palooza.com!” ; }  If I wanted to call this function from the cart.htm file, any one of the following  statements would do the trick.  parent.prodInfo.welcome  ; parent.frames[0].welcome  ; parent.frames[‘prodInfo’].welcome  ;   4804-2 Ch23.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 283  Session 23—Working with Frames  283  How does this work? Well, consider the first of these statements:  parent.prodInfo.welcome  ;  The first thing to remember is that this statement is being executed from inside  a frame  the cart frame to be exact . So, in order to reach the prodInfo frame, the code has to have a reference point in common with the prodInfo frame. That’s where the parent object comes in. Since both of these frames were created from the same frameset document, they both have the same parent. So this code says, “Look inside my parent object. Inside this, you should find another object named prodInfo. Look inside this object and call the function named welcome.” The other two statements work in almost exactly the same way. The only difference is that they go through the parent object’s frames array rather than addressing the frame directly by name.  Frame-to-frame communication isn’t restricted to making function calls. You  can access any variables, functions, or objects that you might have defined in another frame.  Working with nested frames  As you can see, using JavaScript to work with frames is pretty simple. However, it’s entirely possible to create a frames-based site that has multiple framesets nested one within the other. Consider the following frameset document:      Welcome to Baby-Palooza.com!      <frame name=”prodInfo” src=”welcome.htm” scrolling=”yes” frameborder=”no”>     <frame name=”cart” src=”cart.htm” scrolling=”yes” frameborder=”no”>  <frame name=”ads” src=”ads.htm” scrolling=”yes” frameborder=”no”>           Here, my first frameset defines two rows while my second splits the bottom rows  into two columns. Assuming that my welcome   function is still defined in the welcome.htm file, how could code in the ads frame call it? Either of these state- ments would work.  S e s s i o n   2 3  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch23.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 284  284  Sunday Morning  parent.parent.prodInfo.welcome  ; top.prodInfo.welcome  ;  When you nest frames, each set of    tags becomes the parent object of the frames defined inside it. So, because my ads frame is inside two sets of    tags, I have to back up through two parent objects to reach the prodInfo frame.  Of course, if you have a lot of nested frames, traipsing through all of these par-  ent objects can quickly become tedious. So, JavaScript provides the top object. The top object represents the actual frameset document that was loaded into the browser. A special feature of the top object is that, instead of using a multidimen- sional array to hold nested frames, each frame’s window object is turned into a property of the top object. So, even though the ads frame is nested two levels deep, you can access it simply by coding top.ads. The same holds true for top.prodInfo and top.cart. So, assuming that the following function is defined in the ads.htm file:  function showAd   {  alert “Please support our sponsors!” ; }  You could call this function from the welcome.htm file simply by coding:  top.ads.showAd  ;  The timing problem  For the most part, communicating between frames is very simple. However, this assumes that the contents of all of your frames are completely loaded. What if, as it’s being loaded, the JavaScript code in your first frame tries to call a function in your last frame? If the HTML document in your last frame hasn’t finished loading and that function doesn’t exist, you’ll get an error message and your JavaScript program will halt. How can you get around this problem? The only real solution to this is to check and see if the contents of a given frame are fully loaded before you try to access anything in that frame.  For example, assume that the code from our second frameset document is being  loaded. The first thing the browser will do is load the contents of the first frame  the welcome.htm  file and execute any JavaScript it finds there. If one of the JavaScript statements in this file attempts to call the showAds   function that’s in the ads.htm file, the statement will very likely fail because the ads.htm file simply hasn’t had time to be loaded into the ads frame yet.   4804-2 Ch23.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 285  Session 23—Working with Frames  285  You might think that you could simply put an onload event handler into the  ads.htm file. This handler could send some sort of message to the prodInfo frame telling it that it was loaded and that it was safe to call the showAds   function. While this will work for a very simple HTML file, it might not work for a complex HTML file with a lot of forms and controls. The reason is that the onload handler simply fires when all of the data for a page has been loaded. Unfortunately, this doesn’t always correspond to the time when all of the data on a page has been loaded and then parsed into all of the JavaScript objects that make up the Browser Object Model. So, even though the data for a page has been loaded into the browser, the JavaScript objects that represent that data might not be available yet. The solution to this problem is actually quite simple, but not incredibly obvious.         function showAd   {  alert “Please support our sponsors!” ; }        This is the advertising frame!                  function welcome   {  alert  “Welcome to Baby-Palooza.com!” ; }  function doAdShow   {  var tryAgain = true; if  top.ads != null  {  Here you’ll notice that I’ve defined a dummy form. It has no purpose other than to simply sit there and take up space. To see why, consider this version of the wel- come.htm file.  S e s s i o n   2 3  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch23.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 286  286  Sunday Morning  if  top.ads.document != null  {  if  top.ads.document.forms.length > 0  {  top.ads.showAd  ; tryAgain = false; }  }  }  if  tryAgain  {  setTimeout  ‘doAdShow  ’, 1000 ; }  }        Welcome to Baby-Palooza.com!       Rather than calling the showAd   function directly, I’ve defined an onload han- dler that calls the doAdShow   function. This function begins by setting up a local variable called tryAgain and assigns it a value of true. With this out of the way, the function uses three if statements to check and see if the contents of the ads frame have been completely loaded and parsed. First, it checks to see if the top.ads object exists. The existence of this object tells the function that, at the very least, the   tag that will load the ads.htm file has been parsed. The function then checks to see if the top.ads.document object exists. If this object exists, you can be sure that the ads.htm file has begun to load. Finally, the function checks to see if the length property of the top.ads.document.forms array is greater than zero. If this value is greater than zero, the function knows for sure that the dummy form has been loaded, parsed, and is available for JavaScript to use.  Why check the length of the forms array? Remember that the JavaScript inter- preter loads and parses the information in an HTML document from the top to the bottom as it comes to it. By placing a an empty form at the end of my document and then checking to see if that form is loaded and parsed, I can tell if everything before that form has been loaded and parsed! So, if all of these tests are success- ful, the function can call the showAd   function with complete confidence and set the tryAgain variable to false. However, if any of these if statements fails, the value of tryAgain will remain true and a call to the setTimeout   method will tell the JavaScript interpreter to try again in one second.   4804-2 Ch23.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 287  Session 23—Working with Frames  287  Dynamically Creating Frame Content  In Session 11, you saw how document.write   and document.writeln   could be used to dynamically create HTML and JavaScript code in a window. Well, it’s also possible to use these calls to dynamically create HTML and JavaScript code in a different frame.  Actually, the process for writing HTML or JavaScript out to a different frame is  almost exactly the same as for writing HTML out to the current frame. The only difference is that you have to specify the name of the frame you want to write to. For example, consider this slightly different version of the nested.htm file.      Welcome to Baby-Palooza.com!    function loadProdInfo   {  top.prodInfo.document.open  ; top.prodInfo.document.writeln  “ <body  bgcolor=’white’>” ;  Palooza.com!” ;  top.prodInfo.document.writeln  “Welcome to Baby-  top.prodInfo.document.writeln  “  ” ; top.prodInfo.document.close  ; }         <frame name=”prodInfo” src=”” scrolling=”yes” frameborder=”no”>     <frame name=”cart” src=”” scrolling=”yes” frameborder=”no”>  <frame name=”ads” src=”” scrolling=”yes” frameborder=”no”>           As soon as the outermost frameset finishes loading, the loadProdInfo   func- tion is called. This function contains five simple statements that store an entirely new HTML document into the prodInfo frame. The first of these statements calls  S e s s i o n   2 3  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch23.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 288  288  Sunday Morning  the document.open   method for the prodInfo frame. As you learned in Session 9, this clears the current contents of the frame and opens an output stream into it.  The next three statements write out the new HTML document into the frame. It’s  important that you realize that these statements are writing out a complete and valid HTML document! When you replace the contents of a frame in this way, you must output a set of valid    and    tags if you want your new document to be processed properly. This includes any additional attributes  like the bgcolor= attribute in the   tag  that you need for your document to be properly formatted. While it is true that today’s browsers will assume that a docu- ment is an HTML document, future browsers are under no obligation to do the same! So, to get the correct results, always output as much information as possible.  The final statement calls document.close   for the prodInfo frame. This  closes the output stream and tells the browser that you are finished adding text to the document. The browser will then complete the process of rendering the HTML you’ve sent to the frame.  Using the frameset document as a control center  On many frames-based Web sites, you’ll find that all of the JavaScript code that con- trols the site is loaded into one frame. This JavaScript code then creates or manipu- lates the contents of the other frames. Oddly, this JavaScript code is almost always to be found in one of the visible frames on the site. It’s a little known fact that you can actually run JavaScript code inside a frameset document. This makes it a perfect “control center” for all of the JavaScript code associated with a site. In fact, many sites actually place their JavaScript code in a “hidden” frame. For example:     <frame name=”prodInfo” src=”welcome.htm” scrolling=”yes” frameborder=”no”>  <frame name=”cart” src=”cart.htm” scrolling=”yes” frameborder=”no”>      The second frame has a height of zero pixels, so it will be hidden from view. The author of the site could then place all of her JavaScript code into the cart.htm file where it would be a bit safer from prying eyes.  Protecting your JavaScript source code  One of the biggest concerns professional programmers have had about JavaScript is “How can I protect my source code?” Unfortunately, this is almost impossible to   4804-2 Ch23.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 289  Session 23—Working with Frames  289  do. Since JavaScript is just plain text, it’s easy for users to see it simply by using the “View Source” or “View Frame Source” of their Web browser.  Even hiding your code in a hidden frame offers no real protection. A determined  user could simply view the source of your frameset document and then load the file specified in the src= attribute of your hidden frame. So, if your JavaScript code is going to contain trade secrets, you should seriously consider rewriting it as a server-side process.  Dealing with Improperly Loaded Frames  One reason some users dislike frames is that, when they bookmark a frames-based site, they often end up bookmarking an individual page from within a frame and not the site itself. However, with the addition of a few lines of JavaScript to each page of a site, this problem is fairly easy to overcome. If I add these lines to the top of the welcome.htm file:  if  parent == self  {  document.location.href = “index.htm”; }  When the page loads, it will check to see if the parent object is equal to the  window object that the document is loaded into. If these are equal, you know that there is no frameset present, which means that the welcome.htm file was loaded all by itself. If this is the case, the statement document.location.href = “index.htm”; will force the Web browser to immediately load the index.htm file. This in turn will set the site up appropriately in the browser window.  Of course, if your site is extremely complex, users will want a bookmark to  return them directly to the page they were on. They’ll also want the other frames of the site to reappear containing the pages that were loaded when the site was bookmarked. This is a bit more difficult to accomplish.  Unfortunately, most browsers only store the Web address of the frameset docu-  ment when a frames-based Web site is bookmarked. So, perhaps the best way to provide this functionality is to supply a button on your site that, when clicked, will create a cookie detailing which pages are visible in each frame. When the user returns to the site, this cookie can be examined and the proper pages reloaded into the appropriate frames.  S e s s i o n   2 3  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch23.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 290  290  Sunday Morning  Modifying Frame Sizes  The last frame-based trick I’d like to share with you is how to use JavaScript to change the size of the frames that are on the screen.  Note that this trick relies on CSS and at least one nonstandard field of the element object. As such, it only works in the latest versions of Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.   When you go to an e-commerce site, there’s usually a shopping cart icon that you can click to view what’s in your shopping cart. This usually loads a new page showing the contents of your cart. Then, to go back to what you were doing, you have to hit the back button and wait for the page to reload. Wouldn’t it be nice if the shopping cart display could be placed in a hidden frame that, when you wanted to view it, would pop up and then go away when you were through with it? Here’s one way you can make this happen.  var frameSetElement = parent.document.getElementById     function toggleCart  turnOn  {  “bpFrames” ;  if  turnOn  {  frameSetElement.rows = “40%,*”;  } else {  }  }  frameSetElement.rows = “100%,*”;       <frame id=”prodInfo” name=”prodInfo” src=”bpMenu.htm” scrolling=”yes” frameborder=”no”>  <frame id=”cart” name=”cart” src=”bpCart.htm” scrolling=”yes” frameborder=”no”>      Here I’ve defined a frameset with two frames in it. However, I’ve also given it an  ID of bpFrames. This ID information is used by the toggleCart   function to either hide or show the second frame based on the Boolean value that’s passed to the function. The toggleCart   function itself is very simple. It uses the   4804-2 Ch23.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 291  Session 23—Working with Frames  291  getElementById   method to retrieve the element object that represents the bpFrames frameset. It then makes a simple assignment to the rows property of the element object. Changing this property actually resizes the frames in the frameset to match the new sizes specified.  Yes, there’s also a cols property that does exactly the same thing for the columns in a frameset.    So, if the turnOn parameter is true, the rows property is set to 40%,*, which  shrinks the size of the top row to just 40 percent of the visible browser window and lets the second row take up the remaining space. If the turnOn parameter is false, the rows property is set to 100%,0, which expands the top row to com- pletely fill the visible browser window and sets the height of the second row to zero pixels. With this code in place, all I need is a couple of buttons or links that will call the toggleCart   function and pass it an appropriate value for the turnOn parameter. Assuming that the toggleCart   function will be a part of the frameset document, this code might look something like this.   Show Cart    Hide Cart   REVIEW  In this session, you learned how JavaScript views frames and how JavaScript state- ments can be written to work across frame boundaries. You also learned how to dynamically create a new document inside a frame as well as how to make sure that the contents of a frame are completely loaded and parsed. You’ve also learned how to determine if a page from a frameset has been loaded outside of its frame and how to react to fix that situation. Finally, you learned how to use JavaScript and the element object to dynamically change the size of frames in a frameset.  To tie all of these concepts together I’ve updated the Baby-Palooza.com shopping cart to work from inside a set of frames. To see this new version, load the index.htm file from the Session23 folder on your CD-ROM. When the page loads, you should only see a single frame. Click the Show Cart link and the shopping cart frame should appear at the bottom of the browser window. After you’ve played with this a bit, begin browsing through the source code to see how all the concepts from this ses- sion fit together with the things you’ve learned in previous sessions.

This includes the ability to create your own browser windows and fill them with whatever content you see fit.  Opening a New Browser Window  In Session 8, I briefly introduced you to the window.open   method. This method opens a new browser window and returns the window object that represents it. As mentioned in Session 8, window.open   can take up to four parameters in the fol- lowing order:  cid:2  url: This is the Web address of a Web page that you want to automatically   cid:2  name: This is a string that will be placed into the window.name property of  load into the new window.  the new window.  ✔  4804-2 Ch24.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 294  294  Sunday Morning   cid:2  featuresList: This is a string specifying what features the new window  should have. With this parameter, you can specify how big the window should be, if it should have toolbars, scroll bars, and so on.  We’ll be dis- cussing these features in the “Using the window features list” section below.    cid:2  replace: This is a Boolean value that specifies if the Web address specified  in the first parameter should replace the current entry in the Web browser’s history list.  Of course, if all you want is a new window with nothing in it, you don’t have to pass any parameters to the window.open   method at all. For example, the follow- ing code will create an empty browser window and assign the object that repre- sents it to a variable:  var blankWindow = window.open  ;  On the other hand, if you want your new window to automatically have some con- tent appear in it, you just pass the Web address of the page you want loaded into the window.  var hungryMindsSite = window.open  “http:  www.hungryminds.com” ;  Giving your window a name  As you saw in Session 8, window objects have a name property. The second parame- ter of the window.open   method lets you set this property as the window is being created. For example, the following creates an empty window with its name property set to “cartWin”.  var cartWin = window.open  “”, “cartWin” ;  Note that you aren’t required to give your new window a name when you create  it. If you want, you can set it later:  var cartWin = window.open  ; cartWin.name = “cartWin”;  In these examples, I’ve set the name property of my new window object to be exactly the same as the JavaScript variable name that holds the object.  As you learned in Session 20, this isn’t necessary, but it can be helpful when dynamically creating JavaScript code.  Setting the name property of the windows you create is completely optional. But, if you plan on having several windows open at once, it’s a good idea to name them all, just to help differentiate among them.   4804-2 Ch24.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 295  Session 24—Working with Windows  295  Using the window features list  If you only use the first two parameters of the window.open   method, the win- dows you open will all look exactly alike. They’ll all have a toolbar, a menu bar, scroll bars, and all the other accoutrements of a standard Web browser. If you want your new window to look a bit different, you have to specify the features you want  and don’t want  by using the featuresList parameter. The featuresList para- meter is a string that can contain one or more feature flags. These flags are sepa- rated by commas and look something like this:  “feature1=yes,feature2=no,feature3=no”  Table 24-1, shows each feature flag along with its possible values.   Table 24-1 Feature Flags for Use With the window.open   Method  Flag Name directories  Possible Values yes or no  Usage Specifies if the window should have a set of directory buttons.

Note that this will not apply to Macintosh Web browsers.   Specifies if the user should be able to resize the window or not.  Note that there is no “e” in the middle of “resizable”!   scrollbars  yes or no  Specifies if the window should have scroll bars.

Specifies if the window should have a main toolbar.  This is the toolbar containing the Forward and Back arrows, the Reload and Stop buttons, and so on.   So, if I want to create an empty window with a status bar and scroll bars, I  would code:  var cartWin = window.open  “”, “cartWin”, “status=yes,scrollbars=yes” ;  If you execute this code, you’ll notice that the window created has only a status bar and a scroll bar; none of the other window controls appear at all! This is because, when you specify a featuresList parameter, any features that you don’t list are automatically given a value of no.  Except, of course, for the height and width features. If you don’t give values for those, the new window will be the same height and or width as the window that creates it.  So, if you create a win- dow using just the height and width features, like this:  var cartWin = window.open  “”, “cartWin”, “height=100,width=200” ;  All you will get is a small window with a title bar and whatever window controls  are provided by the host operating system  such as a close box . This behavior might seem a bit odd at first, but it actually makes the creation of custom win- dows much easier. This is simply because, when it comes to customized windows, it’s usually quicker to list the things you do want rather than all the things you don’t want.  Creating Content in a New Window  Once you’ve got a new window open, you’ll probably want to put some content in it. Of course, you could just use the url parameter of the window.open   call to load an HTML document into the new window when it opens. But, if you need to create a custom document in your new window, you might find it easier to rely on document.write   calls.   4804-2 Ch24.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 297  Session 24—Working with Windows  297  The process for creating content in a different window is almost exactly the same  as the process for creating content in a different frame. The only difference is that instead of going through a parent or top object, you simply go through the win- dow object that represents the new window. For example, if I wanted to create a new window that simply says “Hello World!,” the code shown here will do the trick.  var greetWin = window.open  “”, “greetWin”, “height=100,width=200” ; greetWin.document.open  ; greetWin.document.write  “  ” ; greetWin.document.write  “Hello World!” ; greetWin.document.write  “  ” ; greetWin.document.close  ;  As you can see, this is pretty much the same thing that you saw in the last ses- sion. First, I open up my new window and store the object that represents it in the greetWin variable. Next, the greetWin.document.open   call opens a stream into the document object inside the new window. At this point, it’s a simple matter of making several document.write   calls to output the content I want to appear in the new window. After that, I call document.close   to cut off the stream and force the content to be shown in the window.  As with frames, it’s very important that you remember to write out everything  that’s needed to create a complete HTML document. This includes sets of    and    tags as well as any attributes that you want included with those tags.  Communicating between Windows  As you saw in the last session, frame-to-frame communication between JavaScript programs isn’t all that difficult. So, given that frames are really just windows,  window-to-window communication should be fairly easy as well, right? Well, yes, it is, but there is a small difference. As you’ve just seen, when one window  which I’ll call the “Parent”  opens another  which I’ll call the “Child” , the Parent window can easily access the methods  and properties and functions and global variables  of the Child window simply by working through the window object it got back from the window.open   method. However, the Child window doesn’t have a way to automatically access its Parent window.  In particular, it doesn’t have a parent object to work with as a frame would.   S e s s i o n   2 4  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch24.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 298  298  Sunday Morning  To solve this problem, every window object includes an opener property  which  I briefly discussed in Session 8 . If a window was opened by some other window, its opener property will contain a window object that represents its Parent. By working through the opener property, a Child window can access any of the objects, functions, or variables defined in the Parent window.  Of course, if a win- dow was not opened by the window.open   call, its opener property will be null.  The following bit of JavaScript  opens a new window and defines a simple function  this is in the listing24-2.htm file .   var childWin = window.open  “childWin.htm”, “childWin” ; function doGreeting  theGreeting  {  alert  “The kid says: ‘“ + theGreeting + “‘“ ; }  This new window will automatically be loaded with the childWin.htm document:        Calling a Window’s opener    if  self.opener != null  {  self.opener.doGreeting  “Hello from the new window!” ; }             If you load the listing24-2.htm file into your Web browser, you’ll see the Child  window open and then a moment later you’ll get an alert saying “The kid says: ‘Hello from the new window!’”. This shows that, with its opener in hand, a Child window can access any of the methods, properties, functions, or global variables that are defined in its Parent.  Solving the timing problem for windows  In Session 23, you learned that if the JavaScript in one frame tries to call a func- tion in another frame and that second frame isn’t fully loaded yet, an error could occur. This same timing problem can rear its head when working with multiple windows. If a Parent window tries to call a function or fill in a form field in a Child   4804-2 Ch24.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 299  Session 24—Working with Windows  299  window before that Child window is fully loaded, you’ll probably be rewarded with a “not defined” error. But, since windows and frames are so similar, the solution to this problem is similar as well. Again, I’ll assume that there’s a function that I need to call in my Child window as soon as possible after the window opens. The following shows the HTML file that will be loaded into my Child window.  This is from the ads.htm file on your CD-ROM.        An Ad!    body { background-color:white }     function showAd   {  alert “Please support our sponsors!” ; }        This might as well be a pop-up ad!            As with frames, the key to solving this problem is to place a dummy form at the  end of the document you are loading. This next bit of JavaScript shows the code from my Parent window that will make sure my Child window is completely loaded.  function doAdShow   {  var tryAgain = true; if   adWin != null  {  if  adWin.document != null  {  if  adWin.document.forms.length > 0  {  adWin.showAd  ; tryAgain = false; }  }  }  S e s s i o n   2 4  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch24.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 300  300  Sunday Morning  if  tryAgain  {  setTimeout  ‘doAdShow  ’, 1000 ; }  }  var adWin = window.open  “ads.htm”, “adWin”, “height=100,width=200” ;    Attempt to call a function inside the Child window doAdShow  ;  Here again, the solution is remarkably similar to the solution for frames. After  opening my Child window, I call the doAdShow   function. This function uses a series of if statements to make sure that the window and its document object exist, and that the last form in the window has been loaded and parsed by the JavaScript interpreter. Only when all of these conditions are true does the func- tion actually call the showAd   function inside the Child window. If even one of these conditions is false, the function uses a setTimeout   call to try again one second later.  Using the document.domain property  Thus far, all of the windows you’ve seen have been able to communicate with one another quite easily. However, there is one situation where JavaScript actually pro- hibits windows from communicating. If your JavaScript code resides in two HTML documents that come from different servers, the JavaScript in these documents will not be able to communicate. This is done in order to provide a basic level of security for your JavaScript code. After all, you certainly wouldn’t want a bit of JavaScript code from “evil-crackers.com” to be able to talk to the JavaScript code on your Web site! The downside to this however, is that even if your code exists in the same domain yet on different servers  such as “www.baby-palooza.com” and “support.baby-palooza.com” , communication is still prohibited. Fortunately, a solution exists in the form of the document.domain property. Initially, this prop- erty will hold the domain and subdomain name of the Web server that the HTML document came from. For example, if you were to load “http:  www.baby-palooza. com index.htm” into your Web browser, the document.domain property for this document would be “www.baby-palooza.com.”  Now, if a bit of JavaScript code inside this file wanted to open and then   communicate with a the contents of the file at “http:  support.baby-palooza.com  problemForm. htm,” both of these files would need to establish that they were in the same domain before they would be allowed to communicate.  Note that,  since I don’t know what kind of setup you actually have and since neither   4804-2 Ch24.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 301  Session 24—Working with Windows  301  “www.baby-palooza.com” or “support.baby-palooza.com” actually exits, I’m just going to give you the code that would be required to pull this off and then you can adapt it to your own network set up.   In the index.htm file on the “www” server, you might have some code like this:  var readyToTalk = false; var probFormWin = window.open  “http:  support.baby- palooza.com problemForm.htm”, “probFormWin” ; self.document.domain = “baby-palooza.com”;  Then, in the problemForm.htm file  on the “support” server , you might have this:  self.document.domain = “baby-palooza.com”;    and then at the bottom of the file . . . self.opener.readyToTalk = true;  The key to this entire process is in the statement  self.document.domain = “baby-palooza.com”;  which appears in both files. This tells the JavaScript interpreter that both of these HTML documents belong to the same domain and should be allowed to communicate. But you’re probably thinking, “What’s to stop the folks at ‘evil-cracker.com’ from set- ting the domain properties of their documents to ‘baby-palooza.com’?” Actually, the JavaScript interpreter is what’s stopping them! You see the JavaScript interpreter will only let you set the domain property to the domain suffix that the document originated from. So, a document that comes from “www.evil-crackers.com” can only have its domain property set to “evil-crackers.com” and not “baby-palooza.com”  or anything else for that matter .  Closing Your Windows  Once you are done with a window, you can either allow the user to close it or you can close it yourself with a call to the window.close   method. Using the window. close   method is fairly straightforward; you call it and the window in question disappears.  cid:2  If your JavaScript code creates a Child window and then tries to close it,  the Child window should disappear without a fuss.  S e s s i o n   2 4  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch24.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 302  302  Sunday Morning   cid:2  If your JavaScript code creates a Child window and then the Child window  tries to close itself, this too should work precisely the way you expect.  cid:2  If your JavaScript code, running in any window, tries to close either its  Parent window or the first browser window you opened, you will get a dia- log asking you to confirm the closing of the window. This is a security fea- ture designed to prevent malicious JavaScript programs from shutting down a user’s Web browser  which means that there’s really no way to get around it .  REVIEW  In this session, you learned how to open new windows with the window.open   method. You also learned about all of the different parameters that can be passed to the window.open   method to create a window with exactly the features that you want  a menu bar, scroll bars, etc. . You learned that dynamically creating con- tent in a new window is done in almost exactly the same way as with frames. You saw how easy it is, using the window.opener property to create two-way communi- cations between Parent and Child windows. This allows the JavaScript in one win- dow to access the objects, functions, and global variables in another window. You learned how HTML documents from different servers are forbidden to talk to one another, unless they have the same value in their document.domain properties. Finally, you learned how to close windows using the window.close   method.  QUIZ YOURSELF  1. Why give your new windows names?  See “Giving your window a name.”  2.

But, even though it doesn’t need much more functionality, it could use a few tweaks to make it easier to use. So, in  this session, I’m going to show you several ways that you can use JavaScript, HTML, and Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  to make your Web pages easier for your users to understand and use.  As with the other CSS-based tricks I’ve shown you, not all of the things discussed in this session will currently work with all browsers. However, this should be corrected in future browser releases.   Using Visual Cues  Today’s Web is largely a visual medium. Because of this, and the fact that the most popular operating systems are graphics-based, users have become a bit lazy,  ✔ ✔  4804-2 Ch25.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 304  304  Sunday Morning  expecting the way things work to be obvious with just a glance.  Of course, all Web pages work in pretty much the same way, but it’s still quite easy to create a Web site that can confuse even the most veteran of users.   Highlighting your links  One of the most fundamental things you can do for your users is to make sure that they can tell what is a link and what isn’t. By convention, a Web browser will underline a link and draw it in a color that’s different from the surrounding text. However, if you have a bit of ordinary text that you want to underline, this can still lead to some confusion on the part of the user. Fortunately, CSS makes it easy to set up your links so that they will change color when the mouse passes over them. This creates a simple visual cue for users that tells them that the text in question is a link they can click. To set this up, all you have to do is define a CSS rule like this:  a:hover { color:red }  With this rule, you’re telling the browser that, when the mouse hovers over a  set of    tags, it should change the color of the text inside to red. While this is fairly obvious, the :hover designation is something that you haven’t seen before. It’s not a class definition, and it’s not an ID definition, so what is it?  Well, the : in this rule marks it as a CSS pseudoclass. CSS pseudoclasses can be thought of as “convenience” classes. They represent common situations where you might want to change the appearance of an element. In this case, I’m changing the appearance of a link when the mouse hovers over it.  If you think this sounds like an image rollover as seen in Session 14, you are right, except the whole thing is managed by CSS and the browser.   There are several other CSS pseudoclasses. However, as I write this, the current crop of browsers supports only a handful of them. For more on these other pseudoclasses, be sure to visit the CSS documentation page at www.w3.org TR REC-CSS2 .  Tip  Emulating :hover with JavaScript  According to the CSS documentation, the :hover pseudoclass will, one day, work with any HTML element. As of right now though, it only seems to work with    tags. This is unfortunate because the hover effect is a great way to let users know that what they have the mouse over is actually a control of some sort.   4804-2 Ch25.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 305  Session 25—Improving the User Interface  305  In fact, it’s such a good user interface tool, that it’s worth a little time and JavaScript to emulate it for the other elements on a Web page. For example, in my shopping cart, it would be nice if the + and - controls became highlighted when the mouse hovered over them.  Because these controls are implemented as images, one of the few ways I can  highlight them  without drawing new images and creating a rollover  is to draw a border around them as the mouse passes over. You might remember however, that I defined these images without borders in my HTML document. So, the first thing I have to do is change my   tags so that they have borders. Of course, if I change the   tag directly, I’ll end up with black borders that show up all the time. So, instead of changing the   tag for each of my controls, I’ll define a CSS class like this:  img.button { border-style:solid;border-color:white;border- width:1px }  Then, I can change my   tag definitions to make use of this class, like so:      Note that I’ve omitted most of the contents of the   tag to save space.  This will create a class of images that all have a solid, white border that’s one pixel wide.  And, because my background color is also white, this border will be effec- tively invisible. Of course, you could use DHTML to add a border on the fly. But, if you do this, your images will jump up and down on the page as the border is added and taken away by your DHTML code. You get a much nicer effect if you start with an invisible border.   At this point, it’s a simple matter of creating a rollover effect similar to the one  that you saw in Session 14. However, instead of swapping images, this rollover effect will actually be changing the style applied to my element. Since this is a bit more complex than an image swap, I’m going to define a couple of new methods to handle the effect.     This method highlights an element by turning its border red function shopCart_doHilightBorder  theID  {  var theElement = document.getElementById  theID ; theElement.style.borderColor = “red”; }     This method removes the border highlight from an element function shopCart_doDimBorder  theID  {  var theElement = document.getElementById  theID ; theElement.style.borderColor = “white”; }  S e s s i o n   2 5  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch25.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 306  306  Sunday Morning  As you can see, each of these methods takes an element ID string and uses it to  retrieve the element object for that ID. It then sets the borderColor property of that element’s style to either red or white, depending on whether or not the ele- ment is being highlighted or dimmed. Of course, I still need to tie these methods to my image controls. As always, simply specifying the proper event handlers does this.  <img name=’plus_st-001’ src=’.. images plus.jpg’ class=’button’ onmouseover=”bpCart.hilightBorder ‘plus_st-001’ ” onmouseout=”bpCart.dimBorder ‘plus_st-001’ ”  >  With this code in place for all of my + and - controls, moving the mouse over  any of these controls will result in the control being highlighted with a red border. When the mouse moves away, the border color will become white and the highlight will disappear.  If you are using a Macintosh or Netscape 6, you might find that this code generates errors when you pass the mouse over the + and - controls. You’ll learn how to work around this in the next session.  Note  Visual cues for text boxes  While the JavaScript-based hover effect shown above can be used for any type of element, it’s especially useful for text boxes. You can even use the same code that you just saw. All you have to do is define the appropriate event handlers as shown here.  Again, I’ve left out some of the tag’s code to save space and focus on the relevant bits.   <input type=’text’ id=’inCart_st-001’ name=’inCart_st-001’ onmouseover=”bpCart.hilightBorder ‘inCart_st-001’ ” onmouseout=”bpCart.dimBorder ‘inCart_st-001’ ” value=’0’ size=’6’  >  With these handlers in place, my “inCart” text boxes will be highlighted in red  as the mouse moves over them.  Remember, text boxes already have a border around them, so there’s no need for a special CSS rule.   Highlighting the active text box Another CSS pseudoclass that doesn’t seem to work at the moment is the :focus pseudoclass. This class lets you determine how an element should look when it has the focus. This is another very useful pseudoclass, so, once again, a little   4804-2 Ch25.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 307  Session 25—Improving the User Interface  307  JavaScript will allow me to emulate it until the browser world catches up to the standard. The next bit of code shows two new methods that I’ve defined for the shopping cart object. These let me change the style of a text box that currently has the focus.  function shopCart_doFocusInCart  partNo  {  var tFieldElement = document.getElementById  ‘inCart_’ +  partNo ; tFieldElement.style.borderStyle = “ridge”; tFieldElement.style.backgroundColor = “dddddd”; eval  “document.” + this.cartForm + “.elements[‘inCart_” +   partNo + “‘].select  ” ;  }  function shopCart_doBlurInCart  partNo  {  var tFieldElement = document.getElementById  ‘inCart_’ +  partNo ; tFieldElement.style.borderStyle = “inset”; tFieldElement.style.backgroundColor = “white”; }  And here is the definition of a text box that uses these methods, along with the highlighting methods discussed earlier.  <input type=’text’ id=’inCart_st-001’ name=’inCart_st-001’ onfocus=’bpCart.focusInCart “st-001” ’ onblur=’bpCart.blurInCart “st-001” ’ onmouseover=”bpCart.hilightBorder ‘inCart_st-001’ ” onmouseout=”bpCart.dimBorder ‘inCart_st-001’ ” onchange=’bpCart.enterQuantity “st-001” ’ value=’0’ size=’6’  >  When this text box gets the focus, the focusInCart   method will change the  border style of the text box to a value of ridge. This will give the text box a slightly raised appearance. Then it will change the background color to dddddd. This is a fairly light gray color that will show that the box has the focus, without overpowering the text in the box.  Finally, the focusInCart   method uses the eval   function to call the  select   method of the text box. This method selects all of the text in the text box. So, when the user begins to type, what she types will automatically replace the previous contents of the box.  S e s s i o n   2 5  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch25.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 308  308  Sunday Morning  When the text box loses the focus, the blurInCart   method will reset the  border style of the text box back to inset and then change the box’s background color back to white. Of course, you can modify this handler to apply whatever styles you wish to your text boxes.  Eliminating visual cues from read-only text boxes As it stands now, there is one very confusing aspect to my shopping cart: Some text boxes can be typed in and some can’t. Specifically, users can type into the Quantity Ordered boxes, but they can’t type into the Quantity On Hand or Grand Total boxes.  As you saw in Session 22, it is possible to use JavaScript and DHTML to com- pletely remove these text boxes from the screen and replace them with sets of    tags that could be updated to reflect new totals. However, this would be a lot of work to do something that text boxes already do very well: dis- play text.  Instead of removing the text boxes, why not simply remove the visual cues that tell the user that they are text boxes? Thanks to years of conditioning, most users recognize a text box from three simple visual cues: a flashing insertion point  when the text box has the focus , an I-beam cursor  when the mouse is over a text box , and a distinctive border. Take these cues away, and most users will never know that they are looking at a text box.  The insertion point is already taken care of. If you’ll remember, back in Session  15, you saw how the onfocus event  and the focus   method  could be used to keep the insertion point from ever landing in a text box that you wanted to write- protect.  Taking care of the last two cues is even easier. Both the I-beam cursor and the  distinctive text box border can be eliminated simply by defining an appropriate CSS class and then applying it to the text boxes you want. For example, here’s the CSS class definition.  input.noEdit { border-style:none; cursor:default }  And here’s the definition of a text box that belongs to this class.  <input type=’text’ class=’noEdit’ name=’quan_st-001’ onfocus=”document.bpCart_form.elements[‘inCart_st-001’].focus  ” value=’5’ size=’6’  >  The only thing new here is the cursor part of my CSS class. The cursor rule tells  the browser what kind of mouse pointer to display when the mouse is over an ele- ment. In this case, I’ve told it to use the default pointer, which, in most operating   4804-2 Ch25.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 309  Session 25—Improving the User Interface  309  systems, is a standard arrow pointer.  Other values that you can use for cursor include: crosshair, wait, and help. You can even define your own cursors and have the browser use those!  So, when the browser draws text boxes of this class, they will have no border and when the mouse passes over them, the pointer won’t change into an I-beam. However, since these are still text boxes, you can still change their values with a simple JavaScript statement. Figure 25-1 shows how this appears in the browser window.  Figure 25-1 Text boxes without borders  Using the status bar  If you have a Web page that’s full of links, controls, and images, it’s a good bet that even the savviest of users may have some trouble figuring out what every- thing does. So, it’s become a fairly standard practice to give users a clue via a short message in the status bar at the bottom of the browser.  Yes, you’ve seen this before, but it’s such an important technique, I wanted to include it here as well.  For example, in Session 23, I defined a couple of links to show and hide the frame that contains my shopping cart. Those links looked like this:   Show Cart   Hide Cart   If you held the mouse over one of these links, you’d see the status bar change to display the actual JavaScript statement that will be executed when the link is clicked. While this is extremely detailed information about what the link does, it isn’t in the friendliest form.  S e s s i o n   2 5  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch25.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 310  310  Sunday Morning  The solution is to use an onmouseover event handler to change the contents of  the status bar to something a bit more descriptive.  <a href=”javascript:parent.toggleCart true ” onmouseover=”window.status=’View your shopping cart...’;return true;”>Show Cart  <a href=”javascript:parent.toggleCart false ” onmouseover=”window.status=’Hide your shopping cart...’;return true;”>Hide Cart   Now, when the mouse enters one of these links, the status bar will be changed  to display a nice friendly message that tells the user exactly what will happen when they click the link.  Don’t forget to add the return true; statement to the end of your event handler. Without it, your custom message won’t appear!   Tip  One of the more annoying aspects of using a complex Web page with lots of controls is the way the tab key works. By default, the Web browser will tab from control to control in the order that the controls were defined in the HTML document. Unfortunately, this might not match the way the controls are arranged on the screen. This can lead to lots of confusion as the user repeatedly hits the tab key only to have the focus jump to a control on a completely different part of the page. To solve this problem, HTML controls can be given a tabIndex attribute. This attribute lets you specify the order that you want the controls on your page to be accessed via the tab key. Simply give the first control a tabIndex of 1, the second a tabIndex of 2, and so on. If there are any controls that you want the tab key to skip over, give them a tabIndex of 0.  Correcting the Display of Floating-Point Numbers  If you haven’t noticed by now, there’s something seriously wrong with the way my shopping cart displays floating-point numbers. If you haven’t caught it yet, take a good look at the grand total shown in Figure 25-1. According to my calculations, the value displayed should be $50.85. However, what I’ve got showing is $50.8499999.  Believe it or not, this value is actually correct; at least as far as JavaScript is  concerned. You see, JavaScript stores numbers internally in binary  base 2  format. While binary is great for storing integers, it’s slightly less adept at representing   4804-2 Ch25.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 311  Session 25—Improving the User Interface  311  floating-point values. Because of this, the simple act of adding a couple of float- ing-point numbers together can lead to errors like the one you see here.  It’s very important to note that, internally, the value calculated will be correct. In other words, this problem will not affect any floating-point calculations that you perform in your JavaScript program. The only thing that’s affected is the display of floating point numbers.  Note  Unfortunately, the only real fix for this problem is to write a custom function  that will truncate floating-point numbers to an appropriate number of digits before they are displayed. On the plus side, once you’ve got this function written, you can use it for all of the floating-point numbers you want to display. You’ll find the following function in the floatingPoint.js file on your CD-ROM:  function twoDecimals  theNum  {  var result = “”;    Change the number to a string for manipulation var fpString = theNum + “”;    find the decimal point var decimalAt = fpString.indexOf  “.” ;    if there is no decimal point, add one along with two zeroes if  decimalAt == -1  {  result = fpString + “.00”; } else {     pull off the fractional part var frac = fpString.substring  decimalAt ;    multipy it by 100 frac = parseFloat  frac  * 100;    Round this new number off frac = Math.round  frac ;    and use it to rebuild our two decimal places    and return the result var wholeNum = fpString.substring  0, decimalAt  result = wholeNum + “.” + frac; }  return result; }  In this listing, I’ve defined a simple function that accepts a floating-point num- ber and returns it rounded to two decimal places. The function starts by changing the number into a string  by concatenating it with the empty string . At that  S e s s i o n   2 5  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch25.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 312  312  Sunday Morning  point, the indexOf   method is used to determine if there is already a decimal point in the string. If there isn’t, the function simply appends a decimal place and two zeros to the end of the string and returns that as its result.  If there is a decimal point, things get a bit more interesting. First, the frac-  tional part of the number  along with the decimal place  is stripped off and stored in the frac variable. I then use the parseFloat   function to convert the string in frac into an actual floating-point number. As you can see, the parseFloat   function does for floating-point numbers what the parseInt   function  dis- cussed in Session 15  does for integer numbers. However, unlike the parseInt   function, there is no base parameter to worry with; the parseFloat   function only accepts decimal values.  This new floating-point value is then multiplied by 100. This effectively shifts  the decimal place two digits to the right. So, if frac was originally “.84999999994” it will now be “84.999999994”.  I can now use the Math.round   method to round this to the nearest whole  number  in the above example that would be “85” . As you might guess, the Math object is an object that’s built into JavaScript. It provides various and sundry math- ematical constants and methods that you can use to manipulate numbers in your JavaScript program.  I’ll be discussing this object in more detail in Session 27.  Unfortunately, the Math object does not include a method that lets you round a floating-point number to a certain number of decimal places. So, you have to resort to trickery like what’s shown here to get a properly rounded floating-point number.  Once I have my fractional part correctly rounded, I simply reattach it to the whole number portion of my original number and return this result to whoever called the function. In the case of my shopping cart, the who that will call this function will be the shopCart.calcGrandTotal   method. Fortunately, only one line has to change in this method to support this function:  eval  “document.” + this.cartForm + “.elements[‘grandTotal’].value = twoDecimals  grandTotal ” ;  With this code in place, my shopping cart will now calculate and display all of its floating-point values correctly.  REVIEW  In this session, you saw how easy it is to use JavaScript and CSS to add visual cues to your Web site. If used properly, these cues can help visitors to your Web site understand and use it more effectively. One group of visual cues you learned about was the CSS pseudoclasses. While these don’t yet work in all browsers, you saw   4804-2 Ch25.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 313  Session 25—Improving the User Interface  313  that JavaScript can be used to emulate some of the more useful of these pseudo- classes. You also learned how CSS can be used to remove visual cues from certain elements on the page  in this case, text boxes  to keep your users focused on only those elements that they can actually interact with. You revisited the process of displaying helpful information in the browser’s status bar. Finally, you learned about the problem JavaScript has with displaying certain floating-point numbers and how to correct it.  As you can see, learning to use JavaScript effectively in your Web pages isn’t just about learning JavaScript. More often than not, you need to be able to mix and match various technologies to achieve the effect you want. So, take a few moments to review all of the source code in the Session25 folder of your CD-ROM to see how all of these different things come together to create what you’ve seen in this session.

Everything you’ve seen so far should work in any browser that sup-  ports the ECMAScript, DOM Level 2, and CSS Level 2 standards.  While this is the way life should be, it hasn’t always been so nice. Until recently, writing JavaScript that did something useful, worked in both browsers, and only required one version of your code was nearly impossible. Although this has changed dramatically for the better, there still may be an occasion when you need to create a JavaScript program that’s tailored to one browser or another.  Properties of the navigator Object  The key to creating a JavaScript program that targets one browser or another is the window.navigator object. This object  which takes its name from the original   4804-2 Ch26.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 316  316  Sunday Morning  Netscape Navigator product  contains everything you need to determine which browser brand and version your program is executing in. Using the navigator object is actually pretty simple. You just look at the contents of one or more of the navigator object’s properties to determine the browser brand and version. Then, based on that information, you execute the code that you know will work in that browser.  The catch to this rather simple process is that, rather than following a strict  format for storing information in the navigator object, each browser vendor stores its data in a slightly different format. So, while you know that you can determine the browser version from the navigator object, how you make that determination is different for each browser. Before I actually show you how to pull this information from the navigator object, let me give you a quick rundown of its more useful properties.  Yes, there are other properties in the navigator object, but they are usually specific to one browser or another.   The appCodeName property  Programmers love code names. I suppose it’s because they make us feel like secret agents instead of the geeks we really are. Regardless of why, almost every com- puter program ever developed has had a code name. So, the navigator object con- tains an appCodeName property that is supposed to contain the code name that the browser was developed under. This is a simple String object, so it’s very easy to examine and use.  While this property might seem to be a great way to determine which browser you are using, it isn’t. You see, when Microsoft entered the browser market, they wanted to make sure their browser was as compatible as possible with Netscape Navigator  then the market leader . Unfortunately, a lot of scripts at the time relied on the value that they found in the appCodeName property. So, in order to break as few scripts as possible, all versions of Internet Explorer return exactly the same appCodeName as Netscape Navigator does: Mozilla.  Mozilla is the name of the original graphical Web browser. Almost every Web browser that has followed is based on it in one way or another. Mozilla is still being worked on to this day, and a great many people prefer it to the big-name browsers. To get a copy, visit the Mozilla organization’s home page at www.mozilla.org.   The appName property  While the appCodeName property isn’t of much use at all, the appName property is very useful indeed. If you examine it in a Netscape browser, you get back   4804-2 Ch26.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 317  Session 26—Working with Different Browsers  317  “Netscape.” If you examine it in Microsoft’s browser, you get back “Microsoft Internet Explorer.” Here again, this is a simple String object, so you can examine its contents easily:  The appVersion property  This is perhaps the most important property in the navigator object. As the name implies, it tells you what the version number is for the browser that your code is executing in. Unfortunately, how you interpret this information depends on which browser you are dealing with. I’ll be discussing this process in great detail in the section “Determining the Browser Version.” While you might expect this property to be a simple numeric value, it’s actually a String object.  The cookieEnabled property  This is a simple Boolean value that lets you determine whether or not cookies are enabled in the browser. This property is new to the latest versions of the major Web browsers, so if you need to check cookie availability in an older browser, don’t rely on the existence of this property.  See the cookiesActive   function in the cookies.js file for an example of how to check for cookie availability.   The language and userLanguage properties  These properties can tell you which language a visitor to your site has her Web browser set up to display. Note that the language property is only found in Netscape browsers while the userLanguage property is only found in Internet Explorer. You can check for the existence of one property or the other simply by comparing it to null.  This is similar to the trick used in Session 23 to determine if a frame’s contents were loaded.   if  navigator.language != null  {     work with Netscape language information }  if  navigator.userLanguage != null  {     work with Internet Explorer language information }  S e s s i o n   2 6  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch26.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 318  318  Sunday Morning  The mimeTypes array  This array contains a list of all the MIME types that are known to the client’s com- puter. MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. Originally, MIME types were used to identify the types of data that were included in e-mail attach- ments. This array is closely linked with the plugins array, which is mentioned later in this session. You’ll be learning much more about MIME types in Session 29, when you learn how to identify and use browser plug-ins and multimedia.  The platform property  In Session 21, you learned that the navigator.platform property contains a String object that tells you which computer platform the browser is running on. You can use this value to provide platform specific content for your visitors or to direct them to a site devoted to their computer platform. For an example of one way to use this property, see “Deciding Which Style Sheet to Use” in Session 21.  The plugins array  The plugins array contains a list of all of the plug-ins that are installed in the client’s Web browser. If you need to display a particular type of multimedia file  like an Acrobat PDF file or a QuickTime Movie  in the Web browser, you can search this array to see if the user has an appropriate plug-in installed. The plugins array is closely linked with the mimeTypes array  mentioned earlier , so you’ll be hearing more about both of them in Session 29 when you learn about multimedia.  The userAgent property  Traditionally, this property has simply contained a combination of the appCodeName and appVersion properties, with the two values separated by a forward-slash  . However, the Netscape 6 browser now includes some additional information dealing with its HTML rendering engine  which is named Gecko .  This information is also found in two Netscape 6-specific properties: navigator.product and navigator. productSub. At this point it’s unclear how you might use this information, but it’s in there if the need should arise.    4804-2 Ch26.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 319  Session 26—Working with Different Browsers  319  Determining the Browser Version  Looking at the properties of the navigator object, you might be thinking, “Gosh, it looks like determining the browser version is simple!” Well, it certainly should be. But, as I said earlier, each of the browser vendors stores their version informa- tion in a slightly different format. So, while it is very simple to determine which browser you are using  via the appName property  and which platform your code is running on  via the platform property  getting down to the browser version is a little tricky. For example, here is the value of navigator.appVersion from Netscape Navigator 6 on the Macintosh.  5.0  Macintosh; en-US   And here is the value of navigator.appVersion from Internet Explorer 5 on the Macintosh.  4.0  compatible; MSIE 5.0; Macintosh; I; PPC   Extracting Netscape version information  The Netscape information is fairly straightforward: it’s the actual version number of the browser  remember, there never was an official Netscape 5 release, but the internal version for Netscape 6 is actually 5.0 , followed in parentheses by plat- form and language information. So, extracting the version number from this infor- mation is actually pretty simple, as shown here:  var versionNum = “”; if  navigator.appName == “Netscape”  {  var fParen = navigator.appVersion.indexOf  “ “ ; if  fParen != -1  {  versionNum = navigator.appVersion.substring  0, fParen ; versionNum = parseFloat  versionNum, 10 ; } else {  document.write  “Could not determine version number!<br   >” ; document.write  “The appVersion property contains:<br   >” ; document.write  navigator.appVersion ; }  S e s s i o n   2 6  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch26.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 320  320  } else {  Sunday Morning  document.write  “This is not a Netscape Browser!” ; }  if  versionNum != “”  {  document.write  “You are using version “ + versionNum + “ of “   + navigator.appName ;  }  As you can see, this is pretty simple. After checking to see that this is indeed a  Netscape browser, the code finds the location of the first parenthesis in the appVersion property. This location is then used by the substring   method to extract the actual version number. But, before substring   is called, the code checks to make sure that the first parenthesis was really found. If it wasn’t, the code displays an error message telling the user that the version number of the browser could not be obtained.  It’s important to check for this because, while rare, it is possible to change the information in the appVersion property with browser-customization software. So, it’s a good idea to make sure the version infor- mation is in the proper format before you base any decisions on that information.   Extracting Internet Explorer version information  Now that you know how to get the version information from a Netscape browser, it probably seems like a pretty simple task to extract the same information from Internet Explorer. Well, let’s take another look at what you actually get from the appVersion property for Internet Explorer 5 on the Macintosh:  4.0  compatible; MSIE 5.0; Macintosh; I; PPC   As you can see here, the version number is 4.0. But, unlike Netscape, Internet Explorer didn’t skip a version number so this should be version 5.0, right? Right. What you are seeing here is another example of how Microsoft wanted Internet Explorer to be as compatible with Netscape as possible. So, the first version num- ber in Internet Explorer’s appVersion property is the version number of Netscape that this version of Internet Explorer is compatible with! In other words, this is telling you that this browser is compatible with Netscape version 4.0. How then, do you tell which version of Internet Explorer this is? Well, it’s actually pretty easy once you know where to look.  If you’ll notice, right in the middle of this appVersion value is the string “MSIE  5.0.” This is what tells you which version of Internet Explorer you are dealing with. While this information is buried inside the appVersion property, it always   4804-2 Ch26.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 321  Session 26—Working with Different Browsers  321  starts with the characters “MSIE”  which stands for “Microsoft Internet Explorer” , so it’s actually pretty easy get:   var versionNum = “”; if  navigator.appName == “Microsoft Internet Explorer”  { var msieFlag = navigator.appVersion.indexOf  “MSIE” ; if  msieFlag != -1  {  var msieVersionEnd = navigator.appVersion.indexOf  “;”,  msieFlag ; versionNum = navigator.appVersion.substring  msieFlag + 4, msieVersionEnd ; versionNum = parseFloat  versionNum ; } else {  document.write  “Could not find version number! ” ; document.write  “The appVersion property is: ” ; document.write  navigator.appVersion ; }  } else {  document.write  “This is not Microsoft Internet Explorer!” ; }  document.write  “You are using version “ + versionNum + “ of “   if  versionNum != “”  {  + navigator.appName ;  }  This is almost exactly the same process as determining a Netscape version num-  ber. The only real difference is that you have to pull a string from the middle of the appVersion property rather than from its start.  Requiring a Certain Browser Version  If you create a Web site that uses some of the newer features of JavaScript or Cascading Style Sheets or even HTML, you will need to know when an incompatible browser comes a-calling. The choices here are the same as when you learned about cookie support in Session 16. If the client’s browser doesn’t support the features your site needs, you can either block them from using the site entirely or you can redirect them to a more appropriate version of your site.  S e s s i o n   2 6  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch26.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 322  322  Sunday Morning  Consider, for example, the site that I’ve been building throughout this book.  While it might seem fairly simple to someone that’s been reading along  at least I hope it does , it actually relies quite heavily on many tricks that are only available in the latest versions of the major Web browsers. So, if the site gets visitors who are using older browsers, rather than generate a bunch of errors, the polite thing to do is to tell them that they need to update their browser and provide them with the links to do so. With that in mind, I’ve created a set of functions that can be used to determine which browser, browser version, and platform my JavaScript code is executing in. These functions can all be found in the browserSnoop.js file which is in the Session26 folder on your CD-ROM. You’ve actually already seen  at one time or another  the code for all of the functions in this file, so in Table 26-1, you’ll find a brief rundown of each function and what it does.  Table 26-1 The Functions Defined in browserSnoop.js  Function Name isNetscape    isIE    getNetscapeVersion    Purpose Returns true if current browser is Netscape.  Returns true if current browser is Internet Explorer.  Returns the version of a Netscape browser.  If used with Internet Explorer, it returns the version of Netscape that the browser is compatible with.   getIEversion    Returns the version of an Internet Explorer browser.  isMac    isWin    isLinux    Returns true if the browser is running on a Macintosh.  Returns true if the browser is running on a Windows PC.  Returns true if the browser is running on a Linux box.  By using these functions together, you can easily determine what type of browser your JavaScript code is executing in and generate the content that is appropriate. As I said earlier, for the Baby-Palooza site, I want to tell users of older browsers that their browser isn’t compatible and give them links to download the latest browsers. So, I’ve placed this functionality into the index.htm file that’s in the Session26 folder on your CD-ROM. This code is a bit long, so open it up in your HTML editor and take a quick look at it. At first this code might look complicated, but if you study it for a bit, you’ll see that there really isn’t anything to this. A series of simple if statements determines if the current browser is either Netscape   4804-2 Ch26.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 323  Session 26—Working with Different Browsers  323  version 6+  by checking for a version number of 5 or greater  or Internet Explorer version 5+. If so, the variable browserOK is set to true. A final if statement uses the value of this variable to decide whether it should write out the <frame- set>  tags that will create the Web site or a simple “your browser is incompatible” document.  Creating Code for Specific Browsers  Even if you have the proper version of a browser, that browser still might not be able to support everything that you want it to do. For example, in the last session, I added a highlight outline to the + and - buttons in the shopping cart. I also included a rather cryptic note that, on the Macintosh and with this highlighting code in place, moving the mouse over those buttons might cause errors. The reason for this is, while this code works perfectly in Internet Explorer v5.5 on Windows, it doesn’t work in Internet Explorer v5 for the Macintosh. It also doesn’t work in Netscape 6! While the errors that are generated aren’t fatal, they certainly don’t look good.  Fortunately, once you know how to check the browser version and platform, it’s  incredibly easy to create code that only works in certain browsers. For example, here’s the code from the last session that’s causing the trouble.     This method highlights an element by turning its border red function shopCart_doHilightBorder  theID  {  var theElement = document.getElementById  theID ; theElement.style.borderColor = “red”; }     This method removes the border highlight from an element function shopCart_doDimBorder  theID  {  var theElement = document.getElementById  theID ; theElement.style.borderColor = “white”; }  There actually isn’t anything terribly wrong with the code itself. It does work when you use it to highlight the border around a text box, but in Netscape 6 and Internet Explorer 5 for the Macintosh, it simply won’t work for images. The reason is, these browsers don’t supply a style object for Image elements. So, you simply can’t set the border color for an image in this way.  With luck, this will be fixed when these browsers become more CSS compliant.  The fix for this is very simple: If the current browser isn’t Internet Explorer v5 or later on Windows, don’t even  S e s s i o n   2 6  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch26.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 324  324  Sunday Morning  attempt either of these operations. So, you just have to add a simple if state- ment, like this:     This method highlights an element by turning its border red function shopCart_doHilightBorder  theID  {  if  isWin   && isIE    {  var theElement = document.getElementById  theID ; theElement.style.borderColor = “red”; }     This method removes the border highlight from an element function shopCart_doDimBorder  theID  {  if  isWin   && isIE    {  var theElement = document.getElementById  theID ; theElement.style.borderColor = “white”; }  }  }  If you are wondering why I didn’t check the browser version, remember that I  checked the this when the user first came to the site. If they didn’t have the appropriate browser version, they would never even see the shopping cart, let alone get this far!  Requiring JavaScript  At this point, you know how to use JavaScript to require a certain brand and ver- sion of browser for your Web site. But, what if JavaScript itself isn’t available? Yes, as ghastly as it seems, there actually are browsers out there that don’t support JavaScript. Worse yet, some JavaScript-capable browsers will let a user turn JavaScript support completely off!  Fortunately, there’s a simple way to handle this situation: the      tags. Simply place a set of these tags in the first page of your Web site and any non-JavaScript-capable browsers that load that page will display whatever is inside the tags.  JavaScript-capable browsers, on the other hand, will ignore these tags and their contents.  For the Baby-Palooza site, I might want to include the following:           4804-2 Ch26.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 325  Session 26—Working with Different Browsers  325  Welcome to Baby-Palooza!     Unfortunately, your browser is not compatible with the Baby-Palooza Web site.  This site requires either Netscape Navigator v6+ or Internet Explorer v5+. You can find these browsers by clicking on one of the following links     Get Internet Explorer     Get Netscape Navigator        Using this code, when a JavaScript-incapable browser, or a browser with JavaScript support turned off, visits my site, the HTML between the    tags will be displayed telling the user that he needs to upgrade his browser.  Hiding JavaScript from Older Browsers  While it’s nice to be able to require that a browser support JavaScript, more often than not, you’ll probably find yourself in the situation where you’ve got a page that’s enhanced by JavaScript, but JavaScript isn’t essential to the operation of the page. In this case, it’s silly to lock a user out of your site simply because the client’s browser doesn’t support JavaScript. However, if such a user does come to your site, your JavaScript code may well show up in the final output of your page unless you hide it from the browser. This is due to the way that most HTML rendering engines handle tags that they don’t support. When an HTML rendering engine encounters a tag it doesn’t support, it discards the tag, but it displays the text inside the tag using the default characteristics  font, size, and so forth  for the page.  So, if an older browser encounters a set of    tags, and it  doesn’t know what they are, it will simply discard the tags, and display the JavaScript inside as if it was regular text, which it is! The solution to this problem is extremely simple: wrap your JavaScript code in a set of HTML comment tags. So, the following block of code:    alert  “Welcome to Baby-Palooza!” ;    S e s s i o n   2 6  P a r t   V — S u n d a y   M o r n i n g   4804-2 Ch26.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 326  Sunday Morning  326  Would become this:    <!-- alert  “Welcome to Baby-Palooza!” ;    -->    When an older HTML rendering engine gets hold of this, it will discard the     tags and then, thanks to the HTML comment markers, ignore all of the JavaScript code inside. A JavaScript-capable browser, however, is smart enough to know about this trick, so it will ignore the HTML comments and just execute the JavaScript.  Requiring a Particular JavaScript Version  Finally, there’s the situation where you need to make sure that the client’s browser is running a particular version of JavaScript. Of course, the latest big-name browsers run the very latest version of the JavaScript language, so they include all of the language features that you’ve seen in this book. Older browsers however, run older versions of JavaScript and those versions are missing such nice things as Arrays  added in JavaScript version 1.1 , Image objects  also added in JavaScript version 1.1 , and the screen object  added in JavaScript version 1.2 .   To require a particular version of JavaScript, you simply specify the version you  need in the language attribute of your   tag. For example:    alert  “Your screen is “ + screen.width + “pixels wide.” ;    By specifying a JavaScript version in this way you are telling the browser, “If JavaScript version 1.2 or later isn’t available in this browser, don’t execute this block of code.”  REVIEW  In this session, you learned about the navigator object and how to use it along with JavaScript to determine which brand and version of a browser is executing your JavaScript program. You also saw how to use that information to write pro- grams that work around features that may be missing from a particular browser.   4804-2 Ch26.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 327  Session 26—Working with Different Browsers  327  You learned how to create an initial page for your site that would check the browser version and, if necessary, present users with a message telling them that they need to upgrade their browsers in order to use your site. You saw how the    tags can be used to weed out browsers that don’t support JavaScript. You also learned how to hide JavaScript code from older browsers by using HTML comment tags. Finally, you learned how the language=  attribute of the   tag can be used to tell the browser that a certain version of JavaScript is required to run the code in a particular script block.

So, in this session I’m going to give  you a close look at several utility classes and objects. Two of these are part of the JavaScript language, and two are a part of the Browser Object Model. While none of these items is essential for creating JavaScript programs, knowing how to use them can make your life a lot easier.  The Date Class  Perhaps the most useful of these utility items is the Date class that is built into JavaScript. As you learned in Session 16, this class allows you to create objects that hold date and time information. The Date class constructor function can create Date objects in lots of different ways. The easiest is the one you saw in Session 16:   4804-2 Ch27.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 334  334  Sunday Afternoon  var rightNow = new Date  ;  When called this way, the Date constructor will read the system clock in the  client’s machine and create a Date object using the time and date settings it finds there. You can also create a Date object like this:  var numMilliseconds = 0; var myDate = new Date  numMilliseconds ;  When you create a Date object this way, the date and time you get represents the number of milliseconds  thousandths of a second  that have passed since 12 a.m., January 1, 1970, Greenwich Mean Time  GMT . However, unless the client is actually in the GMT time zone, the date and time will be adjusted to correspond to the client’s time zone.  For example, I live in the Eastern Time Zone of the United States. This is five hours behind GMT. So, when I execute the above code and display the resulting Date object, I see something like this:  Wed Dec 31 19:00:00 GMT-0500 1969  Which is five hours before midnight, January 1, 1970. This brings up an important point; the millisecond values you use can be positive or negative. Positive values give dates after January 1, 1970 GMT, while negative values give dates before January 1, 1970 GMT. According to the ECMAScript standard, there are exactly 86,400,000 milliseconds in a day.  Leap seconds are not taken into account.  Date objects can represent any date up to 100,000,000 days before or after midnight, January 1, 1970 GMT.  If you don’t know the number of milliseconds that represent your date, you can  simply pass the Date constructor a string that specifies your date, like this:  var myDate = new Date  “May 5, 2000 21:40:00” ;  The format of this date string is simply “Month Day, Year Hours:Minutes:Seconds”. You can omit the “Hours:Minutes:Seconds” portion, but if you do include it, it has to be in 24-hour format.  Finally, you can create a Date object by passing a series of integer numbers that  represent the time you want in the new object. For example, an equivalent of the above would be:  var myDate = new Date  2000, 4, 5, 21, 40, 0 ;  In this case, the parameters are:  var myDate = new Date  year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds ;   4804-2 Ch27.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 335  Session 27—Working with Dates, Numbers, and Web Addresses  335  It’s important to note that, as with just about everything else in JavaScript,  several of these values are zero-relative. So, instead of passing 5 for the month of May, I pass a 4.  January is month 0 and December is month 11. There is no month 12. However, for the day of the month, I pass a 5, because there is no 0 day in a month.   Similarly, hours, minutes, and seconds should be given within the range of 0 to 23 for hours, and 0 to 59 for minutes and seconds.  Because there is no 24th hour in a day and no 60th minute in an hour or 60th second in a minute.   If you don’t want to bother with the hours, minutes, and seconds, you don’t  have to supply them. So, to represent midnight on May 5, 2000 I could have just coded:  var myDate = new Date  2000, 4, 5 ;  Methods of the Date class  There are over three dozen different methods in the Date class, so rather than bore you to death with all of them, I’m just going to go over the ones that you’ll probably find the most useful in your day-to-day programming activities.  You can, of course, find out about all of the Date methods by checking the ECMAScript documentation that’s on your CD-ROM.  Furthermore, since most Date methods come in pairs that get and set some value in a Date object, I’ll discuss these pairs of methods together.  The getDate   and setDate   methods These methods get or set the day of the month in a Date object. Let me say that again. These methods get or set the day of the month in a Date object. Compare this with the getDay   methods  which is discussed next  and you’ll see why I repeated myself here. If you are calling setDate  , you simply pass a value from 1 to 31 that represents the day of the month you want placed in the Date object. When you call the getDate   method, you’ll get back a number between 1 and 31.  var myDate = new Date  “May 5, 2000 21:40:00” ; myDate.setDate  25 ; alert  myDate.getDate   ;  The getDay   method This method gets the day of the week in a Date object. When you call this method, you’ll get back a value between 0  Sunday  and 6  Saturday .  S e s s i o n   2 7  P a r t   V I — S u n d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch27.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 336  336  Sunday Afternoon  var myDate = new Date  “May 5, 2000 21:40:00” ; alert  myDate.getDay   ;  The getFullYear   and setFullYear   methods These methods let you get and set a full four-digit year value  that is, “1999” as opposed to “99”  in a Date object. Note that when you set a Date object’s year to a different value, JavaScript will automatically recalculate the day of the week so that the new Date is actually valid. For example, May 5, 2000 was a Friday. But following the execution of this code the day of the week in the myDate object will be Saturday:  var myDate = new Date  “May 5, 2000 21:40:00” ; myDate.setFullYear  2001 ;  Yes, the Date object does provide methods that let you set a two- digit year value. However, if the Y2K problem taught us anything, it’s that you should always use a four-digit year value to avoid ambiguity. So, please, always use four-digit years!  Believe me, programmers in 2099 will thank you.   Tip  The getHours   and setHours   methods These methods get and set the hour value in a Date object. Remember that hours are expressed as values from 0  midnight  to 23  11 p.m. .  The getMinutes   and setMinutes   methods These methods get and set the minutes value in a Date object. Remember that in JavaScript, minutes are expressed as a value from 0 to 59.  Because there is no 60th minute in an hour.   The getMonth   and setMonth   methods These methods get and set the month value in a Date object. Remember that in JavaScript, months are expressed as a value from 0  January  to 11  December . Note that when you set a Date object’s month to a different value, JavaScript will automatically recalculate the day of the week so that the new Date is actually valid. For example, May 5, 2000 was a Friday. But following the execution of this code:   4804-2 Ch27.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 337  Session 27—Working with Dates, Numbers, and Web Addresses  337  var myDate = new Date  “May 5, 2000 21:40:00” ; myDate.setMonth  9 ;  The day of the week in the myDate object will be Thursday.  The getTime   and setTime   methods As you saw in Session 16  in the discussion of how to create a cookie expiration date , these methods get and set the time as a number of milliseconds since mid- night January 1, 1970. Being able to get a date in this format allows you to easily perform date mathematics. For example, to determine the day my daughter’s first birthday will fall on, I could use the following code:  var bDate = new Date  “May 5, 2000 21:40:00” ; var oneYear = 86400000 * 365; var bDayMS = bDate.getTime  ; bDate.setTime  bDayMS + oneYear ;  The bDate variable will then contain the date: Sat May 5 21:40:00 EDT 2001  The getTimeZoneOffset   method This method returns the time difference, in minutes, between the specified Date object and Greenwich Mean Time.  var myDate = new Date  “May 5, 2000” ; var tzOffset = myDate.getTimezoneOffset  ; document.write  “The date is: “ + myDate + “ ” ; document.write  “The time zone offset is: “ + tzOffset + “ minutes ;  The toGMTString   method As you learned in Session 16  in the discussion of how to create a cookie expira- tion date , this method will return the contents of a Date object with the time shifted to its equivalent in the Greenwich Mean Time zone. For example, the fol- lowing code:  var myDate = new Date  “May 5, 2000 21:40:00” ; alert  myDate.toGMTString   ;  Will produce an alert window showing the following date: Sat, 6 May 2000 01:40:00 UTC  S e s s i o n   2 7  P a r t   V I — S u n d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch27.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 338  338  Sunday Afternoon  The toLocaleString   method This method returns the time from a Date object as a formatted string. The format of this string can vary from browser to browser, but you’ll usually get the day of the week  completely spelled out, that is, “Saturday” instead of “Sat” , the month  also spelled out , the day of the month and the hours, minutes, and seconds. If you need to display your date in a nice, human-readable format, this is usually the friendliest format that any of the Date methods will give you. If this isn’t friendly enough, you can always extract the individual pieces of your date  using the methods discussed above  and build your own date string for display.  The UTC Date methods Almost all of the remaining Date methods deal with UTC  Universal Coordinated Time . That is to say, they report the time as if the client’s computer were located in the Greenwich Mean Time zone. These methods are basically the same as the ones you’ve just seen, with the addition of the characters “UTC” in their names. For example, the getUTCHours   method will retrieve the hours part of a date as if that date were in the Greenwich Mean Time zone. These methods allow you to standardize all of your time calculations in a single, client-independent time zone if you need to.  For examples of these methods in use, see the UTCmethods.htm file in the Session27 folder on your CD-ROM.   Using the Date object on your Web site  One of the more common uses of the Date object is to display the time and or date on a Web site and constantly update it. So, I’ll add a date and time display that updates itself once a second to the menu page of the Baby-Palooza Web site. First, I need someplace to actually display the time and date. Since this is going to be a dynamically changing display, it will be easiest to show the information in a text box. So, I need to define a form and a text box, like this:         Notice that the class of this text box is noEdit. If you’ll remember from Session  25, this is the class I defined that removes the border from a text box and makes sure that the cursor doesn’t change when it passes over the text box. So, this text box will appear to just be another bit of text on the page.    4804-2 Ch27.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 339  Session 27—Working with Dates, Numbers, and Web Addresses  339  Next, I need to define a function that will display and update the time in this  text box.  function showTime   {  var rightNow = new Date  ; var tString = rightNow.toLocaleString  ; document.timeDisplay.theTime.value = tString; setTimeout  ‘showTime  ’, 1000 ; }  This extremely simple function does the trick. It first creates a new Date object that contains the current time  taken from the client’s system clock . It then extracts that time information as a formatted string  via the toLocalString   method  and places it into the text box  I’ve just created. A final call to the setTimeout   method ensures that the showTime   function will be called again one second later, which starts the whole process over and updates the time display.  The Math Object  The Math object is a JavaScript object that holds various and sundry mathematical constants and provides access to common mathematical functions.  Note that this is not a class! So, you can’t create new Math objects. All you can do is use the one Math object that’s built into JavaScript. Fortunately, that’s all you really need.  Some of these will be familiar from your high school and college math courses, while others will be things you’ve probably never heard of. Basically, if you need to write JavaScript programs that perform lots of number crunching, you’ll be glad that the Math object is available. If not, well, you don’t have to use it, but it’s good to know that its there just in case you do need it one day.  Constant properties of the Math object  The Math object contains the following constant properties. These are called con- stants for the simple reason that you can’t change them  so they have a constant value . However, you access them just as you would the properties of any other object.  Note that there are more constant properties defined in the Math object. Be sure to check the ECMAScript documentation on your CD-ROM to find out about the others.   S e s s i o n   2 7  P a r t   V I — S u n d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch27.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 340  340  Sunday Afternoon  The Math.E property This is the constant value 2.718281828459045.  The Math.PI property This is the constant value 3.141592653589793.  that is, π   The Math.SQRT2 property This is the constant value 1.4142135623730951.  that is, √2   Methods of the Math object  There are almost twenty different methods in the Math object, very few of which are useful for day-to-day programming. So, I’ll just go over the most useful ones here. Be sure to check the ECMAScript documentation on your CD-ROM for details on all of the Math object’s methods. Examples of these methods and others can be found in the mathMethods.htm file on your CD-ROM.  The Math.abs   method This method will return the absolute value of the number you pass to it.  The Math.max   and Math.min   methods You pass these methods two or more numbers and they return the largest or small- est of those numbers respectively.  The Math.pow   method You pass this method two numbers. The first number will be raised to the power of the second. For example, the following is the same as 2 * 2 * 2.  var result = Math.pow  2, 3 ;  The Math.random   method This method takes no parameters and returns a pseudorandom number between 0 and 1.   4804-2 Ch27.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 341  Session 27—Working with Dates, Numbers, and Web Addresses  341  The Math.round   method This method rounds the number you pass it to the closest integer value.  The Math.sqrt   method This method returns the square root of the number you pass to it.  The location Object  In Sessions 8 and 9, you learned about the window.location property and the  document.location property respectively. If you were looking closely, you might have noticed that each of these properties seems to represent the same thing: the Web address of the HTML document that is currently loaded into the Web browser. As you’ve seen in subsequent sessions, you can actually force the browser to load a new HTML document simply by assigning a new Web address to one of these properties.  While it might seem that these are just simple String objects, each of these  location properties is actually a complex object in its own right. While you can use it as a simple redirection tool, the properties and methods of the location object can give you a lot of information about the Web address that is currently loaded into the Web browser.   While the window.location and document.location properties hold essen-  tially the same information, the document.location property will probably be left behind in favor of the document.URL property. So, I’m going to restrict my discus- sion to window.location.   Properties of the location object  Any of the following properties can be set to a new value. Doing so will usually cause the browser to load the document specified by the new value. However, this is a browser-specific behavior, so, the best way to guarantee that your new docu- ment will be loaded is to always build your new Web address as a complete string and then assign it to the location.href property.  The hash property This contains a String object containing the “hash” part of the Web address speci- fied in the href property. For example, if the href property contains  http:  www.baby-palooza.com index.htmtop  the hash portion is top.  S e s s i o n   2 7  P a r t   V I — S u n d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch27.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 342  342  Sunday Afternoon  The host property This contains a String object containing the host information from the Web address specified in the href property. For example, if the href property contains  http:  www.baby-palooza.com  the host portion is “www.baby-palooza.com:80”.  The hostname property This contains a String object containing just the host name information from the Web address in the href property. For example, if the href property contains in this link:  http:  www.baby-palooza.com  The hostname portion is “www.baby-palooza.com”.  The href property This contains the complete Web address of the current location. Assigning a new Web address to this property will force the Web browser to load the document at that address.  The pathname property If the Web address in the href property points to a file that’s buried in a folder somewhere on the server, this property will contain the path to that file. For example, if this is the href property:  http:  www.baby-palooza.com strollers index.htm  The pathname property would contain the string “strollers index.htm”.  The port property This is a String object containing the port specified in the href property.  http:  www.baby-palooza.com:80  Here, the port property would contain the value 80.   4804-2 Ch27.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 343  Session 27—Working with Dates, Numbers, and Web Addresses  343  The protocol property This is the protocol  http, ftp, etc.  that was used to load the Web address speci- fied in the href property.  The search property This is the query string specified in the Web address in the href property.  http:  www.baby-palooza.com search.htm?type=stroller  In this example, the search property would contain the string  ?type=stroller. Note that the question mark is included at the start of the string.  Methods of the location object  If you want to load a new page into the web browser, you can just assign a new Web address to the location.href property. However, one of the following meth- ods will give you more control over the process.  The reload   method This method tells the browser to reload the document referenced in the href property. This method can take a Boolean parameter, which is named force. If the force parameter is true, the page will be reloaded from the Web server even if an up-to-date copy exists in the browser’s cache.  The replace   method When you call this method, you pass it the Web address of a new document that you want loaded into the Web browser. This new document will be loaded into the Web browser and its Web address will replace the Web address of the currently loaded document in the browser’s history list.  See the next section for a discussion of the history list.  This can be very handy if you have a series of “invisible” JavaScript pages, each of which triggers the loading of the next until a final page is reached. If each of these interim pages uses the replace   method to load the next page, then only the final page  the one the user actually sees , will end up in the history list. So, when the user clicks the Back button in the browser, all of the interim pages will be skipped over and the user will go directly back to the starting page.  A complete example of this can be found in the locationReplaceMethod.htm file on your CD-ROM.   S e s s i o n   2 7  P a r t   V I — S u n d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch27.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 344  344  Sunday Afternoon  The history Object  The length property  The last object I want to tell you about in this session is the window.history object. As the name suggests, this object holds a list of the Web addresses that the user has visited since she started up her browser.  The history object has only one property: length. This property tells you how many entries are in the history list.  Methods of the history object  Thus far, the history object looks a lot like an Array doesn’t it? Well, it is, but it’s a rather special Array. Because it contains information about the user’s Web surfing habits, it’s been decided that JavaScript programs should not be able to actually read any of the Web addresses in the history list. In other words, a statement like alert  history[0]  will either yield an error or a value of undefined. So, the best you can do is use one of the history object’s methods to move the browser back and forth through the list of pages that have been visited.  The back   method Calling this method will cause the browser to reload the Web address stored in the previous history list entry, if one exists.  It’s just like hitting the browser’s Back button.   The forward   method Calling this method will cause the browser to load the Web address stored in the next history list entry, if one exists.  It’s just like hitting the browser’s Forward button.   The go   method When you call this method, you pass it a positive or a negative integer. The browser will jump that many places in the history list  forward if the number is positive and backward if the number is negative  and load the Web address stored at that point in the history list.   4804-2 Ch27.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 345  Session 27—Working with Dates, Numbers, and Web Addresses  345  The history object, frames, and windows  While the history object might not seem that thrilling at first, one very important aspect of it is that every frame and every window you create has its own history object. So, it’s entirely possible to create a set of controls that live in one frame and allow you to move backwards and forwards through the history of another frame.  Another important thing to know is that, in a frames-based Web site, the top  object also has a history object that is sort of an amalgam of all the history objects that belong to its frames. So, if the user changes the page in one frame, then changes the page in another frame, those individual changes not only go into each frame’s history list, they both go into the top object’s master history list. Moving back and forth through this history list will actually change the contents of the appropriate frames and not the top window.  REVIEW  In this session, you learned about several utility objects and classes that are built into the JavaScript language and the Browser Object Model. You saw how the Date class can be used to create Date objects that hold time and date information. You also learned how to perform simple date mathematics to create new dates. You learned about the Math object and its properties and methods. You learned how the location object can be used to move the browser from one HTML document to another and how the properties of this object can give you information about the document that is currently loaded. Finally, you learned how the history object can be used to move back and forth through the list of pages that have been viewed since the browser was started.  QUIZ YOURSELF  1.

For example, it can’t open a connec- tion with a database. It’s also not very good at creating charts, graphs, or other graphics. On those occasions when you need to do something that JavaScript simply can’t do  or doesn’t do very well , you’ll probably want to turn the task over to some sort of server-side application.  The Common Gateway Interface  If you’ve been using the Web for a while now, you’ve undoubtedly heard of the Common Gateway Interface or CGI. Usually, you’ll hear about the CGI in terms of an application — for example, “I had to write a CGI application to collect data from a Web page form and put it in a database.” The term CGI application is really a bit of a misnomer because it implies that the application is written in some language called CGI. But, the CGI isn’t a programming language; it’s simply a protocol that  ✔  4804-2 Ch28.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 348  348  Sunday Afternoon  client-side programs use to communicate with server-side programs. So, when you hear someone talk about that “CGI application” that they wrote, all they are say- ing is that they wrote a program that uses the CGI protocol to send receive data to from some other process. So, CGI applications can be written in any language that supports the protocol. Perl, C, and Python are all popular languages for creat- ing CGI applications but they are by no means the only languages that you can use to create CGI applications.  Understanding the CGI data format  Entire books can be  and have been  written about the CGI.  For all the technical details on CGI, you should visit the CGI specification page at www.w3.org CGI .  However, the whole thing really boils down to the way that data is formatted so that it can be transmitted between the client and the server. Basically, data that’s formatted for transmission through the CGI looks like this:  name1=value1&name2=value2&name3=value3  As you can see, this is just a series of name and value pairs that are separated  by ampersands. As simple as this appears to be, there are still a couple of rules that you have to follow to properly transmit data through the CGI.  cid:2  Spaces are not allowed. Blank spaces and other white space characters are not allowed anywhere in the data that you want to send through the CGI. If you want to send a blank space you must either replace it with a + or send its equivalent hexadecimal code. To transmit other white space char- acters  like tabs and line feeds  you should send their hexadecimal codes. This of course, leads to the question, “How do I create these hexadecimal codes?” To answer this question, JavaScript provides the escape   func- tion.  Replacing the special characters in a string with their hexadecimal equivalents is usually referred to as escaping the string.  You’ll be learning about this function and its counterpart, the unescape   function, a bit later in this session.   cid:2  Any other special characters, including the ampersand  &  and equal sign  =  should also be transmitted as hexadecimal characters. When you trans- mit data via the CGI, equal signs are always used to associate a value with a name and ampersands are always treated as separators of name=value pairs. So, if one of your values includes an ampersand or an equal sign, it must be sent as a hexadecimal code, so that the receiving program doesn’t misinterpret your data.   4804-2 Ch28.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 349  Session 28—Communicating with Server-Side Processes  349  As an example of this, assume that you have three fields that you want to  transmit through the CGI: firstName, lastName, and address. Further assume that the values of these fields are “John,” “Public,” and “123 Anyplace Rd.” This information could be transmitted through the CGI in either of the following forms:  firstName=John&lastName=Public&address=123+Anyplace+Rd. firstName=John&lastName=Public&address=123%20Anyplace%20Rd.  In the first of these, the spaces in the address have been replaced by plus signs  + . In the second, the spaces have been replaced by their equivalent hexadecimal code  20 . The percent sign  %  is used to tell the CGI application that the next two characters are a hexadecimal character code that should be transformed back into an actual character before processing further.  This might lead you wonder how you can transmit + and % through the CGI without confusion. I’ll be dis- cussing that in just a bit.   The CGI methods  As I said earlier, the CGI is a protocol that a client and server can use to transmit data between each other. The way that this data is formatted is only one part of this protocol. Another part is how the formatted data actually gets to where it’s going. In the CGI protocol, there are two standard methods that are used to trans- mit data. These methods are known as post and get.  Note that the CGI protocol doesn’t use objects, so these aren’t methods in the same sense that toUpperCase   is a method of the String object. They are called methods because they each describe a process for transmitting data. This makes them “methods” in that they describe how to carry out a real-world task, moving data from one place to another, rather than being associated with abstract objects.   The get method The get method is the simpler of the two. When data is transmitted in this way, it is formatted as shown above and then simply tacked onto the end of the Web address of the CGI application that the data is being sent to. So, if I wanted to send my firstName and lastName data to an application on the Baby-Palooza Web site via the get method, I would use a Web address that looks like this:  http:  www.babypalooza.com cgiapp.exe?firstName= John&lastName=Public  Here, cgiapp.exe is the name of the server-side CGI application that I want to invoke. Everything that comes after the question mark is called the query string or  S e s s i o n   2 8  P a r t   V I — S u n d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch28.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 350  350  Sunday Afternoon  the search string.  From here on out, I’ll be referring to this as the “search string,” because that’s the way JavaScript refers to it.  When the Web server looks at this, it will see that cgiapp.exe is an executable program and not an HTML document. So, it will start this program up and pass to it a parameter that contains the search string that was sent as part of the Web address. It’s then up to cgiapp.exe to extract the information it needs from the search string, process it, and return its results to the Web server. The Web server will then take those results  usually a complete HTML document  and send them back to the client.  As you can see, the get method is very simple to use. However, it does have the  drawback that you are limited in how much data you can transmit this way. Web browsers usually have a maximum allowed size for a Web address, so if you want to transmit a lot of data  like the contents of one or more text fields  the get method is not the way to go.  The post method The post method is much better suited for transmitting large amounts of data. While the format of the data is exactly the same, the way it’s sent is different. When data is transmitted via the post method, nothing is added to the end of the Web address. Instead, a special header is sent that tells the Web server how many bytes of data are being transmitted. That actual data is then sent in one big chunk to the Web server. The Web server turns around and passes this same information  the number of bytes and the big chunk of data  to the CGI application. The CGI application can then read the data from a standard input stream  which is similar to the streams you learned about in Session 9  and process it in exactly the same way as if it had gotten the data from the search string.  How CGI Works with HTML and JavaScript  When you create an HTML form, you can use the method= attribute to specify which of the two CGI methods  get or post  that you want the browser to use when it sends the forms data to the Web server. For example, given this form definition:              4804-2 Ch28.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 351  Session 28—Communicating with Server-Side Processes  351  When this form’s Submit button is clicked, its data will be sent to the  cgiapp.exe application via the post method. If the initial   tag had looked like this:     Then the data in this form would be sent via the get method.  Many folks don’t  realize that if you don’t specify a method for a form, it will default to the get method. This can be very bad news if your form data contains sensitive informa- tion like passwords or credit card information. This is because, when the get method is used to submit your form data, the browser will attach that data, including any sensitive information, to the end of the Web address that’s specified in the action= attribute of your form. On the other hand, when you use the post method, the data in your form is hidden from casual observers. So, if it’s the post method you want, be sure to specify it when you define your forms!   Using get and post with HTML  As I mentioned earlier, if you want to send white space or other special characters through the CGI, you need to make sure that those characters have been properly escaped before you send them. If all you are doing is collecting data in a form and then letting the browser send that data when the Submit button is clicked, you don’t have anything to worry about. The browser will automatically arrange your data into a CGI-compliant format and escape all of the data that was in the form before it is sent. In other words, if you let it, the browser will automatically han- dle all of the CGI dirty work for you.  Using the get method with JavaScript  While the browser is perfectly capable of handling simple data submissions, there will probably be times when you need to exercise a bit more control over what gets sent to your server-side process. In those cases, you can actually use JavaScript to build and submit your own CGI-compliant data via the get method.  Building and using a search query string Using JavaScript to create a get method-compliant search string is extremely easy to do and you don’t even need to use a form to do it. For example, assume that I need to create a series of links that, when clicked, will invoke a server-side appli- cation that generates a sales report. When this application is invoked, it expects  S e s s i o n   2 8  P a r t   V I — S u n d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch28.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 352  352  Sunday Afternoon  to receive two parameters: a year and a quarter for which sales should be summa- rized.  Note that all of the code for the following example can be found in the files bpReports.htm and qtrSalesSummary.htm, which are in the Session28 folder on your CD-ROM.  First, I have to define the appropriate links, which might look something like this:   Q1, 2001   Q2, 2001   Q3, 2001   Q4, 2001   In each of these links, I’m calling a JavaScript function named doQtrSummary  .  This function will take the parameters I pass to it  a year and a quarter for my report  and build an appropriate search string that I can use to invoke my server- side process. Here’s what that function looks like:  function doQtrSummary  year, qtr  {  var sStr = “year=” + year; sStr += “&qtr=” + qtr; location.href = “qtrSalesSummary.htm” + “?” + sStr; }  As you can see, there isn’t much to this. First, I take the year value and con-  catenate it with the string year=. This will give me the name=value pair that represents my year parameter. Next, I take this string and concatenate it with the name=value pair that will represent my quarter parameter. Note the ampersand that separates the two name=value pairs. When these first two lines of code finish, I’ll have a string that looks like this  assuming that the first link is the one that’s clicked : year=2001&qtr=1  All that’s left is to append this to the end of the Web address of the server-side CGI application that I want to invoke. This is done in the last line of the function.  Of course, since I don’t know what sort of server setup you have, I can’t really invoke a conventional CGI application in this example. As a substitute, I’m just invoking another HTML file. However, the way I’m invoking this HTML file is exactly the same way you would invoke any other CGI application.  Notice that, between the Web address of my CGI application and the search string, there is a question mark. This question mark is what separates the actual Web address of your CGI application from the search string that you want to send to it. So, when all of this concatenation is finished, my final Web address will look like this: qtrSalesSummary.htm?year=2001&qtr=1   4804-2 Ch28.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 353  Session 28—Communicating with Server-Side Processes  353  Once I have this Web address and search string combination built, all I have to do is assign it to the href property of the location object. As you saw in the last session, this will tell the browser to request this document from the Web server. When the Web server sees this request, it will break off the search string  every- thing from the question mark on  and pass it to the CGI application that I’ve requested. It’s then up to the CGI application to process the search string and pass its results back to the Web server, which in turn will pass them back to the Web browser.  Escaping the values in a search string As you can see, building and sending a get method request to a CGI application is amazingly simple. However, what I’ve just shown you is the simplest case. None of the values in this example had any white space or special characters that needed to be escaped before transmitting them through the CGI. So, to make things a bit more interesting, I’ll change my function to allow the user to add a title to the report.  function doQtrSummary  year, qtr  {  var title = prompt  “Title for report...”, “Sales Summary” ; if  title != null  {  var sStr = “year=” + year; sStr += “&qtr=” + qtr; sStr += “&title=” + escape  title ; location.href = “qtrSalesSummary.htm” + “?” + sStr; }  }  In this version of my function, a prompt window asks the user to specify a title  to use for the report. Since the user can type anything in this prompt window, I need to make sure that any white space or special characters she enters will make it through the CGI properly. So, I take the value that the user typed in and pass it to the escape   function. The escape   function looks at each character in a string and, if a character is a white space or special character, it replaces that character with its hexadecimal code value, preceded by a percent sign  % . So, for example, the following statement:  alert  escape “Hello & Welcome!”  ;  Will open an alert window that displays the following string:  Hello%20%26%20Welcome%21  S e s s i o n   2 8  P a r t   V I — S u n d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch28.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 354  354  Sunday Afternoon  In this case, the escape   function changed each space character into %20, the ampersand character into %26 and the exclamation point into %21. Unlike the char- acters that they represent, these character codes can pass safely through the CGI. It’s very important to understand that you should only escape   individual values in your search string, and not your entire search string! Consider this function:  function doQtrSummary  year, qtr  {  var title = prompt  “Title for report...”, “Sales Summary” ; if  title != null  {  var sStr = “year=” + year; sStr += “&qtr=” + qtr; sStr += “&title=” + title; location.href = “qtrSalesSummary.htm?” + escape sStr ; }  }  Well, in this version of the function, I’m escaping the entire search string and  not just the values that are in it. This would give me a search string that looks something like this:  year%3D2001%26qtr%3D1%26title%3DSales%20Summary  Instead of the correct string, which is this:   year=2001&qtr=1&title=Sales%20Summary  Escaping the + character As I said earlier, when you are building a search string, you must replace any spaces in that string with either a + character or its hexadecimal equivalent  %20 . As I write this, it’s become less and less common to use the + character to replace spaces. So, many CGI applications simply treat them as + characters if there are hexadecimal equivalents also in the search string. However, many older CGI appli- cations still treat plus signs as spaces and substitute accordingly. Unfortunately, you never know how a CGI application will act until you actually try it  or unless you write it yourself . However, you can count on all CGI applications to properly handle hexadecimal equivalents. So, whenever you build a search string, it’s always a good idea to escape any plus signs that might be in your data. This can be problem however, because, as it stands right now, the escape   function does not actually escape plus signs! So, if I execute this statement:  alert  escape  “One + One is Two”   ;   4804-2 Ch28.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 355  Session 28—Communicating with Server-Side Processes  355  What will display is this: One%20+%20One%20is%20Two Passing this to a CGI  application can lead to trouble if that CGI application doesn’t handle plus signs in the way you expect. So, the only real solution is to create a wrapper function for the escape   function that will also escape any plus characters that it finds in a string:  function escapePlus  tStr  {  var escaped = escape  tStr ; var result = “”; for  x=0; x<escaped.length; x++  {  if  escaped.charAt  x  == “+”  {  result += “%2B”; } else {  result += escaped.charAt  x ; }  }  return result; }  The first thing this function does is call the escape   function and pass it the string I want escaped. This will escape all of the appropriate characters, except for plus signs. The function then enters a for loop that looks at each character in the escaped version of the string. If a character is a plus sign, the hexadecimal equiva- lent of a plus sign  %2B  is added to the end of the result string. If the character is not a plus sign, the character is simply copied to the end of the result string. When the loop is finished, the result string is sent back to the caller, giving them a string with all the necessary characters changed into their hexadecimal equivalents.  Retrieving data from a get method request In my example, the target of my get request is another HTML file. Not many people realize that you can actually pass data to another HTML file using a get method request. Then, in the target file, you can use JavaScript to retrieve that data and act upon it.  In this example, the target of my get method request is the file  qtrSalesSummary.htm. When this file loads, the search string that was passed to  it will be available in the search property of the location object. So, in the simplest case, I could retrieve this information and display it like this:  alert  location.search ;  S e s s i o n   2 8  P a r t   V I — S u n d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch28.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 356  356  Sunday Afternoon  What you’ll find in the location.search property will be the raw data that  makes up the get method request that was sent to the HTML page. So, assuming that the user clicked on the first quarter link and left the report title alone, the value in location.search would be:  ?year=2001&qtr=1&title=Sales%20Summary  Looking at this value, you’ll notice that the data is still in its escaped form and  that there is a question mark at the beginning of the data. Unfortunately, the question mark will always be there, so before you can process the data you have to get rid of it.  As you’ll see however, this isn’t too difficult.  Furthermore, since the remaining data is arranged in name=value pairs, processing it is as simple as pro- cessing the cookie data that you worked with in Session 16. In fact, it’s pretty easy to write a function that will extract any given value out of the search string so that you can easily use it in your JavaScript program. The following code shows such a function from the qtrSalesSummary.htm file.  function getParam  paramName  {  var sStr = location.search.substring  1 ; var result = “undefined”; if  sStr != “”  {  var nvPairs = sStr.split  “&” ; for  x=0; x<nvPairs.length; x++  {  if  nvPairs[ x].indexOf  paramName + “=”  != -1  {  var nvItem = nvPairs[ x].split  “=” ; result = unescape  nvItem[ 1] ; break; }  }  }  return result; }  The first thing this function has to do is retrieve the actual search string from  the location.search property. Notice that it uses a call to the substring   method to extract everything except the question mark at the beginning of the search string. If the search string is not empty, the function then uses the split   method to create an array. Each entry in the array holds one name=value pair from the search string. A for loop then moves through this array searching for the parameter name that was passed to the function. When it’s found, that name=value pair is itself split into a new array. The second element of this array   4804-2 Ch28.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 357  Session 28—Communicating with Server-Side Processes  357   the value part of the name=value pair  is then passed to the unescape   function and returned to whomever called the function. I’m sure that you can pretty well guess what the unescape   function does. It simply takes a string and searches it for hexadecimal character codes. When it finds one, it replaces it with its equiva- lent printable character. That’s all there is to it!  Using the post method with JavaScript  While using a get method request from JavaScript is fairly simple, using a post method request can be a bit trickier. First of all, there really isn’t any way that JavaScript can retrieve data from a post method request. This means that if you want to send data from one HTML page to another, you will have to use the get method. So as far as the post method goes, all this leaves is using JavaScript to build a post method request for transmission to a more conventional CGI applica- tion on the Web server.  Actually, you’ve already seen how to do this. You see, when you validate data,  or assign a value to a form control, you are changing the data that will be sent when the user clicks the Submit button for that form or when you call the form’s submit   method. So, everything you learned in Sessions 12, 13, and 15 can be used to prepare your data for transmission by the post method. In fact, these same lessons apply to the get method as well. As I mentioned earlier in this ses- sion, if you submit a form using the get method, the browser will simply build a search string  just like the one you learned to build earlier in this session — it will even escape the values for you  and tack it on to the end of the Web address that you specified in the action= attribute of your   tag.  REVIEW  In this session, you learned about the Common Gateway Interface  CGI  protocol and how JavaScript can work with it to send data to a server-side process or to another HTML file. You learned how data has to be formatted as a search string to be useful to a CGI application. You learned about the characters that aren’t allowed in a search string and how to replace those characters with equivalent hexadecimal codes. You saw how JavaScript can retrieve the contents of a get method request and extract information from it for use in your JavaScript program. Finally, you found out that all the lessons you’ve learned about validating data in a form and working with a form’s controls are really just aspects of creating a valid post or get request that will be sent when a form is submitted.

However, they don’t always do it alone. In fact, when you get right down to it, most Web browsers can only display  text  HTML  and basic types of graphics. If you want to display a different type of file or data, you’ll probably have to use a browser plug-in or helper application to get the job done.  Understanding Plug-ins and Helpers  A browser “plug-in” is simply a program that works inside the Web browser and allows it to display a type of data that it wouldn’t otherwise be able to show. For example, Adobe distributes a free browser plug-in that allows you to view Portable Document Format  PDF  files right in the Web browser without having to start up a separate program.  ✔  4804-2 Ch29.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 360  360  Sunday Afternoon  A helper application on the other hand, is a program that is separate from the browser. If the browser doesn’t know how to handle a particular type of file, and the browser doesn’t have a plug-in available that can handle the data in the file, it will start up an appropriate helper application and tell it to open and display the file.  The nicest thing about plug-ins and helper applications is that, if you structure  your HTML code properly, the browser will automatically load the correct plug-in  or run the correct helper  and display your data automatically. While plug-ins and helpers can dramatically increase the power of a Web browser, there is one tiny catch: they have to be installed on the client in order to use them. This is where JavaScript comes in. You can use JavaScript to determine whether or not a client’s machine has the plug-in or helper application needed to properly view your partic- ular type of data. If it does, you can dynamically generate the HTML needed to load your data and display it. If it doesn’t, you can generate a different batch of HTML that will tell the user that they need a particular plug-in and give them a link to the place where they can go and get it.  This is pretty much exactly the same as the way you handle things when you come across an older or non- JavaScript-capable browser, as discussed in Session 26.  In order to use JavaScript to detect a plug-in or helper application, you have to make use of two special properties of the navigator object: the mimeTypes array and the plugins array.  Note  For some reason Microsoft simply does not support either the mimeTypes or plugins arrays in the current version of Internet Explorer for Windows  This omission is all the more mystifying when you consider that Internet Explorer for the Macintosh does support these arrays!  With luck, this will be fixed in the near future. Until then, what you are about to read applies only to Netscape browsers and Internet Explorer for the Macintosh.  Using the mimeTypes Array  As you learned in Session 26, the navigator object contains all sorts of informa- tion about the browser that the client is using to execute your JavaScript program. In addition to this browser information, it also provides information about the MIME types that are known to the client’s computer.   4804-2 Ch29.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 361  Session 29—Supporting Multimedia  361  What’s a MIME  type  good for?  Basically, MIME types were invented so that e-mail programs can look at a file attached to an e-mail message and determine what type of data is in the file. If the user tries to save an attached file, the e-mail program can use the MIME type information to save the file with the correct file type information.  This is a very important capability to have when sending files from one type of  computer to another. Windows, for example, tracks file type by using a three- character extension at the end of a file’s name. The Macintosh, on the other hand, keeps file type information inside the file itself. So, if you e-mail a text file from a Windows machine to a Macintosh, the e-mail client on the Macintosh will use the MIME type specified for the file to make sure that the file is saved correctly  as a text file  on the Macintosh.  Since MIME types are platform-independent, they quickly became the standard  for specifying file types on the Internet. When a Web browser requests a docu- ment, one of the first bits of information that the Web server sends back to the browser is the document’s MIME type. The browser looks at the MIME type informa- tion and uses it to determine how to handle that document.  The first part of a MIME type is a string that specifies the generic type of data  that is in the file: for example, “text.” This is followed by a forward slash    , which is followed by a string that specifies the specific type of data that is in the file: for example, “html.” So, the complete MIME type for an HTML document would look like this: text html. When the Web browser receives a document with this MIME type, it knows that it’s dealing with an HTML file and reacts accordingly.  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority  IANA  maintains the list of currently defined MIME types. You can visit their site at www.iana.org. Once you get there, look in the “Protocol Numbers and Assignment Services” for the MIME types directory.  IANA refers to these as “Media Types.”   Tip  What’s in the mimeTypes array?  The mimeTypes array contains one mimeType object for each MIME type that is defined on the client’s computer. Each mimeType object has four properties:  cid:2  description: This is a short description of the data that this MIME type  represents.  S e s s i o n   2 9  P a r t   V I — S u n d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch29.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 362  362  Sunday Afternoon   cid:2  enabledPlugin: If there is an installed plug-in that handles this type of data, this property will be a reference to that plug-in.  This is actually a reference to an entry in the plugins array. See the upcoming discussion of the plugins array for more information.  If this property is null, then it’s very likely that no plug-in is available to handle this type of data. However, this property is not always the best way to determine if a plug-in is available for a certain type of data. To make that determination, you need to check the plugins array.   cid:2  suffixes: This is a comma-separated list of the file name suffixes that  may be found on files of this MIME type. For example, the suffixes associ- ated with the text html MIME type are htm and html.   cid:2  type: This is the actual MIME type specification string  that is,  “text html” .  Getting a list of MIME types  Since the navigator.mimeTypes property is just an array, it’s very simple to get a list of the MIME types that are defined on the client’s machine. The following list- ing shows a simple bit of JavaScript and HTML that will generate a nicely format- ted table that displays all of the pertinent information from the mimeTypes array.  This code can be found in the mimeTypes.htm file in the Session29 folder on your CD-ROM.          MIME Type   Plug-in Available   Description   File Suffixes       for  x = 0; x < navigator.mimeTypes.length; x++  {  document.write  “ ” ; document.write  “ ” + navigator.mimeTypes[x].type + “&nbsp; ” ; if  navigator.mimeTypes[x].enabledPlugin != null  {  document.write  “ ” + navigator.mimeTypes[x].enabledPlugin.name + “&nbsp; ” ; }   4804-2 Ch29.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 363  Session 29—Supporting Multimedia  363  else {  document.write  “ Handled by Default Plug-in or Helper Application ” ; }  document.write  “ ” + navigator.mimeTypes[x].description + “&nbsp; ” ; document.write  “ ” + navigator.mimeTypes[x].suffixes + “&nbsp; ” ; document.write  “ ” ; }      The code in this listing should look very familiar. It’s a simple for loop that  examines each entry in the mimeTypes array and displays what it finds in a table. The only real trick here is the check to see if an enabledPlugin is available for a MIME type. If one is, the program displays the name property of the plug-in. If not, it displays a short message telling you that this MIME type will be handled either by the Default Plug-in or a helper application.  The Default Plug-in is just what the name implies. If the browser can’t find a plug-in specifically intended for a given MIME type, the Default Plug-in will try to handle the data. If it can’t, the browser will then search for a helper application to handle the data.    If you load the mimeTypes.htm file and look at the output, you’ll notice that there are some MIME types that look like this: image x-targa. The x- signifies that this MIME type is not yet a standardized MIME type.  Tip  Understanding the plugins Array  Now that you have an understanding of MIME types and how that information is available from JavaScript, I need to tell you about the plugins array. As you saw in the last section, the entries in the plugins array are linked to the mimeTypes array via the enabledPlugin property. Each entry in the plugins array is a  plugin object that describes one plug-in that is installed in the client’s browser. A plugin object has four properties:  cid:2  description: This is a short description that tells you something about  the plug-in. This usually includes the name of the plug-in vendor and what the plug-in is supposed to do.  S e s s i o n   2 9  P a r t   V I — S u n d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch29.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 364  364  Sunday Afternoon   cid:2  filename: This is the name of the actual file that the plug-in was loaded from. Depending on the platform, this property might contain the com- plete path to the file or just the file name.   cid:2  length: This is an integer value that tells you how many different MIME types this plug-in supports.  This is the length of the unnamed array of MIME types that’s discussed below.    cid:2  name: This is the name of the plug-in.  cid:2  unnamed array of MIME types: Finally, each plugin object has an array of mimeType objects.  These have exactly the same structure as the mimeType objects discussed earlier.  Each entry in this array represents one MIME type that the plug-in can display or otherwise supports.  Accessing a plug-in’s array of MIME types  The key to working with a plugin object is the array of mimeType objects that’s associated with the plug-in. If you need to know for sure what types of data a plug-in supports, all you have to do is loop through this array and check the MIME type specified in each entry. If the MIME type you need is listed, you can be sure that the plug-in can handle that type of data.  Actually, accessing this list of MIME types isn’t too difficult. The biggest trick is simply knowing that it’s there. Once you do, you can get at the information inside simply by treating the plugins array as a multidimensional array.  Which, in fact, it is!  The next listing shows you a simple program that will display all of the plug-ins that are installed on the client’s machine, along with the MIME types that each plug-in supports.  This code can also be found in the plugIns.htm file on your CD-ROM.          Plug-in Name  Plug-in File Name   Mime Types Handled  Description       for  x = 0; x < navigator.plugins.length; x++  {  document.write  “ ” ; document.write  “ ” + navigator.plugins[x].name + “&nbsp; ” ; document.write  “ ” + navigator.plugins[x].filename + “&nbsp; ” ;   4804-2 Ch29.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 365  Session 29—Supporting Multimedia  365  if  navigator.plugins[x].length > 0  {  document.write  “ ” ; for  y=0; y < navigator.plugins[x].length; y++  { document.write  navigator.plugins[x][y].type + “ ” ; }  document.write  “ ” ; } else {  document.write  “ No MIME Types ” ; }  document.write  “ ” + navigator.plugins[x].description + “&nbsp; ” ; document.write  “ ” ; }        Once again, there isn’t anything terribly difficult here. This code simply loops through the plugins array and displays the contents of each entry in the array. The only tricky bit is the code that displays the MIME types that a plug-in sup- ports, and even that is fairly simple. The code simply checks the length property of the current plugin object and then loops through each mimeType object that’s in the unnamed array. For each entry in this array, the program outputs the actual MIME type information along with a   tag.   Detecting Plug-Ins and Supported MIME Types  Looking at the structure of the mimeType and plugin objects, you might already have some idea of how to go about checking for the existence of a plug-in. There are actually several different ways to do this, so I’ll go over them one at a time.  Checking for a plug-in by name  The easiest, and least reliable, way to check for a plug-in is to check for it by name. You can do this because JavaScript uses the name property of each plugin object as an index for each entry in the plugins array. For example, to check for the existence of Apple Computer’s QuickTime plug-in, you can simply code an if statement like this one:  S e s s i o n   2 9  P a r t   V I — S u n d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch29.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 366  366  Sunday Afternoon  if  navigator.plugins[ “QuickTime Plug-In”]  {     embed QuickTime movie here } else {     tell the user to go get the plug-in }  The trouble with this is that this plug-in name isn’t consistent across computer  platforms or even from version to version of the plug-in! For example, the name “QuickTime Plug-In” came from version 2.x of the plug-in that is installed on one of my Windows NT computers. Turning to the Macintosh on my desk, I see that the name of the QuickTime plug-in that’s installed there is “QuickTime Plug-in 5.0.”  A slightly better approach is to loop through the plugins array and check for a telltale part of the plug-in’s name. A function that does this is shown below.  Note that this function and several others can be found in the multimedia.js file on your CD-ROM.   function findPluginByPartialName  theName  {  var foundMatchAt = -1; if  navigator.plugins.length > 0  {  for  x=0; x < navigator.plugins.length; x++  {  var plugName =   navigator.plugins[ x].name.toUpperCase  ;  if  plugName.indexOf  theName.toUpperCase    != -1  {  foundMatchAt = x; break; }  }  }  return foundMatchAt; }  If this function finds a match for the partial name that was supplied, it will  return the index number into the plugins array where the plug-in was found. This index number can then be used to examine the MIME types associated with the plug-in. The drawback to this approach is that if two plug-ins have very similar names, it’s entirely possible that this function might detect the wrong plug-in. While you can check the MIME types to make sure you’ve got the right plug-in, this is an extra step that really isn’t necessary.   4804-2 Ch29.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 367  Session 29—Supporting Multimedia  367  Checking for a plug-in by MIME type  By far, the easiest and most reliable way to check for an appropriate plug-in is to simply check each installed plug-in and see if any of them support the MIME type of the data you want to display. As soon as you find a plug-in that supports your data type, you can stop your search and let the browser take care of the rest.  This does mean that you might not end up with exactly the plug-in that you  want. For example, both QuickTime and Netscape’s old LiveAudio plug-in will handle WAV sound files. This means that as long as one of these is installed, you should be able to embed and play a WAV file in the client’s Web browser.  Of course, if you must have a feature that only one plug-in can provide then  you should make sure that the appropriate plug-in is available. But, if that plug-in is not available, you should seriously consider making your data available through an alternate plug-in if one is available. Having said all that, here’s a function will check for a plug-in that supports a specific MIME type.  function findPluginByMIMEtype  theMIMEtype  {  var foundMatchAt = -1; if  navigator.plugins.length > 0  {  var numTypes = 0; for  x=0; x < navigator.plugins.length; x++  {  numTypes = navigator.plugins[x].length; for  y=0; y < navigator.plugins[x].length; y++  {  if  navigator.plugins[x][y].type == theMIMEtype  {  foundMatchAt = x; break; }  if  foundMatchAt != -1  {  }  break; }  }  }  return foundMatchAt; }  S e s s i o n   2 9  P a r t   V I — S u n d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch29.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 368  368  Sunday Afternoon  Detecting a helper application  If you can’t find a plug-in that supports the type of data you want to display, you might want to check and see if a helper application is available. To do this, simply loop through the mimeTypes array and see if the MIME type that describes your data is defined. If it is, the client’s machine should have a helper application for that type of data. The following is a function that will check the mimeTypes array for a specified MIME type.  function findHelperApp  theMIMEtype  {  var foundMatchAt = -1; if  navigator.mimeTypes.length > 0  {  for  x=0; x < navigator.mimeTypes.length; x++  {  if  navigator.mimeTypes[x].type == theMIMEtype  {  foundMatchAt = x; break; }  }  }  return foundMatchAt; }  Using Multimedia Files  Now that you know how to detect plug-ins and helper applications, you need to learn how to use this knowledge to actually present multimedia files to your users. Before you look at the code to do this, let me go over the different situations you have to be wary of.  cid:2  The absolute best-case scenario you can hope for is that the user will have  an appropriate plug-in installed. If so, you can simply generate the JavaScript code or HTML tag  or tags  that will embed the data into your Web page and let the browser take care of the rest.   cid:2  If no plug-in is available, the next best situation is that a helper applica-  tion exists. In this case, you have to trigger the launch of the helper appli- cation somehow. You can do this by providing a link to your data file that the user can click. If you want to skip the step of having the user click on a link, you can automate this by assigning the Web address of your data   4804-2 Ch29.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 369  Session 29—Supporting Multimedia  369  file to the location.href property  as seen in Sessions 27 and 28 . Either of these will force the browser to launch the helper application, which will then load your data file and process it accordingly.   cid:2  Finally, if no plug-in is available, and no helper application is available,  you should either tell the user that they need to obtain the plug-in before they can view your site or provide them with an alternate page to view.  As an example of this, take a look at the openPDF.htm file on your CD-ROM. It shows you the code needed to embed an Adobe Acrobat  PDF  file in a Web page.  The PDF file I’m embedding in this example is the ECMAScript documentation file that’s also on your CD-ROM.  Looking at this code, you’ll notice that, once I’ve determined that it’s safe to load the PDF file  either plugInAvail or helperAvail is true , I simply assign the Web address of the PDF file to the location.href property. The reason for this is because I’ve found that this is simply the best way to invoke the Acrobat PDF viewer plug-in.  This is an important point: every plug-in is different. Sometimes the same   plug-in will behave differently from version to version or from platform to plat- form. So, the moral is that you need to test extensively with the plug-in you want to use. The techniques shown in this session are just intended to get you to the point where you can tell if a plug-in is available. Actually making that plug-in work will depend on the plug-in itself.  If neither the plug-in nor the helper application can be found, the code dis-  plays a simple message telling the user where to go to get the plug-in. It also gives them the chance to click on a link that will try to load the PDF file, just in case the information in the mimeTypes and plugins arrays was wrong.  Finally, the code checks to see if the current browser is Internet Explorer run-  ning on Windows  using a couple of the functions from the browserSnoop.js file in Session 26 . Remember, at the start of this session I made note of the fact that the current versions of Internet Explorer for Windows  version 5.x as I write this  don’t allow you to do anything with either the mimeTypes or plugins arrays. You can’t even find out their lengths! So, if this code is loaded into Internet Explorer v5.x on a Windows machine, it will fail to find either a plug-in or a helper application and simply display the fail-safe text at the end.  However, given the fact that Adobe Acrobat ships with almost every Windows- based computer, it’s pretty safe to assume that, if the browser is Internet Explorer on Windows, that the Acrobat Reader plug-in is available. So, if that is the case, I try again to load the PDF file into the browser. If the plug-in or helper is available, the file will load into the browser and the fail-safe text will disappear. Otherwise, the file simply won’t load and the fail-safe message will remain on screen.  S e s s i o n   2 9  P a r t   V I — S u n d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch29.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 370  370  Sunday Afternoon  PDF files are actually a bit odd in that they can easily be displayed in the  browser simply by assigning their Web address to the location.href property. Usually, once you’ve determined that a plug-in is available, you’ll want to generate an appropriate   tag to insert your data into the Web page.  In the past, other HTML tags    and   in particular  have been used to embed files into a Web page.The   tag will eventually replace these tags, so that’s the tag I’m going to concentrate on here.   The   tag has a whole host of attributes you can use, but its basic for-  mat is this:    HTML to parse if file cannot be embedded    When the browser encounters an   tag, it basically takes the same steps as the code to display a PDF file does. It tries to find a plug-in that supports the specified MIME type. If it finds one, it lets that plug-in display the specified file. However, if the browser can’t find an appropriate plug-in, it won’t try to find a  helper application for the file. Instead, it will simply parse the HTML that is between the opening and closing    tags. This HTML can be just about anything, including more   tags. While this does mean that you can nest   tags to try and embed successively less-impressive types of data in your document, you can’t use this technique to launch a helper application if one exists.  Of course, you might think that you could just include a chunk of JavaScript  inside your    tags that would check for your helper application and launch it if it exists. Unfortunately, it turns out that any JavaScript inside a set of    tags will be executed regardless of whether or not the object could be loaded.   To make matters worse, the   tag doesn’t support an onerror event  handler. So, you can’t write an event handler that will execute if your object does not load  though the   tag does support many other event handlers . All of this together means that you have to get a bit sneaky in order to check for a helper application when using the   tag. The next listing, which tries to display a QuickTime movie, will show you what I mean.    function checkHelper   {  if  findHelperApp  “video quicktime”   {  location.href = “baby.mov”; }  }   4804-2 Ch29.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 371  Session 29—Supporting Multimedia  371    <object data=“baby.mov” type=“video quicktime” width=“100%” height=“100%”>   You don’t seem to have the QuickTime Plug-In. You can go   here  to get it.<br   > Or, you can try viewing the movie in a separate window by clicking  here .    In this example, I’ve defined an   tag that attempts to load and play a QuickTime movie. If the QuickTime plug-in is available, the browser will automati- cally load it and play the movie. If, however, the QuickTime plug-in is not avail- able, the HTML code inside the    tags will be parsed and displayed in the browser window.  For the most part, this HTML code is exactly what you’ve seen before. However, the first line is something new: an   tag. This tag displays a cute little picture of a sad baby  which is appropriate given that the movie couldn’t load . In addi- tion, this   tag has an onload handler. When this sad baby’s picture finishes loading, the function checkHelper   will be called. This function checks for the existence of a helper application for QuickTime movies and, if it finds one, tells the browser to load the movie immediately. Of course, a sad baby picture might not be appropriate for your site, but you can always use an invisible picture  that is, 1 pixel by 1 pixel or a small square that is the same color as your background  to generate the same effect. It’s sneaky, but it works!  REVIEW  In this session, you learned about browser plug-ins and helper applications and how you can use JavaScript to work with them. You learned what MIME types are and how they are used to specify file type information for files transmitted over the Internet. You learned that the navigator.mimeTypes array contains a list of all the different file types that the browser can display, either by itself or with assistance from a helper application. You also learned that the navigator. plugins array contains a list of all the installed browser plug-ins along with infor- mation on which MIME types that a given plug-in can display. You saw how JavaScript could be used to search these arrays to determine if a particular plug-in is installed or if a helper application is available for a particular MIME type.

Unlike most other types of embeddable objects, Java applets are actually miniapplications. This means that they can do all of the things  that a JavaScript program can do, and more! Best of all, depending on which browser the client is using, you can actually control a Java applet using JavaScript.  Note  Everything I’m going to discuss in this chapter should work in every one of the major browsers. As I write this however, the only browsers that support JavaScript to Java communication are Internet Explorer 5.x for the PC and Netscape Navigator 4.x. Internet Explorer for the Macintosh doesn’t support this type of thing at all. And while Netscape 6 is supposed to support this feature, it seems to be missing from the first release. So, look at this final session as a promise of things to come, or something nice you can do for those users with these browsers.  ✔ ✔  4804-2 Ch30.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 374  374  Sunday Afternoon  Adding a Java Applet to Your HTML Document  Most Java development environments will, if you ask them to, automatically generate an HTML document that shows you how to embed your Java applet into an HTML document. However, if you are using Sun’s JDK tools to build your Java applet from scratch, you’ll need to know how to do this yourself.  The   tag  The   tag is currently the easiest way to add a Java applet to an HTML document.  Note that in the future, the   tag will replace the   tag. As of now however, the   tag seems to have real trouble when it comes to handling applets.  While the   tag can be fairly complex, you can almost always get by with just a few simple attributes. Usually, an applet tag will look something like this:  <applet name=“appletName” code=“applet.class” codebase=“folderToLookIn”>     HTML to include if browser does not support applets    As with every other tag I’ve shown you, the name= attribute specifies the name  that JavaScript will use to communicate with the applet. The code= attribute is the name of the Java .class file that will actually be loaded and executed by the browser.  A .class file is the Java equivalent of an .exe file in the Windows environ- ment.  The codebase= attribute tells the browser which folder to look in to find the class file that was specified in the code= attribute.  If the class file is in the same folder as the HTML document the   tag is in, you can omit this attribute.   If you want to pass parameters to your applet, you can specify a series of    tags. Each of these tags will define one parameter that will be passed directly to the applet after it is loaded.  Finally, just in case the client’s browser doesn’t support Java applets, you can also specify a block of HTML that should be displayed. Usually, this will be a sim- ple message telling the user that they need to use a Java-capable browser to view the applet, but it can be just about anything you want.  Oddly, JavaScript code blocks don’t seem to work here. But, as you’ll see shortly, you can use the   tag trick from Session 29 to trigger a JavaScript function if you need to.    4804-2 Ch30.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 375  Session 30—Working with Java Applets  375  Communicating with a Java Applet  Once you have a Java applet embedded in your HTML document, your JavaScript code can actually reference that applet and access its public methods and proper- ties.  “Public” is the Java equivalent of “global” in JavaScript. You can’t access anything in a Java applet unless it was defined as public in the applet.   Basically, the way you do this is just as simple as you might hope it would be.  As you’ll remember from Session 9, there is an array called applets inside the document object. As you might expect, this is simply an array of all the Java applets that are defined in the currently loaded HTML document. This means that you can access your applets either by name or via the applets array. For example, assuming the first applet in my HTML document is named “myApplet” and it has a public method named getInfo  , I could call that method with either of the fol- lowing JavaScript statements.  document.applets[ 0].getInfo  ; document.myApplet.getInfo  ;  That’s really all there is to it!  Tip  You might be thinking that it would be nice if the code in a Java applet could call the JavaScript code in a Web page. Well, yes, it would be! Unfortunately, the only browsers that support this are older versions of Netscape Navigator. Netscape 6 was supposed to support it, but that feature also seems to be broken in the first release.  Working with a banner applet  So, in order to pull all this together, let me show you a complete example. First, I need an applet to work with. When you download the Java Developer’s Kit  JDK  from the Java site at http:  java.sun.com, you’ll find that amongst the stuff you get are about two dozen sample programs. So, I decided to take one of those and create a nifty banner for the Baby-Palooza Web site.  Not to worry, the folks at Sun generously allow you to copy, change, and redistribute the sample programs, just as long as you give them proper credit. Like, for example, this fine note.  The applet I started with is called “Nervous Text.” This applet takes a string and ani- mates it on the screen as if it had just finished drinking about ten pots of coffee.  In other words, the letters jump around a bit.  The basic   tag for this applet looks like this:  S e s s i o n   3 0  P a r t   V I — S u n d a y   A f t e r n o o n   4804-2 Ch30.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 376  376  Sunday Afternoon  <applet name=“banner” code=“NervousText.class”  width=“100%” height=“50”>       The text parameter is simply some string that you want the applet to animate.  While this is nice and simple, this applet doesn’t allow for any sort of changes after the applet is loaded. In other words, once it’s loaded, it only animates the string that you initially pass it.  What I wanted was something a bit more flexible. Specifically, I wanted to be  able to change the text that was displayed along with the background color of the applet and the color of the text in the applet. So, I had to make a few minor changes to the applet to allow for these features. Now, this isn’t a book on Java programming, so I’m not going to go into great detail about these changes.  If you want to see all of the changes, the final source code for the changed applet can be found in the NervousText.java file in the Session30 folder on your CD-ROM.  However, I will go over the change that was needed to reset the text that’s dis- played by the applet.  Using a public Java method  When the Nervous Text applet is first invoked, it reads the text parameter that was passed to it from the HTML file and stores it in a variable named banner. This means that, in order to change the text that’s displayed by the applet, the value of the banner variable has to be changed. So, I added a simple method to do just that:  public void setBanner  String newBanner  {  banner = newBanner; resetBanner  ; }  As you can see, Java’s syntax is remarkably similar to that of JavaScript. The  important thing to notice here, however, is that this method is defined as public. This means that anyone can call it, even the JavaScript interpreter that’s running inside the Web browser. So, assuming that my   tag is defined as shown earlier, I can call this method using a statement like this:  document.banner.setBanner  “Be sure to stock up on baby-wipes!” ;  and the dancing text in my banner will be changed to the string that I passed it.   4804-2 Ch30.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 377  Session 30—Working with Java Applets  377  As I said, I want to be able to change not only the text in my banner, but also the background color and the color of the text. This required the creation of sev- eral more public methods in the Java applet. But, once they were created, they could be accessed in just the same way.   The nervousBaby.htm file  Open the file nervousBaby.htm in both your HTML editor and web browser. Play with the Applet a bit in the web browser and then follow along in your HTML editor as I discuss what’s going on in the paragraphs that follow.  First of all, the   tag now includes two new parameters: bgColor and textColor. These are RGB color values  similar to the ones you learned about in Session 9  that tell the browser what colors to use for the applet’s background and text color, respectively.  Note that these parameters should only include the raw color values, without any hexadecimal notation characters — that’s to say, you can pass FFFFFF but not 0xFFFFFF.   There is also a block of HTML text inside the   tag that will be dis-  played if the browser does not support applets. Notice that I’m using the   tag trick from Session 29 to trigger a JavaScript function if the applet does not load. The function that’s triggered then checks to see if the “application java” MIME type is defined in the client’s browser. If it is, it’s a pretty good bet that the user has simply turned off Java support in her browser. In that case, the function displays a short message telling the user that if she wants to see the applet, she needs to turn Java support back on.  Next, an onload handler attempts to retrieve the applet’s default values and  display them in the form at the bottom of the page. You’ll notice that this handler makes use of another function, checkAppletStatus  , that tells it if the applet is loaded or not. Applets can be very large and complex, so it’s a good idea to make sure that they are loaded before you try to communicate with them. The process here is exactly the same as you saw in Sessions 23 and 24. The main difference is that I’ve added a method  getLoadStatus    to this applet that will actually return a true when the applet is up and running.  See the NervousText.java file for the details on this method.   Once it’s been determined that the applet is ready to go, the onload handler retrieves the banner text, background color, and text color from the applet and places those values in the form for the user to see.  Finally, there’s the form at the bottom of the page. This form contains several controls that allow the user to see the values used by the applet and to change those values. Changing a value is accomplished with a simple onclick handler that calls the appropriate method in the applet.

The onclick handler for this button extracts the text from the text box and passes it to the applet’s setBanner   method.  REVIEW  In this session, you learned that controlling a Java applet with JavaScript is really quite simple. The only real requirement is that the Java methods and properties you want to access must be declared as public in the Java applet. Given that, and the proper Web browser, JavaScript can access any public method or property in any applet that is loaded into the HTML document.  QUIZ YOURSELF  1.

Using the techniques you learned in Session 19, extend the Date class to include two new methods: getDayName   and getMonthName  . The first of these should return the name of the day of the week that’s held in the Date object. The second should return the name of the month that’s held in the Date object.  4. As noted in Session 25, the Math object does not have a method to round  a number to a specified number of digits. Create a new function named roundTo   that will let you round a value to a specified number of digits. This function should take two parameters: a number to round and the number of digits to round to.  Hint: The twoDecimals   function from Session 25 is a good starting point.   5. How many history objects are there in a frames-based Web site? 6. What is the purpose of the location.replace   method? 7. What is the default CGI method that will be used if a   tag does not  specify a method= attribute?  8. How can a JavaScript program in an HTML document extract the data  9.  from a post method request? If one HTML file sends data to another via a get method request, where will a JavaScript program in the target HTML file be able to find this data?   4804-2 PartReview6.F  4 9 01  8:17 AM  Page 380  380  Part VI—Sunday Afternoon Part Review  10. Why must you escape the data that you want to send through the CGI? 11. If you need to transmit a large amount of data from an HTML document to a server-side CGI application, which CGI method should you use?  12. What does the enabledPlugin property of a mimeType object tell you? 13. What does the length property of a plugin object tell you? 14. What does the suffixes property of a mimeType object contain? 15. What is the Default Plug-in? 16. When looking at a MIME type, what do the combined characters   x- signify?  17. What is  roughly  the Java equivalent of a global function or variable? 18. What does the code= attribute of an   tag represent? 19. Assuming that an applet named shoppingCart contains a public method  named printCart   what JavaScript statement would you use to call this method? If this same applet were the fourth applet in your HTML document, how could you call this method via the applets array?  20.   4804-2 AppA.F  4 9 01  8:18 AM  Page 381  APPENDIX  A  Answers to Part Reviews  Friday Evening Review Answers  1. You can place these tags pretty much wherever you want in your HTML  file. By convention, however, they usually end up at the start of an HTML file between the    tags.  2. A function is really just a code block with a name. You can pass it para-  meters to process and it can return a result.  3. There are only two Boolean values: true and false. 4. A code block is either a single line of JavaScript code or any number of  lines of JavaScript code enclosed in curly braces  {} . As far as the JavaScript interpreter is concerned a code block is the logical equivalent of a single line of code. JavaScript variable and function names must start with a dollar sign, underscore, or alphabetic character. After that, they can be any combina- tion of letters, numbers, the underscore, or the dollar sign.  5.  6. Two forward slashes      anywhere on a line will mark the remainder of that line as a comment. For multiple line comments, include your com- ments between  * and * .  7. This is sort of a trick question. JavaScript code is just plain ASCII text, so  you don’t have to store it in any special file format.   4804-2 AppA.F  4 9 01  8:18 AM  Page 382  382  Appendix A  8. This attribute tells the Web browser which scripting language the script is  written in. If you don’t specify a value for the language= attribute, JavaScript is assumed.  9. Simply use the return keyword followed by the value or expression you  want to return.  10. Answers will vary. One possible solution is on your CD-ROM. 11. Answers will vary. One possible solution is on your CD-ROM. 12. This is another trick question. A function can have as few or as many parameters as you want. Don’t forget however, even a function with no parameters must include a set of parentheses when you define the func- tion and when you call the function.  13. This attribute lets you specify the location of an external file containing JavaScript source code. This code will be loaded and made available to the JavaScript in your HTML file.  14. The first expression sets up the initial state of your loop counter variable.  The second expression specifies a test that will be made each time through the loop. If the test evaluates to false, execution of the loop will stop. The third expression is executed at the end of each trip through the loop and modifies your counter variable so that the loop will eventually terminate.  15. Global variables are available to any part of your JavaScript program.  Local variables are only available in the function where they are defined. Be sure to use the var keyword to define local variables.  16. The value in x will be 29. The value in y will be 100. The key to this  question is that there is only one equal sign in the conditional expres- sion of the second statement. Because of this, y will be assigned a  value of 100, the condition will evaluate to true  because 100 is not 0 [remember, if its not 0, it’s the same as a Boolean true]  and so x will be assigned a value of 29. JavaScript variables are loosely typed, so you can assign them any type of data.  17.  18. Answers will vary. One possible solution is on your CD-ROM. 19. Answers will vary.

The empty string is a string that contains no character data and has  a length of zero. However, it is still a string as far as JavaScript is  concerned.  2. The contents of myVar will be a string object that has one character in it: 9. Why? Well, when you concatenate the number 9 with the empty string, the JavaScript interpreter will convert the 9 into a string and then con- catenate that string with the empty string. The resulting string is 9.  3. Answers will vary. One possible solution is on your CD-ROM. 4. Answers will vary. One possible solution is on your CD-ROM. 5. The Browser Object Model is a collection of JavaScript objects that repre- sent the various parts of the Web browser and the HTML document that is loaded into it. The properties and methods of these objects allow your JavaScript program to access and manipulate the Web browser and the HTML document that these objects represent.  6. Answers will vary. One possible solution is on your CD-ROM. 7.  In JavaScript, a multidimensional array is merely an array that contains other arrays. So, you would first create your subarrays, and then assign each one to the elements of the main array. The main array would then be considered multidimensional.  8. Answers will vary. One possible solution is on your CD-ROM. 9. To move through the elements of an array with named slots, use the  for . . . in statement as described in the “Using named array ele- ments” section of Session 6.  10. The document object is a property of the window object. While the  window object represents a browser window or frame, the document object represents the actual HTML document that is loaded into that window or frame.  11. The alert   method is used to display simple messages in a pop-up  window. The user can dismiss an alert window by clicking the supplied OK button.  12. A Link object represents an individual set of <a href=”some Web  address”>  tags. Link objects are kept in the links array property of the document object.   4804-2 AppA.F  4 9 01  8:18 AM  Page 384  384  Appendix A  13. The document.open   method opens the document object so that  you can write new text into it.. You then use document.write   or document.writeln   calls to send text to the document object. When you have finished writing your text, you call document.close   to close the document and tell the browser to display the text you’ve written.  14. Answers will vary. One possible solution is on your CD-ROM. 15. The document.write   method writes only the text you specify. The document.writeln   method follows the text you specify with a new line character.  16. Answers will vary. One possible solution is on your CD-ROM. 17. The onclick event represents a mouse click inside an element.  18. When a window or form element is selected and will receive keystrokes, it  is said to have the focus. An onfocus event is fired as soon as a window or form element becomes the focus. When a window or form control loses the focus, it has become blurred. An onblur event fires whenever a win- dow or form element loses the focus.   19. Answers will vary. One possible solution is on your CD-ROM. 20. When used with an   tag, an onload event tells you that the image  has actually finished loading into the Web browser.  Saturday Afternoon Review Answers  1. Answers will vary. One possible solution is on your CD-ROM. 2. The elements array holds all of the JavaScript objects that correspond to  the controls defined in the form.  3. Calling the reset   method of a form is the same as clicking on that  form’s Reset button. It will fire an onreset event for the form and then reset the values in the form to their defaults.  4. The JavaScript document.forms[2] represents the JavaScript Form object  that corresponds to the third form defined in the HTML document.  Remember, all JavaScript arrays begin numbering with zero, not one.  5. You can check or uncheck a check box by assigning a true or false to  its checked property.   4804-2 AppA.F  4 9 01  8:18 AM  Page 385  Answers to Part Reviews  385  6. Each entry in the options array represents a single menu item in the  7.  select list. If you pluck the value from a password field, you’ll actually get back the raw text of the password. It will not be encrypted or otherwise protected in any way.  8. The Submit and Reset buttons for a form have very specific purposes.  They either submit or reset a form. You can modify their behavior slightly by writing appropriate onsubmit and onreset handlers, but you really can’t change them much. A generic button, on the other hand, can do just about anything you want.  Including submitting or resetting a form!  All you have to do is write an appropriate onclick handler.  9. The src property of an Image object holds the Web address of the graphic  file that is loaded into the Image object.  10. For   tags, the onload event fires when the graphic file specified in  the src property has been successfully loaded by the Web browser.  11. The Web browser will fire an onerror event for an   tag if it cannot  load the graphic file specified by the src property.  12. A JavaScript-based rollover works by taking advantage of two events: onmouseover and onmouseout. When the onmouseover event fires for your   tag, you switch the src property of the image to point to a new graphic that represents the “on” state of the rollover. When the onmouseout event fires, you switch the src property of the image to point back to the original image.  13. The parseInt   function takes a string and converts it into an actual  numeric value.  programming.  14. Validating your data twice is just another example of good defensive  15. People make mistakes. What? You need another reason? 16. Answers will vary, but the basic concept here is that if the data that  comes from your form isn’t valid, everything that is based on that data will be flawed. This can mean unfilled orders, bad demographics, and so on. A little up-front data validation can save you a world of heartache later on.  17. A cookie can hold about 4KB of data. This includes the name, the equal  sign, and the value that follows it.  18.

A class is a group of objects, all of which were created by the same con-  structor function. An instance is an individual object from a class.  2. When used inside a constructor function, the this keyword refers to the  object that is being created by the constructor function.  3. First decide what type of data your custom class will represent. Second,  decide what properties and methods should be included in the class. Finally, write and test the code to implement the class. This includes the constructor function and all of the implementation functions for the methods of the class.  4. You can store any type of JavaScript data in the properties of your objects. 5. A constructor function is still a function, so you can pass as few or as  many parameters as you want.  6. Actually, the parameters for methods cannot be shown inside a construc-  tor function. You should only list a method’s parameters in the imple- mentation function for the method.  7. Answers will vary, but a method is a function that is tied to a class of  objects.  8. A method is a function that belongs to a class of objects. An implementa- tion function is the code that actually carries out the tasks of a method.  9. When used inside a method, the this keyword refers to the object for  which the method was called. For example, in the statement myString.toUpperCase   the value of this inside the toUpperCase   method would be the myString object.  10. This statement is defining a method for the object to be created by the  constructor function. The method name is action and its implementation function is named doAction.  11. You can enhance HTML controls by creating custom JavaScript objects that wrap around standard Browser Object Model objects for those con- trols. These custom objects can contain new properties and methods that extend the capabilities of the HTML controls.   4804-2 AppA.F  4 9 01  8:18 AM  Page 387  Answers to Part Reviews  387  12. Simply store the original object in a property inside the wrapper object. 13. When you change the prototype for an object, every object based on that  prototype gains the new property or method. This even includes objects that already exist.  14. String.prototype.languageDirection = “leftToRight”; 15. The Object class is a class defined inside the JavaScript interpreter. All the other classes that are defined in the JavaScript language  String, Array, and so forth , and all of the classes you define, are based upon it.  16. Statements passed to the eval   function are evaluated and executed  immediately.  17. This statement will generate an error.  There is no documint object.  18. By keeping an object’s JavaScript variable name inside the object, you  can easily create self-referential code from that object. This is invaluable when dynamically creating JavaScript and HTML.  19. The first statement is the one that will succeed. This is because it specifi-  cally names the object and method to be called when the timer expires. The second statement will fail because, when the timer expires, the value of this will be undefined or completely different than it was when the setTimeout   statement was called.  20. Answers will vary. One possible solution is on your CD-ROM.  Sunday Morning Review Answers  1. A style sheet is a list of rules that tells the Web browser how to style the  various elements in your HTML document.  2. The    tag is used to mark a chunk of text. You can then  attach event handlers and or styles to that chunk of text without any of the visual side effects that would come from using a different HTML tag.  3. By using an external style sheet, you can place all of your style defini-  tions in one place. Every HTML page in your Web site can then use these definitions by linking in the external style sheet. Then, if you ever need to change a style that’s used in your Web site, you simply change the external style sheet and all of your HTML pages will automatically reflect the change.   4804-2 AppA.F  4 9 01  8:18 AM  Page 388  388  Appendix A  4. You use the document.getElementById   method to obtain an element object. You pass this method the ID of the element you want to retrieve. 5. The default unit of measurement for all of the style properties is pixels  px . 6. The innerHTML property represents the actual HTML code  tags and text   that is inside an element. If you change an element’s innerHTML prop- erty, the new value will immediately appear in the browser window.  7. This property lets you tell the browser how you want an element posi-  tioned on the page  as opposed to where . A position value of absolute tells the browser that you will be providing the exact coordinates  via the top, bottom, left, and right properties  of where the element should be positioned.  8. The top object represents the actual browser window that is visible on  screen. It will contain references to all of the frames that are loaded into the browser, no matter how deeply they are nested.  9. The parent object represents the frameset document that loaded the  frame.  10. Simply compare the document’s self object with its parent object. If  they are the same, the document was loaded into a window by itself and not into a frameset.  11. The window will have no toolbars at all. Remember, if you specify even  one feature in the featuresList parameter, the features you don’t spec- ify will all be turned off. So, if you only specify a height and width, all of the other window features will be turned off, which means no toolbars will appear in the new window.  12. Simply call the window.close   method for the window you want to  close. If your window is in a variable named myWindow, you would code: myWindow.close  ;  13. Define a dummy form at the end of the HTML document that will be  loaded into your new window. Then, check the length of the forms array in the new window. When the length of this array has become equal to the number of forms in your new window, you know that everything in the HTML document has been loaded and is ready for use. If a window was opened by another window, its opener property will contain a reference to the window that opened it.   14.  15. The parseFloat   function takes a string that contains a floating-point  number and turns it into an actual numeric value.   4804-2 AppA.F  4 9 01  8:18 AM  Page 389  Answers to Part Reviews  389  16. This is a bit of a trick question. As I said in Session 25, as far as  JavaScript is concerned, the floating-point numbers it’s displaying are correct. Indeed, they are correct to the precision that is allowed by the way JavaScript represents floating-point numbers internally. Unfortunately, this isn’t what we humans expect to see, so in order to display these values for human-consumption, they need to be rounded off using a specially written function.  17. Use a set of style rules to set the border style of the text box to none and  the appearance of the cursor  when it’s over the text box  to default. The text box should then appear to be just another area of text in the browser window.  18. The string “MSIE” signifies that the number that follows is the Internet  Explorer version number for this Web browser.  19. You specify the version of JavaScript that is required inside the  language= attribute of the   tag. Like this:    20. Simply enclose your JavaScript code inside a set of HTML comment mark-  ers. Like this:   <!--  document.write “Hello World!” ;    -->    Sunday Afternoon Review Answers  1. var myDate = new Date  2001, 0, 15, 9, 47, 25 ; 2. By calling the location.reload   method and passing it a parameter of true, you can force the Web browser to reload the HTML document that is currently loaded in the Web browser.   3. Answers will vary. One possible solution is on your CD-ROM. 4. Answers will vary. One possible solution is on your CD-ROM.   4804-2 AppA.F  4 9 01  8:18 AM  Page 390  390  Appendix A  5. The answer to this question depends on how many frames there are.  Basically, there will be one history object for each frame, plus one his- tory object for the top object. Each frame’s history object will hold a list of the pages that have been displayed in that frame. The top object’s history object will hold a list of all pages displayed in all frames.  6. The location.replace   method allows you load a new HTML document  and have its Web address replace the Web address of the current docu- ment in the history list. This allows you to remove interim documents from the history list for a window or frame. If a   tag doesn’t specify a method= attribute, the get method will be used by default.  7.  8. This is a trick question. HTML documents don’t receive data from post  method requests.   9. The data sent will be found in the search property of the location object. 10. Certain characters  spaces, ampersands, equal signs, etc.  act as delim-  iters and or stops in the CGI protocol. For these characters to pass safely through the CGI, you must replace these characters with their hexadeci- mal code equivalents.   11. To transmit a large amount of data, you should always use the post method. This method transmits the data as a single large chunk and makes it available to the CGI application as an input stream. The get method on the other hand, transmits the data as a part of the Web address of the CGI application. This makes it subject to any limitations that Web browsers or Web servers might put on the length of a Web address.  12. The enabledPlugin property of a mimeType object tells you if a plug-in that can handle this MIME type is installed. If there is, this property will contain a reference to the appropriate plugin object. If not, this property will be null.  13. The length property of a plugin object tells you how many MIME types the plug-in supports. An unnamed array of mimeType objects that repre- sent these MIME types is a part of every plugin object.   14. The suffix property of a mimeType object holds a comma-separated list of the various file name suffixes that are associated with files of this type.  15. The Default Plug-in is a browser plug-in that attempts to handle any  MIME type that no other plug-in can handle. If the Default Plug-in can’t handle a MIME type, the browser will then attempt to locate and execute a helper application for that MIME type.   4804-2 AppA.F  4 9 01  8:18 AM  Page 391  Answers to Part Reviews  391  16. The characters x- in a MIME type mean that the MIME type is not yet a  17.  standard MIME type.  In Java, things that you want to be globally accessible must be declared as public. This is roughly  very roughly  equivalent to the global concept in JavaScript.  18. The code= attribute of the   tag specifies the Java.class file that  should be loaded by the browser.  19. You could call this method with the following statement:  document.shoppingCart.printCart  ;  20. document.applets[ 3].printCart  ;   4804-2 AppB.F  4 9 01  8:18 AM  Page 393  APPENDIX  B  What’s on the CD-ROM  T his appendix provides you with information on the contents of the CD-ROM  that accompanies this book.

For example, the programs from Session 1 are contained in the Session01 folder and the programs from Session20 are contained in the Session20 folder. You can load these programs directly into your Web browser from the CD-ROM, or you can copy any of the folders to your hard disk and run the pro- grams from there.  Each of the third-party programs  Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer, and  BBEdit  is contained in their own folders. Simply run the provided setup program and follow the instructions that are provided. See Appendix B for further information. The directory named Self-Assessment Test contains the installation program  Setup_st.exe. With the book’s CD-ROM in the drive, open the Self-Assessment Test directory and double-click on the program icon for Setup_st to install the self- assessment software and run the tests. The self-assessment software requires that the CD-ROM remain in the drive while the tests are running.

Although I am fairly proficient with Javascript, I purchased this book because it used an online shopping cart as the basis of the lessons and I wanted the code to jumpstart a project. I did take the time to read the book on a coast-to-coast plane trip, so I got more out of it than just free code.
The author claims that no programming experience is needed to complete the weekend crash course. I disagree with this claim because there is much more to programming, even in a scripting language, than knowing syntax. However, anyone who has even rudimentary programming skills will be able to quickly learn basic Javascript development using this book because the course has been well thought out and leads you through practical exercises that will, indeed, give you the knowledge and skills to write Javascript in a weekend.

Key strengths of this book include:

- succinct and focused lessons that build upon one another to culminate in genuine proficiency if you follow the lessons and work the exercises.

- does not stray beyond the basics or introduce superfluous, nice-to-know material that will sidetrack you

- uses a non-trivial application as the basis of the lessons (writing an online shopping cart will exercise every major Javascript feature)

If you've never written a program you may still get through this book, but it will take diligence and personal commitment. It will also take more than a weekend in my opinion. However, if you have been exposed to programming in any language (but preferably the C programming language), you can become proficient in Javascript in a single weekend if you follow the lesson plan and work the exercises. In view of that this book is a worthwhile investment, especially if you are in a hurry or need to quickly get up to speed in Javascript.
