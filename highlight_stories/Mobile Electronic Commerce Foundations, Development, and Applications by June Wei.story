The  emerging  opportunities  in  the  mobile  electronic  commerce   competitive environment  2. The nature of business organizations as open systems and their rea- sons  for  implementing  and  effectively  utilizing  mobile  electronic  commerce  3. The organizational modifications needed toward an effective imple-  mentation process of mobile electronic commerce  4. The role of performance management toward improving organiza- tional performance in the mobile electronic commerce environment 5. The importance of the customer orientation in the mobile electronic   commerce environment  6. The  operational  and  strategic  outcomes  of  mobile  electronic  com- merce in achieving the customer orientation and an organizational  strategic competitive advantage  Introduction  1.1  In  recent  years,  the  landscape  of  the  competitive  environment  has  been  colored by a host of digital-based technologies, strategies, and competitive  methods, which are aimed at enhancing the customer orientation, opera- tional  efficiency,  and  strategic  competitiveness.  In  this  context,  mobile   electronic commerce  m-commerce  and electronic commerce  e- commerce ,  among others, are becoming very popular as components of the growing  and upcoming digital competitive strategy wave.  As a response to the unmistakable and growing digital competitive  pressures, today’s open system organizations are finding it to be a neces- sity, rather than a mere luxury, to jump on the digital strategic bandwagon.  In this context, many organizations are going digital just to join the crowd.  As such, these organizations do not want to be left behind. In recent years,  organizations operating in e-business cultures, as well as those operating  in more traditional business cultures, have been attempting to enhance  their customer orientation through the adoption of some sort of the digital  approach. Such approach includes the applications of m-commerce and  e-commerce, among other e-technologies aimed at the customer.  While the potential benefits of well-designed digital-based strategic  approaches, such as m-commerce and e-commerce, have not been ques- tioned, achieving such benefits has been a subject of concern among prac- ticing managers and scholars alike. In their rush to join the e-crowd, many  organizations have utilized a me-too approach to the implementation of         Chapter one:    A customer orientation approach to mobile electronic commerce  5  m-commerce and e-commerce. These organizations are lacking the sys- tematic and integrated strategy needed to realize the potential benefits of  digital technologies strategically. In essence, these organizations do not  have a complete, well-integrated digital strategy. In this context, a piece- meal approach, coupled with me-too orientation most likely will result in  ineffective implementation of strategic e-solutions, such as m-commerce  and e-commerce. This leads to investing in attractive technologies with- out  having  well-defined  strategy  to  use  such  technologies  strategically.  This approach to the implementation of digital-based technologies, such  as m-commerce and e-commerce, among others, is bound to fail, as it lacks  the strategic focus needed to support the customer orientation. To avoid  wasting resources and efforts, organizations must approach the process  of implementation and utilization of these technologies strategically and  systematically. This process must be guided by a well-defined, systematic,  and  integrated  strategy.  To  facilitate  such  an  orientation,  organizations  must address the following questions and concerns, prior to going digital:                 1. Why  do  we  want  to  implement  digital-based  strategy,  such  as   m-commerce or e-commerce strategy?  2. What  existing  systems,  processes,  cultural  elements,  and  relations  with  customers  and  suppliers  must  be  reengineered  or  modified,  prior to the implementation phase?  3. What are the important factors, approaches, and methods that must   be considered during the implementation process?  4. How  are  we  going  to  assess  and  manage  the  performance  of  the  implemented  m-commerce  and  e-commerce  strategic  initiatives?  What  measures   outcomes   and  measurement  approaches  should  our performance management system have in place?  5. How  are  we  going  to  gauge,  monitor,  and  continuously  improve  the customer orientation, and other operational and strategic goals  resulting from the utilizations of the implemented strategy?  The conceptual framework in Figure 1.1 will be utilized to guide the mate- rial covered in this chapter. It is to be noted that the material presented in  this chapter is based on the findings of studies, which included e-business  cultures  environments  such  as  the  United  States,  as  well  as  more  tradi- tional business cultures, such as the case of Arabian Gulf States and Iran.  Also included are findings from the Portuguese business culture, which  could be considered somewhat between the e-business cultures and the  traditional business cultures. This chapter attempts to enhance our under- standing  of  the  relevant  issues  pertaining  to  the  theory  and  practice  of  effective implementation of digital strategies.

The introduction of the Internet and asso- ciated web technologies launched an ever changing applications of such  terminologies. While there is a growing jungle of jargon and definitions  related  to  applications  and  technologies,  the  potential  benefits  of  these  digital technologies are far reaching. This is especially true if these tech- nologies are integrated into a well-designed digital strategy.  Mobile  commerce   m-commerce   is  often  considered  a  subset  of  e-commerce, which, in turn, is viewed as a subset of e-business  Jelassi  and Enders 2005; Ngai and Gunasekaran 2007 . Thus, in this perspec- tive m-commerce is an extension of e-commerce, being similar to the  latter,  except  for  the  underlying  technology,  since  transactions  are  conducted  wirelessly  using  a  mobile  device.  Therefore,  m-commerce  should refer to “any transaction with monetary value that is conducted         Chapter one:    A customer orientation approach to mobile electronic commerce  7  via a mobile device”  Clarke 2001, p. 133 . However, some researchers  believe  that  m-commerce  is  much  more  than  merely  an  extension  of  e-commerce   Chong  2013a ,  because  of  the  different  kinds  of  interac- tions with users, usage patterns, and value chains, which make the case  for new business models, which are not available on e-commerce, such  as location marketing.  1.2.2  Growth and potential Despite the different definitions of m-commerce, one fact is for sure: in  recent years, there was a huge increase in the usage of wireless and mobile  networks and devices all around the world. The proliferation of Android  and iOS devices has led to new mobile usage habits, and the ownership  of smartphones has been disseminating and growing over recent years,  especially  in  the  young  consumers  segment.  Moreover,  there  was  an  explosive  increase  of  online  mobile  usage  in  relatively  traditional  busi- ness cultures of Asia and Africa, mostly due to economic reasons, because  mobile access responds to a necessity in more efficient way. In fact, mobile  devices are nowadays the primary Internet access devices for many indi- viduals, especially for young people. In this context, the convergence of  technology trends and the generalization of the broadband Internet access  worldwide are changing the marketing game. This represents a business  opportunity  that  most  companies  should  consider  in  order  to  improve  their competitive position.  Furthermore, the global reach of web technologies enables  cost-efficient  means  of  reaching  out  to  new  markets,  attracting  new  customers,  and  delivering  products  and  services   Chatterjee  et  al.  2002 ;  and  business  conducted over the Internet changed the way organizations interact with  their customers and partners  Jelassi and Enders 2005 . Thus, the Internet  has accelerated value innovations in service dimensions such as speed,  convenience, personalization, and price, thereby changing the customer  value  proposition   Kalakota  and  Robinson  2000 .  The  mobile  custom- ers  have  access  anywhere  and  anytime,  and  they  recognize  differences  between m-commerce and e-commerce. This tends to promote the design  of more usable and user-friendly mobile environment  Mahatanankoon  et al. 2005 .  Moreover,  as  the  digital  technologies  become  more  available,  cus- tomers’  power  tends  to  increase  because  of  lower  switching  costs  and  higher  familiarization  with  the  technology   Porter  2001 ,  and  with  mobile  they  gain  more  flexibility  along  the  time  and  space  dimensions   Balasubramanian et al. 2002 .  In this context, considering the opportunities given by mobility and  the significance of users’ location, in order to determine the drivers for con- sumer adoption and usage of m-commerce, it is important to understand         8  Mobile Electronic Commerce  why and when flexibility is valuable to customers  Mahatanankoon et al.  2005 . However, there could be some differences in how convenience is  perceived  in  mobile  commerce  based  on  gender.  For  example,  the  link  between interface design and ease of use may have a special relevance for  females  Okazaki and Mendez 2013 . Furthermore, it should be noted that  users of m-commerce are usually young users and this should be consid- ered when designing applications and strategies  Chong 2013b .  In turn, for corporations, the use of mobile net could give access to  enormous customer databases and provide the ability to communicate with  individual consumers wherever they might be and whenever they might  choose. As a result, corporate managers could enhance their knowledge  of consumer preferences and improve their value proposition working on  new kinds of products and new ways to market them. For example, retail- ers have the ability to advertise prices that are time and location sensitive. Nevertheless, in spite of the possibility of having instantaneous access  to one-to-one database marketing, companies should provide true value  and utility, and clearly separate digital noise from drawing meaningful  attention,  in  order  to  succeed  in  the  m-commerce  space.  Thus,  beyond  the replication of current e-commerce models to mobile applications, the  development  of  unique  m-commerce  value  propositions  rooted  in  the  dimensions  of  ubiquity,  convenience,  localization,  and  personalization  could enable companies to achieve a competitive advantage  Clarke 2001 . However, in spite of consumers’ growing preference for using apps  instead of mobile web, the majority of applications are never used again  after being downloaded and some of them are not used more than once.  Therefore,  considering the  rising importance of  mobile technologies  on  business  and  society,  it  is  important  to  know  which  m-commerce  user  requirements are needed and to explore consumer perception of mobile  applications, distinguishing and comparing consumer intention to adopt  m-commerce from continual usage intention.  Moreover, although responses to mobile advertising depend on tech- nology-based evaluations  utilitarian considerations  and emotion-based  evaluations  hedonic considerations , it is to be noted that mobile advertis- ing is affected by the characteristics of ad communication and by users’  voluntary choices of mobile technology  Yang et al. 2013 . Furthermore,  previous research corroborated that incentive and prior permission influ- ence  the  responses  to  mobile  advertising,  therefore  impacting  on  cam- paign outcomes  Varnali et al. 2012 .  In the final analysis, m-commerce is changing the competitive busi- ness  landscape  and  must  be  considered  when  formulating  business  strategies. This is especially true, given its potential and the shifting of  consumer and user behavior toward mobile devices utilization, such as  smartphones and tablets, when doing business, emailing, searching for  locations or information, or entertainment, among other activities.        Chapter one:    A customer orientation approach to mobile electronic commerce  9  1.3  Business organizations as open systems In recent times, business organizations moved closer and closer toward  the open system of operations and strategy. In the process, these organiza- tions got closer to their customers and suppliers as well as other entities  within the competitive environment. In the process, these  organizations  have undertaken major e-engineering efforts, which focused on processes,  procedures,  technologies,  and  strategies,  among  other  organizational  aspects.  Today’s  open  system  organizations  are  attempting  to  enhance  their  customer  orientation  through  the  implementation  and  utilization  of digital-based strategies such as m-commerce and e-commerce. In this  context, innovative telecommunication technologies have contributed sig- nificantly  to  breaking  the  barriers  between  the  organizations  and  their  environment.  Despite the ability of the open system organizations to read the com- petitive environment changes, threats, and opportunities, they must be  able to reengineer themselves accordingly. In this context, the open sys- tem organizations must have an organic structure, which is conducive to  innovation and learning. Such organizational characteristics are required  toward the effective adoption of digital-based strategies and applications.  In such organizations, cultures, systems, procedures, and linkages with  customers and suppliers are relatively easier to modify and reengineer in  preparation for new technologies to become an integral component of the  business digital strategies. In the final analysis, this is required to transfer  technology to effective strategy.  1.4  Digital strategy 1.4.1    Reasons behind mobile electronic  commerce implementation  Research has shown that top management typically tends to champion  the initiation of the m-commerce effort. However, other entities such as  customers,  suppliers,  and  departments  within  the  organization  might  also be the initiation agent behind the m-commerce effort. The same enti- ties have also been found to be active in the planning for the m-commerce  implementation initiative.  Specifically,  in  relation  to  reasons  behind  the  implementation  effort,  several reasons, related to the industry, competition, suppliers and custom- ers,  were  mainly  cited  among  the  reasons  behind  the  e-commerce  effort  of the organization. It is to be noted that these reasons tended to be sim- ilar,  regardless  of  the  prevalent  business  culture.  The  motivation  behind  e-commerce implementation was strategic. It was aimed at improving the  customer orientation, which is essential toward achieving and sustaining         10  Mobile Electronic Commerce  the competitive advantage. In addition, the reasons behind implementation  are operational efficiency, suppliers and customers relationships, employee  development, and effective external and internal communication.  1.4.2    Modifications required for mobile electronic  commerce implementation  Organizational  modification  efforts  prior  to  the  implementation  pro- cess tended to emphasize reengineering of the different aspects of the  organization. These reengineering efforts included systems, procedures,  policies,  processes  related  to  internal  operations  and  human  resource  training,  as  well  as  relationships  and  agreements  with  customers  and  suppliers. To facilitate this new orientation, these organizations had to  make technological-related investments. Again, for the most part, these  modifications appeared to be similar, regardless of the business culture  involved.  One  exception  stands  out.  Organizations  operating  in  tradi- tional  business  cultures  tended  to  invest  more  in  employee  training,  upgrading and integrating, and or even replacing existing technologies.  Perhaps this reflects the difference in e-readiness among organizations  operating in different technological and business cultures. On the other  hand,  US  organizations  paid  more  attention  to  the  integration  of  dif- ferent  technologies  and  establishing  stronger  linkages  with  customers  and suppliers. In this context, US organizations were emphasizing more  integrated systems and solutions, while their counterparts in traditional- based  cultures  were  approaching  the  e-commerce  effort  incrementally  and discreetly.  Recent  studies  suggested  that,  although  business  intelligence   BI   and information systems  IS  applications could make m-commerce more  powerful,  there  is  clearly  a  noticeable  gap  between  users’  expectations  with regard to the integration of BI and IS into m-commerce implementa- tion and the actual situation  Xu and Yang 2012 .  1.4.3    Hindering factors of mobile electronic  commerce implementation  The factors that tended to hinder the e-commerce implementation process  appeared to be both technical and nontechnical in nature. In most cases,  these factors were related to the organization itself. They included factors  such as lack of qualified staff, rushing the implementation process, and  the  lack  of  technological  resources.  In  addition,  the  lack  of  cooperation  from suppliers and customers was a major hindering factor of the imple- mentation  effort.  Moreover,  the  lack  of  planning  and  top  management  support both appeared to be important hindering agents of the effective         Chapter one:    A customer orientation approach to mobile electronic commerce  11  e-commerce implementation process. The lack of qualified employees and  technological resources tended to be more vivid as hindering factors in  the case of organizations of traditional business cultures relative to their  US counterparts.  Implementation issues  1.4.4  Once  the  digital  strategy  is  formulated,  it  must  be  implemented.  Some  organizations find a top-down approach as more effective, while others  utilize a bottom-up approach to implementation more effectively. Either  way, cross-functional teams representing the different departments must  be  involved  in  the  actual  implementation.  In  some  cases,  organizations  resort to consultants to manage the implementation process. Project man- agement tools are often utilized to ensure an on-time implementation. In  addition, the organization must decide to determine which change strat- egy to follow as it changes over from the old to the new system. In this  context, some organizations use a cutcover strategy, while others choose  a phased approach strategy. It is to be noted that while top management  support is essential in championing the case for digital strategy, top man- agement  should  not  get  into  the  details  of  specialized  implementation.  That should be left for the experts.  1.4.5  Patterns of utilization of mobile electronic commerce The actual organizational utilization of e-commerce after implementation  was found to be associated with several factors. These factors tended to  stress  the  organizational  use  of  e-commerce  to  strengthen  internal  and  external  communication.  In  addition,  the  use  of  e-commerce  contrib- uted  to  helping  the  organization  reach  new  customers  and  markets.  In  the  process,  it  facilitated  the  management  of  the  purchasing  activities.  The  improvements  in  internal  and  external  communication  appeared  to  be  a  significant  by-product  of  the  e-commerce  implementation.  This  increased organizational connectivity, both internally and externally. The  enhanced connectivity facilitated strategic gains in terms of new markets  and customers. In addition, e-commerce often is used to strengthen stra- tegic alliances with suppliers. Also, applications of e-commerce tended to  improve the customer orientation, through improving customer service  and satisfaction.  The  benefits  or  outcomes  due  to  e-commerce  implementation  appeared to be both strategic and operational in nature. In general, orga- nizations reported improved customer supplier and employee relations  due to the implementation of e-commerce. Overall, it appeared that the  e-commerce philosophy and related technologies tended to present simi- lar opportunities and challenges to organizations operating in e-business         12  Mobile Electronic Commerce  cultures as well as traditional business cultures. Therefore, organizations  operating in traditional business cultures stand to benefit from organized  and systematic benchmarking efforts of their counterparts in e-business  cultures  before  launching  the  e-commerce  business  model.  The  lack  of  the appropriate technologies and qualified human resources in organiza- tions operating in traditional business cultures appear to present serious  challenges. In this context, employee training should help. However, the  lack of the appropriate technological hardware and software represents  a long-term problem. This solution of such problem requires immediate  and long-term investments.  Benchmarking  the  e-commerce  practices  of  developing  countries  might reduce the learning cycle for organizations operating in more tradi- tional business cultures. Such benchmarking effort should eliminate the  waste associated with the piecemeal and the trial and error approaches to  e-commerce implementation and utilization.  Our  findings,  coupled  with  several  recent  studies  published  in  repu- table  journals,  suggested  several  factors  that  could  improve  the  effective- ness of e-commerce strategy. Further qualitative and quantitative research  is necessary to validate and refine the art of the effective implementations  of m-commerce strategy. For example, in the case of Iran, information tech- nology  IT  readiness, or lack of IT, is a very important hindering factor for  Iranian small and medium enterprises  SMEs   Ghobakhloo et al. 2011 . Also,  a systematic approach to technical innovation that simultaneously develops  both the e-commerce business model and IT is lacking. The technological  innovation–related investments could be used as motivating agents toward  more  progress  in  relation  to  e-commerce  utilization   Bagherinejad  2006 .  However, without an implementation framework that includes factors that  influence  customer  online  buying  behaviors   Ghasemaghaei  et  al.  2009 ,  business benefits will be difficult to obtain. This current lack of understand- ing of e-commerce benefits is evident in traditional business cultures, such  as in the case of Iran due to the lack of appropriate education of the custom- ers specifically in rural areas  Jalali et al. 2011 .  The  educational  component  could  have  significant  benefits  when  deploying an improved e-commerce strategy in traditional business cul- tures. The educational approach combined with technology innovations  tends to create intangible value. Huarng and Yu  2011  asserted that such  an  approach  could  promote  collaboration  and  cooperation   throughout  the value chain and persuade more SMEs to pursue e-commerce. Finally,  the e-commerce strategy should stress removing some of the  infrastructure  barriers, which contributes to lackluster implementation of e- commerce  strategies among the SMEs  Sarlak and Hastiani 2008 .  Additional effort is necessary to finalize a framework for improved  e-commerce  deployment.  Such  a  framework  will  promote  systematic         Chapter one:    A customer orientation approach to mobile electronic commerce  13  benchmarking in the road toward effective e-commerce  implementation.  The  frameworks  presented  in  this  chapter  are  a  modest  step  in  that   direction. Others, including Fathian et al.  2008 , Bagherinejad  2006 , and  Amiri and Salarzehi  2010 , attempted to offer their perspectives of such  frameworks. The two conceptual frameworks offered in this chapter are  attractive as they are logical, simple, and practical in nature.  1.5  Performance measurement systems A performance measurement system  PMS  should be designed to man- age  the  multifaceted  aspects  of  the  organizational  performance.  In  this  context, it should be integrated and balanced. Such a system must be able  to measure, track, monitor, and improve specific operational measures and  outcomes.  In  general,  two  types  of  organizational  performance  evalua- tion platforms are needed in order to have an effective and dynamic PMS,  which has a broader organizational perspective on performance, which  include and integrate all the specific nature of key performance areas in  the organization  Gomes et al. 2004, 2007, 2011; Gomes and Yasin 2013 .  Platform A is designed to gauge the organization’s competitive efforts  in response to market tendencies. On the other hand, platform B is more  closely tied to the organizational structure in order to support and main- tain an effective operational culture  Gomes and Yasin 2011 .  The first evaluation, platform A, has a more global, corporate man- agement  orientation.  As  such,  this  platform  focuses  mainly  on  a  few  performance  measures  that  reflect  critical  organizational  performance  dimensions.  The  emphasis  of  this  platform  is  on  the  effective  flow  of  products services to markets. The measures used in this platform must  be directly related to the strategic objectives of the organization. This plat- form  should  incorporate  and  support  both  organizational  effectiveness  measurement and competitive external benchmarking efforts.  The second evaluation, platform B, maintains a measure-specific per- spective.  This  platform  defines  the  relationship  between  specific  mea- sures and the organizational unit responsible for such measure. In this  context, individual performance measures could be used to evaluate the  efficiency, reliability, and quality components of operations pertaining to  a specific unit or function. To accomplish this, diverse measures should  be utilized individually and or in small groups. These measures are criti- cal to detecting and dealing with specific efficiency-related problems. The  key to performance improvement under this measure-specific platform is  the effective training and development of employees in order to promote  responsibility and accountability.  The  performance  measurement  of  the  mobile  electronic  commerce  should be an integral part of the digital strategic effort. As such, it should         14  Mobile Electronic Commerce  be  considered  as  a  subsystem  of  the  corporate  performance  measure- ment system. In this context, it should be integrated, flexible, dynamic,  and  practical.  If  it  is  designed  carefully,  the  operational,  strategic,  and  customer  orientation  aspects  of  the  mobile  electronic  commerce  orga- nizations would be readily managed toward achieving the competitive  advantage.  When analyzing the literature related to online user interaction, fac- tors such as website design, fulfillment reliability, privacy security and  customer service, and merchandising have been suggested to be predic- tive of e-business performance  Szymanski and Hise 2000; Wolfinbarger  and Gilly 2003; Trabold et al. 2006 . In some other markets, convenience  and site design emerged as the most important drivers of e-performance   Evanschitzky et al. 2004 .  In this context, business organizations could be better off by making  their  websites  more  useful  and  enjoyable,  rather  than  spending  money  increasing store familiarity and store style  van der Heijden and Verhagen  2004 . Thus, another important e-business performance dimension is web- site usability  Agarwal and Venkatesh 2002 . This performance dimension  was found to be one of the determinants of overall service quality  Yang  et al. 2005 .  Customer  service  has  been  identified  as  an  important  competitive  e-business factor  Huang et al. 2009 . However, due to the pace of e-market  competition,  order  winning  e-service  features  seemingly  become  order  qualifiers overnight  Trabold et al. 2006 .  Although  several  studies  have  attempted  to  empirically  shed  some  light  on  the  different  aspects  of  performance  measurement  in   e-business, considering the evolution of virtual market in recent years  and  the  lack  of  solid  and  integrated  measurements  of  e-business,   further research is still very much needed. In fact, the development of  theoretical models that satisfy the generic requirements of e-commerce  applications  constitutes  a  research  challenge   Fink  2006 .  The  impor- tance of determining measures and metrics for e-supply chains is also  stressed by literature as another worthy challenge  Sambasivan et al.  2009 . Therefore, considering that, even to assess the success of  e-supply  initiatives, managers should, at least, capture information on user uti- lization  and  transactions  statistics   Sammon  and  Hanley  2007 ,  the  development  of  a  measurement  profile  that  matches  customers’  most  important  requirements  regarding  the  online  experience  could  be  a  good starting point.  According to more recent literature, the following dimensions emerged  as important components of e-commerce performance. These dimensions  included attractiveness and education, completeness and practicality, cus- tomer orientation, customization and responsiveness, uniqueness, adver- tising form, customer service, customer accessibility, customer confidence         Chapter one:    A customer orientation approach to mobile electronic commerce  15  and use, pricing information, customer interest, overall quality, and  service  convenience and innovation  Torres et al. 2013 .  1.6  Conclusion This chapter is based on the studies of different aspects of the mobile elec- tronic commerce strategy. The studies were conducted in the United States,  Portugal, Arab Gulf States, and Iran. The chapter emphasizes the  integrated  and systematic approach to the implementation of mobile electronic com- merce  m-commerce .  The traditional business cultures studies, in general, lacked the train- ing and know-how needed for effective digital strategy. In this context,  benchmarking the modifications, planning, and implementation efforts of  their e-business culture counterparts should prove useful.  The  competitive  environment  of  today’s  open  system  organization  has  been  shaped  by  dynamic,  innovational,  operational,  and  strategic  technologies, such as e-communication technologies. The growth of these  technologies,  coupled  with  an  increasing  demand  from  customers,  is  presenting the open system organizations with some serious threats and  many opportunities.  To  meet  such  threats  and  capitalize  on  promising  opportunities,  today’s  open  system  organizations  are  attempting  to  adopt  e-solutions,  through the deployment of operational and telecommunication technolo- gies in order to become more efficient, effective, and customer oriented.  With  the  growth  of  the  Internet  applications,  digital  initiatives  such  as  m-commerce are shaping the competitive strategic landscape of today’s  organizations. In recent years, it appears that the road to the competitive  strategic advantage is paved with digital options.  This  chapter  explores  the  effectiveness  of  digital  applications  such  as m-commerce from an operational, strategic, and customer orientation  perspective.  In  this  context,  the  digital  strategy  must  be  systematically  integrated  with  a  well-defined  strategic  customer  focus.  In  the  process,  reasons for implementation, required modifications, and implementation  issues  must  be  approached  strategically.  In  this  context,  piecemeal  and  me-too approaches will leave the organization without the needed strate- gic control of its m-commerce strategy. The role of the performance man- agement system is critical in ensuring that the organization is measuring  and continuously improving all of the critical elements of the mobile elec- tronic commerce performance.  In their effort to approach the e-initiatives strategically, managers are  left with many questions and few answers. In the next section, a conceptu- ally based roadmap is offered to facilitate the goal of achieving an effec- tive total digital strategy, which is consistent with the demands faced by  today’s open system organizations.

In this context, the complete strategic planning process  is time consuming and costly. The rapid assessment methodology  RAM   approach has been used in different operational contexts as a quick and  less costly approach to assess the weakness, strengths, and potential gaps  of  organizations  in  different  situations   Yasin  et  al.  1999;  Czuchry  and  Yasin 2000, 2001, 2003 . The RAM could be utilized to assess the strate- gic readiness of organizations to implement a digital strategy effectively.  This  methodology  attempts  to  capture  the  options  of  panel  of  execu- tives and or managers. In this context, the RAM uses a scale between 1  and 5. Each participant answers the question  item  using this scale. For  example,  why  do  we  want  to  adopt  digital  mobile  e-strategy?  Options  might  include  improving  customer  orientation,  improving  operational  efficiency, or improving market share, among other options. This process  uncovers  the  reason  for  implementation,  which  could  be  classified  into  operational, supply-related, customer-related, efficiency, innovation, and  so on. Other questions  items  might include the following: What are the  current weakness and strengths we have? Can we close the gaps? This  process is repeated for the other facets of the effective m-commerce imple- mentation cycle.  The staircase diagram in Figure 1.2 attempts to illustrate the RAM,  in association with the assessment needed for an effective implementa- tion of digital strategy. In this context, it could serve as a starting point,  in an otherwise all out costly strategic planning process. The advocated  process is, somewhat, a step between let us jump into it and do it, and  let us wait until we do a complete and expensive detailed strategic plan.  The  role  of  top  management  support  in  the  RAM  approach  as  well  as  championing the initiation of the mobile electronic commerce strategy is  very critical.  References Agarwal, R. and V.

These  effects  have  fairly spurred a number of valuable studies seeking to study and understand  the phenomenon and its interrelationships with business  e.g., Schierholz  et  al.,  2007;  Lee  and  Park,  2008;  Frempong,  2009;  Gonçalves  and  Ballon,  2011; Ghezzi, 2012, Jaramillo and Harting, 2013 . This chapter undertakes a  review and classification of mobile business  m-business  research to indi- cate the current state and direction of research issues in the field. Reviews  are  needed  to  facilitate  the  advancement  of  knowledge,  theory  develop- ment, close saturated research areas, and uncover new areas for research   Webster and Watson, 2002 . Generally, mobile research is endowed with   21   22  Mobile Electronic Commerce  several  such  reviews   e.g.,  Fouskas  et  al.,  2005;  Scornavacca  et  al.,  2006;  Ngai  and  Gunasekaran,  2007;  Ladd  et  al.,  2010 .  Scornavacca  et  al.   2006   categorized and analyzed 235 journal and conference articles between 2000  and 2004 to suggest future research areas  1  about business and organi- zational applications,  2  about empirical research, and  3  toward theory   development. Similarly, Fouskas et al.  2005  derived a research roadmap  after an in-depth review of m-business dimensions. The roadmap proposes  short-, medium-, and long-term research directions including but not lim- ited to the study of organizational capacity to integrate mobile applications   m- applications  and mobile services  m-services  within work culture and  business  processes, content pricing, and interoperability. In  addition, a more  recent review seems to have narrowed down on a specific m-application  area,  that  is,  mobile  commerce   m-commerce   research  and  applications   Ngai  and  Gunasekaran,  2007 .  In  addition,  there  exists  an  overarching  review of over 800 articles that states that within the broader mobile com- puting research area “the technology itself was initially of  interest, followed  by business applications, user concerns, and finally research related to com- merce applications of the technology”  Ladd et al., 2010 .  Ladd et al.’s review somewhat suggests that despite these  existing  valuable reviews, none of them seems to satisfy the need to understand  the  theoretical  and  conceptual  approaches  to  m-business  research.  Furthermore,  considering  the  very  dynamic  nature  of  the  m-business  area, there is room to contribute with a review of the current state of the  area. The purpose of this chapter is thus to understand the dominant  issues and conceptual approaches to m-business research from 2005 to  2013 to identify gaps and to suggest future research areas. This chap- ter is structured into seven sections. Section 2.1 provides a background  to,  and  the  purpose  of,  this  chapter;  Section  2.2  discusses  m-business  definitions toward proposing a more comprehensive conceptualization;  and  Section  2.3  describes  the  methodology  of  the  review.  Section  2.4  presents the results of the review, based on m-business research themes.  A discussion on the theoretical and conceptual frameworks of the previ- ous research is presented in Section 2.5. Section 2.6 concludes with the  gaps  in  the  issues  and  conceptual  approaches  to  provide  some  future  research directions.  2.2  Framing mobile business research Balasubramanian et al.  2002  observe that the term “m-business” lacks a  formal conceptualization. This void has led to seemingly ad hoc defini- tions of the term in literature. For instance, Fouskas et al.  2005  defined it  as “…communication, information exchange and transactions conducted  over  mobile  or  wireless  networks,”  while  Giaglis   2006   defined  it  as  “…the ways in which mobile communication technologies can be applied         Chapter two:  M-business issues and conceptual approaches  23  to address the requirements of mobile users that need to access a varied  range of applications and services through wireless access devices.” These  definitions, as listed in Table 2.1, conceptualize m-business as either a ser- vice  e.g., Muller-Veerse, 1999; Clarke, 2001 and Barnes, 2002 as cited in  Woolfall, 2006 , technology  e.g., Fouskas et al., 2005; Giaglis, 2006 , or as  a product  e.g., Lehner, 2003 and Zobel, 2001 as cited in Schierholz et al.,  2007 . Woolfall  2006  provides a definition that depicts an interaction of  technology, product, and service by defining m-business as “…the means  by which multiple actors conduct discrete or relational exchanges of eco- nomic  or  social  value  via  a  wireless  network.”  Based  on  the  foregoing   definitions  Fouskas et al., 2005; Giaglis, 2006; Woolfall, 2006; Schierholz  et al., 2007  and aiming to advance and develop m-business theory, we  conceptualize m-business as the application of mobile devices to execute  a firm’s functions internally and in dealing with its external stakehold- ers   i.e.,  partners,  suppliers,  and  customers .  This  definition  attempts  to  combine the definitions of Giaglis  using mobiles to address user require- ments , Woolfall  multiple actors conducting exchange , and Fouskas et al.   information exchange over mobile networks . Here, the users or multiple  actors could be either an individual or a firm; the exchange could be done  among  or  between  individuals  and  firms,  but  nevertheless  enabled  by   Table 2.1  Some Definitions of Mobile Business  Authors’ Construct   Author s  Muller-Veerse  1999 , Clarke  2001 ,  and Barnes  2002  as cited in Woolfall   2006, p. 266  Lehner  2003  and Zobel  2001  as cited  in Schierholz et al.  2007   Fouskas et al.  2005   Giaglis  2006   Woolfall  2006   Definition conceptualization  Any monetary transaction conducted  directly or indirectly via a mobile  telecommunications network The application of mobile technologies  to improve or extend business  processes and open new market  segments Communication, information  exchange, and transactions conducted  over mobile or wireless networks The ways in which mobile  communication technologies can be  applied to address the requirements  of mobile users that need to access a  varied range of applications and  services through wireless access  devices The means by which multiple actors  conduct discrete or relational exchanges  of economic or social value via a  wireless network        24  Mobile Electronic Commerce  mobile or wireless technologies  e.g., mobile phones and tablet  computers .  This  definition  not  only  captures  customer  issues,  but  firm-level  issues  too, creating a broader basis for m-business discussions.  2.3  Methodology for the review Only peer-reviewed journal articles are included in this review because  they  contain  the  core  arguments  raised  in  working  papers  and  con- ference  proceedings   Webster  and  Watson,  2002 .  Articles  used  were  downloaded from Emerald FullText, JSTOR, Science Direct, and Wiley  Online Library. The search descriptors used in all four databases were  mobile,    mobile  business,    and  m-business.  The  results  from  each  data- base  were  sorted  according  to  relevance.  The  final  papers  included  in  the review were those published between 2005 and 2013 inclusive and  related to m-business subcategories found in Ladd et al.  2010 . Also, the  coauthors  adopted the following method to  write  the  review;  the  first  author searched for, identified, and downloaded all the papers used in  this review. Based on the m-business themes discussed in Section 2.4,  these papers were placed in, respectively, labeled folders. The first author  read and discussed the issues, evidence, and conceptual approaches for  the mobile business applications services and economics, strategy, and  business models themes, while the second author did the same for the  consumer acceptance adoption theme. We then merged the descriptions  and discussions of conceptual approaches in extant m-business research  into a comprehensive piece. We discussed and recorded possible future  research directions based on previous researchers’ calls for studies and  the identification of arguably less-researched m-business themes from  the issues presented in the evidence.  Furthermore,  the  authors  presented  the  initial  resultant  write-up  at  the  Association  of  Information  Systems-affiliated  12th  International  Conference on Mobile Business held in June 2013  see Budu and Boateng,  2013 . The comments and suggestions from conference track chairs and  participants served as useful input in enhancing the preparation of the  final write-up for this chapter.  2.4  Mobile business research: Issues and evidence The broad nature of research on mobile technology has culminated in the  identification of several themes posited in existing reviews as shown in  Table 2.2.  Examining the coverage of the four reviews listed in Table 2.2 sug- gests that the review of Ladd et al.  2010  captures all the themes posited  in the previous reviews. Hence, we adopt R4, that is, Ladd et al.  2010  as  the basis for categorizing the papers discussed in the ensuing sections.         Chapter two:  M-business issues and conceptual approaches  25  Table 2.2  Themes from Previous Mobile-Related Reviews    Authors’ Construct   Review no.  R1  References Fouskas et al.  2005   Scornavacca et al.  2006   Ngai and Gunasekaran  2007   R2  R3  R4  Ladd et al.  2010   Themes categories from review Technology, value, service,  enablers Consumer, business, technology,  general, industry Cases and applications, wireless  network infrastructure, mobile  middleware, wireless user  infrastructure, mobile  commerce theory and research Mobile theory and research,  mobile user, mobile business,  mobile cases and applications,  mobile technology  The discussions border on the dominant issues in previous m-business  research. Owing to length constraints, we focused on the mobile business  category that explores the mobile computing phenomenon from the busi- ness or industry perspective. This category has seven subcategories includ- ing  1  mobile business applications services,  2  economics, strategy, and  business models,  3  consumer acceptance adoption,  4  macroeconomic  cycles,   5   government–industry  interaction,   6   interorganizational  net- works,  and   7   infrastructure.  Specifically,  this  chapter  focuses  only  on  subcategories  1 ,  2 , and  3 . The rest are not included because  1  there  is limited discussion on those topics and  2  the authors wanted to attain  some  fidelity  in  the  discussion  by  examining  the  chosen  subcategories   Ladd et al., 2010 .  2.4.1  Mobile business applications services The  mobile  business  applications services  subcategory  is  related  to  the specific m-applications that firms adopt and use in their processes.  Research under this subcategory has focused on firm-level adoption of  m-business applications from two perspectives: mandatory adoption— where firms are required by some business association or government  regulation  to  use  a  mobile  technology   see  Lee  and  Park,  2008   and  issues surrounding voluntary adoption  see Liang et al., 2007; Balocco  et al., 2009 . Either form of adoption is expected to yield some benefits.  The  benefits  include  reduction  in  transportation  cost,  flexibility,  orga- nizational  efficiency,  individual  productivity  and  effectiveness,  trans- parency within business processes  Schierholz et al., 2007 , removal of  overlapping  functions,  reduced  document  handling  at  the  back-office,         26  Mobile Electronic Commerce  reduction  in  typing  errors  and  amount  of  clerical  work  needed,  and   single document flow  Rossi et al., 2007 . Despite these benefits, there are  some  challenges  observed  with  the  use  of  mobile  technologies.  These  challenges include but not limited to high subscription cost, customer  insistence  on  face-to-face  transactions,  and  the  cost  of  on-net  and  off- net calls  Chiware and Dick, 2008; Frempong, 2009 . To meet these chal- lenges,  a  framework  has  been  proposed  to  serve  as  guidelines  for  the  implementation of mobile initiatives by firms  see Sinisalo et al., 2007 .  The  dominant  applications  discussed  include  mobile  library  services   Cummings  et  al.,  2010;  Canuel  and  Crichton,  2011;  Johnstone,  2011;  Ballard and Blaine, 2013; Lo et al., 2013 , mobile customer relationship  management  Schierholz et al., 2007 , and mobile supply chain systems   Pan et al., 2013 . One trend worth noting about mobile business applica- tions is the increasing possibility of using m-applications as a service,  hence  Mobile  Apps  as  a  Service   MAaas    Jaramillo  and  Harting,  2013 .  Therefore, business may no longer need to be developing or acquiring  their m-application servers; they can outsource development and or use  already built m-application platforms.  2.4.2  Economics, strategy, and business models This subcategory is related to the production and distribution of mobile- related  products  and  services  as  well  as  firms’  strategy  and  business  models. There seems to be a fair distribution of research along all three  dimensions  of  this  subcategory.  Some  studies  provide  frameworks  to  obtain predictions for costs and benefits of a mobile solution  Gruhn et al.,  2007 ,  while  others  dispute  the  economic  impact  of  mobiles   Rohman,  2012 . On the other hand, numerous studies show evidence of economic,  social,  and  developmental  impacts  of  mobiles   Cassidy,  2006;  Gani  and  Clemes, 2006; Horst, 2006; Ishii, 2006; Mutula, 2008; Dunn, 2009; Best et al.,  2010;  Ndung’u  and  Waema,  2011;  Hamade,  2012;  Ilahiane  and  Sherry,  2012 . Au contraire, some of the negative outcomes of mobile technology  which research have discovered include phone use by criminals, infringe- ment of privacy rights, and the creation of a dishonest society, which have  the potential to affect the economics of adopting mobiles  Cassidy, 2006;  Ndung’u and Waema, 2011 .  Furthermore,  some  studies  focus  on  the  strategic  implications  of  adopting  mobiles,  for  example,  to  improve  work  processes,  increase  internal  communication  and  knowledge  sharing,  and  enhance  sales  and marketing effectiveness  Sheng et al., 2005 . Other studies provide  guidelines  for  firms  within  the  m-business  ecosystem  to  overcome  competition,  for  instance,  by  cooperating  with  network  providers,  releasing new products quickly  Chang et al., 2009 , and having mar- ket orientation and customer focus  Kristensson et al., 2008; Bose and         Chapter two:  M-business issues and conceptual approaches  27  Chen, 2010; Isoherranen and Kess, 2011; Rahman and Azhar, 2011; Jeng  and Bailey, 2012; Kuriyan et al., 2012 . Some studies also capture how  firms interpret and react to changes in the technological landscape, for  example, impact of wireless local area network  W-LAN  on the activi- ties  of  mobile  network  operators   MNOs    Madjdi  and  Husig,  2011 .  The  issues  to  be  addressed  in  designing  new  strategy  in  the  mobile  landscape are also delineated by Peppard and Rylander  2006 .  Due to the potential for customers to affect firm strategy, some stud- ies are dedicated to studying how firms can respond to customer needs   Aydin et al., 2005; Jayawardhena et al., 2009; Yeh and Li, 2009; Santouridis  and  Trivellas,  2010;  Aleke  et  al.,  2011;  Srinuan  et  al.,  2011;  Zhou,  2011;  Awwad,  2012;  Hung  et  al.,  2012;  Tobbin,  2012;  Wang  and  Lin,  2012 .  Concerning business models, issues discussed include the creation of cus- tomer value for m-services  Methlie and Pederson, 2007 ; viability, recon- figuration, and sustainability of business models  de Reuver and Haaker,  2009; Ghezzi, 2012; Johansson et al., 2012 ; search for additional revenue  sources  Gonçalves and Ballon, 2011 ; and how to capture low-income cus- tomers  Anderson and Kupp, 2008 .  2.4.3  Consumer acceptance adoption The  importance  of  consumers  reflects  in  arguments  supporting  the  inclusion  of  clients  in  the  delivery  of  m-services   see  Martin  et  al.,  2012 .  This  argument  could  thus  explain  the  dominance  of  consumer  research  in  m-business.  Research  in  this  subcategory  primarily  con- cerns  factors  influencing  consumers’  adoption  of  mobile  devices  and  m-services   e.g.,  Shim  et  al.,  2006;  Laukkanen,  2007;  Laukkanen  et  al.,  2007;  Bouwman  et  al.,  2008;  Kumar  and  Lim,  2008;  Mannukka,  2008;  Salmi and Sharafutdinova, 2008; Yang and Jolly, 2008; Deng et al., 2010;  Karim et al., 2010; Petruzzellis, 2010; Riquelme and Rios, 2010; Wessels  and  Drennan,  2010;  Gomez-Barroso  et  al.,  2012;  Mokhlis  and  Yaakop,  2012; Tobbin, 2012; Hsiao, 2013; Parreño et al., 2013 . While others pro- vide customer categorization schemes in terms of what influences their  mobile adoption behavior  Kimiloglu et al., 2010 , others study the fac- tors  that  inhibit  customers’  adoption   Dunn,  2009;  Lu  and  Su,  2009;  Koenig-Lewis et al., 2010; Püschel et al., 2010; Dey et al., 2011 . From the  perspective of the actual consumers, others study the actual consumer  use of mobiles  Donner, 2008; de Angoitia and Ramirez, 2009; Sey, 2009;  Dey et al., 2013 , switching behavior  Shin and Kim, 2007; Lee et al., 2011;  Srinuan et al., 2011; Nikbin et al., 2012 , and satisfaction  Chakraborty  and Sengupta, 2013 .  As  noted  earlier  about  previous  mobiles-related  reviews,  there  is  still a void in terms of knowing the dominant conceptual approaches to  m-business  research.  Knowing  this  could  contribute  to  future  research         28  Mobile Electronic Commerce  extending existing knowledge by proposing relatively underused concep- tual approaches and some possible applications. The next section achieves  this aim.  2.5    Mobile business research: Conceptual  approaches  This  section  discusses  theoretical-  and  framework-based  approaches  to  m-business  research  to  suggest  conceptual  gaps  for  future  research.  M-business  research  guided  by  theoretically  based  approaches  tends  to  be  dominated  by  consumer  acceptance adoption  theme.  The  theories  employed  include  the  technology  acceptance  model   TAM   in  either  its  original form  Amin, 2008; Yang and Jolly, 2008; Zhou, 2011; Tobbin, 2012   or  extended  form  by  adding  on  certain  constructs   Okazaki  et  al.,  2008;  Wessels and Drennan, 2010; Akturan and Tezcan, 2012; Lule et al., 2012 .  TAM is sometimes combined with the theory of reasoned action  e.g., Lee  et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2009; Lu and Su, 2009; Koenig-Lewis et al., 2010; Liu  and Li, 2010; Riquelme and Rios, 2010  and the task technology fit model   Pagani, 2006  to form a theoretical basis. On the other hand, some studies  simply  modify  original  theories  to  explore  their  research  objectives.  For  instance, TAM whose arguments are based on volition, seems deficient  for  use in the measure of mandatory technology adoption. Hence, TAM has  been modified to create the technology satisfaction model  Lee and Park,  2008 . Other evident clear-cut theories used include unified theory of accep- tance  and  use  of  technology   Yang,  2010 ,  game  theory   Woolfall,  2006 ,  theory of disruptive competition and innovation  Gillwald and Mureithi,  2011 , economic theory  Au and Kauffman, 2008 , the expectation confirma- tion model  Hung et al., 2012 , and media richness theory  Lee et al., 2007 . The seeming limitations in technology adoption models also reflect in  their inability to explain continuous use and effective use of technology,  hence the addition of macroenvironmental factors and individual skills,  knowledge, and experience to study mobile technology appropriation in  various socio-economic contexts  Dey et al., 2013 .  Studies  with  framework-based  approaches  include  the  following:  providing  directions  for  an  organization  to  choose  a  suitable  mobile  solution   Gruhn  et  al.,  2007 ,  analyzing  the  business  side  of  mobile  wireless  technologies   Kang  et  al.,  2011 ,  developing  viable  business  models   de  Reuver  and  Haaker,  2009 ,  and  ensuring  collaboration  among m-business ecosystem players  Jing and Xiong-Jian, 2011 .

It  is,  however,  encouraging  that some research exists in the business side too. This review’s contribu- tions lie in the attempt to provide a holistic definition of m-business and to  highlight the dominant themes and conceptual approaches to m-business  research from 2005 to 2013. The evidence presented in this review implies  that first, apart from gaps potentially overlooked in the infrastructure, mac- roeconomic  cycles,  government–industry  interaction,  and  interorganizational  networks subcategories, there is a need for ongoing research into the eco- nomics, strategy, and business models subcategory because of high dynamics  in the mobile industry  Ladd et al., 2010 . Second, there is room to contrib- ute to the general mobile theory and research category by adopting and or  adapting more theoretically grounded approaches in m-business research  to fill the paucity especially in the subcategories discussed under Sections  2.4.1  and  2.4.2.  In  addition,  the  following  sections  discuss  the  evidence  and suggest further research areas.  2.6.1  Discussion of issues and evidence First, concerning mobile business applications services, firms face numer- ous  uncertainties  and  challenges  in  the  adoption  of  mobile  technology  for business activities. Studying possible means of overcoming such chal- lenges would be both helpful to firms and as a way of m-business trans- formation  Tsai and Gururajan, 2007 . Detailed case studies documenting  how firms overcome such challenges would provide useful insight and a  roadmap for others seeking to implement mobile technologies. Another  area that could be studied is the impact of mobile technology on a firm’s  managerial functions. Overall, these pointers and discussions in previous         32  Mobile Electronic Commerce  reviews suggest that the ongoing and future research still focus on the  adoption  of  mobile  applications  by  firms  that  are  noncore  members  of  the m-business ecosystem  see Liang et al., 2007; Chiware and Dick, 2008;  Lee and Park, 2008; Balocco et al., 2009; Frempong, 2009 . Such studies nat- urally study the related impact of mobiles adoption. Meanwhile, Heeks   2006  suggests four stages within the Informatics Life cycle: development,  adoption,  use,  and  impact.  With  current  research  seemingly  focused  on adoption, use, and impact, there is room for research into the develop- ment phase—how m-business applications are created. In addition, cur- rent trends in mobile technology usage suggest that firms are encouraging  employees to bring mobile devices to the workplace  Miller et al., 2012 .  With  such  trends  come  benefits  that  have  just  been  mentioned,  but  not  studied  and  tested  empirically.  The  need  to  study  such  issues  arises  because of the concerns raised about the potential for the use of mobile  technology,  for  instance,  to  access  social  media  and  affect  an  organiza- tion’s security  He, 2013 . Since mobile technology has and continues to  create mobile versions of existing hitherto personal computer-based appli- cations, there is a need to study the issues arising from such mobilizations. Second, in economics, strategy, and business models, previous studies  focus on economic and noneconomic impact of adoption, strategic impli- cations  of  mobile  adoption,  overcoming  competition,  how  to  respond  to technological changes, and responding to customer needs. However,  within mobile business organizations  MBOs , there is the need to under- stand  their  ability  to  combine  internal  and  external  resources  to  cre- ate  new  resource  combinations   Koruna,  2004 .  The  seeming  paucity  of  empirical studies about how firms combine resources is evidenced in an  m-business special issue by The Journal of Policy, Regulation and Strategy for  Telecommunications  Ballon, 2007a . There is the need to go beyond the cur- rent frontier to study managerial processes within MBOs, especially due  to the many unresolved business challenges pertaining to the deployment  and management of value-added services  Giaglis, 2006 .  Third,  research  under  the  consumer  acceptance adoption  subcat- egory  needs  extension  in  the  face  of  advocacy  for  the  inclusion  of  cus- tomers in the delivery of m-services  Martin et al., 2012 . Further research  could thus explore how MBOs harness customer perceptions as part of  their value creation process. Also, to attract low-income consumers, com- panies have been advised to reconfigure their value chain according to a  strategic pattern depending on their business model type  Ghezzi, 2012 .  This raises the need for empirical research into how such reconfiguration  is done and what best practices could be followed. Such a study would  help provide knowledge as to the existence or otherwise of any company  that has succeeded or failed in a reconfiguration effort.  Generally,  it  seems  that  firm-level  m-business  research  is  domi- nated by studies on MNOs  see Ballon, 2007b; Anderson and Kupp, 2008;         Chapter two:  M-business issues and conceptual approaches  33  Chang et al., 2009; Gonçalves and Ballon, 2011; Srinuan et al., 2011 . To pro- vide a holistic insight into m-business, other firms within the ecosystem  need to be studied. This need is supported by the observation of focus  shifting  to  value  addition  and  content  creation  and  hence  from  mobile  network  providers  to  other  players  in  the  mobile  ecosystem   Peppard  and  Rylander,  2006 .  Furthermore,  since  the  usage  of  third-party  appli- cations  has  a  bright  future   Methlie  and  Pederson,  2007;  Verkasalo  and  Hämmäinen, 2007 , firms like content providers are also important mem- bers of the mobile ecosystem that need to be studied. Other such firms  include service providers, service creators, mobile operators, and handset  manufacturers  Smura et al., 2009 . Value creation in MBOs would be a  promising area for research especially into the effects of business model  choices on performance, and into the actual process of creating value.  2.6.2  Discussion of conceptual approaches The focus of the issues as discussed in Section 2.4 mirrors a  concentration  of  conceptual  approaches  to  studying  consumer  applications  and  user  perceptions toward them. The availability and the applicability of mobile  technology in many areas of human endeavor result in various applica- tions some of which are yet to be researched. Nevertheless, a good starting  point in keeping track of such applications, and extending existing research  into such individual m-applications, could be the creation of a framework  that provides a holistic classification of m-business applications services. Currently, one important and ever-growing application of mobiles for  business  activities  is  m-commerce.  Due  to  the  different  nature  of  firms  and  their  activities,  there  is  a  possibility  of  implementing  m-commerce  at different rates or for varying purposes across firms. To provide knowl- edge of firms succeeding in m-commerce implementation, research could  study the use of mobiles in commercial activities. Yet, because of different  levels of firm-level factors  such as resources, capabilities, and readiness   and other external factors, this m-application does not guarantee the same  level of benefits for all firms, and even similar firm types. For instance, the  existence of different levels of e-commerce capabilities makes us argue for  the possible existence of different levels of achieving m-commerce and the  broader form of m-business  Boateng et al., 2008 . Future research could  adapt the e-commerce capabilities framework toward understanding the  levels of m-business in firms.  In addition, as pointed in the gaps in Section 2.6.1, there is the need  to understand the development and deployment of firm resources to cre- ate products  m-business applications  and achieve benefits  for the firm .  None of the conceptual approaches identified in this review provides the  pathway to attaining this knowledge, hence the need to introduce one that  captures this gap succinctly. A conceptual approach of this nature may         34  Mobile Electronic Commerce  not exist specifically for the m-business area. However, deriving one from  the broader strategic management circle could inform and provide guide- lines  in  the  creation  of  an  m-business-specific  framework.  This  review  thus suggests the use of an established framework for studying how firms  configure resources to create value and achieve firm benefits, for example,  resource-based  theory,  and  its  later  extension—the  dynamic  capability  framework  Teece et al., 1997 .  Similarly, while we have some evidence about companies involving  customers  creating  value   Kristensson  et  al.,  2008 ,  we  should  consider  asking  whether  customers  are   external   resources  and  to  what  extent  they influence the value creation process. Obviously, customer feedback  would have to be captured to inform the value creation process, but from  the m-business perspective, what are the mobile technologies specifically  for this purpose—call it mobile knowledge management  KM . What KM  frameworks can help understand this? Similarly, scientific research needs  to  evaluate  the  applicability  and  fit  of  value  artifacts  created  with  cus- tomer input. In this regard, design science theory provides some useful  guidelines.  In addition, there is the need for frameworks that capture mobile use  and benefits obtained by firms in various industries. So far, attempts have  been  made  to  understand  this  dimension  from  the  perspective  of  indi- vidual users  e.g., Boateng, 2011 . There is the need for similar extensions  to  understand  firm-level  impacts  of  mobile  adoption.  According  to  the  evidence presented, research so far has borrowed from and extended the  benefits of using information and communication technologies  ICTs  in  commerce or trade  Amit and Zott, 2001; Boateng et al., 2008  to its mobile  equivalent.  For  instance,  the  mobile  for  development  perspective  posits  three effects that mobiles have on  adopters, that is, incremental, transfor- mational,  and  production   Batchelor  and  Scott,  2004;  Heeks  and  Jagun,  2007 .  Incremental  effects  are  those  benefits  from  using  mobile  phones  to improve what a firm already does, for example, communicating with   customers and partners. Transformational effects are benefits from using  the  mobile  phone  in  creating  new  things  or  accessing  new  services,  for  example, mobile banking. Production effects are benefits from trading in  or selling mobile phones and related services. Current benefits captured by  research relate to incremental and transformational effects; hence, there is  room for research into the production effects of mobiles, for example, how  mobile applications are created and sold to customers—both  individual  and corporate.  The  evidence  provided  in  the  previous  sections  suggests  that  tech- nology  acceptance  frameworks  and  theories  are  replete  in  m-business  research. Yet, since m-business focuses on the organizational or industrial  aspects  of  mobile  technology,  such  theories  have  been  seen  to  be  inad- equate in addressing interorganizational factors that have the potential to         Chapter two:  M-business issues and conceptual approaches  35  affect firms’ adoption intention and behavior in terms of mobile  technology   Pan et al., 2013 . Thus, in the move toward more organization-oriented  studies,  researchers  should  go  beyond  the  boundaries  of  such  theories,  by either operationalizing their constructs in specific mobile contexts or  developing new frameworks best suited for studying the particular con- text  see examples in Section 2.5 .  2.7  Conclusion and future research directions With a categorization and discussion of salient existing m-business lit- erature, we attempted to provide a general picture of the characteris- tics of past and current research into the m-business subcategories of  mobile  business  applications services;  economics,  strategy,  and  busi- ness  models;  and  consumer  acceptance adoption.  The  main  motiva- tions  for  the  review  are  that  first,  m-business  is  a  dynamic  area  that  needs continuous ongoing research  Ladd et al., 2010 . Reviews of this  nature  are  therefore  important  to  identify  and  close  over-researched  areas,  while  uncovering  new  areas.  Second,  even  though  past  m- business research had been criticized to be more of intuition-based  reasoning and conceptual analysis than empirical  Scornavacca et al.,  2006 , the past reviews did not analyze the conceptual approaches nor  the  methodological  approaches  used  in  those  previous  studies.  This  creates a gap in knowing which theories are replete and which need  attention.  Third,  this  review  explores  the  assertion  that  m-business  research was focused on consumer applications  Anckar et al., 2003 as  cited in Scornavacca et al., 2006 .  The findings in this review provide evidence that initial perceptions  are quite true. A transformation of the m-business research field as was  predicted by Scornavacca et al.  2006  can, however, not be guaranteed.  Nonetheless, a clear focus for future researchers would help grow the area  better. Especially, two main focal points informed by the issues, evidence,  and  past  theoretical  approaches  discussed  here  seem  fertile  for  future  m-business  research.  The  first  is  research  into  business  dimension  of  m-business: current research is skewed toward adoption issues—among  both  individual  and  corporate  consumers.  There  is  the  need  to  under- stand the process of developing firm resources to realize the consumer  value   as  proposed  by  the  business  model  argument .  The  internal  and  external conditions and factors resources that facilitate the process could  also be explored to a holistic understanding of the value creation process.  The second is theory development. Even though the IS discipline has key  theories, for example, TAM, there is the need for the development of key  theories specifically for m-business in order to grow the area. This may be  achieved by adapting and or testing such IS theories with the m-business  or m-computing subdiscipline.        36  Mobile Electronic Commerce  References Akturan, U. and Tezcan, N.  2012 .

While the retail industry has  started embracing this new technology and mostly by installing a WiFi hot- spot in their stores and shopping carts, the issues of security and reliability  have become serious concerns to both public and private organizations.  There is a large volume of literature on critical infrastructure of tele- communication system; however, the topic on mobile e-commerce, espe- cially  on  MANET,  still  offers  researchers  many  great  opportunities  for  new  ideas  and  designs  for  the  transmission  of  data.  This  chapter  will  present systematic review of the literature on MANET with the objective  of addressing security and reliability by studying the state of the art in  MANET  research  and  applications.  The  authors  try  to  identify  the  gap  between academia and industry and to point out the challenge and future  research directions. Eighty articles are collected, and the outputs of litera- ture review are categorized into four distinct categories: infrastructure,  security,  reliability,  and  academic  research  and  industry  solutions.  We  hope that the findings of this study will serve as a good source for those  interested  in  MANET.  The  chapter  also  presents  some  real-world  chal- lenges as well as future research directions.  3.2  M-commerce and infrastructure 3.2.1  Development of MANET and its characteristics New technology in telecommunication network infrastructure enables its  capability to be spread sparsely over large territories at a global scale to  provide  exceptional  coverage  and  to  impact  the  lives  of  large  numbers  of people. The new development of MANET communication caught the  attention  of  investigators  in  both  academia  and  industry.  MANET  is  becoming an industry standard, and some retailers are promoting new  customer services powered by MANET technology. The potential applica- tions of MANET will bring a landslide change to the customer relation- ship management and supply chain management. Thus, the security and  reliability of MANET are receiving immediate attentions from both pub- lic and private organizations. The advantage and potential applications of  MANET in retailing industry include the following:            1. Sharing  product  information  with  and  bringing  online  to  off-line    O2O  experiences to customers  2. Monitoring the movement of customer in the stores to understand   the customer’s behavior  3. Enabling customer to share shopping experience instantly        Chapter three:  Critical infrastructure management  47  In an environment where other telecommunication networks are unable  to  perform,  the  self-organization  capability  of  MANET  is  the  key,  in  that  it  can  provide  the  critical  communication  infrastructure  needed  to  effectively mobilize resources and share information. However, MANET  is  also  vulnerable  to  destruction  and  malicious  attacks  due  to  its  self- organization  capability.  Each  device   node   in  the  MANET  can  act  as  a  router  that  forwards  data  packets  to  other  devices   nodes   and  forms  a  very  dynamic  and  unpredictable  network  topology.  The  connectivity  of MANET depends on many internal and external factors, such as the  node’s density, the node’s count, and the lifetime of each node. The rout- ing protocols of the data packet in different layers of MANET are always  subject  to  destruction  and  attacks.  When  considering  security  and  reli- ability  of  MANET,  researchers  often  raise  questions  on  two  important  issues: disruption and influence. For example, in the MANET, the attacker  can disrupt routing of data packets by short-circuiting and taking over  the  control  of  multiple  nodes  using  a  wormhole  attack.  To  prevent  such  disruption attack, one can identify the critical components of the network  by utilizing traffic analysis and building a better protocol for data packet  routing. In the influence situation, if the objective is to improve the secu- rity  and  reliability  of  MANET,  one  can  deploy  relay  nodes  to  improve  the  stability  of  the  network  and  to  reduce  energy  consumption,  which  should result in better data packet routing protocols and improved load- ing schemes for the critical components. However, the two problems often  interact and coexist in many situations. For example, to prevent the black  hole attack on MANET, where the attacker pretends to be an authorized  node  when authorized nodes are temporarily down due to the power out- age or battery life  and responds to misrouted data packets to disrupt the  network, in this situation the task is to identify the critical components  to promote high availability and minimum downtime for the authorized  nodes  lower energy consumption for longer lifetime and less downtime   and to reduce the possibility of compromised networks by creating useful  redundancies   relay  nodes   to  improve  the  self-healing  structure  in  the  MANET.  In  addition,  unlike  other  forms  of  telecommunication  network,  MANET is extremely mobilized and characterized by complicated con- figuration. Other issues such as node hopping, node trustiness, and node  forward  incentive  are  also  needed  to  be  addressed  in  order  to  build  a  reliable  MANET  for  e-commerce.  The  systematic  approach  to  address- ing these issues is to study the critical components in the infrastructure  in the real-world setting and to propose solutions to protect the critical  components in a real-time manner. All these tasks require sophisticated  algorithms and better network topology. The modeling and analysis of  the dependencies and interdependencies among the critical components  within  the  same  critical  infrastructure  system  are  highly  complicated,         48  Mobile Electronic Commerce  and their behavior is highly nonlinear. Currently, great effort in critical  infrastructure management has focused on developing models to simu- late  the  behavior  of  critical  infrastructure  systems  and  to  discover  the  interdependencies  and  vulnerabilities  among  the  critical  infrastructure  system.  3.2.2  Rising popularity of MANET in mobile commerce The  concept  of  mobile  commerce  was  developed  in  the  early  stage  of  mobile  technology,  and  many  business  models  were  proposed  to  pro- vide products and services to customer without the limit of the time and   location.  Tsalgatidou  and  Pitoura   2001   discussed  the  business  models  using handheld terminals in mobile electronic commerce and transaction  issues for these business models defined by the special characteristics of  mobile terminals and wireless networks. However, these business models  put too much emphasis on the voice and text data, thus bringing limited  experience to the customer with high transaction cost due to the bottle- neck of bandwidth.  The  breakthrough  of  third-  and  later-generation  network  technol- ogy broke the bandwidth limitation on developing mobile commerce and  allowed business to promote complex e-commerce interaction with lower  transaction cost and higher transmission rate. The rich media and multi- dimensional interaction between the customers and retailers have added  tremendous value to the mobile e-commerce. The development of social  networks on the mobile platform also prompts retailers to chase innovated  business model. Some researchers  Kuo and Yu 2006, Hwang et al. 2007   investigated the core business models of 3G and 4G service providers and  their roles of developing mobile e-commerce. Recent survey by eDigital- Research showed that the fast connection on 4G network can accelerate the  mobile commerce and enable customer to locate a cheaper product from  both online and off-line stores by scanning bar codes   eDigitalResearch  2013 .  Cloud-based  4G  technology  can  provide  customer  and  retailer  a  comprehensive  platform  for  interaction  and  information  sharing.  In  addition, the outdated revenue generation models in the voice service  and the declining revenue caused by the intensive competition from ser- vice providers created opportunities for new value-added services built  on  the  next-generation  network   NGN   communication  platform.  The  demand  of  content-rich  and  multimedia  experience  from  the  customer  keeps  the  service  providers  on  enhancing  the  network  bandwidth  and  transmission  rate  in  order  to  improve  the  communication  efficiency  of  mobile  commerce. These value-added services not only create new reve- nue sources for service providers, but also help retailers develop new busi- ness strategy. For example, the standard components in smartphones such  as camera and GPS help retailers to deliver products and services to their         Chapter three:  Critical infrastructure management  49  customers anytime and anywhere; the sharing of information among cus- tomers also demonstrates that social group affects individual decisions on  purchasing. The availability of MANET infrastructure is a key to deliver  these services and to form a social group in the real time.  3.2.3  Value creation through mobile network To  understand  the  connection  between  new  value-added  services  and  associated business strategy, Chen and Cheng  2010  reported a study that  collected feedback from 35 industry and research institution experts and  scholars, using an analytic network process method to evaluate the strat- egy  of  mobile  service  providers  on  the  NGN.  The  authors  presented  an  evaluation framework for business strategy and discussed how the results  of their study can be used as guides for NGN service providers to  evaluate,  reposition,  and  improve  their  service  and  strategy.  In  the  meantime,  mobile networks provide opportunities for technology-based self-services  including e-government services and customer relationship management.  Kuo and Chen  2006  presented an analytical tool using the fuzzy synthetic  evaluation method based on analytic hierarchy process to select and evalu- ate the best mobile value-added service providers with the most customer  satisfaction. The results of this study not only assist consumers to choose  the  appropriate  service  providers  from  the  other  consumers’  opinions,  but also help the provider to catch the potential market trend of mobile  value-added services based on the prevailing consumer patterns. A recent  study  by  Venkatesh  et  al.   2012   on  a  web-based  survey  of  2465  citizens  showed  four  key  attributes  that  influenced  the  adoption  and  use  of  the  e- government services. One of the key attributes is the security provision. One of the most attractive value-added services is mobile banking in  e-commerce. The mobile banking breaks the boundary of time and space  limitation of commerce activity and lowers the transaction costs compared  to  the  conventional  banking.  Many  retailers  have  adopted  the  mobile  banking technology and enhanced their customer services. For example,  customers in the Starbuck stores can use their mobile phone to pay for their  cups of Java. In many countries, customers can simply use their mobile  phones to pay for products and services from soft drinks in the vending  machines to movie theater tickets. The mobile cash and advanced autho- rization methods can improve the security of online  payment, thus bring  convenience  to  the  customer.  The  new  fingerprint  and  face   recognition  technology in the mobile phone can lower the risk associated with using  mobile banking and eliminate the complication of credit card  purchase  in some business environments. The replacement of lost and misplaced  credit  card  by  the  customers  and  the  stolen  credit  card  data  by  the  retailers cost businesses millions of dollars every year. In some African  countries,  conventional  Internet  banking  service  is  not  available  due  to         50  Mobile Electronic Commerce  the lack of infrastructure. Mobile banking can now  provide low cost and  efficient banking service to the customer and business under such condi- tions. The project using whitespace spectrum initiated by Google creates  opportunities to the people living in an isolated community by improving  their  quality  of  life;  the  technology  lays  the  foundation  for  mobile  net- work  infrastructure   Welch  2013 .  Even  in  the  countries  with  advanced  infrastructure  for  wired  Internet  service  such  as  India  and  China,  the  conventional money order service is inefficient and inconvenient to cus- tomers. Customers spent lots of time in the long waiting lines and shared  the high transaction cost. Both countries have large technologically disad- vantaged migrant workers population, and customers have to visit banks  or post offices to send money to their family due to the lack of computer  and home Internet service. Thus, the demand of mobile money transfer  creates opportunity for banks and mobile service  providers. Singh  2012   reported a study to examine the feasible business model for mobile bank- ing  to  integrate  Indian  Post  with  banking  sectors  on  the  mobile  com- munication platform in order to provide efficient and lower cost money  transfer services to migrant worker. The authors identified the factors for  justifying the demand of mobile money order and analyzed the issues of  slow adoption of mobile banking. In fact, in many countries, the lack of  consumer confidence in security and reliability of mobile platform is the  key reason for resistance of slow adoption of mobile banking as a main  banking service. The slow implementation of security and  reliability strat- egy by banking sectors cannot keep pace with the development of mobile  commerce.  In  addition,  the  mobile  commerce  growth  is  always  related  to the development of mobile payment service markets that is still under  transition due to the potential new technology innovation for mobile net- work  infrastructure,  such  as  MANET.  Dahlberg  et  al.   2008   reported  a  literature  review  study  on  the  current  state  of  the  mobile  payment  ser- vices market. They proposed a framework using a classic model of four  contingency and five competitive force factors after analyzing a variety  of  factors  that  influence  the  markets  of  mobile  payment  services.  They  pointed out that the social and cultural factors on mobile payments, as  well  as  comparisons  between  mobile  and  traditional  payment  services,  are entirely uninvestigated issues. The directions for future research in  this continuing emerging field are discussed.  Another  widely  developed  value-added  service  is  location-based  mobile  service.  The  potential  of  location-based  mobile  applications  and  intensive computing demand have attracted the attention from both acad- emy and industry. The hardware and software developers have proposed  different  mechanisms  to  process  the  location-dependent  queries.  The  quality of location-based mobile service depends on the efficiency of the  queries and the precision of the computing results. Unlike static coordi- nating online services on the wired Internet platform, the location-based         Chapter three:  Critical infrastructure management  51  mobile services required intensive computing and continuous processing  due to the changes of coordinates of customer. For example, to collect the  data of customer purchasing behavior inside a retail store, the location- based  service  needs  to  pinpoint  the  movement  of  customers  with  high  precision and record the time spent by the customer on particular items  or shelves. The location data in this application will be collected in a fine  granularity and precision. To deliver the information on products or ser- vices to the customer, based on their locations in such environment, loca- tion data need to be refreshed automatically as customers move around  the  store.  It  is  highly  challenging  to  the  service  provider  on  delivering  high-quality services without draining the battery power of the mobile  devices  from  the  customers.  MANET  can  provide  a  good  performance  distributed system to process the queries without expensive computing  processes.  It  not  only  increases  the  flexibility  of  network  communica- tion and reduces power consumption of the location queries considerably  but also performs the location-based service efficiently. Veijalainen et al.   2006  present a requirement analysis for the location-based e-commerce  transactions using a graphic model based on a transaction manager  TM   architecture  to  protect  e-commerce  workflows  against  communication  links, applications, or crashes. This system can be applied to monitor con- straints related to the security and reliability of critical components in the  network.  To  provide  value-added  services  to  customers,  several  innovated  mobile  business  models  have  been  proposed.  Figge   2004   introduces  a   situation-dependent service model based on the spatial dimension, per- sonal  dimension,  and  temporal  dimension  of  the  customer  and  service  provider, which is considered as a situation provider based on the situa- tion description. The author also discussed issues related to organization,  technology, and security of situation dependency in mobile e-commerce.  Huang et al.  2009  proposed a hierarchical mobile agent framework for  handling key management and access control problems between mobile  agent  and  host.  The  proposed  method  can  improve  the  security  of  key  management and mobile control accesses by managing the accessing rela- tionship between the mobile agents and the host and operate storage space  efficiently  in  a  distributed  environment,  which  is  important  to  nonspe- cific network such as MANET. Jiang et al.  2010  proposed a collaborative   business model with optimal profit among the portal access service pro- vider  PASP , the product service provider  PSP , and the mobile service  provider  MSP  as a multi agent system for mobile business. To achieve  the optimal profit, the authors presented an agent evolution algorithm for  computation  and  used  a  simulation  experiment  to  show  how  the  deci- sion makers choose the profit-oriented strategies. The results of this study   indicated that the collaborative mechanism can help players to achieve a  better performance at a low level of risk. Esparza et al.  2006  discussed         52  Mobile Electronic Commerce  the  use  of  mobile  agent  technology  in  brokerage  systems  to  accelerate  the development of a massive use of mobile e-commerce application and  pointed out the security issues that hinder its use. In the next section, we  will discuss the security issues related to MANET infrastructure in mobile  e-commerce.  3.3  Security issues on MANET 3.3.1  Urgent need for better MANET security solutions The self-organized nature of MANET infrastructure leads to the vulnera- bility of security threats and makes it much easier to suffer from numerous  attacks than the conventional wired network. In addition, nodes within  MANET have unreliable links due to the energy supply and constantly  changing topology. All these features make MANET extremely vulner- able to security attacks that exploit its inherent weakness, and this also  leads  to  the  proliferation  of  attacks  specifically  designed  for  MANET.  Thus, the security concerns for the MANET become prominent given the  rising popularity of its application. Park et al.  2011  provided a brief over- view  of  the  state-of-the-art  research  on  the  security  issues  on  MANET.  Datta and Marchang  2012  discussed a wide range of attacks that are of  special research importance. In their study, these attacks are divided into  two subgroups: active and passive, determined by the behavioral pattern  of such attacks, that is, whether they bring disturbance to the function of  the network or just intercept key information from this system. They sub- sequently presented several basic techniques used for protecting MANET  from such attacks, most of which are of research importance.  3.3.2  Attacks exploiting MANET’s inherent weakness The  data  packets  moving  among  the  nodes  are  controlled  by  the  rout- ing protocol without much security features included. MANET is often  characterized  by  the  lack  of  secured  boundaries,  Byzantine  failure  of  comprised nodes, absence of centralized management facility, restricted  power supply, and poor scalability. For example, the restricted power sup- ply can lead to a denial-of-service  DoS  attack. Researchers classified the  attacks on MANET infrastructure as internal and external based on the  source and as active and passive based on the behavior. In this section,  we discuss the various security issues in MANET infrastructure based  on the literature.  First of all, DoS is the common external attack to both wireless and  wired network. For example, Ack-storm DoS attacks pose a renewed threat  to the network by taking advantage of a flawed design in Transmission  Control Protocol  TCP  specifications. Theoretically, such attack could be         Chapter three:  Critical infrastructure management  53  amplified by unlimited times and they can be easily initiated in a large  scale to fight against access network or to block web server even by a very  weak man-in-the-middle attacker  MitM . Abramov and Herzberg  2013   found two simple ways to prevent Ack-storm DoS attacks—one through  a simple fix in a client or server and the other through a packet-filtering  firewall. To prevent DoS attack, Agah et al.  2006  presented a study on the  design of security enforcement mechanism through the lens of auction  theory. In the new protocol, nodes compete with each other in “ forwarding  incoming packets and gaining reputation in the network” on the basis of  auction theory. Maximum bids are based on the node’s utility value; thus,  untruthfully  bidding  nodes  will  be  identified  and  therefore  isolated  in  order to prevent DoS attack; this novel protocol is called secure auction– based routing. In addition, the authors discussed the defense strategy in  light  of  game  theory.  They  found  that  eventually  in  a  “noncooperative,  two-player, non-zero-sum game between an attacker and a wireless sen- sor network  WSN ,” the game moves toward Nash equilibrium, which  finally leads to two new strategies. One synthesizes the overall utility of all  the en-route nodes in data packet, “where utility is the difference between  gain and cost for each node,” and the other utilizes a rating system where  wireless nodes receive rating from its neighboring nodes. The proposed  game theory–based framework is supported by simulation results in terms  of improving defense strategy for the WSN which is a type of MANET.  A more recent attempt to prevent MANET from DoS attacks is done by  Jia et al.  2013 , in which CapMan, a security mechanism based on par- ticipating nodes’ capability, is presented. By its design, CapMan is able to  monitor both the capability limit of and the real-time traffic flow through  a node. Each node’s traffic situation is summarized and exchanged within  the  whole  network.  Because  of  this,  nodes  are  able  to  make  informed  decision and better regulate the traffic. CapMan is implemented through  simulations extensively, and the results show that CapMan can effectively  thwart even sophisticated DoS attacks.  Improvements made on routing protocols  3.3.3  In MANET, mobile devices are connected via wireless links. In such a net- work, nodes change locations very often, thus posing special difficulty for  routing algorithm to address the changing topology. Given that there are  various protocols available and every protocol is best for a particular set- ting,  Joshi   2011   discusses  the  security  issues  and  what  can  be  done  to  address those security issues on network layer. Security design is a key  function for any type of network. For MANET, which relies on the mobile  nodes to accomplish connection and is characterized by dynamic topol- ogy, the security design is of special importance. Komninos et al.  2006   discussed the major security issues regarding MANET at the data link and         54  Mobile Electronic Commerce  network layers  and paid attention to the security requirement in security  design for these two layers. Komninos et al.  2007  further investigated the  design requirement for MANET in light of multiple authentication pro- tocols  and  reported  a  study  focusing  on  the  authentication  process  in  a  layered approach. They also performed simulation to test the several such  protocols  and  suggest  multiple  lines  of  defense  to  improve  the  security  of  MANET  infrastructure.  In  addition,  Shim  and  Lee   2005   identified  the  security flaws related to the protocols for authentication and key establish- ment. Their study revealed a new kind of attack: known key-share attack  when the communication protocols in MANET failed to provide authen- tication. In addition, Karyotis and Papavassiliou  2007  studied an attack  strategy based on a probabilistic model to maximize the disruption caused  by  those  attacks.  Considering  the  dynamic  topology  of  MANET,  this  proposed  model  contains  a  topology  control  algorithm  which  is  able  to  evaluate the capability, resources, and characteristics of a target network.  In so doing, those attacks are expected to cause greater impact on target  MANET. The test results show that the proposed algorithm is more effec- tive than any other flat and threshold-based approaches. Adnane et al.  2013   conducted a comprehensive analysis on the trust-based routing protocol  Optimized Link State Routing  OLSR , presented a detailed review of the  reasoning process utilized by the node to form a trust value under OLSR  protocol, and provided their own modification on the prevailing OLSR pro- tocol. Garcia-Morchon et al.  2013  also examined the mechanism of such  routing protocols that exercise trust management. Based on their distinct  perspective,  a  modified  trust-based  protocol  is  proposed  in  this  study,  which emphasizes the two voting procedures, one for node admission and  the other for node elimination. More commonly, building on established  and well-performing protocols to make incremental improvement to these  protocols  is  also  a  practically  meaningful  approach.  von  Mulert  et  al.   2012  presented their Secure Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector  AODV    protocol, which is built on the established AODV protocol. Their  newly  proposed protocol incorporates cryptographic mechanism so as to keep  the message transmitted within the network from being faked or altered.  Given the unstable nature of the nodes in the mobile network, there  are also protocols designed to address such security issues of MANET.  Malavenda et al.  2012  presented a novel protocol that is delay tolerant  and energy saving after a thorough examination of state-of-the-art pro- tocols of such type. Their proposed protocol has been approved as good  and even outperformed the most prevailing mechanism given the experi- mental results.  Since there are many routing protocols available for security improve- ment, it is equally important to measure the effectiveness of these proposed  protocols so that protocols with better safety parameters could stand out.  There  are  some  standards  that  specify  the  requirements  which  include         Chapter three:  Critical infrastructure management  55  X.800 and X.805. Almomani et al.  2013  based their analysis on these stan- dards  and  proposed  their  logic-based  security  architecture,  which  can  systematically analyze the security requirement a protocol could achieve  and give mathematical proof. Based on their proposed architecture, they  presented their analysis results for many prevailing protocols.  MANET is considered as a pervasive and ubiquitous network which  is vulnerable to internal attack such as the Byzantine failure caused by  the  compromised  nodes.  The  traditional  access  control  and  authentica- tion  become  inadequate  when  it  comes  to  pervasive  and  ubiquitous  environment, especially after new technology emerged. To build a reliable  pervasive  network,  Boukerche  and  Ren   2008   proposed  a  “reputation- based  trust  system  which  assigns  credentials  to  nodes,  updates  private  keys,  managing  trust  value  and  makes  decision.”  This  system  is  tested  to show that it can effectively identify malicious nodes and take proper  action to protect the pervasive network. For the pervasive network, flood- ing is an effective method when it comes to secure routing application. But  it  also  has  flaws  such  as  extreme  redundancy,  which  often  causes  broad- cast  storm  and  even  system  failure  because  of  the  number  of  collision.  Gossip  is  a  probabilistic  algorithm  used  to  reduce  the  number  of  retrans- mission  by  calculating  the  retransmission  probability.  Burmester  et  al.   2007   reported  a  study  to  reduce  the  problem  of  retransmission  while  retaining as much security as possible by presenting “several new gossip  protocols which exploit local connectivity to adaptively correct propaga- tion failures and protect against Byzantine attacks.” Because there is no  infrastructure in MANET, the communication among nodes is conducted  by the nodes themselves. Thus, the cooperation between nodes becomes  critical in order to establish a route for communication. For various rea- sons such as capacities and batteries, some nodes may turn to misbehave  and such nodes usually complicate the routing process. Gopalakrishnan  and Rhymend Uthariaraj  2012  proposed a solution to mitigate the effect  of  those  misbehaving  nodes  by  introducing  a  collaborative  polling–based  routing security scheme, which is effective in detecting and isolating mis- behaving nodes. This approach is supposed to reduce false detection. The  test results show reduced packet drop ratio and malicious drop. As we  move  to  a  ubiquitous  computing  environment,  the  risk  management  becomes more and more critical because of the complexity of the connec- tivity. Hayat et al.  2007  try to find out what effect the traditional infor- mation security triangle is going to experience and how the information  security requirement is going to be influenced. Special attention has been  paid to the need for risk management and context-based access control as  well as proactive threat assessment techniques. Clustering in MANET refers  to  the  method  that  groups  nodes  in  different  clusters.  Usually,  there  is  a managing node in each cluster, also called clusterhead. In the current  body of knowledge, little concern has been given to the trust level of head         56  Mobile Electronic Commerce  nodes in the selection process of clusterhead for internal attack. Elhdhili  et al.  2008  proposed a clustering algorithm for security in MANET called  CASAN, which focuses on the trustworthiness, stability, and energy of a  potential node. The authors also tested this algorithm through simulation  as well as comparison with other clustering techniques, and all these tests  show positive evidence in support of CASAN. This approach can be used  to identify the critical infrastructure in MANET.  3.3.4  Concerns and strategies for information assurance In  order  to  safeguard  sensitive  information  and  networks,  usually  we  solve such security issues at the cost of the quality of service  QoS , espe- cially  for  networks  with  strong  constraints  such  as  MANET.  Aiache  et  al.   2008  proposed a solution for MANET to more efficiently combat viral  attacks without compromising much QoS, and evidence of its effective- ness is provided. This is more effective when the approach is used as an  automated  process  in  the  route  discovery  phase  because  it  uses  model  checking  approach  to  evaluate  protocol  abstraction.  It  will  evaluate  the  security properties of MANET when an attacker is attempting to corrupt  the  process  of  discovering  routes.  Andel  et  al.   2011   developed  a  new  topology reduction technique to lower the computational requirements.  The  study  by  Ben  Othman  and  Mokdad   2010   focused  on  a  multipath  to  improve  the  confidentiality  in  transmission.  Specifically,  in  this  pro- posed approach, original message will be split into different parts, then  encrypted and transmitted through different disjointed paths to receivers. The  security can be improved in that it is unlikely for attackers to intercept all  the parts, increasing the confidentiality of data transmission. The authors  also compared this approach with other multipath solutions and provided  performance evaluation.  Password authentication is among the most widely used methods in  ensuring network security. Its application to the newly emerged network  system such as MANET does not provide the same security because the  availability  and  strong  protection  against  off-line  guessing  attacks  are  not  considered  conventional  password  authentication  designs.  Chai  et  al.   2007  proposed a threshold password authentication scheme, which can solve  the  problems  presented  earlier.  In  this  proposed  scheme,  it  only  takes  two rounds of message exchange to complete a jointly authentication pro- cess by several server nodes. This new scheme is of potential popularity  because no password table is to be stored in server nodes. Other research- ers presented a scheme to improve the security of MANET by mimicking  the military structure which personnel at different levels have access to  different resources and create a multilevel structure in MANET to restrict  the access of critical information to the nodes at different levels  Changda  and Shiguang 2008 .        Chapter three:  Critical infrastructure management  57  3.3.5  Wireless sensor network and its security issues With more wireless sensors or sensing devices deploying to MANET,  the  security  issues  of  a  WSN  become  challenging  to  the  business.  Since  the  sensor  systems  are  always  used  in  high-risk  environment  and the security of sensors is always a concern, Bialas  2010  reported  a  study  to  look  at  a  widely  used  method  in  maintaining  sensor’s  assurance, which is Common Criteria  ISP IEC 15408 . The result from  this study contributes to the existing knowledge by providing common  criteria  CC –related security design patterns and to improve the effectiveness  of the sensor development process. Among security challenges raised by  mobile WSNs, clone attack is particularly dreadful since it makes an  adversary able to subvert the behavior of a network by just leveraging  a  few  replicas  of  some  previously  compromised  sensors.  Conti  et  al.   2013  introduced two novel realistic adversary models, the vanishing  and the persistent adversary, characterized by different compromising  capabilities. The authors then proposed two distributed, efficient, and  cooperative protocols to detect replicas: History Information–Exchange  Protocol   HIP   and  its  optimized  version   HOP .  Both  HIP  and  HOP  leverage just local  one-hop  communications and node mobility, and  differ for the amount of computation required. Both analysis and sim- ulation results showed that their solutions are effective and efficient to  provide high detection rate with the limited overhead. Based on these  encouraging  results,  the  authors  proposed  two  distributed  protocols  to detect replica attacks in mobile WSNs, which provide fast detection  even  with  just  a  single  clone  in  the  network.  Actuation  poses  a  new  threat  on  the  security  of  sensor  network  when  it  is  used  in  a  physi- cal environment. Czarlinska and Kundur  2007  examined a new kind  of actuation attacks that focus on sensor fidelity and reliability of the  sensor network; they furthermore proposed a strategy to protect sen- sor network from such actuation attacks based on a controlled level of  random  mobility.  They  further  provided  evidence  showing  this  pro- posed  new  scheme  is  effective  in  reducing  affected  nodes  over  time  as  well as improvements in the resilience and tolerance for fault in network.  To address different requirements on data transmission and network  constraints on a special type of wireless sensor and actuator networks   WSANs ,  Hu  et  al.   2007   proposed  a  ripple-zone   RZ -based  rout- ing  scheme  that  characterizes  by  scalability  and  energy  efficiency  to  achieve  better  information  security.  In  this  new  scheme,  a  two-level  rekeying rerouting scheme is also proposed; this new scheme is able  to adapt to dynamic topology as well as to securely update keys for each data  transmission  session.  This  proposed  scheme  has  been  tested  through  extensive  simulations  and  experiments  and  is  proved  effective  in  information security for WSANs.        58  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Integrative security framework  3.3.6  So far, we have discussed the different techniques that one can utilize  to  strengthen  the  security  of  MANET.  Since  these  techniques  often  have varying focus, grounded in different theoretic basis, and can be  applied in different scenarios, thus, many researchers are working on  building an integrative framework that incorporate elements from dif- ferent  security  strategies  to  make  a  comprehensive  defense  system.  Such effort can be illustrated as the framework presented in Lacey et al.   2012 .  In  this  study,  the  authors  propose  a  reputation-based  Internet  protocol security  RIPsec  framework under which links and nodes are  encrypted,  nodes’  behavior  is  monitored  and  graded  under  a  reputa- tion system, and message exchange is secured by certificate protection.  This framework incorporates existing techniques and forms a compre- hensive security solution; it is also proved to be more effective against  existing attacks based on simulation results. Bankovic et al.  2011  put  together  a  network  routing  protocol  and  an  intrusion  detection  sys- tem  IDS  to form a new security solution. This new solution utilizes a  reputation-based scheme to neutralize its internal threats and leverage  an  unsupervised  algorithm  to  analyze  abnormal  behavior,  and  most  importantly, identify attacks that may be unknown beforehand. There  are also some frameworks and solution designed specifically for unique  situation.  The  security  solution  presented  in  Cionca  et  al.   2012   pro- vides integrative protection to sensor networks that are mostly used in  hostile environment.  3.4  Reliability issues 3.4.1  Difficulties to maintain a reliable mobile network The  vulnerability  of  critical  mobile  communication  infrastructures  in  highly mobilized community to extreme events is one of the great chal- lenges in today’s society. MANET consists of a set of independent mobile  devices  nodes  that communicate with each other in a decentralized man- ner. It is often highly dynamic in topology since node mobility changes  the  existence  and  quality  of  links.  The  existence  and  quality  of  links,  however, impose remarkable impact on the reliability of networks. Given  the importance of the quality of links, it is necessary to incorporate path  lifetime into routing strategy. The path lifetime, however, is not analyti- cally available, thus, in Yuste et al.  2013 , a fuzzy logic–based algorithm  is suggested in an attempt to estimate the reliability and quality of a link  with higher accuracy after taking path lifetime into account. A successful  incorporation of the algorithm is shown to lead to improved routing effi- cacy and energy consumption.        Chapter three:  Critical infrastructure management  59  The highly dynamic nature of MANET makes its reliability  analysis  hard. In a recent paper of Zhao et al.  2013 , a new reliability analysis model  has been proposed that takes node mobility effect and node reliability into  consideration. The results reveal that node mobility has a greater effect on  terminal reliability than the quality of link.  The robustness of MANET configuration poses difficulty to conven- tional reliability methods  e.g., reliability block  diagram , because  there  is no standard structure or configuration to define all types of MANET.  Therefore, many new methods are designed to improve the reliability of  MANET  by  taking  into  consideration  the  differential  configurations  or  mobility models. The MANET with better design and configuration have  improved stability and reliability, as is shown in Wang  2014 , in which  two  hierarchies’  cluster-based  MANET  configuration  is  designed.  The  first hierarchy consists of head nodes and associate nodes, and the sec- ond hierarchy has only one head and multiple member nodes. The clus- ter head is the one that has the most member nodes; the communication  between head nodes is conducted through only one associate node; algo- rithms for merging clusters are also provided. This proposed configura- tion demonstrates remarkable improvements in terms of key performance  parameters.  Building  on  this  configuration,  a  following  study,  Xiaonan  and Huanyan  2013 , was conducted to show that the IP address can be  better configured under such structure because each cluster can perform  this  process  separately.  On  the  same  issue,  Wang  and  Qian   2013   sug- gested  a  tree-based  configuration  and  an  algorithm  for  address  assign- ment. In this proposed configuration, IP resource is distributed by proxy  nodes  and  the  communication  among  these  proxy  nodes  is  within  one  hop, which minimizes the cost of communication and the address is auto- matically retrievable, further reducing resource waste.  3.4.2  State-of-the-art research on reliability issue of MANET Most of the existing works on the reliability of MANET have been consid- ering binary link model w.r.t. transmission range and distance between  the transmitter and the receiver. It is obvious that such model lacks prac- tical consideration. In reality, the success of a transmission undergoes a  probability, which is determined by the signal strength, fading, interfer- ences, etc. The resiliency of failure during extreme events for the MANET  can be defined as the MANET’s ability to maintain network communi- cation in the event of external failures. It can be measured by  the time  to restore service during the external failures. It is critical to ensure the  MANET  resiliency  when  the  specific  critical  components  fail  without  warnings  caused  by  external  events.  Whitson  and  Ramirez-Marquez   2009   discussed  the  methods  for  safeguarding  critical  infrastructure  components of MANET and for optimizing the use of redundancy as a         60  Mobile Electronic Commerce  strategic approach to improve MANET resiliency in the future. Despite  the availability and easy-to-access of telecommunication technology such  as MANET, the major challenge in adopting MANET is the lack of trust  among the customers using MANET because of their lack of experience on  using the technology. The spread of misleading or inaccurate information  within MANET can also lead to unfavorable consequences in the practi- cal situation. Thus, in order to facilitate collaboration on using MANET,  the customers have to possess the ability of assessing the trustworthiness  of  the  propagated  information  by  other  customers.  Some  decentralized  trust  models  are  proposed  to  enhance  reliable  information  dissemina- tion  Qureshi et al. 2010, 2012, Zyba et al. 2011 . These models contain the  distributed recommendation scheme. The scheme is built into decentral- ized trust model based on an existing membership service for MANET.  Additionally,  the  mechanism  for  the  trust-based  information  propaga- tion is based on a nature-inspired spreading model that can establish an  immediate and robust of trust among the nodes with the feature of pre- vention  of  flooding  information  from  the  multi-hop  routes  in  MANET.  Wang et al.  2011  proposed a trusted route that considers communication  reliability and path length for a reliable and feasible packet delivery in a MANET.  This study considered security as an integrated part of routing protocol  in the MANET routing scheme, instead of applying additional layer to the  basic routing layer. Nodes in MANET use a set of attributes to calculate  the trust levels of others nodes based on the similarity between attributes  and adopt a new forwarding rule for information propagation. This new  trusted routing protocol generated the better results on preventing black  hole attacks than the Dynamic Source Routing  DSR  protocol based on  the routing performance parameters such as node’s account, range, and  speed  of  transmission.  Another  update  made  on  DSR  is  the  modified  dynamic source routing  MDSR  protocol presented in Mohanapriya and  Krishnamurthi  2013 . Under MDSR, IDS is not activated until a malicious  node is detected and this would significantly reduce the energy consump- tion. This is achieved by configuring an IDS system that detects abnormal  data packet forwarding activities. Once anomaly is detected, the nearby  IDS is turned into active mode and broadcast blocking messages to nodes  that have contact with the malicious nodes hence to isolate such nodes.  This modified protocol is found to have a 64% reduction in data packet  loss and lower energy usage compared to DSR. In addition to the mecha- nisms updated through traditional means, research in effective counter- intrusion schemes also draws upon different perspectives. A novel IDS  system,  which  is  called  biological-based  artificial  intrusion  detection  system  BAIDS , is suggested by Sundararajan et al.  2014 . Together with  hybrid negative selection algorithm, BAIDS is able to differentiate normal  behaving nodes and malicious nodes with improved accuracy and it is  also designed to combat wormhole attack in MANET.        Chapter three:  Critical infrastructure management  61  As MANET is often deployed in malicious attacks environments, it  is important to implement intrusion detection techniques to prevent with  both internal and external attacks and improve the system reliability. Jin- Hee et al.  2010  reported a study on analyzing the performance of IDS  techniques on the reliability of MANET. Unlike the traditional wired net- work IDS, the IDS on MANET should be performed to maximize the mean  time to failure of the system at the optimal rate based on the operational  conditions  and  attacker  behaviors.  Padmavathy  and  Chaturvedi   2013   proposed  to  use  a  propagation-based  link  reliability  model  with  nodes  failure under a known distribution to study the reliability issue via Monte  Carlo simulation. They illustrated their method with an application and  gave  some  imperative  conclusions.  Cook  and  Ramirez-Marquez   2008   presented applicable reliability metrics for MANET based on networking  resources, such as bandwidth and energy. Chen et al.  2012  developed a  random waypoint  RWP  mobility model to investigate the two-terminal  reliability  of  the  MANET  and  used  the  model  to  describe  the  mobility  pattern of mobile users in MANET. The authors implemented the analyti- cal method to present the expressions for one- and two-hop connectivity  to measure the two-terminal reliability. The central tendency in the RWP  model leads to its capability on assessing the effect of node’s density and  network topology on MANET’s reliability where the model is constructed  as  a source node location function due to the  asymptotic spatial distri- bution  of  nodes.  Zhao  et  al.   2013   reported  a  study  using  Monte  Carlo  method for two-terminal reliability and modeled and analyzed the node’s  reliability and mobility effect.  The  routing  protocol  possesses  a  critical  influence  on  MANET  reli- ability. Xie et al.  2008  proposed a hybrid routing protocol known as the  link reliability–based hybrid routing  LRHR . LRHR can establish multiple  paths between a pair of source–destination nodes under the  multiple paths  routing strategy that is different from traditional single-path routing and  multipath routing strategies. Due to some circumstances such as resource  or availability, the traditional multipath routing can be downgraded into  a single path and lose the advantages of multipath mechanism. In the new  LRHR routing strategy, the change rate of network topology can provide  a  routing  strategy  for  switching  dynamically  between  table-driven  and  on-demand manner. In order to improve the source– destination path reli- ability, the authors presented an adaptive  multipath routing mechanism with  path  segment,  in  which  multipath  can  be  established  as  part  of  the   end-to-end  path. Thus, the reliability of the MANET can be improved by dividing the  end-to-end path into several short segments. Zhen et al.  2010  presented  a  parallel  forwarding  mechanism  to  guarantee  the  QoS  of  multimedia  services over MANET using the same strategy. In addition, other routing  protocols are proposed for MANET to improve bandwidth and energy uti- lization. For example, Chang et al.  2009  introduced the Multicast Ad hoc         62  Mobile Electronic Commerce  On-Demand  Distance  Vector   MAODV   routing  protocol  for  achieving  multicast in MANET. It is known that data packets  transmission through  a multicast tree in the MANET often passes through the unreliable links  due  to  the  mobility  or  lack  of  energy  supply,  which  may  significantly  degrade the performance of MANET. MAODV uses a  broadcast-type local  repair mechanism to locate the alternative route of the multicast tree when  lost links occur. The proposed unicast-type multi hop local repair proto- col for multicast in MANET can recover the lost links quickly to improve  the network reliability. In addition, it can improve the packet delivery rate,  reduce the number of control messages, and repair delay. The construction  of multicast trees is built upon the optimal number of hops in the multi- hop neighborhood based on the critical components in the infrastructure.  As opposed to the multicasting approach used in MAODV, Liang et al.   2012  introduced a cross-layer unicasting local repair mechanism in try- ing to avoid such unfavorable outcomes caused by MAODV as extensive  message overload and large energy consumption when broken links occur  in a network. Their newly proposed mechanism is proved to be able to  alleviate the congestion caused by broken links by informing the senders  of such situation; it is also able to identify optimal alternative path.  Other  broadcast  methods  such  as  gossip-based  broadcasting  are  promising solution for efficient information dissemination in large-scale  applications  under  distributed  environment  of  MANET.  For  better  reli- ability against node failures, Tsuchiya et al.  2006  developed a counter- based optimization for gossip-based broadcasting. The key design is that  node rebroadcasts a message when it has received the copy of the message  a few times. This way, a node can confirm the status of message dissemi- nation and copy it to the others at appropriate time.  Self-healing routing protocols are indispensable to handle topologi- cal changes due to node mobility in dynamic networks such as MANETs.  Furthermore,  many  emerged  time-critical  MANET  applications,  e.g.,  disaster response, rescue missions, and battlefield operations, should be  able  to  support  real-time,  reliable  data  streaming  with  efficient  energy  consumption.  However,  most  of  the  current  energy-efficient  routing  protocols depend on configuration parameters which must be obtained  prior  to  the  deployment  phase.  Mukherjee  et  al.   2009   designed  a   self-managing, energy-efficient multicast routing protocol suite based on  a  self-stabilization paradigm. The suite includes   i  WECM, a Waste Energy Cost Metric designed for  energy-efficient route selection,  ii  SS-SPST-E, a Self- Stabilizing,  Shortest-Path  Spanning  Tree  protocol  for Energy efficiency based on WECM to maintain  an  energy-efficient,  self-healing  routing  structure,   iii   SS-SPST-E  fc,  an  enhanced  SS-SPST-E  with         Chapter three:  Critical infrastructure management  63  fault containment to decrease stabilization latency,   iv   AMO,  an  Analytical  Model  for  Optimization  framework to reduce the route maintenance mecha- nism’s  energy  overhead,  and   v   self-configuration  mechanisms  observing,  estimating,  and  dissemi- nating the optimization parameters.  The proposed suite can address the issues such as wasted overhead energy,  change rate of route and link selection under stabilization latency, and the  intensity of application data transmission and delivery requirement.  Robust routing protocol should also consider the battery exhaustion.  The study by Takeuchi et al.  2013  is the best example in this regard. The  authors  provided  an  updated  version  of  their  routing  protocol  named  Route-Split  Routing   RSR ,  built  on  their  previously  proposed  protocol  which falls short when node’s battery exhausts.  3.5  Academic research and industry solutions In MANET, each node can perform the function of router to form dynamic  links when it moves randomly within the network. Implementing security  and  improving  reliability  in  such  dynamically  changing  environments  are  extremely  challenging.  Both  academic  and  industrial  investigators  should  consider  the  MANET  characteristics  in  designing  efficient  solu- tions to address both issues. Recently, some academic research and indus- try  solutions  have  been  proposed  to  address  security  and  reliability  in  MANET  in  terms  of  nodes  authentication  and  availability,  information  confidentiality, routing security, and detecting malicious intrusion. First,  there are multiple paths between the nodes in MANET infrastructures.  Data  transmission  is  controlled  by  the  multipath  routing  protocol.  The  original data can be secured by splitting into packets with encryption and  composition  mechanisms.  Then,  a  variety  of  disjointed  paths  between  source  and  destination  are  used  for  data  packets  transmission.  Even  if  an attacker can obtain one or more transmitted packets successfully, the  attacker will have a very low probability to reconstitute the original mes- sage. Ben Othman and Mokdad  2010  proposed a securing data–based  multipath routing protocol for MANET to prevent eavesdropping. Second,  the basic routing protocol between the nodes in MANET is based on the  trust levels. Each node will be calculating the trust values and association  statuses for all of its neighboring nodes. Bhalaji and Shanmugam  2012   developed a trust-based DSR protocol to identify and isolate the grayhole  nodes. Hadjichristofi et al.  2011  introduced a new routing protocol for  MANET that can utilize connectivity, quality of routes and links, or any  other information to improve the routing decision. The new protocol uti- lizes multiple mechanisms combining routing, security, and monitoring         64  Mobile Electronic Commerce  to  support  the  concurrent  use  of  IPv6  and  IPv4  addresses  and  design  network topologies with less energy consumption and less interference  based on the connectivity information from the routing. It can build trust  decisions among the nodes in MANET using the integrated trust compo- nent to support IPsec deployment and establish secure paths. Lacey et al.   2012   presented  a  Reputation-Based  Internet  Protocol  Security   RIPsec   framework  that  provides  security  for  MANET  in  terms  of  encryption,  IPsec transport mode, behavior grading, and multipath routing at mul- tiple  levels.  It  protects  MANET  from  external  threats  using  encrypted  links  and  encryption-wrapped  nodes  and  from  internal  threats  using  behavior grading to define the node’s reputation based on their demon- strated participation in the routing process. Pai and Wu  2011  designed  an  encryption-based method to nullify wormhole attacks that can seri- ously impair the routing protocols in MANET used by e-commerce. This  method  can  detect  the  attack  coming  from  both  outside  unauthorized  intruders  and  inside  authorized  attackers.  Third,  strong  authentication  schemes  are  implemented  to  meet  the  requirements  of  MANET  due  to  its  dynamic  topology  and  vulnerable  structure  for  attack.  In  MANET,  some  server  nodes  can  join  together  to  provide  mutual  authentication  based on the message exchange mechanism. Some service providers are  implementing this solution on the mobile devices, which do not require  password table stored in the server nodes. This approach can prevent the  off-line guessing attacks in the case of compromised node. Others use the  public key certificates management procedure between mobile agent and  broker  in  the  e-commerce  transition.  For  example,  Esparza  et  al.   2006   described  how  to  use  watermarking  techniques  to  detect  manipulation  attacks  and  use  brokers  to  punish  the  malicious  hosts.  Liebeherr  and  Dong   2007   proposed  a  key  management  and  encryption  scheme  for  application layer of MANET in which each node can share secrets with  the authenticated neighbor nodes to avoid the global rekeying operation.  Workman et al.  2008  developed a socio-biologically inspired approach  on enforcing security among mobile agents based on structuration theory.  Feng et al.  2009  discussed a security bootstrap model of key presharing  mechanisms in MANET using one-way hash functions to prevent the key  from being exposed. This mechanism is effective in detecting and block- ing the DoS attack and other malicious attacks.  To prevent various attacks on MANET, IDS is extremely effective to  both internal and external attacks. However, MANET offers a challenging  environment for conventional IDS. It is important to execute the mission  at an optimal rate for energy conservation. Jin-Hee et al.  2010  proposed  models on Stochastic Petri nets to figure out the optimal rates, which are  determined by operational conditions, system failure definitions, attacker behav- iors,  and  IDS  techniques  used.  Chizari  et  al.   2012   discussed  their  newly  developed flooding algorithm, which is called energy efficient multi-point         Chapter three:  Critical infrastructure management  65  relay  EF-MPR , devised for effective message broadcasting in a network.  Based on their extensive simulations, EF-MPR is proved to be effective in  reducing energy consumption, minimizing the number of packet collision  and  the  propagation  time.  In  particular,  MANET  has  a  dynamic  topol- ogy  with  issues  of  unreliable  connectivity,  limited  node  energy  supply,  and possibly high retention cost of nodes. To overcome these challenges,  researchers  have  developed  a  variety  of  agent-based  IDS.  Stafrace  and  Antonopoulos   2010   designed  a  framework  combining  a  military  com- mand structure and an agent behavioral model for IDS on MANET. The  framework can improve the effectiveness of the IDS without consuming  too much resource using a risk-based approach being directly proportional  to the risk factor of the route. The effectiveness of this approach is mea- sured through a simulation to detect and recover from a Sinkhole attack in  MANET, using the AODV as the routing protocol. The results are reported  in terms of the detection precision, data loss, and the communication over- heads. von Mulert et al.  2012  presented the Secure AODV SAODV proto- col using encryption mechanisms to protect the routing control messages  from the attacks such as medium access control layer misbehavior, resources  depletion,  black  holes,  wormholes,  jellyfish  and  rushing  attacks;  SAODV  pro- vides  a  number  of  security  schemes  such  as  multipath  routing,  incentive  schemes, directional antennae, packet leashes, randomized route requests, local- ized self-healing communities, and a reactive intrusion detection node blacklisting.  Venkatraman and Agrawal  2003  reported a study of AODV on the per- formance of the network with and without our secured routing scheme  based on the behavioral patterns of the nodes. They proposed authentica- tion techniques to isolate compromised nodes from MANET.  Researchers  and  application  developers  have  presented  a  variety  of solutions to improve the security and reliability on different layers  of network communication. For example, Itani and Kayssi  2004  pre- sented  a  security  solution  for  MANET  on  the  application  layer  using  pure  Java  component  independent  from  protocols  or  infrastructure,  and applied the solution to a mobile banking application. More recently,  Bar et al.  2013  presented a novel protocol in order to better cope with  black  hole  attacks.  In  their  proposed  protocol,  a  path  would  be  cho- sen if it involves a greater number of highest trusted nodes, which are  ranked by their packet forwarding capability. By doing this, paths with  low trust value will be disregarded and data will flow through more  secured routes; hence, the reliability of the whole network improved.  A similar approach is taken in Eissa et al.  2013  in which a trust-based  routing scheme named FrAODV is presented with abundant evidence  showing its effectiveness in improving MANET routing environment.  In  FrAODV  scheme,  a  route  is  evaluated  based  on  selected  features  such  as  trust  and  identity  of  the  involved  nodes  before  a  message  is forwarded.        66  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Liebeherr and Dong  2007  proposed a key management and encryp- tion scheme based on the application-layer overlay protocols to maintain  the  integrity  and  confidentiality  of  application  data  in  MANET.  The  method allows each node to share secrets only with authenticated neigh- bors  to  avoid  global  rekeying  operation  and  lower  the  risk  of  global  rekeying.  Komninos  et  al.   2006   discussed  the  solutions  of  multiple  lines  of  defense  from  both  data  link  and  network  layers  to  prevent  a  variety of attacks. Joshi  2011  identified a variety of attacks of MANET  in the network layers to understand how attacker absorbs network traf- fic and controls the network traffic flow. It is important to design new  protocol  not  only  to  establish  an  optimal  and  efficient  route  between  nodes, but also to prevent attackers from injecting themselves into the  unreliable  link  between  nodes.  However,  due  to  the  self-organizing,   self- configuring nature of MANET, the roles of nodes in MANET change  based on the type of the communication needs that create a dynamic and  decentralized structure for MANET infrastructure. Such nature creates  many challenges to the security and reliability of network infrastructure  in MANET.  3.6  Challenges and future research In MANET, mobile devices  nodes  are connected via wireless links. In  such network, nodes change locations very often thus posing special dif- ficulty for routing algorithm to address the changing topology. Given that   various protocols are available and every protocol is best for a particu- lar setting and makes it difficult to choose which protocol to use in the  application, it is critical to develop a set of framework to evaluate these  protocols in terms of security policy enforcement and efficient transmis- sion of data.  In  addition,  mobile  technology  allows  the  business  and  customers  to  connect  at  massive  scale  without  time  and  space  boundaries.  This  capability  of  mobile  commerce  will  have  impacts  on  the  way  business  happens, for example, mobile technology has already changed the cam- paign-based  consumer  marketing  strategy  to  the  dialogue-based  con- sumer marketing using social network and encourage consumer to share  information.  The  trusted  relationship  is  not  only  important  for  nodes  in MANET infrastructure in terms of security and reliability as we dis- cussed earlier, but also critical to the development of mobile commerce  applications between business and customers. The connection-oriented  nature of mobile communication helps to build a much deep trust chan- nel  than  other  connectionless  communication,  such  as  email  or  blog.  However, how to develop and maintain the trust in front of increasing  malicious attacks is a challenging task to the application developers and  service providers.

The entities can be a personal computer, mobile device,  etc. The aim of providing a topological structure to the network is to main- tain a path of communication and give direction peer-to-peer communi- cation. A network can be broadly classified as local area network  LAN ,  metropolitan area network  MAN , and wide area network  WAN .  LAN:  It  is  defined  as  a  network  wherein  computers  are  interconnected  within a limited area of about a kilometer. This limited area can be an  office, school, home, etc.  see Figure 4.1 .  MAN: It is defined as a network in which two or more devices or networks  are interconnected. The condition associated with this is that the commu- nicating devices or networks are geographically separated but exist in the  same metropolitan city. The metropolitan areas span over a geographical  area of about 50 km s   see Figure 4.2 .  WAN: It interconnects a number of LAN and MAN. The communication  over WAN can be over a public or private network  see Figure 4.3 .

In this configu- ration,  every  computer   node   shares  the  networks  total  bus  capacities.  In addition, adding more computers will reduce the access speed on the  network.  Each  computer  communicates  to  other  computers  on  the  net- work  independently.  This  is  referred  to  as  peer-to-peer  networking   see  Figure 4.4 .        Chapter four:  Security of wireless ad hoc network  75  Figure 4.1  Local area network.  LAN  Central NVR  MAN  Figure 4.2  Metropolitan area network.  Ring: In this topology, each node is connected to the two nearest nodes so  the entire network forms a circle. Data only travel in one direction on this  network. There is no central server in ring topology, and it works on the  basis of token methodology  see Figure 4.5 . Star: In this topology, every node is connected through a central device  such as a hub, switch, or router. Compared to ring and bus topologies, star  topology requires that more thought be put into its setup  see Figure 4.6 .        76  Mobile Electronic Commerce  LAN  LAN  Node  1  Node  3  LAN  WAN  LAN  Figure 4.3  Wide area network.

Tree: It is a variation of the bus topology. The shape of this type of net- work is that of a tree with central root branching and subbranching to the  extremities of the network. There is no need of removing packets from  the medium because when a signal reaches the end of the medium, it is  aborted by the terminators  see Figure 4.7 .  Mesh: Each node is connected to more than one node to provide an alter- native route in case the host is either down or too busy. This topology is  excellent for long-distance networking and is used in large internetwork- ing environments with stars, rings, and buses attached to each node  see  Figure 4.8 .

Wired networks can also be  used as part of other wired and wireless networks. Ethernet is the fast- est wired network protocol, with connection speeds from 10 megabits per  second  Mbps  to 100 Mbps or higher. Typically, the range of a wired net- work is within a radius of 2000 ft.  4.1.3.2  Wireless network  Wireless  network,  which  uses  high-frequency  radio  waves  rather  than  wires  to  communicate  between  nodes,  is  another  option  for  home  or  business networking. Individuals and organizations can use this option  to  expand  their  existing  wired  network  or  to  go  completely  wireless.  Wireless allows for devices to be shared without networking cable, which  increases mobility but decreases range. There are two main types of wire- less networking: peer to peer or ad hoc and infrastructure.  4.1.3.3  Ad hoc wireless network  Ad hoc or peer-to-peer wireless network consists of a number of  computers  each equipped with a wireless networking interface card. Each computer  can communicate directly with all the other wireless-enabled computers.  They can share files and printers this way but may not be able to access  wired  LAN  resources  unless  one  of  the  computers  acts  as  a  bridge  to  the wired LAN using special software. Mobile ad hoc networks  MANETs   are a kind of ad hoc wireless network that usually has a routable network- ing environment on top of a Link Layer ad hoc network  Hu et al., 2003 .        Chapter four:  Security of wireless ad hoc network  79  4.1.4  Comparing wireless network and wired network The  key  advantage  of  wireless  networks  over  wired  network  emerges  from  the  major  difference  between  the  two;  that  is,  one  uses  network  cables and the other uses radio frequencies  see Figure 4.9 .     Though wireless networking is a lot more mobile than wired net- working, the range of the network is usually 150–300 indoors and up  to 1000 ft outdoors depending on the terrain, but wired network is  much more secure than wireless network, and transmission speeds  can suffer from outside interference.     Wired networks are inexpensive compared with wireless network  installation, for wireless adapters and access points may cost three  or four times as much as Ethernet cable adapters and hubs switches.  Broadband routers cost more, but these are optional components of a  wired network, and their higher cost is offset by the benefit of easier  installation and built-in security features.     Wired  LANs  offer  superior  performance  compared  with  wire- less networks as it degrades because of distance sensitivity; that is,   maximum performance will degrade on computers farther away from  the  access  point  or  other.  A  traditional  wired  Ethernet   connection  offers only 10 Mbps bandwidth, but 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet technol- ogy costs a little more and is readily available. Fast Ethernet should  be sufficient for file sharing, gaming, and  high-speed Internet access.  But greater mobility of wireless LANs helps offset the performance  disadvantage.     Wireless LANs are less secure than wired LANs because wireless  communication  signals  travel  through  the  air  and  can  easily  be  intercepted. But wireless networks can be made as secure as wired  networks  are  for  the  ease  of  mobility;  that  is,  wireless  networks  protect  their  data  through  the  wired  equivalent  privacy   WEP   encryption.

These types are produced by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic  Engineers  IEEE   Hubaux et al., 2011 . These standards define all aspects  of radio frequency wireless networking. They have established four trans- mission standards: 802.11, 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g.  The basic differences between these four types are connection speed  and radio frequency. Transmission standards 802.11 and 802.11b are the  slowest at 1 or 2 Mbps and 5.5 and 11 Mbps, respectively. They both oper- ate  at  the  2.4  GHz  radio  frequency  range.  Standard  802.11a  operates  at  the 5 GHz frequency range and can transmit up to 54 Mbps, and 802.11g  operates at the 2.4 GHz frequency range and can transmit up to 54 Mbps.  Actual transmission speeds vary depending on such factors as the num- ber and size of physical barriers within the network and any interference  in the radio transmissions.  4.2  Security issues in wireless network In the arena of technical advancements, it is the need of the hour to ensure  safety and security of hardware, software, and data that are either present  on the computer entities or on the network.  The three key components of security can be defined as prevention,   detection, and reaction  Hu et al., 2003 .  Security  targets  the  features  of  integrity,  availability,  authenticity,   confidentiality, and nonrepudiation  Nogueira et al., 2009 , whereas safety  ensures  physical  safety  and  graceful  degradation  of  the  system.  These  security features are modeled to design the policies for information secu- rity  Yang et al., 2004 . Integrity: Integrity of information ensures that the information is accurate  and trustworthy. Availability: Availability ensures that the information is readily accessible  to the authorized people. Authenticity: Authenticity involves two parties: the sender and the receiver.  The sender should be genuine, and the receiver can authorized be only if it  is the intended receiver. For example, digital signature is one mechanism  to authenticate the user. Confidentiality: Confidentiality targets that the information is not disclosed  to unauthorized or unintended users. Nonrepudiation:  Nonrepudiation  means  that  neither  the  sender  nor  the  receiver can deny sending or receiving the information, respectively, at a  later stage.        Chapter four:  Security of wireless ad hoc network  81  4.2.1  Security issues  4.2.1.1  Lack of secure boundaries  Mobile  networks  are  generally  more  prone  to  physical  security  threats  than  are  fixed  cable  networks.  They  do  not  have  clear  defined  secure  boundaries that can be compared with the clear line of defense in the tra- ditional wired network. Mobile ad hoc networks face these threats due to  their nature of freedom to join, leave, and move inside the network. There  are increased possibilities of spoofing and denial-of-service  DoS  attacks  in these networks.  As in the mobile ad hoc network, there is no need for an adversary  to gain physical access to visit the network: once the adversary is in the  radio range of any other nodes in the mobile ad hoc network, it can com- municate with those nodes in its radio range and thus join the network  automatically. As a result, the mobile ad hoc network does not provide the  so-called secure boundary to protect the network from some potentially  dangerous network access.  4.2.1.2  Threats from compromised nodes inside the network  As there are no secure boundaries defined in a mobile ad hoc network,  it causes the occurrences of various link attacks. These link attacks place  their emphasis on the links between the nodes and try to perform some  malicious behavior to make destruction to the links. Due to some other  attacks, they try to gain the control over the nodes themselves by some  unrighteous means and then use the compromised nodes to execute fur- ther malicious action.  As nodes are free to leave and join, they do not have any strict polices  for themselves to prevent possible malicious behaviors from all the nodes  it  communicate  with  because  of  the  behavioral  diversity  of  different  nodes. The compromised node can frequently change their attack target;  thus, it is very difficult to track the malicious behavior of a compromised  node, especially in a large-scale ad hoc network. Therefore, threats from  compromised nodes inside the network are far more dangerous than the  attacks from outside the network, and these attacks are much harder to  detect because they come from compromised nodes, which behave well  before they are compromised.  4.2.1.3  Lack of centralized management facility  There is no centralized management system in mobile ad hoc networks  that  can  detect  the  attacks  and  can  control  the  incoming  and  outgoing  traffic because it is highly dynamic. In mobile ad hoc networks, the anom- alous failures like path breakages, transmission impairments, and packet  dropping happen frequently. Therefore, malicious failures will be more         82  Mobile Electronic Commerce  difficult to detect, especially when adversaries change their attack pattern  and their attack target at different periods of time.  Lack of centralized management machinery also affects trust man- agement for the nodes in the ad hoc network as all the nodes have to coop- erate for network operations so it becomes difficult to judge trusted and  nontrusted nodes.  The other important perspective on the lack of centralized manage- ment service is that some algorithms in the mobile ad hoc network rely on  the cooperative participation of all nodes and the infrastructure. Because  there is no centralized authority, and decision making in mobile ad hoc  network is sometimes decentralized, the adversary can make use of this  vulnerability  and  perform  some  attacks  that  can  break  the  cooperative  algorithm.  4.2.1.4  Restricted power supply  In mobile ad hoc networks, due to their mobility, it is common for nodes  to rely on batteries as their major source of power.  Due  to  this  limitation,  the  adversary  knows  that  the  target  node  is  battery-restricted; either it can continuously send additional packets to the  target and ask it to route those additional packets, or it can induce the tar- get to be trapped in some kind of time-consuming computations.  Sometimes, due to limitation, a node in the mobile ad hoc network  may behave in a selfish manner when it finds that there is only limited  power supply, and the selfishness can cause some problems when there  is a need for this node to cooperate with other nodes to support some  functions in the network. Some nodes may genuinely have exhausted  their power supply, but there can be some other node that intentionally  announces that it runs out of battery power and therefore do not want  to  cooperate  with  other  nodes  in  some  cooperative  operation  when  actually this node still has enough battery power to support the coop- erative operation.  4.2.1.5  Scalability  The term scalability in the mobile ad hoc network keeps on changing all  the time: because of the mobility of nodes in the mobile ad hoc network,  you can hardly predict how many nodes there will be in the network in  the future, due to which the routing protocols and key management ser- vices have to be made compatible with the continuous changing scale of  mobile ad hoc network as there are thousands of nodes participating in  the network  see Figure 4.10 .        Chapter four:  Security of wireless ad hoc network  83  Physical attack  Bombs, fire  Syntactic  Semantic attack  Virus, worms  Active attack  Passive attack  Figure 4.10  Types of attacks.  4.2.2  Types of attacks Attack can be categorized as internal and external. The other category in  which attacks can be placed is active and passive attacks. Viruses:  This  is  a  malicious  code  that  requires  that  you  perform  some  action before it infects your computer like opening an email attachment  or going to a particular web page  Nogueira et al., 2009 . Worms: Worms propagate without user intervention and start by exploiting  software vulnerability. Similar to viruses, worms can propagate via email,  websites, or network-based software. The automated  self-propagation of  worms distinguishes them from viruses  Nogueira et al., 2009 . Trojan horses: A Trojan horse program is software that does not let the user  know its actual consequences. For example, a program that claims it will  speed up your computer may actually be sending confidential informa- tion to a remote intruder  Nogueira et al., 2009 . Hacker, attacker, intruder: These terms are applied to the people who seek  to  exploit  weaknesses  in  software  and  computer  systems  for  their  own  gain. Although it is difficult to comment on one’s intention for doing this  because they may or may not cause direct harm to the end user, but DoS  definitely deprives the end user to be properly served  Lavania et al., 2011 . Eavesdropping: It is an unethical act of secretly capturing the exchange of  information between two ends without the knowledge of the sender and  the receiver. DoS: It is related to attacks against packet forwarding at network layer.  Such attacks do not disrupt the routing protocol and poison the routing         84  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Table 4.1  Attacks at Different Network Layers  Layer   Attack   Security measures   Application layer Virus, worms,   Transport layer  malicious codes Syn flooding  Network layer  Routing protocol  Detect and prevent application  level abuses Authenticate and secure  end-to-end communication Safeguard the routing and  forwarding protocols  Forwarding protocol Wormhole Blackhole Sinkhole Flooding Selective forward Rushing Sybil Exhaustion Collision Signal jamming  Data link layer  Physical layer  Protect wireless MAC layer  Avoid DoS attacks  states at each node. Instead, they cause data packets to be delivered in a  way that is intentionally inconsistent with the routing states. For exam- ple, the attacker along an established route may drop packets, modify the  content of the packets, or duplicate the packets it has already forwarded.  Another type of packet forwarding attack is the DoS attack via network- layer packet blasting, in which the attacker injects a large amount of junk  packets into the network. These packets waste a significant portion of the  network resources and introduce severe wireless channel contention and  network congestion  Table 4.1 .  4.2.3  Security issues in protocol stack  4.2.3.1  Measures  There are basically two approaches to protecting ad hoc networks: pro- active  and  reactive.  Proactive  approach  attempts  to  prevent  an  attacker  from launching attacks in the first place, typically through various cryp- tographic techniques  Hu et al., 2003 .  In contrast, reactive approach seeks to detect security threats a posteri- ori and react accordingly. Due to the absence of a clear line of defense, a com- plete security solution for such networks should integrate both approaches  and encompass all three components: prevention, detection, and reaction.  For  example,  proactive  approach  can  be  used  to  ensure  the  correctness         Chapter four:  Security of wireless ad hoc network  85  of  routing  states,  while  reactive  approach  can  be  used  to  protect  packet   forwarding operations. Through cryptography, information is protected by  converting it into an unreadable format  cipher text . Only those who pos- sess the secret key can decipher the message  Nogueira et al., 2009 . Based  on such network-layer vulnerabilities generally fall into one of two catego- ries—routing attacks and packet forwarding attacks—based on the target  operation  of  the  attacks   Lavania  et  al.,  2011 .  Some  of  the  cryptographic  algorithms are RSA, DES, and AES, which are quite popular.  By attacking the routing protocols, attackers can attract traffic toward  certain destinations in the nodes under their control and cause the pack- ets to be forwarded along a route that is not optimal or even nonexistent.  Attackers can create routing loops in the network and introduce severe  network  congestion  and  channel  contention  in  certain  areas.  Various  secure ad hoc routing protocols are source routing, distance vector routing,  and link state routing  Li and Joshi, 2008 .  4.2.3.2  Defense method against wormhole attacks  In wormhole attacks, an attacker records packets  or bits  at one location in  the network, tunnels them  possibly selectively  to another location, and  replays them there into the network. The replay of the information will  make an illusion, for the nodes that get the replayed packets cannot dis- tinguish them from the genuine routing packets. Due to this, the routing  functionality in the mobile ad hoc network will be severely interfered by  the wormhole attack  Lavania et al., 2011 .  Sunaina and Kumar  2013  have presented the mechanism to detect  and  to  defend  the  attacks  against  wormhole.  In  this  mechanism,  there  are two leashes  an additional information added to a packet designed to  restrict the packet’s maximum allowed transmission distance :  geographical  leashes and temporal leashes. A geographical leash ensures that the recipi- ent of the packet is within a certain distance from the sender. A temporal  leash ensures that the packet has an upper bound on its lifetime, which  restricts the maximum travel distance, since the packet can travel at most  at  the  speed  of  light.  Either  type  of  leashes  can  prevent  the  wormhole  attack because it allows the receiver of a packet to detect if the packet trav- els farther than the leash allows.  4.2.3.3  Watchdog and pathrater  Watchdog  and  pathrater,  as  the  names  themselves  suggest,  are  used  to  enhance the performance of wireless ad hoc networks in the presence of  disruptive nodes. The job of watchdog is to determine the misbehavior  of any node participating by copying packets to be forwarded into a buf- fer  and  monitoring  the  behavior  of  the  adjacent  node  to  these   packets.  Watchdog  snoops  to  decide  if  the  adjacent  node  forwards  the  pack- ets  without  modifications.  If  the  packets  that  are  snooped  match  with         86  Mobile Electronic Commerce  the observing node’s buffer, then they are discarded whereas packets that  stay in the buffer beyond a time-out period without any successful match  are flagged as having been dropped or modified. The node responsible for  forwarding the packet is then noted as being suspicious. If the number of  violations becomes greater than a certain predetermined threshold, the  violating node is marked as being malicious. Information about malicious  nodes is passed to the pathrater component for its corresponding job, that  is, performing path rating evaluation.  The role of pathrater is to rate the nodes indicated as violated nodes  by watchdog according to their reliability. Nodes are initially given a neu- tral rating, and the node if indicated by the watchdog as misbehaving is  given an immediate rating of −100. It is distinguished that misbehavior is  detected as packet mishandling modification, whereas unreliable behav- ior is detected as link breaks.

Social networking sites can also be  accessed via mobile phones as they are portable and integrate the social   89   90  Mobile Electronic Commerce  connections brought about by social networking services  SNSs  and the  communication  channel.  The  arrival  of  social  network  sites  is  rapidly  changing human interaction  Counts and Fisher, 2010; Zhong et al., 2011   that millions of people worldwide are living much of their lives on social  networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, and LinkedIn.  The number of Facebook users continues to increase globally and is  quickly becoming one of the most popular tools for social communication  and entertainment. It had 167,431,700 active users in the United States and  13,577,760 in Malaysia in 2013  Socialbakers, 2013 . More than 30 billion  pieces of content  web links, news stories, blog posts, notes, photo albums,  etc.  are shared each month. There are over 900 million objects that peo- ple interact with  pages, groups, events, and community pages . Facebook  introduced features such as wall, pokes, status, photos, news feed, tag,  marketplace,  instant  messaging,  and  video.  This  study  is  helpful  to  mobile  SNS  providers  as  it  discusses  the  effect  of  perceived  user  trust  and perceived flow experience on users’ loyalty toward their platform. If  the mobile SNS provider wishes to retain and increase their customers,  special attention will need to be paid toward the information and system  quality provided. Apart from that, the management teams of SNS such as  Facebook and Twitter will benefit from this study as well because they are  capable of altering and providing the perceived enjoyment to their users.  Hence, this study aims to examine the structural relationships of  1  per- ceived  information  quality  and  perceived  system  quality  on  perceived  user trust and perceived flow,  2  perceived user trust on perceived flow,  and  3  perceived user trust and perceived flow on mobile SNS users’ loy- alty simultaneously via structural equation modeling  SEM  approach.  This chapter is organized as follows. The next section review the liter- ature on perceived flow, perceived system quality, perceived information  quality,  and  perceived  user  trust  and  users’  loyalty  with  deriving  test- able  hypotheses.  Section  5.3  describes  the  research  methodology,  while  Section 5.4 reports the results of the study. The chapter rounds off with  conclusions and direction for future research.  5.2  Factors influencing users’ trust and loyalty This section described the variables that influence mobile SNS users’ trust  and loyalty, which includes perceived information quality, perceived sys- tem quality, and perceived flow.  5.2.1  Perceived information quality and perceived user trust Continuous exchange of information and access to, and understanding of,  information are necessary conditions for establishing a learning process.         Chapter five:  Mobile social networking service users’ trust and loyalty  91  Users  care  about  information  quality,  content  richness,  and  navigation   Ilsever et al., 2007 . Information quality is found to be an important trust- building mechanism  Fung and Lee, 1999; Keen et al., 2000 . Reliability,  relevance, and personalization of information exchange encourage the cre- ation of a trust-based relationship  Yvette and Karine, 2001 . Information  quality is also the antecedent of overall user satisfaction  Aggelidis and  Chatzoglou, 2012; Chang et al., 2012 , which influences the perceived value  of the e-commerce system  Wang, 2008 . Conversely, Zhou  2013  found an  insignificant relationship between information quality and user satisfac- tion. Therefore, it is hypothesized that  H1.  Perceived  information  quality  of  mobile  SNS  significantly  influ-  ences perceived user trust.  5.2.2  Perceived information quality and perceived flow Information quality presented on the Internet has a significant impact on  the  user  flow  experience   Chau  et  al.,  2000   in  terms  of  the  pleasure  in  using mobile SNS when conduct multiple tasks while surfing the Internet  to acquire information or entertaining themselves. For instance, users will  most  likely  form  negative  perceptions  about  the  information  quality  of  mobile SNS platform if the mobile service provider cannot provide accu- rate, comprehensive, and timely information to its users. Accordingly, it is  posited that  H2.  Perceived  information  quality  of  mobile  SNS  significantly  influ-  ences perceived flow.  5.2.3  Perceived system quality and perceived user trust System quality such as navigational structure and visual appeal influences  user trust in mobile commerce technologies  Vance et al., 2008 . Website qual- ity tends to be a stronger predictor of trusting beliefs  McKnight et al., 2002 .  For example, technical aspects of IT artifacts affect users’ willingness to trust   Gefen et al., 2006 . Prior studies found that system quality influences user  satisfaction  Aggelidis and Chatzoglou, 2012; Zhou, 2013  and perceived ease  of  use   Chen  and  Hsiao,  2012 .  Without  efficient  system  quality,  provision  of  quality  services  is  difficult,  which  in  turn  diminishes  flow  experiences   Aladwani and Palvia, 2002 . Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H3.  Perceived  system  quality  of  mobile  SNS  significantly  influences   perceived user trust.        92  Mobile Electronic Commerce  5.2.4  Perceived system quality and perceived flow System  quality  is  related  to  the  presence  of  a  fast,  reliable  connection  for navigation  Hsu and Lu, 2004; Nelson and Todd, 2005 . The interplay  of interactions between the system and the user, such as design factors  like  user  interface,  the  navigation  structure,  the  time  that  the  system  requires to process a request  Garrett, 2003; Chiou, 2005 , influences the  user’s cumulative satisfaction. Deighton and Grayson  1995  affirmed that  the flow generated during specific tasks at a website creates memorable  experiences that are believed to strengthen the relationship. The optimal  experience significantly influences the user’s intention to revisit a website.  Thus, the following hypothesis is posited:  H4.  Perceived  system  quality  of  mobile  SNS  significantly  influences   perceived flow.  5.2.5  Perceived user trust and perceived flow Trust, that is, belief that using mobile service will be free of security and  privacy threats  Doney and Cannon 1997; Wang et al., 2003 , will reduce  perceived uncertainty and risks, thus reducing the effort spent on monitor- ing the mobile service provider, subsequently enhancing users’ perceived  control  Pavlou et al., 2007 , and improving their experience. If users trust  mobile  service  providers,  they  expect  positive  future  experiences   Kim  et al., 2009 . Trust affects the online travel community users’ flow experi- ence  Wu and Chang, 2005 . Therefore, it is proposed that  H5. Perceived user trust significantly influences perceived flow.  5.2.6  Perceived user trust and loyalty Trust is one of the key factors when it comes to mobile success in com- merce,  as  when  customers  register  with  a  mobile  SNS,  they  are  giving  away private information or personal data. Trust has been shown to be a  key determinant of loyalty in offline and online environments  Berry and  Parasuraman, 1991 . For instance, m-loyalty was found to be influenced  by trust  Lin and Wang, 2006 . Norazah  2012  noted that customer trust  toward the vendor in m-commerce is affected by responsiveness, brand  image, and satisfaction toward the vendor in m-commerce. Further, trust  and  satisfaction  positively  influence  e-loyalty   Cyr  et  al.,  2006 .  Corbitt  et  al.   2003   noted  a  strong  positive  effect  on  trust  on  loyalty  to  online  firms. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that  H6. Perceived user trust significantly influences loyalty.        Chapter five:  Mobile social networking service users’ trust and loyalty  93  Perceived information  quality   Perceived  system quality  H1  H4  Perceived user  trust  Perceived ﬂow  H6  H7  H3  H2  H5  Loyalty  Figure 5.1  Theoretical framework.  5.2.7  Perceived flow and loyalty In a study, it is presented that the flow affects online consumers’ purchase  and  return  intention   Hausman  and  Siekpe,  2009;  Zhou  and  Lu,  2011 .  Users’  satisfaction  further  determines  their  continuous  use  of  mobile  Internet services  Deng et al., 2010 . User finds the flow experience in a  certain mobile SNS to be satisfying and will most likely continue using  it, which thus promotes loyalty. Understanding the influence of the flow  on the trusting belief–loyalty relationship can therefore ensure positive  loyalty outcomes  Gupta and Kabadayi, 2010 . Thus, it is posited that  H7. Perceived flow significantly influences loyalty.  Figure 5.1 illustrates the proposed theoretical framework based on the   aforementioned literature.  5.3  Methodology The  completed  and  usable  close-ended  questionnaire  was  circulated  to  200  university  students  studying  at  the  Universiti  Malaysia  Sabah  Labuan International Campus from January 26 to 28, 2011 utilizing the  convenience sampling technique as the method does allow the researcher  to  have  any  control  over  the  representativeness  of  the  sample.  Initially,  a total of 250 questionnaires were administered, leading to a response rate  of 80%. The students who have at least a social networking site account  such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, or LinkedIn and have experience in  browsing  it  via  mobile  phone  were  randomly  chosen  in  the  university  campus. The questionnaire comprised three sections. Section A consisted  of demographic profile of respondents. Section B consisted of questions  related  to  their  mobile  SNS  experience  in  terms  of  the  amount  of  time  mobile SNS is used in a week, mobile SNS usage, and the most frequently  visited mobile SNS. Section C examined the effect of flow experience on  mobile SNS users’ loyalty, which aimed to measure their perceived flow,   perceived  system  quality,  perceived  information  quality,  and  perceived         94  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Table 5.1  Measurement of Variables  Variables   Authors   Perceived information quality DeLone and McLean  1992  Perceived system quality  Perceived enjoyment Perceived control Attention focus  Perceived user trust Loyalty  Nelson and Todd  2005 ; Armstrong  and Hagel  1996 ; Chiou  2005  Davis et al.  1992 ; Koufaris  2002  Macan et al.  1990  Intriligator and Cavanagh  2001 ;  Pylyshyn and Storm  1988  Berry and Parasuraman   1991  Lin and Wang  2006 ; Cyr et al.  2006   user trust on mobile SNS users’ loyalty. The questionnaire items, as avail- able in Appendix 5.A, were adapted from sources as detailed in Table 5.1  and were measured on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1  strongly  disagree  to 5  strongly agree . SEM was utilized to empirically test and  estimate  the  hypothesized  relationships  by  using  the  AMOS  version  20.0  computer  software  as  it  has  the  ability  to  ensure  the  consistency  of  the  model  with  the  data  and  to  estimate  effects  among  constructs  instantaneously.  5.4  Data analysis Table  5.2  portrays  the  frequency  analysis  of  the  demographic  profile  of  respondents with 49% males and 51% females. More than three-quarter of  the respondents aged 21–25 years earn a monthly allowance of lesser than  RM300. In terms of mobile SNS experiences, 18% of the sample group use  mobile SNS for more than 15 times in a week. More than one-quarter of  the respondents have the experience of using mobile SNS for a period of  more than 6 months. Facebook is the most frequently visited mobile SNS  as compared with Twitter and MySpace.  5.4.1  Factor analysis Perceived flow, which combined three dimensions, perceived enjoyment,  perceived control, and attention focus, was developed via factor analysis  using varimax rotation. These dimensions are interchangeable, are sig- nificantly correlated among each other  Koufaris, 2002; Huang, 2006 , are  driven by the same underlying construct as it has the same determinants  and  consequences  that  reflected  perceived  flow   Siekpe,  2005;  Wang  et al., 2007 . Table 5.3 exemplifies that item loadings ranging from 0.685         Chapter five:  Mobile social networking service users’ trust and loyalty  95  Table 5.2  Socio-Demographic Profile of Respondents  Frequency   Percentage   Gender Male Female Age  years   <20  21–25 26–30  >31  Monthly allowance  <RM 300  RM 301–RM 400 RM 401–RM 500  >RM 501  Amount of time mobile SNS is used in a week  >15 times  1–5 times 6–10 times 11–15 times  125 32 7 36 Experience of mobile SNS usage 97 34 14 55  0–2 months 2–4 months 4–6 months  >6 months  Most frequently visited mobile SNS  Facebook MySpace Twitter MSN Yahoo messenger Others  98 102  26 168 4 2  160 13 7 20  147 2 5 9 10 27  49.0 51.0  13.0 84.0 2.0 1.0  80.0 6.5 3.5 10.0  62.5 16.0 3.5 18.0  48.5 17.0 7.0 27.5  73.5 1.0 2.5 4.5 5.0 13.5  to 0.848 with the item “I felt that using this mobile SNS is  interesting” has  a relatively highest loading on perceived flow with  Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin  Measure of Sampling Adequacy value of 0.896. Results have suppressed  small  coefficients  of  absolute  value  below  0.50  for  item  “when  using  this mobile SNS, I felt confused” was deleted as it does not meeting this  requirement.        96  Items   Mobile Electronic Commerce  Table 5.3  Factor Analysis  Perceived flow   I felt that using this mobile SNS is interesting I felt that using this mobile SNS is enjoyable I felt that using this mobile SNS is exciting When using this mobile SNS, I was intensely absorbed in the  activity I felt that using this mobile SNS is fun When using this mobile SNS, I concentrated fully on the activity When using this mobile SNS, my intention was focused on the  activity When using this mobile SNS, I felt calm When using this mobile SNS, I was deeply engrossed in the  activity When using this mobile SNS, I felt in control Total variance explained Percentage of variance explained Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy  0.848 0.841 0.822 0.815  0.810 0.782 0.781  0.721 0.719  0.685 6.275 57.043 0.896  5.4.2  Structural equation modeling SEM is performed via two-step SEM approach: measurement model and  structural model.  5.4.2.1  Measurement model  The measurement model was checked by inspecting item loading, construct  reliability, and average variance extracted  AVE  as summarized in Table 5.4.  The Cronbach’s alpha values and composite reliability values of all variables  exceeded the acceptable level of 0.70, implying all variables are reliable and  have high internal consistency. Moreover, each of the standardized loading  items is greater than 0.50 on their expected factor, except PC2, PC3, AF4,  indicating that the construct validity is acceptable. Convergent validity is  also acceptable as all AVE values are greater than the cut-off value 0.50.  Discriminant  validity  is  examined  by  comparing  the  shared  vari- ances between factors with the squared root of AVE for each construct.  The results in Table 5.5 show that the shared variances of the construct  with  other  constructs  were  lower  than  the  squared  root  of  AVE  of  the  individual  factors,  confirming  discriminant  validity.  Hence,  each  con- struct was statistically different from the others. Correlations between the  variables are positively significant at 0.01 level and finds that all of them  correlate. Next, the perceived flow had the highest mean of 4.608 whereas  the loyalty had the highest standard deviation of 1.459.

The measure of the fit of the tested model was  done through examining several goodness-of-fit indices  Table 5.6 . The  results indicated that the χ2 of the model was 493.859 with 187 degrees  of freedom  χ2 df = 2.641 . The fit indices value for comparative fit index   CFI , goodness of fit index  GFI , and normed fit index  NFI  were above  0.90 and root mean square error of approximation  RMSEA  below 0.08,  indicating a satisfactory fit.        98  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Table 5.5  Inter-Construct Correlations  2   3   4   5   1   0.854  0.756 **   0.792  0.564 **  0.625 **   0.750 **  0.608 **   0.775 0.643 **   0.768  0.628 **  4.465 1.250 −0.483 0.357  0.705 **  4.580 1.175 −0.591 0.761  0.701 **  4.608 1.382 −0.339 0.023  0.662 **  4.287 1.147 −0.219 0.846  0.858 4.430 1.459 −0.463 0.047  1.

There is 76% variance in mobile SNS users’ loyalty explained by perceived  user trust and perceived flow  R2 = 0.759 . Overall, the results signify a  sign of adequate model fit between the proposed research model and the  empirical data.  The  standardized  path  coefficients  for  the  hypotheses  testing  are  summarized in Table 5.7 and Figure 5.2, implying all hypothesized paths  were  significant  at  p  <  0.05.  Specifically,  perceived  information  quality   β1  =  0.507,  p  <  0.05   and  perceived  system  quality   β3 =  0.424,  p  <  0.05   significantly  influence  perceived  users  trust,  supporting  H1  and  H3.  Next, perceived flow is also significantly influenced by perceived infor- mation quality and perceived system quality of mobile SNS  β2 = −0.141;  β4 = 0.685, p < 0.05 . Thus, H2 and H4 are sustained. Likewise, significant  relationship  appears  between  perceived  user  trust  and  perceived  flow   β5 = 0.338, p < 0.05 , supporting H5.

Empirical  results provide information necessary to investigate the study hypoth- eses. Each standardized path coefficients within the model was assessed  as significant at the 0.05 level, and the overall model was determined to  fit  the  data  well.  Perceived  information  quality  highly  influences  per- ceived  user  trust  followed  by  perceived  system  quality,  satisfying  H1  and H3. This result is comparable to Wong and Hsu  2008 , which notes  that the quality of the information posted on the company website or  mobile  portal  has  a  direct  impact  on  potential  customers’  perception  and  trust  of  its  products  and  services.  Sledgianowski  and  Kulviwat   2009  and Davis  1989  found that the user’s thinking as to the useful- ness  of  a  system  has  a  great  influence  and  is  positively  related  to  the  adoption of information technology, thereby developing higher trust in  the mobile SNS platform.  Perceived  flow  is  significantly  influenced  by  perceived  information  quality  and  perceived  system  quality  of  mobile  SNS;  thus,  H2  and  H4         Chapter five:  Mobile social networking service users’ trust and loyalty  101  are supported. The preceding research  Pilke, 2004  found that informa- tive and pleasant visualization was quite frequently mentioned by partici- pants as an element that facilitates the flow. If the information provided  via the mobile SNS is accurate and is of high quality, users will have a bet- ter perceived flow. Zhou et al.  2010  noted that mobile SNS platforms that  are  unreliable  and  have  slow  responses  or  where  services  are  abruptly  interrupted will seriously affect users’ experience, including enjoyment,  attention focus, and control, which are the three reflective dimensions of  the  flow.  Further  investigation  of  the  study  found  that  H5  is  sustained  when  users  trust  the  mobile  SNS  provider  and  have  a  better  perceived  flow compared with those in doubt. Users reported that being confident  was important and stressed the value of being able to explore new things  in the online environment  Hassanein and Head, 2007 .  Corresponding  to  H6,  Gupta  and  Kabadayi   2010   found  that  trust  beliefs  affect  users’  loyalty  toward  websites.  Thus,  it  can  be  said  that  a  high perceived user trust in a certain mobile SNS platform will ensure cus- tomer loyalty. Compared with the effect of perceived user trust, perceived  flow has a larger effect, indicating perceived flow as the strongest determi- nant of users’ loyalty. Parallel to the significant finding for H7, Palka et al.   2009   stated  that  providing  users  with  a  good  experience  will  promote  their continuous use and generate positive word-of-mouth. Kim and Son   2009  revealed the significant effect of net benefits, including perceived  usefulness and satisfaction, on user loyalty toward online services. Also,  as proposed by Zhou et al.  2010 , improving user experience is one of the  main ways to enhance the user’s loyalty toward mobile SNS. Consequently,  if a user finds that the perceived flow from a mobile SNS provider above  satisfactory, there are high possibilities that the user will stay loyal.  5.6  Conclusion and perspectives Empirical  results,  via  SEM,  revealed  that  both  perceived  information  quality and perceived system quality affect perceived flow and perceived  user trust, which further influences mobile SNS users’ loyalty. Perceived  user trust affects perceived flow, and both factors influence user loyalty.  Indeed,  perceived  flow  is  regarded  as  the  strongest  factor  that  signifi- cantly affects users’ loyalty on mobile SNS. Mobile SNS providers need  to consider user perceived flow to enhance users’ loyalty. Thus, mobile  SNS providers should implement steps to increase perceived information  quality and perceived system quality in order to build and enhance users’  trust level and further provide users with a compelling experience. They  may need to emphasize loyalty program in an attempt to retain customers  in the competitive telecommunication market.  Further research is deemed essential to expand the sample size and  investigate  at  different  geographical  locations  by  considering  several         102  Mobile Electronic Commerce  social groups beyond Malaysia, such as other Asian countries, Europe,  and the United States to improve the generalizability of findings as most  of the current samples are students from the very same university and  the  studies  lean  more  toward  students  and  not  the  general  public  or  adults,  as  different  groups  of  working  professionals  would  use  mobile  SNS differently that introduces a big bias. However, this research pro- vides important theoretical contributions as most existing studies only  addressed  the  concern  of  user  acceptance  of  online  social  networking  sites  utilizing  the  theory  of  technology  acceptance  model.  This  study  adopts a comprehensive approach to explain structural relationships of  perceived flow, perceived system quality, perceived information quality,  and perceived user trust with mobile SNS users’ loyalty. In addition, the  research model supports the integration of cross-disciplinary studies in  virtual community research.  On the practical side, the results provide some tangible recommenda- tions for helping enhance their SNS users’ loyalty, thereby bringing con- tinued profitability and business success. It is also important for policy  makers to make efforts to outline strategies through its white papers to  encourage the use of social networking sites as an avenue to strengthen  business activities more competitively by emphasizing the aspects of per- ceived information quality, perceived system quality, perceived flow, and  perceived user trust on mobile SNS users’ loyalty.  5.A  Appendix Measurement of Instruments Perceived Information Quality  The information provided by this mobile SNS is what I need.

The widespread use of personal computers and the  introduction  of  high-speed  Internet  connectivity  made  the  process  of  sharing  business  information,  maintaining  business  relationships,  and  conducting  business  transactions  by  means  of  telecommunications  net- works a reality. Since the 1990s, a new type of electronic commerce con- ducted through handheld devices has been rapidly gaining momentum,  mostly due to developments in communication technologies and porta- ble computing. This subset of e-commerce, labeled mobile commerce, is  attracting significant attention and is shifting the way we conduct busi- ness from a wired to a wireless environment, using simply our handheld   107   108  Mobile Electronic Commerce  terminals anytime and anywhere  Ngai and Gunasekaran 2005 . Due to  its characteristics  among others ubiquity, personalization, and flexibility ,  mobile commerce promises businesses unprecedented market potential,  great productivity, and high profitability  Siau et al. 2003 . The number of  mobile phone users is rising continuously as the market of mobile tech- nologies  is  promising  speed  and  convenience.  Currently,  an  overall  of  10% of global website views are from mobile devices  smartphones and   tablets . On Christmas day 2012, more than 50% of online activity came  from  mobile  devices   Mixpanel  2012 .  Mobile  technology  in  Japan  cur- rently accounts for 35% of all e-commerce transactions. In 5 years’ time,  more than 50% of all transactions will be through smartphones  IPC 2012 . Various  kinds  of  mobile  applications  have  emerged  as  a  result  of  these advances and are penetrating our everyday life, changing human  behaviors,  and  generating  important  social  and  economic  impacts   Xu  et al. 2008 . Among these efforts, mobile applications for shopping come  at  the  intersection  of  ubiquitous  computing  and  electronic  commerce  and are gaining attention from both communities  Xu et al. 2008 . Prior  work though has mostly focused on the transactional functions of mobile  phones and information consumption on-the-go and less on the experi- ential aspect of shopping and how this can be improved via the use of  wireless devices  Xu et al. 2008 . Nowadays, there is a fundamental blur- ring of the boundaries between online and off-line shopping  Gish 2012 .  Smartphones  are  fundamentally  changing  how  people  shop,  browse,  use  coupons,  find  locations,  and  enter  local  and  near  field  promotions.  Shopping behavior is changing and showrooming and snacking  shop- ping in a spare five minutes  are increasing  Gish 2012 . The real and the  virtual world are converging into a complete shopping experience. It is  becoming typical user behavior for consumers when in stores to go for  their handheld devices in search of additional product information, bet- ter prices, and location information in an attempt to speed up the overall  shopping process and gain a better shopping experience.  Channels are blending and consumers are shopping wherever, when- ever, and however they want. According to Forrester, 50% of retail sales  are influenced online  IPC 2012 . As part of its “Mobile path to Purchase”  research, Nielsen and Telmetrics reported that a 46% of mobile users rely  exclusively  on  their  mobile  device  for  retail  prepurchases  in  the  stores  while, interestingly, half of the audience does not need to do a PC research  before buying  Sterling 2013 .  However, current retailers do not seem to be tuning successfully into  this new trend. While in wired settings, we have accumulated the neces- sary  knowledge  to  design  and  develop  commercial  systems  effectively,  the field of m-commerce presents not only unique opportunities but also  challenges.  It  faces  a  number  of  businesses,  technical,  and  legal  chal- lenges that differ from traditional e-commerce, specifically in relation to         Chapter six:  Comparative study of in-store mobile commerce applications  109  location-based services  Tsalgatidou et al. 2000 . A thorough analysis of  the design space of in-store shopping is a necessity, in addition to the way  that mobile device interaction can get embedded in the shopping expe- rience in benefit of the customer  Xu et al. 2008 . Moreover, factors that  influence actual adoption of mobile shopping applications, such as value  creation, user acceptance, and entertainment, must be examined in detail,  so that we gain an understanding of the mobile customer’s requirements. In this chapter, we focus on the type of mobile commercial applications  that consumers use when shopping in large retail stores or shopping malls, so  as to speed up the shopping process and gain an ideal shopping experience.  More specifically, we are concerned with the nontransactional functions of  commercial applications that can offer convenience and fun during the shop- ping process. The chapter is structured as follows: we first attempt to define  the boundaries of our research by accurately defining the problem space,  evaluating not only the benefits and detriments but also the inherent com- plexities of designing and developing such applications. Within this scope,  we perform a literature review with the purpose of eliciting requirements  for m-commerce applications. Requirements elicitation is recognized as one  of the most critical, knowledge-intensive activities of software development;  poor execution of elicitation will almost guarantee that the final project is a  complete failure  Gottesdeiner 2002, Hickey and Davis 2003 . The process  of requirements capturing can be broken down into discovery  elicitation ,  analysis,  modeling  and  documentation,  communication,  and  validation   Schedlbauer 2011 . The volatile nature of m-commerce requires we perform  a validation of collected requirements; we employ methods such as inter- views,  surveys,  and  on-site  interaction  to  effectively  validate  the  require- ment set. Additionally, we perform a comparative study of available in-store  commercial applications in a contextual setting, with classification based on  user acceptance, in an attempt to identify the characteristics and design fea- tures of such an application. From these, a design framework stems, with  guidelines and recommendations of considerations that can assist designers  and developers of mobile on-site shopping applications with the ultimate  goal of designing a better overall shopping experience.  6.2  Mobile commerce in the shopping field Mobile electronic commerce  Tsalgatidou et al. 2000  has recently emerged  as a subset of e-commerce and refers to those  activities that  rely solely  or partially on mobile e-commerce transactions. It operates in a different  environment than e-commerce, which can be viewed as conducted in the  fixed desktop Internet metaphor, mostly due to the different characteris- tics and constraints of mobile devices, constraints of wireless networks,  and ultimately the context, situations, and circumstances in which people  use their handheld terminals.        110  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Advances in telecommunication of the last decade have made mobile  commerce one of the main channels for purchasing products. Its features,  such as ubiquity, reachability, localization, and dissemination  Siau et al.  2003 , combined with the recent advanced capabilities of mobile devices  have provided the consumer with a great device for decision making. Due  to this, we are witnessing a shift from electronic shopping and in-store  shopping to a crossbred shopping experience that includes in-store shop- ping using a mobile device for every step of the shopping process.  Shopping  behavior  is  changing.  Channels  are  blending  and  con- sumers are shopping wherever, whenever, and however they want  Gish  2012 .  According  to  Forrester,  50%  of  retail  sales  are  influenced  online   IPC 2012 . The consumer has found in m-commerce a better way for con- ducting shopping on the go in a more convenient, time saving, and plea- surable way, while simultaneously benefiting from a more personalized  service. But mobile commerce benefits are not strictly consumer driven.  Businesses can increase their market potential, productivity, and profits,  through managing smartly this upward trend  Siau et al. 2003 . Retailers  now  have  the  chance  to  influence  consumers  in  a  more  direct  way,  by  identifying the mobile shopping space and adjusting their services to it.  By exploiting mobile commerce capabilities, they are able to track their  customer’s location and promote special discounts, e-coupons, and mes- sages, identify their special needs and inform about desired products, and  direct them inside the store till the point of purchase.  Despite the benefits of mobile commerce for consumers and retailers,  there are many constraints induced by the characteristics of wireless com- munications, the devices, and the context of mobility itself  Tsalgatidou  et  al.  2000 .  Wireless  communication  constraints  are  attributed  to  the  quality of service of the networking infrastructure consisting of various  wireless networks  LAN, WAN, satellite services, etc.  and other protocols,  standards, and technologies. This complex networking system is respon- sible for the efficiency of mobile commerce activities and must be taken  into  account  when  designing  an  m-commerce  system  so  that  problems  such as frequent disconnection, loss of data, slow download rate, and oth- ers are eliminated.  The  design  and  development  of  mobile  applications  is  highly  com- plex  and  challenging   Charland  and  Leroux  2011 .  It  concerns  develop- ing for a number of different operating systems and devices with various  characteristics in a diverse set of programming languages. In such a frag- mented field, designers and developers have to comprehend the restric- tions  of  the  technology   e.g.,  small  screen,  memory,  and  CPU   and  the  particular technical characteristics of mobile operating systems  e.g., iOS,  Android, and Windows phone   Forman 1998 . In addition, mobile devices  are  characterized  by  a  unique  synthesis  of  interaction  affordances  that  can  actually  transform  the  user  experience  when  compared  to  desktop         Chapter six:  Comparative study of in-store mobile commerce applications  111  platforms  including  gesture-based,  multitouch  interaction  with  digital  content; location awareness and subsequent service and content adapta- tion; advanced sensing capabilities  with embedded devices such as accel- erometer, gyroscope, GPS, and camera ; multimedia  photos, sound, and  video  capturing and sharing  Corey 2010, Reddy et al. 2010, Ferreira et al.  2012 .  Therefore,  mobile  application  development  requires  a  whole  new  way  of  thinking  in  respect  to  interaction  design  and  HCI  as  well  as  to  software development. Device constraints are enhanced mostly due to the  nature of the devices themselves, especially their portability. To be easily  carried around, mobile devices are light and small. As a result, they have  smaller screens, keypads, memory, disk capacity, and processing power,  combined with high power consumption. Mobility constraints are related  to  the  continuous  switch  of  locations  of  a  mobile  user  and  the  various  scales of bandwidth networks he she may connect from. User device loca- tion  tracking  can  often  be  interrupted  because  of  often  movement  and  unavailability  of  networks.  Mobility  also  raises  complex  security  and  authentication issues  Tsalgatidou et al. 2000 .  In mobile commerce, we also identify several requirements that are  not available to traditional electronic commerce and that should be con- sidered  in  the  development  of  m-commerce  systems  and  applications.  Influenced  by  Varshney  and  Vetter’s   2002   proposed  framework  for  mobile commerce application implementation, we identified three impor- tant  areas  of  interest  for  m-commerce  applications  from  which  several  requirements derive. Those are as follows:          1. Software  mobile interface and mobile middleware  2. Hardware   mobile  handheld  devices  such  as  PDAs  and  mobile   smartphones   3. Wireless network  wireless mobile network infrastructure   We developed a diagram that summarizes the most significant require- ments  and  constraints  resulting  from  each  one  of  the  aforementioned  areas   Figure  6.1 .  Software  requirements  can  be  classified   ISO IEC  JTC1 SC7  N4098   according  to  the  assigned  and  inherent   existing  or  permanent characteristics or features  properties of a software product.  Moreover, inherent properties can be classified as either functional prop- erties  or  quality  properties.  Functional  properties  determine  what  the  software  is  capable  of.  In  our  case,  these  domain-specific  functional  properties  include  basically  the  functions  of  a  mobile  commerce  sys- tem  that  we  want  to  examine   e.g.,  locating  an  item  and  searching  for  prices . Quality properties determine how well the software performs.  In  other  words,  quality  properties  indicate  the  degree  to  which  the  software  is  capable  of  providing  and  maintaining  specified  services.  Hardware  requirements  derive  from  the  nature  of  mobile  devices  and         112  Mobile Electronic Commerce  M-commerce requirements  Hardware requirements  Software requirements  Networking requirements  Stability Compatibility  interface design according to size  Minimize memory load Minimize processing power Minimize power consumption  Inherent properties  Quality of service Network dependability Location management support Multitask support Roaming across multiple wireless networks  Assigned properties  Quality requirements  Domain-specific functional requirements  Price Delivery date Product future Product supplier Other managerial requirements  Functional suitability Reliability Performance efficiency Operability Security Compatibility Maintainability Transferability  Location tracking In-store navigation system Product code scanning Product information allowance Product price and feature comparison Discount detection Stock availability detection Shopping list creation and management Total cost estimating Checkout method  Figure 6.1  Mobile commerce requirements.  their  capabilities.  Networking  properties  refer  basically  to  constraints  and challenges related to connectivity and bandwidth issues  Varshney  and  Vetter  2002 .  Varshney  and  Vetter   2002   categorized  networking  requirements for m-commerce applications into five groups, such as loca- tion management, multitasking support, network dependability, quality  of service, and roaming across multiple networks.  A number of classes of m-commerce applications can be identified,  including mobile financial applications, mobile advertising, mobile inven- tory management, product locating and shopping, proactive service man- agement,  wireless  reengineering,  mobile  auctions  or  reverse  auctions,  mobile entertainment services and games, mobile offices, mobile distance  education, and wireless data centers.  In our research, we focus on “product locating and shopping” class,  which  includes  applications  that  locate  an  item  in  a  particular  area  or  location.  This  also  concerns  finding  an  item  with  certain  specifica- tions  and  its  availability  across  stores   Varshney  and  Vetter  2002 .  Although m-commerce activities include trading of goods and services  of  economic value, this is not strictly limiting; thus, our research does  not deal with the transactional aspect of mobile shopping. We are more  concerned with the experiential aspect of shopping via handheld mobile  devices aiming at simplifying several consumers’ tasks. Within this con- text,  we  attempt  to  identify  the  set  of  requirements,  which  should  be  met  when  designing  an  m-commerce  application;  this  set  will  lead  to  the specific  design  principles of an m-commerce application targeting  at improving the shopping experience. In the related literature review  step, we attempt to specific design requirements related to our class of  applications.        Chapter six:  Comparative study of in-store mobile commerce applications  113  6.3  Consumer behavior Today’s shoppers generally find the shopping experience at existing retail  stores satisfying on the dimensions of convenience, product quality, value  provided, and product selection. However, they express their dissatisfac- tion with the speed of shopping, level of service, available product infor- mation,  fun  of  shopping,  and  security  and  privacy   Burke  2002 .  In  the  last decade, technology has appeared as a viable solution to many of the  previous requirements. Mobile phones tend to become a growing shop- ping channel, filling in gaps in the shopping experience, while providing  a better, more convenient, and efficient overall way to shop.  Currently, consumers search several stores to find an item of a certain  brand, size, and characteristics to fit their preferences, required features,  and price. Using a handheld device and an online product information  service, a user is capable of navigating to the exact location of a store or a  certain product  Varshney and Vetter 2002 . In the case of large shopping  stores and malls, consumers attempt to use their mobile devices in store,  to speed up the shopping process  using indoor maps for tracking and  navigating  so as to gain a pleasant, convenient, and efficient visit in the  shop and even avoid staff’s sales pressure.  Chuck Martin, the CEO of Mobile Future Institute, stated recently that  mobile is turning “path to purchase on its head”  2013 . Shopping is becom- ing an iterative rather than a serial process. Consumers no longer go shop- ping, they always are shopping, he continues. Hackbert  2012  indicates that  the phenomenon is growing especially among smartphone users, which  he calls app-happy. In his research, he found that 56% of smartphone own- ers have at least one shopping-related app installed on their phones and  15% have more than six shopping apps currently on their phones.  6.4  Choice of comparative study and environment In order to create a useful design framework for mobile in-store shopping  applications we conducted a three-level study, consisting of a literature  review, an online survey, and an on-site comparative study. The research  is organized as follows:  First, we perform an extended literature review with the purpose of  eliciting requirements for m-commerce applications. Requirements elici- tation is recognized as one of the most critical, knowledge-intensive activ- ities  of  software  development;  poor  execution  of  elicitation  will  almost  guarantee that the final project is a complete failure  Gottesdeiner 2002,  Hickey and Davis 2003 . The process of requirements can be broken down  into discovery  elicitation , analysis, modeling and documentation, com- munication,  and  validation   Schedlbauer  2011 .  The  volatile  nature  of  m-commerce requires we perform a validation of collected requirements.        114  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Second, we employ methods such as interviews, surveys, and on-site  interactions  with  customers  to  effectively  validate  the  requirement  set.  We conducted an online survey audience so as to confirm which of the  requirements identified earlier were actual consumer needs or could be  considered as constraints and identify new ones.  The third part of our work included the comparison of several features  in existing mobile applications as well as the evaluation of the require- ments gathered in the second step in real-time conditions. To do this, we  chose an on-site field study so as to identify additional usability and inter- action issues as well as measure user satisfaction throughout the whole  shopping  process.  We  conducted  our  study  in  the  public  store  located  in the center of Athens, Greece. The store is structured as a large show- room with multiple floors organized by product category. Its purpose is  to encourage people to walk in, experience the various products, and ask  questions. We have chosen several existing mobile shopping applications  and an appropriate number of users that cover a range of ages and both  genders. These applications support in-store shopping activities such as:     Creating and managing shopping list    Checking product prices and discounts    Locating a product in nearby stores    Finding product information and customer reviews through scan-  ning  barcode, QR code, and image recognition      Comparing product features    Sharing a product with friends  Some of the applications contained transactional functions such as pur- chasing a product online or mobile payment via a credit card. However,  we  excluded  these  features  from  our  research  as  security  and  privacy  issues could be raised.  6.4.1  Requirements elicitation When designing mobile applications that contribute to the convenience  of  the  shopping  process  for  consumers,  there  are  a  number  of  specific  requirements  that  should  be  considered,  as  the  shopping  experience  is  related  to  meeting  specific  consumer’s  needs  and  pleasuring  the  cus- tomer. System and application design alike should be approached from  the point of entertainment service provision  Roussos et al. 2003 . Roussos  et al.  2003  examined this retailing entertainment or retailtainment aspect  of m-commerce by developing a grocery shopping system. In the first step  of  their  research,  they  collected  several  user  requirements  conducting  a field study of a target audience. The study revealed a number of user  required features, including features supporting a constant awareness of         Chapter six:  Comparative study of in-store mobile commerce applications  115  total shopping costs, access to complete and accurate product  descriptions,  comparison of value of similar products, personalized and targeted pro- motions, in-store navigation, and smart checkout. In the second stage of  their  research,  real-time  user  scenarios  were  conducted  so  as  to  evalu- ate the system. Participants claimed that using the system transformed  the shopping experience into a less stressing experience. However, sev- eral privacy constraints were identified. Participants were especially con- cerned about collection and storage of personal data, even though data  protection policies were confirmed.  When shopping in a large store, a shopping mall, or supermarket, user  requirements  are  amplified,  as  customers’  needs  grow.  Corresponding  applications are expected to provide additional functions that can trans- form  the  uncomfortable  and  often  disorienting  mall  experience  into  a  pleasant, convenient, and friendly visit. Some of these additional require- ments relate to features such as customer in store guidance and to-product  guidance. In this context, Asthana et al.  1994  developed a wireless per- sonal shopping assistant based on the capabilities of customers’ wireless  communication devices. In their work, they support that such a person- alized nature of service can add not only to customer’s convenience, but  could  also  be  a  source  of  direct  and  indirect  revenue  for  the  shopping  center. The system must be simple and help the customer navigate within  the store and inquire about items. In some cases, it may even track the  customers shopping history so as to provide relevant information to them.  Asthana et al., as did Roussos et al., identified several constraints that are  following the implementation of this system and its functions such as pri- vacy issues, or the size, weight, power consumption, and frequency band- width for the handheld device.  Xu et al.  2008  also tried to explore the experiential aspect of mobile  shopping in their design approach of a vision-based mobile interface for  in-store shopping. After conducting a 1-month long diary study, they for- mulated a list of design principles for mobile shopping applications. First,  they support that these applications should not demand a high and con- tinuous level of attention, so as not to interfere with the shopping experi- ence itself. Second, the portability of the mobile phone platform and its  connection to other resources need to support the shopping activity over  a longer term and across different locations. Moreover, mobile shopping  applications need to simplify access to product information  in compari- son to desktop usage  and provide highly relevant content in relation to  location, time, and personalization opportunities. Mobile shopping appli- cations also need to focus on supporting organizational and communica- tional functions, as these are considered important by consumers. Lastly,  they mention that online and in-store shopping experiences need to be  bridged as the user’s cognitive load of shopping tasks, when switching  from one context to the other, should be minimized. Interestingly, after         116  Mobile Electronic Commerce  examining  their  application  via  a  number  of  user  real-time   scenarios,  they also found that participants were more than  interested in  sharing  and saving functions such as “adding a product to a wish list” and “send  to a friend.”  Adelmann   2007 ,  in  his  study  on  mobile  phone  interactions  with  everyday  products,  claims  that  the  existence  of  a  good  middleware  is  the solution for a fast and convenient interaction between the handheld  devices and the products. He supports that “when being on the go, a sim- ple and fast user interaction is essential.” For succeeding in this, he states  that a good recognition rate must be provided by the application. Most of  the times, recognition conditions are bad because of limited lighting, low  camera resolution, possible hand movement when scanning, or even the  quality of the image. When in the shopping field, users have neither the  convenience to scan products appropriately so that the system will return  them  the  related  information  nor  the  time  to  manually  enter  data  into  their phone. As a result, a mobile shopping application should ease and  accelerate the interaction process, relying mostly on tag-based interaction  whenever possible and using good recognition algorithms that can cope  with complex lighting conditions  Adelmann 2007 .  In the related literature, less attention is paid to the role of aesthet- ics as being an influential factor in the use of mobile commerce applica- tions. Cyr et al.  2006  tried to explore the possibility of visual design  aesthetics  leading  to  mobile  loyalty  of  users.  They  discovered  that  an  aesthetic design could significantly impact perceived usefulness, ease  of use, and enjoyment all of which ultimately influence user’s loyalty  toward  a  mobile  service.  User  acceptance  of  new  and  well-designed  technologies  and  interface  is  crucial  to  the  adoption  of  mobile  com- merce systems.  Stemming from our review of relative articles, we made a list with  the specific design requirements for mobile shopping applications in the  following:     Should not demand a high, continuous level of attention    Should minimize cognitive load of shopping tasks    Have  simple  and  fast  interaction,  hands-free  operation,  minimize   data entry whenever possible     Have an aesthetically pleasing design    Support organizational and communicational functions  create lists,   sharing functions      Provide an accurate item recognition and interaction function    Calculate the total shopping cost constantly    Provide access to product information and descriptions    Locate a product’s specific position    Navigate the customer inside the store        Chapter six:  Comparative study of in-store mobile commerce applications  117     Compare the value of similar products    Provide personalized and targeted product promotions    Provide smart checkout method  Many  constraints  and  restrictions  identified  in  the  relative  research  were related not only to privacy and security issues, pointing to a lack,  but also to the necessity of trust between the customers and commercial  institutions. Additionally, issues that derive from the nature of handheld  devices and wireless communications were mentioned, such as the size,  weight,  power  consumption,  frequency  bandwidth,  coverage  area,  and  connectivity.  6.4.2  Communication and requirements validation We identified m-commerce requirements for shopping applications and  within this context we performed an investigation, using online question- naires and on-site interviews, to validate the requirements set and iden- tify any additional unique requirements. The methods selected for this  survey included user feature testing, questionnaires, and wrap-up inter- views with customers at a shopping mall in Athens, Greece.  The questionnaire comprising a total of 13 questions: the first 5 were  demographic, and the rest focused on requirement identification and vali- dation. We conducted our questionnaire online directed to 158 people of  ages between 10 and 70 years enquiring about their experience with wire- less  devices,  their  usage  of  electronic  or  mobile  commerce,  if  they  had  ever tried an m-commerce application while shopping in a store and what  exact functions they had used during their shopping trip. We also asked  participants to propose any features they believed would improve their  shopping experience and also to identify elements that could deter it.  A total number of 158 participants took part in this survey; they were  between 10 and 70 years of age: 66.46% of user between 16 and 24, 29.75% of  users were between 25 and 45, and 3.80% between 46 and 70. As expected, a  huge number of the audience  75.95%  were smartphone users and a 15.19%  also  used  tablet  devices   Figure  6.2 .  We  enquired  about  device  owner- ship and attempted to identify market fragmentation  Figures 6.3 and 6.4 .  It was interesting to see that even in a small fragment of the overall market,  device fragmentation percentages seem to be very close to other published  reports  Android as a market leader, followed by Apple and Windows .  To examine their history with electronic commerce we asked them if  they ever purchased an item from the Internet  Figure 6.5 . A large percent  responded  positively  as  having  shopped  occasionally  at  popular  com- mercial websites such as eBay.com  52.90% , Skroutz.gr  31.16% , Amazon. com and E-shop.gr  39.13% , and other.

We  then  asked  them  if  they  had  ever  used  a  mobile  shopping   application to simplify their shopping experience and if not what were the  reasons  Figure 6.7 . A 25.95% claimed to have used a shopping applica- tion while inside a store so as to compare prices or products with similar  features  65.96% , create a list with products  42.55% , calculate total shop- ping cost  27.66% , check product availability in the store’s stock  25.53% ,  find discounts  25.53% , and search for the same product in nearby stores   23.40%   Figure 6.8 . However, a large part of the audience that responded  negatively in the previous question claimed to often use the Internet to  research  certain  products  before  visiting  a  traditional  store  or  did  not  know that such was possible. Some of the respondents comments were  related  to  the  fact  that  most  of  these  applications  are  time  consuming  and can get frustrating due to continuous network disconnections; thus  prefer using a desktop or laptop before visiting a shop. Others of course   Have you ever used your mobile device  mobile smartphone, tablet, iPod, etc.    for electronic shopping?

A big drawback identified by a large number of users was  that many stores do not always provide free Internet access for customers. We  also  asked  the  audience  to  identify  which  feature  was  more  important for a mobile shopping application in their opinion  Figure 6.9 .  Functions such as comparing prices and product features, checking stock  availability,  searching  product  in  nearby  stores,  finding  discounts,  and  calculating total cost were most highly rated. Instead, interestingly, activi- ties  such  as  locating  a  product  and  navigating  in  the  store,  purchasing  a product and sharing product list purchase with friends, or creating a         Chapter six:  Comparative study of in-store mobile commerce applications  121  If you ever decided to use a mobile shopping application, which of the following  functions would you find useful to be provided while shopping?  80%  76.58%  100%  60%  40%  20%  0%  56.33%  53.8%  55.7%  26.58%  22.78%  34.81%  20.25%  21.52%  Compare product prices and  features  Track  product and  39;s location inside the store  Search for the same product in nearby stores  Check  product and  39;s  availability  in the  store and 3  9;s stock  Purchase product via an online credit card  account  Find  discounts  Calculate  total  shopping  cost  Provide a map of the store  Create and  manage a  shopping  list  Share a product  purchase  list with friends  Other  please specify ;  6.33%  3.16%  via  Facebook, Twitter, e-ma...

Some of the respondents  also  suggested  that  the  system  should  provide  customer  reviews  and  information about the country of origin, product guarantees, history of  purchases in that store, or even recommend to them related products that  can  be  used  in  the  same  way  with  the  one  they  are  searching  for.  It  is  interesting to view the differences between most used and required fea- tures for m-commerce in shop applications. Although comparing product  features remains the top choice in both occasions, finding discounts and  products in other stores are the second top required features.  Enquiring  about  what  features  customers  find  more  important  in  relation to mobile shopping, respondents preferred simple and easy inter- actions, accuracy and speed in results provided, good visual design, and  the elimination or automation of steps to result  provide a wide range of  search features, accept speech input instead of manual data entry, not to  surpass  four  steps  otherwise  it  gets  tiring .  They  also  found  important  not  having  to  download  another  application  so  that  the  first  will  be  in  the position to operate  this is often required by application using exter- nal libraries for QR code or other image recognition capabilities . Some  respondents commented that the application should be able to save their  preferences so that they do not need to repeat them next time and to use  their 3G connections wisely in case the store does not provide free WiFi.  We finally asked the audience what usually prevents them from using  a mobile application. Most of the respondents agreed that the time they  have to wait and the number of steps  interactions  required before getting         122  Mobile Electronic Commerce  to the necessary result is an important barrier when on the go, while the  price of an application  in case it is not available for free , the amount of  power  consumed,  screen  size,  keyboard  size,  and  security  and  privacy  issues remain important. A smaller percentage of responses referred to  issues such as limited network capabilities and frequent disconnections  or  the  frustration  caused  by  having  to  change  networks  when  moving  between locations. Some respondents added that the time spent, the com- plexity  of  such  systems,  and  the  memory  consumption  are  not  worth  using such applications most of the times.  Comparing the survey results with the requirements and constraints  gathered in the first stage of our study, we formulated a new list with the  most important functional, quality, and networking objectives of a mobile  shopping application system: Functional objectives:     Check product prices discounts    Find additional information about a product  characteristics, coun-     Compare  the  value  of  similar  products   provide  product  reviews   try of origin, and guarantees   and suggest similar products      Calculate the total shopping cost    Check the availability of a product in the store’s stock    Search for the same product in nearby stores    Locate a product in the store    Purchase a product  provide checkout method     Create and manage shopping list  create a list, save item to wish list   Quality objectives:  eliminate tasks  device  base search   operate     Simple  and  fast  interaction,  ease  of  use  and  search,  automate  or      Interface design compatible with the size and capabilities of wireless      Information accuracy  high recognition rate, broader database search     Speed in providing results  high recognition algorithm, quick data-     Should not demand the installation of another application so as to      Aesthetic interface design    Security and privacy of personal data    Minimize power consumption    Minimize memory consumption    Support organizational and communicational functions  create list,   save products and past findings, share information         Chapter six:  Comparative study of in-store mobile commerce applications  123  Table 6.1  Mapping Functional Requirements to Design Features  Functional requirements   Check product prices  discounts Find additional product  information  Compare value of similar  products  Features   Scan the barcode or the whole product say or  type the name code of the product Scan, say, or type product to find information  about its characteristics, guarantee, country of  origin, etc., via an automated database search Compare a product with a list of similar ones  provide consumer reviews suggest similar  products  Calculate total shopping cost Automate calculation of total cost of selected  products, for example, scan product to add  prices calculate existing price discounts On map location tracking of nearby stores that  sell the same product in different prices Scan, say, or type product to check via the store’s  database if it is available in the store’s stock Indoor searchable store map Scan and store loyalty cards, create an account  that collects data of past purchases Provide features such as “create new list,” “edit  current list,” “add to wish list”  Search product in nearby  stores Check product availability in  the store’s stock Locate product in the store Purchase product  Create and manage  shopping list  Networking objectives:     Maximum connectivity    Maximum frequency bandwidth    Maximum coverage area    Efficient location-based services    Availability of resources provided in mobile devices  Stemming from the aforementioned objectives, a design framework can  be  formulated   Table  6.1   presenting  features  that  attempt  to  address  predefined user requirements. This will be evaluated during the on-site  evaluation.  6.4.3  On-site evaluation and comparative study In an attempt to evaluate if the objectives gathered earlier were met in  existing high-ranking mobile shopping applications and to identify addi- tional characteristics and design features, we performed an on-site evalu- ation of such application features in a contextual setting. For this purpose,  we chose to conduct an on-site study in the public store, located in the The  Mall  Athens shopping center  a large shopping mall in Athens, Greece .         124  Mobile Electronic Commerce  We selected a number of applications based on user ratings, availability,  and features so as to cover as many as previously identified  Table 6.2 . We  interviewed a number of customers  20 customers  and provided a device  for them to interact with features of selected applications. Free Internet  access was available by the store.  At first, we required that the customers download the specific appli- cations to their own smartphones and spend some time using each fea- ture except from functions such as “add to cart” or “purchase product.”  During the overall process, we interacted with the users, asking various  questions and observing user patterns. Answers collected approximately  matched the questionnaires results. Participants were mostly interested  in features such as checking online product prices, finding discounts and  reviews or local stores that were selling the same product inside the mall,  as they supported that it is the only thing that the staff cannot actually  answer. They were also equally satisfied by either having to scan the bar- code of a product or the product itself as the recognition was most of the  times accurate and fast. However, they negatively commented on the fact  that some applications still required a manual entry of the product’s name,  for example, the title of a book. Finding details for a product was one of  the features that did not gain much attention, as participants claimed that  the store had a very good description of every product in the showroom. When  questioned  about  the  “create  a  list”  feature,  most  of  the  par- ticipants replied that it could be really useful as they tend to forget their  shopping notes at home or lose them. They also found it useful to be able  to save some products in a new list which they could organize later. A par- ticipant commented that “I would definitely use it when window shop- ping  for  Christmas  presents,  so  as  to  make  a  remember-to-buy  list  for  later.” Possibly, this feature could be used at later time to review product  information on a personal computer and find bargains.  Most of the participants though found the “share to friends” feature  not that interesting, supporting that they would not want to share infor- mation regarding a personal purchase on Facebook or other social sites,  but they would rather like to share a product with a specific friend so as  to get his opinion  possibly by email . They did not seem to make use of  the total calculation cost as they believed it would require too many steps  to be completed.  None of the selected applications gave us the chance to test features  such as “check product availability” and “product location tracking,” so  we asked participants if they would possibly use one of these features.  Interestingly, one of the participants answered that “I would be amazed  to have the chance to find if a product is available in stock, as sometimes  staff lies if it is on bargain or offer.” Most of the participants found location  tracking an interesting feature, as long as it is used for finding a product  available in the shopping center.

We  enquired if they would trust an application with their bank account or  credit  card  details  so  as  to  electronically  purchase  an  item.  Responses  were equally balanced. Some participants replied that they would have  no problem as long as the application was certified by the store, otherwise  they would like to able to use a voucher or token bought from the store  just for this purpose. Others, although skeptical, supported that paying  without waiting in the queue would be an advantage.  During the interviews, we noticed that most of the participants pre- ferred those applications that offered the fewest functions or even one  specific feature, as they were simpler to use. We enquired about the infor- mation architecture of each application, which one guided them better  and if they were able to understand what they had to press. Most of them  were  disappointed  by  the  general  interface  design  of  the  applications  at hand. They thought that some applications were better at providing  information but had the look and feel of traditional websites as they had to  do a lot of steps to get a result. Application interface design and aesthet- ics were closely linked to store and brand quality. Consistency in func- tionality, information, and visualization across channels is important to  customers  Song et al. 2013 , but careful information design is necessary  for mobile information outlets. One of the participants replied that “for  almost  all  shopping  related  tasks  three  clicks   interactions   should  be  more than enough to get to the required result, as after that I am bored.”  They instead liked those applications that had only one clear function  and  as  a  result  not  so  much  information  screen  cluttering.  They  com- mented  on  the  fact  that  most  of  the  applications  required  some  expe- rience  before  use,  as  their  basic  functions  could  not  be  easily  detected  when operating the application for the first time. A participant reported  that “an application must ease your life rather than make it more compli- cated” after being asked about one of the applications. We finally asked  them if the visual design played a role in spending more time using one  application rather than the rest. Most of the participants commented that  an aesthetic design would definitely prompt them to try the application   a person supported that the use of colors in an application was really  helpful , but again the functionality and accuracy were the most impor- tant factors.  6.5  Conclusion In this chapter, we presented our study of in-store mobile commerce appli- cations and feature selection with the ultimate goal of designing a better  shopping experience. We attempted to identify a complete set of require- ments that should be met when designing an m-commerce application;         Chapter six:  Comparative study of in-store mobile commerce applications  127  this  set  will  lead  to  the  specific   design   principles  of  an  m-commerce  application targeting at improving the overall shopping experience.  Considering the premature stage and the challenges faced in the field  of  m-shopping,  we  performed  a  three-level  research  with  the  purpose  of evaluating and discovering unique requirements. From the literature  review, we managed to collect a number of user requirements and several  constraints deriving from related studies in the mobile shopping field. We  then conducted an online survey to validate our findings according to the  audiences’ preferences and needs, which resulted in a list of functional,  quality,  and  networking  requirements.  In  an  attempt  to  ensure  if  the  objectives gathered are met in existing mobile shopping applications and  to identify design features addressing these requirements, we performed  an on-site evaluation of such application features in a contextual setting.  In addition to the functional properties, our study explored the aspect  of middleware quality. The importance of good visual interface and effi- cient  information  architecture  was  indicated  in  the  on-site  comparative  study, where consumers had to interact with the several application fea- tures.  In  the  field  study,  the  importance  of  simplicity  and  responsive- ness was emphasized. Users tend to be satisfied from an application that  returns  accurate  results  fast  and  without  complexity.  They  also  prefer  applications  with  clearly  defined  functions  and  an  interface  that  pro- vides straightforward navigation. As stated in Alqahtani and Goodwin   2012 , the most important thing when designing mobile applications is to  design the application in such a way that it does not distract the user from  the main purpose of the application. Users also agreed that an aesthetic  visual design, referring to colors, shapes, font types, etc., actually influ- ences them in choosing one application instead of the other and it could  also be used for navigation purposes. However, in the end they based the  value  of  mobile  shopping  applications  in  their  capacity  to  simply  offer  required results on request.  References Adelmann, R. 2007.

India.gov.in is the Indian government’s web portal for citizens. It pres- ents information resources and online services from government sources,  accessible from a single point. It is also known as the National Portal of  India. The objective is to provide a single-window access to the informa- tion and services such as passport, driving licenses, company registration,  and so on, being provided by the Indian government for the citizens and  other stakeholders.  Many urban centers have set up web portals to facilitate the citizen- to-government interface necessary to support the delivery of services. An  electronic interface as a one-stop destination for public access to informa- tion on various aspects of government functions well as a single window  for  the  delivery  of  government  services.  However,  certain  centers  such   131   132  Mobile Electronic Commerce  as rural areas and cities that lack the infrastructure necessary for every   citizen to have web access are disadvantaged because in the absence of  web connectivity, provisioning of government services is done manually.  In regions that do not have Internet access, citizens are forced to wait in  long lines for each service or information request.  On the contrary, India is witnessing an exponential growth of Internet  users on mobile devices that access government information using a cell  phone over the cell carrier network. People in rural India are spending  more than those in urban areas, according to a study by Accenture.  The aforementioned problem and recent developments conclude that  India is moving toward m-government. M-government involves a num- ber of functions, for example, short message service  SMS , applications,  and mobile website. This study focuses on the mobile version of National  Portal of India. At present, National Portal of India does not have a mobile  version; hence, the access to the National Portal of India and its services  is limited on a mobile device. This chapter is an attempt to analyze what  are the factors involved in the mobile site of India.gov.in and what are the  levels of mobile websites.  7.2  Literature review Since the time mobile computing came into the picture, a few developed  government  organizations  have  started  moving  toward  m-government.  Various authors have defined m-government in their own way. Table 7.1  presents definitions of m-government from different researchers over one  decade. It can be noted in Table 7.1 that over the years the definitions have  also evolved. Earlier m-government was more of a subset of e- government,  and  now  it  is  an  independent  identity.  According  to  Kailasam   2012 ,  m-governance  is  not  a  replacement  for  e-governance,  rather  it  comple- ments e-governance.  Extensive  research  on  m-government  has  been  done  over  the  last  decade. Appolis et al.  2012  investigated m-government services and the  barriers to adoption. Surveys were done to ascertain how citizens inter- act  and  access  government  services  and  information  via  their  mobile  phones. Initially, there were studies on issues and challenges related to  m-government. Rossel et al.  2006  explored mobile e-government issues  by analyzing their historical evolution. Carroll  2005  focused on issues  that  would  enhance  or  delay  the  widespread  acceptance  of  m-govern- ment  services  among  the  users  of  public  sector  organizations.  Around  the same time, Kumar and Prasad  2007  discussed some technical and  policy  consideration  of  mobile  technology  in  the  context  of  e-govern- ment, which can be better known as m-government. Antovski and Gusev   2005   have  discussed  not  only  the  issues  related  to  m-government  but         Chapter seven:  Moving toward a mobile website for www.india.gov.in  133  Table 7.1  Definitions of M-Government  Definition   Author   Kushchu  Year   2003  Arazyan Carroll  El-Kiki et al. and  Ntaliani et al.  Sheng and Trimi  Ntaliani et al.  Wang  The strategy and its implementation involving the  utilization of all kinds of wireless and mobile  technology, services, applications and devices for  improving benefits to the parties involved in  e-government including citizens, businesses and all  government units.  2002 A functional subset of all inclusive e-government. 2005 M-Government is largely a matter of getting public   sector IT systems geared to interoperability with  citizen’s mobile services.  2005 M-government is considered as a subset of   e-government comprising another channel to  provide governmental information and services.  2008 M-government is defined as the use of mobile and  wireless communication technology in providing  government service.  2007 Mobile government  m-government  refers to the use  of ICTs by government institutions with the help of  mobile technologies to deliver electronic services to  the public. This definition is derived from the  definition of electronic government because  m-government is its subset of electronic government.  2010 M-government focuses on a complete government   system supported by a perfect m-government  project. It does not simply encompass the use of  m-government tool for the public services, but also a  complex instrument for the development and  implementation of strategies.  Signo  2012 M-government provides multidirectional advantage   with the effective use of wireless devices.  also interoperability, security, openness, flexibility, and scalability, which  according to the researchers were the principles of m-government.  After the issues and challenges, it can be noted in the literature that  the research on m-government shifted to framework and implementation.  Sheng and Trimi  2008  proposed a framework based on the theory of task– technology fit to understand mobile technology  MT  and its implications  for m-government applications. Amailef and Lu  2008  presented a frame- work of mobile-based emergency response system that has five main com- ponents   register,  monitoring,  analysis,  decision  support,  and  warning   aiming to provide a new function and service to m-government. The leg- islative and regulatory considerations during design and implementation         134  Mobile Electronic Commerce  of  m-government  initiatives  and  during  any  postimplementation  were  studied by McMillan  2010 . Rannu et al.  2010  tried to understand the  mobile phone as a value-adding device in government services. In 2009,  Fasanghari and Samimi developed six stages  five phases  m-government  model. In this model, all of the required phases for implying mobile tech- nologies in government service delivery to citizens are considered. El-Kiki  and Lawrence  2007  highlighted and defined the barriers to the success of  m-government service projects.  In the past few years, the research question shifted from issues and  framework to adoption of mobile government. Appolis et al.  2012  stud- ied the availability of m-government services, and the barriers to adop- tion of m-government were investigated. Abdelghaffar and Magdy  2012   introduced a conceptual model for youth adoption of m-government ser- vices in developing countries. Zamzami and Mahmud  2012  examined  m-government services in three main areas: mobile interface design from  different government sectors, the information quality of the applications,  and whether this information has met user satisfaction.  7.3  M-government and India India is aggressively moving toward m-government though it is at nascent  stage. SMS is in the lead among other m-government facilities, the rea- son being that people in India, especially in rural India, use a normal cell  phone  handset  with  basic  features  of  SMS,  call,  watch,  music,  etc.,  and  not a smartphone where they can use a website or a mobile application.  Following are some successful cases where m-government has become an  integral part of citizens of India:     Farmers of Haryana can use SMS for agriculture problems. SMS for  immediate redressal of agriculture-related problems of the farmers  in the state, introduced by the Haryana Agriculture Department in  2007,  has  been  a  success  with  the  farmers  asking  a  wide  range  of  questions from experts. This free of cost service was launched on  February 02, 2007, and the farmers could send an SMS for immedi- ate redressal of their queries. The concerned specialists and officials  answer questions sent to the department through this service within  24–48 h telephonically.     Mobile  phones  have  been  used  by  fishermen  in  Kerala  for  a  decade.  Fishing  is  a  vital  industry  in  this  part  of  south‐west  India,  employing  over  one  million  people.  The  Harvard  econo- mist Robert Jensen has studied the effect that the spread of mobile  communications  has  had  on  the  fishermen’s  livelihoods.  The  arrival of mobile phones in the region meant that fishermen could  compare prices and demand for fish across the area. This led to         Chapter seven:  Moving toward a mobile website for www.india.gov.in  135  the  setting  of  a  single  rate  for  sardines  along  the  Kerala  coast,  eliminated any wasted catches, and saw a fall in consumer prices.  This more efficient market benefited everyone. Consumer prices  fell by an average of 4%, and there was an 8% rise in the average  fisherman’s profits, meaning that mobile phones usually paid for  themselves within the first 2 months.     Dr. SMS is a novel project of the Kerala State IT Mission—the tech- nology implementation wing of the Government of Kerala in India,  launched  on  May  29,  2008,  with  the  aim  to  increase  the  access  of  health care services by common people through simple and inno- vative use of mobile telephony. The project aims at improving the  health of the citizens of Kerala by    Improving access to health care resources by making available   authentic information on the same     Providing timely information on medical and diagnostic facilities    Providing informational alerts about emerging diseases  The main idea behind this project has been to enable people to use their  mobile  phones  to  receive  information  on  health  resources.  The  project  aims  at  providing  users  with  a  comprehensive  list  of  medical  facilities  available in a particular locality including hospitals with infrastructure  and expertise in various medical specialties  cardiology, gynecology, etc. ,  specialized doctors in the locality, all through the simple facility of the  SMS. Since an SMS is used to gain information on medical services, the  project has been named Dr. SMS.     Education sector in India: the most popular use of mobile technol- ogy  in  the  education  space  through  SMS.  This  has  been  used  to  impart English language training, conducting tests, sending alerts  for  examination  dates,  results,  etc.  Multimedia  messaging  service   MMS  are also used but are restricted to conducting training and  sending educational messages.     Over the years, banking has transcended from the traditional brick  and mortar model to one where banking services are available any- time anywhere; the portability of mobile phones thus makes mobile  banking  a  much  desired  phenomenon  by  banks  and  customers.  Checking  account  balances  is  the  most  popular  banking  service  used  by  urban  Indians  with  almost  40  million  users,  followed  by  checking last three transactions with 28 million users, and status of  cheques with 21 million users.  Bhatnagar  2009  explores conditions that can promote the use of mobile  phones  for  successful  delivery  of  government  services  to  those  at  the  Bottom  of  the  Pyramid  in  India.  Dr.  D.C.  Misra,  I.A.S.   Retd.   in  2010         136  Mobile Electronic Commerce  conveyed  that  efforts  in  the  direction  of  m-government  so  far  in  India  have been sporadic and piecemeal. No holistic view of m-government has  so far been taken as a result of which the vast potential of m-government  continues to be unrealized.  7.4  Research methodology After looking into the literature and investigating the growth of m-govern- ment in India, it can be noted that m-government is limited to SMS mostly.  According to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India  TRAI , November 5,  2013  http:  www.trai.gov.in  :     Total  cell  phone  subscribers  in  India  are  870.58  million  where  the   monthly average addition is around 20 million.     Urban subscribers of cell phone in India are 520.21 million.    Rural subscribers of cell phone in India are 350.37 million.    There  are  51  million  smartphone  users  in  urban  India  today,  an  89% increase from 2012, when there were just 27 million users. The  study also reveals that the biggest spike is in the youngest age group  between 16 and 18 years, where numbers have gone from 5% in 2012  to 22% this year, a fourfold increase.     Subscribers  who  access  the  Internet  through  cell  phones  are  143.2   millions.  This shows that India has a decent base for m-government services. With  143 million mobile Internet users  which are increasing rapidly , an initial  mobile website of the government can do wonders for the citizens such  as providing a unified view of all government services, providing rele- vant information, etc. The existing portal of India does not have a mobile  version.  7.5  Portal stage model A portal before becoming a one-stop undergoes different growth stages.  There have been over 15 e-government stage models that have been devel- oped in last 10 years. Lee  2010  has done a comprehensive study on this,  in which he has compared and analyzed the e-government growth mod- els and their respective stages.  Before planning for a mobile website, it is important to analyze the  portal  india.gov.in.  The  portal  of  Government  of  India  is  currently  at  the transaction level where in certain cases transactions can be made.  Also at the back-office, there is integration though not fully vertical or  horizontal.        Chapter seven:  Moving toward a mobile website for www.india.gov.in  137  Now, it becomes essential to identify the stages of a mobile website  of  india.gov.in.  A  mobile  website  needs  to  achieve  all  these  stages  in  order  to  give  a  one-stop  satisfaction  to  the  citizen  where  all  the  gov- ernment services are provided to the citizen at a single stop. Maranny   2011  proposed and validated a stage maturity model for m- government  implementation process. The stage maturity model of m-government is  intended  to  measure  the  performance  of  m-government  implementa- tion and to provide the roadmaps and recommendations for the future  directions.  Tripathi et al.  2011  came up with five stages of growth. These stages   are applicable for mobile website as well:     Information:  Stage  governments  are  focused  on  establishing  an  online presence for the government and is mostly limited to online  presentations of government information.     Interaction:  A  more  sophisticated  level  of  formal  interactions  bet- ween citizens and service providers is facilitated through e-mail and  “post comments” area.     Transaction:  empowers  citizens  to  deal  with  their  governments   online anytime.     Integration: Vertical integration refers to local, state, and federal gov- ernments  connected  for  different  functions  or  services  of  govern- ment. At stage three, federal, state, and local counterpart systems are  expected to connect or, at least, communicate to each other. At hori- zontal  integration  stage,  databases  across  different  functional  areas  communicate with each other and ideally share information, so that  information obtained by one department will propagate throughout  all government functions.     Transformation: One-stop mobile portal for India.gov.in.  As of now, it would be better to start with the first stage, that is, informa- tion stage, the reason being that citizens can easily acquire the knowledge  about government services. For example, a citizen can get the information  about passport issue, tenders, latest events, etc.  7.6    Mobile websites: Features, different from  desktop websites, India’s mobile site?  It  is  determined  that  the  mobile  website  providing  information  will  be  appropriate for the time being. There are certain features that a mobile  website  must  have  when  compared  with  the  desktop  website.  Table  7.2  highlights  major  differences  between  mobile  websites  and  normal  websites.        Mobile Electronic Commerce  Table 7.2  Features of Mobile Website versus Desktop Website  138  Basis   Content prioritization  Vertical instead of  horizontal navigation  Bars, tabs and  hypertext  Mobile websites versus websites   In comparison to the design of websites for desktop  computers—typically, for a 1024 × 768 screen  resolution—the biggest challenge in designing a  website for a smartphone with a 320 × 480 screen  resolution is how to cope with this dramatic difference  in screen size without sacrificing the user experience.  While desktop websites often contain a wide range of  content, mobile sites usually include only the most  crucial functions and features—particularly those that  leverage time and location. Mobile site designs should  give priority to the features, and content users are  most likely to need when viewing a site using a  mobile device. Horizontal navigation is a widely accepted means of  structuring and presenting content on desktop  websites. Users scan a navigation bar from left to  right, and then click a link to go to a different section  of a site. When a navigation bar is at the top of a page,  users can typically more easily focus on page content  rather than being visually attracted to the navigation  bar on the side. However, vertical navigation has  replaced horizontal navigation on more than 90% of  the mobile sites we analyzed. Hypertext is the signature component of the Internet  and the web. However, we see much less hypertext  on mobile pages. It is not that pages are no longer  linked, but that links instead appear in the form of  bars, tabs, and buttons. The reason for this is the  optimization of mobile design for users’ operation of  mobile devices with their fingers. Hypertext is ideal  when users click links using a mouse on a computer,  but tapping links using your fingers on a touchscreen  mobile device is not easy. Users can too easily  activate a link they did not intend to tap and  accidentally land on an undesired page. This can lead  to a bad user experience. Fitts’s law tells us that the  time required to acquire a target area is a function of  the distance to and the size of the target. Bigger  objects such as bars, tabs, or buttons allow users to  tap with more precision. It is essential to make the  actionable objects on mobile sites big and easily  noticeable.   Continued         Chapter seven:  Moving toward a mobile website for www.india.gov.in  139  Table 7.2  Continued   Features of Mobile Website versus Desktop Website  Basis  Text and graphics  Contextual and global  navigation  Breadcrumbs  Mobile websites versus websites   On web pages, we can use graphics for many different  purposes such as promoting, marketing, or navigating.  However, designers often remove promotional or  marketing graphics from the designs of mobile sites.  The company logo remains for navigational purposes.  Users can tap it to go to the home page. There are  several reasons for this transition from many to few  graphics. One reason is that some mobile devices do  not support the software we traditionally use for  desktop website design. Other reasons include the  small screen sizes of mobile devices and the limited  available screen real estate in which to display content  as well as the slow download speeds on mobile devices. Desktop websites typically use various forms of  navigation. Some of them are global and remain  consistent across a site, while others are contextual  and change depending on where users are on a site.  However, while global navigation is common on  mobile sites, contextual navigation is not. The main  reason for the reduction of global and contextual  navigation on mobile sites is the limited screen real  estate on mobile devices. However, a lack of global  and contextual navigation may cause users to find  themselves in the middle of nowhere, not knowing  where they are. Therefore, it is essential to reduce  hierarchy when organizing the content on mobile  sites, so users do not have to dig too deeply to get  things done. They should be able to achieve what they  want to accomplish before becoming lost. On desktop websites, breadcrumbs are an effective way  of reassuring users they are on the right page and  allow them to backtrack on their navigational path.  They make sense for large, hierarchical websites with  lots of different contents at multiple levels in a  hierarchy. However, breadcrumbs rarely appear on  mobile sites, and there is usually no necessity for  them. Limited space is one reason breadcrumbs are  uncommon on mobile sites. But the main factor is that  the design of mobile sites prevents users from having  to go too deep into a hierarchy to find what they are  looking for. Again, users should be able to achieve  what they want to accomplish on a site before they  start feeling lost.   Continued         140  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Table 7.2  Continued   Features of Mobile Website versus Desktop Website  Basis  Progress indicator  Mobile websites versus websites   On desktop websites, when users must progress  through multiple steps to complete a process— whether they are making a purchase or filling out a  long registration form—there is often a progress  indicator at the top of the page to guide users through  the process. Such progress indicators do not appear on  mobile sites. Again, limited space is the main reason.  Use alternative approaches to make users aware of  their progress without a progress indicator. For  example, instead of using buttons with implicit actions  such as Next or Continue, use buttons with explicit  labels that inform users exactly what the next step  is—for example, Proceed to Checkout or Specify  Shipping & Payment. Users still receive information  about where they are in a process and what to expect  at the next step. Smartphones or mobiles with Internet are  communications devices, so making phone calls is  their most basic function. While mobile platforms  place many limitations on design and content, they  also open up new opportunities that traditional  websites cannot provide. For example, there is  better integration with phone functions such as  direct calling and text messaging, which lets mobile  sites facilitate ordering products by phone or  sending promotional text messages. Usually, mobile  sites let users select a phone number, then call or  text that number—without having to type the  number. There are two types of footers that are in common use  on desktop websites. One type of footer provides links  to content that users might expect to see on a site’s  home page, but has a lower priority than the primary  content on the home page—for example, Careers or  Sitemap. Another type of footer provides quick links  to content users typically need to view most often.  These quick links are often grouped in lists in a footer,  so that users have access to them across a site. Mobile  sites employ footers that provide access to content  users often looking for on a home page, keeping its  links to a minimum, but they do not use footers  containing quick links.   Continued   Integration with  phone functions  Footers        Chapter seven:  Moving toward a mobile website for www.india.gov.in  141  Table 7.2  Continued   Features of Mobile Website versus Desktop Website  Basis  Localized and  personalized search  Mobile websites versus websites   Another area of opportunity that is unique to mobile  sites is the use of geo-location services or support.  While this technology has been available for some  time, only in the last 5 years has it gained traction in  the consumer marketplace. Now, it is commonplace  for mobile applications and websites to take  advantage of this functionality by integrating it into  value-adding services such as mobile search. Many  mobile devices can automatically detect where users  are and give them local search results. This capability  offers powerful opportunities for businesses to  promote their products or services based on a person’s  proximity to their place of business and their  immediate intent. Perhaps the most obvious, screen resolution is of course  hugely different for a mobile browser than for a  regular PC Mac browser. The typical screen resolution  is anywhere from around 120 pixels wide for a mobile  device, whereas the most popular resolution is a  minimum of 1024 pixels wide for regular monitors.  Content designed for a regular browser simply will  not display properly in a mobile browser out of the box.  Changes have to be made if the browsing experience is  to be any good at all. Navigation links are more often than not consigned to  the left vertical portion of the screen when viewing a  website on a PC Mac-based browser. In mobile web  browsing this is not the case—the norm is to have page  navigation near to, or right at the very top of each  page, for ease of navigation using a mobile browser.  Given the limited page width, the key to viewing page  content on a mobile browser lies in the vertical  axis—everything has to flow vertically, rather than  horizontally. Images and other page elements can contribute an  unnecessarily high amount to the overall page size.  This might not seem much of an issue in today’s  high-bandwidth world, but for mobile web browsers  this can be a real problem, particularly given the fact  that many mobile users pay a premium fee for data  transfer to their mobile. Every byte counts, so ensuring  a mobile site treats elements such as images  appropriately can make a huge difference.   Continued   Screen resolution  Navigation  Bandwidth        Table 7.2  Continued   Features of Mobile Website versus Desktop Website  Mobile Electronic Commerce  142  Basis  Image sizes  Contrast and color  schemes  Touch vs. click  Mobile websites versus websites   Images that are designed for viewing on large monitors  can of course look garishly large on a mobile device  screen. Although image sizes can of course be resized  on-the-fly by some modern mobile web browsers   in dimensional terms , this often leads to distorted  images and, again, a poor quality browsing  experience. When looking at a regular site using a large, well lit,  quality LCD screen all of the subtleties and color  shades used in a website can be appreciated.  Conversely, when bustling along a busy street, one  hand holding a mobile phone, eyes squinting at a  small screen, a whole new set of issues come into play.  Suddenly, design elements become less important—the  clarity of the information becomes paramount  simply  to be able to read it! . Finger tapping is less precise than mouse clicking.  Unlike a precise mouse pointer on your desktop, the  human finger is a blob, and finger tapping requires  large targets on the screen for hyperlinks. Expect to  see larger rectangular tap targets  tiles  on mobile  web pages, and fewer text-based hyperlinks.  Additionally, menus will often be replaced with  large buttons and large tabs to accommodate the  imprecision of finger taps.  7.7    Making government websites  mobile compliant  The Government of India will support a one web approach to govern- ment  websites.  “One  web  means  making,  as  far  as  is  reasonable,  the  same  information  and  services  available  to  users,  irrespective  of  the  device or the browser they are using.” This also confirms to the guide- lines laid down in the Right to Information Act  RTI  of Government of  India. This means that the mobile device compatibility of all the gov- ernment websites should be ensured. It has been estimated that mobile  users in India will reach one billion subscribers by 2015. Although not  all of the devices used by the citizens may be enabled currently for full  web access, it does not underscore the importance of web content on  mobile devices. It is proposed through this recommendation that stan- dards for mobile accessibility of central and state government websites  be  established  and  that  best  practice  guidelines  for  enabling  mobile         Chapter seven:  Moving toward a mobile website for www.india.gov.in  143  access to government sites be followed. Provided in the following are  some of the guidelines that may be adopted:                 1. Central  and  state  government  websites  should  consistently  enable   mob ile  site  access  as  new  sites  are  designed  and  implemented.  Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0 from the World Wide Web Consortium   W3C   at  http:  www.w3.org TR 2008 REC‐mobile‐bp‐20080729  may be referred to while formulating standards for enabling mobile  web access.  2. All  government  agencies  should  use  mobile  optimized  content  as  a  primary  method for device support, with device specific style sheets  as  appropriate.  It  may  be  noted  that  in  some  smartphone  instances   e.g., iPhone, Windows Mobile Phones, PalmPre, Android, and so on  not  much effort may be required to render a usable website on the device.  3. Mobile website access should be supported by CSS specific files for  major  smartphone  devices  using  any  of  several  device  detection  methods such as the Wireless Universal Resource File  WURFL  at  http:  wurfl.sourceforge.net to redirect to specific mobile implemen- tations. Other types of web-enabled mobile devices, when detected,  should  degrade  gracefully  to  text-based  CSS  implementations  for  less capable devices.  4. Specialized  website  addresses  for  mobile  sites  should  be  avoided  in  preference  to  using  standard  web  addresses.  As  an  example,  a  single URL address, www.india.gov.in, should render the website on  a computer browser or a mobile device through a dedicated script  that is capable of detecting the device used and redirect to the cor- responding content structure.  5. The  government  websites  should  avoid  the  use  of  large  graphics,  image  buttons,  or  graphic  rich  form  elements,  and  assume  con- strained resources for bandwidth, screen size, color, and resolution  peculiar to mobile devices.   The government websites, before being made live for citizen use,  should be tested for mobile website implementations in as many tar- geted devices and simulators as is practicable.     7.8  Analysis Considering the facts such as adoption of large number of cell phones in  India; mobile website’s different stages; different features of mobile and  desktop websites; and one web, some useful insights can be highlighted:     India  is  at  the  nascent  stage  of  m-government.  However,  there  is  an exponential growth in cell phone subscribers in India. Not only  urban but rural India is moving toward mobile phones, hence mak- ing the base for m-government.        144  Mobile Electronic Commerce     There is a positive increase in the number of Internet subscribers on  wireless devices in India. This shows that apart from SMS and calls,  a government website can be very useful for citizens.     Mobile website of the government has to undergo different stages, from  providing basic information to the citizens to a one-stop destination for  its citizens. As it can be noted that India is at early stages of m-govern- ment and is moving actively toward m-government, the mobile website  of government must provide information to the citizens.     The  moment  information  website  for  mobile  is  planned,  content  of the website becomes the outmost priority. With a limited screen  size, the content of the mobile website must be clear so that it is eas- ily understood by the citizens.     The bandwidth of India as of now is comparatively low with devel- oped countries. Hence, the size of the mobile website should be small.  Usage of pictures and videos  one in india.gov.in  should be minimal.  7.9  Conclusion and future work India  has  shown  a  remarkable  development  in  e-government  over  the  years.  www.india.gov.in  has  shifted  from  mere  having  a  web  presence  to  an  integration  level.  Concurrently,  India  has  witnessed  significant  growth in not only Internet users and mobile users but also those users  who access the Internet from their mobiles. This grouping has raised an  unquenchable thirst for a mobile version of government website in India.  The mobile website will not only be a lighter version but also provide sig- nificant information to the citizens at one place.  This  chapter  analyzes  the  current  scenario  that  forms  the  basis  of  a  mobile version of www.india.gov.in. Before coming up with a final design  of  mobile  version,  it  is  important  to  check  the  current  status  and  predict  the growth of mobile subscribers in urban as well as in rural India. Then it  becomes vital to plan the level of the mobile website. In this study, it has been  found that the information level is the most appropriate one to start with.  This study can be applied to different government organizations as  well. Moreover, a similar study can be done for commercial websites. As  a  future  work,  a  complete  mobile  website  design  of  www.india.gov.in  can be developed that will include both technical and managerial issues.

Initially, this activity was performed on a stand-alone, hardwired PC. Then  wireless systems were developed. This allowed movement of the device  used in e-commerce. This gave way to m-commerce. M-commerce ensures  the ability to conduct electronic commerce using a mobile device no mat- ter where the customer is geographically  assuming the mobile device can  connect to an appropriate network . The term “mobile commerce” origi- nally meant “‘the delivery of electronic commerce capabilities directly into  the consumer’s hand, anywhere, via wireless technology’  Morris 1997 ”   Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 2013, 2 .  “With the proliferation of smartphones over the past couple of years, it  is easy to forget that mobile commerce  m-commerce  began back in 1997  when the first two mobile phone-enabled Coca-Cola vending machines  were  installed  in  Helsinki,  Finland.  Those  machines  accepted  payment  via SMS text messages”  Sahota 2011 .  “Mobile commerce, as a term, has taken on a dual meaning, describ- ing  both  making  online  payments  or  purchases  from  a  mobile  device   mobile e-commerce  and using a mobile device to make payments at a  physical  store’s  point  of  sale”   Roggio  2013 .  “Over  a  billion  people  use  the PC platform to interact with the Internet and yet security breaches are   147   148  Mobile Electronic Commerce  still an issue for the apparently ‘mature’ technology”  Staff Writer 2011 .   mobiThinking  gave  the  figure  of  5.3  billion  subscribers  in  the  mobile  market  the web page is dated 2011   Staff Writer 2011 . The PC platform   numbers may be going down  replaced perhaps by the mobile market , but  the mobile market will continue to grow in numbers. As the mobile mar- ket continues to grow, those who would try to hack into mobile devices  will also grow in numbers  Staff Writer 2011 .  This means that the security for mobile devices used for m-commerce  must improve substantially. Authentication has been a major problem for  some time in networking. Both sides of the connection must be authen- ticated as to who they say they are. The website must indicate their true  validity  usually via a digital certificate  Symantec  . The customer must  validate their credentials as well. This is often done by the customer log- ging in to their account on the website. After an account has been set up,  the log-in procedure can be automated via software  app  so the username  and password combination is automatically sent to the website when the  customer  uses  a   mobile   device  to  access  the  website.  Obviously,  this   convenience may be a problem if the mobile device is lost.  “Mobile devices have  become computers in their  own right, with a  huge array of applications, significant processing capacity, and the ability  to handle high bandwidth connections. They are the primary communi- cations device for many, for both personal and business purposes”  Silva  2012 . So the advantages disadvantages of computers now apply to mobile  devices.  Typically,  in  e-commerce m-commerce,  a   mobile   device  will  com- municate with a website on a network  Internet  and search the website  for a desired product. The catalog is served up via a database of the orga- nization’s products. Once a product s  is chosen, the customer logs in to  the website  if not previously done  and fills out a form, and the product is  sent to the customer. The product could be some sort of service, software,  or a physical product. The service or software may be electronically sent  to the customer. The physical product would be shipped later. The prod- ucts that the customer looks at in the catalog can be saved as part of the  customer’s account on that website. This information could be used by the  organization as part of a marketing plan toward the customer, or it could  be sold to another organization. One or more databases contain the web- site’s catalog and the customer’s information.  Cookies  may  be  used  to  pass  information  between  the  web  server  and  the  browser  and  also  used  to  send  the  user  a  customized  page  or  to identify the user  Webopedia . The cookie law used in the EU “covers  the use by business of information stored on users’ ‘terminal equipment’  and this covers mobile sites and apps as well as desktop sites”  Charlton  2012 . Cookies may be associated with browser use and tracking e-mails.  They may also have to be considered in mobile apps and other tech channels         Chapter eight:  Security in mobile electronic commerce  149   Charlton 2012 . Getting the user to consent to use a cookie when they are  online looking at products and or making a purchase may be more prob- lematic due to the fact that the screens are smaller. This may also cause the  user to stop their current process and go to another site  Charlton 2012 .  8.2  Changing business models Do  business  models  change  for  mobile  e-commerce?  Yes  and  no.  It  is  possible to take a business model used in the regular business world and  implement it online  as a website  where nonmobile and mobile devices  can access the website. Accessing the website via a mobile device is much  more convenient for the customer. It may, however, not be better for the  customer  or  the  organization.  Security  issues  come  into  play  when  the  customer accesses a website with a mobile device.  Some  basic  business  model  categories  are  given  in  a  web  page  by   Rappa  2010 :     Brokerage    Advertising    Infomediary    Merchant    Manufacturer  direct     Affiliate    Community    Subscription    Utility  Rappa 2010   It  is  interesting  to  note  that  most  of  these  business  models  have  been  implemented in the regular business world. Most of these business mod- els put information into a database and allow the customer to access that  database remotely.  Joseph  lists  other  types  of  business  models  for  e-commerce    Joseph 2014 :     Vanity    Storefront    Subscription    Business-to-business    Affiliate marketing  Joseph 2014   The vanity business model allows the developer to blog their opinions and  earn some income through advertisements placed on the website  Joseph  2014 . Affiliate marketing allows an organization to sell some products of  another organization and get commission for their efforts. Again, most         150  Mobile Electronic Commerce  of these business models have been implemented in the regular business  world. The main difference between these business models and their reg- ular business counterparts is that the former are accessed with a mobile  device.  Many regular business models are extended to an online environment.  This may make for a more convenient and  with a correct website design   satisfying  customer  experience.  Happy  customers  are  usually  the  ones  who return to the website.  There is at least one area where business models have changed  or may  be changing : payment in the mobile environment  Tode 2013 . “Several  trends promise to disrupt the payments space this year, with mobile play- ing an important role as key players look to deliver greater value for mer- chants and customers, according to a new report from Forrester”  Tode  2013 . Competition in the mobile payment environment may well produce  new business models for this industry. Some are being tested now  Tode  2013 .  For  example,  LevelUP  is  linking  a  quick  response   QR   code  to  a  credit debit  card.  This  is  to  make  the  transaction  free,  fast,  and  simple   Tode  2013 .  LevelUp  “uses  marketing  fees  to  replace  interchange  fees,  with merchants paying LevelUp for delivering new and returning cus- tomers to their business”  Tode 2013 .  “QR code  abbreviated from Quick Response Code  is the trademark for a  type of matrix barcode  or two-dimensional barcode  first designed for the  automotive industry in Japan. A barcode is an optically machine-readable  label that is attached to an item and that records information related to that  item”  Wikipedia 2013, 3 . QR codes cannot be read by humans and must  be read by a QR code reader. There are smartphone apps to read QR codes.  However, the QR code reader app should always read the contents of the  QR code in a sandbox as there may be malware concealed within the QR  code information. The QR code information can contain URL information  and  under certain circumstances  automatically take the smartphone to  a malicious web page  Mazhar 2011 . There are QR code generators avail- able on the Internet  just search on “QR code generators” . So it may be  possible for an individual to develop a malicious QR code and print it out  via a printer. If an unsuspecting individual scans this malicious QR code,  their mobile device may become infected with malware.  “Next  generation  smartphones  or  tablets  equipped  with  fingerprint  scanners  may  provide  shoppers  with  greater  security  and  boost  both  online and in-store mobile commerce”  Roggio 2013 . “The argument that  biometric security—i.e., using human traits for identification—will affect  mobile commerce includes the idea that biometrics, like fingerprint scan- ners, will be both more secure and easier to use than existing mobile pay- ment security methods”  Roggio 2013 . This fingerprint scanner will make  logging  in  to  the  mobile  device  easier  and  mobile  commerce  shopping         Chapter eight:  Security in mobile electronic commerce  151  easier   remotely  or  in  a  physical  store   and  more  secure   Roggio  2013 .  However,  a  report  already  indicates  this  security  technology  may  have  been hacked. A simple process to defeat this security apparatus was used   Finkle 2013 .  Mobile  devices  tend  to  be  smaller  and  therefore  more  mobile.  The  screen  size  may  present  a  problem  with  regular  websites.  Due  to  this,  m-commerce  websites  may  have  to  be  adapted  for  the  mobile  device’s  smaller  screen.  This  may  mean  less  graphics  and  better  use  of  fonts   Janssen 2010–2014 . Some organizations may have a website for regular  viewing and also one for mobile device viewing  Butkovich 2013 . When  a customer visits the website, the server could sense if the user is using  a mobile device and redirect the request to the appropriate site  both of  which could be on the same server .  Tracking customers inside physical stores is an experiment that some  retailers are pursuing. If a customer chooses a product, then the customer  may receive a message describing an associated product  Brandon 2013 .  “Location-based  tracking  is  getting  much  more  precise.  New  technolo- gies  like  magnetic  field  detection,  Bluetooth  Low  Energy,  sonic  pulses,  and even transmissions from the in-store lights can tell when you enter  a store, where you go, and how you shop”  Brandon 2013 . This tracking  may be done without allowing a customer to opt out. A good deal may be  costing us our privacy  Brandon 2013 .  8.3  Security This may be the most important aspect of mobile electronic commerce.  Without appropriate security, the organization may not remain in business  for a long period of time. Security hacks to the organization’s network and  database may cause the organization’s name to be disgraced and lawsuits  may be filed against the organization. Security is intertwined throughout  the development and usage of mobile electronic commerce. Some of the  security considerations are mentioned earlier indicating how much secu- rity is such a big part of this process.  It  should  be  remembered  that  even  mobile   wireless   devices  must  send  their  messages  through  networks.  If  portions  of  these  networks   routers,  servers,  etc.   are  compromised,  then  the  information  sent  may  also become compromised. Encryption should take care of this problem,  that is, even if the message is captured by a hacker  via a sniffer , it could  not be read. This is not as true as it has been in the past. It should also be  remembered that mobile devices transmit their messages via radio waves.  Anyone with the correct equipment can intercept the signal. Whether it  can be decrypted is another issue.  Bring your own device  BYOD  presents additional security problems.  There are potential problems when personal data and the corporation’s         152  Mobile Electronic Commerce  data  are  saved  on  a  mobile  device.  These  two  sets  of  data  should  be   separated  on  the  mobile  device.  Corporate  network  endpoints  must  be  protected with the appropriate security. Access from outside of the cor- porate  network  that  is  not  authorized  should  be  stopped  by  a  firewall.  Allowing mobile devices an access to the corporate network may be cir- cumventing the network’s security. If the mobile devices have malware  on them, the corporate network may become infected with this malware   Kaspersky 1997–2013 .  The connection between a mobile device and an e-commerce website  should always be secure. This is especially the case when the customer is  filling out forms, giving credit card numbers, etc. Usually, there is an icon in  the mobile devices browser that indicates whether the connection is secure  or unsecure. It is up to the customer to determine if the connection is a  secure one before putting sensitive information into the connection. If the  connection is not a secure one, then the information should not be sent via  the  mobile  device   Butkovich  2013 .  A  secure  connection  over  a  network  requires that both sides of the conversation use secure software. A browser  could  use  secure  software,  but  if  the  e-commerce  website  does  not  use  secure software, then the connection is not secure.  “Gaining the trust of online customers is vital for the success of any  company  that  transfers  sensitive  data  over  the  Web”   VeriSign  2010 .  Without  this  trust,  customers  may  be  unwilling  to  use  the  company’s  website  for  mobile  commerce.  Malware  could  be  on  the  organization’s  website and may be downloaded to the customer’s mobile device.  Of  course,  trust  goes  both  ways.  The  organization  must  be  able  to  trust the customer that has just logged in to their m-commerce website  that the customer is who they say they are and can legitimately pay for  purchased products services.  Phishing  FBI 2009  is an attack that has been around a long time and  can be implemented in mobile and nonmobile environments. This is an  attack where a user is asked for sensitive information  log-in information,  social security number, etc. . This information should not be given out by  the user. The request is often made via the phone or e-mail. Rashid  2011   gives some examples and indicates how they can be recognized. Phishing  attacks can be made in different operating systems and different hard- ware. This is an insidious aspect of phishing attacks.  Spear  phishing   FBI  2009   may  be  thought  of  as  a  targeted  phish- ing attack. Instead of general information in the attack, a spear phishing  attack  contains  more  information  the  targeted  user  may  recognize  and  therefore  conclude  the  request  is  legitimate   FBI  2009 .  Users  should  be  aware that this type of sensitive information should never be requested  electronically.  The  IT  department  does  not  need  a  user  to  give  them  a  user’s log-in name and password. A bank does not request a customer’s  account number via an e-mail.        Chapter eight:  Security in mobile electronic commerce  153  A new targeted attack is called water holing  WEBROOT 2013 . The  attackers determine the website s  that a targeted group of people often  go  to.  Then  they  attempt  to  compromise  the  website s   with  malware  and create a drive-by download  WEBROOT 2013  from the website. When  the targeted group of people visit the website s , they may inadvertently  download the malware  WEBROOT 2013 .  Some malware attacks require that the user perform some action. The  user must click on a URL, open an e-mail attachment, fill out a form, etc.  Other malware attacks are automatic and do not require an action on the  users’ part. Usually, these types of malware are more specific to operat- ing systems and hardware. They also must be downloaded to the target  device  and  then  executed  separately.  The  user  must  usually  be  tricked  into executing the malware.  The network hardware used in the mobile environment runs in a sim- ilar fashion to the nonmobile network environment. This hardware has  operating systems or other software needed to run correctly. Operating  systems and applications  apps  can be attacked. As an example of how  the  mobile  environment  continues  to  become  more  dangerous  for  the   customer user, there is a report that the first-ever malware for the Firefox  operating system will be demonstrated at a conference in New Delhi this  year  Kumar 2013, 1 . “FirefoxOS is a mobile operating system based on  Linux and Mozilla’s Gecko technology, whose environment is dedicated  to  apps  created  with  just  HTML,  CSS,  and  JavaScript”   Kumar  2013,  1 .  All of the apps in the operating system are web apps. There are two types  of apps for this operating system. One type is downloaded to the mobile  device, and the other is on a website  Kumar 2013, 1 . Which type is  better?  Robles   2011   attempts  to  answer  this  question.  Basically,  the  answer  is  “It depends.” It depends on the organization, the app, and the customers  the organization wants to serve. For the same app, both may be  appropriate.  For different apps, one or the other may be more appropriate  Robles 2011 .  Which  one  is  more  secure?  This  question  has  not  been  answered.  This  answer may also depend on the given situation.  On the server side of the network, a recent example is about Oracle.  “Oracle on Tuesday fixed 127 security issues in Java, its database, and  other products, patching some flaws that could let attackers take over  systems”  Constantin 2013 . Systems have become so complex that the  aforementioned  number  of  security  issues  is  not  necessarily  unusual.  These are just two recent examples of the dangerous networked envi- ronment. There are many others, and nothing should be concluded from  the  use  of  these  companies  as  examples.  The  point  is  that  that  there  are individuals  and groups  that will try and take advantage of flaws  in complex systems for their own purposes. This makes the Internet a  dangerous  place.  The  risk  of  using  it  must  be  managed  appropriately  by the user customer when they use the Internet to access a resource.         154  Mobile Electronic Commerce  In addition, the user customer expects the organization to make their  website as secure as reasonably possible.  Symantec indicates that digital certificates are the answers to users  and devices authentication. These certificates are highly secure, stable, and  scalable. They can be used to move data securely over a network  includ- ing the Internet and mobile network . They can also be used to verify that  devices and users are, in fact, who they say they are  Symantec .  8.4  Surveillance In  addition  to  security  issues  in  the  mobile  environment,  mobile  devices may be under surveillance. Spiegel has seen documents, which  are  classified,  that  indicate  the  National  Security  Agency   NSA   has  set up working groups to determine procedures to access three mobile  platforms that are very popular. The NSA wants to be able to access the  user’s location, their contact lists, and SMS  short messaging service    Musil  2013 .  One  of  the  devices,  the  BlackBerry,  is  considered  to  be  very secure. The other two popular devices are Android and iPhone   Rosenbach et al. 2013 .  Between 2010 and 2011, the NSA tracked US mobile phones in a pilot  project that at the time was secret. Mobile phone location data were col- lected. Basically, it was a test project to see if this information could be  captured and stored in the system  Gallagher 2013 .  General  Keith  Alexander,  who  is  the  leader  of  the  NSA,  stated  that  there was no current reason to capture mobile device location data at this  time. However, he also stated that there may be reasons for such data col- lection in the future  Serwer 2013 .  Instant messaging and e-mail contact lists from hundreds of millions  of accounts are reportedly being collected by the NSA. This may include  Americans as well. It is currently illegal for the NSA to acquire contact  lists  in  bulk  from  devices  in  the  United  States.  However,  they  can  col- lect this information from other worldwide locations  Homeland Security  FoxNews.com .  One way to try to remain anonymous on the Internet is to use Tor.  Tor  uses  relays  in  a  distributed  network  that  is  within  the  Internet.  Volunteers  run  the  relays.  These  relays  are  distributed  throughout  the  world. The website that the user visits will not be able to determine the  location of the user. In addition, no one can determine the websites that  the user visits  Tor Project: Anonymity Online . Android can access the Tor  network using a package called Orbot  Tor Project: Android Instructions .  It will probably be available on other mobile devices soon  if it is not avail- able already .  Since  Tor  is  basically  a   distributed   network  within  the  Internet,  it  has entry and exit points in the Internet. So users may not be able to be         Chapter eight:  Security in mobile electronic commerce  155  tracked  within  the  Tor  network,  but  they  may  be  able  to  be  tracked  at  these entry and exit points. The NSA has used Google Ads  Rosenblatt  2013  and browser cookies  Kumar 2013, 2  to try and keep up with where  users enter and exit the Tor network. The NSA has also used a vulner- ability in the Firefox browser to try and track these users. They also run  their own relays  nodes   Kumar 2013, 2 . Using browser cookies to track  Tor users may not be as easy as it may seem. Goodin discusses the pro- cess and states that these types of attacks may be possible to use, but only  under certain circumstances  Goodin 2013 .  It is also reported that the NSA is monitoring millions of Americans’  Internet habits  histories on the Internet  even though these Americans  are not suspected to be involved in an activity that is deemed criminal.  Marina  is  the  codename  for  the  program  used  by  the  NSA.  The  data  may be maintained for a year  RT.com 2013 . They may also be monitor- ing contact lists maintained in mobile devices  and nonmobile devices.    FoxNews.com, Politics 2013  This is another aspect of the federal govern- ment’s surveillance that may trouble users in mobile and nonmobile envi- ronments. Part  of these habits histories may include making payments  for  international  transactions  using  credit  cards.  The  NSA  may  have  a  separate portion of the organization to track these transactions  Butcher  2013 . Of course, it may very well be important for the NSA to track some  of  these  transactions  as  they  may  be  involved  with  international  terror  plots. The problem is which of these transactions may be involved in these  types of plots and which ones are not.  Imagine that you are the head of a technology company in America  that  makes  mobile  devices  and or  software  for  mobile  devices.  Your  company  wants  to  sell  these  products  in  America  and  other  countries  as well. Would recent NSA revelations cause an international customer  to pause before they buy your products? Would this affect your compa- nies’ public relations with the international community? Potentially, yes   Ingersoll 2013 .  8.5  Conclusion It should be noted that all of this technology is a double-edged sword. It can  be used for a good purpose or for a nefarious purpose. Today, the technol- ogy is perhaps used for a good purpose. Tomorrow, the same technology  may be used for a nefarious purpose. It is this second situation that should  give us pause. Will the benefits of the mobile technology outweigh the  nefarious costs of the technology? We will see.  Between the security aspects of mobile electronic commerce and the  potential surveillance that may occur on mobile devices, it is very clear  that consumers  users of mobile devices and the Internet  must be very  careful in using this technology. Be safe out there.        156  Mobile Electronic Commerce  References Brandon, J. 2013. Retail stores plan elaborate ways to track you, Smarter America,   FoxNews.com. Accessed July 26, 2013.

The  use  of cell phones to only make phone calls has become a thing of the past.  Cell phones have been replaced with mobile devices, and they have been   packaged  with  enough  hardware  to  run  applications  that  were  previ- ously confined to desktop computers. Everywhere you turn there are new  devices, applications, and ideas flooding the mobile market. It did not take  long for corporate America to take notice of the shift in consumer interest  and take advantage of the mobile market  Smith and Chaffey, 2005; Chang  and Chen, 2009; Serrano et al., 2013 .  161   162  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Mobile applications have been poised to be the singular most influen- tial new software technology in the last two decades. Next to Microsoft  Windows,  no  other  software  innovation  has  garnered  the   attention,   success,  and  financial  backing  that  mobile  applications  have  recently  experienced.  Navigating  the  mobile  application  landscape  is  challeng- ing for organizations  Gavalas et al., 2011; Ko, 2013; Nicolaou, 2013 . While  organizations  may  still  be  struggling  to  recognize  the  full  potential  of  mobile applications, many have come to the realization that mobile appli- cations are a necessary evil and one that customers have come to expect   Deng et al., 2010; Li and Yeh, 2010 .  As  with  any  new  technology,  there  have  been  growing  pains,  and  organizations have had to adapt quickly to the rapidly changing mobile  landscape. What works today is not guaranteed to work tomorrow. This  mantra  is  apparent  in  the  mobile  application  field.  Mobile  application  development as an industry is still in its infancy. As new device operat- ing systems and software packages hit the market, mobile applications  as well as organizations are struggling to keep up with the proliferation  of  devices,  backwards-compatible  applications,  and  consumer  demand   Mahatanankoon  et  al.,  2005 .  Even  with  the  wide  range  of  challenges  and  growing  pains,  the  mobile  application  space  is  currently  the  most  innovative and exciting area of technology today  Nicolaou, 2013; Serrano  et al., 2013 .  With the current batch of mobile applications, we are witnessing the  end of the first generation of mobile applications. This first generation of  applications due to hardware, software, and vendor constraints were lim- ited to run only on a single operating system. For example, Instagram, one  of the most successful mobile applications today, can only be installed on  devices that operate Apple’s iOS. This group of mobile applications is clas- sified as native applications. They are built to run on code that is native to  the device  Charland and Leroux, 2011; Serrano et al., 2013 .  The first generation of mobile application was an important step for  the electronic commerce and many lessons were learned from it. However,  organizations  in  general  do  not  want  to  develop  different  instances  of  the same application for each mobile platform that exists in today’s mar- ket  Hasswa et al., 2007 . Each mobile platform has its own development  language, nuances, personnel commitments, and hardware requirements   Zheng and Ni, 2005 . Whether the application is developed in-house or  outsourced, it is generally an expensive endeavor. When combined with  maintenance costs, short application life cycle, and other fringe expenses,  some organizations are questioning whether native mobile applications are  the right choice for them  Charland and Leroux, 2011; Serrano et al., 2013 .  Hybrid applications combine the development speed and flexibility  of web-based applications with the feature-rich environment and perfor- mance that only a native application can provide. This second generation         Chapter nine:  Enhancing electronic commerce  163  of application architecture is positioned to become the next big innovation  in mobile application development  Fu et al., 2013 . Hybrid mobile appli- cations  are  written  using  standard  web  technologies  such  as  HTML5,  CSS,  and  JavaScript   Nixon,  2011;  Ko,  2013;  Nenava  and  Choudhary,  2013 .  This  code  is  then  bundled  with  third-party  mobile  development   frameworks, and then packaged to run on a variety of mobile device oper- ating  systems. The core application code is written in web technologies.  Thus, it can be modularized and embalmed to run on any mobile device  such as those devices running Apple iOS, Google Android, or Microsoft  Windows Phone. The mobile development framework is what makes this  all  possible. It comprises a thin layer of code that enables the web-based  code  to  access  native  device  functionality  such  as  geolocation  services,  camera  functions,  contact  lists,  and  notification  features  on  the  mobile  device  Haklay et al., 2008; Nguyen-Vuong et al., 2008; Soutschek, 2010 .  As with any new technology there are challenges that must be over- come.  Hybrid  mobile  applications  are  no  different.  This  chapter  will  explore  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  hybrid  applications  and  how  their  unique  set  of  characteristics  affect  organizational  decisions.  This  chapter  will  also  cover  some  of  the  more  popular  development  frame- works, environments, and how they are making hybrid mobile develop- ment  more  streamlined.  Finally,  the  chapter  will  explore  the  future  of  hybrid mobile applications and how advances in HTML5 adoption and  economic realities affect hybrid development  Unhelkar and Murugesan,  2010; Nixon, 2011; Nenava and Choudhary, 2013 .  9.2    What is hybrid mobile application  development architecture?  The current mobile application landscape comprises three types of appli- cation architectures: native, hybrid, and mobile web. To fully understand  what a hybrid application is, it is helpful to have a general knowledge of  the other two application architectures. Every mobile application architec- ture has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. It is important for  organizations and IT professionals to understand the instance where each  architecture is best suited for  Fu et al., 2013; Ko, 2013 .  Native applications are currently the most widely utilized application  architecture.  The  name  “native”  comes  from  the  fact  that  each  applica- tion is written using the native application code for the specific operating  system that the application will run on. For example, applications written  to operate on an Apple device will be coded in the Objective C language.  Applications  coded  to  run  on  Google  Android  will  be  written  in  Java,  while  Microsoft  Windows  Phone  applications  are  coded  in  Microsoft. Net. Native code is generally compiled into an optimized code set which         164  Mobile Electronic Commerce  allows  it  to  run  faster  than  an  interpreted  language  such  as  JavaScript   Charland  and  Leroux,  2011;  Newton  and  Dell,  2011 .  The  requirement  that each native application be uniquely coded for its runtime environ- ment puts both application developers and business planners in a difficult  position. Each instance of a mobile application generally requires separate  resources, development software, planning, and testing. Many organiza- tions  have  come  to  realization  that  the  overall  cost  associated  with  the  development and maintenance of native applications exceeds any positive  organizational impact the app might provide  Nicolaou, 2013 .  Performance is where native applications really shine as well as in the  collection of features they have access to. Being written in the same cod- ing language as the operating system provides native applications with  access to more application programming interfaces  APIs . Most mobile  operating systems prohibit access to certain APIs from nonnative appli- cations. This gives native app developers and designers a larger feature  pool to choose from when designing and developing their  applications.  The  performance  of  the  applications  is  also  a  distinct  advantage  that  native  applications  have  when  compared  to  other  application  architec- tures. Nonnative application code requires an additional step  during the  runtime to translate the nonnative code to native code so that it can be run  on the specific device. This code translation in most circumstances leads  to a degradation in performance  Google Developer, 2012; Fu et al., 2013 . The next mobile application architecture is mobile web apps. Mobile  web apps are applications that operate strictly in a browser and do not  require any native code to function. These types of applications are coded  using the same languages that many websites utilize, such as HTML, CSS,  and JavaScript. Mobile web applications differ from traditional websites  in that they are optimized to run on devices with smaller screens, and  their code is usually paired down to accommodate wireless data transfer  limitations and speeds  Charland and Leroux, 2011; Serrano et al., 2013 .  Mobile web applications in most cases are not installed on the user’s  device. Instead, the application is run in the client’s mobile web browser.  Popular mobile web browsers include Safari on Apple devices, Firefox for  Android, and Opera Mobile. Excluding cookies, browser security param- eters and settings prevent mobile web apps from storing code and infor- mation on user’s devices  Nixon, 2011; Nicolaou, 2013 .  Mobile  web  applications  are  coded  so  that  they  are  not  dependent  on  any  particular  operating  system  or  runtime  environment.  They  pro- vide the same or very similar application code to each device regardless  of  manufacturer, device, or operating system. The write once, deploy any- where concept behind mobile web apps makes them a very affordable and  efficient option when compared to the highly focused and uniquely com- plex native application development. Mobile web applications are unspe- cific by design. They are rarely able to take advantage of native device APIs.         Chapter nine:  Enhancing electronic commerce  165  Therefore, they cannot provide the same level of usability that a full fea- tured native application might provide. The characteristic that mobile web  apps cannot utilize native functionality forces mobile web apps to largely  comprise simple and rudimentary functionality. The native functionality  limitation paired with the fact that mobile web apps must run in a browser  significantly limits the use cases for mobile web apps. This limitation has  excluded  them  as  a  viable  application  development  option  from  many  organizations’ mobile application architecture discussions  Fu et al., 2013 . Organizations  and  developers  struggle  between  choosing  the  high  cost and discontinuity of native application development. They are some- times puzzled with the finding of the more cost effective but less capable  mobile web application development. Organizations and developers have  agreed on one thing in common. They know that they both want a good  and robust application. An application that performs well is stable and  reliable and has limited usability issues. Until the hybrid mobile appli- cation  was  born,  those  requirements  have  always  led  organizations  to  choose native application development  Newton and Dell, 2011 . Hybrid  mobile applications provide developers and organizations with a best of  both worlds solution. Hybrid mobile applications comprise three essential  parts:  the  web-based  application  code,  a  hybrid  application  framework,  and a native application wrapper.  Hybrid application code is written using the same, traditional, web- based languages that a mobile web application would use, such as HTML,  CSS, and JavaScript. This allows the application to be written once and  then deployed on different devices and operating systems with very little,  if any, code changes. To take advantage of native device features and func- tionality, the web-based application code is then coupled with a hybrid  application framework. The framework is a thin layer of native code that  maps JavaScript functions to native APIs, and allows the web-based code  to  call  native  functions  on  the  device.  For  example,  the  framework  can  expose camera and geolocation APIs, allowing developers to incorporate  native  functionality  into  their  apps.  Without  the  hybrid  framework,  a  hybrid application would simply behave like a mobile web app.  The  final  step  for  developing  a  hybrid  mobile  application  involves  encapsulating  the  applications  code  in  a  native  wrapper.  The  wrapper  is  simply  a  basic  native  application  that  contains  the  hybrid  application  framework and the application’s web-based code. The native application  wrapper  allows  developers  and  organizations  to  offer  their  applications  on  various  application  stores  and  marketplaces.  For  example,  an  Apple  iPhone hybrid mobile application would have to be wrapped in a native  iOS  application  so  that  it  could  be  offered  for  download  in  Apple’s  AppStore.  If  an  organization  and  a  developer  wanted  to  offer  the  same  iPhone application on an Android device, they would simply take the web- based application code and the hybrid framework and copy them into a         166  Mobile Electronic Commerce  native Android application. Once packaged and deployed onto a device,  the  Android  app  and  the  iPhone  app  would  both  be  utilizing  the  same  web-based  application  code.  The  hybrid  application  framework  would  handle the native functionality integration on various devices  Unhelkar  and Murugesan, 2010; West and Mace, 2010 . The app would function as  designed on both devices with very little customization. That is the extra  value  hybrid  mobile  applications  provide.  Many  of  the  hybrid  applica- tion frameworks support the wrapping of applications for iOS, Android,  Windows Phone, Blackberry, and WebOS. The hybrid frameworks will be  covered in more detail later in the chapter.  9.3    Advantages and disadvantages  of hybrid mobile application  Hybrid mobile applications may appear to be the easy choice for organi- zations looking to develop a new mobile application, but they are not the  right  choice  for  every  situation.  The  task  of  choosing  a  mobile  applica- tion architecture is no simple task. There is no widely accepted method  of selecting the correct mobile application architecture. This section will  outline a few considerations that organizations should take into account  when determining if the hybrid architecture is right for them.  Organizations, in large part, work very hard to keep pace with what  their competition is doing. As one organization tries to differentiate itself  from its competition, the competition will recognize the organization is try- ing to do something innovative and different. They will likely try to copy  the innovative approaches. This “follow the leader” mentality is especially  evident in the mobile application space, where numerous organizations have  developed a mobile application simply because their competition has one.  In the past, this methodology might have worked, but mobile application  development is different nowadays. Despite the potential and promise of  mobile applications, there is a need to justify their viability, usefulness, and  values to the stakeholders  Keeney, 1999; Nah et al., 2005; Kuo et al., 2009 .  Some organizations have found that the total cost of ownership  TCO  for  mobile applications exceeds any advantages that might be gained by having  a mobile application. Instead of abandoning mobile applications all together,  organizations should look at hybrid mobile applications and investigate how  they could possibly be leveraged to decrease their mobile application’s TCO. One of hybrid mobile application’s main advantages is the idea of code  sharing  and  reuse.  Hybrid  applications  are  written  using  portable  web  technologies. They are easily transferable between operating systems and  devices. This characteristic of hybrid application development allows orga- nizations to have a smaller mobile development team. This special task team  can focus on a standard platform of web coding languages and processes.         Chapter nine:  Enhancing electronic commerce  167  It also allows developers to focus their efforts on other  challenges  including  operating system fragmentation, data management, and network connec- tivity   Gavalas  et  al.,  2011 .  Developers  with  web  development  skills  are  both easier to find and more cost effective in today’s market. In contrast, to  complete a native application, companies would have to either staff more  developers with niche job skills, hire contractors, or be forced to outsource  to a third-party vendor to complete the work. All of these options are not  ideal from an organizational perspective and can lead to over staffing, loss  of project control, loss of core competencies, high maintenance costs, and  fragmented applications  Ko, 2013 .  Another advantage of hybrid mobile applications is that while they  are developed using standard web-based technologies they do not require  that  the  device  be  connected  to  an  external  data  source  for  them  to  be  functional. Similar to a website, mobile web apps require an Internet con- nection so that they can download the required application code. Hybrid  mobile applications are packaged into a native application wrapper and  installed on a user’s device. This gives the application access to all of its  code regardless of external connection or device bandwidth speed.  As stated earlier, hybrid mobile applications are not the perfect choice  for every application. For instances where performance is vital to the suc- cess  of  the  application,  careful  consideration  and  performance  testing  must  be  completed  before  an  organization  selects  hybrid  as  its  mobile  development  architecture.  There  is  an  extra  level  of  code  interpolation  that hybrid applications have to complete that native applications do not.  This extra step causes a slight decrease in application performance. For  many organizations, developers and product owners are sensitive to the  loss in application performance. The loss is trivial when contrasted with  the benefits of hybrid mobile applications. Hence, the performance loss is  deemed acceptable  Williams et al., 2011 .  Another area of concern that application developers must take into  account  when  developing  hybrid  mobile  applications  is  application   security. Contrary to public perception, mobile devices are very secure,  and  there  are  a  number  of  things  that  software  companies  can  do  to  enhance  the  basic  security  functions  built  into  the  devices  themselves   Dwivedi et al., 2010 . Programmers and developers need to be aware of  the  built-in  device  security  functions  as  well  as  the  particular  security   vulnerabilities that are unique to hybrid applications. Some of those vul- nerabilities surround local storage concerns, cross-domain policy changes,  and erroneous i-frame implementations. These security vulnerabilities are  not limited to hybrid mobile applications, but instead are general HTML5  security vulnerabilities. As HTML5 adoption increases, so the attention  will be surrounding these security vulnerabilities  Nixon, 2011 .  Application  security  as  simple  as  password  protection  and  authen- tication  is  incorporated  into  almost  all  new  mobile  devices  and  is  easy         168  Mobile Electronic Commerce  to implement. The layering and encouragement of this kind of security  mechanism,  while  not  linked  to  mobile  applications,  can  significantly  increase the overall security of not only an organization’s application but  also the user’s mobile device as a whole  Dwivedi et al., 2010 .  9.4    Practices of hybrid mobile  application development  9.4.1  Cambridge iReport The city of Cambridge Massachusetts wanted to develop a mobile appli- cation that allows its citizens to report on conditions around the city that  they felt needed attention by the cities services. Engaged Cambridge citi- zens now have an application they can download to their iOS or Android  device that allows them to conveniently and easily report an unplowed  side street, an overflowing trashcan, unsightly graffiti, or any other prob- lems found within the city limits of Cambridge  Angel, 2011 .  The iReport application is a great example of how a hybrid mobile  application  can  be  functional,  useful,  and  successful  while  keeping  a  low TCO. Isite, the company that developed the application for the city  of Cambridge, utilized PhoneGap, a popular hybrid mobile application  framework  Wargo, 2012 . By utilizing PhoneGap, Isite was able to control  costs through code reuse while simultaneously providing an application  that  would  run  on  both  the  iOS  and  Android  platforms.  The  applica- tion  integrates  with  the  cities  online  resolution  system  and  allows  the  application users to seamlessly upload photos and descriptions of spe- cific issues, all while integrating with the native geolocation feature of  the user’s device. Overall, the application has been well received, getting  a 4.5 out of 5 star user rating on Apple iTunes.  9.4.2  Dolphin Tale As Warner Bros Pictures prepared for the debut of their newest full-length  feature film Dolphin Tale, they were looking for an innovative way to intro- duce the movie to potential moviegoers. The organization decided that a  nifty and viral way to promote the movie would be to develop a mobile  game. Warner Bros Pictures selected Trailer Park, a Hollywood entertain- ment-marketing firm, with the development. Operating on a tight sched- ule and budget, Trailer Park knew that they would have to utilize a hybrid  mobile  framework  to  deliver  an  application  that  could  be  deployed  on  both the iOS and Android platforms.  Trailer Park selected Corona software development kit  SDK  as their  hybrid framework for the Dolphin Tale project. Trailer Park stated that was         Chapter nine:  Enhancing electronic commerce  169  the only way they were able to build the app and launch it on time and bud- get. Outside of the advantages hybrid applications offer, such as speed to  market and standardized technologies, organizations also utilize hybrid  frameworks like Corona SDK. Corona SDK allows them to build hybrid  mobile applications in a controlled and supported environment. Corona  SDK provides organizations that use their software with support options.  Developers have access to Corona’s support network during development  for trouble shooting and solution. This level of service affects the organi- zation’s decision making in selecting which framework or architecture to  develop mobile applications  Fu et al., 2013 .  9.4.3  Lotte Awards The hybrid mobile application development and implementation by Lotte  Card highlights some of the main reasons why organizations are choos- ing  hybrid  development  over  native  development.  The  Lotte  Awards  application is a complex and diverse credit card monitoring application  that contains over 100 screens, providing users with essential cardholder  information,  and  has  unique  features  such  as  augmented  reality  and  mobile coupons that can be scanned.  Lotte Card partnered with FAS, an IT solutions provider located in  Korea and Japan, to develop the hybrid application. The entire develop- ment  of  the  project  took  only  2  months.  The  group’s  accelerated  proj- ect  delivery  schedule  was  made  possible  by  the  utilization  of  the  IBM  WorkLight  Mobile  Platform   WorkLight,  2011 .  Similar  to  other  hybrid  application  frameworks  and  platforms,  WorkLight  provides  developers  with a rich set of tools and features that aid mobile application develop- ment  as  well  as  in  the  process  of  combining  native  and  web  code.  The  speed-to-market  gained  through  the  use  of  the  WorkLight  platform  as  well as the web-based technology that surrounds hybrid mobile applica- tions spotlights the efficiencies that hybrid mobile development provides.  The success that the Lotte Awards application has garnered in the iPhone  and Android marketplace has Lotte Card considering a new venture into  a tablet-specific application  IBM, 2012 .  9.5    Frameworks and tools of mobile  application development  The  world  of  hybrid  mobile  applications  is  full  of  new  and  emerging  groups and organizations that are trying to put their stamp on the future  of hybrid development. This section of the chapter will outline some of  the significant players in hybrid mobile applications and what their tools  or frameworks are.        170  Mobile Electronic Commerce  9.5.1  PhoneGap Originally a product of Nitobi, PhoneGap was started in 2009 and was  one of the first hybrid mobile development frameworks. Its innovative fea- tures, open source availability, online community, and high early adop- tion  by  mobile  developers  gave  PhoneGap  much  success  and  fanfare.  PhoneGap was believed to have so much potential for mobile application  development. Adobe Inc. purchased PhoneGap’s parent company Nitobi  in late 2011.  Adobe’s  plans  for  PhoneGap  were  recently  announced  in  a  blog  post  on  the  PhoneGap  website.  There  were  some  concerns  from  the  PhoneGap community that Adobe would start charging for PhoneGap  licenses  or  potentially  change  the  general  purpose  of  the  software.  Adobe has communicated that they intend on keeping PhoneGap free  for the public in an open source version. Apache Cordova will be the  new name for the open source and free version of PhoneGap. PhoneGap  itself will remain the name of Adobe’s version of the software. With the  PhoneGap acquisition, Adobe will likely incorporate it into some of their  other software offerings as an enhancement to their already successful  software packages.  PhoneGap  currently  supports  the  Apple  iOS,  Google  Android,  HP  WebOS,  Microsoft  Windows  Phone,  Nokia  Symbian  OS,  and  RIM  BlackBerry operating systems. Some of the device features that PhoneGap  supports  include  camera  operations,  notifications,  device  local  storage,  network status, geolocation, and contacts. PhoneGap keeps an accelerated  release  schedule  with  releases  being  distributed  on  an  almost  monthly  basis. This allows them to quickly provide customers with both bug fixes  and feature enhancements  Wargo, 2012 .  PhoneGap has also recently introduced a build service which allows  developers  the  ability  to  upload  web-based  code  and  in  return  receive  packages that are ready to be loaded on specific devices. PhoneGap Build  could be a significant time saver for developers who would otherwise have  to maintain development environments for each specific device operating  system  Wargo, 2012; Piao and Kim, 2013 .  9.5.2  Corona SDK With the tagline, “Write once, build to both iOS and Android,” it is easy  to understand why Corona has experienced considerable success in the  mobile application development domain. While Corona seems to be gain- ing  in  popularity,  it  still  remains  to  be  seen  if  it  can  differentiate  itself  enough  from  the  competition.  One  way  that  Corona  is  differentiating  itself  is  by  having  its  own  scripting  language,  Lua.  Lua  is  layered  over         Chapter nine:  Enhancing electronic commerce  171  the native C++ Objective C code and acts as quick translation scripting  language that claims to allow Corona developers the ability to code faster  and  debug  easier.  The  drawback  to  having  a  proprietary  scripting  lan- guage is that in some instances the language limits the customized behav- ior that developers can introduce into their applications. For this reason,  some agencies and developers have decided to choose other standardized  hybrid frameworks instead of Corona SDK.  Corona SDK is a for-profit project and therefore users of the frame- work are charged a yearly subscription fee. The fee covers users to develop  and deploy mobile applications to both iOS and Android. A fee to use  any software is not always a deterrent because the licensing fees usually  include some kind of product support mechanism. Large  organizations  and new developers favor the support aspects in the SDK. It supplies them  with  a  point  of  contact  when  and  if  there  are  issues  during  the  devel- opment life cycle. Corona SDK offers a rich set of device and software  APIs that provide developers with almost endless functionality options.  Some of the APIs include native device functionality support, Facebook  integration, ad network integration, map features, in-App  purchases, and  many others.  9.5.3  WorkLight Organizations are looking for a total package solution to hybrid mobile  application development with direct update capabilities and push notifi- cations. IBM WorkLight falls in this category. WorkLight’s client list spans  a wide range of industries including travel, retail, financial services, tech- nology, and hospitality. Through the use of industry-accepted technolo- gies and tools, WorkLight allows developers and organizations to author  hybrid, mobile web, and native mobile applications.  The technology behind WorkLight is not just a framework but also  includes an integrated development environment  IDE  and a proprietary  middleware consisting of server hardware and software that allows orga- nizations to effectively manage their mobile applications. WorkLight must  have been on the right path, so IBM announced that they had reached an  agreement to acquire WorkLight  IBM Communications, 2011 .  WorkLight  has  a  different  approach  on  hybrid  mobile   applications  and breaks them up into two categories: hybrid web and hybrid mixed.  Hybrid  web  are  the  kind  of  applications  discussed  throughout  this   chapter. Hybrid mixed applications are simply extensions of hybrid web   applications.  They  also  include  additional  native  code.  For  example,  an  organization  might  decide  that  their  hybrid  mobile  application  should  allow for near field communication  NFC . When they attempt to incorpo- rate the  functionality, they discover that their hybrid framework does not         172  Mobile Electronic Commerce  yet support NFC. Instead of relying on the framework, the organization  goes ahead and custom codes a native solution that is then integrated into  their hybrid application and a hybrid mixed application is created. Since  the new functionality was written in native code, the resulting application  becomes less portable and requires additional development time if ported  to run on additional operating systems.  WorkLight understands that the different mobile application require- ments  that  surround  each  organization  are  unique.  Their  product  pro- vides  a  development  environment  for  each  of  the  mobile  application  architectures  including  mobile  web  and  full  native  development.  This  development flexibility paired with their IBM support model should make  WorkLight a serious development tool consideration for any organization  entering the mobile application development landscape.  9.5.4  Appcelerator Founded  in  2006,  Appcelerator  is  a  company  that  focuses  on  powering  their clients with tools to author innovative and intuitive mobile applica- tions that can be deployed to multiple devices from a single code base.  Their  client  list  is  impressive  and  includes  organizations  such  as  NBC,  eBay, CISCO, ING, and Reuters. Operating as a full service mobile devel- opment organization, Appcelerator offers a wide array of products such as  their flagship product Titanium Mobile, their development environment  Titanium Studio, Titanium Analytics, and Titanium Desktop.  Like other hybrid mobile application frameworks, Appcelerator allows  developers who use their software tools to write application code in stan- dard  web-based  languages.  When  completed,  the  application  is  then  packaged to be deployed on a variety of mobile device platforms. There  have been some concerns raised by potential customers and developers  that users of the Appcelerator software will have to learn the Titanium  API in addition to the unique set of Appcelerator processes.  9.6  Future of hybrid mobile applications The future of hybrid mobile applications is bright. Organizations have  quickly  learned  that  native  development  is  time  consuming,  highly  fragmented, and costly. It is likely that strict native application develop- ment will be left entirely to those applications that require significant  performance  capability  such  as  immersive  mobile  gaming  applica- tions and applications requiring acute graphical interfaces. At the same  time, hybrid mobile applications that rely heavily on standardized web  technologies,  native  integration,  and  portability  are  going  to  garner         Chapter nine:  Enhancing electronic commerce  173  increased attention from organizational decision makers and  developers   Ko, 2013; Nenava and Choudhary, 2013 .  The  future  of  hybrid  mobile  applications  is  not  solely  hinged  on  technology  adoption  and  feature  development.  Mobile  application  development as a whole is also largely influenced by economic factors.  Paid  applications  and  advertising  revenue  are  a  driving  force  behind  mobile  applications.  Hybrid’s  emergence  onto  the  application  land- scape is sure to raise a few eyebrows. Apple was the first on the scene  with its revolutionary application development platform and delivery  channel  West and Mace, 2010 . Google soon followed with their Apps  Marketplace. Both Apple and Google have proven that there is signif- icant  money  to  be  made  in  the  mobile  space  and  they  are  not  likely  to  leave  the  economics  to  chance.  One  of  the  key  characteristics  of  a  hybrid mobile application is its use of HTML5 technologies. Therefore,  the success of hybrid mobile applications is loosely coupled to the over- all  adoption  and  success  of  HTML5.  All  indications  point  to  HTML5  becoming an even more significant player in the future of web develop- ment  Nixon, 2011; Ko, 2013 .  There  are  some  technology  experts  who  believe  that  eventually  HTML5  mobile  web  apps  will  replace  both  native  and  hybrid  applica- tions as the de facto mobile application architecture  Gavalas et al., 2011;  Fu et al., 2013; Ko, 2013 . Browsers, both mobile and desktop, would have  to create APIs for a standardized manner. Thus, web pages could commu- nicate to the devices that they are operating on to get specific information.  For  example,  a  web  page  running  on  a  mobile  device  might  be  able  to  access the devices camera and include a photo in the site. We have already  seen some of this technology shift occurring in browsers. Many of them  have  begun  to  make  available  geo-location  services  and  APIs  with  the  caveat that the application user must knowingly allow this information to  be shared  Haklay et al., 2008; Soutschek, 2010 .  It is likely a matter of time that leading-edge browsers such as Google  Chrome will begin to make other device APIs available to users and web  developers   Charland  and  Leroux,  2011 .  As  the  list  of  available  APIs  grows, it is predicted that at some point developers will become less reli- ant  on  native  and  hybrid  dependencies  and  be  able  to  develop  entirely  for the browser. In reality, browser technology is notorious for their slow  response to emerging technologies. As new advances in device features  enter the market, they become available to native and hybrid applications  much  sooner  than  the  browser  developers  are  able  to  implement  their  APIs. For this reason alone, it is expected that hybrid mobile architecture  will  be  relevant  to  mobile  application  development  in  electronic  com- merce for the foreseeable future.        174  Mobile Electronic Commerce  9.7  Conclusion After examining the research available on hybrid mobile architecture and  the growth of hybrid mobile application development, we categorize two  specific findings immediately illustrated in the forefront. The first find- ing  is  that  the  hybrid  mobile  architecture  is  probably  the  right  mobile   application  architecture  for  most  mobile  application  projects  exclud- ing  performance  centric  games   Edoh-Alove  et  al.,  2013 .  Most  mobile   application requirements that an organization would likely include can  be  fulfilled  through  the  use  of  the  hybrid  architecture.  These  hybrid  mobile   applications  are  quicker  to  develop,  can  be  deployed  to  multi- ple  platforms, have a low TCO, offer more staffing options, and deliver  comparable  performance.  The  first  finding  points  out  that  the  hybrid   architecture  is  becoming  the  intelligent  choice  for  organizations  to  develop mobile applications.  The  second  finding  is  centered  on  the  idea  that  while  the  hybrid  mobile architecture is currently viewed as an innovative and progressive  technology, it is simply a necessary progression of the mobile application  evolution.  Hybrid  mobile  applications  are,  by  design,  a  combination  of  two established technology platforms. The hybrid architecture is strongly  coupled  and  is  dependent  on  external  technologies  beyond  its  control.  This makes the hybrid architecture volatile and likely to experience sig- nificant changes as the mobile application landscape shifts to determine  its technological winners and losers.  When  the  mobile  market,  developers,  and  organizations  choose  the  industry  platform  that  will  drive  electronic  commerce,  the  hybrid  mobile application development architecture apparently provides a plat- form for the next generation of mobile application innovation. As seen  in  the  fast  change  in  other  application  development  methodologies  in  various fields, the hybrid mobile architecture is simply a stopgap in the  evolution of mobile application architecture. The industry will come up  with new architectures to meet the demand of the dynamic electronic  commerce market.  There  are  numerous  potential  opportunities  for  future  research  in  the mobile application architecture spectrum. A few interesting research   topics  might  include  surveying  both  users  and  organizations  for  their  feedback on how a chosen hybrid application performs in comparison to  a similar native or mobile web application. It would be also interesting  to determine some high-level savings estimates that organizations reap  from  switching  to  hybrid  mobile  development.  Results  from  empirical  studies of various mobile application development architectures such as  quantitative analyses of savings and TCOs could help organization’s deci- sion making in choosing appropriate infrastructure and architecture. This  chapter  analyzes  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  hybrid  method         Chapter nine:  Enhancing electronic commerce  175  with several practical business cases. Researchers and practitioners can  use them as a set of guidelines to develop research framework as well as  adoption of the hybrid mobile architecture.  References Angel,  K.D.   2011 .

He specified that he would  like  his  business  application  to  run  on  multiple  platforms:  Android*   phones  and  tablets ,  iOS†   iPhone,  iPad ,  and  perhaps  Windows  8‡  as  well. At the time, I had been teaching Android and Windows 8 applica- tion development courses extensively. Contemplating my friend’s request,  I realized that pursuing what I had been teaching my students would lead  me  to  have  to  learn  Objective-C§  for  development  on  the  iOS  platform.   *  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Android_ operating_system . †  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki IOS. ‡  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Windows_8. §  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Objective-C.  177   178  Mobile Electronic Commerce  It  would  also  mean  that  I  would  need  to  use  three  different  platforms  for development: Eclipse* for Android, Visual Studio† for Windows, and  Cocoa Touch‡ for iOS. Furthermore, I would have to maintain several dif- ferent code bases for the application, one for each of the platforms that  could lead to many issues in developing applications that would have the  same appearance, have the same functionality, and can be easily main- tained. I needed a better solution. First challenge: choosing the develop- ment platform.  10.2  Nitobi In April 2009, an Internet start-up, Nitobi Software,§ was launched to cre- ate rich web applications and developer toolkits in Ajax and JavaScript.  The  company  produced  a  product,  PhoneGap,¶  a  developer  package  that enables developers to create mobile web applications. PhoneGap is  an open source platform that allows developers to build cross-platform  mobile  applications  with  HTML5  and  JavaScript,  and  distribute  these  applications to a variety of platforms. By using HTML5 and JavaScript,  Nitobi eliminated the need for creating specific applications for different  mobile and tablet platforms.  In  October  2011,  Nitobi  Software  was  acquired  by  Adobe.**  Under  Adobe  stewardship,  PhoneGap  was  separated  from  its  underlying  soft- ware  which  was  named  Apache  Cordova  and  submitted  as  an  incuba- tion project to the Apache Foundation.†† In October 2012, Apache Cordova  graduated  to  become  a  top-level  project  within  the  Apache  Software  Foundation  ASF .‡‡ In a March 2012 blog, Brian Leroux explained the dif- ference between PhoneGap and Apache Cordova:  PhoneGap  is  a  distribution  of  Apache  Cordova.  You  can  think  of  Apache  Cordova  as  the  engine  that  powers  PhoneGap,  similar  to  how  WebKit  is  the engine that powers Chrome or Safari.  Browser  geeks, please allow me the affordance of this anal- ogy and I’ll buy you a beer later.   *  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Eclipse_ software . †  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Visual_Studio. ‡  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Cocoa_Touch. §  http:  www.crunchbase.com company nitobi-software. ¶  http:  phonegap.com . ** http:  techcrunch.com 2011 10 03 adobe-acquires-developer-of-html5-mobile-app-  framework-phonegap-nitobi .  †† http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Apache_Cordova. ‡‡ http:  cordova.apache.org about.        Chapter ten:  Using the Apache Cordova open source platform  179  Over time, the PhoneGap distribution may contain  additional tools that tie into other Adobe services,  which  would  not  be  appropriate  for  an  Apache  project.  For  example,  PhoneGap  Build  and  Adobe  Shadow  together  make  a  whole  lot  of  strategic  sense.  PhoneGap  will  always  remain  free,  open  source software and will always be a free distribu- tion of Apache Cordova.*  10.3  Apache Cordova Apache  Cordova  is  an  open  source  platform  for  building  native  cross- platform mobile applications using HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript, thus  avoiding  each  mobile  platforms’  native  development  language.  Apache  Cordova facilitates packaging and deployment of mobile applications as  native applications on the target platform. On each target platform, mobile  applications  execute  within  wrappers  and  rely  on  standards-compliant  application  programming  interface   API   bindings  to  access  a  device’s  sensors, data, and network status. Mobile applications are rendered by the  web engine of the target machine: WebKit† for Apple’s Safari and Google’s  Chrome as well as Trident‡ for Internet Explorer.  The Cordova documentation has detailed information about the APIs  and how to use them.§ Apache Cordova provides support for most mobile  device  features  including  Accelerometer,  Camera,  Capture,  Compass,  Connection,  Contacts,  Device,  Events,  File,  Geolocation,  Globalization,  InAppBrowser, Media, Notification, Splashscreen, and Storage.  Apache  Cordova  has  different  levels  of  support  for  the  various   platforms¶:     The platforms that are fully supported by the Apache Cordova proj- ect are iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Phone, and Windows 8.  The support consists of a standard low-level native plug-in bridge  API  and related utilities .     The platforms that are currently partially supported by the Apache  Cordova project  but may be upgraded to full support at a later date   are Tizen, Qt, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Mobile  Qt , and Windows  Win32 .    The  platforms  that  are  being  retired  from  support  by  the  Apache   Cordova project are Symbian, webOS, and Bada.  *  http:  phonegap.com 2012 03 19 phonegap-cordova-and-what%E2%80%99s-in-a-name . †  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki WebKit. ‡  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Trident_ layout_engine . §  http:  cordova.apache.org docs en 3.1.0 guide_overview_index.md.htmlOverview. ¶  http:  wiki.apache.org cordova PlatformSupport.        180  Mobile Electronic Commerce  10.4  PhoneGap PhoneGap is an open source free distribution of Apache Cordova.* Since  PhoneGap  is  free,  developers  and  companies  can  use  PhoneGap  for  mobile applications that are free, commercial, open source, or any com- bination  of  these.  The  PhoneGap  implementation  provides  a  different  set  then  the  Apache  Cordova  supported  API:  Accelerometer,  Camera,  Compass,  Contacts,  File,  Geolocation,  Media,  Network,  Notification   Alert , Notification  Sound , Notification  Vibration , and Storage. In gen- eral, PhoneGap extends the Apache Cordova API by having more detailed  notification capabilities.  PhoneGap  is  an  HTML  5  application  platform  that  allows  develop- ers to author native applications with web technologies and get access to  APIs and app stores. Applications are built as normal HTML pages and  packaged to run as a native application within a UIWebView or WebView   a chromeless browser, referred to hereafter as a webview .  10.5  Status check The discovery of Apache Cordova and PhoneGap brought us closer to our  goal of creating a platform agnostic native mobile application based on  open source standards. Table 10.1 shows that Apache Cordova or its imple- mentation PhoneGap has solved part of the framework for creating native  mobile applications that can run on any platform.  Table  10.1  also  shows  that  the  selection  of  Apache  Cordova  or  PhoneGap  still  leaves  two  issues  unresolved:  A  unified  user  interface  library and a development environment.  Building a ubiquitous native mobile application can be facilitated if a  user interface library can be identified that addresses several requirements:     The library should be built on top of JavaScript.    The  library  should  support  rendering  on  all  iOS,  Android,  and   Windows 8 platforms.  Table 10.1  Framework for Creating Native   Agnostic Mobile Applications  User interface   Development environment User interface library  Apache Cordova or PhoneGap HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript WebKit or Trident Mobile Devices  *  http:  phonegap.com about faq .        Chapter ten:  Using the Apache Cordova open source platform  181  Default.html Home.html  Default.html Page2.html  Figure 10.1  SPA navigation.     The library should provide a single-page application  SPA * frame- work. SPA is a mobile application that fits on a single view with the  goal of providing a fluid user experience. In an SPA, either all neces- sary code—HTML, JavaScript, and CSS—is retrieved with a single  page  load,  or  the  appropriate  views  are  dynamically  loaded  and  added to the page as necessary as shown in Figure 10.1.     Since the basic platform for developing ubiquitous mobile applica- tions is based on HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript, it is important to  have  a  clear  separation  of  the  development  of  the  graphical  user  interface  View  from the development of the business logic or back- end  logic   Model   and  the  components  that  mediate  between  the  View  and  the  Model   View–Model .  The  Model–View–ViewModel   MVVM † is a design pattern that enhances the development experi- ence by creating applications that are maintainable.  The  second  component  that  is  missing  from  the  mobile  development  framework  is  a  developer  friendly  development  environment.  Both  Apache  Cordova  and  PhoneGap  utilize  a  command-line  interface   CLI   to create the mobile applications and to deploy them to the various native  mobile platforms. The CLI allows developers to create new projects, build  them on different platforms, and run them within an emulator. From a  developer productivity perspective, the CLI is insufficient. In addition, the  development environment must provide emulation capabilities for all the  mobile platforms to facilitate testing of ubiquitous native mobile applica- tions on the various mobile platforms.  10.6  User interface libraries Throughout this research, the focus has been on setting up an open source  framework for developing ubiquitous mobile applications. A list of candi- date open source libraries that can run on multiple native platforms are  described next.  *  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Single_page_application. †  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Model_View_ViewModel.        182  Mobile Electronic Commerce  jQuery Mobile  10.6.1  jQuery  Mobile  is  based  on  jQuery,  which  is  a  multibrowser  JavaScript  library  that  had  been  designed  to  simplify  the  client-side  scripting  of  HTML.* jQuery is a free, open source software that facilitates the selec- tion of Document Object Model  DOM  elements and their manipulation  using by jQuery’s selector engine  Sizzle . The jQuery development effort  is  marshaled  by  a  nonprofit  organization  the  jQuery  Foundation.†  The  jQuery Foundation is also responsible for coordinating the efforts behind  the development of jQueryUI and jQuery Mobile.  jQuery Mobile is a unified, HTML5-based user interface system for  all  popular  mobile  device  platforms,  built  on  the  jQuery  and  founda- tion.‡ jQuery Mobile supports all major mobile, tablet, e-reader & desk- top platforms—iOS, Android, Blackberry, Palm WebOS, Nokia Symbian,  Windows Phone 7, MeeGo, Opera Mobile Mini, Firefox Mobile, Kindle,  Nook, and all modern browsers with graded levels of support.  The jQuery Mobile page structure is optimized to support either sin- gle pages, or local internal linked pages within a page, which satisfies a  requirement  that  was  specified  earlier.  In  addition,  jQuery  Mobile  sup- ports building native mobile platform applications using the PhoneGap  implementation of Apache Cordova.  Finally,  mobile  applications  can  be  structured  as  MVVM  with  a  proper separation between the UI design  View , the code that interacts  with the backend  Model , and the interactions between the View and the  Model  View–Model .  Table 10.2 shows the open source framework for building ubiquitous   mobile web applications.  The last issue remaining is a developer-friendly development environ- ment. While jQuery Mobile does not provide a development environment  it does provide a tool called download builder, which lets a developer create   Table 10.2  Revised Framework for Creating Native   Agnostic Mobile Applications  Development environment  User interface   jQuery Mobile Apache Cordova or PhoneGap HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript WebKit or Trident Mobile Devices  *  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki JQuery. †  https:  jquery.org . ‡  http:  jquerymobile.com .

In addition, there is a new plug-in for JDST that adds  jQuery auto-completion support to JavaScript project.§ Eclipse, however,  does not include emulators for the various mobile platforms. Some emu- lators, such as Android, can be added by installing the Android software  development kit  SDK , but there is no complete emulation capability.  There are two additional notable libraries that offer comparable capa- bilities, a software development environment, and more complete emula- tion capabilities  Table 10.3 .  *  http:  eclipse.org . †  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Eclipse_ software . ‡  http:  eclipse.org webtools jsdt . §  http:  marketplace.eclipse.org content jsdt-jquery.Ulcgh1AgcaR.        184  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Table 10.3  Framework for Creating Native Agnostic Mobile   Applications with Limited Emulation  Eclipse  User interface   jQuery Mobile Apache Cordova or PhoneGap HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript WebKit or Trident Mobile Devices  10.6.2  KendoUI The KendoUI JavaScript library allows developers to create mobile appli- cations  that  offer  native-like  experiences  for  end  users  automatically,  without any extra coding.* KendoUI supports development for the follow- ing mobile platforms: Windows Phone 8, iOS, Android, and Blackberry.  In addition, KendoUI integrates with Apache Cordova to provide native  application  packaging  and  deployment  to  the  various  mobile  devices.  KendoUI is utilized in the Icenium IDE to facilitate cross-platform mobile  application development and emulation.† Icenium provides complete sup- port for Apache Cordova to facilitate the creation of native mobile appli- cation  packages  and  deployment.  Icenium  is  available  in  two  versions:  Graphite, a stand-alone Windows desktop version, and Mist, a web-based  development environment. Figure 10.3 shows the Graphite development  environment with a sample project—Tip Calculator.

Figure 10.4 shows a side-by-side simulation of the Icenium for the iPhone  and Android mobile devices, respectively.  Table 10.4 shows the development framework with the Icenium IDE   and the KendoUI API.  There are two main drawbacks with the Icenium KendoUI solution:  it costs money and it is not open source that diminishes the likelihood  that it will ever become a standard.  10.6.3  Sencha Touch Sencha Touch is an alternative framework  API  for building mobile web  applications.*  Sencha  Touch  integrates  with  either  Apache  Cordova  or  PhoneGap  to  provide  native  mobile  application  packaging  and  deploy- ment. Eclipse is the IDE used for Sencha Touch and the Eclipse Add-In  provides emulators for most mobile device platforms. Table 10.5 shows the  development framework with the Eclipse IDE and Sencha Touch.  *  http:  www.sencha.com products touch .        186  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Eclipse  Table 10.5  Sencha Touch Stack  User interface   Sencha Touch Apache Cordorva or PhoneGap HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript WebKit or Trident Mobile Devices  Like  the  KendoUI  solution,  Sencha  Touch  has  the  same  two  draw-  backs: price and a proprietary API framework.  There are many other Mobile UI libraries, but they all have to be inte- grated into a third-party IDE and they do not provide complete simula- tion emulation capabilities.  The choice is clear: a developer can either choose a free open source  solution  with  limited  emulation simulation  capability  or  a  proprietary  solution with full emulation simulation capability.  10.7  Additional considerations Experience  shows  that  developing  a  ubiquitous  native  mobile  applica- tion will generally require a website that users can access with the same  capabilities. Since our three proposed solutions are built on the HTML 5,  CSS 3, and JavaScript components, all three solutions can be utilized to  create a web application with the same capabilities.  Finally,  most  business  mobile  applications  will  require  access  to  backend data. Backend can be accessible either through proprietary web  services   private  cloud   or  through  a  public  cloud  implementation.  Of  the  three  solutions  proposed,  the  Icenium KendoUI  solution  integrates  with its own cloud data storage—Everlive.* Figure 10.5 shows the revised  Icenium KendoUI stack.  One last consideration: How difficult is it to set up the software devel- opment environment? This is a very subjective measure and after setting  up all three solutions, the following ranking from easy to difficult is based  on the author’s experience: Icenium, Sencha Touch, and jQuery Mobile.  10.8  Concluding remarks All  three  solution  stacks  utilize  either  the  Apache  Cordova  or  the  PhoneGap  component  in  their  stack,  and  therefore,  all  three  solutions  will yield a native mobile application that can be packaged and deployed  through the corresponding vendor stores or enterprise deployments. All  three solutions will also yield a similar application look and feel. All three   *  http:  www.icenium.com product everlive.

The  open  source solution will have less emulation capabilities than the two propri- etary solutions. Having worked with all three solutions they are all some- what buggy and have not yet sufficiently matured to yield bullet-proof  native business mobile applications.  As far as helping my friend, the Icenium KendoUI Everlive stack was  chosen, since it was the easiest development platform to install and it also  provides easy access to cloud storage for storing the application data.  In  the  future,  additional  challenges  need  to  be  addressed.  One  of  these challenges is how to manage the state of the mobile application, so  that when users switch from one mobile device to another device run- ning on a different mobile platform, the users can continue their work  seamlessly.

Banks have competitively introduced new technolo- gies to make these financial transactions more hassle free and user-friendly.  Today, most financial institutions, including banks, provide services to sat- isfy their customers’ needs and continuously introduce new services.  Thus,  information  and  communication  technologies  play  a  vital  role in the financial and banking industry. During the last two decades,  researchers  and  developers  have  applied  information  and  communica- tion  technology  concepts  to  introduce  smart  solutions  for  the  banking  industry. The e-commerce concept has been introduced as an alternative  to traditional methods. Examples of such solutions are automated teller  machine  ATM  services, credit card debit card services, and online pay- ment systems.  With  the  rapid  enhancement  and  popularity  of  mobile  technologies,  banking institutions try to go beyond the e-commerce applications by intro- ducing  mobile  commerce.  This  opens  up  a  new  arena  for  electronic  bank- ing. It is one of the newest approaches to the provision of financial services  through the wireless network, which has been made possible by the wide- spread adoption of mobile phones everywhere. The process involves the use  of mobile devices to perform various financial transactions either directly  with  the  recipient   micropayments   or  indirectly  via  a  customer’s  bank  account.  The  functional  capabilities  of  mobile  telephony  have  been  rapid  and have extended operations well beyond classical applications  telephone  calls and short messaging . There is mounting evidence of positive finan- cial, economic, and social impact of those technologies all over the world.  Remarkably, in most countries, the mobile telecommunication sector  has  achieved  rapid  expansion  [1]  in  recent  years.  Therefore,  the  mobile  communication  infrastructure  can  be  used  as  a  good  deployment  plat- form for the electronic base of banking and financial systems.  Given these capabilities, the most important consideration regarding  such transactions is the issue of security. Mobile networks are based on  the use of poorly secured wireless protocols. This makes mobile financial  applications even more vulnerable to fraud and illegal use than similar  transactions performed over open networks. Therefore, one of the main  prerequisites  for  successful,  large-scale  deployment  of  mobile  financial  services applications is their security.  11.1.1  Related works The  first  electronic  wallet  CAFÉ,  which  contains  digital  currency,  was  introduced in 1994 [2]. It was a pocket-sized workstation that lets users  undertake cash payments electronically. The CAFÉ [2] electronic wallet         Chapter eleven:  MobiCash  191  prototype  transacts  via  a  short-range  infrared  link  either  directly  with  compliant cash registers or over computer networks, such as Internet, to  merchants’ tills and service points provided by banks. They proposed this  as an off-line electronic wallet. The rationale for denoting the CAFÉ as  off-line is because mobile devices at that time lack embedded functional- ities for mobile online data communication. The system can use electronic  money stored in mobile phones to purchase from nominated merchants.  In 2003, CAFÉ has been modified as an online wallet [3]. This wallet con- sists of several modern communication channels to communicate the pay- ment details with merchants.  In the year 2000, SMART  mobile phone–based payment system  [3]  has  been  introduced  and  SMART  Money  coupled  a  customer’s  mobile  phone  with  his  bank  account  [3].  It  facilitates  the  process  of  depositing  and withdrawing money from the bank account, filling prepaid mobile  phone  credits,  transferring  money  between  other  mobile  accounts,  and  bill payment. Although SMART facilitates several mobile banking func- tions, it uses electronic cash stored in the mobile phone as the transaction  medium.  Moreover,  near  field  communication  has  been  used  in  mobile  pay- ment systems [4]. The advantage of this system over other systems is that  it  does  not  require  high-cost  data  protection  security  protocols.  In  the  payment transaction path, a personal mobile phone is viewed as a single,  user-trusted  touch  point.  Compared  to  other  solutions  available,  this  approach protects user credentials, provides better user control over the  transaction, and supports only proximity transactions [4].  VTBN [5] is another example for m-commerce, which uses existing  mobile  infrastructure  to  perform  the  credit  card  transactions  securely.  Users can use their mobile phone as a credit card. The mobile phone syncs  with a credit card account maintained by a bank. From a data security  perspective, one of the major disadvantages of the traditional credit card  is the repetitive use of the same credit card number. The VTBN system is  designed to reduce the repetitive use of the fixed credit card number.  Furthermore, we have studied mobile commerce systems similar to  the systems we have described. Most of the systems provide similar func- tionalities. Due to space constraints, we do not discuss those here.  11.1.2  Problem description Numbers of commercial systems are available for enabling banking services  on mobile devices. Most of these systems are based on the Global System for  Mobile  Communications   GSM   network  infrastructure  and  security  fea- tures provided by the GSM network [6,7].  The GSM system strives to make a provision for security services,  but  still  has  limitations  in  its  security.  Previous  studies  [8]  pointed         192  Mobile Electronic Commerce  out the lack of data integrity and confidentiality in the GSM network.  The  GSM  service  provider  has  control  over  the  data  flow  through  its  network.  This  is  the  most  critical  concern  regarding  the  deployment  of  mobile  banking  applications  on  GSM  networks.  A  highly  secured  mobile  banking  application  requires  end-to-end  secured  channels  for  data communication.  Moreover,  these  m-commerce  systems  use  only  electronic  financial  materials  such as electronic coins  for the transaction [9]. In developing  countries, most of the day-to-day transactions still happen by exchanging  physical currency [10], not electronic payments. Even in well-developed  countries, people still use coins and notes for day-to-day transactions.  Therefore, this research focuses on proposing a low-cost m-commerce  solution to withdraw money  physical currency  from the customer’s bank  account. We propose a money withdrawal deposit system  ATM system   that would allow people to perform their banking transactions based on  mobile technologies with additional security features.  11.1.3  Why we propose another ATM system? ATMs  play  an  increasingly  prominent  role  in  the  lifestyle  of  many  humans. Although it has several inherent weaknesses, at present there are  thousands of ATMs scattered throughout the world. Such growth reveals  that the ATM is a successful technology that has been adopted by many  people. The ATM is a pay-now payment system and is typically used for  microtransactions [11].  Even though the ATM is an extremely popular electronic transaction   system, it has several weaknesses.  ATM machines are not evenly scattered throughout different regions.  Therefore, some users have to travel a long distance to use ATM facilities.  In rural areas, the situation is worse.  The initial cost of installing ATMs is extraordinarily high. Also, ATMs  typically  connect  to  the  ATM  transaction  processor  securely,  via  either  a  dial-up  modem  over  a  public  telephone  line  or  directly  via  a  leased  line, which is expensive. In addition to that, banking organizations need  trained staff to maintain ATM devices. As a result, maintenance costs of  ATM machines are not economical.  Security,  as  it  relates  to  ATMs,  has  several  dimensions.  There  are  reports that ATMs have become targets for vandalism. Sometimes thieves  attempt to steal entire ATMs. Shoulder attack [12], a situation where a thief  will look over the user’s shoulder to identify the PIN number, is another  famous security threat related to ATMs. In order to protect ATMs from  these threats, a security guard needs to be employed for every ATM. Both  banks and ATM customers face lots of problems related to the use of ATMs.        Chapter eleven:  MobiCash  193  The proposed system is designed in such a way that it can solve most  of these problems and enhance the security of the transaction. Moreover,  the proposed system will reduce some of the barriers  long queues, ATM  machines not scattered everywhere  of using ATM network and improve  security related to ATM transactions.  11.2  MobiCash MobiCash is an m-commerce application, which provides the services of  ATM. In other words, MobiCash is an alternate to the ATM. The traditional  ATM network [11] can be replaced by the MobiCash system. Meanwhile,  MobiCash  enables  the  mobile  phone  to  be  used  as  a  debit  card,  which  allows access to customers’ bank accounts to make purchases.  The next section discusses the key consideration points, which moti-  vate us to design MobiCash system.  11.2.1  Mobile commerce It  is  increasingly  becoming  an  understatement  to  say  that  the  Internet  and related technologies are changing the ways people live. One of the  most significant changes promises to be in the way business is conducted.  M-commerce  is  one  of  these  relatively  new  technologies  using  mobile  Internet.  M-commerce  has  promised  to  revolutionize  online  financial  transactions and be more powerful than anything the ordinary Internet  has offered earlier.  Recent  research  on  mobile  technologies  introduces  new  services  to  fulfill the growing demand of mobility. In this context, mobile commerce  has a vital role to play. These types of applications services include buy- ing  over  the  mobile  phone,  purchasing  and  redeeming  of  tickets  and  reward schemes, accessing travel and weather information, and writing  contracts on the move [9].  Today,  there  is  a  tendency  to  provide  adequate  infrastructure  for  mobile  commerce  applications  on  a  mobile  network  layer.  This  trend  opens up huge business potential for mobile network operators. There is  a significant and growing demand for deploying banking and financial  services over mobile networks [10].  11.2.2  Strengths and weaknesses M-commerce applications are extremely useful for mobile users in several  ways [13]. Any user with a mobile phone can access m-commerce appli- cations in real time at any place. Also, the mobile devices provide more  security to a certain extent over online transaction systems [14,15].        194  Mobile Electronic Commerce  However, there are limitations to mobile devices, as most devices are  equipped  with  limited  memory,  display,  and  processing  power  [16].  In  addition to that, the communication through the open air links introduces  additional security threats  e.g., eavesdropping .  The security challenge related to mobile commerce is not limited to  the  mobile  devices,  but  is  interconnected  with  the  radio  interface,  the  network  operator  infrastructure,  and  the  nature  of  mobile  commerce   application [17].  In m-commerce applications, each party that participates for a par- ticular  transaction  does  not  meet  each  other  physically.  However,  in  financial  transactions,  trust  should  somehow  be  established  between  each party [16].  General cryptography concepts can be used to accomplish the trust   between each participant [10]. These include the following:  Authentication: Authentication is the process of proving user identifica- tion. Authentication in the m-commerce environment is performed  successfully  through  public-key  cryptographic  systems  incorpo- rated into public-key infrastructures  PKIs . In fact, the primary goal  of authentication in a PKI is to support the remote and unambigu- ous authentication between entities unknown to each other, using  public-key certificates and CA trust hierarchies.  Integrity: Integrity means ensuring that data cannot be modified and  transactions  cannot  be  altered.  Public-key  certificates  and  digital  signature envelopes are good in assurance of integrity. Public-key  cryptography is typically used in conjunction with a hashing algo- rithm such as SHA-1 or MD5 to provide integrity.  Confidentiality:  Confidentiality  means  ensuring  the  secrecy  and  pri- vacy of data. With guaranteed confidentiality of data, customers can  assure that sensitive data have not been altered by the third party.  Nonrepudiation:  Nonrepudiation  means  ensuring  that  data  cannot  be  renounced  or  a  transaction  denied.  This  is  provided  through  public-key  cryptography  by  digital  signing.  Nonrepudiation  is  a  critical  security  service  of  any  e-commerce  application  where  value  exchanges,  legal,  or  contractual  obligations  are  negotiated.  Nonrepudiation is a by-product of using public-key cryptography.  When data are cryptographically signed using the private key of a  key pair, anyone who has access to the public key of that pair can  determine  that  only  the  owner  of  the  key  pair  itself  could  have  signed the data in question.  PKI has been used to implement the earlier-described security features.   Here, we present brief description of PKI in domain of MobiCash.        Chapter eleven:  MobiCash  195  11.2.3  Public-key infrastructure  PKI  Public-key  cryptosystem  has  been  designed  to  securely  communicate  between two parties without a preagreed secret key. Each party does not  need  to  have  a  secret  key  exchange  mechanism  before  starting  secure  communication.  The  setup  for  a  public-key  cryptosystem  is  of  a  network  of  users   u1,…, un rather than a single pair of users.  Each user u in the network has a pair of keys Pu, Su associated with  him, the public key Pu, which is published under a public directory acces- sible for everyone to read, and the private key Su, which is known abso- lutely only to u.  Let  A  and  B  be  two  users  where  A  needs  to  securely  communicate  message m to B. To send a secret message “m” to B, A uses the same exact  method, which involves looking up Pu, computing E Pu, m  where E is a  public encryption algorithm, and sending the resulting cipher text “c” to B. Upon receiving cipher text c, user B can decrypt by looking up his  private  key  Su  and  computing  D Su,  c   where  D  is  a  public  decryption  algorithm.  The operation of each individual key is a one-way operation: a key  cannot be used to reverse its operation. In addition, the algorithms used  by both keys are designed so that a key cannot be used to determine the  opposite key in the pair. Thus, the private key cannot be determined from  the public key.  11.2.4  Digital certificates Digital certificates allow someone to combine their digital signature with  a public key and something that identifies them, an example being their  real life name. This certificate is used to allow computer mobile users to  show that they do own the public keys they claim to [18]. In other words,  it is a security mechanism for public keys.  As mentioned earlier, a digital signature is required for the PKI cer- tificate.  This  signature  can  either  be  made  by  an  authority  figure  who  assigns the certificates, the person whose identity is being confirmed, or  even endorsers of the public key.  As with electronic financial transactions, a digital signature is a way  for other parties and people to verify that a person is in fact the owner of  the public key they claim is their own. Furthermore, the PKI certificates  allow other people to verify that they are indeed communicating with the  right person and using the right public key.  In the proposed system, we utilize the properties of PKI certificates to  provide the essential security features for electronic financial transactions.        196  Mobile Electronic Commerce  11.2.5  System design The key components of the anticipated system are bank, customer, and  the MobiCash agent. The roles of these components will be discussed later  in this chapter. Both the MobiCash agent and the customer should have  mobile phones, suitably modified to perform the MobiCash functions. In  the case of use as a debit card, the merchant will replace the role of the  MobiCash agent. The bank has a MobiCash server as the front end, con- nected to the bank’s back-end transaction management system.  The proposed system is built on PKI cryptography. Therefore, before  subscribing to the system, all participants should complete two steps of  the user verification process as follows:       1. User registration process 2. Certificate issuing process  All the functions of the MobiCash system work on the information gath- ered  from  the  aforementioned  steps.  Details  of  the  two  processes  are  defined next.  11.2.5.1  User registration  The registration process is for the collection and verification of the user’s  information relevant to MobiCash system, such as bank account details.  This registration process should be completed as a face-to-face procedure.  Each user should be present at a registration desk for the one-time process. The registration process should be performed by a trusted registra- tion agent. This trusted registration process can be performed by the bank  or other independent identification provider. We suggest an independent  identification provider for this task. If all the banks trust the same third- party  identification  provider,  the  system  can  be  used  for  interbanking  transactions. Therefore, we recommend a central bank or other respon- sible government authorities to perform registration process. Figure 11.1  illustrates the registration process.  All information gathered in the registration process is stored securely   in a database for user authentication.  11.2.5.2  Certification issuing process  The proposed MobiCash system uses the PKI to enable the security for  transactions. Therefore, all the participants who are involved with a par- ticular transaction should have PKI security certificates. The certification  authority has the right to issue these certificates, based on the user reg- istration  information  gathered  from  the  user  registration  process.  The  certificate  issuing  authority  collaborates  with  the  registration  author- ity to get the user information. Bank can act as a certification authority.  If an external, trusted third-party certification authority is appointed to         Chapter eleven:  MobiCash  197  Customer  MobiCash  agent  Issue P certificate  Kl  MobiCash  server  c e r t i fi c a t e  I s s u e   P K  l  Issue PKl certificate  User info  Registration database  PKI CA server  Certification  manager  Figure 11.1  User registration process.

This  certificate  includes  the  user’s  private  key,  public  key,  and digital signature and personal identification information. Figure 11.2  illustrates the certification issuing process.  The certificate provided by the certification authority  CA  server is  stored  in  the  user’s  and  MobiCash  agent’s  mobile  phone  [19].  Thus,  the  security of all the transactions relies on the public-key cryptography.  After a reliable and verifiable registration and certification issuance,   an instance of the system is ready for secure transactions.        198  Mobile Electronic Commerce  11.3  Cash dispensing One  distinguishing  feature  of  the  proposed  system  is  the  way  it  dis- penses  cash  among  users.  The  cash  dispensing  happens  through  mobile cash dispensing agents. They dispense cash to customers upon  receipt  of  the  authorization  messages  from  banks  based  on  customer  cash requests. The sequence of steps and exchange of messages for the  cash dispensing is described later. We will discuss the security features  related to each step in Section 11.4. Figure 11.3 illustrates the overall sys- tem architecture.           1. Customer goes to a Mobile-ATM agent’s place and sends a secure  SMS to the bank  withdrawal request  including MobiCash agent’s  phone number and requested amount.  2. MobiCash server authenticates the user using PKI certificate chains   support of CA server and registration server.  3.

At the same time, the bank sends a payment authorization SMS to  the MobiCash agent together with a transaction number  a random  number  is  different  from  the  confirmation  number,  but  these  two  numbers are mathematically related to each other .  5. Customer discloses the confirmation number to the MobiCash agent. 6. MobiCash agent sends a confirmation SMS to the bank together with   the transaction and the confirmation number.  7. Bank  transfers  the  amount  from  the  customer’s  account  to  the  MobiCash  agent’s  account  and  sends  a  transaction  confirmation  SMS to the MobiCash agent.  8. Bank also sends a transaction confirmation SMS to the customer. 9. MobiCash agent gives the money to the customer.  11.3.1  System roles The operations of the system can be divided into three parts based on the  actors in the system:  Customer: Customer is a person who needs to perform an ATM trans- action.  He  has  a  bank  account  and  mobile  phone.  A  special  pro- gram should be installed in the customer’s mobile phone to operate  MobiCash functions.  MobiCash Agent: Like the customer, the MobiCash agent  Mobile-ATM  agent  must have a bank account and a mobile phone. This mobile  phone  is  also  modified  to  perform  functions  of  MobiCash  in  a  secured manner. He is authorized by the bank to perform MobiCash  transactions. The MobiCash agent keeps money on hand to give to  the customer when there is a request for such service.  Bank  Organization:  The  bank  should  have  MobiCash  servers  to  deal  with transactions between customers and MobiCash agents. These  MobiCash servers should directly connect to the bank’s databases.  In addition, the bank maintains the accounts of both the customer  and the MobiCash agent. Furthermore, bank servers have connec- tions with registration servers and CA servers to revoke certificates  or verify user information.  11.3.2  System deployment All  the  components  involved  with  a  transaction  must  register  in  advance. After completion of the registration process, each participant  receives a PKI X.509 certificate. On the customer side, there is a special  mobile application, suitable to operate the MobiCash functions. The cus- tomer certificate also has to be stored in the customer’s mobile phone.         200  Mobile Electronic Commerce  The application requires the customer’s PIN number  which is received  in  the  registration  process   for  authentication  purposes.  Moreover,  the  application requires the MobiCash agent’s mobile phone number and the  amount of money to be withdrawn. Finally, the customer-side applica- tion sends a secure SMS  which is encrypted by both the bank’s public  key and customer’s private key  to the bank with the MobiCash agent’s  mobile number, the amount of money to withdraw and the customer’s  account number.  On the MobiCash agent’s side, there should be a mobile application  that is capable of receiving secured SMS from the bank. A certificate is also  stored in the agent’s mobile phone, which should be able to securely send  a transaction completion notice and the customer’s mobile phone number  to  the  bank.  This  application  also  requires  the  agent’s  PIN  number  for  authentication  purposes.  Furthermore,  the  MobiCash  agent  generates  a  tracking number for audit purposes, indicates the transaction completion,  and sends the information to the MobiCash servers.  The MobiCash server provides an interface between the core bank- ing system and users. Meanwhile, it uses registration information to ver- ify the subscribers. The MobiCash servers are responsible for decrypting  customers’ agents’  messages  and  redirecting  the  messages  to  the  core  banking system. MobiCash servers encrypt the outgoing messages with  their own private key and the recipient’s public key. The MobiCash serv- ers are responsible for generating two random numbers  confirmation  number and transaction number  for every transaction. There is an algo- rithmic relationship between the confirmation number and the transac- tion number. A random number generation program will not generate  the same number for another transaction. After the sixth step, MobiCash  servers  are  able  to  identify  the  two  numbers  that  belong  to  the  same  transaction.  11.4  Security architecture We strongly assume here that the bank has concrete security policies on  how it internally handles access to its client details like PIN in its data- base  [17].  Here,  we  discuss  the  security  architecture  of  the  system  in   customer’s perspective and MobiCash agent’s perspective.  11.4.1  Customer-side security Customer-side security is based on asymmetric key cryptography, assum- ing that the bank is a trusted entity. From our earlier example, recall that  user A wants to withdraw money from his account. For money collection,  he selects Agent B.        Chapter eleven:  MobiCash  201  The customer has to enter his PIN number  α  to the customer-side  application,  and  the  application  itself  gets  the  customer  mobile  phone  number  β  and application ID  γ  to generate a secure Hash Code. Let H  be the hash string,    where h is the hash function algorithm.  H    h= α β γ  + +     Another hash code  H′  is generated using the aforementioned three  parameters and is stored in the phone’s SIM card at the very first run of  the mobile application. When a customer tries to log into the system, it  matches these two hash codes. If H = H′, the customer can log into the sys- tem [20]. The purpose of this hash function matching is to protect the user  from losing their individual information via mobile phone thefts.  Let us consider the following notations, which are used in rest of the   paper.  Bank public key Pb and private key Sb Agent public key Pa and private key Sa Customer public key Pc and private key Sc The withdrawal request includes the MobiCash agent’s phone num- ber, the customer’s phone number and the amount to be withdrawn. This  message  Wr  has been encrypted first from the bank’s public key and next  using the customer’s private key.  EW r E Sc E Pb W r  =   ,    ,       Next,  the  encrypted  version  of  information   EWr   is  sent  to  the  rele- vant bank [21]. According to the assumption mentioned earlier, first the  bank tries to decrypt the data using the bank’s private key. Let us name  this intermediate message as DWr′ ʹ =     If  DWr′  has  been  successfully  retrieved,  the  bank  knows  the  message  is  sent  by  a  registered  customer  and  not  tampered  [19],  because   EWr′   encrypted  with  Pb  and  Pb  is  known  only  by  the  bank.  Then  the  bank  retrieves the certificate belonging to the customer and retrieves the cus- tomer’s public key Sc and decrypts the intermediate message  DWr′  using  the customer’s public key  Pc .  D Sb EW r   ,    D W r  W r D Pc D W r    =   ,    If it is successful, the decryption process returns. Hence, the bank knows  the  message  comes  from  the  actual  customer,  who  needs  to  withdraw  money  from  his  account.  Next,  the  bank  generates  a  hash  code  of  the         202  Mobile Electronic Commerce  customer’s  PIN  number  and  mobile  phone  number  and  matches  that  against the hash code stored in the registration database. The stored hash  code is equal to H, hash string. The idea behind this hash code match- ing is to protect customers from using a fake phone number. The bank  can ensure that the correct person is using the mobile application, as only  the real user should know his PIN number. Thus, the system has been  designed in such a way so as to invalidate the transactions from stolen  mobile  phones,  so  that  a  bank  can  authenticate  the  customer.  Also,  an  encrypted version of the customer message provides the integrity and the  confidentiality of the customer information.  Bank sends two reply messages to customer: transaction authoriza- tion message  TA  and transaction completion message  Tc . Both the mes- sages are encrypted with bank’s private key and customer’s public key.  ETA E Pc E SB TA  =   ,    ,†      ETc E Pc E SB Tc  =   ,    ,†      Therefore, the customer can ensure the integrity and the confidentiality of  the information [22].  11.4.2  Agent-side security The MobiCash agent is a person authorized by the bank. The same secu- rity architecture described in previous section has been applied here.  At step 6 of Figure 11.3, the MobiCash agent encrypts the confirma- tion  number   c    which  has  been  obtained  from  the  customer   and  the  transaction number  t  received from the bank. The calculated hash code   ha  from the MobiCash agent’s PIN, the agent’s phone number, and the  application ID are also included in the message.  Let Ar be the request for payment approval from the agent. When the  MobiCash agent first registered, a hash code similar to Ha was stored in the  bank database, similar to the customer hash code. Then the bank can authen- ticate the MobiCash agent. The precalculated hash code is matched with the  hash code stored in the bank to prevent phone number faking attacks,  Ar h c t ha    + +     =  where Ar is the payment authorization request from the agent.    This message also provides the integrity and confidentiality of information.  EAr E Sa E Pb Ar  =   ,    ,                     Chapter eleven:  MobiCash  203  At steps 7 and 8 of Figure 11.3, the bank sends the confirmation note  that indicates whether the transaction was completed or rejected. These  two messages  Ma  =  Message  to  agent  and  Mc  =  Message  to  customer  are  encrypted by the bank. First, these messages are encrypted by the bank’s  private key and next by the agent’s customer’s public key.        EM a E Pa E Sb M a  =   ,    ,       EM c E Pc E Sb M c  =   ,    ,      If these messages are successfully decrypted on the receiving sides, the  customer and MobiCash agent can verify that the messages came from  the bank.  11.4.3  Nonrepudiation In the proposed protocols, nonrepudiation is ensured through the use of  the two random numbers  transaction number and confirmation number   generated by bank back-end servers [23]. The transaction number is sent  to the client. He has to disclose the transaction number to the MobiCash  agent. Then in step 6 of Figure 11.3, the MobiCash agent should send these  numbers to the bank again. If the two numbers are mathematically related  to each other, then it confirms to the corresponding client that he has dis- closed  the  correct  transaction  number  to  that  agent.  Thereafter,  the  cli- ent cannot deny participating in the transaction and ask to roll back the  transaction [9]. Besides ensuring nonrepudiation, the two random num- bers play an important role in preventing replay attacks.  11.4.4  Privacy Another  important  consideration  is  the  privacy  issues  of  the  financial  transactions. Most of the customers do not wish to disclose their financial  statements to outsiders. Although the customer does not need to disclose  his financial statement, unfortunately, due to the system design, the cus- tomer  needs  to  disclose  how  much  money  he  needs  to  withdraw.  This  problem may be a barrier to the popularity of the system, in the case of  deployment [24].  11.5  Evaluation So far, we have discussed the technical aspects designs and the specific  issues of the MobiCash system. This section introduces a detailed techni- cal evaluation and a small user study evaluation. MobiCash is a commu- nity-based  application.  Therefore,  community  acceptance  of  the  system         204  Mobile Electronic Commerce  is an important factor. We believe real-world evaluation has to be done to  evaluate the system instead of evaluating the system in a lab environment.  For evaluation purposes, we deployed the MobiCash system in a bank,  which has a customer community that is both urban and rural.  We have used 40 user samples for the evaluation. The  technical  evaluation  focuses  on  evaluating  the  system  perfor- mance  and  the  scalability.  The  performance  of  the  deployed  MobiCash  system has been measured by the time taken to complete a transaction.  The completion time of a transaction consists of the time needed to feed  the  data  to  the  application,  the  throughput  SMS  delivery  time,  and  the  time taken by the core banking system to complete the transaction. Thus,  the time taken to feed the data to the application also depends on the com- puter skill of the user. Therefore, we removed that factor to extract precise  measurements  about  the  system  performances.  For  a  transaction,  typi- cally there are two situations where users should feed data to the applica- tion: the withdrawal request and the agent’s request. Hence, we have to  divide time measurements into two parts.        1. Time  period  starting  from  the  customer  sending  the  withdrawal  request and ending with receiving both the confirmation SMS and  transaction SMS  T1   2. Time period starting from the agent sending the confirmation and  transaction  numbers  and  ending  with  receiving  the  transaction  completion SMS  T2   According to Table 11.1, standard deviation values of T1, T2, and total are  relatively small in comparison to the mean values. That means the spread- ing of T1, T2, and total time is in a short time interval. For example, the  bulk of the total completion times for transactions is between 84 and 104  s.  From  this,  we  can  conclude  that  the  system  is  stable  for  most  of  the  transactions.  In addition, we have evaluated the system with a 40-user sample. This  user sample was divided into two groups, each with 20 users. Each user in  the first group completed one MobiCash transaction at a location of extremely  low  GSM  signal  strength   around  7  km  away  from  the  base  station .  The  next 20 observations from group 2 were measured at a location of extremely  high GSM signal strength  at around 250 m distance from the base station .  Given these observations  as shown in Figure 11.4 , there was no considerable   Table 11.1  In Network Performance  Mean Standard deviation  T1  s   49.677 8.216  T2  s   44.34 7.311  Total  s    94.021 10.534        Chapter eleven:  MobiCash  205  Low signal strength  High signal strength    s     e m T  i  120  110  100  90  80  70  60    s     e m T  i  120  100  80  60  40  20  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  9  10  11  8 13 Transaction number  12  Figure  11.4  Transaction  completion  time.

We observed that GSM signal strength does not affect the system  performances to a great extent. Given this finding, the system is suitable for  rural areas, where the GSM signal strength is considerably low.  Since there is no effect from GSM signal strength, all 40 users were  asked to do a transaction on traditional ATM machine. Time taken to each  transaction has been measured. Figure 11.5 illustrates the measurements. According  to  Figure  11.5,  the  traditional  ATM  takes  less  time  to  complete  a  transaction.  However,  the  traveling  time  to  a  traditional  ATM machine and waiting time on queue for an ATM machine makes   MobiCash  Atm  10987654321  11  12  13  14  15  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  17  20  19  18  16 25 Transaction number  24  23  22  21  Figure 11.5  Transaction completion time comparison  MobiCash and ATM .        206  Mobile Electronic Commerce  the  completion  time  higher  than  the  transaction  completion  time  for  a  MobiCash. Even though MobiCash takes more time than traditional ATM  to complete a transaction, given the argument related to accessing an ATM  machine, MobiCash has the potential to be accepted by the community as  a more efficient process for certain financial transactions.  Furthermore, we have performed 120 transactions on MobiCash and  all were completed with a successful response from the system. We are  confident in the stability of the MobiCash system.  11.6  Discussion All participants in the MobiCash network are registered through a face- to-face procedure by a trusted third-party registration agent. Therefore,  all  identities  are  strongly  verified.  Identity,  financial,  and  authorization  data are stored in databases in an encrypted form. Data cannot be illegally  accessed by unauthorized individuals.  All participants in the system have personal security credentials: key  pairs, certificates, and other security tokens. For customers, they are safely  stored in their mobile phones, encrypted, and accessible only after per- sonal authentication.  Hash codes generate from subscribers’ PIN number, application ID, and  phone number to match against the hash code stored in registration servers.  This feature ensures safety against faking phone numbers and cloning the  mobile application. Additionally, it guarantees the identity of the person who  uses the application, because of the PIN number included in the hash code.  All messages are digitally signed, encrypted, and enveloped for the tar- geted recipient. Thus, the system provides integrity and confidentiality to a  particular transaction [25]. It is also convenient to have nonreputability for  the electronic transactions. As noted in Figure 11.3, the bank generates and  sends two random numbers: the confirmation number to the customer and  the transaction number to the MobiCash agent. To complete the transaction,  the system design requires the customer to disclose this confirmation num- ber to the MobiCash agent. Only after that does the MobiCash agent have  authority to give the money to the customer. In the context of the MobiCash  agent, the confirmation number received from the customer is strong evi- dence to verify that the transaction has happened completely. Very similar  to  the    scenario  as  described  earlier,  the  bank  transfers  money  from  the  customer’s  account  to  the  MobiCash  agent’s  account  only  after  receiving  the transaction number and the confirmation number from the MobiCash  agent. Hence, none of the parties can roll back the transaction in an illegal  way. Moreover, the transaction number received from the MobiCash agent  is evidence to verify that the MobiCash agent has completed the  transaction.  So, the proposed system provides the guarantee of nonrepudiation for both  customer and MobiCash agent.        Chapter eleven:  MobiCash  207  The system uses asymmetric key cryptography to provide security as  well as a third-party registration agent [26]. Therefore, subscribers have to  accept the cost of retrieving the certificate and registration, being the main  disadvantage of the system. Thus, the use of trusted third-party certifi- cation authority and third-party registration agent enables interbanking  money withdrawals after few modifications to the MobiCash servers.  Only five essential SMS messages are used for a transaction, and a  commission must be paid to the MobiCash agent. This commission should  be paid by the customer. The cost of the SMS messages can be distributed  among the customer and the bank. From the bank’s point of view, it is  economically advantageous to pay for the SMS instead of deploying a tra- ditional ATM.  11.7  Conclusion The proposed system intended to address difficulties in accessing ATM  services. One of the distinguishing features of the MobiCash system that  makes it different from any other similar system is its security. The MobiSys  system provides confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and nonrepudabil- ity, which are essential in financial transactions. It enables more security  features relevant to the ATM transaction. The proposed MobiCash system  also provides legally acceptable evidence about transactions.  Without having any additional cost on new infrastructure, existing   mobile networks can be used to deploy the system.  The system can scale smoothly to interbanking level and further to  the international level. It is compatible with existing security and commu- nication protocols, so further extensions to the system are feasible.  To sum up, MobiCash system addressed a major service gap in bank- ing industry and serve people in rural areas to solve their problems, which  was critical to their social and economic development.  For the future study, we will investigate the community acceptance  level of the system. Perception of system security and privacy issues are  still needed to be identified.  References    1.

Competing  vendors  rush  to  introduce  new  and  innovative  fea- tures, with much emphasis placed on user interaction richness. This con- trasts with developments in mainframe and desktop systems, where most  of the development was focused on benefitting from increasing processing  power and storage, with one major shift from the text-based, command  line, interface to the window, icon, mouse, pointer  WIMPy –based graphic  user  interface  in  the  1980s.  The  other  major  paradigm  shift  in  business  computing was the move from in-house computing, with trained employ- ees accessing systems, to customers directly accessing business systems, as  is the case in e-commerce. Systems developers, building systems for direct  customer access, had to build adequate safeguards to prevent data corrup- tion and design the interface to meet customer expectations. A dominant  platform  arose  quickly  for  business  developers  with  the  MS  Windows  environment dominating in the case of desktop computing and a combi- nation of hypertext markup language  HTML  and JavaScript becoming  the dominant web e-commerce environment. This simplified development  and developers could focus on one dominant technology. However, in the  case of mobile computing, there are multiple vendors promoting their own  platforms; in some cases, a single hardware vendor may support multiple  operating systems. Mobile computing places a premium on high intercon- nectivity, rich multimodal interaction, and user mobility. These features  are  rare  in  conventional  systems  development,  and  developers  need  to  understand the benefits and limitations of the technologies used in mobile  computing. In addition, mobile network providers favor some modes of  connectivity over others, making it necessary for developers to alter appli- cations based on communications network providers. The highly fractured  marketplace makes it challenging to develop mobile electronic commerce  applications that can function effectively on different devices.  Developers  may  either  choose  to  build  and  optimize  for  one  plat- form  or  build  a  multiplatform  application  that  provides  satisfactory   performance on multiple platforms. This impacts the choice of a suitable         Chapter twelve:  Mobile electronic commerce development  213  development tool, since many mobile hardware providers offer toolsets  that are designed to develop optimized applications for their hardware.  Hence, a major issue for mobile development is whether to develop native  applications optimized for one class of hardware or to develop web-based  applications where the mobile device is merely the user interface and per- forms very little data processing. In native code development, a significant  part of the application’s code is placed on the mobile device. Hence, dif- ferent versions of this code need to be developed and maintained for each  mobile device on which the application is used. The web-based applica- tion approach is most beneficial from the developer’s perspective since it  can be ported from established desktop laptop browser-based versions,  with the primary rework being limited to screen size variation for small  mobile devices. However, many of the specialized features of mobile hard- ware can be accessed only through the code specifically designed for the  device, and applications with a rich user experience need to be designed  to optimize relatively scarce resources on the mobile device.  Electronic  commerce  applications  benefit  from  the  network  effect,  where  the  applications  become  more  valuable,  when  many  other  users  utilize them. Mobile applications are richly interactive, supporting inter- action with the user and between users. Consequently, they benefit even  more from the network effect. The development process needs to consider  this  and  develop  applications  in  a  manner  that  facilitates  rapid  accep- tance and adoption by many users to benefit from the network effect. As  a result, mobile developers prefer to use modular, prebuilt widgets and  rapid applications development  RAD  approaches to quickly put together  prototype  applications,  which  can  be  deployed  quickly.  A  challenge  in  mobile  development  is  the  short  half-life  of  mobile  applications,  which  need ongoing modification to remain competitive. While system mainte- nance has always been more expensive than new systems development,  the problem is much worse in the mobile e-commerce marketplace, due  to the constant need to adapt to new market pressures and technology  changes. Mobile e-commerce developers need to continually monitor how  their applications use device and network resources, such as battery power  and  net  bandwidth,  and  ensure  that  they  do  not  hog  device  resources.  A mobile application that is not maintained will rapidly lose market share  and be replaced by more nimble competitors  ABI Research, 2013 .  The user interface in mobile devices uses a variety of convenient inputs  from the user, ranging from touch input common in current hardware to  voice, gestures  shake, point , and visual inputs. In addition, the devices  can capture data about the user’s location, acceleration, and environment  automatically  from  the  device’s  built-in  sensors.  Mobile  electronic  com- merce applications need to be designed to meet the needs and capabilities  of rich input from these sources. The user interface for mobile apps needs to  consider the overall user experience in a highly competitive marketplace.        214  Mobile Electronic Commerce  12.2  Development methodologies Systems development methodologies range from the traditional waterfall  approach of the SDLC to agile technologies such as Scrum and Extreme  Programming. Mobile applications are designed to respond to a rapidly  evolving  marketplace,  with  an  emphasis  on  rich  customer  interaction,  location  awareness,  and  the  ability  to  effectively  handle  microtransac- tions.  Agile  methodologies  are  used  extensively  in  mobile  applications  development due to development time pressures and market adaptation  requirements. The D-mobile model proposed in 2004 has five phases, and  each phase has 3 days of development, one each for planning, working  and releasing the product. This provides a quick 15-workday development  cycle  with  close  user–developer  contact  and  interaction   Abrahamsson  et al., 2004 . The process is suited to small mobile projects that deliver data  over mobile devices. A proposed spiral model, based on multiple loops  that  can  ensure  application  interface  usability,  is  more  suited  to  larger  and riskier projects that support complex user interaction with the mobile  application  Nosseir et al., 2012 .  12.2.1  Web applications Mobile electronic commerce applications can be developed as web-based  applications that run in the browser or as native applications that run on  the mobile device. The first attempts in mobile computing ported stan- dard browser screen designs to small mobile devices. These web pages,  adapted from desktop browser designs, rendered poorly, and the inter- face  elements  such  as  drop-down  lists  and  buttons  were  inconvenient  for  mobile  users.  The  wireless  access  protocol   WAP   promoted  by  the  WAP Forum was developed to adapt e-commerce web pages and scripts  designed  for  larger  screens  to  render  effectively  on  small  screens  and  devices, especially those connected through low-bandwidth connections.  The protocol used intermediate servers to store and serve large web pages  in a mobile format. The technology failed to gain market acceptance due  to a lack of widespread agreement on the WAP standard and the cost of  implementing the intermediate servers by different mobile network pro- viders. Modern mobile devices have sufficient bandwidth to deliver the  web content for electronic commerce and, in most cases, have browsers  that  can  handle  HTML,  CSS,  and  JavaScript,  which  are  the  underlying  technologies for web-based applications. There have been problems with  some  specialized  web  technologies,  such  as  Flash  on  Apple’s  devices.  Often, these problems have been the result of conflicts between  vendors.  The small screen size of mobile devices makes it necessary for web appli- cations  developers  to  redesign  web  page  formats.  In  addition,  mobile  e-commerce  is  conducted  in  shorter  sessions  and  in  a  wide  variety  of         Chapter twelve:  Mobile electronic commerce development  215  environmental  conditions,  such  as  lighting  and  street  noise,  making  it  necessary  for  application  developers  to  consider  usage  conditions  in  designing the interface.  12.2.2  Native applications Native applications offer lower latency, deal with loss of connectivity in  transit  situations,  and  can  be  optimized  for  specific  hardware.  In  web  applications, user interactions are processed on remote servers, leading to  latency in user feedback. JavaScript code runs on the browser and elimi- nates the round trip for many simple interactions. While improvements in  JavaScript have made it competitive in many e-commerce environments,  the  language  cannot  provide,  at  present,  the  responsiveness  offered  by  native code that runs on the hardware. When does it make sense to build  native applications?  The choice is analogous to the thin client–fat client decision that was  common in the client–server application development era. Fat client soft- ware performs most of its work on the device and offers fast interactive  response,  while  thin  clients  perform  most  of  their  work  on  the  remote  server  and  are  hampered  by  network  latency.  System  administrators  preferred  thin  clients  due  to  the  overall  efficiency  of  resource  use  and  centralized control over the application, while most clients preferred fat  clients due to low latency and personal control. Mobile device hardware  has become more capable, with memory and processing power exceed- ing early desktops. This has made it feasible to run fat-client applications  on mobile devices. However, mobile devices continue to lag behind cur- rent laptop and desktop hardware in both hardware capability and wired  network  bandwidth  and  face  a  major  problem  in  battery  power  limita- tion. Mobile applications need to be optimized to run effectively under  hardware, bandwidth, and battery power limitations. This suggests the  need to build customized hardware-specific versions of mobile applica- tions. Early recommendations for mobile development were focused on  the resource limitations  Tarasewich, 2003 . A mobile applications devel- opment  framework  proposes  a  taxonomy  of  mobile  applications  based  on  mobile  media  delivery   broadcast ,  real-time  location-sensitive  data,  business transaction completion, and collaboration and describes suitable  development and maintenance approaches for each category of applica- tion  Unhelkar et al., 2010 .  However,  if  native  applications  are  developed,  they  also  need  to  be  maintained.  When  a  new  version  of  a  phone  operating  system   OS   is  released, or when new phone hardware is introduced, the native application  needs many more changes than a web application. Unless there is a major  change in the underlying hardware, web applications, even those that call  hardware features such as a camera image or GPS readings will continue to         216  Mobile Electronic Commerce  function. On the other hand, native applications, which run more effectively,  will  make  hardware-specific  calls  that  may  need  to  be  updated  for  new   hardware.  This  adds  to  development  and  maintenance  complexity,  with  developers needing to build and maintain multiple versions of the product.  12.2.3  Hybrid Many mobile applications are developed in a hybrid format with core web  applications, enhanced with native features to enrich interaction. Hybrid  applications are often built on mobile development toolsets that allow the  developer to use standard JavaScript in development, with custom appli- cation  programming  interface   API   calls  for  specific  features.  During  application  compilation,  the  toolset  adds  hardware-specific  code  to  the  delivered  application,  customized  for  each  type  of  hardware.  Finally,  many  mobile  applications  depend  on  cloud  services  for  data,  notifica- tions,  and  user  interaction.  As  a  result,  these  applications  can  be  built  effectively on cloud-based toolsets, which offer access through convenient  APIs to cloud-based services, enabling a plug-and-play approach to cus- tom mobile app development.  Integrated development environment  12.3  Mobile applications development platforms 12.3.1  Integrated development environments  IDEs  provide a platform for devel- opers to build and deploy multitier applications. Eclipse is a well-known  open source IDE that supports development in many different languages.  Develop toolkits can be plugged into Eclipse to facilitate development in  different languages and for different platforms. For example, the Android  Developer Tools  ADT  software development kit  SDK  can be plugged  into the open source Eclipse IDE to develop android apps, which will run  on mobile devices using the Android operating system. Proprietary devel- opment platforms are supported by vendors, who promote the platform as  a convenient way to develop applications for their devices. Many propri- etary platforms have polished interfaces, custom plug-ins that reduce the  chores of programmers, and support code optimization for their devices.  Developers focusing on a particular platform, say, the iPhone, would pre- fer to use the Xcode IDE, and program using the objective-C language,  to develop apps optimized for Apple’s iOS. Microsoft’s Visual Studio is  a widely used IDE for many languages and is well suited for developing  Windows phone applications using the C Sharp programming language.  Visual  Studio  add-ons  are  available  for  developing  Android  apps  and  apps that work on other platforms. Google provides the Android Studio  IDE, a customized version of the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.        Chapter twelve:  Mobile electronic commerce development  217  Features  offered  by  integrated  development  environments  include   1  layout editors with drag-and-drop features to position and size user  interface  components,   2   template-based  wizards  to  create  common  designs,  3  tools to document app performance on hardware, and  4  the  ability to quickly build apps to run on different versions of the OS. IDEs  provided by vendors have features specific to the mobile device OS and  typically  can  add  plug-ins  with  highly  optimized,  prebuilt  features.  Many app development IDEs also support cloud-based app support, such  as  cloud-based  databases,  server  side  components  that  handle  business   processes, and other features such as messaging.  Applications for mobile use, like many other web-based applications,  use the model-view-controller  MVC  approach. This approach splits the  application into three major categories. The first is the model, which is the  data model used to store data, that is, a database. The controller refers to  the code that manages the business process, the link between the user and  the business system. The data are held in cloud storage, and the control- ler runs largely on the server, though parts of the controller could run on  the user device. The view is the part of the application that presents the  user interface, displays data, and interacts with the user. It is easy to build  models and controllers that are shared across multiple hardware devices  and operating systems. The major change occurs in the view component,  which needs to be customized and optimized for devices.  12.3.2  Cloud-based development platforms Many mobile applications are developed for the cloud. While cloud appli- cations can be built from the ground up, using a stand-alone IDE, it is  preferable to use development platforms targeted for cloud-based mobile  services.  The  reason  is  the  short  half-life  of  new  mobile   applications.  Many  mobile  applications  fulfill  a  short-term  need  and  need  to  be  updated  in  the  future.  A  full-fledged  development  process  will  take  a  long time, and application designers will be hard-pressed to find knowl- edgeable users for testing a yet-to-be-developed application. Platforms  for developing cloud-based mobile applications provide toolsets for the  most common features, enabling a quick drag-and-drop development of  mobile application prototypes. In addition to beta testing, cloud-based  applications can be scaled for growth. Hence, they can be used to grow  market share, and full-fledged development can be initiated after mar- ket growth patterns are understood and a revenue model is established.  Many  platforms  for  cloud-based  mobile  application  development  are  themselves on the cloud, enabling development teams to quickly access  and build prototype systems.  Many mobile applications use common features for mobile computing  such as social networking, cloud-based data storage for both customer data         218  Mobile Electronic Commerce  and business data, and push notification services to deliver  customer-focused  updates. Microservices provide very small chunks of content and could come  from  one  source  or  multiple  individual  community  sources   Christophe  et al., 2011 . The mobile Backend-as-a-Service  BaaS  model offers these ser- vices as an easily accessible API. Developers using a cloud-based BaaS can  quickly access these resources and build their applications. At present, many  BaaS providers offer a freemium model to encourage application develop- ers to use their platform for development. The freemium model charges for  services only when demand rises above a preset level. Hence, a prototype  model can be built and rolled out at low cost, with charges accruing only  after business picks up.  12.3.3  Platform comparison There are many frameworks for creating mobile web applications based  on HTML5 and JavaScript. These frameworks offer custom script modules  to quickly develop robust mobile web applications. Apache Cordova can  be used for many devices including Windows Phones  Eberhardt, 2012 .  A  comparison  of  Rhodes  from  Motorola,  the  popular  PhoneGap  from  Adobe, which is based on Apache Cordova, Dragon Rad from Seregon, and  MoSync, an open source solution, presents tables summarizing their fea- tures for development, architecture, preferred software model, and mobile  OS support  Palmieri et al., 2012 . Another study compares the performance  of two versions of a simple test application developed using different cross  platform tools, Phone Gap, and Titanium  Dalmasso et al., 2013 .  Various vendors provide toolsets that can facilitate mobile develop- ment. Their toolsets run on existing platforms for development, and these  could be general-purpose IDEs or specialized mobile development plat- forms. It should be noted that the tools are all under continued develop- ment, and any feature set presented in a study needs to be rapidly revised  to  current  conditions.  Table  12.1  contains  a  list  of  currently  available  mobile e-commerce development tools.  12.3.4  Vendor-supported vendor-sponsored application stores Many mobile device vendors, and mobile telecommunications networks  that provide access, maintain control over the applications they permit and  support on their platforms. The control is primarily exercised through a  licensing and approval process for the installation of the native application  on hardware. This contrasts with the situation in desktop- and  web-based  computing,  where  applications  can  be  developed  and   marketed  by  the  developer with little interference, approval needs, or licensing fees from  the hardware, operating system, or network provider. In the case of mobile  applications using native code, vendors typically take a cut on revenues,         Chapter twelve:  Mobile electronic commerce development  219  Table 12.1  Mobile E-Commerce Development  Appcelerator titanium http:  www.appcelerator.com  titanium   Titanium is a JavaScript development tool with  many UI widgets for RAD.

In  addition,  many  platform  owners  such  as  Apple,  Microsoft,  Google,  or  Blackberry   maintain  application  stores, where the product is offered for sale. These application stores are   proprietary malls, and in addition to enforced  revenue sharing, the plat- form owners restrict both the functioning and content of the  applications.  The focus of limits on code functions is primarily to ensure security and  control interaction between applications loaded on the hardware. These  limitations  screen  and  stop  applications  containing  the  code  that  vio- lates  the  rules  of  the  marketplace,  as  enforced  by  the  platform  owner.  In   addition,  applications  are  tested  to  ensure  they  do  not  hog  excessive  resources  or  deter  other  applications  from  performing  their  operations.  While most restrictions on code operations are designed to prevent badly  behaved applications from creating hardware conflicts and crashing the  system, the approval process takes time and delays deployment. Mobile  system developers need to consider the delay in deployment when plan- ning the rollout schedule for their product. Often, using the development  platform  prescribed  by  the  platform  owner,  following  prescribed  cod- ing  guidelines,  and  limiting  the  code  to  using  only  authorized  features  will be adequate to meet approval requirements. Another more variable  factor is the content of the application. The application could face delays  in approval and rejection if it violates content guidelines laid out by the  platform  owners  as  a  prerequisite  for  approval.  Note  that  unapproved  applications cannot be installed on devices, and many platforms lock their  devices. Violations of device locking rules amount to civil and criminal  violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act  DCMA .  Another concern for mobile developers is the limits placed on apps  operating on mobile networks. Net neutrality on the wired Internet has  been debated for a long time. The only certainty regarding net neutrality  is  that  there  is  much  disagreement  on  what  it  implies.  Mobile  network  providers  have  much  more  control  over  their  broadband  traffic  than  ISPs  providing  wired  access.  As  a  result,  mobile  providers  can  choose  to  shut  down  applications  either  through  cooperative  agreements  with         Chapter twelve:  Mobile electronic commerce development  221  mobile  device  makers  or  by  packet  shaping  and  bandwidth  throttling  any  application they deem unsuitable. This can include applications that  conflict with their other business needs, such as the use of VoIP apps over  mobile systems that reduce voice communications usage.  12.4  Mobile application technology 12.4.1  Hardware interaction Developers prefer to use a programming tool language that allows them  to write code focusing on the business process, while leaving hardware  interaction to the OS. In the case of mobile development, there are many  different  types  of  hardware  and  operating  systems.  These  platforms  gain  or  lose  market  share,  and  market  relevance,  rapidly.  A  true  cross- platform development tool should support the development of application  source code that can be easily deployed on many devices. In practice, it  is  necessary to make minor and sometimes major modifications for each  device due to ongoing technology changes. In addition to multiple hard- ware vendors, there is the problem of new interfaces with changes from  single to multitouch, accelerometers, and gesture recognition. The task of  code maintenance is simplified when common code can be developed for  many devices, with only minor variations for special features.  The hardware abstraction layer  HAL  is code that translates instruc- tions  from  the  application  to  hardware-specific  instructions.  Each  class  of device hardware, whether the CPU or an interface device, has its own  instruction  set,  termed  the  instruction  set  architecture   ISA .  Highly  optimized code should send the most suitable instructions for a specific  hardware using its ISA. However, this will mean that developers should  write  and  maintain  hardware-specific  code.  The  HAL  provides  a  com- mon API for sending instructions to the device, allowing the developer  to code using the common API. As a result, the application can work on  a  variety  of  devices,  as  long  as  the  operating  system  uses  an  appropri- ate HAL to interact with the hardware. This simplifies development and,  more importantly, maintenance, since code maintenance costs are much  more than code development costs over the life cycle of the application.  If new hardware allows for unique input types, such as pressure-sensitive  input to a tablet screen, a new version of the OS needs to accommodate  the enriched API, and the HAL for the new device must translate the new  values. In addition, the enhanced application will have features that will  not be available on old platforms. This will create a fork in the application  development process, with one version supported on old hardware and  another on new hardware.  The  rapid  influx  of  new  hardware  features  such  as  cameras  with  new  features  such  as  3D  photography,  GPS  systems,  accelerometers         222  Mobile Electronic Commerce  that  detect  motion  speed  and  direction,  and  new  communications   technologies like near field communication  NFC  have made it neces- sary  for  developers  to  maintain  multiple  versions  of  applications  that  adopt the new features. There are also differences between the products  offered by different vendors. An Android device typically uses Google  Android  APIs  for  the  interface,  Apple’s  devices  use  the  CocoaTouch  APIs,  Windows  phones  use  Silverlight,  and  a  web  application  using  a  mobile  browser  uses  the  HTML5 JavaScript  framework.  Incidentally,  while HTML5 for web page tags is a W3C standard, there are multiple  mobile frameworks for script development. Standards include the open  source jQuery standard for scripting and proprietary frameworks that  offer  advanced  features  for  quickly  developing  mobile  apps  such  as  Sencha Touch and Appcelerator Titanium.  12.4.2  API intermediary layer One solution offered by mobile applications developer tools is to create a  layer of tools that emulate device hardware, for example, a screen tool that  emulates the screen. The developer will write code to interact with the  emulated screen. The developer toolset uses its own tool, which takes the  applications requests and translates them into the specific device hard- ware. While this approach provides benefits to developers, these appli- cations are slower and less responsive than native apps. In addition, the  developer toolset needs to be continually updated for new hardware and  new OS-specific APIs that are introduced. Developers face the risk of ven- dor demise, which will leave their applications unsupported. Standards  for  intermediary  APIs  have  been  proposed  to  enable  the  creation  of  device-independent applications. The MODIF framework proposes a user  interface   UI   markup  language,  uniform  APIs  for  the  device  interface,  and transformational models that connect the common APIs to device- specific calls  Cimino and Marcelloni, 2012 .  12.4.3  Modularization and hardware dependency A challenge facing mobile application developers is the wide range of  hardware and operating systems for mobile devices. In particular, mobile  devices have numerous hardware features that vary between devices. In  the desktop sphere, business computing adopted the Microsoft OS on  the Intel chip instruction set, and the Windows, Icons, Mouse, Pointer   WIMPy   interface  grew  to  be  widely  accepted,  providing  business  application developers with a common GUI. While other operating sys- tems from Apple and the Linux open source OS were also used, these  products became niche markets for developers. In many cases, business         Chapter twelve:  Mobile electronic commerce development  223  applications were first developed for the dominant platform, and  versions  for other platforms were either unavailable or performed suboptimally.  In the case of mobile systems, both hardware and software markets are  highly fragmented, and worse, each platform has multiple versions due  to rapid technology development. As a result, mobile business system  development has more in common with game development, where there  are multiple platforms with different hardware, operating systems, and  interfaces. This level of hardware dependency has made it challenging  to develop one application for many devices. One solution is to design  an  interface  with  only  those  features  that  are  found  in  all  commonly  used platforms. This can be narrowed to focus on a web application that  limits the interface to a web browser capable of operating on all systems,  a least common denominator approach. However, this approach leads  to very conservative interfaces that do not exploit new technology and  will not satisfy users who have made major investments in leading-edge  technology,  especially  in  the  case  of  consumerization  of  corporate  IT,  where users bring their own devices for use. Savvy users expect their  apps to exploit the high-end mobile device they have acquired with their  own money.  Mobile  applications  need  to  be  built  in  modules,  with  user-facing  modules developed independently of the rest of the system. This will sup- port the easy replacement of this module to adapt the system to new hard- ware and operating systems. This is especially useful since mobile device  technology is in the growth phase of its life cycle, and operating systems  for mobile devices are updated more frequently than for the more stable,  late-mature phase desktop environment.  12.4.4  Version control The wide variety of hardware and OS, as well as the high level of innova- tion in the field, make it necessary for mobile system developers to build  and maintain different versions of their applications. Branching in sys- tems development is a process in which a common system is customized  to  operate  effectively  on  a  particular  type  of  hardware OS.  Since  there  are  multiple  final  versions,  a  common  system  is  developed,  tested,  and  archived.  There  is  an  archived  codebase,  which  is  customized  for  each  platform.  These  customized  versions  are  called  branches.  Each  branch  may be further forked for new versions of the hardware software. At any  time, if a new version of hardware OS is introduced in the market, devel- opers may need to go back to the archived base and build from that point  to get a usable version for the new hardware OS. A process of merging is  used to recombine multiple branches, especially when there are too many  branches and code maintenance becomes unsustainable.        224  Mobile Electronic Commerce  12.5  Mobile user experience 12.5.1  Web pages Web applications are designed to be delivered over the Internet. The MVC  design used in web applications uses the view component to deliver the  user interface. Conventional web application design is focused on desk- top and laptop screens, delivering the content through a browser. When  users  connect  to  web  applications  through  mobile  devices,  they  use  a  much smaller screen for viewing the page. In the past, screen resolutions  were  much  lower  for  mobile  devices  than  for  desktop  devices,  but  that  difference has been almost eliminated with newer mobile devices. This  results in a subpar user experience.  1  The user may find it difficult to  discern screen elements,  2  screens may require multiple interaction steps  to be completely rendered, or  3  parts of the screen may be ignored by the  user. Since many mobile devices use a touch interface, screen icons need  to be sized for reliable touch interaction. An icon size that is suitable for  a mouse click is often too small for a fingertip touch. In addition, latency  is typically greater in mobile devices, leading to a longer page load for  a  content-rich  site.  A  responsive  web  design   Marcotte,  2011   delivers  a  suitable user experience regardless of screen size, by scaling web page ele- ments and reorganizing content based on the user device’s screen capabil- ity. Challenges in designing responsive websites exist for many industries  such as banking  Crosman, 2013 , health services  Beil, 2012 , newspapers   Serm et al., 2006 , and education  Fisher and Baird, 2006 . Over 50 tools to  help build responsive websites are presented by Denise and Peter  2012 .  Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  are used to change the display format  for HTML pages. The changes can range from mundane color and font  variations based on user and device preferences to complex formatting  changes for page elements. It is the ability of CSS to change how page ele- ments are formatted that enables responsive web design  Frederick, 2013 . While  mobile  devices’  interfaces  have  rapidly  progressed  to  fully  functional  touch–based  screens,  and  the  primary  difference  between  desktop  designs  and  mobile  designs  for  the  UI  is  the  limited  screen  real-estate  mobile  devices  are  used  in  a  wide  variety  of  environments,  unlike desktop devices that are used in controlled work environments.  The user lacks control over the environment in which mobile devices are  used, due to noise, lighting conditions, and traffic hazards. Because of the  differences in the context in which mobile devices are used, the mobile  UI designer needs to develop resilient designs that can be effective in a  range of environmental conditions. A controlled experiment conducted  in 2007, when mobile devices had a highly constrained UI, discusses the  need to consider the fact that the mobile UI cannot be as immersive as  the desktop UI due to environmental conditions under which it is used         Chapter twelve:  Mobile electronic commerce development  225   Isomorsu et al., 2008 . The study presents many interesting metaphors to  contrast mobile and desktop net usage. The mobile UI needs to be opti- mized for standardized use where the user performs a standard action  many  times,  rather  than  a  nonstandard  highly  customized,  incremen- tally developed interaction. For example, in a pizza store application, the  mobile user may order the same pizza many times and needs an interface  that is optimized for this repetitive task.  12.5.2  Device load management In addition to screen size, the smaller bandwidth and mobile connectivity  interruptions impose limitations on the mobile web application design.  Applications that impose a heavy load on mobile device resources will  impact  user  experience.  An  application  that  drains  battery  power,  the  weakest and scarcest resource in a mobile environment, will quickly fall  out of favor. It is recommended that web applications reduce the number  of HTTP requests, use compressed versions of content, preload necessary  interaction  components,  and  plan  the  use  of  caches  to  optimize  mobile  web application performance  Matsudaira, 2013; Nicolaou, 2013 . This is  not significantly different from web application guidelines used when net  bandwidth is a scarce resource. All this implies is that developers need  to return to a focus on parsimony in design, which was the hallmark of  early software engineering. Mobile application performance needs to be  monitored in real time to ensure that users get the quality of service  QoS   promised by the application.  A cyber foraging approach, in which applications off-load processor- intensive  operations  onto  remote  servers  based  on  a  decision  model  that  considers  mobile  device  capability  and  cloud  server  availability,  is  described for photo processing and gaming applications  Verbelen et al.,  2012 . A similar load management approach has been described for data  mining of continuous data streams using mobile devices, where resource  awareness  is  handled  by  variation  in  analysis  detail,  rather  than  off-  loading processing  Haghighi et al., 2013 . The off-loading should be built  into the mobile application for overall effectiveness. Using standard vir- tual machine images on mobile devices adds too much load on the device  to provide significant computational advantage  Shiraz et al., 2013 .  12.5.3  Touch and haptic technology While  mobile  devices  lack  screen  space,  they  often  incorporate  a  wide  range of user input formats and enhanced outputs to improve user interac- tivity. Consumerization of information technology in the workplace refers  to  the  use  of  new  technology  in  mobile  devices  purchased  by  the  user         226  Mobile Electronic Commerce  and  utilized  in  the  work  environment.  In  the  past,  computing  devices  were expensive, acquired by the business and assigned to employees for  work. Corporate IT departments specified and controlled the acquisition of  devices for work and, in most cases, managed them with strict rules. The  rapid reduction in the cost of mobile devices, coupled with their rich inter- face and connectivity, has created a generation of users who prefer to use  personal devices at work. These users have rapidly enhanced their skills in  using preferred personal devices and invested significant human capital  in  learning  to  use  the  tool  effectively.  Mobile  devices   support  high  con- nectivity and offer far richer interfaces than office computers provided by  corporate IT. In addition, since mobile devices are typically held by the user  and in close physical contact, they utilize creative approaches to alerting  and interacting with the user. Mobile application developers need to incor- porate touch interaction in their application view  component. While this  has generally meant a separate fork in UI development for mobile devices,  the influx of  touch-sensitive tablets and introduction of touch-capable lap- tops points to a future where all e-commerce applications will use a touch- capable interface.  Touch is a major component of the interaction, and vendors are mov- ing toward pressure-sensitive touch  Greene, 2009  that will allow users  to vary their input by varying pressure. Though pressure-sensitive touch  has been available through dedicated sketch pads  Wacom, 2013 , it has  not  been  available  for  on-screen  use.  Workarounds  have  been  devel- oped using a pressure-sensitive stylus  Steele, 2013  that however impact  device mobility.  Haptic technologies provide a feedback approach that uses tactile  responses, such as vibrations. Haptic technology has developed from  early iterations where the entire device vibrated to vibrations focused  on  a  small  part  of  the  surface  area,  thereby  providing  feedback  cus- tomized  to  an  area  of  the  device.  Improvements  in  this  technology  will  enable  effective  Braille  responses  on  mobile  devices,  leading  to  improvements  in  communications  with  individuals  with  disabilities.  An   electro-vibration  technology  under  development  uses   electrical  charges to simulate vibration  Liszewski, 2013 . Though being experi- mental  at  present,  some  of  these  technologies  are  likely  to  become  mainstream in the future.  12.5.4  Voice input and output Voice  input  is  useful  in  mobile  devices  used  in  a  highly  variable   environment,  where  complete  user  immersion  in  the  device  is  neither  feasible  nor  recommended.  Speech  recognition   and  text  to  speech   is  typically performed by a separate application that transfers the data to  the mobile application. The HTML Speech Incubator Group of the W3C         Chapter twelve:  Mobile electronic commerce development  227  has developed a report on how HTML can grow to accept speech inputs   W3C, 2011 . At present, vendors use different approaches to coding and  delivering  speech  output  to  applications.  Nuance’s  SpeechAnywhere,  iSpeech,  and  ATT  Watson  are  cloud-based  services  that  can  be  called  by client-side scripts to decipher and return text. Software development  kits  for  these  services  allow  the  developer  to  call  the  cloud  service  in  their  application  code.  Applications  that  need  speech  recognition  for  a  few words, typically commands, can use a client-side code module from  OpenEars. This follows a freemium pricing model, with a paid version  offering better recognition, including real-time recognition. Other client- side speech recognition modules include CMU Sphinx, an open source  product that can link to web applications written in the python language,  and SpeakEasy, based on the Nuance engine.  Voice output for mobile applications is often essential for handsfree  mobile computing in industrial workspaces and on the road. An option  for mobile apps that delivers text to speech is VoiceOver, a screen reader  app, which reads screen elements. When developing web apps for mobile  e-commerce,  developers  must  ensure  they  follow  screen  reader  guide- lines  to  ensure  mobile  device  usable  pages   Rangin  and  Hahn,  2011 .  Guidelines  include  ensuring  that  interactive  icons’  actions  are  clearly  stated. For example, if clicking on an icon will open a new window, the  screen reader will, by default, merely state that it is a clickable icon, and  read the text caption provided for the icon. The mobile-enabled applica- tion  should  clearly  explain  the  action  that  will  take  place  if  the  icon  is  clicked. Another guideline relates to long drop-down lists that are easily  visually  searchable, such as a list of 50 states, but turn out to be extremely  inconvenient for a screen reader. In addition, multimedia links must be  accessible; for example, audio tracks should have transcripts.  12.5.5  Gestures and movement Gesture  input  recognizes  human  gestures  mostly  from  the  hands  or  from  facial  gestures.  Gesture  recognition  can  extend  to  body  posture  and  movement.  Gesture  recognition  and  feedback  can  be  based  on   intrusive devices such as sensor gloves and body suits, and minimally  invasive devices such as multiple cameras capable of stereoscopic vision  and  motion  sensors  embedded  in  mobile  devices.  True  gesture  recog- nition  should  not  involve  touch,  and  the  location  and  movement  in  a  three-dimensional  space  should  be  recognized  by  the  device.  Swype  technology used to recognize text using continuous touch motions is not  true gesture recognition. Current technology for hand, face, or body ges- ture recognition requires large sensors and is not yet suitable for small  mobile  devices.  However,  motion  sensors  embedded  in  mobile  devices  can be used to specifically recognize hand and body movements, such as         228  Mobile Electronic Commerce  a shake for near field data transfer. A set of user-defined motion gestures  for mobile interaction is presented by Ruiz et al.  2011 . Advances in this  technology  using  multiple  motion  sensors  and  dedicated  hardware  for  data analysis offer the promise of effective gesture recognition  Zhu et al.,  2013 .  Accelerometers  and  compasses  provide  movement  and  direction  information.  The  gyroscopes  present  in  some  smartphones  have  been  demonstrated  to  provide  accurate  orientation  information  that  can  be  used in applications providing accurate walking directions in enclosed  areas  Barthold et al., 2011 .  12.5.6  Visual and augmented reality Most mobile devices have a camera, often two  one facing the user and  the other rear-facing . Camera quality has improved, both in pixel reso- lution and in digital signal processing of images, which enhances image  quality. While the physical size limits of mobile devices limits the optical  quality of built-in cameras, rapid advances in optical sensors and digital  signal processing have enabled the production of higher quality images.  Mobile applications routinely file and post camera images to user social  network sites. Advanced features include using face recognition capabil- ity to identify individuals and enhance interaction.  Augmented reality adds features to a real worldview, enhancing the  user experience. This can range from adding descriptive data to a cam- era view  building address, name, and features  to showing the product  specs when a product code is scanned by a phone camera. Mobile applica- tions need to sense GPS location data and movement from accelerometers  and combine it with cloud-based information to create augmented reality  views on the screen or through audio output.  12.5.7  User attention spans Mobile application developers need to consider user attention spans on  mobile devices. In addition to the small screen size in mobile devices, and  multiple distractions in the mobile environment, which we discussed in  the earlier section, users tend to interact in multiple short sessions with  their mobile devices. Internet traffic is typically composed of asymmetric  bursts, with short bursts from users followed by longer bursts from the  service,  and  is  conducted  over  an  extended  session.  In  contrast,  mobile  device interactions are typically a series of short bursts  Oulasvirta et al.,  2005 , interspersed with other unrelated activities. Texting and  tweeting  interaction  captures  this  dynamic  effectively.  Hence,  mobile  applica- tions need to be developed for this manner of user interaction. Long web  pages need to be split into shorter segments, with effective search tools to  provide the necessary information.        Chapter twelve:  Mobile electronic commerce development  229  12.5.8  Security Passwords have been used as an authentication tool since the mainframe  era. The approach is now well past its prime and needs to be updated to  suit current needs. Single-factor authentication with passwords is con- sidered unsuitable even for in-house access from desktops, and business  has moved toward two-factor authentication, with access cards and other  technology. The password approach to authentication assumes a secure  workplace, and a log-on at the start of a session, which continues unin- terrupted for a few hours. In the case of mobile devices, user interaction  modes are very different, with repeated access in short microbursts from  many locations. The concept of a work session, with clearly defined start  and  stop  authentication  events,  is  replaced  by  an  authenticated  device  that is authorized for multiple, independent interactions. In many mobile  applications,  the  password  approach  is  ported  to  the  mobile  version,  with  a  password  entered  on  the  first  access  from  the  device,  which  is  henceforth authenticated for a prolonged period. This creates a security  hole, since the authenticated device can be used by another individual.  Many  mobile  devices  have  a  second  layer  of  security,  a  device  access  code, which is required after a short break in use, when the device shifts  to a dormant state. This code is trivial, typically a few digits or a pattern  on the screen.  Multifactor authentication on mobile devices should use biometrics,  as in recently introduced fingerprint scans, or proximity to other items  such as smart cards. In any event, the mobile application developer faces  a clear challenge in authentication due to the manner of access. Users con- nect in multiple short bursts and access from a wide range of nonsecure  environments. Device sensors need to detect multiple biometric patterns,  preferably automatically, and force a reentry of complete authentication  parameters, once the separation between the user and device exceeds a  threshold, before authentication becomes truly reliable.  System and data security is ensured through a combination of authen- tication, authorization, and security monitoring. After a user is authenti- cated, computer systems typically use access control lists to authorize these  users to access permitted resources. Again, this approach made sense in the  traditional workplace environment, where users accessed the network from  an office machine. When users access resources from a mobile device, it is  important  to  introduce  the  concept  of  location-aware  authorization.  For  example, if the access to corporate data is from the business office, a sales- person can have authorization to access all sales data. However, if the access  is from a customer site, then the authorization should automatically extend  to only records about that customer and related products. In the absence of  a specified reason, and additional approvals, automatic access should not  be provided to all customer records. Even tighter control should be placed         230  Mobile Electronic Commerce  for access from undesirable locations. A tighter access control process will  prevent a stolen or misplaced device from being used to access a treasure  trove of valuable corporate data.  Many e-commerce apps store data on the mobile device to support  customer  use  when  connectivity  is  not  available.  Strict  limits  must  be  placed on data stored on devices, and retention rules should be enforced  in mobile applications, especially native applications that can store data  internally.  In  addition,  mobile  applications  share  hardware  space  with  many other applications, often downloaded by the user on a whim. It is  important that applications secure themselves and their data from other  authorized applications on the device  Floyd, 2006 .  12.6  Testing mobile applications Mobile applications have characteristics that make them susceptible to a  multitude of field problems. First, native mobile applications are designed  to take advantage of special hardware features. If these features are newly  introduced  and  nonstandard,  the  application  will  face  problems  when  deployed  in  the  field.  Second,  while  mobile  hardware  capabilities  have  increased tremendously in the past few years, they continue to have lim- ited battery power, depend on mobile networks offering widely varying  levels of connectivity, and often share resources on mobile devices with  other poorly behaved applications. Third, many mobile applications are  cloud  based,  and  problems  in  configuring  cloud  resources  can  impact  user  experience.  Some  of  the  issues  that  make  mobile  testing  different  from conventional software testing include the difficulty of setting up test  benches for touch interfaces and the need to test mobile apps in varied  mobile network and security environments  Muccini et al., 2012 . Hardware testing: A test for mobile applications should be conducted on  the  designated  class  of  hardware,  including  both  current  and  old  ver- sions  of  the  hardware.  It  is  possible  that  the  app  will  work  on  the  ver- sion of the hardware used in the lab, which could be quite different from  the wide variety of hardware configurations used in the real world. We  also need to consider user workarounds to hardware, including “jailbro- ken”  hardware, which uses nonstandard operating systems, and how the  app functions with modified hardware. In particular, developers need to  ensure that the app remains secure when used on a modified device. The  mobile app tester needs to determine the hardware configurations used  by the potential market, and the test bed should include hardware in all  these  configurations.  Since  it  is  expensive  to  acquire  all  versions  of  the  hardware, most initial testing is done on hardware emulators, software  that emulates the hardware. While these emulators can identify system  bugs, process steps, data transfer, and process delays involved, they lack         Chapter twelve:  Mobile electronic commerce development  231  the actual feel of the device and user interface impact on events such as the  chances of hitting the wrong button or the visibility of the screen display  in a brightly lit public space  Keynote, 2013 . In addition, most test benches  use programs that automatically enter user responses to test the applica- tion. Such programs were perfect for web-based forms entry, where users  typically enter alphanumeric data in fields, and follow up with a return  keystroke or press a button to submit data. Mobile devices use touch and  voice input and allow for gestures and camera scans. The test bench must  be able to simulate all these forms of data entry effectively. Installation  testing:  Mobile  apps  are  typically  downloaded,  installed,  and executed by users in one integrated process. The test must include  the download process time, installation success rate on devices hosting  other common applications, and the quality of the first interaction with  the applications. Due to the circumstances under which mobile apps are  installed, users do not have the time to resolve conflicts and do not go  through a long training and learning process to use the app. Connectivity  testing:  Mobile  app  performance  is  dependent  on  network  connectivity. A good test should simulate the real connectivity available  to your app in the market environment. In addition, the test should use  the bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss rates for your application on  the real-world network. Another critical issue in testing mobile applica- tions is the impact of firewalls and packet shaping between the real-world  user and your service. Load testing: Since mobile apps are accessed from portable devices, they  will be used by many users from different locations. Connectivity testing  should include the impact of log-ins from a geographic and access location  distribution that matches the expected customer profile. In addition, since  connections from individuals will follow a queuing pattern with highly  varying loads, simulation studies should be conducted to determine the  impact of peak and sustained demand for the service. Security testing: Mobile apps face extensive threats from focused hackers  and  scattershot  attacks.  Many  mobile  apps  are  accessed  from  personal  devices, and the design standard is to require the user enter authentica- tion information once and retain these data for future use. Stolen devices  have  been  used  to  access  secure  applications,  and  until  biometric  tools  are incorporated in these devices, mobile app developers need to consider  alternate means of security. A security test for mobile apps should con- sider the robustness of the application to compromise by social engineer- ing, intrusive hacking, and scattershot attacks. Crowdsourced testing: One model for testing mobile apps is based on a  crowdsourcing-type approach and is promoted by a new venture, Testlio.         232  Mobile Electronic Commerce  The business model offers a team of validated testers who have passed  a screening process and completed training. These testers will follow a  standard protocol to access from a globally distributed base and subject  a mobile app to a range of tests. The company claims access to nearly  10,000 types of mobile hardware configurations. The business submits a  report to the developer on the functionality and robustness of the app.  12.7  Mobile web application technologies 12.7.1  HTML5 The hyper-text markup language  HTML  is used to tag web pages and  enable them to be rendered on browsers. Tim Berners Lee, who worked  as an independent contractor at the Center for Nuclear Research  CERN   in  Geneva,  Switzerland,  proposed  an  interlinked  system  of  docu- ments based on hypertext and connected using net technology in 1989.  Hypertext is text that is linked to other text files and was proposed in  1945 by Vannevar Bush, and versions of hypertext were demonstrated by  Douglas Engelbart in 1968. Berners-Lee put these concepts together and  combined them with the basic approach outlined for a standard general- ized markup language  SGML , to create a system where text files could  be  created  independently,  and  linked  together  by  hyperlinks  to  other  documents,  creating  the  web  concept  of  “surfing”  for  information  and  at the same time eliminating the need to centrally manage a hierarchical  document structure. HTML was first proposed in 1991, with the Internet  Engineering  Task  Force   IETF   standard,  version  2.0  released  in  1995.  The most recent version of HTML is version 5, which includes many fea- tures for highly interactive websites. When considering the value of the  HTML5 standard, we should understand that the first version of HTML  did not even have a standard way of incorporating images in a document,  and even today, images are separate from a HTML tagged page. HTML 5  includes well-designed and integral support for a document object model   DOM  that segments the document presented in the browser in separate  units for convenient processing within the browser sandbox. As a result,  code in the browser sandbox, for example, JavaScript, can reliably interact  with page elements, based on user actions. While this could be designed  in  earlier  versions,  there  was  no  established  standard,  and  developers  could  never  be  certain  that  their  code  would  work  on  all  browsers,  or  even if a browser update would break the code, and render the website  useless. Another feature standardized in HTML5 is drag and drop, the  ability of the user to take an object displayed on the screen and move and  drop it on another part of the screen. This feature is especially useful in  touch-enabled interfaces.        Chapter twelve:  Mobile electronic commerce development  233  jQuery  12.7.2  JavaScript is used to code processes that can be executed within a browser.  They support dynamic web pages that are capable of rich user interac- tion. Pages containing JavaScript can complete business data processing  steps within the user’s browser, cleaning and streamlining data transfer  to  the  application  server.  User  experience  is  enhanced,  with  a  fast  act- ing,  richly  interactive  interface  on  a  web  browser.  Since  data  transfers  are   conducted  only  after  a  sequence  of  interactive  steps  is  completed,  the inherent latency of web applications is reduced. JavaScript was first  introduced by Netscape in 1995, as a feature available on the Netscape  browser.  It  is  a  scripting  language,  having  almost  nothing  in  common  with the multiplatform programming language Java. JavaScript code was  interpreted, that is, translated to machine code sequentially, on the user’s  browser. As a result, early versions were slow and could be not be used  for much beyond adding a few interactive features, such as drop-down  lists, to a static web page. Over time, JavaScript processing has improved  and  rich  interactive  interfaces  have  been  developed.  These  interfaces  function within the web browser’s JavaScript sandbox. JavaScript is also  used on the web server to code simple business processes using server- side scripting.  Web  applications  are  accessed  through  the  Internet,  and  users  pre- ferred  applications  that  offered  rich  interactions,  without  the  latency  of  web data transfers. Enhancements to the language, in particular, improve- ments in the speed of JavaScript processing on browsers, made it possible  to develop web applications that presented a highly interactive interface  on the user’s devices. JavaScript coding was popular with web developers  who  worked  in  a  highly  dynamic  e-commerce  environment  and  devel- oped systems that were continually fine-tuned. While traditional coders  viewed  the  language  as  poorly  designed,  and  unreliable,  the  language  became the dominant means of providing rich interactivity for websites. It  became common in the industry to use script modules to automate com- mon  website  features.  An  example  is  the  Spry  Library,  which  initially  provided chunks of reusable code to add special effects to web pages. Its  initial use was limited to web page enhancements, and JavaScript faced  some criticism for its security weaknesses, especially because of exploits  where it could be used to reach outside the browser sandbox and infect the  host machine.  It  returned  to  prominence  with  the  popularity  of  Asynchronous  JavaScript and XML  AJAX , where the segments of the web page could  be  processed  locally  on  the  user’s  browser.  AJAX  created  the  rich  web   interfaces  of  web  applications  like  the  Google  Maps  application.  New  libraries were developed to add additional features to websites by adding  prepackaged code modules.        234  Mobile Electronic Commerce  JavaScript modules  12.7.3  jQuery is a popular JavaScript library for document navigation and event  handling. One feature, traversal, makes it easy to write code that works  through the elements in a page. One use of this feature is to work through  all the fields in a form and ensure that data entered in the fields meet stan- dards. Since the code works on the browser, the test is performed when  data are entered, with no net latency or traffic, and only clean data are sent  to the business server. Another related feature, manipulation, allows the  code to replace or alter data in different elements of the page. The jQuery  architecture also supports the development of plug-ins for new features,  which  can  be  easily  added  to  a  site.  There  is  a  large  library  of  jQuery  plug-ins, and this makes it easy to develop a website with rich elements,  such as interactive calendars, calculators, or image galleries. Coding pro- ductivity  and  reliability  is  enhanced,  and  coding  maintenance  cost  is  reduced by writing once and reusing the code. In jQuery, the approach  is to reuse rather than to write, that is, to use prebuilt components and  patch them together into a working site, rather than to write code. Since  this approach uses tried and tested code modules, not only does it reduce  the time to develop the code but also turn out to be more reliable than  home-grown code. An interesting study comparing the education effec- tiveness of mobile in-class interaction showed significant improvements  from a mobile app, which incidentally was built using the jQuery frame- work  Kert, 2013 .  12.7.4  Courses MIT App Inventor is a web-based platform that provides a drag-and-drop  interface to design a mobile device application. It is designed to teach the  basics of app development to students working on their first program- ming  course,  especially  high  school  students.  The  interface  is  limited,  but  easy  to  learn.  The  Stanford  iPhone  App  Development  course  is  a  full-fledged undergraduate course in iPhone Application Programming   CS193P   using  Objective  C,  the  language  used  for  Mac  OS X  and  iOS  development,  and  focuses  on  developing  mobile  applications  for  the  Apple  iPhone.  It  is  an  intense  course  and  requires  prior  knowledge  of  computer  programming  using  a  procedural  programming  language.  Stanford  has  a  couple  of  prerequisite  courses  that  are  also  offered  through  iTunes  University.  The  course  has  been  offered  online,  in  the  semester format, since winter 2009. While the course is offered for credit  to Stanford students, lectures have been posted on iTunes University for  public access. Another course recognizes the multidisciplinary nature of  mobile app use and focuses on bringing together students from diverse  backgrounds to build mobile apps  Massey et al., 2006 .        Chapter twelve:  Mobile electronic commerce development  235  12.8  Summary Developing applications for mobile e-commerce is in many ways similar to  developing other applications. E-commerce applications tend to have many  cloud-based  components  and  depend  on  effective  interaction  with  other  businesses. Mobile applications need to consider usage context differences  in location, interaction, and interface. As a rule, due to the short half-life  of mobile applications and the need to satisfy rapidly changing consumer  tastes, mobile  applications are built using rapid  application development  techniques, with many prebuilt plug-in modules and cloud-based services.  Another challenge for mobile e-commerce developers is the need to enhance  app performance on different types of hardware, using custom routines.  A  mobile  application  developer  can  choose  to  build  a  web-based  application, customized for mobile device screens, and limit customiza- tion to screen size and touch input. Since many laptops are being touch  enabled, and large size tablets are becoming popular for web browsing,  the  resulting  web  application  could  become  truly  cross-platform.  The  other approach is to build a native app utilizing hardware-specific fea- tures and gain richly interactive performance. This approach is required  for gaming and immersive applications and economical for widely used  business applications. In many e-business situations, a hybrid approach  can be used where web applications are developed, with small native apps  that enrich the view part of the model, using custom hardware features to  improve interaction richness.

Rich media  advertisements  delivered  on  mobile  allow  consumers  to  interact  with  the adver tisement in a nonintrusive manner  Barnes, 2002: pp. 399–419 .  For example, users could tap to watch a video, get a 360  view of a product,  locate a store, call a dealer, and return gracefully to the content. Higher  Internet speeds make the user experience better, but rich media technol- ogy has evolved to an extent where immersive user experience is  possible  even  at  lower  data  speeds.  Also,  multimedia  messaging  service   MMS   facility available in majority of handsets provides a good opportunity for  the modern advertisers to reach to the consumers as these ads are stored   *  We  hold  the  copyright  of  the  present  chapter  titled  Mobile  Advertising:  The  Indian  Perspective.

Corporate brands in India are using the capabilities of the mobile  phone to deliver engaging experience to consumers  Sharma et al., 2008 . The number of mobile phones in use is also growing much faster than  the number of computers. According to the report of Telecom Regulatory  Authority  of  India   TRAI   on  the  Indian  Telecom  Services  Performance  Indicators, January–March  2013 , released in August 2013, there are more  than  867.80  million  mobile  phone  subscribers  with  an  urban  subscriber  share  of  60.11%  and  a  rural  share  of  39.89%.  This  is  more  than  70%  pen- etration rate for the country. The Internet and Mobile Association of India   IAMAI  reported  2013  that there are 46 million active mobile Internet users  in India, a statistic that suggests that mobile Internet users have already sur- passed the desktop Internet users by a huge margin. According to a report  published  by  Associated  Chambers  of  Commerce  and  Industry  of  India   ASSOCHAM  in December 2012, there were only 23.1 million PC Internet  users in India at the end of June 2012  Broadband for India, 2012 . Although  there is a contradictory report from research firm Juxt that says that there  are only 23.8 million active mobile Internet users in India  Juxt, 2013 .  Currently, there are around 13 network operators providing mobile  communication services in India including the two public service under- takings  PSU , BSNL and MTNL. Private operators hold around 87.78%  of the wireless market share  based on subscriber base , whereas the PSU  operators hold only 12.22% market share. At present, prepaid subscribers  account for 96% of the total mobile subscribers in India. Out of the total  150 million Internet users in India, there were around 87.1 million mobile  Internet users till December 2012, and this number is expected to reach  130.6  million  by  March  2014  and  164.8  million  by  March  2015   Indian  Media and Entertainment Industry Report, 2012 .  The average monthly consumption of a normal mobile user who uses  her wireless device to access Internet is approximately Rs. 198. According  to  a  Gartner  Report  titled  “Forecast:  Mobile  Advertising,  Worldwide,  2009–2016”  released  in  November  2012,  India  is  slated  to  develop  into  the  biggest  smartphone  market  by  2017  next  only  to  China  and  the  United States. Also, at present, about 6% of the total mobile phone users   67  million  in India use smartphones to access wireless communication  services, and the number is slated to grow at an astounding rate of 52% in  the coming years  Gartner, 2012 .  Mobile users carry their devices to almost everywhere they go and  this  gives  this  medium  an  edge  over  traditional  devices  such  as  televi- sions or personal computers. Mobile advertisements develop their selling  points based on the relevance of the advertisement to the target audiences.  Park asserts that most advertisers believe that the advertiser’s waste in case  of traditional advertising is more than half the amount spent as it does not  reach to the desired audiences  Park, 2005: pp. 63–80 .        Chapter thirteen:  Mobile advertising  243  The issue with online advertising regarding the efforts and money is  that almost half of all the online advertisements are sold on a pay-per-click  basis, which means that advertisers pay only when consumers click on an  advertisement; however, it is not an effective format as its measurability is  minuscule. The advertising through text messages using mobile platform  is more focused and if the marketers use mobile firms’ profiles of the sub- scribers intelligently, they can tailor their  advertisements to match the  habits of individual subscribers  Hackley, 2010: pp. 29–33 . Furthermore,  when users consume content on the mobile Internet, through either mobile  websites or mobile applications, they provide an opportunity for advertis- ers to reach out to their target audience  Tahtinen, 2006: pp. 152–164 .  As a communication medium, mobile is fundamentally different and  more interactive than other media on all counts that matter to advertis- ers—availability,  targeting,  engagement,  and  measurement   Bulander  et al., 2005 .  The mobile is an extremely personal device that most of us tend to  access every moment we are awake. This gives advertisers access to their  target  audience  nearly  24  ×  7.  Mobile  offers  better  targeting  than  other  communication media. Advertisers can target their audience based on the  type of mobile device  basic phone feature phone smartphone  they use,  operator they use, and operating system, in addition to the usual target- ing and segmentation variables that exist for other media  Harte, 2008:  pp. 43–49 .  Mobiles  also  have  immense  computing  power,  4.3″  screens,  touch- screen capability, and sensors such as accelerometers, gyros, in addition  to technologies such as GPS. All these elements allow for creative adver- tisement  formats  and  immersive  engagement.  Unlike  other  media,  the  friction between engagement and call to action is nearly nonexistent for  mobile,  given  it  is  a  communication  device  at  the  core.  Mobile  enables  tracking and measurement at a far greater level compared to conventional  media. Advertisers  can easily track the number of seconds a consumer  spent on viewing a video, or the percentage of consumers that chose a par- ticular product or service  Leppaniemi and Karjaluoto, 2005: pp. 197–213 .  13.2  Mobile advertising—a conceptual framework Mobile  refers  to  any  portable  wireless  communication  device  capable  of delivering multifarious messages to the end users. The communica- tion  may  be  one-way  or  two-way  and  involves  two  or  more  than  two  persons.  The  messages  may  range  from  basic  text  and  voice  messages  to  rich  multimedia  messages.  In  the  past  few  decades,  mobile  phones  have  achieved  phenomenal  success  in  the  field  of  human  communica- tion owing to their inherent characteristic of portability and increasing  affordability  resulting  from  the  introduction  of  cheaper  technologies.         244  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Technological advancements witnessed in the last few years have cata- pulted mobile phones into a different league altogether  Noonam, 2001 .  Modern mobile phones have evolved from simple communication devices  to advanced gadgets employed for accessing the Internet, reading books,  teleconferencing, video chatting, and a lot more. Worldwide, the number  of mobile phone users is growing at lightning pace outpacing even the  growth in the number of personal computer users. According to Internet  Advertising  Bureau’s   IAB    2013   Internet  Advertising  Outlook  Report  2013, in 2012 the number of personal computer users globally declined by  4% than in 2011. The same report also proclaims that in 2012 about 15% of  the total web traffic was on mobile phones. Mobile phones have become  the order of the day in developing countries like India where these devices  have been successful in filling the communication gaps and are proving  helpful in bridging the digital divide. Mobile phones have now become  items  of  necessity  for  the  common  public   Clay  and  Zainubhai,  2013:  pp. 84–87 . According to a report published on an Indian news website  ibnlive.in.com on September 8, 2013, the number of actual mobile users in  India at present is 554.8 million  Juxt, 2013 . This means that nearly half of  the Indian populace has access to the mobile phones making it the most  preferred  communication  device  for  the  masses.  An  interesting  datum  mentioned by the website is that there are more rural mobile subscrib- ers than the urban ones. That is, approximately 54% or 298 million active  subscribers belong to rural India. The combination of factors discussed  earlier provides an opportunity to businesses to reach to a wide assort- ment of customers through mobile advertising in a cost-effective manner. Mobile  advertising  refers  to  any  legitimate  paid  personal  or  non- personal  promotional  message s  sent  by  an  identifiable  advertiser  to  the  end  user.  The  concept  of  legitimacy  is  attached  with  the  concept  of  mobile  advertising  because  mobile  phones  are  distinctly  personal  devices  and  unwanted  promotional  messages  are  perceived  as  an  infringement  of  privacy  by  the  customers.  It  is  the  dissemination  of  multifarious text, voice, or multimedia messages to one or more existing  or  potential  customers  through  mobile  phones  and  devices.  Basically,  mobile  advertising  refers  to  the  advertising  and  marketing  activities  that deliver advertisements to mobile devices using wireless networks,  the advertising solutions to promote the sales of goods and services, and  a marketing strategy to build brand awareness. Mobile advertising cre- ates a new media channel to conduct product and business advertising  and marketing through mobile devices such as mobile phones, personal  digital assistant  PDA , and tablet pocket PC  Lawrence, 2008 . Mobile  advertising includes advertising through mobile Internet, mobile banner  ads,  mobile  search  engine  advertising,  mobile  portals,  mobile  in-apps  advertising,  rich  media  mobile  advertisements,  multimedia  advertis- ing  messages,  advertising  through  mobile  radio television  broadcasts,         Chapter thirteen:  Mobile advertising  245  and  spillover  Internet print  advertising,  that  is,  the  advertisements  meant originally for the desktops or print media but accessed on mobile.  Mobile advertising provides the businesses with an opportunity to pro- mote augment or reinforce their corporate as well as product brand in a  cost-effective manner with great degree of personalization and custom- ization  Denk and Hackl, 2004: pp. 460–470 .  Mobile  advertising  has  already  become  one  of  the  fastest  growing  forms of advertising in the developed world. According to IAB’s Internet  Advertising Revenue Report 2010–2012, the total mobile ad spend in the  United  States  by  the  mid-year  2012  was  $1200  million  representing  a  growth of 95% on a year-on-year basis. Mobile advertising has several dis- tinguishing features that provide a significant edge over other media used  for advertising. The most important features that it offers to the adver- tiser are that it is portable and is always on unlike other advertising media  such as television or radio  Tsang et al., 2004: pp. 65–78 . The chances of  messages  being  lost  due  to  the  device  being  switched  off  are  consider- ably less in comparison with other media. Mobile phones or devices are  characteristically personal in nature and carry the user’s identity making  it possible to track the individual characteristics of the user. This means  that customized marketing messages may be delivered to the existing or  potential  customers   Dholakia  and  Dholakia,  2004:  pp.  1391–1396 .  This  also provides an opportunity for promotion of taboo goods such as con- traceptives, products related to personal hygiene, and so on in a cultur- ally sensitive society like India  Terence et al., 2013: pp. 46–49 . Modern  tracking technologies have paved way for real-time tracking of the physi- cal location of the user making user centric advertising and customized  advertising messages an effective reality. For example, if a user uses her  mobile’s GPS service to search for a book store, then she may be targeted  with advertisements for book stores and since she is searching for one, the  advertisement may generate an actual sale. Another important attribute  of the mobile advertisements is that a number of different mobile adver- tisements can be comfortably stored in the memory of the device and can  be accessed by the user at an appropriate moment even after considerable  lapse of time. For instance, a user may save a number of text messages  pertaining to tour and travels services provided by different service pro- viders and may use them while planning for her vacation  Kalakota and  Robinson, 2002 .  However,  despite  having  a  long  list  of  advantages  attached  to  it,  mobile advertising does pose some challenges in front of the advertisers.  The first and foremost is the difference in the quality of mobile phones  being  used  by  different  customers.  That  is,  depending  on  the  purchas- ing  capacity,  a  customer  may  purchase  a  basic  feature  phone,  while  another customer may have a gadget overflowing with apps. The factors  such as different screen sizes, variations in the speed of the processors,         246  Mobile Electronic Commerce  and  different  connectivity  plans  render  it  difficult  for  the  advertis- ers  to  produce  universal  advertisements  suitable  for  different  kinds  of  devices.  The  scope  for  creativity  is  delimited  by  comparatively  smaller  display areas than traditional advertising media such as newspapers and   television. Also, for the same reason the information provided is also not  as comprehensive as in other media. Nevertheless, for brand augmenta- tion and reinforcement and customer retention, it is an excellent medium  as a large number of messages may be sent to a large number of custom- ers superseding the geographical boundaries, and a database of the loyal  customers may be maintained and retained by businesses by continually  providing the existing loyal customers pertinent information regarding  the changes taking place in the realm of their preferred brands and vari- ous promotional schemes and offers  Yuan and Tsao, 2003: pp. 399–414 .  Indian market and industry dynamics  13.3  According to a report jointly published by PricewaterhouseCoopers  PWC   and Confederation of Indian Industry  CII  in 2012, the mobile advertising  market is at a significantly evolved stage in developed markets as com- pared to India. Countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom,  Japan, and China are considerably ahead of India in mobile advertising. In  fact, in many developed countries, the size of mobile advertising market  is comparable to the television broadcast advertising market. This is due  to high mobile Internet penetration and usage across almost all sections  of the society.  Nearly  all  the  key  markets  such  as  the  United  States,  the  United  Kingdom, Japan, and China are expected to exhibit strong growth rates  as consumers continue to spend significant amounts of their time online  on mobile. As far as India is concerned, it has a fledgling market at the  moment with a current spend at 33 million US$. But with smartphones  increasingly becoming the norm and adoption of 3G and 4G expected to  increase further, the mobile advertising market is expected to continue to  grow at a rapid pace of 40% by the end of 2014. Despite having more than  120 million mobile Internet users in the country, a majority of advertisers  are not yet exploring the medium at all bringing the overall digital spends  in India at 5%–7% of overall advertising pie, which is pegged at 5 billion  US$ to 5.1 US$  PWC and CII, 2012 .  Mobile advertising is an exciting, fast-growing category, but its share  in the overall advertising pie is exiguous. Presently, it is growing at a rapid  pace and is expected to grow faster than many of its peers over the next few  years. The driving factors include increasing adoption and usage of mobile  Internet  from  a  low  base  and  rising  interest  level  of  advertisers.  India’s  mobile Internet advertising market is expected to grow even more rapidly  as the global trend of increasing adoption of smartphones and high-speed         Chapter thirteen:  Mobile advertising  247  mobile data access is being witnessed in India as well and  this will lead  advertisers to follow the target audiences on this platform.  The experts of mobile advertising often argue that one of the first chal- lenges that mobile advertising faces in becoming a marketing medium is  the absence of a widely accepted metric that can gauge how the medium  has delivered for those who have invested in it and become a currency.  Value-added  services,  promotions  on  mobile,  new  mobile  applications,  display, search, and SMS MMS are the key drivers contributing to mobile  advertising spends in India, and are expected to help boost the market  from  50  million  US$  to  75–80  million  US$  by  the  end  of  2013   Mobile  Advertising Spend Report for India, 2012 .  Marking a notable growth of 12.6% in 2012, the Indian media and enter- tainment industry grew from US$ 11.90 billion in 2011 to US$ 13.42 billion  in 2012. With an increase of 9%, the total advertising expenditure across  media stood at US$ 5.36 billion in 2012. The print advertising leads with  46% of the total advertising pie at US$ 2.45 billion. Covering nearly 80%  of advertising market in India, the conventional advertising media news- papers and television were the preferred media by the advertisers, even  though Internet advertising showed substantial increase with a 7% share  in the total advertising spend in 2012  PWC and CII, 2012 .  Out  of  the  total  online  advertising  spend  in  2012,  search  advertis- ing alone accounted for about 38%, that is, US$ 139.10 million while dis- play advertising formed a considerable 29%  US$ 108.34 . The market for  advertisements delivered on mobile phones and tablets has grown to 10%  amounting  to  spends  of  around  US$  37.64  million  of  the  Indian  online  advertising market in FY 2012–2013 with a growth of 3% from the previ- ous financial year 2011–2012. Other advertising formats like social media  witnessed  a  13%  share  in  the  online  advertising  market,  while  email  advertising accounted for 3%. Video conferencing advertising witnessed  a 7% share, respectively  Global Mobile Advertising Spends, 2012 .  The reasons behind the mobile advertising market’s growth in India  are external to the advertising environment. Mobile handsets are increas- ingly  becoming  cheaper  leading  to  greater  accessibility  for  the  masses.  Another reason for growth is the introduction of new mobile data plans,  which  has  allowed  access  to  the  Internet  on-the-go  at  comparatively  affordable rates starting as low as Rs. 10 per day. Mobile, as a consequence  of the aforementioned factors, has now evolved from just being a commu- nication device into a much more advanced medium capable of delivering  an assortment of rich multimedia messages  Okazaki, 2005: pp. 160–180 .  In addition to the external changes occurring on the consumer’s side,  the  advertisers  have  also  realized  the  utility  of  mobile  as  an  effective  advertising platform. Five years ago, although there was excitement about  the medium, there were not as many avenues as there are now. The rea- sons at the consumer and the advertiser end coupled together have made         248  Mobile Electronic Commerce  mobile a lethal combination for both the advertisers and the consumers.  With the introduction of 3G in 2012 and now 4G, the market grew even  more significantly as the users are now being introduced to better services  with better connectivity.  The mobile advertising market has evolved from a stage of communica- tion to a stage of entertainment. Now it has become the preferable tool to get  instant access to the content. The difference between India and other coun- tries is that it is a mobile-first market. In India, for many people, the first  Internet experience is on the mobile, making it the primary mode of content  consumption. This is in contrast with other developed countries where the  first Internet experience is on the computer  Yunos and Jerry, 2008 .  The game plan for the mobile advertising companies in India is  simple.  They  create  money  in  two  ways—one  by  creating  the  technology  and  products around the mobile advertising market and another by having  partnership with publishers to place advertisements. Thus, the companies  provide the advertisers and brands with an end-to-end holistic mobile ad  campaign, by creating larger supply at one end and large demand at the  other  Pura, 2002: pp. 62–71 .  One  of  the  largest  sectors  in  mobile  advertising  is  the  automobile  industry—with  brands  such  as  Maruti,  Honda,  and  Yamaha  engag- ing in mobile advertising. FMCG brands such as Unilever, PepsiCo, and  Coca Cola, and telecommunication advertisers such as Nokia, Samsung,  Karbonn,  and  Micromax,  follow  the  automobile  industry.  The  top  five  spending  brands  in  India  in  mobile  advertising  industry  in  2012  were  Maruti Suzuki, Nokia, PepsiCo, Coca Cola, and Unilever  On Device and  Decision Fuel, 2012 .  13.4  Key trends in mobile advertising in India Mobile  advertising  is  slated  for  a  phenomenal  rise  across  the  globe  in  the  next  few  decades.  India,  a  country  with  the  second  largest  mobile  phone subscriber base next only to China, and way ahead of most devel- oped countries and inherent characteristics such as democracy, humon- gous consumer market, and an economy growing at a considerable pace,  is going to be one of the most crucial and exciting playgrounds for mobile  advertisers  Lee, 2013: pp. 231–247 . India has certain unique features that  distinguish her from other developing countries. It is a complex market  with attributes of developed nations interspersed with those of develop- ing and sometimes even of underdeveloped countries. An example of this  phenomenon is that, according to a Reuters report, a number of India’s  dollar  millionaires  will  cross  the  4  million  mark  by  2015,  while  on  the  other hand, the number of people suffering from poverty in India is also  very high and if the recent planning commission of India data is believed  nearly 27%  approximately 320 million  of the population is living below         Chapter thirteen:  Mobile advertising  249  the poverty line  Reuters, 2012 . However, according to TRAI data, almost  75%  approximately 900 million  Indians have access to mobile phones.  Even  if  the  conservative  estimates  given  by  a  report  published  on  an  Indian news website ibnlive.com quoting PTI are considered, the number  of active mobile subscribers in India is almost 600 million. Out of these,  approximately 23 million consumers access the Internet from their mobile  phones. This is a big number considering that most countries do not even  have this much population. The fact that Indian market is huge cannot be  contested; however, it is still nascent and to fully explore the market and  realize its true potential we need to understand the key trends that are  going to shape the future of Indian mobile advertising.  Subscriber  base—and  more  significantly  active  subscriber  base— in India is going to increase rapidly throughout the next decade and is  not going to witness a downward spiral in the near future. This is due  to a combination of factors such as availability of cheaper feature mobile  phones as well as smartphones, declining access costs, lack of alternate  modes of communication, and the impetus provided by the central gov- ernment as well as the state governments to increase the penetration of  mobile  subscribers  in  India.  Mobile  phones  have  the  advantage  of  por- tability and affordability in comparison to personal computers and even  laptops  Basu, 2000: pp. 83–99 . Also, almost all the basic feature phones  besides the smartphones are Internet ready and provide an opportunity to  anyone with an investment capacity of as low as Rs. 2000 to buy a feature  mobile phone and a monthly spending capacity of around Rs. 100 to access  the world of information through the Internet. Smartphone pricing wars  have commenced with companies like Apple, which used to focus more  on product than affordability, coming up with cheaper products for mass  markets like India. Apple’s Ipad 5C is priced as low as $99. Smartphones  from  Indian  companies  like  Micromax,  Karbonn,  etc.,  start  at  prices  as  low  as  Rs.  3000,  and  even  multinationals  like  Samsung,  LG,  and  HTC  have considerably affordable smartphone range. These low prices coupled  with  comparatively  cheaper  accessibility  costs  translate  into  a  lucrative  market for mobile advertisers.  Telecom giants like Airtel, Vodafone, Reliance, and Tata have already  invested thousands of crores of rupees to acquire 3G licences, and Airtel  has even launched its 4G services in metros like Mumbai. They will have  to  monetize  their  investment  by  popularizing  mobile  broadband  data  plans and in a price-sensitive Indian market overflowing with cutthroat  competition. This means that consumers will be the winner and have data  plans to access the Internet that are within their reach. At present, accord- ing to a recent report published by an Indian news website quoting PTI,  the number of active Internet users in India is nearly 144 million and only  a  very  small  portion  to  these  users,  that  is,  only  approximately  23  mil- lion of them use the Internet through mobile. Given the affordability of         250  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Internet-ready smartphones in comparison with the laptops or personal  computers, the number is bound to increase and even smaller efforts on  the part of the data plan providers may catapult the number into a differ- ent orbit altogether  Juxt, 2013 .  A distinctive feature of the Indian Internet users is that the number  of those who have accessed the Internet for the first time through mobile  phones is greater than those who have done it through personal  computers.  This is due to triple factors of affordability, accessibility, and availability.  India has the second largest mobile subscriber base next only to China,  and this is going to increase further, as in order to bring about transpar- ency in the administrative system, the Indian government is pushing for  e-governance initiatives and innovations, and once its ambitious Adhaar  Project is completed, most of the government services will be shifted to  the online platform. This will make the Internet access a necessity instead  of  a  luxury,  and  affordability  of  mobile  Internet  will  be  a  big  factor  in  deciding the medium through which the masses access the Internet. This  will give a boost to the rural market. The advent and maturing of rural  markets will force the development of content in regional languages.  Regional  language  content  would  provide  an  opportunity  for  the  advertisers  to  reach  to  the  masses.  Area-specific  targeting  would  also  become  possible  as  there  is  little  possibility  that  an  ad  designed  in  Malayalam  would  be  accessed  by  the  Marathi  speaking  people.  This  along with the fact that the advertisement will be sent only to the mobile  numbers  belonging  to  consumers  in  Kerala  state   whose  native  tongue  is Malayalam  would minimize the wastage. Indian consumers are lan- guage sensitive and content in their language would be more emotionally  appealing to them than in any other language.  Mobile-based e-commerce will also gain momentum in the coming  decades.  According  to  Master  Card  Mobile  Payment  Readiness  Index   MPRI ,  India  ranked  21st  among  34  countries  with  a  score  of  31.5  on  a  scale  of  100.  This  index  also  points  out  that  only  14%  of  Indian  con- sumers are familiar with P2P and m-commerce transactions and only a  meager 10% are familiar with POS transactions. However, these percent- ages  are  bound  to  increase  owing  to  growing  mobile  penetration,  ease  of transactions, increasing Internet literacy, and impetus provided by the   government. The Finance Ministry of India has directed the Indian Public  Sector Banks to focus on mobile and Internet banking to minimize cash  transactions  in  order  to  tackle  the  problem  of  fake  currency,  minimize  black market transactions, and bring about transparency in the financial  transactions  MPRI, 2012 . Indian e-commerce websites like flipkart.com,  jabong.com, etc., are witnessing a growth in their revenues on a daily basis.  Mobile recharges, DTH service recharges, and travel bookings are gaining  popularity day by day and are among the fastest growing e- commerce  transactions in India  ERNST and YOUNG, 2012 .        Chapter thirteen:  Mobile advertising  251  Price sensitivity is also a key factor in the context of mobile  advertising  and the fact that even the slightest of variations in price may drive the con- sumers away means that value-added services and free applications will  be the order of the day. A new trend will be the blurring of the boundaries  between the mobile advertising and the mobile applications. For example,  if an advertiser of automobiles wants to establish and augment its brand  among the youngsters, that advertiser may device games that target the  audience that the advertiser wants to focus upon. The advantage would  be that if the game gets popularized then it will not be intrusive upon  the privacy of the customer and this will lead to the creation of favorable  brand image of the company in the minds of the existing as well as the  prospective customers  Tao et al., 2013: pp. 2536–2544 .  Privacy is a big concern for the consumers, and advertising messages  that  infringe  upon  their  privacy  may  drive  them  away  and  may  even  antagonize them toward the brand. It will be incumbent upon the mobile  service providers as well as the advertisers to respect the privacy of the  consumers  and  take  prior  consent  of  the  consumers  before  advertising  to them  Hyunsook, 2012 . In India, the TRAI has already formed strict  rules  regarding  unwanted  messages,  and  companies  neglecting  them  may entail heavy fines and may have to pay damages to the customers.  This may be disastrous for the company as not only will it incur financial  losses but its reputation will also suffer greatly. One way to address the pri- vacy concern of the consumers is to follow companies like Life Insurance  Corporation  of  India,  which  asks  prior  permission  of  the  consumers  to  contact them. This not only generates goodwill among the consumers, but  also establishes the brand as someone who shares the concerns of the con- sumers regarding privacy  Barwise and Strong, 2002: pp. 14–24 .  These are the key trends that are going to shape the future of mobile   advertising in India.  13.5  Mobile advertising strategies India is a tremendous market for mobile advertising. One of the key rea- sons for the mobile advertising wave in India is that almost 87% of Internet  users access the Internet through mobile. The mobile Internet user base  in India is increasing day-by-day and will fast approach the 200 million  mark by the end of 2016  Page, 2013 . Around 40% of all mobile Internet  users in India have mobile as their only Internet access point. Their first  Internet experience is on mobile as the mobile Internet accounts for 59.36%  of the total Internet usage in India, as of December 2012, while Desktop  Internet  accounted  for  40.64%  of  the  total  Internet  usage  in  India.  This  revolution is being driven by the proliferation of mobile applications that  are driving the mobile ecosystem, similar to the manner in which web- sites powered desktop Internet  KPCB, 2012 .        252  Mobile Electronic Commerce  The  market  trends  that  drive  mobile  advertising  in  India  concern  with  smart  mobile  advertising.  Advertisers  are  devoting  more  time  to  evaluate the mobile usage practices and psychographics of audiences to  produce  nifty  advertising  campaigns  that  could  effortlessly  and  effec- tively establish a bond with the customers, irrespective of the mobile plat- form the consumer use rather than focusing only on smartphones, with  an  increase  in  the  demand  of  mobile  applications  coming  from  emerg- ing markets like India and China with a 36% market share in terms of  downloads in 2010. It is the second largest market share in the whoop- ing  6.8  billion  US$  market   World  Mobile  Application  Market  Report  2010–2015,  2012 .  Thus,  developers  are  initiating  strategies  to  generate  revenues  from  their  applications’  user  base  by  integrating  them  with  telecommunication billing for microtransactions and are candidly using  potent mobile advertising solutions.  Consumer’s mobile lifestyle is allowing the brands to converge adver- tising,  distribution,  and  transactions  over  multiple  delivery  platforms   Grunewald,  2013 .  Today,  brands  have  the  opportunity  to  leverage  the  mobile for all the 4Ps of marketing. Combined with the microtransaction  capability of mobile, mobile coupons  m-coupons  are already altering the  pricing  paradigm  with  hyper-segmented  offers.  m-coupon  is  a  mobile  solution that enables customers to receive, save, and redeem coupons on  their  mobile  phones.  The  m-coupon  applications  are  mostly  integrated  with other mobile applications and social media websites like foursquare  to extract, save, and redeem coupons at the point of sale, anywhere and  anytime. m-coupons is a loyalty solution that helps to reach out to a wide  consumer  base  by  reducing  the  delivery  cost  of  coupons  and  improve  redemption  efficiency.  m-coupons  can  be  quickly  accessed  and  can  enhance new revenue flow through brand marketing and promotion. This  is blurring the lines between advertising, distribution, and transaction.  The mobile advertising strategy most preferably in practice these days  is to deliver personal messages based on the consumer’s local time, loca- tion, and preferences. Location independence and ubiquity are the two  key  arguments  for  mobile  advertising.  Properly  applied,  location-based  advertising services can create or reinforce virtual communities. A per- sonalized SMS campaign relies upon databases with enough active and  potential clients to reach the target group profitably. A database contain- ing information about the clients such as leisure activities, holidays, music  and media interests, type of Internet access, occupation, marital status, car  ownership, and income will help the advertisers to engage clients in an  interesting way  Zanton, 1981: pp. 141–146 .  While strategizing mobile advertising campaigns, advertisers have to  take care of consumer control, permission, and privacy. There is a hitch that  the mobile operators have lot of personal information about their clients  that would be of great interest to advertisers, but privacy laws may prevent         Chapter thirteen:  Mobile advertising  253  them from sharing it. There is a further trade-off between  personalization  and  consumer  control.  Gathering  data  required  for  tailoring  messages  raises privacy concerns. The corporate mobile  advertising strategies and  policies should consider legalities such as electronic signatures, electronic  contracts, and conditions for sending SMS MMS. According to the experts  of mobile advertising, advertisers should take permission and should con- vince  the  consumers  to  opt-in  before  sending  advertisements.  A  simple  registration ensures sending relevant messages to an interested audience.  The  advertisers,  mobile  operators,  and  middlemen  have  not  agreed  on  a common format for the sharing of this  information, neither they have  worked out how to share the revenue it might yield.  Unsolicited  advertising  messages,  commonly  known  as  spam,  sti- fle  user  acceptance,  particularly  as  mobile  phones  cannot  distinguish  between spam and genuine communication automatically. An important  problem  with  mobile  advertising  is  that  consumers  are  used  to  ads  on  television and radio but they consider their mobile phone a more personal  device. A flood of advertising might offend its audience, and thus under- mine its own value. Tolerance of advertising also differs from one market  to another  De Moij, 1998 . In the Middle East, unsolicited text messages  are quite common, and do not prompt many complaints, but subscribers  might not prove to be so open-minded in Europe or America.  The cultural and personal mindset of the consumer is also an area of  concern to strategize mobile advertising. Consumers in India, especially  the  rural  consumers,  are  still  hesitant  in  using  mobile  banking,  mobile  payments, and m-commerce. A positive shift is required to make them  comfortable  with  mobile-based  e-transactions.  For  this,  a  consumer- focused  solution  is  required.  The  transactions  should  be  maintained  with the highest levels of performance and security. The payment gate- ways should be incorporated with specially designed functions enabling  various parties involved in the issuance of mobile applications to mobile  phones  to  securely  provision  those  applications.  Payment  options  like  contactless payment card applications using NFC, peer-to-peer payments  applications  should  be  designed  in  such  a  way  that  they  are  compliant  with emerging industry mandates and standards of due care in order to  infuse a sense of security in the minds of the consumers.  Mobile advertising should be designed innovatively with an excep- tional use of audio and video to make it as a part of a rich media cam- paign. World Bank data reveal that in middle- to low-income economies,  there are as many as three times the numbers of mobile subscribers per  100 people as those with Internet access  ICT Facts and Figures by ITU &  World  Bank,  2012,  The  World  in  2013 .  Moreover,  studies  conducted  by  two digital marketing research firms Insight Express and Dynamic Logic  in  2012  also  showed  that  mobile  campaigns  were  found  to  be  four  to  five  times  more  effective  than  PC  Internet  campaigns  against  standard         254  Mobile Electronic Commerce  brand metrics such as unaided awareness, message association, and even   purchase intent  Insight Express and Dynamic Logic, 2012 .  An  effective  mobile  advertising  strategy  for  reaching  consumers  in developing markets like India needs to target smartphones and tab- lets with engaging rich media content. It further requires a fine balance  between  rich  media  content  and  the  available  bandwidth  so  that  the  advertisements would load fast. In the same way, to reach the masses, it is  important to engage the consumers on mobile sites, but advertisers can  engage the consumers more actively only when the ads will load quickly  on sites. The important point to be noted here is that without better con- nectivity at affordable rates mobile advertising will not be able to realize  its true potential in India.  The key to any mobile advertising strategy is to make sure that the  advertising units are designed for mobile users rather than designing it for  some other media like television or print and then adopting it for mobile  platforms. The strategies should be well supported by innovative ways to  target the audience, and care should also be taken to constantly analyze  and optimize the advertising campaigns delivered on mobile. Refreshing  the contents frequently will also help the advertisers to combat ad fatigue   Bansal et al., 2009 .  A  recent  consumer  research  study  conducted  by  InMobi,  a  mobile  customer  engagement  platform,  revealed  that  mobile  web  users  in  key  Asian  markets  such  as  Singapore,  Indonesia,  and  Malaysia  are  increas- ingly becoming more comfortable with accessing the Internet using their  mobile gadgets over desktop computers or laptops. This growth is driven  in large part by the use of social media on mobile. On an average, 21% of  mobile web usage time of consumers in these key Asian markets is spent  on social media. Social media usage is also the only mobile activity that  over 50% of mobile web users across these key markets expect to increase  their time spend on over the next 12 months. Interesting point to note here  is that social media consumption is largely categorized as entertainment  and is therefore associated with a more relaxed and receptive consumer  mindset. Users are, therefore, more open to explore content that is relevant  and attractive to them  InMobi, 2012 .  Thus, exploring and exploiting social media and its vital elements can  give a mobile advertising campaign an edge. Using Facebook or Twitter  buttons to share great promotions and interesting sites adds tremendous  value by reaching consumers at a time when they are most receptive to  such  content.  Moreover,  if  a  user  likes  the  campaign,  there  is  a  further  scope that he or she will recommend it to their friends who might in turn  pass it on to their contacts  Tuten, 2008 .  Tracking  the  advertising  campaign  is  also  very  important  point  to  consider  while  designing  the  strategies  for  mobile  advertising.  With  the  advances  taking  place  in  mobile  communications,  mobile  advertising         Chapter thirteen:  Mobile advertising  255  campaigns can also be tracked, measured, and optimized  Martin, 2011 .  The  key  effort  should  be  to  clearly  define  the  objectives  of  the  advertis- ing campaign and then to identify relevant metrics to measure that how  far these objectives have been achieved after delivering the campaign. The  metrics will also be useful to analyze performance or awareness-related  clicks, lead generation, and applications downloads or ad impressions, to  track the time spent watching videos and other engagement measurements.  A strategy for mobile advertising also requires a clear and strong campaign  message and well-designed mobile platform-oriented creatives to ensure  that consumers are engaged well with the campaign  Feldmann, 2005 .  Various mobile advertising firms are developing new standard mea- surement guidelines to bring mobile first on the mindset for the  advertisers  and to figure out how effective a mobile advertising campaign could be  for the consumers. With 3G and 3.5G facilities, advertisers can use video,  animation,  photo  galleries,  and  interactive  elements,  which  can  make  mobile advertising more akin to a television commercial or a slick maga- zine. Opera software, the mobile browser company, reported in July 2012  that users who clicked on a rich media ad spent an average of 52 s view- ing a video and 1 min and 25 s interacting with photos, respectively  State  of Mobile Web, 2012 . Opera report also points out that advertisers have  started using rich media and video advertisements more frequently in 2012  than the traditional banner advertisements.  Another promising part of mobile advertising is location-based prod- uct and service information delivered via geo-fencing or proximity. These  advertisements mostly catch a person at a time when he or she wants to  act and do not factor in a person’s preferences. The advertising strategies  are now designed mostly in and around location-based and search adver- tisements  Trimponias et al., 2013 . Advertising based on native content is  also gaining popularity among the advertisers. The advertisers are now  taking more interest in creating messages and content that work within  the flow of their delivery platforms. By using the social networking plat- forms like Facebook and Twitter, advertisers are linking their campaigns  with the existing units of content, like a tweet or update. This is an organic  and unique way to advertise through mobile that is harder to ignore.  Facebook  in  its  financial  statement  for  the  year  2012–2013  said  that  it gets 14% of all of its revenue via mobile-sponsored stories and install  advertisements, which appears right in the news stream of its mobile appli- cations  and  website.  E-Marketer,  a  digital  media  firm  offering  insights  essential to navigate the changing digital environment across the globe  in its report published in 2013, says that Twitter has made US$ 129.7 mil- lion in mobile advertising in the year 2012  The Global Media Intelligence  Report: Asia-Pacific, 2013 .  The experts of mobile advertising argue that mobile advertising strat- egy does not mean only placing the advertisements in an application or         256  Mobile Electronic Commerce  website appropriately but also to place advertisements alongside creative  activities inside the applications and websites. Advertisers like Pontiflex  and Tapjoy help people to earn in-application rewards for watching vid- eos,  installing  applications,  or  subscribing  to  services.  Advertisers  are  creating lock screens for Android devices that can be branded and poten- tially carry advertising. Smartphone users collectively swipe to unlock  their Android phones millions of times each day. Lock screen advertis- ing promises to make the act of unlocking more rewarding by paying  users  to  look  at  an  ad  before  getting  to  their  phone.  When  the  phone  is turned on, a user can swipe left to see a photo ad or watch a movie  trailer. The user can swipe right if he or she has no interest in seeing the  advertisements.  These  are  some  effective  mobile  advertising  strategies  for  reaching   consumers in emerging markets like India.  13.6    Cost-effective connectivity solutions  for mobile Internet  A population in excess of 3.7 billion coupled with highest Internet user  base in the world makes Asia arguably the most lucrative destination for  online advertisers including mobile advertisers. According to Internet  world  statistics,  Asia  had  more  than  650  million  broadband  users  in  2012, a number that has grown 469% since 2000. Major driver for this  exponential growth is increasing the availability of low cost, low band- width  wireless  solutions,  especially  in  business  sector.  According  to  latest TRAI Report, August 2013, there were approximately 900 million  mobile subscribers in India. That is, almost 75% of Indian populace has  access to mobile phones. However, only about 145 million Indians use  mobile to access the Internet; the number in itself is huge, but when put  besides the total mobile subscriber base in the country, it is miniscule.  For mobile advertising to become a full-fledged industry in India, it is  imperative  to  popularize  mobile  Internet  among  users.  This  is  not  an  easy task in a price-sensitive market like India, and therefore, low-cost  connectivity solutions will have to be developed and made accessible to  the users.  There is little doubt that the Internet Age has transformed the way  the world does the business. The e-Commerce market in India grew to  US$ 9.5 billion in 2012 and is expected to reach US$ 12.6 billion—a 34%  y-o-y growth since 2009  IAMAI, 2012 . These data give perspective to  the potential in the Indian mobile advertising industry. The opportuni- ties and tangible benefits it accords are now being quantified. Recent  studies  conducted  by  World  Bank  revealed  that  each  10%  increase  in         Chapter thirteen:  Mobile advertising  257  broadband  penetration  would  result  in  1.21%  increase  in  per  capita  GDP growth in developed countries and 1.38% increase in developing   countries. This suggests that the governments world over will also have  to look at providing low-cost connectivity solutions to their citizens and  online marketing and advertising industry will have to work in tandem  with governments to arrive at affordable connectivity solutions.  Asia is at the forefront of broadband innovation, and India is also  witnessing  a  notable  broadband  penetration  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas.  New  wireless  technology  offered  by  telecom  operators  has  brought  the  power  of  Internet  to  an  increasing  number  of  enterprises  and government agencies looking to implement cost-effective connectiv- ity  solutions.  These  technologies  have  brought  next  generation  broad- band network to the rural areas of developing countries that would not  be  served  otherwise   Ahonen,  2008 .  The  low-cost  wireless  broadband  solutions  provide  an  excellent  way  to  expand  network  connections  to  rural underserved areas of India, thereby boosting the mobile advertis- ing to a large extent.  Technology  like  Worldwide  Interoperability  for  Microwave  Access   WiMAX   is  now  expanding  very  quickly  in  India  and  is  providing  mature 3G and 4G mobile technology to the people at affordable cost. A  single WiMAX platform can support fixed, portable, and mobile broad- band services in scalable channel bandwidths from 5 to 20 MHz and can  support  security  features  through  mutual  device user  authentication,  flexible key management protocols, strong traffic encryption, and security  protocol optimization for fast handovers  The State of Broadband, 2012 .  The deployment cost for WiMAX per megabit is less than other cellular  technologies. This is a key to dense urban, suburban, rural, and remote  area deployments. The technology also enables higher network capacity  to  support  new  value-added  mobile  advertising  services  for  increased  operator revenues.  Because of these broadband revolutions, emerging economies like  India are going wireless—with a higher speed and wider range. This is  fueling the convergence and is transforming the advertising and com- munication industry. Wireless communication technologies like Wi-Fi,  WiMAX, 3G, 4G, and ultra-wideband are working well for all kind of  platforms  such  as  PC,  laptops,  mobile,  and  tablets.  These  technolo- gies  are  well  optimized  for  various  mobile  advertising  applications,  thus taking the advertising solutions and services to the last mile. All  these  new  wireless  communication  technologies  are  providing  vari- ous connectivity solutions to the people of both urban and rural India,  thus allowing them to access advertising and promotional campaigns  whenever  and  wherever  they  want   Online  Advertising  Performance  Outlook, 2012 .        258  Mobile Electronic Commerce  13.7  Conclusion The  mobile  advertising  phenomenon  is  here  to  stay  and  for  good.  The   growing importance of wireless communication technologies in a devel- oping  country  like  India  cannot  be  overstated.  With  nearly  900  million  mobile  subscribers,  an  Internet  user  base  of  approximately  144  million,  and  about  23  million  mobile  Internet  users,  mobile  phones  are  slated  to  become  the  biggest  personal,  group  as  well  as  mass  communication  medium in a not very distant future. Portability and accessibility coupled  with reducing hardware costs, cheaper data, and voice access plans have  provided mobile phones an edge over other communication media. Easy  accessibility and affordability have enabled the mobile phones to penetrate  even the farthest corners of India rendering it a near ubiquitous medium.  This makes them the medium of choice for the advertisers who want to  reach not only to the urban audiences but rural audiences as well. With  the ever-increasing pace of life, most of the working Indian populace does  not get sufficient spare time to be able to access traditional media such as  television and radio. Mobile phones, however, have become almost indis- pensable for this portion of the populace and these are the people who  have the power to purchase. Therefore, mobile becomes the best medium  for the advertisers to reach to such audiences.  Mobile phones in the last decade have evolved from being just a com- munication  device  to  an  advanced  tool  used  for  multifarious  purposes  such as accessing the Internet, making monetary e-transactions, reading  newspapers, social networking, and so on. Technological advancements  in the field of mobile and computing hardware have led to the evolution  of high-end smartphones that are as capable as personal computers and  much  more  convenient  to  use.  Also,  these  technological  advancements  coupled with increasing competition among the mobile hardware man- ufacturing companies have ensured that now smartphones and feature  phones  are  now  available  at  extremely  low  costs  making  them  accept- able in a highly price-sensitive market like India. Another important fac- tor that is acting as a positive catalyst in the growth of mobile phones in  India is the availability of low-cost data and voice access plans. Cheaper  data plans supported by inexpensive smartphones and Internet ready fea- ture phones have acted as a positive catalyst in rise in the phenomenon of  mobile phones. The number of Internet users in India is increasing day by  day, and an interesting fact associated with Indian Internet users is that  most of them have experienced Internet first through mobile devices than  through personal computers or laptops.  The  aforementioned  features  make  mobile  devices  an  appropri- ate  platform  for  advertisers.  Mobile  advertising  is  a  phenomenon  that  is bound to give a hard time to other advertising media such as televi- sion, radio, newspapers, and so on. Mobile advertising in simplest terms         Chapter thirteen:  Mobile advertising  259  is  any  advertisement  that  is  delivered  to  audiences  through  wireless  mobile devices such as mobile phones, feature phones, smartphones, or  any other such device. Mobile advertising offers a plethora of advantages  over  traditional advertising such as personalization, universality, better   audience  tracking  mechanisms,  improved  feedback  mechanisms,  audi- ence  segmentation  based  on  factors  such  as  geographical  location,  data  usage, online purchase preferences, and so on, and a relatively nonintru- sive  way  to  reach  to  the  desired  target  audiences.  These  advantages  of  mobile advertising translate into minimization of the proverbial advertis- ers waste, that is, the expenditure on advertising that goes down the drain  as the messages do not reach to the desired target audiences. Also, mobile  advertising is cheaper in comparison to traditional advertising and pro- vides  much  better  tractability  of  the  advertising  messages  delivered  through it. Despite these tangible advantages, mobile advertising is still at  its nascent stage and will have to deal with a number of issues in order to  be able to realize its true potential in the Indian market.  One of the major issues involved in mobile advertising is of privacy.  Mobile  devices  owing  to  their  very  nature  are  personal.  Any  advertis- ing  message  or  mechanism  that  breaches  the  privacy  of  the  users  may  get negative response from the audiences. Issues like geographical loca- tion  tracking  are  quite  complex  and  need  to  be  handled  sensitively  by  the advertisers. It would be expedient from the advertisers’ perspective  to take prior consent from the users before delivering them advertising  messages   Hyunsock,  2012 .  They  will  have  to  develop  mechanisms  to  make  mobile  advertising  less  intrusive  and  more  rewarding  phenom- enon.  Another  issue  that  the  advertisers  will  have  to  deal  with  is  the  development of innovative advertising ideas in a restrictive environment   small screen size, huge variations in screen sizes, different connectivity  speeds, etc.  of mobile devices. They will also have to deal with connectiv- ity issues as lower connectivity speed would mean that they will not be  able to deliver rich media messages and would have to contend with less  appealing text-based advertising messages. These are the issues that need  to be resolved as soon as possible in order to give a boost to the mobile  advertising industry in India.  There appears to be a very exciting future for the mobile advertisers  in India. The opportunities in front of the mobile advertisers are endless,  and there are a few threats as well. Resolution of threats such as issues  related to privacy, ethical issues such as geographical location tracking,  lower  connectivity  speeds,  and  so  on  would  lead  to  proper  utilization  of  unique  opportunities  such  as  better  audience  segmentation,  quicker  feedback, and access to the most distant markets within India. A proper  understanding and handling of the aforementioned issues would ensure  that mobile advertising finds its roots in India and move ahead nimbly to  reach its true destination.        260  Mobile Electronic Commerce  References Ahonen, T.  2008 .

Electronic customer relationship  management   e-CRM   and  mobile  customer  relationship  management   m-CRM  refer to CRM using the Internet and wireless technology plus  a database, OLAP, data warehouse, data mining, etc. In order to gain an  understanding of the efficiency of implementing an e-CRM and m-CRM  system within the business context, there is a need to develop theoreti- cally and empirically an evaluation process for the e-CRM and m-CRM  system and survey its impact on service quality.  e-CRM can boost customers’ satisfaction and patronage in the tour- ism and travel industry, as Internet business models have empowered cus- tomers with a great amount of information, which, in turn, makes them  more price-sensitive, less brand loyal, and more sophisticated. e-CRM is  one of the primary strategic initiatives in the industry today with coexist- ing criticism and overenthusiasm. There are a rapidly increasing number  of reports on e-CRM implementation failure and success; these reports,  however, are all in piecemeal form.  In recession, being able to create accountable marketing campaigns is  crucial for commercial survival—and personal advancement. e-CRM has  become a critical element of any marketing strategy, providing the means  to generate millions in new revenues. e-CRM strategy is about develop- ing  customer  relationships  through  meaningful  communication  that  is  targeted  and  relevant,  ultimately  building  business  and  improving  the  bottom line. Both the existing academic literature and practical applica- tions of CRM strategies do not provide a clear indication of specifically  what  constitutes  e-CRM  implementation.  This  research  will  argue  that         Chapter fourteen:  e-CRM, m-CRM, and ICTs adoption  267  the  reformulation  of  e-CRM  problems  within  this  new  framework  can  result in more powerful analytical approaches.  Evolving from a simple face-to-face handshake, e-CRM has become a  science, often requiring large expenditures in manpower and technology. In  a people-oriented service industry, e-CRM has become a necessity for any  travel and hotel company. More often than not, the results of e-CRM pro- gram implementations have been disappointing, according to a published  study  by  IBM  Business  Consulting  Services,  called  “Doing  e-CRM  right:  What it takes to be successful with CRM.” The study finds that just 15% of  the companies it surveyed—both small and large—felt fully successful with  their CRM programs. Only 15%! In reality, e-CRM means different things to  different people especially in the travel and travel verticals. From a working  definition, CRM and its online application, e-CRM is a business strategy  aiming to engage the customer in a mutually beneficial relationship. Within  this context here is the best description that describes e-CRM that is univer- sal for any travel supplier or intermediary: e-CRM in the context of Internet  distribution and marketing in the travel and travel verticals is a business  strategy supported by web technologies, allowing travel services suppliers  to engage customers in strong, personalized, and mutually beneficial inter- active relationships, increase conversions, and sell more efficiently.  With the rapid development of information and Internet technology,  the industries of tourism, hotel, and entertainment are constantly introduc- ing the content of experience economy  Cooper, 2003 . The content of travel  channel of Travelocity, Expedia, Yahoo Online, and other websites becomes  much richer. A vast virtual travel market based on e-commerce and online  travel purchase is promoting the industries of tourism and travel in the  United States with an increase of economic scale from 180 billion US dol- lars in 2002 to 64 billion US dollars in 2007  Law and Cheung, 2005 .  e-CRM and m-CRM can be defined as the translation of existing tech- niques for finding customers in the electronic environment. It provides  products and services customized to the needs of the customers. It helps  to retain customer’s loyalty and attend the needs for information and sup- port in the use of the tourism products. Many e-CRM and m-CRM tech- niques are already employed by businesses using nonelectronic methods.  Intelligent agent technologies, the linking of call centers to websites, and  the use of data warehousing techniques to perform detailed analysis of  customer needs are among the new opportunities offered by the Internet  and other advanced ICTs. e-CRM and m-CRM are not just customer ser- vice,  self-service  web  applications,  sales  force  automation  tools,  or  the  analysis of customers’ purchasing behaviors on the Internet and wireless  world. e-CRM and m-CRM are all of these initiatives working together to  enable an organization to more effectively respond to its customers’ needs  and to market to them on a one-to-one basis.        268  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Tourism  can  be  viewed  as  very  different  from  most  other  sectors  of e-commerce and m-commerce as the consumer goes and collects the  product at the point of production, which is the destination. Consequently,  the tourism avoids the need to deliver products around the world. The   factors described earlier result in the taking of a larger and larger share of  e-commerce and m-commerce globally. As a result, the Internet and wire- less technology can be considered as the last revolution in the distribu- tion of tourism information and sales. Internet and m-commerce is even  becoming the primary channel for business-to-business communication.  It offers the suppliers the potential to by-pass intermediaries in the value  chain and thus increases their revenue base.  The travel and tourism sector is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the  world. In order to become more efficient and effective in delivering products  and services to customers via the use of ICT, travel and tourism organiza- tions have to rethink the ways in which they build relationships with their  customers by initiating e-CRM and m-CRM projects. Inappropriate e-CRM  and m-CRM decision making and implementation can result in multimillion  dollar losses, which can translate into a loss of competitiveness. Therefore, the  study conducts to  1  identify critical success factors  CSFs  involved in e-CRM  and m-CRM initiatives in general and  2  identify and examine key issues in  the implementation of e-CRM and m-CRM in the travel and tourism sector.  e-Tourism and m-tourism offer the potential to make information and  booking facilities available to large numbers of consumers at a relatively  lower cost. It enables the tourism sector to make large-scale savings on the  production and distribution of print and other traditional activities such  as call centers and information centers. It also provides a tool for commu- nication and relationship development with the end-consumers as well as  tourism suppliers and market intermediaries.  14.1.2  Objectives of the study This chapter deals with the issues related to the e-CRM, m-CRM, and  ICTs adoption in the e-tourism and m-tourism industry. This study aims  to systematically explore the current status of e-CRM and m-CRM imple- mentation status in the tourism and travel industry and the CSFs that  affect the e-CRM and m-CRM survivability, that is, continued use of an  e-CRM and m-CRM system reaching intended profitability or growth.  Hence, this study is to investigate the tourism and travel industry orga- nizations with regard to the implementation of e-CRM and m-CRM. The  study will seek to bridge the gap between the theories, e-CRM, m-CRM,  and its application within the tourism and travel industry. In order to  achieve  that  goal,  the  study  will  examine  the  benefits  of  e-CRM  and  m-CRM, its potential and the barriers identified, find out CSFs of e-CRM  and m-CRM strategies, and construct an integrated e-CRM and m-CRM         Chapter fourteen:  e-CRM, m-CRM, and ICTs adoption  269  model through literature review and relative theories. Finally, the study  will examine the model via some case studies.  14.2  Literature review 14.2.1  Adoption of e-CRM solutions e-CRM  Electronic Customer Relationship Management  can be defined as  the translation of existing techniques for finding customers in the electronic  environment. It provides products and services customized to the needs of  the customers. It helps to retain customers’ loyalty and attend the needs for  information and support in the use of the tourism products  Lidija, 2008 .  Many e-CRM techniques are already employed by businesses using non- electronic methods. Intelligent agent technologies, the linking of call cen- ters to websites, and the use of data warehousing techniques to perform  a  detailed  analysis  of  customer  needs  are  among  the  new  opportunities  offered by the Internet and other advanced ICTs  Constantelou, 2002 .  According to Constantelou, the most important barriers to the adoption  of e-CRM solutions are the maturity of the market, the financial resources  required, and the prevailing structures and modes of practices within orga- nizations. Considering that the tourism industry operates with low mar- gins,  the  important  financial  investments  in  the  introduction  of  e-CRM  solutions is a barrier to the adoption of these systems. For some companies,  the investments must be justified to shareholders and thus compensated  in a reasonable period of time. Tourism organizations’ culture and orga- nizational structure are other barriers to the adoption of e-CRM solutions.  The organizations are not always ready to adopt these solutions as some  departments show a resistance to change and slowdown the adoption. That  is the reason why a common vision must be developed in order to eliminate  conflicts between new and traditional sale methods  Lidija, 2008 .  The complexity of travel products and the periodic changes in con- sumer tastes and behaviors are considered as additional barriers to the  adoption of e-business methods in CRM. As a matter of fact, some desti- nations become fashionable for a certain period of time while travelers’  tastes and demands evolve over time. Consequently, the industrialization  of  tourism  products  is  a  difficult  task  to  handle   Lidija,  2008 .  KPMG’s  survey  shows  that  CRM  adoption  within  the  travel  sector  is  primarily  driven  by  three  key  factors:   1   The  industry’s  developing  understand- ing  of  the  business  benefits  that  can  be  derived  from  CRM.   2   Travel  companies’ increasing inability to compete in terms of price, as the profit  margins within the industry are already low. A company’s key differenti- ators, or unique selling points, will then stem from customer rather than  price-focused strategies in the near to mid-term.  3  The prioritization of  customer’s retention within travel company’s agendas  KPMG, 2001 .        270  Mobile Electronic Commerce  14.2.2  Step-by-step implementation of e-business methods Considering  all  the  barriers  described  earlier,  many  tourism  orga- nizations  remain  cautious  in  the  implementation  of  the  e-business  methods. That step-by-step approach aims to take into account the com- pany’s  identity  and  image  with  customers   Constantelou,  2002 .  Even  if   e-business  implies  cost  savings  and  the  deepening  of  relationships  with  regular  customers,  some  companies  consider  that  their  adoption  of  e-CRM   solutions  must  follow  the  market  and  the  industry  circum- stances that are highly impacted by unforeseeable events  i.e., terrorist  attacks,  tsunamis, SARS .  Nevertheless, the vast majority of the tourism organizations are will- ing to extend e-business in their organization. They believe that as cus- tomers will get more used and confident in the Internet, they will extend  the  implementation  of  their  e-business  solutions.  Some  companies  con- sider that the expansion of e-business is the strategic choice, which would  help them becoming the leading players in the online market. Obviously,  the increasing maturity of the market and the sufficient number of experi- enced e-customers are necessary to make the Internet channel a meaning- ful investment for all the industry players  Lidija, 2008 .  That is the very reason why CRM strategies are considered as  peripheral  activities  to  the  companies,  which  are  operating  in  the  less  mature  and  small markets. Investment in e-CRM solutions is not their top priority as  they do not expect a large number of users and thus a very scary return on  investment. In spite of the fact that consumers are interested in surfing the  Internet, the vast majority of e-customers still prefer the personalized ser- vice provided by travel agents. As they are overloaded with information,  the  customers  mainly  rely  upon  human  interaction  with  travel  agents.  If we consider business customers, it seems that human interaction is not  going to be replaced by online services as their travel arrangements are  complex and often requires the human touch of an experienced travel agent   Constantelou, 2002 . However, a new web-savvy customer emerges. This  web-savvy customer uses the web as a rich information medium. He seeks  travel information, compares prices, and then proceeds to purchase com- plex travel products online. That is the reason why the leading players,  including airlines and tour operators, have increasingly started to offer a  variety of customer services online and they are particularly successful in  attracting this web savvy customer group indeed  Lidija, 2008 .  We can assess that e-business technologies have facilitated the shift in  the focus of companies from supply to demand while customer retention  and  satisfaction  are  shown  to  have  improved  as  a  result  of  companies’  online presence. In order to realize productivity gains, tourism organiza- tions have to increase the efficiency level of their back office operations.  As a matter of fact, the value of CRM initiatives depends on back office         Chapter fourteen:  e-CRM, m-CRM, and ICTs adoption  271  processes  and  the  flow  of  information  containing  important  customer  data between the front and back offices of a company. This strategy is let  as it allows the companies to focus on the key customer groups that can  generate additional profits. For the tourism industry, the e-business meth- ods help to transpose the existing techniques onto cheaper distribution  channels and thus developing sales potential. However, the e-CRM solu- tions and ITCs must bring benefits to a supply-driven market, meaning  that it must manage the growth and the maintaining of a stable employee  numbers, automate back office and fulfillment operations, and standard- ize products and operations  Lidija, 2008 .  Proponents  of  e-CRM  will  recognize  that  a  comprehensive  under- standing of customers’ activities, personalization, relevance, permits, and  timeliness metric are means for the end of optimization  Milovic, 2011 .  In  the  context  of  Internet  distribution  and  marketing  in  the  hospitality  industry,  e-CRM  is  a  business  strategy  supported  by  web  technologies  that allows hotels to engage guests in strong, personalized, and mutually  beneficial  interactive  relationships,  thereby  increasing  profitability  and  sales effectiveness. e-CRM is the latest technique that companies use to  increase and improve their marketing skills and capabilities. Integrating  technological and marketing elements, e-CRM covers all aspects of online  user experience throughout the transaction cycle: prepurchase, purchase,  and postpurchase  Alhaiou et al., 2009 .  ICT trends in the hotel industry are improving on a daily basis. The  development  of  information  communication  technology  has  dramati- cally changed the way customers interact and seek information, as well  as the way of purchasing services  Ip et al., 2010 . This represents a video  that  shows  the  hotel  through  the  lobby,  hallways,  and  rooms.  ICT  pro- vides a platform for hoteliers to collect information on guests. Many hotel  websites  invite  customers  to  register  and  identify  their  interests,  from  which hotel managers can create personalized services and products and  increase  customer  satisfaction   Ip  et  al.,  2010 .  Personalization  increases  customers’ emotional involvement with the experience, often improving  their opinions about it as well as the service provider. As it is important to  inform the guests, the responsibility of hoteliers is also to keep informa- tion about the guests safe  Luck and Lancaster, 2003 .  14.2.3  e-CRM models e-CRM implies an additional means of communication and level of inter- action with the customer where there is a real difference in the technology  and  its  architecture,  which  allows  for  ease  and  self-service  to  custom- ers. The study summarized the e-CRM models from various scholars as  Table 14.1.        272  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Scholars   Rowley  2002   Anton and Postmus   1999 ; Feinberg  and Kadam  2002  Feinberg and  Kadam  2002   Sigala  2005a   Kotorov  2002 ;  Singh  2002   Riel et al.  2001   Table 14.1  e-CRM Models  e-CRM models   Identified the following functions of e-CRM practices, but  these practices are also very broad and do not focus on  particular organizational processes or customer values:  e-commerce, channel automation software, collaborative  commerce software, online storefront, multichannel  customer management, e-service, e-mail response  management, guided selling and buying, product  configuration, order management, electronic agents,  catalogue management, content management,  e-customer, fulfillment software, self-service. Developed a more customer-centric e-CRM model by  identifying a long list of e-CRM features providing  customer value. Recognized that their 42 e-CRM items may not really  define e-CRM, as e-CRM is a dynamically changing  process. Apart from being criticized for its inclusiveness,  their list of e-CRM features also lacks a systematic  approach for further developing e-CRM features that add  customer value. Developed a more holistic and business operations’  integrated model of CRM implementation, but its value  for this study is limited as it focuses on a strategic rather  than on an operational level. e-CRM is also defined as the application of ICT to increase  the scale and scope of customer service. Building and  maintaining customer relationships online depends on  maintaining effective customer service. Thus, an e-CRM  customer-centric implementation and model should be  viewed in close connection with e-service provision. e-service as “an interactive, content-centered and Internet  based customer service, driven by the customer and  integrated with related organizational customer support  processes and technologies with the goal of  strengthening the customer-service provider  relationship.” Indeed, unless service is maintained,  customer loss may result in great inefficiencies and costs.  Moreover, relationships in e-commerce heavily depend  on information exchange during all functions of the  online purchase process. In turn, there are numerous  opportunities to gather the information in each function  and use it to improve the possibility of continuing  profitable customer relationships by improving service,  save customer’s time and easy frustration.

Their study used e-service categorization for modeling  e-CRM practices for the following reasons:  1  website  design and functionality developed in line with these  categories are proved to significantly affect online  consumer behavior and patronage,  2  it is a systematic  customer value-oriented approach focusing on  supporting consumers’ use of webstores,  3  by using this  framework, one can easily identify and further develop  additional e-CRM features that can add customer value,   4  failure to develop e-CRM features in one or more  steps may defeat the customer provider relationship, and   5  the categorization allows to relate e-CRM features  with organizational functions and processes, which in  turn enables managers to better allocate resources and  develop more appropriate metrics for monitoring and  measuring successes and failures. Their study illustrates how the consumer purchase  behavior stages were used for modeling and measuring  e-CRM practices by classifying and further extending  e-CRM features.  14.2.4    Strengthening customer service  of e-CRM in travel and hotel  The  Internet  is  the  best  interactive  marketing  channel  ever  invented.  Therefore, it is the ideal medium for reaching out to your customers and  establishing interactive relationships with them. It is important to under- stand that customer service is only one aspect of e-CRM and is primar- ily  a  reactive  function  aiming  to  improve  performance  and  efficiency,  while e-CRM as a whole is a proactive long-term strategy. On the other  hand,  e-CRM  is  more  than  just  a  tool  to  achieve  and  enhance  customer  satisfaction. The traditional CRM focus in travel and tourism has always  been customer satisfaction. The presumption is very simple: Customers will  appreciate good service so much they would not go to your competitor. In  other words: customer satisfaction + quality of services = customer loyalty. The truth is that customer satisfaction does not always equal customer  loyalty:  40%  of  satisfied  customers  switch  suppliers  without  hesitation         274  Mobile Electronic Commerce   Forum Corp , 65%–85% of customers who choose a new supplier claim to  be satisfied and very satisfied with the former supplier  Harvard Business  Review , 85% of customers claim to be satisfied, yet willing to switch to  other suppliers  University of Texas .  A study by Cornell University also calls into question the widely held  belief  that  guest  satisfaction  means  repeat  business.  The  results  of  this  study challenged the theory that satisfied guests generate repeat business  in the lodging industry. Analysis showed only a weak connection between  satisfaction and loyalty, which is a precursor to repeat business. In travel the  Internet has provided hoteliers with unprecedented capabilities to interact  with their customers: eNewsletters, online promotions, and sweepstakes,  reservation  confirmation  emails,  prearrival  emails  with  value  adds  and  up-wells, poststay “Thank you” emails, and comment cards.  Interactive Web 2.0 applications on the hotel website  experience and  photo  sharing,  customer  generated  Top  10  lists  of  coolest  bars,  muse- ums, things to do in the destination, etc.  Providing innovative customer  service  on  your  website  and  to  your  customers  via  latest  technological  applications is a must. The airlines have perfected some very neat tools in  this respect. But once again, this is the customer service side of e-CRM.  Establishing mutually beneficial interactive relationships with your cus- tomers is the ultimate goal of any e-CRM initiative.  14.2.5    e-CRM in an integrated e-marketing  strategy for tourism organizations  CRM  has  been  a  buzz  word  in  the  tourism  industry  for  several  years.  However,  looking  at  the  diffusion  among  companies  and  even  more  at  the  commitment  of  the  marketing  and  sales  managers.  According  to  E-Business W@tch, Report  2006 , CRM does not seem to be a big issue  for tourism players. While 36% of the tourism companies in Europe  38%  in the Czech Republic  offer online booking facilities, only 11%  8% in the  Czech Republic  make use of a CRM system. Certainly this might origi- nate in the structure of the tourism industry itself, which is dominated by  small- and medium-sized enterprises. Other reasons may be that the exec- utive management is not fully convinced of the potential of CRM since the  benefits are not always visible immediately. Concerns about the change  caused by the implementation of CRM within an organization might also  be an obstacle to CRM implementation. However, Maurer  2007  indicated,  “e-CRM makes use of the Internet and its services in order to support and  enhance  the  communication  with  customers,  and  both  elicit  and  refine  information about the customers. Knowledge about the markets, the cus- tomer segments, and their demands has become a decisive competitive  advantage  in  the  tourism  industry  with  tougher  and  more  numerous  competitors and an increasing number of products and services on offer.         Chapter fourteen:  e-CRM, m-CRM, and ICTs adoption  275  The shift from customer-oriented to customer-driven business processes,  accompanied by increasing consumer maturity, has led to new challenges  in  the  fulfillment  of  customer  requirements.  Tourists  have  matured  to  prosumers  i.e., professional consumers  who want personalized products  and services for the best rates available.”  The changes mentioned call for an interactive and integrated market- ing strategy in which the Internet acts as an intermediary network for the  essence  of  one-to-one  marketing   the  use  of  information  from  the  con- sumers rather than about the consumers  and the distribution of tourism  products. Therefore, successful eMarketing requires the integration of all  business units and business processes. The development and implementa- tion of a sustainable eMarketing strategy are based on information about  the target groups, competitors, and the market situation  Maurer, 2007 .   Integrated e-marketing strategy development  14.2.6  According to Maurer  2007 , the eMarketing strategy aims to attract visitors  to the company website, generate revenue  i.e., through online bookings   and increase the image and brand awareness of a supplier. This can be  achieved by the continuous enhancement of the three strategic  processes— customer  analysis,  competitor  analysis,  and  business   processes  effi- ciency—applied  to  the  operational  processes  for  maintaining  a  website  that acts as an electronic market place for both B2C and B2B. Besides an  appealing  design  and  usability,  the  basis  for  a  good  tourism  website  is  interesting  and  relevant  content  geared  to  the  needs  and  wants  of  the  targeted customer segments. Visitors to the website who leave electronic  footprints  i.e., log files and profiles  behind increase the image and brand  awareness of a supplier. Besides an appealing design and usability, the  basis for a good tourism website is interesting and relevant content geared  to the needs and wants of the targeted customer segments. Visitors to the  website leave electronic footprints  i.e., logfiles and profiles  behind that  can be used to refine the content and even to develop new products. These  data can be merged and enriched with customer information from other  contact  points  such  as  log-in  data,  online  surveys,  online  competitions,  brochure order, feedback forms, etc. However, publishing attractive con- tent is only one side of the story.  To be found in the virtual globality and hence the promotion of the  website  and  its  content  have  become  important  issues  in  particular  for  suppliers who cannot profit from a well-established brand. According to  various market researchers  i.e., Forrester, Nielsen Net Ratings , about 80%  of tourism website visitors use a search engine when looking for informa- tion about tourism products and approximately 60% of all searches are  carried out through Google. It is essential for an efficient and effective web- site promotion strategy to analyze which information sources the target         276  Mobile Electronic Commerce  groups use, as well as which keywords they use to search for information.  Moreover, one’s website promotion activities can be enhanced by keep- ing an eye on the marketing activities of the competitors in order to find  out what makes them successful. It might be even beneficial to seek stra- tegic alliances and establish ePartnerships. What is important is that all  endeavors  are  monitored  and  evaluated  thoroughly  in  order  to  receive  essential feedback, which, in turn, can be used to boost the performance. A  successful  and  sustainable  eMarketing  strategy  can  only  be  achieved  by  involving  and  coordinating  all  relevant  business  units  in  order to ensure the bundling of information both from and about the cus- tomers and the competitors and eventually add value to it. The Internet  has  changed  the  business  model  in  tourism  significantly.  e-CRM  can  support tourism suppliers in anticipating tourism trends and consumer  wishes to facilitate customer acquisition and retention, to provide person- alized products and services, to identify demands, and to link up with  partners to meet these demands proactively  Maurer, 2007 .  14.2.7  Usages of the Internet and e-tourism According  to  Leiper   2000 ,  Tribe   1997 ,  and  Tremblay   1999 ,  tourism  does not follow the usual rules of economic theory, or of any other theory;  besides, many authors are used to make reference about the  indiscipline  of tourism. Indeed, tourism gathers all the activities dedicated to the sat- isfaction of the needs of the tourists, and borrows to a multitude of other  activities.  The  tourist  products  are  complex  and  heterogeneous  prod- ucts,  combination  of  elements  separated  in  time  and  space   Caccomo  and Solonandrasana, 2001 , often predefined packages assembling inter- related  products  and  services   transport,  accommodation  services,  lei- sure services… . This notion of packaging, of bundling, is the core of the  activity.  Contrary  to  the  traditional  goods  sectors,  where  resources  are  transformed to be delivered to the customers, the tourists have to go to  the resources: Whatever their intrinsic qualities, the resources acquire an  economic value only with the organization of the traveling of the tourists  and development of the activity  Spizzichino, 1991 . Tourist products and  services are often experience goods, the quality or utility are not known  ex ante by the consumers; a system of advices and critics is thus necessary  to the formalization of choices  Gensollen, 2003 .  14.2.8  m-CRM strategy for customer satisfaction According  to  Newell  and  Newell  Lemon   2001 ,  m-CRM  means  using  the mobile channel for customer relationship marketing or management.  A key to any brand-building effort is gaining knowledge of the relation- ship  that  exists  between  the  customer  and  the  brand.  Customers  have         Chapter fourteen:  e-CRM, m-CRM, and ICTs adoption  277  gained more power to choose how they wish to interact with  companies;   therefore,  new  tools  for  customer  communication  are  demanded.  Customers  want  to  be  treated  individually  and  receive  personalized  value. Marketers need to develop alternative ways of reaching customers  with timely, relevant, and highly personal information of high value, and  they  also  need  to  provide  customers  with  a  means  for  timely  feedback   Newell and Newell Lemon, 2001 .  The mobile phone can be used for this purpose. If m-CRM is to have  an effect on brand loyalty, per se, marketers need to engage in a dialog  with  customers  and  personalize  their  brand  communication  messages.  For  example,  the  Belgian  home  improvement  store,  Brico,  collects  vital  information about customers by inviting “its Discount Club members to  join a continued SMS dialogue”  The Forrester Report, 2001 . Those who  sign in receive questions on home improvement, and by answering the  questions,  they  receive  discount  coupons  or  invitations  to  equipment  demonstrations.  An  eventual  goal  of  m-CRM  is  to  empower  customers  and let them be in charge of the brand communication and interaction   Newell and Newell Lemon, 2001 .  Marketers  should  consider  using  m-CRM  when  a  highly  personal- ized  and  timely  dialog  with  customers  is  desired  and  when  they  want  to differentiate the customer service or product offering with an innova- tive method of interaction. Marketers should be cautious, however, since  a long-lasting dialog with customers is challenging to obtain. It will most  likely engage only those customers who are highly involved in the prod- uct  or  company.  Furthermore,  marketers  should  pay  close  attention  to  consumer privacy issues and to handling consumers’ concerns regarding  how their personal information is used  Phelps et al., 2000 .  In recent years, customers using mobile phones have presented a very  fast growing on value-added services, such as games, ringtones, stocks,  Global Positioning System  GPS , MSN mobile, and information services   Hsu and Lin, 2008 . It shows a chance for enterprises that mobile chan- nel is a new opportunity to deliver more complete services to consumers,  to increase corporate brand image and to supplement company products   Sideco, 2011 . There are little researches in the literature about m-CRM  but  few  articles  have  been  deeply  discussing  customer  satisfaction  in  m-CRM   Facchetti  et  al.,  2005;  Hsu  and  Lin,  2008 .  Through  the  mobile  medium access to manage customer relationship, it brings not only new  transactional possibilities but also new challenges. To operate a success- ful m-CRM, a stable technological infrastructure is necessary. Therefore,  m-CRM is integrated to the existing customers and CRM activities so it  is  supported  by  the  technological  infrastructure  of  the  mobile  medium  system  Hsu and Lin, 2008 .  A structured method by which mobile business can be introduced to  the CRM field with more and more mobile phone users. So that m-CRM         278  Mobile Electronic Commerce  has  been  concentrated  seriously   Schierholz  et  al.,  2006;  Hsu  and  Lin,  2008 . The m-CRM integrates wireless technologies into existing opera- tions and strategies on customers. Consequently, m-CRM is a corporate  strategy and systematic approach realized by a mobile device  such as a  mobile phone or PDA . Through mobile value addition, the perception of  customer satisfaction is promoted on strengthening a long-term customer  relationship  Hsu and Lin, 2008 .  While the concept of customer satisfaction is deeply inset with tech- nology  as  is  the  case  with  m-CRM,  customer  satisfaction  helps  enter- prises in creating new customer relationships, acquiring or maintaining  retained  customers  by  the  mobile  medium,  and  enterprises  delivering  their information to customers by wireless networks. Moreover, m-CRM  also  supports  enterprises  on  marketing  strategies  through  understand- ing  customers’  needs  and  improves  the  service  process  through  the  feedback  from  satisfied  customers   Hsu  and  Lin,  2008 .  The  m-CRM  is  not only the critical role of communication in establishing but also aims  at  maintaining  profitable  and  satisfied  customer  relationships  through  mobile communication medium. Therefore, mobile communication sits at  a very important position to increase the degree of customer satisfaction  in m-CRM  Hsu and Lin, 2008 . The m-CRM promotes satisfaction to cus- tomers through the mobile medium on communication, either one-way  or interactive, which is related to sales, marketing, and customer service  activities conducted  Palen et al., 2001; Camponovo et al., 2005 . Therefore,  the mobile medium provides essentially the same function as any other  channel within CRM system. The m-CRM has the most important differ- ence  that  enterprises  and  customers  are  connected  through  the  mobile  medium and customer satisfaction is also promoted to customers through  the  mobile  medium.  Thus,  the  personalized  communication  strength- ens  the  relationship  between  enterprises  and  customers   Hsu  and  Lin,  2008 .  This  also  shows  that  personalization  plays  a  very  important  role  in promoting satisfaction and push up customer relationship. In order to  provide a personalized service through the mobile medium, enterprises  send a relevant communication to targeted customers who always result  in a significantly higher satisfaction than inaccurately targeted customers   Camponovo et al., 2005; Nysveen et al., 2005 .  The  challenge  in  m-CRM  is  to  ensure  that  the  right  messages  are  sent in the right way to the right people who come with a positive per- ception on customer satisfaction. However, message may be missed or  re-sent with the wrong medium at the wrong time by traditional CRM   PocketGear  Mobile  Application  Store,  2011;  Thomas  and  Sullivan,  2005 .  Customers  give  permission  to  receive  messages  by  the  mobile  medium of their preferences and the utilization of the mobile medium  has to overcome these problems. According to the case study, this paper  indicates  that  m-CRM  is  based  on  several  technology-  and  marketing         Chapter fourteen:  e-CRM, m-CRM, and ICTs adoption  279  strategy-related issues to promote their customer satisfaction  Hsu and  Lin, 2008 . With the rising consumer consciousness, customers have more  and more choices that channel the use for communicating with compa- nies. The channel is the new and big opportunity for enterprises to cre- ate business and retain customers. Hence, enterprises approach m-CRM  to increase customer satisfaction by utilizing the mobile medium effec- tively  Hsu and Lin, 2008 .  14.2.9  Mobile challenges for travel and tourism Scholars and industry representatives are turning their attention toward  the promise of electronic wireless media, envisaging that the next—or the  real phase of e-commerce growth will be in the area of mobile commerce   Hampe et al., 2000 . Keen and Macintosh  2001  stress that the issue is that  mobile commerce  m-commerce is marking the start of another era of inno- vation in business and that m-commerce will continue to extend the way  organizations conduct business—and change the relationships between  companies,  customers,  suppliers,  and  partners   Keen  and  Mackintosh,  2001 . Mobility means freedom—say Keen and Macintosh—and freedom  creates  choice and value,  something much more  than convenience  as it  may revolutionize the way companies work, buy, sell, and collaborate.  Although  the  mobile  Internet  appears  to  have  much  to  offer  as  an  instrument  of  commerce,  little  is  known  about  the  consumers’  willing- ness  to  adopt  wireless  electronic  media,  and  the  factors  that  influence  their adoption decisions and value perceptions relating to m-commerce   Pedersen et al., 2002 . Just as we are gradually starting to gain an under- standing of the unique characteristics of the fixed Internet, a new medium  has emerged, the wireless Internet, which raises many of the same ques- tions in a new context  Guerley, 2000 . Building successful strategies for  the mobile marketplace begins, no doubt, by recognizing the distinctive  forces driving the emergence of m-commerce  Senn, 2000 . On the Internet,  firms can create value for customers in a manner that is different from that  which has been achieved in conventional business  Han and Han, 2001 .  Correspondingly,  m-commerce  possesses  unique  characteristics—Keen  and  Macintosh   2001   call  them  the  mobilization  of  knowledge—when  compared  with  traditional   i.e.,  fixed   e-commerce,  and  many  state- ments on an impending m-revolution have, in fact, been triggered by the  assumption that the potential of m-commerce will involve  1  lower bar- riers and  2  greater benefits in comparison to both fixed e-commerce and  traditional commerce. In view of that, the key question from commerce is  to find some way to assess the value of mobile applications to prospective  users  Carlsson and Walden, 2002 , and to gain an understanding of the  factors that may delay the penetration of the mobile Internet on a larger  scale  Lee et al., 2001 .        280  Mobile Electronic Commerce  There  are  a  number  of  ideas  of  what  is  going  to  constitute  the  key  success factors for the actors in the global m-commerce arena. This arena  is already growing diversified with a number of application areas, which  are growing in different directions and at different paces. Travel and tour- ism, being one of the largest and most rapidly expanding industries in the  world and one of the significant users of ICT in its operations will with- out doubt be one of the trailblazers in the global m-commerce arena with  value-added  mobile  applications.  It  can  be  assumed  that  travelers’  and  tourists’ lives will be enhanced by smart services, accessible via mobile  devices  anywhere  and  anytime.  Intelligent  software  technologies  will  allow mobile services to be personalized and context-aware to improve  travelers’  and  tourists’  experiences.  Context-aware  mobile  services  will  make a difference as the services and contents adapt to both the environ- ment and to personal interests.  Thus, it is not too unrealistic to assume that the competitiveness of  tourism organizations and destinations will increasingly depend on their  ability to use innovative mobile technologies to promote location-aware  services  and  to  serve  customers  on  the  move.  The  key  questions  to  be  addressed in the panel are:              1. Which  are  the  key  value-adding  mobile  services   each  panelist  is   expected to propose and motivate one service ?  2. What do we know about consumers’ willingness to adopt m-services   each speaker will identify one to two factors that will influence the  adoption process of the proposed m-service ?  3. How  will  these  services  make  the  day  for  the  m-traveler  and   4. How is the mobile technology going to change the travel and tour-  m-tourist?  ism industry?  14.2.10  Mobile industry and the travel and tourism industry Modern  technology  is  constantly  changing  the  way  of  communication  and interaction in different areas of human life. Miniaturization of elec- tronic  components  and  enhancements  in  transfer  speeds  of  wireless  transmissions has pushed the use of mobile devices to almost every area  of human life  Kumar and Zahn, 2003 . Web technologies based on user  interaction in social networks, known as Web 2.0 are created around the  idea  that  the  people  who  consume  media  should  not  passively  absorb  what  is  available,  and  rather  they  should  be  active  contributors  and  codevelopers  O’Reilly, 2011 . Using a new generation of mobile devices,  it is possible to consume and change content available on the web from  different  locations  and  devices.  Hardware  components  are  becom- ing  more  powerful,  but  less  power  demanding  and  in  a  few  years  the         Chapter fourteen:  e-CRM, m-CRM, and ICTs adoption  281  mobile devices could have the prime usage for everyday applications like   reading, web browsing, multimedia, and general information manipula- tion  Palen et al., 2001 .  By  popularizing  technologies  like  social  interaction  and  location  awareness, a relatively new era in the modern business is becoming more  and more evident. Those areas are based around using customer’s loca- tion with all other information that could be gathered, for analysis and  service providing  Abowd, 1997; Maervoet et al., 2008; Chiu et al., 2009 .  These tactics are already being used by big advertisement companies like  Google  2010 , which provide location-based advertisements to customers,  targeting  their  location  and  interests   Camponovo  et  al.,  2005 .With  the  radical impact of the mobile networks and mobile devices, this kind of  service providing will be even more evident in the future. The emerging  technology can be used in all kinds of different areas like finance, market- ing, sales, transit, and tourism. The focus of this paper will be on the last  two areas—transit and tourism, because the potential use of the technol- ogy is huge and promises opening of the new possibilities in the sector  that is currently spiraling down in the profit and market share.  Recent studies have shown that, while the economy is in the state of  recession, potential customers rather spend their earnings on home enter- tainment  systems  and  other  electronic  devices  like  laptops  and  mobile  phones, than on vacation planning and traveling  Facchetti et al., 2005 .  This behavior generates huge losses for the industry based on traveling or  tourism in general. The potential solution for the problem is connecting  the mobile industry with the travel and tourism industry in a way that  will animate the customers to travel more and enjoy their time by using  interactive or helpful content. That could be of benefit for both sides—the  customer and the industry.  14.2.11    Use of mobile technology services  in the travel and tourism industry  14.2.11.1  Finding the customers  In the first place, the technology must animate the customer to think about  traveling  Buhalis and Law, 2008 . Nowadays it is not enough to motivate  potential customers solely with pictures, souvenirs, tales of natural and  cultural  beauties,  and  delicious  culinary  recipes.  One  of  the  things  the  Internet has brought is the outstanding multimedia and user interaction,  which enables users to experience almost anything from the comfort of  their home. Online activities have advantages compared with traditional  offline activities. For many consumers, online shopping represents a more  entertaining activity than the same activity done offline. They have a posi- tive  attitude  toward  Internet  advertising,  which  they  perceive  as  being  informative and up-to-date  Dobre and Constantin, 2010 .        282  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Interesting facts, questionnaires, games, and viral advertising are a  good starting point for marketing campaigns. In the last few years, games  and  viral  advertising—specially  designed  commercial  concept  relaying  on fast, exponential information sharing through social networks  hence  the name Viral , have been the most successful tools in animating poten- tial customers into spending their earnings on the advertised products or  services  Helm, 2000; Larsen et al., 2007; Porter and Golan, 2011 .  Usually,  questionnaires  are  more  informative  than  games  or  viral  advertising,  but  they  can  cause  the  customer  to  lose  interest  very  fast,  so this sort of advertising must be well-thought-out, short, compact, and  targeted on specific customers  Kotler and Armstrong, 2010 . This can be  achieved by incorporating surveys within games or between multimedia  contents,  so  the  customers  will  not  be  able  to  ignore  the  content  of  the  survey. The results of these questionnaires should not be considered com- pletely reliable during the analysis and evaluation, although they could  provide  some  input  from  the  potential  customer  and  subsequently  be  used as a measure of motivation for certain product or service.  14.2.11.2  Make them an offer they cannot refuse  The  mobile  devices  are  the  best  gateways  to  the  customer  these  days,  because they are the most popular means of communication  The Nielsen  Company, 2011; Sideco, 2011  and make customers available at all times   Nysveen  et  al.,  2005 .  According  to  Gartner  market  research  in  2009   Stevens  and  Pettey,  2011   and  2011   Pettey  and  Goasduff,  2011 ,  world- wide  smartphones  sales  to  end-users  has  been  continuously  growing.  Smartphone sales to end-users were up 72.1% from 2009 and accounted  for 19% of total mobile communications device sales in 2010.  Different  operating  systems  changed  their  market  position  during  that time, but in total, recorded sales have been growing steadily. The win- ner in the market of smartphones the previous year were mobile phones  based on Android  2011  operating system, which grew 888.8% in 2010 and  moved to the second position in the top list of smartphones sold  Pettey  and Goasduff, 2011 . Many mobile applications and games are free and  accessible to users through web stores and markets. Currently the most  popular mobile application stores are Apple’s App Store  2011 , BlackBerry  App World BlackBerry  App World, 2011 , Google’s Android Market  2011 ,  Microsoft’s Store  2011 , and Pocket Gear  Pocket Gear Mobile Application  Store,  2011 .  They  are  open  to  the  developers,  hence  creating  a  bridge  between customers and content providers, and in this way help spread  the information about a potential product.  Customers can also be motivated by obtaining access to knowledge.  Interesting  literature  provided  in  electronic  compact  form,  specially  designed for mobile devices could raise interest within certain user groups  and spread the information to many potential customers. Connecting with         Chapter fourteen:  e-CRM, m-CRM, and ICTs adoption  283  the  mainstream  media  like  the  Internet  news  portals  and  blogs  can  be  valuable for the success of the advertised product. Investing in applica- tions specifically designed for the social interaction and content sharing is  also essential for the potential success of the product or service, allowing  it to be discussed and rated, which is beneficial for the future marketing  campaigns and product placements  Riegner, 2007 .  Customer age groups and gender must also be considered. Misplaced  or complex applications could have a great impact on a smaller group of  people,  but  fail  to  have  the  desired  effect  on  a  larger  group  of  custom- ers  Tarasewich, 2003 . Applications or games must be relatively simple,  considering that the elderly age group could potentially have problems  with their usage. If the probability of reaching a larger group of elderly  customers is considered important, then games and complex application  should be avoided  Conci et al., 2009 . Violence, inappropriate language,  and other questionable content should also be avoided. Ergonomics of the  mobile application must be considered as important as the content. Small  screens can be very difficult to handle, so the design must be as ergonomic  and clear as possible Bruner and Kumar  2003 ,  Cyr et al., 2006 .  14.2.11.3  Present options to the potential customers  When the interest among customers is awoken, the time is right to start the  second stage of the concept, which is to take all the necessary preparations  to present user with the lucrative options for spending their free time or  vacation. Since the potential customer has already spent some time with  the aforementioned content, it is possible to take action and analyze the  data gathered from the user’s actions. One of the solutions is to create the  necessary backbone system based on business intelligence and data min- ing concepts  Cech and Bures, 2009; Liu et al., 2010 , which will generate  enough information to make a decision on what categories of the service  should be offered to the customer.  If there is not enough data gathered from the potential customer, com- mon data like user’s origin, language, proximate location or patterns of  web usage could be used to narrow the list of possible services that could  be offered. Some of that data could be obtained from large Internet search  engines or other services that offer that kind of information. Customer’s  proximate preferences can also be obtained by analyzing data from other  customers living in the nearby area  Finn et al., 2000 .  The last two options offer a part of reference data for the potential cus- tomer, but are much less effective and lack the individuality, and should  be used only if there is no other way to gather information directly from  the targeted person. Also, these solutions are less cost-efficient because  every  piece  of  information  obtained  from  large  advertisement  agencies  comes at a price that could grow over time and create significant problems  in the budget  Antonio et al., 2011 .        284  Mobile Electronic Commerce  After the information is processed, it must be delivered and presented  to the potential client in a way that will raise the chances of successful  product reception by the potentially interested receiving side. That could  also  be  achieved  using  games,  multimedia,  or  some  other  interactive  medium like social networks. Customer wants more value for his or her  money, and that must be taken into consideration. Because of the nature  of today’s way of life where almost one billion people own a mobile device  that can connect to the Internet  ITU, 2011 , tighter and more transparent  link between Internet providers, media services, and travel agencies must  be established.  Internet and media providers possess the content that is very attractive  to the customers traveling via travel agencies. First and the most impor- tant part of the chain is the Internet connection that has to be affordable  to the average customer. If there is no such thing as a broadband connec- tion, no other processes can be considered. When traveling abroad, most  users have the choice of using roaming Internet connection, but that can  be extremely expensive and unaffordable for a great majority of potential  users. Other choices include using wide area WI-FI connections like ones  in the big metropolitan cities like Paris, France or Berlin, Germany. Also  a contract between travel agencies and mobile operators could be negoti- ated,  so  passengers  traveling  with  the  agency  could  have  some  benefits  while connecting to mobile operators’ network, without roaming, or with  roaming but with special, lowered prices per data unit  Antonio et al., 2011 .  14.2.11.4  Keep track of customers  If a customer chooses to purchase the presented offer, interaction between  the tour operator central server and customer’s mobile devices could be  used  to  help  or  entertain  the  customer  in  a  number  of  different  ways.  If  the  customer  buys  complete  travel  package  including  airplane  trans- port,  transfer  from  the  destined  airport  to  the  hotel  or  apartment  and  sightseeing  tours,  it  is  possible  to  provide  them  in  real  time  the  latest  weather forecast, information about airplane delays, bus stops, and other  important information. The customer can be led from the moment when  he or she leaves home to the moment of arriving back after a trip or vaca- tion  Antonio et al., 2011 .  In the urban areas, location-based data could be used to expand the  mobile device services. Location-based services make use of a device’s inte- grated GPS components to get the user’s current location. The latitude and  longitude of the customer device is usually determined using some sort  of positioning service like satellite-based GPS—currently, the only GPS in  commercial function  Virrantaus et al., 2001 . In the future, devices could  be using another type of GPS like the Russian GLObal Navigation Satellite  System   GLONASS —ex-military  system,  but  currently  open  to  public   Russian Institute of Space Device Engineering, 2011 , Chinese Compass         Chapter fourteen:  e-CRM, m-CRM, and ICTs adoption  285  navigation system  Gibbons, 2011; Grelier, 2011 , and the European Union’s  Galileo positioning system  Issler et al., 2011 . Some microchip manufac- turers like Broadcom  Broadcom, 2011 , or Qualcomm  2011 , implemented  the  support  for  multiple  position  systems  in  their  chip  architecture  to  achieve more flexibility in global markets, especially in Russia where the  government confirmed a plan to introduce 25% import duty for all GPS  devices without support for GLONASS by 2012, as part of the efforts to  encourage worldwide adoption of that technology  Bachman, 2011 .  Current GPS modules integrated in modern mobile processors pro- vide enough accuracy to be used with the mobile applications interacting  in a way that makes it possible for the customer to be leading in almost  every  situation.  GPS  positioning  is  less  suitable  for  use  in  urban  areas  because of the significant signal loss, which is attributed to signal bounc- ing  of  the  walls  of  tall  buildings  block   multipath  propagation ,  which  can  cause  inaccuracy  in  positioning  results.  Bad  weather  conditions  also contribute to signal degradation. Weak signal contributes to signifi- cant  delays  in  precise  signal  acquisition.  Better  solution  for  calculating  the mobile device’s position is with the help of the network-positioning  approach  Antonio et al., 2011 . This concept, also called Assisted-GPS, or  A-GPS  Jarvinen et al., 2011 , is integrated into most mobile devices today  and uses the help of mobile network tower cells to calculate geographical  position faster and more accurate. Cellular network towers can provide  user’s device with additional helping parameters as          1. Orbital data with current satellite positions 2. Position recalculation from the gathered GPS data snapshot received   from the client  3. Approximate location of the customer using the network multilat- eration, which narrows the GPS position to a smaller geographical  location  If  there  is  no  GPS  signal  to  accurately  determine  users’  position,  most  common solution is based on the network multilateration based on signal  strength received on three or more mobile base stations  Wong and Choi,  2007 . This concept can narrow the radius of the customer’s approximate  position up to 50–70 m, depending on the number of network towers and  terrain architecture.  14.2.11.5  Take care of customers’ needs  If there is a travel delay, the customer could be presented with a choice to  purchase some sort of interactive or multimedia entertainment like mobile  IP TV or video-on-demand. But if the flight is to be canceled or delayed for  an uncertain period of time, the customer should be alerted and presented  with  the  list  of  choices  like  booking  a  hotel apartment  or  contacting         286  Mobile Electronic Commerce  the  taxi  service   Antonio  et  al.,  2011 .  On  some  flights,  the  customer  is  offered with an option to purchase WI-FI Internet connection during the  time of the flight so travel agencies could team up with airline companies  and create special offers that could also be a part of the travel package   Jahn  et  al.,  2003 .  If  the  customer  is  traveling  by  airplane,  transporta- tion from destined airport sometimes is not included in the purchased   package. In that case, customer using the mobile application can contact  the taxi service, or he or she can be informed in detail on how to reach the  destination.  Timetables  for  buses,  trains,  or  metro  transportation  could  also  be  provided,  as  well  as  prices  and  categories  of  tickets.  If  the  cus- tomer has a device with location awareness, such as GPS-enabled device,  detailed instructions could be provided leading them across the points of  interest. The relatively new concept in the development of mobile appli- cations  called  augmented  reality  is  similar  to  fighter  jet  pilots  head-up  display  Antonio et al., 2011 . In this concept, the mobile device camera,  electronic compass, and GPS device are connected together via software  platform  creating  advanced  visual  experience   Feiner  et  al.,  1993 .  On  mobile device screen, the actual image captured with the device’s cam- era, data about current direction and position of the device analyzed via  electronic compass and GPS coordinates are mixed with the information  about the environment and surroundings gathered from the Internet.  All of this is presented on the device’s screen in a compact form allow- ing the customer to have the synthesis of right information about the sur- roundings  in  real  time.  There  are  many  visually  or  hearing-impaired  people who are willing to travel and can be potential customers. Many of  them have difficulty finding their way, frequently feeling disoriented and  even isolated. Despite their impairments, they also are potential custom- ers  for  travel  and  tourism  companies.  There  is  a  number  of  navigation  systems developed for visually impaired people, and some of them can  provide dynamic interaction and adaptability to change in the environ- ment. Outdoor navigation systems are generally based on GPS  Antonio  et al., 2011 . They can locate and track the user and give them up-to-date  information  about  routes  and  rerouting  according  to  changes  in  the  environment. That system should also be able to give information about  nearby signs  Virtanen, 2001; Virtanen and Koskinen, 2004 .  In an indoor environment, such as airport building or museum, orien- tation is more difficult because of the confined space with many obstacles  like stairs, doors, and furniture  Rajamaky et al., 2007 . The next logical step  is to adapt hardware and software of the mobile devices to the level that  is comfortable for people with special needs. For hearing-impaired people,  design should be based around visual interaction, and for those visually  impaired, design must have more audio and tactile stimuli, such as screens  capable of displaying Braille alphabet  Antonio et al., 2011 . The application  should be at customers’ hand at all times during the trip, providing current         Chapter fourteen:  e-CRM, m-CRM, and ICTs adoption  287  information about historical monuments, museums, bars, clubs, and other  attractions  Dìez-Dìaz et al., 2007; Paelke and Sester, 2010 . Customer’s gen- der, age, and budget should be considered when offering points of interest.  This information could be gathered right on spot through the application,  or could be extracted from the data collected from the customer before he or  she decided to book the trip. The first option is a better choice for customer  and travel agency, because it enables more accurate results for places worth  visiting for the customer, and more detailed information about wishes and  patterns of behavior, for the travel agency. These data also allows better  choice to future travelers so they have more options presented even before  they arrive at the destined location  Antonio et al., 2011 .  The application must have an interface with the most popular social  networks like Facebook  2010  or Twitter  2010 , so the user can share the  experience with friends or followers. Users rating should also be imple- mented, and he or she should have the possibility to evaluate rate service,  accommodation,  visited  places,  etc.  That  information  could  be  shared  between  other  users  and  travel  agencies  making  the  service  better  and  more advanced. The trend today, especially with the younger population  is avoiding travel agencies and turning directly to web enabled company  services  for  finding  flights  and  accommodation.  In  that  way  younger  people feel more free and unbound by agency-created itinerary and can  travel with significantly smaller budget than with the common options  presented  by  the  agency   Antonio  et  al.,  2011 .  This  group  of  potential  customers should not be neglected since it is a great target for offering a  mobile application that could help them plan the travel their way. For a  small amount of money, they could purchase an application that would  offer the best way to plan a trip to the wanted location. The quantity of  purchased applications by users could largely surpass the funds spent for  creating it  Antonio et al., 2011 .  14.2.12  Conceptual model of mobile device integration Conceptual model of integrated mobile services consists of three essential  parts  Antonio et al., 2011 :          1. Mobile application 2. Enterprise  architecture  consisting  of  cloud-based  SaaS   Software- As-A-Service , which is the business-oriented part of the application 3. Decision support system for business intelligence and information  gathering.  Information  is  generated  via  multiple  sources,  mainly  related to the Internet  Goal of the presented architecture is to provide synthesized information  from different sources, protocols, and technologies that can be found on         288  Mobile Electronic Commerce  the  global  network.  The  center  of  the  architecture  is  a  user  carrying  a  mobile  device  able  to  connect  to  a  wireless  network.  Using  application  developed  for  that  device,  the  user  can  communicate  with  the  cloud- based architecture owned or leased by a network operator, travel agency,  or some other enterprise industry subject. The user can also be a source of  information providing feedback via mobile application itself or through  blogs, webcasts, reviews, social networks, or other Web 2.0 communica- tion tools. Described system would not be based only on feedback from  one user, but on massive amount of data gathered from the Web  Antonio  et al., 2011 . This data could come from blogs, podcasts, forums, reviews,  frequent  web  searches,  news  portals,  social  networks,  etc.  Because  the  number  of  users  connected  to  the  Internet  grows  linearly  every  year   Internet World Stats, 2011 , today almost two billion people have Internet  access  ITU, 2011 . The amount of data on the web increases by approxi- mated 10% yearly  Wilhelm, 2011  nearing 50 billion unique web pages in  2011, and it is extremely hard to extract useful and precise information  from the Web content. These statistics include only data gathered from the  number of pages existing online, but the Web consists of many informa- tion sources that are constantly changing, or is in a format that could not  be described as a web page, for example, social content and multimedia,  both containing valuable information about the behavior of Internet users   Antonio et al., 2011 .  To  be  able  to  analyze  so  much  data,  nontraditional  approach  must  be  considered.  Analyzing  data  in  detail,  one  at  a  time  would  be   time-consuming,  resource  demanding,  and  virtually  impossible.  The  technology that could provide synthesis of content is based around fuzzy  linguistic  agents,  semantic  clients,  and  neural  networks   Bigus,  1996;  Herrera-Viedma et al., 2005 . The process during which data of interest  are gathered from the Internet is called content acquisition. To be able to  distinguish between small amounts of interesting and large amounts of  potentially uninteresting data, a selection must be applied. Data selection  is enforced with the help of the customer profile database. This database  can  be  created  via  customer’s  interests  gathered  from  aforementioned  questionnaires or with the help of the data gathered from the social net- working sites  Antonio et al., 2011 .  This process leads to knowledge creation from which the set of rela- tively strict rules of content filtering can be created and inserted into the  customer profile database for filtering the content in content acquisition  phase  Srivastava and Cooley, 2003 . Implementation of this technology  would  gather  precise  information  based  on  a  set  of  rules,  and  produce  approximate values in synthetic form, compressing large amounts of data  to only crucial information that could be used by the client or the enter- prise software owned by the service provider  Antonio et al., 2011 .        Chapter fourteen:  e-CRM, m-CRM, and ICTs adoption  289  Synthesized  information  can  be  further  processed  by  the  process  called  data  cleansing  and  preprocessing   Bigus,  1996   in  which  incor- rect data is ignored and correct data is saved to the data warehouse for  further analysis. Data obtained in this step could be connected with the  offerings from advertisers in partnership with service or application pro- vider, so the end-user gets the detailed information with helpful hints  combined with the latest offerings from the business partners. Ranking  of the most interesting results must also be considered to be an important  issue. Although the final results are synthesized, there can still be a sig- nificant amount of information that complies with the rules defined from  the user’s interests. Location could be used to help ranking the results,  with the offers closer to the user’s location positioned on the top of the  presented result. The user can be interactively forced to make the selec- tion between two or more additional options and the result of the cho- sen option s  can be used to narrow the search and display of the results   Antonio et al., 2011 .  For example, if the user wants to book a hotel or private accommo- dation, he or she could be faced with the big set of results, although the  data has already been cleaned and synthesized. To narrow the search to  a smaller set of data, the user can be presented with the set of choices like  accommodation special offers, category and type, relative distance from  the user’s current location, view etc…. Commercial side of the result rank- ing should be considered if significant amount of financial resources is  gathered from the advertising. The paid advertisements could be placed  on the top of the presented results or marked for greater visibility. Google  presented paid ad ranking concept in which the commercial companies  go through bidding and the competing process to reserve the better rank- ing in search results  Antonio et al., 2011 .  The information received by the user can be divided into two types:        1. General helpful information about places, tourist attractions, means  of  transportation,  etc.,  which  is  essential  for  the  user  to  enjoy  the  trip.  2. Special offers, such as current business and service offerings by the  partners and advertisers, making the user’s experience potentially  even more enjoyable.  14.2.13  From m-Tourism to m-Tourism 2.0 What is m-Tourism? m-Tourism stands for mobile tourism. Year after year,  the daily use of mobile phones has constantly evolved. m-Tourism takes  into account all kind of touristic use of mobile phones. Tourism destina- tions, as well tourism organizations or any company linked to the field of         290  Mobile Electronic Commerce  m-Tourism2.0  POI  k + c   i n= c k + c   i n= c  Flickr  Internet  Twitter  Figure 14.1  m-Tourism 2.0.  From Beça, P. and Raposo, R., m-Tourism 2.0: A con- cept where mobile tourism meets participatory culture, Dep. Comunicação e Arte,  University  of  Aveiro,  Portugal  e-Review  of  Tourism  Research   eRTR ,  Aveiro,  Portugal, 2013.   tourism is developing new mobile applications or even mobile websites.  m-Tourism is a very promising branch of tourism, after e-tourism.  A quick scan of recent work done in this field suggests that, within the  m-tourism context, until now the core issues researched are related with  interaction design and its intrinsic concerns such as usability,  accessibility,  and  the  search  for  the  flawless  ubiquitous  system   Kimber  et  al.,  2005;  Bortenschlager et al., 2010; Canadi et al., 2010 . What is suggested in this  paper is that, with the aid of what is known from the Web 2.0 experience,  participatory culture should also become a core research issue thus grant- ing the possibility of exploring what is beyond what is suggested by the  tourism industry.  The  concept  of  m-Tourism  2.0,  illustrated  in  Figure  14.1,  establishes  as one of its cornerstones the need for solutions that allow the tourists to  communicate  their  perspective  of  what  they  are  feeling  and  experienc- ing in any given moment and being able to share that information with  someone who, may or may not, use that information for their own benefit.  In Figure 14.2 the tourists, either with the use of their laptops or mobile  phones, when trying to access multimedia content  text, photos, videos,  audio  about a points of interest  POI , will be presented with K, which  is the content provided by the tourism authority responsible for that POI,  plus C, which is the content provided by the tourists linked to the com- munity and tailored according to the tourists profile preferences. The  i  n  is basically the information provided by the community of users onto the  system,  which  will  be  moderated,  filtered,  and  correlated  before  being  added  to  K  and  shared  with  other  users.  With  these  contributions  it  is  expected that the tourists will be able to have access to additional infor- mation that may help enrich their experience; have access to new infor- mation in case they decide to repeat the experience in the future; provide  their own opinions on matters that may at times seem gray, dull, or too  partial  and  insufficient  from  an  information  point  of  view;  allow  them         Chapter fourteen:  e-CRM, m-CRM, and ICTs adoption  291  Balancing customer needs  for both human and   computer interaction within e-CRM implementations.

It may also allow tourism professionals to learn from the interactions and  content provided and, in some cases, rethink current strategies, projects,  products, and services  Beça and Raposo, 2013 .  14.3    Integrated e-CRM and m-CRM model  in tourism industry  According to the comprehensive literature review mentioned earlier, the  study constructs an integrated e-CRM and m-CRM model in the Tourism  industry as Figure 14.2. e-CRM and m-CRM integrates both external and  internal aspects to fit the customer’s specific needs, the external aspects of         292  Mobile Electronic Commerce  e-service include  1  foundational services,  2  customer-centered services,   3  value-added services, and  4  self-services. e-service is “an  interactive,  content-centered  and  Internet-based  customer  service,  driven  by  the  customer  and  integrated  with  related  organizational  customer  support  processes and technologies with the goal of strengthening the customer- service  provider  relationship   Ruyter  et  al.,  2001 .”  The  internal  aspects  include  modern  information  technology—from  relational  database,  to  data warehousing, to data mining, to computer telephony integration, to  Internet delivery channels—to unlock customer profitability.  e-CRM  integrates  sales,  marketing,  and  service  strategies  that  will  create more value propositions for customers. It enables firms to recreate  an  old-fashioned one-to-one relationship with customers along with mass- market  efficiencies  from  selling  to  millions  of  customers—the  power  of  mass-customization. e-CRM integrate both external and internal aspects  to  building  interactive  relationships  and  virtual  relationships  with  cus- tomers, providing a unique customer value, building customer E-loyalty:  Customer touch applications were critical for repeat purchase intention and  as a driver of loyalty. A practical e-CRM is being able to know the customer,  sending personalized messages, being there at every touch-point  involving  planning, purchasing, service consumption and poststay, and providing a  unique value proposition that leads to increased customer loyalty.  The  main  components  of  an  e-CRM  and  m-CRM  strategy  in  travel   and tourism:  1. Know your customer 2. Customer service 3. Personalization 4. More efficient marketing 5. Build customer loyalty 6. Finding the customers 7. Make them an offer they cannot refuse 8. Present options to the potential customers 9. Keep track of customers                      10. Take care of customers’ needs  14.4  Case studies of e-tourism and m-tourism 14.4.1  Travel agencies It is increasingly geared today to talk about e-tourism as tourism as new  technologies  are  inexorably  bound  to  converge  to  a  completely  digital  tourism.  Therefore,  e-tourism  includes  activities  in  the  tourism  sector,  on  the  Internet.  For  users,  e-tourism  offers  ways  to  prepare,  organize,  and  book  their  travel  via  the  Internet:  identification  of  the  destination,         Chapter fourteen:  e-CRM, m-CRM, and ICTs adoption  293                 purchase  transportation,  development  of  an  itinerary,  accommodation  booking, and information exchange with other surfers. Since its appear- ance in 1998, e-tourism is a way of promoting and booking essentials in  the tourism and travel  industry. Users and consumers of e-tourism are  designated by the world of marketing as touristonautes tourists or online.  The m-tourism is the declination of mobile phones, e-tourism. There are  numerous exhibitions and conferences now dedicated to e-tourism, such  as Encounters eTourism institutional Pau, Travel in multimedia  MEC  in  St Raphael, Tourism Professionals meeting in Sierre  Valais —Switzerland.   SEOzoic.com, 2012 .  The area of e-tourism brings together many tourism stakeholders as   well as new entrants pure play  SEOzoic.com, 2012 :  1. Tourism businesses: travel agency online service hotel, airline, rail-  way, or navigation.   2. Editing  and  publishing:  travel  guide,  magazine,  travel  blogs   the   “infomediaries” websites specializing in travel information .  3. Technologies: Compare prices, aggregator, search engine, and Meta   search specializes in travel.  4. Institutional actors: tourist office, CRT, CDT, minister, observatories.  14.4.2  Using mobile technology for e-tourism    1. The mobile tourist guide system has functions to enter and to orga- nize the tourism objects in the database and to make them available  for  tourists  and  administrators  using  the  e-tourism  management  information  systems   TMIS   portals  in  which  the  tourism  process  and its activities have been structured.  2. The  m-tourism  object  management  systems  are  now  compatible  for all kind of user devices, the conventional desktop PC, as well as  the mobile devices laptop, PDA, and mobile telephone  Samir and  Hosam, 2010 .    Samir and Hosam  2010  indicated m-tourism means the provi- sion of tourism services on wireless devices: portable computers,  PDAs, mobile telephones, and tablet PC. In the m-tourism field,  we notice that the tourism services must answer specific condi- tions.  We  will  have  to  get  around  the  technical  restrictions  so  we can create good tourism services. The usage of video, audio,  clear interfaces, and divided tourism services must contribute to  this. Furthermore, we will have to adapt the content to the needs  of  the  mobile  user.  Because  the  user  has  a  fragmentized  time  schedule,  we  will  have  to  be  sure  that  the  tourism  objects  are  not too long. Dividing the knowledge in smaller modules offers  a solution.                             294  Mobile Electronic Commerce  The advantages, difficulties, and limitations of mobile tourism are as   follows  Samir and Hosam, 2010 :  1. The advantages of mobile tourism refer mostly to the mobile user: a  great flexibility, an improved tourist schedule is possible, increased  productivity during dead moments, and just in time tourism.   2. The difficulties and limitations: Nevertheless, they have very small  screens, limited memory capacity, and the large diversity of mobile  devices obstruct a good tourism experience.  14.4.3    Use of mobile platform technologies  in tourism  m-tourism   observatory.gr  2007  indicated one of the most important technological  developments in tourism and a fundamental paradigm in the provision  of personalized services is in the use of mobile platform technologies in  tourism, both from the user’s point of view and from the supply side:  1. In the promotion and management of alternative tourism and in city  tours, in the form of portable guides. The presence of multimedia and  location-based services in mobile platform applications is noteworthy. 2. Also notable is the particular appeal of portable guides with facili- ties for information storage, organizing, location finding, and com- bining and scheduling visits.  3. Such applications can organize, schedule, and optimize sightseeing  in cities or museums and other places of interest, by suggesting the  best combinations to the user. The probability of a destination being  selected very much depends on the provision of such facilities.   4. Among the most widespread mobile platform applications are those in  the area of alternative tourism, and in particular in ecological tourism,  with sightseeing in natural parks, bicycle tours, mountaineering, etc.  5. The  countries  pioneering   in  m-tourism  applications  are  the  Netherlands, France, Italy, and Finland. The Netherlands is the world- wide  leader  in  mobile  platform  technologies.  An  indicative  exam- ple is the technological solution developed in the framework of the  ABEL research project that constitutes a mobile guide for vacations  in Twente. The guide operates in a PDA device equipped with GPS,  fully customized to the user’s individual profile. Also important was  the participation of the Netherlands in the WebPark project that was  implemented in the Wadden Sea area and the Swiss National Park.  The relevant solution exploits GPS services in smartphones and PDAs  and, among others, responds to user’s queries and provides informa- tion for his or her current location.        Chapter fourteen:  e-CRM, m-CRM, and ICTs adoption  295        6. The  one  delivered  by  the  EU-funded  REGEO  project  in  natural  parks in Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, and Austria. This proj- ect involved the development of an information system combining  an application for the design of web maps, a virtual geo-multimedia  database, mobile devices, and advanced techniques for the creation  of virtual 3D worlds.   7. A case in Italy, in particular the Mountain biker application. This  is  a  mobile  tourist  guide  for  mountain  biking  in  the  southern  Tyrol area. The visitor is given a GPS device to put on his or her  bike.  The  device  assists  the  mountain  bikers  during  their  tours  and  also  provides  facilities  for  room  e-booking,  in  cooperating  hotels.  14.4.4    m-Tourism: The case of the Paris  transportation applications  The applications of Metro Paris Subway are shown as follows*: Augmented  reality:  Your  New  Eye  is  an  augmented  reality  functionality  that enables the traveler to locate the nearest subway station with iPhone’s  camera live view. The application displays elements located at maximum  1 km away from where the person stands. The iPhone user can display  his  phone  in  the  horizontal  position  to  get  a  list  of  all  nearest  stations.  When a station is selected, a red arrow  compass  is displayed to show the  direction and the distance to that point. He can also position his phone  vertically to obtain a 360-degree view of all stations nearby your location,  updated in real time as you walk in the streets.  Flashcodes:  The  RATP   the  Paris  transportation  company   has  been  dis- playing more than 20,000 flash codes over the past few months that are  2D bar codes, on the overall tram and bus network. When scanning this  bar code with a smartphone, it is possible to get all information about the  network in real time. There is however one inconvenience: The application  is compatible with few mobiles.  POI  point of interest database : This application can be added to the Metro  Paris Subway  receiving Subway alerts in real time . It allows the traveler  to activate Food and Drink POI, Restaurants POI, Coffee, Pastry and Ice  Cream POI, Leisure POI, and Accommodation POI in all over France. It  enables to locate all nearby POI on Google Map.†  *  www.metroparisiphone.com index_en.html. †  https:  itunes.apple.com us app metro-paris-subway id297404959?mt=8.        296  Mobile Electronic Commerce  14.4.5  m-Tourism: The case of Lion’s travel Ten years of networked period for Lion Travel rapidly expand the scope in  2000–2009, not only open a channel with consumers, using the strategy  which both virtual and physical channel, also offers 24 h service to con- sumers, as the Call Center service centers of pioneered tourism, and in  order  to  nurture  talent,  Lion’s  senior  managers  are  also  encouraged  to  enter the EMBA program. Furthermore, since 2010, the mobility period, in  the face of the use of the rise of Mobile, Lion also began to import Mobile  Commerce, and the product furthered audience fragmentation, with dif- ferent themes for different target customers, the main push being custom- ization of goods, and even a cultural and creative inject into the tourism  industry,  and  contributed  to  the  development  of  sophisticated  travel.  Lion’s corporate culture is the most important dialogue with consumers,  from leading the industry to explore new travel trends, and that consumer  satisfaction as a concept, then innovation and investment, both in the prod- ucts or marketing, to take diversified development, and in order to ensure  a leading position in the market, Lion also actively involved in develop- ing new talent to face the future knowledge economy era, the organiza- tion  wants  to  expand,  the  importance  of  talent  will  also  be  increased.  In order to enter the direct sale market, Lion also import Internet, open  e-business models, so that consumers can be 24 h and zero-day to obtain  information and purchase products, and with the rise of mobile devices,  mobile technology in recent years, the Lion also import the development  of mobile positioning and real-time services. In 1990, e-devotion, in 2000,  networked, in 2010, put into action the clouds, after 10 years of their vigor- ously rectifying, the establishment of ICT application of technology as the  core competitiveness of Lion.  On one hand, Lion Travel obtains an advantage in the virtual chan- nel, on the other hand, it did not ignore the physical channel to the actual  situation  in  hand  strategy  and  in  response  to  corporate  globalization,  and gradually in the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand,  Australia, Thailand, Japan, and mainland China and other places to set up  local subsidiaries. And in 2006, it opened the first flagship store in order  to provide 24 h of travel services for consumers and SMEs. Currently, it  has 71 entities worldwide service locations that become Taiwan’s largest  travel agency outlets channel, providing consumers with the most com- plete services. Travel agencies offer cultural space, cafe? Business social  media, content development focus? Lion Travel into the past few years or  even life, cultural, and creative industries of operation, combined with the  tourism outlets “Lion Hin auditorium,” “Lion Café culture space”; shaping  Life Style of complex cultural and creative space, auditorium content not  limited to travel, and further extends to architecture, and culture, music,  food, etc., intended to establish a sense of cultural and creative experience         Chapter fourteen:  e-CRM, m-CRM, and ICTs adoption  297  and  aesthetics  living  area.  Lion  Group  Chairman  Wang  Wenjie  said,  “Tourism into the school of modern tourism has become a Lifestyle!” So  the tourism industry is no longer simply an increase in value, but to show  the force of Taiwanese culture, lion upheld the “Travel is life” philosophy,  and turned the tourism industry into a life estate.  Lion Travel enters into the period of mobilization since 2010, faces the  rise of the use of MOBILE application, Lions do not fall in the trend, the  first to import mobile commerce, the product further massed in full con- gregation for the market, different for different ethnic groups launched  Focus commodities, while pushing the customized products, theme travel,  professional people to lead the way, inject vitality of the cultural and creative  tourism  products,  the  development  of  sophisticated  tourism-oriented,  in order to improve the quality of Taiwan’s tourism effort.

From a global point of view, the development  of the tourism industry, travel agencies, and life has become a trend in  fashion  industry  combined,  for  example,  Japan’s  largest  travel  agency  JTB  Japan Travel Bureau , would be “Your Global Lifestyle Partner” with  the corporate philosophy and the message of “Lifestyle” combined with  travel ideas.  14.5  Conclusions and further research In travel today, where firms’ only communication with its customers often  occur over the Internet, it is more important than ever to have a robust  e-CRM and m-CRM strategy. Firms do not have to spend huge amounts  of money in order to start an e-CRM and m-CRM program for their travel  and  hotel  needs.  Addressing  these  main  aspects  of  firms’  e-CRM  and  m-CRM program: Gaining better knowledge of past and current custom- ers, enhancing all aspects of customer service  both online and offline ,  and  personalizing  firms’  marketing  messages  with  information  that  is  relevant to firms’ customers will result in more premium-driven loyalty  for firms’ travel and hotel products. The study has proved the factors that         298  Mobile Electronic Commerce  affect the tourism and travel industry adopting e-CRM and m-CRM strat- egy, but the industries still need to account their situations in different  context to ensure their best performance.  The tourism and travel industry is one of most high Labor-intensive  industry, if e-CRM and m-CRM strategy adoption, and the study believes  that no matter on technique or interaction with customers, it would get  better than the before. The study also accredit other industries will fol- low  this  trend  of  e-CRM  and  m-CRM  and  join  the  parade.  Is  e-CRM  and m-CRM in Travel a Database Management or a Business Strategy to  Engage the Customer? The most common misconception in the industry  is that CRM in travel and hotel is synonymous with database manage- ment.  Many  hotel travel  companies,  authors,  and  conference  speakers  alike treat CRM as some kind of a technology application. The truth is that  CRM in travel is much more than technology or database management.  CRM and its online applications, e-CRM and m-CRM, are business strate- gies aiming to engage the customer in a mutually beneficial relationship. Within this context, here is the best and most universal description  of e-CRM and m-CRM for any travel company, travel supplier, or online  travel agency: e-CRM and m-CRM, in the context of Internet distribution  and marketing in the travel vertical, is a business strategy supported by  web technologies. It allows travel companies  travel suppliers and online  travel agencies—OTAs  to engage customers in strong, personalized, and  mutually  beneficial  interactive  relationships,  increase  conversions  and  sell more efficiently.  The CSFs of an e-CRM and m-CRM strategy in travel and hotel are   as follows:  1. Developing customer-centric strategies   2. Redesigning workflow management systems   3. Reengineering work processes   4. Supporting with the right technologies   5. Know your customer   6. Customer service   7. Personalization   8. More efficient marketing     9. Build customer loyalty   10. Finding the customers   11. Make them an offer they cannot refuse   12. Present options to the potential customers   13. Keep track of customers   14. Take care of customers’ needs  Establishing mutually beneficial interactive relationships with customers  is the ultimate goal of any e-CRM and m-CRM initiative. Outcomes from         Chapter fourteen:  e-CRM, m-CRM, and ICTs adoption  299  this research will indicate that companies implement e-CRM and m-CRM  for different reasons, and that e-CRM and m-CRM implementation brings  both tangible and intangible benefits to the companies.  Mobile services and web application world is emerging very fast, and in a  couple of years they will have a significant value in the market share, may be  even surpassing the use of desktop applications. This will have a huge impact  in every area of the economy, technology, and service industry. Companies  who adapt to fast-growing mobile market will have a significant advantage  over those who fail to act fast and adapt quickly. A number of companies that  have realized the power of mobility and web interconnection have already  created advanced mobile services and applications and have made signifi- cant  profits,  increasing  their  market  shares.  All  this  can  be  applied  to  the  travel and tourism sector too, making it more modern and more profitable.  The  real  challenge  is  not  the  implementation  of  technology-based  e-CRM and m-CRM solutions itself but rather the adoption of the neces- sary  technological,  organization,  and  cultural  changes  within  the  com- panies.  e-CRM  and  m-CRM  adoption  must  be  coupled  with  customer  intelligence systems. Concerning the organization itself, they must be data  integration interdepartmental communication and links with distributors  and resellers. With regard to the corporate culture, the organization must  be customer-centric in order to provide the best service. All the ingredi- ents would allow e-CRM and m-CRM to contribute to the productivity  and profitability of the tourism organizations.  References Abowd,  G.D.   1997 .

Clinicians and patients demand current information  at  their  fingertips  during  all  phases  of  healthcare  delivery  to  save  time,  reduce errors, and improve outcomes. As a result of the growth of mobile  technology in healthcare, there arises a security challenge to the admin- istrators of the environment to ensure high levels of security and control.  The  healthcare  environment  is  a  prime  target  for  data  and   identity  theft due to the available content and detection capabilities. Mobile devices  can provide unwanted access to a variety of data, including contacts, texts,  calls,  e-mail,  calendars,  internal  systems,  credit  card  information,  and  clinical data. The increases in healthcare security breaches can be tied to  regulation requirements, automation increases, social media development,  and human errors. The economic burden created by these data breaches  in healthcare is estimated at $7 billion annually, with $1 million per orga- nization annually in case of a breach. Risks of breaches are expected to  continue to grow along with mobile technology usage  IDExperts, 2012 .  307   308  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Security is a major priority to healthcare organizations, given that  patients entrust their detailed information to the organizations. When  security monitoring systems are in place, this information is not always  up to date, generate false positives, and the results vary between ven- dors. This chapter provides an overview of security intelligence, with  three modules of mobile security, security methods, and application of  a security defense.  15.2  Mobile security With  an  increased  usage  of  healthcare  information  technology  such  as  e- prescribing,  electronic  health  records   EHRs ,  personal  health  records   PHRs , social media networks, health information exchanges, and mobile  devices, the potential risk of data or information loss has increased  Keckley,  2011 .  Specifically,  with  the  growth  in  mobile   technology,  the  results  of  a  2012  study  that  reviewed  breaches  reported  to  the  US  Department  of  Health and Human Services in response to Health Insurance Portability  and  Accountability  Act   HIPAA   mandates  showed  that  over  60%  of  breaches  occurred  due  to  mobile  devices  that  had  been  lost  or  stolen   Kruger and Anschutz, 2013 .  One  of  the  main  issues  of  the  use  of  information  technology  and  mobile devices in healthcare is the high risk of data loss, a security and  privacy aspect that concerns healthcare staff as well as patients. Defined  by the US Department of Health and Human Services as “an individual  right to control the acquisition, uses, or disclosures of his or her identifi- able health data,” health information privacy is an important aspect of  the patient’s experience. In healthcare, there are at least two main catego- ries of medical records: the EHR, the record created and managed by the  care provider, and the PHR, the record created and managed directly by  the patient. The most popular PHR devices are Microsoft Health Vault  and, previously, Google Health. These products allow users to perform  multiple  operations  “such  as  deleting,  editing,  and  sharing  their  pro- tected health information  PHI  with multiple entities including family,  friends,  and  health  care  professionals,”  but  besides  these  useful  fea- tures, mobile PHR devices have their share of risk  Avancha et al., 2012 . While these methods exist and can be used to reduce the risk of infor- mation theft, a report made in December 2012 in Ponemon’s Third Annual  Benchmark Study on Patient Privacy and Data Security revealed that “81  percent of healthcare organizations permit employees and medical staff to  use their own devices to connect to their organization’s networks or enter- prise systems” and 54% of these people said they were not confident that  the  devices  they  were  using  were  secure   Kruger  and  Anschutz,  2013 .  At the same time, 66% of the nurses declared they used their smartphones         Chapter fifteen:  Security intelligence  309  for clinical communication while 95% of them said that the hospital IT  departments did not support their devices “fearing security risks”  Kruger  and Anschutz, 2013 .  Despite initial security risks and concerns over the use of personal  devices,  the  growth  in  “bring  your  own  device”  and  “bring  your  own  technology” has been increasing and driven primarily by cost reductions,  productivity improvements, and employee satisfaction through allowing  the use of personal smartphone devices. In addition, mobile devices are  able to access cloud-based platforms for storing information and utilized  for daily operational items including notes, documents, messages, other  information that often contains PHI in a healthcare environment, where  clinical  staff  may  take  notes  on  a  patient  or  postclinical  documents  for  clinical review and monitoring  Trend Micro, 2012 .  15.3  Security methods In order to ensure that adequate security is in place for the user of mobile  devices in healthcare, security methods must be employed. In security meth- ods, or the tools and techniques used to prevent security issues, there are  three main categories:  1  authentication and authorization,  2  prevention  and resistance, and  3  detection and response  Baltzan and Phillips, 2012 .  15.3.1  Authentication and authorization Authentication  and  authorization  deals  primary  with  people,  which  is  often the greatest source of security breaches. This includes people both  inside  the  organization  who  may  misuse  or  distribute  their  access  and  outside  the  organization  who  may  include  social  engineering  to  access  information  Baltzan and Phillips, 2012 . The danger can be diverse and  can come from outsiders who are unauthorized to get the information,  from insiders who are authorized users, or even from the patient himself  with the misuse of technology. A report made in 2011 showed that “71  percent of healthcare organizations suffered one or more ePHI breaches  in the course of one year- most of which originated from insiders in one  form or another”  Kruger and Anschutz, 2013 .  The possible threat includes stealing the patient’s identity, an unau- thorized access into the system, or the disclosure of information with neg- ative impact. Identity fraud can be reduced by mechanisms that are used  to authenticate the patient, the provider, or the devices that request access  to the network. In health-related cases, correct authentication is particu- larly important because “in other clinical scenarios, the patient may also  be  motivated  to  cheat  by  attaching  the  sensor  to  a  healthier  friend  or   relative”  Avancha et al., 2012 .        310  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Access threat concerns include inappropriate access but also involve  modification of health records that may be done by mistake or done for   illegal or malicious purpose. The access topic has two main perspectives:  one regarding the role of the patient and the other one concerning the  devices that are allowed to access records, since both these aspects can  have important implications. Disclosure threats, including data at rest and  data in transit, can result in the release of information due to the allow- ance of “data disclosure beyond what was intended by the act of sharing”  or motivated by “financial gain or to embarrass the patient”  Kruger and  Anschutz, 2013 .  In  summary,  “anyone  with  potential  access  to  ePHI  could  pose  a  potential threat to the security of the information”  Kruger and Anschutz,  2013 .  Strong  information  security  policies  and  security  plans  such  as  password and log-on requirements can help prevent these types of issues.  Authentication  confirms  the  user’s  identity,  whereas  authorization  pro- vides the user with an access to the environment. Devices operated using  password  such  as  smart  cards,  tokens,  and  biometrics  are  used  for  the  authentication of the user  Baltzan and Phillips, 2012 .  15.3.2  Prevention and resistance All the advantages that information technology is bringing to the health- care  system  come  with  multiple  challenges  regarding  the  data  security  and privacy. The traditional approach for data protection, the perimeter  approach that describes the internal network of an organization as a perim- eter defined network, is nowadays obsolete due to the extended usage of  mobile devices. Not only that the perimeter can no longer be defined, but  also that the “perimeter-only security ignores the inside threat that exists  when  a  hospital’s  own  staff  or  others  with  access  to  the  organization’s  ePHI maliciously or nonmaliciously access or leak protected health infor- mation”  Kruger and Anschutz, 2013 .  Prevention and resistance deals primarily with data and technolo- gies, including encryption, content filtering, and firewalls. A firewall is  a hardware or software device that analyzes information to detect unau- thorized  use.  Content  filtering  prevents  e-mail  and  spam  from  being  received or transmitted. Encryption requires a special key to decode the  information and make it readable; this is used to keep financial-related  information secure  Baltzan and Phillips, 2012 .  Encryption  is  one  efficient  method  of  maintaining  the  safety  and  privacy  of  the  data  used  by  many  healthcare  providers.  This  is  a  rel- atively  low-cost  data  protection  method  averaging  at  about  $55  per  computer. According to a survey conducted in 2012 by the Healthcare  Information and Management Systems Society, only 64% of healthcare         Chapter fifteen:  Security intelligence  311  organizations were using encryption when transmitting data. The rest  of  36%  were  not  using  encryption  even  though  since  2005  all  data  handlers  have  been  required  to  follow  the  HIPPA  security  standards   Kruger and Anschutz, 2013; Conn, 2013 .  The  risk  in  transmitting  or  even  storing  unencrypted  data  is  high.  One example is the case of the stealing of four computers, in July 2012,  from Advocate Medical Group located in Park Ridge, Illinois, which was  followed by another similar case that took place in November 2009 affect- ing the medical records of 812 patients of Advocate. Although the data  contained in the stolen computers was varied and not highly private, “we  are  certainly  not  trying  to  state  that  this  information  couldn’t  be  used  inappropriately,”  said  Kelly  Jo  Golson,  senior  vice  president  and  chief  marketing  officer  for  Advocate  Health  Care,  based  in  Downers  Grove,  Illinois. Multiple existing methods can be used to make it possible for data  to be “decrypted only when a legitimate user on a known device using  an approved application opens them,” which can significantly reduce the  risk of data theft  Kruger and Anschutz, 2013 .  15.3.3  Detection and response Detection and response deals primarily with attacks by analyzing suspi- cious activities such as password attempts or file access. Intrusion detec- tion software will monitor and alert if patterns are detected and can even  shut down part of the network as warranted  Baltzan and Phillips, 2012 .  Organizational users need advanced tools similar to those of malicious  users being used to compromise the systems. Security Intelligence and  event monitoring systems analyze network, user, application, and datas- ets to identify trends, behaviors, and incidents  LogRhythm, 2012 .  For  dataset  inputs,  these  include  firewall,  network,  system,  appli- cation, rules, and other event logs. These logs are then normalized to a  standard format for review. Once standardized, the data are analyzed for  patterns, and alerts are generated for user review. Examples of analysis  methods include aggregation and categorization of logs and events, time  of events and directions, statistical log, source and host information, and  top items within various categories for further detailed drill-down and  analysis. Examples of analysis output include the ability to detect unusual  application behaviors, unusual network connections, user behavior, net- work baseline deviations, and compromised credentials. Other methods  analyze historical data to recreate scenarios for auditing and also generate  detailed and summary reporting output for security professionals, com- pliance officials, or other end users to review. Organizations are begin- ning to establish a security center in which monitoring and investigations  occur  LogRhythm, 2012 .        312  Mobile Electronic Commerce  15.4  Security defense Healthcare  security  breaches  have  become  a  common  catastrophe.  In  a  recent  study,  94%  of  healthcare  organizations  suffered  a  data  breach  in  the last 2 years, and nearly half experienced more than five data breaches  in  the  last  2  years.  In  2010,  a  flash  drive  with  PHI  of  280,000  members  was stolen from a health plan. In 2006, a laptop and a disk with PHI of  26.5   million  veterans  were  stolen  from  an  employee’s  home.  Since  the  enforcement  of  the  HIPAA,  over  11,000  HIPAA  violations  have  been  reviewed, and 7  million patients have been impacted  Keckley, 2011 .  Despite security risks, there are many benefits to healthcare mobile  usage. At ASAN Medical Center in Seoul, the staff is using smartphones  and  laptops  to  improve  productivity,  diagnostics,  and  problem  solving  up  to  three  times  faster  by  keying  and  accessing  information  directly  on their mobile devices  HP, 2012 . In 2009, the American Recovery and  Reinvestment  Act   ARRA   was  enforced,  which  also  included  compo- nents from the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical  Health  HITECH  Act. These improved HIPAA enforcement for privacy  and security safeguards, along with increased penalties and accountabil- ity  Keckley, 2011 .  Healthcare organizations must implement safeguards to address new  security concerns as a result of increased electronification as well as com- ply with enforced laws  CMS, 2007 . The primary components of a secu- rity defense include physical, technical, and organizational safeguards.  Technical safeguards include unique user identification, automatic  log-off, encryption, having a responsible person to authorize and verify  passwords,  strong  passwords,  locking  accounts  after  invalid  log-ins,  and deactivating employee accounts after termination. From a mobile  perspective, endpoint access should also be verified and permitted or  prevented from accessing the network, including monitoring and noti- fication of an unauthorized device. Wireless threats should be detected  and prevented through security policies and location tracking. Security  compliance  should  be  kept  by  administrators  to  verify  personally  owned  and  operated  devices  to  ensure  compliance   Iron  Mountain,  2010; HP, 2012; Thrasher and Revels, 2012 .  Physical safeguards include protecting facility access against unau- thorized entry, as well as security workstations, transportation, and stor- age of media and information. However, physical safeguards also apply  well  behind  the  walls  of  an  organization.  Stanford’s  Lucille  Packard  Children’s Hospital announced a breach of 57,000 patients due to a sto- len  laptop  from  a  physician’s  vehicle.  Gibson  Hospital  in  Indiana  also  reported a breach of 29,000 patients due to a laptop being stolen from an  employee’s home.        Chapter fifteen:  Security intelligence  313  Organizational  safeguards  include  business  associate  agreements   BAAs ,  customer  requirements,  and  policies  and  procedures.  BAAs  should be updated to eliminate breaches and enforce liability that may  not be covered under the law. A business associate is anyone who works  on behalf of a healthcare entity and uses or discloses PHI  Keckley, 2011 .  References Avancha, S., Baxi, A., and Kotz, D.

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  before  the  year  2000,  ATM  terminals, for instance, were nonexistent in most parts of the sub- Saharan  Africa   SSA .  Today,  this  channel  of  bank  service  delivery  has  been  fully  integrated  into  the  economic  and  social  fabrics  of  the  entire  African society. Unlike the era when ATM card ownership was restricted   315   316  Mobile Electronic Commerce  to high-end bank customers, now, in most parts of the continent, having  a bank account overwhelmingly qualifies an individual to be issued with  an ATM card. Similarly, before the 1990s, telephone services and telephone  line   ownership  was  an  exclusive  preserve  of  rich  individuals  and  busi- nesses in Africa. Then, only fixed landline telephones were in existence;  and  the  average  telephone  penetration  rate  in  the  SSA  region    was  just  0.86 per 100 persons in 1985, compared with 1.48 and 1.57 per 100 persons  in 2000 and 2005, respectively  based on the data from World Development  Indicators . The recorded increase was largely due to the emergence and  increase in the popularity of the mobile telephone system in most parts  of the continent. The erstwhile barrier against telephone ownership and  access  has  consequently  been  dismantled—thus  making  mobile  phone  emergence  an  effective  tool  for  bridging  the  digital  divide  between  the  rich and the poor  Helton, 2012 .  No  doubt,  the  value  and  importance  of  the  payment  and  telecom- munication  revolutions  continues  to  be  on  the  increase.  There  are  for  instance, a number of empirical studies linking each to economic growth  and development. Abraham  2007  used the Indian case to demonstrate  how the mobile phone improved the supply chain and enhanced the liv- ing standard of Indian fishermen. Another study by GSM Association and  Deloitte  revealed  that  a  doubling  of  mobile  data  use  brought  about  an  “increase of 0.5 percentage points in the GDP per capita growth rate across  selected 14 countries, and that countries with higher level of data usage  per 3G connection had seen increases in GDP per capita growth exceed- ing a percentage point”  GSM Association, 2012 . Regarding the impact of  the ATM, the summary of a 56-country study on the impact of electronic  payment on economic growth by Moody’s Analyst  2013  showed that  1   the  increased  usage  of  electronic  payment  products  added  $983  billion  in real  US  dollars to GDP in the countries studied;  2  card usage raised  consumption by an average of 0.7% across the 56 countries;  3  that con- sumption contributed to average additional growth in GDP of 0.17% point  per year for this group of countries. The study further indicated that real  global GDP grew by an average of 1.8% during that time period in those  countries;  the  additional  GDP  growth  was  realized  solely  by  increased  card  usage  and  penetration  was  equivalent  to  creating  1.9  million  jobs  during the period of study; and that “a future 1% increase in card usage  across  the  countries  in  the  study  would  produce  an  annual  increase  of  0.056% in consumption and a 0.032% increase in GDP”.  In addition to this interesting revelation, industry practitioners and  policymakers  have  remained  constantly  in  search  of  optimal  strategies  that can guarantee more inclusive financial and economic systems, as well  as efficient business operations. The argument in this direction is that an  inclusive financial economic system is capable of lifting a huge percent- age of the world’s population from poverty.        Chapter sixteen:  Automated teller machine  317  While  in  some  countries  in  Africa,  telecom  adoption  is  still  at  the  experimental stage, in a good number of others, mobile telephone is fully  integrated into the mainstream banking and business operations. Nigeria  is one of the countries where ATM and mobile telephone interface is speed- ily evolving, with both having a very recent history. The first ATM in the  country, for instance, was introduced for the high net worth customers of  the defunct Societe Generale Bank in 1989. However, the adoption of the  InterSwitch ATM system in 2003 brought about an increase in the number  and  rate  of  its  use  in  the  mainstream  banking  business  in  the  country.  Since then, there has been a massive increase in the number and usage of  ATMs, which is largely due to regulatory reforms and market dynamisms.  A report from InterSwitch, the largest of the four major global card opera- tors in the country  others are QuickCash, ETranzact, and VPay , indicates  that the number of ATM cards grew from 7 million in 2010 to 11 million in  2011 and 26 million in 2012  Oketola, 2012 .  In the same vein, mobile  GSM  phone system was introduced in the  country in the year 2000, and has since then been increasingly used as a  support  tool  for  business  operations.  Banks  have  also  taken  advantage  of the increasing popularity of mobile telephone as an essential business  support tool to develop new mobile banking products. Thus, as in the case  of most other developing countries, the boom in the mobile banking ser- vices effectively coincided with the era of the increasing wave of mobile  telephone penetration.  Customers’ mobile phone numbers are today effectively linked to their  individual bank accounts. This provides opportunities for the customers  to access banking services via dedicated telephone lines from the comfort  of homes and offices, check account balance, authorize interbranch money  transfer, and get transaction alerts. With mobile telephone banking, cus- tomers can instantly get notification via short message service  SMS  or  e-mail on every transaction that takes place in their respective accounts.  Specifically, this chapter discusses issues on the relationship between  ATM  and  mobile  phone  penetration;  the  benefits  of  an  effective  ATM– mobile phone interface; and the regulatory and policy framework for such  technology  interface  in  an  emerging  financial  system  such  as  Nigeria.  To do this, extensive theoretical and empirical literature review on the link  between ICT innovation and banking development is carried out. This is  followed by a review of mainstream publications on electronic banking  and banking regulations and telecommunication development in Nigeria,  and a statistical analysis of data on ATM and mobile phone penetration in  a sample of SSA countries. Broadly, the chapter draws inference from and  builds on the existing literature on inclusive banking system, electronic  banking, information and communication technology adoption, and pen- etration, as well as the emerging challenges of technology-induced bank- ing regulations.        318  16.2    Nature and benefits of ATM  and mobile phone interface  Mobile Electronic Commerce  There are well documented empirical and theoretical evidence that effec- tive  ICT  deployment  generally  promotes  and  facilitates  business  growth   Parent and Cruickshank, 2009; Byrne et al., 2011; Vu, 2011; Bilbao-Osorio  et al., 2012; Sassi and Goaied, 2013 . Arguably, ICT protocols that have more  significantly  influenced  economic  and  financial  system  development  in  recent times are the Internet and mobile phone. Among others, the Internet  specifically assists businesses through the reduction in information costs  and the expansion of business opportunities and platforms  Comptroller’s  Handbook, 1999; Calisir and Gumussoy, 2008; Ezeoha, 2010; Alonso et al.,  2013 . Evidence on the economic impact of mobile phone is equally well doc- umented  see for instance Michalakelis et al., 2008; Singh, 2008; Funk, 2009;  Porter et al., 2012; Asongu, 2013; Qureshi, 2013 . There are also arguments  that favor the existence of a significant interactive impact of mobile banking  and mobile phone, especially in the developing economies. Beshouri and  Gravråk   2010   have,  for  instance,  posited  that  the  emerging  high  mobile  phone penetration and limited branch network of commercial banks and  microlenders  is  capable  of  driving  the  growth  of  mobile  money  in  the  emerging markets of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa, where it is expected  to cross one billion users; and specifically in Africa where it is estimated to  grow to a US$22 billion industry across Africa by 2015.  Mobile banking has however been shown to offer more feasible bene- fits in an environment where there is a reasonable degree of mobile phone  penetration.  Rajnish  and  Stephan   2007   highlight  that  the  operational  scope of a telecom-based mobile banking can cover both the conduct of a  bank’s account system administration, customer services, and even stock  market operations. Specifically, Pousttchi and Schurig  2004  have argued  that the expansion in mobile banking operations around the world coin- cided with the advent of mobile telephone. It is this coincidence that has  revolutionalized the platform for banking services delivery and payment  systems in different developing economies  Sullivan, 2007 . A unique out- come of this has been an increased sophistication in mobile banking and  the growth from mere informational usage to more interactive applica- tions. This development has some positive implications on the well-being  of the overall banking system, especially with regard to:     The  transaction  cost  reduction  channel—which  creates  a  platform  for moderating the deterring high cost features that are associated  with the conventional banking technique. Such an interface is capa- ble of reducing the cost of basic banking services and making them  affordable to customers  Datta et al., 2001 .        Chapter sixteen:  Automated teller machine  319     Information  dissemination  channel—this  provides  medium  for  wider  and  effective  dissemination  of  information,  awareness,  and  outreach.     The  Security  channel—which  can  happen  because  such  interface   helps bridge the communication gap.  Specifically  on  the  benefits  to  end  users,  Goswami  and  Raghavendran   2009   identify  the  advantages  of  mobile  banking  to  include:   1   secure  authentication,  transaction  and  data  transmission,  and  easy  deleting  of  content in the event of handset loss;  2  icon-driven, user-friendly inter- face;  3  contactless payment that offers quicker checkout at the  point of  sale and replaces all current payment solutions;  4  dynamic credit facil- ity  and  innovative  point-of-sale  offers;   5   dynamic  account  monitoring  and around-the-clock alerts;  6  convenience of micropayments  parking  meters,  vending  machines ;   7   real-time  access  to  account  information,  outstanding debt, and bill payment;  8  ubiquitous access to banking ser- vices  personal ATM .  In  all,  three  key  arguments  can  be  drawn  from  the  existing  litera- ture to demonstrate how the link between ATM and mobile phone could  provide  the  opportunities  for  enhancing  inclusive  banking  in  Africa.  These include pluralism, business efficiency, and economic development  arguments.  16.2.1  Pluralism argument Mobile  phone  use  is  rapidly  becoming  an  important  part  of  everyday  life in most societies, even in poor households  Porter et al., 2012 . This  implies that a banking service delivery protocol that is built on the mobile  phone  channel  is  capable  of  encouraging  the  inclusion  of  greater  per- centage of the bankable population  Mishra and Bisht, 2013 . Karjauoto   2002   illustrate  that  among  the  factors  that  have  helped  to  popularize  mobile banking are the low fees, time saving, and freedom from time  and place that characterize most handheld devices. Aided by the emer- gence of mobile phone and ATM, banks are now able to serve custom- ers outside the banking hall. ATM, consequently, performs some of the  traditional  functions  of  bank  cashiers  and  other  counter  staff—among  which  include  withdrawing  cash  from  one’s  account,  making  balance  inquiries, transferring money from one account to another, payment of  bill,  printing  of  statement,  etc.  An  emerging  proposition,  therefore,  is  that linking personal GSM telephone lines to ATM cardholding can help  encourage  inclusive  banking  by  drawing  more  prospective  customers  into the banking system and by widening the catchment areas of banks   Alonso et al., 2013 .        320  Mobile Electronic Commerce  16.2.2  Business efficiency argument Mobile phone use brings about significant reduction in business opera- tions  and  transaction  costs   Aker  and  Mbiti,  2010;  Qureshi,  2013 .  This  benefit  provides  a  strong  premise  for  increased  acceptability  of  mobile  phone platforms by banks and the sustainability of their acquisition and  use by customers  Gupta, 2013 . In addition, the adoption of ATM tech- nology  is  also  argued  to  have  increased  community  efficiency  through  improvement  in  quality  of  service  delivery  and  enhancement  of  value- added service to customers  Kamel, 2005 . The increasing wave of mobile  technology  innovations  thus  helps  moderate  the  effects  of  traditional  banking challenges. This in itself holds great opportunities for banks hav- ing difficulty providing profitable services to minority customers through  the traditional channels  Mishra and Bisht, 2013 . However, the capacity  of the banking system to take advantage of the potentials of such telecom  innovations is dependent on the quality and stability of banking regula- tion, the strength of the overall financial sector, the state of infrastructural  development, and the level of ICT knowledge base in the affected coun- tries  Sarokolaei et al., 2012 .  16.2.3  Economic development argument There is empirical evidence that mobile phone adoption and penetration  aid growth in both the upper-low-income and the low-income countries  in Africa  Chavula, 2013 . Mobile phone can also serve as a vehicle for  facilitating economic activities and growth in the medium to long term.  Because  a  huge  and  vibrant  informal  cash  economy  exists  in  almost  all  SSA  countries  and  because  the  economies  are  dominated  largely  by  unbanked  small  and  microscale  businesses,  broad-based  business  platform,  such  as  mobile  banking  and  telecommunication,  provides  a  magnetic  framework  for  an  inclusive  economic  practice.  Channeling  funds in the informal cash sector through the formal banking system is  therefore capable of bolstering economic development  Global Financial  Development Report, 2014 . In summary, Aker and Mbiti  2010  identify  five potential mechanisms through which mobile phone aids economic  development, namely:  1. The  capacity  of  mobile  phone  to  improve  access  to  and  use  of            information  enhanced supply chain  and urban population  2. The capacity to provide opportunity for business efficiency through   3. The  capacity  to  provide  income-generating  opportunities  to  rural         Chapter sixteen:  Automated teller machine  321        4. The  possibility  of  facilitating  information  sharing  and  reduced   households’ risk exposures  5. The possibility of facilitating essential services delivery, especially   in the areas of health, education, and agriculture  Essentially, transaction-based and nontransaction-based mobile banking  exist.  Transaction-based  includes  funds  transfer remittances  and  pay- ment via the mobile device. However, by their nature, transaction-based  services require more advanced ICT facilities such as smartphones, iPods,  and Blackberry. These advanced mobile phones can be used as Internet  access points and can result in the provision of two fundamental customer  services: instant access to an account, and the ability to make payments  and transfers remotely. More generally, the mobile phone device and wire- less connectivity bring the Internet terminal into the hands of otherwise  unbanked  customers.  On  the  other  hand,  nontransaction  mobile  bank- ing is more or less informative in nature and is specifically dedicated for  balance inquiries and short bank statement issuance, transaction alerts,  product communication, loan account follow-up, and other information- sharing activities between the bank and the customers. Figure 16.1 illus- trates  this  trend  and  reveals  the  interactive  capacity  of  mobile  phone  devices at each of the different developmental stages.  Transational stage: e.g.,  e-payment and  receipt  Communicative  stage: e.g.,  account inquiry  and service requests  Informative stage: e.g.,  account balance  alert and promotional  services  Figure 16.1  Stages of mobile phone banking development.        322  Mobile Electronic Commerce  16.3  Pre-e-banking environment in Nigeria Historically, banking business started in Nigeria in 1892 as an ordinary  commercial venture with no particular government emphasis on regula- tion or control. On the other hand, modern banking system took off in  the country in 1952 following the enactment of the Banking Ordinance of  1952. The Ordinance itself was the first major attempt by the government  to regulate the business of banking in the country and was designed to  prescribe legal basis for the issuance of banking license, lay down rules  and procedures for the conduct of banking business, and minimum capi- tal and reserve structures for banks  Ezeoha, 2007 .  Until  the  mid-1990s,  Nigerian  banks  operated  under  a  system  that  was paper-based and could be described as purely armchair banking. The  use  of  computer  and  other  electronic  platforms  in  the  delivery  of  bank  services and management of banking operations was then visibly absent.  Such banking era could, in the context of this paper, be classified as part of   preelectronic banking history and was essentially characterized by a num- ber of regulatory and structural issues. First, the Structural Adjustment  Programme  SAP  adopted by the Nigerian government in 1986 was to be  one of the most radical regulatory events in financial system development  in  the  country.  On  the  positive  side,  SAP  widened  the  financial  system  landscape by increasing the level of participation by both domestic and  foreign banks, and by providing significant incentives for financial prod- uct development and outreach. On the negative side, the program brought  with it an extensive deregulation of the Nigerian economy, created oppor- tunities for outright evasion of banking and financial laws in the country,  and made it possible for some new banks to survive and prosper by mainly  buying and selling foreign exchange  Uche, 2000 . One way SAP-motivated  reforms injected instability in the system was through the relaxation of  the entry conditions of new banks. By loosening the regulatory require- ments for the granting of bank licenses, for instance, promoters borrowed  funds on short-term basis to float banks, and only for the new banks to be  stripped of the capital shortly after the acquisition of their licenses  Central  Bank of Nigeria, 2001 . The visible outcome was the early collapse of such  banks and incessant financial distress in the system, which in itself cul- minated in the Central Bank of Nigeria placing embargo in 1991  up until  1998  on the licensing of more banks in the country  Ezeoha, 2010 . It was  consequent to this development that SAP was discontinued in 1996 as part  of the strategies to instill sanity not only in the financial system but also  in the economy as a whole. Yet, not much success was recorded consider- ing that in 1998, for instance, as many as 26  out of 115 licensed banks  had  been liquidated by the Central Bank of Nigeria  Ezeoha, 2007 .  Specifically, attempts to curb the persistent distress in the financial  system and minimize the rising level of intra-industry squabbles among         Chapter sixteen:  Automated teller machine  323  operators also led to the prescription and adoption of universal banking  model by the Central Bank in 2001. Among other numerous consequences  of this model were the eradication of the usual regulatory and operational  differences between merchant and commercial banking in the country;  increased fragility and rigidity due to weak regulatory capacity and over- laps on the side of the CBN and the resultant system abuses and vulner- ability   Uche,  2001 .  By  implication,  the  universal  banking  practice  was  unable to resolve the predicated issue of persistent distress in the financial  system. Instead, as argued by Ezeoha  2010, 2007 , it brought with it more  chronic challenges such as:                 1. Rigidity in the ownership structures of banks—resulting in a good  number  of  the  banks  being  privately  and  closely  held,  with  thick  family and personal links  2. Visible disconnection between the banking industry and the capital  market—which resulted in a lack of access to the capital market, very  high information asymmetry, overreliance on public sector deposits,  illegal and unprofessional competition for funds, and loss of enough  public confidence required to run efficiently  3. Uneven  distribution  in  the  size  and  structure  of  the  industry—  leading to the emergence of too many small banks that were neither  well capitalized nor better managed and the resultant dominance of  the industry by just about 5 out of the 89 banks  4. Deficiency in the intermediation process—which reflected hugely in  the dominance of short-term loans and deposits, as well as increased  monetization of the economy  5. Regulatory  inconsistence  and  increased  incidence  of  frauds,  espe- cially in the areas of fraudulent transfer and withdrawals of funds,  presentation  of  forged  checks,  granting  of  unauthorized  credits,  posting  of  fictitious  credits,  check  and  cash  defalcation,  outright  theft, and bank robbery  It was indeed those challenges that led to the structural reforms that took  place between 2004 and 2005. The banking consolidation reform, as it was  popularly referred to, provided for the increase in minimum capital base  of depositing money in banks from 2 billion to 25 billion Nigerian Naira,  convergence of the industry from 89 to 25 banks, eradication of government  ownership influence in the banking industry, reemergence of foreign banks,  increased participation of banks in the capital market, as well as diversifica- tion of Nigerian banks into other African countries  Ezeoha, 2007 . On the  downside, the structural reform was unable to induce the required level  of financial system inclusion necessary to ensure effective and adequate  funding of small- and medium-scale enterprises and other minority sec- tors such as agriculture and manufacturing  Ezeoha and Amaeshi, 2010 .         324  Mobile Electronic Commerce  The desired level of banking efficiency could also not be attained largely  due to the inability of the reform to account for systemic challenges such  as poor integration of governance and operational protocols, nationwide  infrastructural deficiencies, and poor culture of regulation enforcement.  Consequent  to  the  2007 2008  global  economic  and  financial  crisis,  the CBN had in 2009 raised alarm that the banking industry was highly  infested with systemic distress and risks. The regulatory authority noted  then that 8 out of 25 banks that survived the 2004 2005 industry consoli- dation were technically distressed. The financial situations of the affected  banks  were  so  bad  that  the  central  bank  spent  as  much  as  620  billion  Nigerian Naira  or US$4 billion  to bail them out.  A major regulatory goal that remained relatively unchanged amid the  regimes of structural reforms in the country mentioned earlier was the  need  to  make  the  banking  industry  more  competitive  and  attractive  to  investors. More so, the timing of some of the industry reforms coincided  with  the  period  of  ICT  revolution  in  the  country.  For  instance,  massive  computerization of banking process and operations in the 1990s was occa- sioned by the fact that right from the late 1980s, banks had started suffer- ing serious deterioration in their levels of operating efficiency, leading to  the consequent rise in operating cost over and above operating income   Ezeoha, 2010 . Thus, to survive the stiff banking competition during that  period,  banks  had  to  take  advantage  of  the  rising  profiles  of  electronic  banking protocols that were capable of offering cost-reduction opportu- nities. It was also the search for cheaper operational media that brought  about the adoption and popularization of ATMs by Nigerian banks dur- ing the same period. However, issues relating to the cost of adoption and  requisite expertise posed a major constraint on the capacity of banks to  fully computerize their operations in the 1990s. This is reflective in the  fact that as of June 2004, only about 7 out of the 89 banks then in operation  offered  ATM  services.  Apart  from  issues  relating  to  cost  and  technical  expertise,  fraud  was  also  a  key  constraining  force  for  electronic  bank- ing services in the country. The 419 fraud, for instance, ranks among the  top cyber frauds in the world, and remains the most popular of Internet  frauds  globally  linked  to  Nigeria,  with  a  very  serious  negative  threat  to  public  confidence  in  electronic  business  transactions   Ezeoha,  2010 .  This was so much so that the Nigerian government in 2006 enacted the  Advanced  Fee  Fraud   419   Act,  dedicated  specifically  to  deal  with  such  economic  crime.  The  banking  public  were  also  skeptical  in  transacting  businesses through electronic media because of the alleged vulnerability  of such platforms to fraud and technical failures. the CBN in recognition  of  the  high  incidence  of  card  frauds  in  the  country,  in  a  February  2011  circular on “the Need to Combat Card Fraud” directed banks, among oth- ers, to apply proper KYC  know your customer  for issuance of cash cards;  set limit and ensure second level authentication for card to card transfers,         Chapter sixteen:  Automated teller machine  325  POS  point of purchase , and web payments; give cardholders options to  choose channels for which their cards will be applied; and restrict cash  card usage for payment of services specifically to the agreed schemes.  Notwithstanding  the  threat  posed  by  this  peculiar  electronic  busi- ness fraud in Nigeria, there have been other system-wide developments  that  made  the  business  model  indispensable  and  appealing,  especially  in  the  banking  industry.  One  of  such  development  was  the  emergence  of GSM in 2001, which coincided with the later introduction of universal  banking in the country. The emergence of GSM itself facilitated informa- tion  flow  and  outreach,  and  equally  reduced  the  geographical  barriers  against financial intermediation. Taking advantage of the opportunities  offered by the telecommunication development was in itself facilitated by  the general banking industry reform of 2004 2005. The reform provided  surviving banks with huge financial resources needed for comprehensive  ICT redeployment. As argued by Ezeoha  2010 , the consolidation exercise  offered banks the opportunity to increase their capital bases and be able  to  update  their  technological  infrastructures.  With  the  advancement  in  technology  awareness  and  improvement  in  the  telecommunication  sys- tem, banks in Nigeria went on to install a number of electronic banking  protocols and service delivery platforms that could more efficiently link  them to the customers. With mobile phone introduction, the deployment  and use of ATM as a service delivery channel, for instance, shifted from  a strategic focus on privileged customers to a policy effort for attaining  inclusive financial system.  Certain other features of the Nigerian banking system that facilitated  the shift from traditional to modern technology-based banking emanated  from the inherent structural rigidities in the system. The industry itself  was characterized by exclusionary practices arising from a prevalent low  banking density in the country and the resulting exclusion of a greater  percentage of economic agents from the system; high rigidity challenges,  including  delay  in  essential  service  delivery  due  to  manual  system  of  operation; poor policy transmission and response to global dynamics, as  well as the inability to inclusively attend to the banking needs of the citi- zens. Before the introduction of electronic payment into the system, cus- tomers had to walk into the banking hall to do transactions of all kinds.  They had to queue up and spend more hours to talk to a teller and other  bank staff to make their transactions. Thus, any policy with promises of  resolving those background issues was expected to enjoy favorable pub- lic reception.  The  inherent  features  and  benefits  of  ATM  channel  consequently  facilitated acceptability and assimilation by the bank customers. Broadly,  ATM  functions  prominently  as  a  way  of  easing  the  human  traffic  in   banking  halls  and  as  well  respond  to  the  changing  nature  of  modern  banking operations. It also offers high level of flexibility and convenience         326  Mobile Electronic Commerce  to customers. In addition, some regulatory push from the CBN has equally  helped in improving the rate of ATM penetration in the country. There is  for instance, at the moment, a policy directive requiring banks  to  limit  the  amount  of  over-the-counter  cash  payments  to  bank  customers  and  requesting bank customers withdrawing a certain threshold amount to  do so through ATM or pay charges for withdrawing in the banking hall.  Despite the advantages and policy incentive that go with the ATM opera- tions, some have continued to avoid the use of such electronic banking  modes, largely due to the persistent incidence of fraud and technical fail- ures associated with such operations.  16.4    Emergence of ICT-based banking  regime in Nigeria  The use of ICT in the delivery of banking services is generally referred  to  as  electronic  banking   e-banking .  The  application  of  its  concepts,  techniques,  policies,  and  implementation  strategies  to  banking  services  has  become  a  subject  of  fundamental  importance  and  concerns  to  all  banks.  It  has  also  become  a  prerequisite  for  local  and  global  banking  competitiveness.  In  the  case  of  Nigeria,  major  Information  and  Communication  Technology  ICT  revolution did not occur until the late 1990s. In fact,  the use of ICT as a complementary business model became more visibly  in  place  from  2004.  This  was  made  more  prominent  by  the  licensing  of GSM operators earlier in 2000 and the consequent issuance of GSM  telephone lines to the general public in 2001. By 2011, a GSM Association  report  on  Africa  had  revealed  Nigeria  as  having  the  highest  num- ber  of  mobile  phone  subscriptions  in  Africa—standing  at  more  than  93   million,  representing  16%  of  the  continent’s  total  mobile  subscrip- tions  Saliu, 2011 .  Mobile  phone  operation  in  the  country  was  further  boosted  by  the  introduction  of  a  National  Policy  on  Information  and  Technology  in  January 2002. The aim of the policy, among others, was to lay emphasis  on the need to effectively deploy information technology in the promo- tion and support of private sector industrial growth in Nigeria. Consistent  with this critical mandate, section 8.2 of the policy specifically identified  the objectives of the country’s IT development to include the need        1. To develop a transparent, stable, and effective legal operating envi- ronment that promotes private sector business and investment in IT 2. To cultivate a culture of electronic commerce, which makes business  transactions  easy,  quick,  and  cost-effective,  for  both  national  and  international transactions        Chapter sixteen:  Automated teller machine  327  3. To positively raise the local and international visibility of Nigerian   businesses  4. To  encourage  foreign  and  domestic  private  sectors  investment  to  build  information  infrastructure  and  related  assets  and  develop  subsequent downmarket activities  5. To  stimulate  the  proliferation  of  information  technology  services  led  by  the  private  sector  and  consequently  generates  meaningful  employment opportunities for Nigerians  Another major development within the period was the formation, in 2003,  of  the  Nigerian  Communication  Commission   NCC ,  which  was  estab- lished by the Act of Parliament  the Nigerian Communication Commission  Act of 2003 , with the core mandates to establish a regulatory framework  for  the  Nigerian communications industry and  for this purpose to cre- ate an effective impartial and independent regulatory authority; and to  promote  the  provision  of  modern,  universal,  efficient,  reliable,  afford- able, and easily accessible communications services and the widest range  thereof throughout Nigeria  Chapter 1, No. 1, Nigerian Communication  Commission Act, 2003 . Specifically, Chapter 4, No. 1 of the Act mandates  the NCC to, among others, carry out the following functions:  1. The facilitation of investments in and entry into the Nigerian market  for  provision  and  supply  of  communications  services,  equipment,  and facilities  2. The protection and promotion of the interests of consumers against  unfair practices including but not limited to matters relating to tar- iffs and charges for and the availability and quality of communica- tions services, equipment, and facilities  3. The promotion of fair competition in the communications industry  and protection of communications services and facilities providers  from misuse of market power or anticompetitive and unfair prac- tices by other service or facilities providers or equipment suppliers  4. Granting and renewing communications licenses whether or not the  licenses themselves provide for renewal in accordance with the pro- visions of this Act and monitoring and enforcing compliance with  license terms and conditions by licensees  5. Fixing and collecting fees for grant of communications licenses and   other regulatory services provided by the Commission  6. The  development  and  monitoring  of  performance  standards  and  indices relating to the quality of telephone and other communica- tions services and facilities supplied to consumers in Nigeria with  regard to the best international performance indicators  7. Making and enforcing such regulations as may be necessary under   this Act to give full force and effect to the provisions of this Act                                      328  Mobile Electronic Commerce     8.

This is also supported by the growth  in the use of other ICT protocols by Nigerians, especially with regard to  the Internet that recorded a rise in penetration rate from 0.10% in 2000 to  28.3% as at March 2011.  Figures 16.2 through 16.6 show the huge progress recorded by Nigeria  in the telecom sector within the last decade.

In similar vein, increased  rate  of  Internet  penetration  in  the  country  maintained  a  higher  trend  than that of SSA average beginning from 2005. The country also recorded  a  higher  fit,  in  terms  of  ATM  penetration  during  the  same  period.

Due to  the lack of long series data, a robust and efficient country-level empirical  analysis in this regard is unfeasible. To test this foregoing hypothesis and  based on data availability, we however constructed a panel data from 27  SSA countries over the years 2004–2011 and carried out both pooled and  panel regression analysis. The procedure for and results of this empirical  exercise are reported in section 7.        Chapter sixteen:  Automated teller machine  331  Through  the  use  of  ICT,  Nigerian  banks  now  employ  different   channels such as Internet technology, video banking technology, mobile  telephone banking, ATM, and WAP technology to deliver most of their  services  Ayo et al., 2010 . Existing statistical records, for example, reveal  that ATM remains the most widely used e-payment instrument in Nigeria.  For  instance,  data  on  various  e-payment  channels  according  to  Central  Bank of Nigeria  2012  indicated that ATM with a total number of 10,221  as of end of June 2012 was the most patronized, accounting for 96.4%. This  is followed by mobile payments with 1.3% and POS terminals with 1.2%.  The web  Internet banking  was the least patronized, accounting for only  1.1% of total e-payment transactions. The result of research by Okechi and  Kepeghom  2013 , on empirical evaluation of customers’ use of electronic  banking systems in Nigeria equally shows that among all e-banking sys- tems, ATM has the highest level of usage. Also, Adesina and Ayo  2010   stated that ATM is responsible for about 89%  in volume  of all e-payment  instruments between 2006 and 2008.  The  growth  in  ATM  usage  rate  also  reflects  the  practice  of  mul- tiple accounts holding by bank customers. Thus, a bank customer with  accounts in two or more banks would expectedly have a corresponding  number of ATM cards. The implication is that in some cases, the number  of ATM cards in circulation may not effectively represent higher baking  density or inclusion.  16.5  ATM operational environment in Nigeria ATM  applications  dominate  the  spectrum  of  today’s  Nigerian  banking  system. Societe Generale Bank  SGBNS , now Heritage Bank, was the first  bank to introduce ATM  NCR machine  in 1989 at their Broad Street and  Apapa Branches in Lagos. The trade name for SGBN’s ATM was “Cash  Point 24.” First Bank of Nigeria Plc came on stream with its own ATM in  December 1991, a year behind SGBN. It also gave a trade name “FIRST  CASH” to its ATM. At the introduction of the ATM in 1989, the machines  looked  complex  and  preserved  for  the  top-edge  of  banking  customers.  Today,  all  the  banks  in  Nigeria  have  adopted  the  technology  and  have  invested huge sums of money in the deployment of the ATM and toward  the  issuance  of  ATM  debit  cards.  A  study  by  Adesina  and  Ayo   2010   found that all members of the Nigerian banking industry had engaged  the use of Information and Communication Technology  ICT  as a plat- form for efficient conduct of financial transactions. At date, the core ATM  providers are InterSwitch, VPay, ETranzact, and QuickCash. InterSwitch  today has all banks in the country connected to its network. This actually  makes it possible to use their cards in all bank branches nationwide and in  almost all machines. The ATM service providers are also interconnected.  InterSwitch,  for  example,  supports  Verve,  Visa,  and  MasterCard  on  her         332  Mobile Electronic Commerce  ATM machines and vice versa. According to 2010 InterSwitch statistics,  Nigeria has 30 million ATM card holders who conduct over 100 million  transactions on the machines every month. As at second quarter of 2013,  Nigeria’s 24 banks operate over 11,000 ATM machines across the country’s  36 states and Federal Capital Territory.  No doubt, the growing popularity of ATMs has pushed further devel- opment in mobile banking in the country. There is at the moment a func- tional mix between mobile banking and mobile telephone penetration.  As in most parts of Africa and other developing areas, mobile telephone  banking initially started in Nigeria with the SMS  the second most com- mon use of mobile phones, after voice calls  and is expanding through  a combination of Internet protocols enabled by the emergence of smart- phones  and  iPads.  The  dominance  of  the  SMS  channel  is  necessitated  by the fact that majority of the mobile phone devices affordable to most  Nigerians are those that can only perform basic operations. At the moment,  just a little fraction of the population has access to smartphone devices  mostly due to issues relating to acquisition costs and  maintenance. It is a  common knowledge for instance that whereas with less than US$20 one  can buy a mobile handset in the country, the price of an average smart- phone ranges from US$150 to as high as US$500. With the high poverty  rate in the country, it becomes clearer why the basic mobile handsets are  more in use and why the SMS–ATM interface offers huge opportunities  for inclusive banking practice in the country. Interestingly, the linkage  between bank accounts and GSM telephone handsets are more prevalent  among the lower-income class. A study by VISA showed that ATM use  is more common with the individuals within the lower middle-income  classes, suggesting a negative correlation between income size and ATM  usage. According to the results of the study, “the more Nigerians earn,  the less they use their cards for online purchase.”  The situation mentioned notwithstanding, over time, the  flexibility  and the policy support for ATM operations by the Central Bank of Nigeria  have  endeared  more  people  toward  its  acceptability.  This  has  conse- quently led to the expansion in its transactionary usefulness from mere  cash withdrawal and account balance enquiries to cash and check depos- its,  mini-statements  of  accounts,  as  well  as  purchase  of  mobile  phone  recharge airtime and tickets. However, as in the cases of other e-banking  development, the emergence of the mobile phone banking platforms in  the  country  appears  to  have  been  constrained  by  the  consequent  high  level  of  frauds  in  the  system   Ezeoha,  2010 .  Specifically,  the  Nigerian  case is a reflection of how weak institutional and regulatory capacity can  undermine the intensity of e-banking and ICT innovations support eco- nomic growth and development. The rising incidences of mobile banking  frauds, for instance, are argued to be responsible for the underoptimi- zation  of  the  opportunities  created  by  global   e-business  revolution.         Chapter sixteen:  Automated teller machine  333  Rising rate of ATM frauds in the country has equally undermined the  growth  and  expansion  in  the  usage  rate penetration.  Among  the  key  fraudulent  acts  penetrated  through  the  ATM  platform  are  card  theft,  card skimming, pin compromise, card trapping, and transaction rever- sal. Other types or forms of ATM fraud that are permeating the country’s  ATM practice are shoulder surfing, Lebanese Loop, use of stolen cards,  card  jamming,  use  of  fake  cards,  duplicate  ATMs,  and  card  swapping   Adeoti,  2011 .  There  are  also  cases  of  both  operational  distortions  by  banks and system abuses by users of ATM services in the country. The  menace of ATM frauds has, for example, been blamed on the indiscrimi- nate issue of ATM cards by banks without regard to the customer’s lit- eracy level  Obiano, 2009; Adeoti, 2011 . According to Obiano, one of the  frequent causes of fraud is carelessness in the handling of ATM cards by  customers, as well as customers’ response to unsolicited e-mail and text  messages. Power outage is another major challenge facing ATM users in  Nigeria. There are also issues relating to the lack of cooperation among  banks, especially with regard to sharing vital information and data on  ATM usage, operational distortions, and frauds, which makes the curb- ing of fraud very difficult.  The  fact  that  Nigeria  has  a  vast  unbanked  population  with  high  mobile  phone  penetration  signals  a  somewhat  disconnect  in  the  entire  mobile banking arguments. Although the country possesses the potential  to be the leading mobile money market in Africa, that is not the case cur- rently. Barton  2013  reported that there are nearly 110 million mobile sub- scribers in Nigeria but only 56 million people have bank accounts, giving  the market massive growth potential for mobile money services. Based  on the report of the Enhancing Financial Innovation & Access  EFInA ,  an organization committed to deepening financial inclusion in the coun- try,  only  one  in  five  Nigerian  adults  has  a  bank  account   Beshouri  and  Gravråk, 2010 . A CBN 2012 report has it that a total of 39.2 million adult  Nigerians  or 46.3% of the adult population of 84.7 million  were finan- cially excluded in 2012  Central Bank of Nigeria, 2012 . On the average, in  the case of the SSA region, less than 25% of adults reportedly have bank  accounts  Ondiege, 2012 . At the moment, there is a conscious policy effort  by the CBN to encourage financial innovations through the mobile tele- com channel. This policy effort is expected to foster financial inclusion  of  the  unbanked  populace,  especially  among  the  rural  and  urban-poor  population.  The deliberate effort mentioned earlier by the CBN offers some insights  as to why both the pattern and depth of ATM deployment have very much  been induced more by regulatory policies. The CBN, for example, in 2010  issued standards and guidelines for the operations of the ATM services in  Nigeria. The policy document was targeted primarily at guaranteeing the  efficiency of ATM services, and protecting bank customers in the conduct         334  Mobile Electronic Commerce  of ATM operations in Nigeria  Central Bank of Nigeria, 2010 . Among the  key policy issues addressed in the guidelines are ATM technology and  specification standards, ATM deployment  including the ownership, the  licensing, the location, safety, and privacy , the operations, maintenance,  security,  dispute  resolution  process,  and  liability  shifting,  regulatory  monitoring and penalties for default  Central Bank of Nigeria, 2010 .  In the same vein, consequent to the inability of the banks to address  customers’ concerns over safety of and access to ATM terminals, the CBN  issued  a  circular  in  2011  mandating  banks  and  other  financial  institu- tions to adopt appropriate and effective mechanisms to address the spate  of  complaints,  enhance  public  confidence,  and  guarantee  customer  sat- isfaction.  Prior  to  the  circular,  banks  were  widely  accused  of  using  the  ATM facilities to exploit customers, by engaging in acts relating to excess  charges, unauthorized deductions, excess commission on turnover, and  other frivolous charges. February 7, 2011 circular titled “Penalty for Non- Compliance with CBN Circulars and Guidelines on ATM Operations in  Nigeria” was principally aimed at creating the requisite conducive envi- ronment necessary for an efficient ATM system and to make the platform  more attractive to the general public. Among its core provisions was the  spelling out of a number of penalties targeted at mandating banks to facil- itate  ATM  deployment  and  security.  Some  of  such  penalties,  which  are  expected to serve as stringent measures, are     Depositors wishing to withdraw less than N60,000 over the counter  to pay a surcharge of N100, irrespective of the amount, effective July  31, 2008     Increase  in  the  maximum  ATM  withdrawal  limit  from  N4,000  in   2008 to N200,000 as of date     The  imposition  of  a  daily  fine  of  N50,000  on  banks  for  failure  to   establish ATM help desk to address customer complaints     The  imposition  of  a  daily  fine  of  N50,000  on  banks  for  failure  to   respond to customer complaint after 72 h of such compliant     The imposition of a weekly fine of N50,000 on banks for noncompli- ance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, PCIDSS,  until compliance is established     The imposition of a weekly fine of N50,000 for bank’s failure to pro-  vide audit trails and journals for ATM transactions     A refund of ATM surcharge to customers if such surcharge is not   disclosed to the affected customers     The  imposition  of  a  daily  fine  of N50,000  on  banks  for  the  lack  of  online monitoring mechanism and backup power  inverter  for ATM    An ATM without a camera installed to attract a fine of N50,000 and   deactivation of the ATM pending when the camera is installed        Chapter sixteen:  Automated teller machine  335     A fine of N50,000 per day will be applied for the late submission of   returns data on ATM frauds when required     Failure  to  resolve  any  ATM  dispute  with  evidence  of  resolution  within 14 days, the deployer to refund the total amount involved in  the fraud  Another  positive  development  that  is  helping  to  improve  ATM  accep- tance  rate  in  the  country  is  the  scrapping  of N100  interbank  charge  by  the Bankers’ Committee in November 2012. Before then, some banks had  gone  ahead  to  introduce  a  N100  monthly  ATM  card  maintenance  fee,  which did not go down well with the regulatory authority and as such  was abolished in March 2013. An earlier circular referenced BOD DIR  CIR 2009 GEN 10 and dated December 18, 2009 was also issued by the  CBN  directing  all  deposit  money  banks  to  establish  ATM  help  desk  to  handle all consumer complaints. Whereas this latter circular did little in  resolving much of the complaints raised by customers, the CBN in a fol- low-up circular referenced FPR DIR CIR GEN 01 020 dated August 16,  2011 observed some rising pattern in the number of complaints it received  from customers of financial institutions. The complaints ranged from alle- gations of excess charges, unauthorized deductions, excess commission  on turnover, other frivolous charges, and frauds. Ever since, the CBN has  had to embark on sustainable campaign and policy inducements to make  ATM operations more conducive and user-friendly. The overall goal, from  the standpoint of the CBN, is to reform the payment system in the country  through the adoption of e-payment and cashless payment policies.  16.6    Statistical tests of the relationship between  ATM and mobile phone penetration rates  To provide some empirical justifications to the ATM–mobile phone inter- face, we pooled data from 27 African countries over a period from 2004 to  2011 and formulated two alternative estimation equations—an ATM and  a Mobile Phone Penetration Equations. The first equation theorizes that  ATM adoption is dependent on the level of mobile phone, Internet access,  banking development, economic growth, and investments in telecommu- nication. That is,  A TM  =  it  α0 f +    , it  M obilePhone InternetA ccess Banking G row th  ,Investm ents ,  + μ iit  , it  it  it  , it     16.1     The  second  equation  alternatively  theorizes  that  the  level  of  mobile  phone  penetration  is  a  function  of  the  level  ATM  penetration,  Internet         Mobile Electronic Commerce  336     access, banking development, economic growth, and investments in tele- communication, and can be represented as follows:  M obilePhone it  =  α0 f +    A TM , InternetA ccess Banking , it it Investm ents , G row th ,  + μ it iit  it  , it    16.2   Equations  16.1  and  16.2  are  estimated  using  pooled,  fixed-effect,  and  random-effect regression techniques, with a Hausman test for model effi- ciency showing the robustness of the fixed-effect model over the other two.

Some competitive trend also exists among investments in other technology- related infrastructure and electronic banking technology. This is especially  so in Africa, where the infrastructures were not originally there and where  funding difficulties are constraining the development capacity of countries. Consistent with the outcome of the correlation analysis, the regres- sion results shown in Tables 16.3 and 16.4 reveal strong causal relation- ship between ATM and mobile phone. In Table 16.3, which represents the  outcome of the ATM regression equation, mobile phone penetration has  positive and significant impact on ATM penetration in all the estimation  models. In the fixed-effect model, which is found to be more consistent  and  robust,  the  rate  of  Internet  penetration  also  positively  and  signifi- cantly affects ATM penetration.  Results contained in Table 16.4  representing the mobile phone equa- tion  also reveal a corresponding positive and significant impact of ATM  on  mobile  phone  penetration  rate.  Both  Internet  access  and  banking  development have similar positive and significant effect, especially in the  pooled and fixed-effects regression models. In all the equations, there is no         Chapter sixteen:  Automated teller machine  339  empirical evidence confirming any consistent impact of economic growth  and investment in telecommunication in the SSA region. In summary, both  the correlation analysis and the regression results provide a confirmation  of the existence of a strong and systematic interface between the rate of  ATM and mobile phone penetrations in the region. Such empirical out- come is consistent with the theoretical arguments and literature reviewed  in this paper. Although the estimated results are based on panel data, the  conclusion can be country-specific for two reasons—because most of the  SSA countries share similar economic and institutional characteristics.  16.7  Conclusion This chapter reveals the existing literature evidence on the overwhelm- ing  importance  of  increased  mobile  telephone  penetration,  as  well  as  the emerging economic relevance and the influence of mobile electronic  banking,  especially  in  developing  countries.  Mobile  phone  enhances  communication and facilitates business transactions. It provides oppor- tunity  for  linking  customers’  phone  numbers  to  their  individual  bank  accounts  as  a  strategy  for  a  more  flexibly  access  to  banking  services.  Existing  theoretical  evidence  has  also  revealed  how  the  link  between  ATM  and  mobile  phone  can  strongly  enhance  inclusive  banking  in  developing economies. There is not only a consensus, for instance, that  such interface is capable of inducing inclusive banking, efficient financial  practices, and economic growth, but that optimizing the benefits of such  interface is only possible in an environment with minimal incidence of  fraud and technical ineptitude.  This chapter synthetically highlights the theoretical, regulatory, and  empirical sides of the ATM–mobile phone interface debate. It specifically  reviews the developmental and regulatory patterns of both mobile phone  and ATM emergence in Nigeria. It makes use of a panel data from 27 SSA  countries to test the empirical validity of the hypothesis. The outcome con- firms the existence of a strong and systematic interface between the rates  of ATM and mobile phone penetration in the SSA region. It also shows  that the relationship between the two is causal and that both are positively  and significantly influenced by the level of Internet access in each of the  countries. This outcome has important theoretical and policy implications,  especially with regard to the need to ensure that ICT deployment in devel- oping countries is guarded toward realizing the goal of inclusive banking  and efficient financial system. From the issues highlighted in this chapter, it  is also important to note that an efficient ATM–mobile phone interface can  only be attained if the constraining factors, in the likes of the prevalence  of frauds and technical ineptitude, are more systematically addressed. In  Nigeria, as shown in this chapter, a lot of policy and regulatory efforts are  being made by the Central Bank of Nigeria in this direction.        340  Mobile Electronic Commerce  References Abraham,  R.  2007.

On a network standard level, the indus- try evolved through a well-orchestrated multistep transition from global  system for mobile communications  GSM  to general packet radio service   GPRS  and universal mobile telecommunications system  UMTS , which  is  currently  leading  to  the  development  of  4G—the  so-called  long-term  evolution  Barnes, 2002; Li and Whalley, 2002; Ballon, 2004; Ibrus, 2013 .  At the same time, on a service level, the innovation initiative of mobile  network operators  MNOs , device manufacturers  DMs , and a growing   345   346  Mobile Electronic Commerce  set of third parties catalyzed the development of a wide and appealing  offer  of  value-added,  nonvoice  mobile  digital  media  services—which  include handset browsing, mobile social networking, mobile applications,  mobile games, mobile music, mobile video, mobile TV, ringtones, wallpa- pers, and infotainment alerts—pertaining to the so-called mobile content  and applications market segment  Peppard and Rylander, 2006; Kuo and  Yu, 2006; Jung et al., 2013 .  The mobile content and applications market relevance in the overall  mobile telecommunications landscape is rising dramatically, as analysts  expect its global value, only partially hindered by the ongoing recession,  will exceed $140 billion by 2014  Idate, 2012 .  Within  the  global  Mobile  Telecommunications,  Italy  holds  a  key  position, thanks to its world’s highest service penetration and diffusion  rates; its positioning at the forefront in industry innovation at the global  level; and the strong international presence of its key players  Idate, 2012;  Informa, 2012 .  As the market grows and its structure evolves, involving a larger num- ber of heterogeneous firms—characterized by firm-specific activities per- formed—and giving rise to a complex set of relationships between them,  the need of rigorously identifying and consequently analyzing its consti- tutive value-creating or value-destroying activities has emerged, deserv- ing attention from both researchers and practitioners. In particular, given  the complexity of the aforementioned interfirm links and of the resulting  thorough value system structure, the present study claims that the activity  analysis process should benefit from the adoption of a value network per- spective, which extends the traditional value chain model through a refo- cus on interorganizational, nonsequential, and multilayered relationships. Therefore, the study aims at identifying which are the core activities  that constitute the mobile content and applications market, how they are  interrelated, and how they can be internalized and combined by different  market players to define and shape their value domain.  Conceptually,  this  is  achieved  through  applying  the  value  network  and  the  strategic  network  theoretical  frameworks  to  the  Italian  market  for mobile content and applications. Since different activity combinations  within a given key actor’s perimeter may arise, five alternative configu- rations  of  mobile  content  value  networks  are  provided— characterized  by different roles of the involved actors, in terms of activities covered—  representing  the  most  significant  cases  that  emerged  and  could  be  inferred from the information collected through the literature review and  the empirical analysis, based on multiple case studies. As a final step of  the research, coherently to the perspective taken, the proposed configu- rations are evaluated with reference to a set of key variables or drivers  derived from value networks and strategic networks theories, in order to  delineate and compare their different characteristics.        Chapter seventeen:  Mobile content and applications value networks  347  17.2    Literature review on value networks  and strategic networks  Since the renown value chain model was introduced by Michael Porter   1985 , the research stream focusing on the analysis of internal activities  within firms and external relations between them has been to a great extent  chained to the value chain  Normann and Ramirez, 1994 : in the attempt of  individuating and interpreting the performance differentials of firms, the  latter were typically studied as stand-alone, atomistic entities.  In the mobile content and applications market, the view of value cre- ation as a well-defined linear sequence of value-adding activities pushed  the adoption of market strategies which aimed at obtaining a vertical con- trol of the chain: the walled garden solution for mobile portals can be seen  as an example of the application of such approach by MNOs  Peppard and  Rylander, 2006 .  However,  the  applicability  of  the  traditional  value  chain  model  has been questioned by several authors  Hakansson and Snehota, 1989;  Normann and Ramirez, 1994; Anderson, 1995; Gulati, 1995; Campbell and  Wilson, 1996; Tapascott et al., 2000; Stabell and Fjeldstad, 2002; Alle, 2003;  Fjeldstad et al., 2004; Schieffer, 2005; Huemer, 2006; Peppard and Rylander,  2006; Pil and Holweg, 2006 , as it emphasizes the concept of competition  and does not take into fair consideration the more and more complex net- works of both horizontal and vertical relations existing among firms.  Now  that  in  many  industries—including  the  mobile  content  and  applications market—products and services are virtual and the chain of  activities is not any more characterized by a physical dimension, the key  element of a model meant to capture the drivers of value creation cannot  be the mere position held by a firm within the value system but shall be  replaced by the concept of interdependencies on which the whole network  of relationships is built  Huemer, 2006 . Moreover, those interdependen- cies are often far from being linear, and can be structured on several levels  or layers: the sequence of activities constituting the value creation process  is essentially multidirectional—horizontal, vertical, diagonal, retroactive,  parallel, and simultaneous  Pil and Holweg, 2006 .  All the previous types of durable and strategically significant inter- dependencies are embraced by the so-called value network model, which  extends  the  value  chain  model  by  stressing  the  concept  of  network  of  relationships a firm builds within its boundaries—in terms of transversal  processes—and outside its perimeter, and therefore claiming that value is  created through interorganizational streams of activities.  Value networks and strategic networks literature has focused on the  identification  of  variables  or  drivers  capable  of  supporting  a  thorough  description of a network, both from a static point of view—that is, in terms  of its structural characteristics—and from a dynamic one that considers it         348  Mobile Electronic Commerce  as an evolving system subject to both endogenous and exogenous forces  that determine some changes in time  Eggert et al., 2005 .  Taking  from  a  wide  literature  review   Jarrillo,  1988;  Hakansson  and  Snehota, 1989; Burt, 1992; Hinteruber and Levin, 1994; Hobday, 1994; Normann  and  Ramirez,  1994;  Anderson,  1995;  Anderson  et  al.,  1995;  Gulati,  1995;  Campbell and Wilson, 1996; Keil et al., 1997; Parolini, 1999; Gulati et al., 2000;  Tapascott et al., 2000; Li and Whalley, 2002; Stabell and Fjeldstad, 2002; Alle,  2003; Antoniou and Ansoff, 2004; Chiesa and Toletti, 2004; Fjeldstad et al.,  2004; Eggert et al., 2005; Schieffer, 2005; Hagedoorn et al., 2006; Huemer, 2006;  Okamura and Vonortas, 2006; Peppard and Rylander, 2006; Pil and Holweg,  2006; Schoenmakers and Duysters, 2006; Gilsing et al., 2007; Marjolein et al.,  2008; Ahuja et al., 2009; Desarbo et al., 2009; Funk, 2009; Gulati et al., 2009; Lin  et al., 2009 , a set of seven variables to describe a value network were identi- fied. The five key static or structural variables are the following:     Network  focal—It  refers  to  the  firm  positioned  in  the  center  of  the  network,  controlling  the  original  source  of  value,  and  linking  the  peripheral firms.     Critical  network  influences—It  refers  to  the  most  significant  value-  creating relations between firms.     Structural equivalences—It refers to the condition where two or more   members hold a similar position within the network.     Structural holes—It refers to the situation where two or more firms   within a network are connected only through the focal firm.     Revenue streams—It refers to the direct or indirect exchanges of rev-  enues between network members.  Concerning the dynamic variables, the model focuses on entangling the  endogenous  rather  than  the  exogenous  forces—the  latter  being  mainly  related to environmental changes, like the convergence of the IT, telecom- munications, and media industries mentioned earlier  Gulati et al., 2000;  Wirtz, 2001; Li and Whalley, 2002 —and considers two main phenomena:     Lock-in and lock-out effect—It refers to the condition where the estab- lishment of a relation with a given firm sets constraints to the cre- ation of further relations with other firms.     Learning races—It refers to the case where firms involved in a relation  find themselves competing in a race for internalizing the partner’s  assets and resources, before leaving the alliance. This is most likely  to happen when private benefits acquirable by any of the partners  after they have learnt from the other exceed the common benefits of  the alliance  Hamel et al., 1989; Wirtz, 2001 .  These key variables are employed to describe the value network configu- rations proposed later on.        Chapter seventeen:  Mobile content and applications value networks  349  17.3  Research methodology The present research is based on a wide literature analysis on strategic net- works and value network theories, integrated with the adoption of multiple  qualitative interviews as a research method  Rubin and Rubin, 1995; Yin, 2003 . Qualitative  research  methodology  was  chosen  as  particularly  suit- able  for  reaching  the  research  objectives,  which  aim  at  understanding  the  complex  phenomenon  of  value  network  definition  within  a  given  industry—that is, mobile content and applications, and at thus building  new theory—or extending existing theories—on it.  At first, the literature review allowed identifying the variables to be  employed for building the value network models and for assessing their  characteristics in both static and dynamic terms. In addition to this, from  January 2012 to September 2012, 94 qualitative interviews on firms operat- ing in the Italian mobile content and applications market were conducted.  The interview process involved three senior researchers; interviews lasted  1 h 39 min on average.  Consistently with the research methodology employed  Yin, 2003 , the  firm sample was not randomly selected, but firms were selected as they con- formed to the main requirement of the study, while representing both similar- ities and differences considered relevant for the data analysis. Leveraging on  the research carried out by the 2012 Mobile Internet, Content and Applications   MICA   Observatory,  which  has  been  focusing  on  the  Italian  market  for  mobile content since its rise in the early 2000s, the theoretical sample quasi- exhaustively covered the key actor categories belonging to the Italian Mobile  ecosystem. The main categories of the interviewed firms were the following:  MNOs  4 players ; mobile service providers  MSPs   24 players ; mobile content  and applications providers—media companies, web companies; web editors,  developers— 31  players ;  mobile  technology  providers   MTPs    20  players ;  DMs  6 players ; and advertisers  9 players . The sample accounted for 90% of  the universe of actors identified as involved in the market under scrutiny, and  the analysis of secondary sources on the excluded firms allows inferring that  their positioning and perspective was to a great extent similar or totally over- lapped to that of other firms included in the sample—this grants the minimal  loss of information due to the sampling process. Whenever possible, for each  company, the following group of informants was interviewed:     Chief Executive Officer    Chief Information Officer    Mobile content business area manager  this category assumed dif- ferent  denominations  in  different  companies:  the  most  common  were  mobile  content  business  area  manager;  value-added  services  manager; mobile portal manager; and mobile third-parties manager      Product Managers        350  Mobile Electronic Commerce  The semistructured nature of the interviews made it possible to start from  the key issues identified through the literature review  such as the net- work theory’s assessment variables  and also to let any innovative issue  emerge from the open discussion.  The  interview’s  general  scheme  of  analysis  was  built  around  four   investigation building blocks.  At first, each informant was asked to identify the mobile content and  applications  market’s  most  significant  activities  to  be  carried  out,  from  service conception to service delivery. Thanks to this first round of ques- tions, in the subsequent analysis and elaboration phase it was possible to  identify the most significant activities performed to generate value within  the market under scrutiny, thus shaping a generalized mobile content and  applications value network  see Section 1.4 .  Second, informants were asked to describe the role their company cur- rently took on in the mobile content and applications market, in terms of key  activities covered  with questions such as “How would you describe your  company’s core business?” “What are the activities your company performs?”  “Among the activities carried out, where does your company outperforms  competitors, thus grounding its competitive advantage?” . In the analysis and  elaboration phase, this collection of information allowed identifying the span  of activities typically covered by each and every actor; also, it allowed spot- ting any strategic misalignment or uncommon positioning within the same  actor category considered in the sample, to support a cross-case analysis and  feed the value–strategic network scenario generation step of the study.  Third, informants were asked to provide information on the existing  relationships established between their company and other players involved  in the market  with questions such as “What activities directly impacting  on your core business do you outsource or are depending on other actors?”  “What resources and assets, either tangible or intangible, do you share  exchange with your business partners?” “What kind of contractual agree- ments and revenue generation models do you set up with them?” . Data  collected with this round of questions helped in understanding the relative  positioning of different actors in the whole value system, highlighting the  most significant business interrelations and value–strategic network inter- connections; it also helped identifying any coverage overlapping that could  determine competitive attritions between different actor categories.  The  last  investigation  area  dealt  with  the  companies’  future  strate- gies  and  business  plans,  in  terms  of  objectives,  roles,  expected  market  trends,  etc.   with  questions  such  as  “What  are  your  company’s  short– medium  term,  and  long-term  objectives?”  “Where  are  your  strategies  expected to lead your company?” “Are you eager to either strengthen or  modify your current strategic positioning and role, and why?” “Do you  perceive any attempt by other actors—either partners or competitors—to  modify their positioning as well, and how do you interpret their moves?”         Chapter seventeen:  Mobile content and applications value networks  351  “According to your perspective, what are the market’s evolutionary trends  you expect to consolidate in the near future?” . This last set of questions  allowed  integrating  the  analysis  with  a  dynamic  view,  while  making  insightful inferences about the most relevant alternative value–strategic  networks that are disrupting the traditional value system configuration.  A  multiple  case  study  approach  reinforced  the  generalization  of  results  Meredith, 1998  and allowed performing a cross-analysis on the  relevant variables drawn from the literature, to highlight any differential  in terms of their combination—to see which variables changed and which  remained constant going from one value network configuration model to  another—due to the presence of extreme cases, polar types or niche situ- ations within the theoretical sample  Meredith, 1998 . The unit of analysis  for each case study was the firm operating in the market.  As the validity and reliability of case studies rest heavily on the correct- ness of the information provided by the interviewees and can be assured by  using  multiple  sources  or  “looking  at  data  in  multiple  ways”   Eisenhardt,  1989;  Yin,  2003 ,  multiple  sources  of  evidence  or  research  methods  were  employed: direct interviews, analysis of internal documents, study of second- ary sources—research reports, websites, newsletters, white papers, databases,  and  international  conferences  proceedings.  This  combination  of  sources  allowed obtaining data triangulation, essential for assuring rigorous results in  qualitative research  Bonoma, 1985 .  Throughout  the  research,  theory—represented  by  the  literature  review  and  the  original  model  proposed—was  used  as  part  of  an  itera- tive process of data collection and analysis  Eisenhardt, 1989 , meaning that it  was employed as an initial guide to design the study and the process of  data gathering, though it was never intended to constrain emergent issues  coming from the qualitative analysis, so as to preserve the suggested con- siderable degree of openness to the field data  Walsham, 1995; Yin, 2003 .  17.4    Mobile content and applications  value-adding activities  The  market  for  mobile  digital  content  is  undergoing  a  process  of  value  system reconfiguration  Gulati et al., 2000; Li and Whalley, 2002; Stabell  and  Fjeldstad,  2002;  Fjeldstad  et  al.,  2004;  Huemer,  2006;  Peppard  and  Rylander, 2006; Funk, 2009; Ibrus, 2013 .  The overall value network is resulting from the juxtaposition of differ-  ent major value chains  Wirtz, 2001 :     Mobile telecommunications    Information technology    Media    Electronic commerce        352  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Such process is made of a first phase of unbundling, where each value chain  is divided into its elementary activities, followed by a rebundling phase,  where the activities are recombined to create a new structure. The value  configuration  Stabell and Fjeldstad, 2002  coming from the combination of  different activities shall be analyzed in terms of not only length but also  depth: value is created through the vertical interaction of parallel and coex- isting activities located on distinct levels, in what Huemer  2006  defines a  layered architecture made of overcurrent and undercurrent activities.  In the light of the previously mentioned concepts, the mobile content  and  applications  value  system  here  proposed,  related  to  the  process  of  creation, management and delivery of mobile digital content, is composed  of four parallel but interconnected layers:              1. Content  and  Service  Layer,  covering  the  activities  related  to  the  life  cycle management of mobile digital content and services—content  creation,  content  packaging,  content  publishing,  content  manage- ment,  portal  provisioning,  advertising  bundling,  content  delivery  and market making, content charging, content billing and account- ing, and customer relationship management  2. Device Layer, covering the activities related to the design, manufac- turing,  and  delivery  of  devices  for  content  and  service  fruition— device design, device manufacturing, and device provisioning  3. Platform Layer, undercurrent to the previous layer, which comprises  the activities of designing, producing, and operating the middleware  platforms for mobile content management and delivery—platform  design,  platform  manufacturing,  platform  provisioning,  platform  operations, platform management  Firtman, 2013   4. Network Layer, encompassing the cross activities related to the instal-  lation and operations of the mobile network infrastructure  The interconnection between the first two layers becomes evident with the  activity of Content Publishing on the middleware platform. The content  and service layer can be further divided into an upstream chain, encom- passing the activities from content creation to its preparation for delivery,  and a downstream chain considering the stages which follow the content  commercialization  Figure 17.1 .  The identified core value-adding activities can be performed by sev- eral actor typologies belonging to the network: since a different attribution  of activities covered can give rise to alternative network configurations  with specific strategic implications, this study proposes five feasible con- figurations of value networks for the mobile content and applications mar- ket.  Such  models  are  hence  analyzed  and  assessed  on  the  basis  of  key  variables drawn from the existing theories on value networks and strate- gic networks.

The  main  actor  typologies  considered  as  the  market’s  key  player  derive from the integration of the literature review and the empirical data  collection analysis, and include the following seven broad categories:              1. MNO—owns the network and is responsible for the provisioning of   its functionalities.  2. MSP—is mainly active on the overall management of content and  services, taking on an intermediary role between MNOs and mobile  content providers  MCPs .  3. MCP or Developer—concentrates on the creation of digital content,  service, or application. In a broad sense, media–web companies and  single developers also belong to such categories.  4. MTP—focuses on the provision of the content and service delivery   platforms  CSDPs  to manage and deliver digital content.        Mobile Electronic Commerce  354           5. DM—manufactures  and  provides  the  mobile  devices   e.g.,  cellular  phones, smartphones, and personal digital assistants  PDAs   through  which the content, service, or application is accessed by the end user. 6. Advertiser—is  any  kind  of  firm  interested  in  leveraging  on  the   mobile channel to promote their products services. 7. End user—final customer of mobile digital content.  As the different allocation and combination of activities within an actor’s  domain  can  give  rise  to  a  different  overall  value  network,  the  present  research  proposes  five  feasible  noteworthy  configurations,  whose  char- acteristics and strategic implications are further investigated through the  static and dynamic variables derived from the literature review.  17.5.1  Full-walled garden configuration In  the  full-walled  garden  configuration,  the  MNO  represents  the  network  focal, the actor benefiting from a central positioning and a deeper embed- ding within the network structure. In this situation, the MNO takes on a  pervasive role, integrating most of the activities pertaining to the content  and service layer—ranging from content aggregation to content delivery  and  market  making;  it  also  takes  care  of  the  charging–billing–accounting   CBA  process as well as of CRM—in addition to its natural presidium of  the network layer  Whalley and Curwen, 2013 .  The network influences or value ties for the MNO are those built with  MCPs to feed the value added services  VAS  portfolio and with one or  more  MTPs  providing  the  CSDP  through  which  delivering  a  range  of  value-adding functionalities to the end customer—for example, personal- ization, interactivity, context awareness, localization, and so on.  In terms of revenue streams—identified in Figure 17.2 by the arrows  connecting the actors’ domains—the MNO pays out to the CPs either a  content-based or a transport-based fee for original content provisioning,  and receives from them a fee for the exploitation of its proprietary plat- form’s functionalities; it also receives a fee from the advertiser for the ser- vices offered. Being the only responsible for content delivery and market  making,  the  MNO  retains  both  the  content  cost  and  the  transport  cost  billed to the end customers, and pays a share of it to the MTP, who is in  charge of the platform’s operations.  The central position of the MNO creates some structural holes among  actors not directly tied neither between themselves—for example, MTPs  and MCPs, the DMs and the CPs—nor to the end customer: this allows the  operators to benefit from higher profits  Burt, 1992 .  Besides, some structural equivalence can be found, as a single opera- tor can relate with multiple MCPs and advertisers that hold a similar role         Chapter seventeen:  Mobile content and applications value networks  355  End user domain  Usage and transport  fee  Device purchase revenue  Device design  Device manufacturer domain  Advertiser domain   Device managing  Device provisioning  Adv content creation  Branded Device  purchase revenue  Advertising fee  CSDP fee  Content packaging  Content management  Portal provisioning  Advertising bundling  Network operations  Network operator domain  Platform management  CRM  Content delivery and mkt making  Content charging  Content billing and accounting  Content fee  CSDP fee  Content creation  Content provider domain  Content publishing  CSDP fee  Platform design and manufacturing  Technology provider domain  Platform provisioning  Platform operations  Figure 17.2  Full-walled garden configuration.  and somehow find themselves competing for the possibility of establish- ing a strong relationship with the focal firm.  From a dynamic point of view, lock-in and lock-out effects can emerge,  since the contracts stipulated between the MNO and the MCPs for content  provisioning, or between the MNO and the MTPs for platform provision- ing, can be exclusive: these monogamous alliances shape the network struc- ture, and can include or exclude some players from a given network graph  for medium–long periods of time.  As a whole, this full-walled garden configuration is only feasible with  regard  to  elementary  services,  and  does  not  seem  to  meet  the  current  needs  of  the  operators  themselves,  interested  in  developing  the  mobile  content  and  applications  segment  through  leveraging  on  third  parties’  propositions, as shown in Figure 17.3.  This consideration gives rise to a second possible configuration, where   the role of the MSP as an intermediary emerges.  Intermediated content delivery configuration  17.5.2  The intermediated content delivery configuration sees the rise of a further  actor  typology,  the  MSP,  controlling  some  downstream  activities  previ- ously performed by the MNO, like content delivery and market making.         356  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Dynamic assessment ➢  Lock-in and lock-out effects  Relations between: ➢  MTP–MNO ➢  MCP–MNO ➢  DM–MNO ➢  Learning races  ➢    Absent, due to the MNO’s  overcontrolling positioning  Static or structural assessment ➢  Network focal  ➢  MNO  ➢  Critical network influences  ➢  MNO–MTP ➢  MNO–MCP ➢  MNO–DM  ➢  Structural equivalences  ➢  MCP; DM; Advertisers  ➢  Structural holes  ➢  MTP–MCP; MTP–Advertiser ➢  MCP–End User ➢  DM–MCP; DM–TP ➢  DM–End User  for Content Offering   ➢  Revenue streams  ➢  Direct for MNO, DM  for Device Offering  ➢   Indirect for MCP, MTP  Figure 17.3  Full-walled garden configuration: static and dynamic assessment.  Acting as intermediaries, the MSPs establish a direct contact with the end  user, thus enhancing their role and bargaining power within the network. The  MNO  maintains  coverage  of  the  main  upstream  activities,  for  example, content aggregation and management, portal provisioning, and  so on. It also keeps managing the relations with multiple MCPs and one  or more MTPs, adding to this portfolio of alliances the MSPs, from which  it receives a consistent share of revenues coming from the value-added  services commercialization.  The MTPs concentrate within their boundaries the activities belong- ing to the platform layer, and can direct their CSDP offer to both the MNO  and the MSPs. The latter relation can even result in a learning race, where  the Service Provider tries to steal technological resources and competen- cies to internally design and operate the platform.  The DMs keep on being related to the MNO and the end users only,  though the direct revenue streams they receive from the latter are related  to the selling of devices rather than the commercialization of content and  service.  The  focal  actor  remains  the  MNO,  but  as  the  network  structure  becomes less concentrated because of the presence of MSPs, some struc- tural holes characterizing the first configuration are filled—like the one  between MSPs and advertisers, MSPs and MTPs, and MSPs and end users. The  main  structural  equivalences  noted  are  related  to  the  roles  of  MSPs, CPs, and advertisers—such factor increases the level of competition  on the corresponding activities covered—while the most significant net- work influences for the operator in terms of value creation are those with  the MCPs for widening the content and services portfolio, with the MSPs         Chapter seventeen:  Mobile content and applications value networks  357  Content creation  Content provider domain  Content publishing  CSDP fee  Content fee  Device design  Device manufacturer domain  Device provisioning  Device managing Branded device  purchase revenue  Advertiser domain Adv content creation  CSDP fee  Advertising  fee  Content packaging  Content management  Portal provisioning  Network operator domain  Network operations  Content billing and accounting  CRM  CSDP fee  Platform design and manufacturing  Platform provisioning  Technology provider domain  Platform operations  Platform management  Device purchase revenue  End user domain  Transport fee  CSDP fee  CSDP fee  Advertising bundling  Portal provisioning  Service provider domain  Content delivery and mkt making  Content charging  Usage and transport  fee  Figure 17.4  Intermediated content delivery configuration.  to leverage on their assets and resources for better serving a larger pool  of customers and with MTPs providing best-in-class platform solutions  that could influence the content management and delivery performances. Moreover, even in this configuration the peripheral actors could find  themselves  locked  in  or  out  of  an  MNO’s  strategic  group,  with  heavy  impacts  on  their  profitability  and  chances  of  success  or  survival   see  Figure 17.4 .  In sum, this configuration is related to the large majority of content  and  services  published  on-portal   e.g.,  infotainment :  the  MNO  exter- nalizes the downstream activities of content market making to the MSP,  through  a  model  implying  higher  openness  toward  peripheral  actors,  which  paves  the  way  to  a  third  parties–driven  development  of  mobile  content and applications  see Figure 17.5 .  17.5.3  Full open garden configuration The  full  open  garden  configuration  represents  a  possible  development  and  degeneration  of  the  second  alternative,  where  the  Service  Provider  replaces the operator as the network focal, substantially relegating the lat- ter to the role of carrier and network manager.        358  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Dynamic assessment ➢  Lock-in and lock-out effects  Relations between: ➢  MTP–MNO ➢  MCP–MNO ➢  MCP–MNO ➢  DM–MNO ➢  Learning races  ➢    Between MSP–MTP for  technological competencies  Static or structural assessment ➢  Network focal  ➢  MNO  ➢  Critical network influences  ➢   ➢   ➢  MNO–MTP ➢  MNO–MCP ➢  MNO–MSP ➢  MNO–MSP Structural equivalences ➢  MCP; MSP; Advertisers Structural holes ➢  MTP–MCP; MTP–MSP; MTP–Advertisers ➢  MCP–End User ➢    DM–MCP; DM–MTP; DM–End User   for Content Offering   ➢  Revenue streams  ➢  Direct for MNO, MSP, DM  for Device Offering  ➢   Indirect for MCP, MTP  Figure  17.5  Intermediated  content  delivery  configuration:  static  and  dynamic  assessment.  The MSP extends its control to key upstream activities, directly relat- ing to MCPs, MTPs and advertisers as well as to the MNO; in the down- stream section of the content and service layer, the MSP strengthens the  ties bonding it to the end customers.  Concerning revenue streams, the MSP pays a fee to the MCPs for the  exploitation of their content and pays a CSDP fee to the MTPs; it receives  direct  revenues  from  the  advertisers—for  the  enablement  of  their  cam- paigns  on  the  mobile  channel—and  from  the  end  users.  A  consistent  part  of  these  revenues  from  content  commercialization  is  redirected  to  the MNO, for the provisioning of the network infrastructure, of the CBA  system,  of  the  mobile  portal,  and  of  the  customer-related  information.  In fact, in a situation where the MNO holds a secondary role within the  network, it should leverage on its core assets like the infrastructure and  the 3G licenses, the billing and accounting systems, and the control over   customers’ information and usage data  Kuo and Yu, 2006 .  The structurally equivalent firms are now the competing MSPs, MCPs,  DMs, and MTPs. The main structural holes become those separating the  MNO from MCPs and advertisers, while the key network influence for  the MSP is the relation with the operator, which ensures the possibility of  reaching the end customers.  In terms of network dynamics, peripheral firms could be locked in or  locked out of the strategic groups originated by the network’s core dyads  MNO–MSP. Learning races can also arise between MSPs and MCPs, where  the former try to acquire core competencies related to content creation to  become capable of internally developing a white label offer, or between         Chapter seventeen:  Mobile content and applications value networks  359  Device design  Content creation  Device manufacturer domain  Content provider domain  Device managing  Device provisioning  Content publishing  Branded device  purchase revenue  CSDP fee  Content fee  Advertiser domain Adv content creation  Advertising fee  CSDP fee  Content packaging  Content management  Portal provisioning  Advertising bundling  Content delivery and mkt making  Content charging  CRM  Platform management  Service provider domain  Transport fee Billing  fee User mgnt fee  Content billing and accounting  Portal provisioning  Network operator domain  Network operations  CRM  CSDP fee  Usage and transport fee  End user domain  Platform design and manufacturing  CSDP fee  Technology provider domain  Platform provisioning  Platform operations  Figure 17.6  Full open garden configuration.  MSPs and MTPs, where Service Providers could be interested in stealing  the know-how necessary to design and operate a middleware platform to  exploit it for their exclusive benefit, and afterwards breaking the alliance,  shown in Figure 17.6.  The configuration modeled here is surely characterized by a disrup- tive nature, as it takes to the extremes the trend of openness toward third  parties, reshaping the network structure to a point where the substitution  of the MNO as focal firm occurs, shown in Figure 17.7.  17.5.4  Technology and service provider configuration The technology and service provider configuration is alternative to the pre- vious  one,  since  it  sees  the  rise  of  the  MTP  as  the  leading  actor  of  the  network; the MSP is no longer present, as its activities are taken on by  the  technology  vendor.  The  configuration  can  be  labeled  as  disruptive  because it reduces the MNO’s control over the value system and extends  the MTP’s coverage to activities not entangled by its traditional core busi- ness—that is, the activities belonging to the platform layer.  Being the network focal, the MTP directly relates with MCPs, adver- tisers, and end user, as well as to the MNO for exploiting its network  infrastructure  functionalities.  The  MTP  benefits  from  direct  revenue         360  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Dynamic assessment ➢  Lock-in and lock-out effects  Relations between: ➢  MSP–MNO ➢  MSP–MTP ➢  DM–MNO ➢  Learning races  ➢    MSP–MTP for technological  competencies  ➢  MSP–CP for content creation  Static or structural assessment ➢  Network focal  ➢  MSP  ➢  Critical network influences  ➢  MSP–MNO ➢  MSP–MTP ➢  MSP–MCP  ➢  Structural equivalences  ➢  MCP; MTP; Advertisers  ➢  Structural holes  ➢  MNO–CP; MNO–Advertiser ➢  MTP–CP; MTP–Advertiser ➢    DM–MCP; DM–MTP; DM–End User   for Content Offering   ➢  Revenue streams  ➢  Direct for MSP, DM  for Device Offering  ➢   Indirect for MNO, MCP, MTP  Figure 17.7  Full open garden configuration: static and dynamic assessment.  streams  coming  from  the  end  customer,  and  partly  redirects  those  streams to the MNO as a payoff for the transport, CBA, and user man- agement services. For all these reasons, it is evident that the actor incor- porates the activities performed by the MSP, becoming a technology and  service provider.  Within the network originating from the rise of this actor, competi- tive  attrition  manifests  itself  among  the  different  graphs  centered  on  the  dyads  MTP–MNO,  to  which  the  peripheral  firms  are  connected:  the relational space thus created influences the firms’ performances and  behavior.  As it happened in Configuration 3, the network’s structural gaps are  those separating the MNO from the peripheral firms—that is, advertisers  and MCPs. The critical network influence is the relationship between the  MTP and the MNO, essential for the actual deployment of the rich media  content and services to the end user, shown in Figure 17.8.  The shared ownership of end customers between the MTP and the  MNO could even result in a learning race for the internalization of data  and information regarding the user profiles and the usage reports.  As  a  conclusion,  in  the  final  configuration  the  reach  of  the  MTP  is  extended to an overall management of both the mobile digital content and  the  underlying  platforms,  thus  creating  competitive  dynamics  between  the MTP and the MSP that could result in the disappearance of the latter  actor from the value ecosystem. However, the indications coming from the  case studies allow judging such configuration as the least likely to mani- fest on a large scale, since the existing network sections where the MTP is  the deepest embedded firm are mostly resulting from market anomalies—for         Chapter seventeen:  Mobile content and applications value networks  361  Content creation  Content provider domain  Content publishing  CSDP fee  Content fee  Advertiser domain Adv content creation  Advertising  fee  CSDP fee  Platform design and manufacturing  Platform management  Platform provisioning  Platform operations  Technology provider domain  Content management  Content delivery and mkt making  Content charging  Advertising bundling  Transport  fee Billing  fee  Content packaging  Content billing and accounting  Portal provisioning  Network operator domain  Network operations  CRM  Usage and  transport  fee  End user domain  Figure 17.8  Technology and service provider configuration.

Figure 17.9 illustrated and describes the static and dynamic character-  istics of the Technology and service provider configuration.        362  Mobile Electronic Commerce  17.5.5  Device manufacturer–driven configuration The  “DM-driven  configuration  is  quite  a  recent  alternative  related  to  the recent and emerging application store phenomenon  e.g., Apple Store,  Vodafone  360  ,  where  the  DM  leverages  on  the  mobile  device  to  chal- lenge the incumbent’s leadership, bypassing its portal and CBA system   Bergvall-Kåreborn and Howcroft, 2013 .  Within such disruptive alternative, the DM takes on a network focal  role of content and service management, while the MNO withdraws from  direct  content  management  to  some  customer-related  activities,  whose  value is, however, competed away by the presence of DM-owned alter- natives  e.g., CBA provisioning vs. direct billing; Portal Provisioning vs.  Store Provisioning   see Figure 17.10 .  From  a  structural  perspective,  the  configuration’s  critical  network  influences  are  those  among  the  DM  and  MNOs,  and  MCPs  and  MTPs   as the MSP is no longer present in the value network, being replaced by  the  DM  itself ;  the  emerging  structural  equivalences  are  related  to  the  roles of MCP, MSP, and advertisers; the structural holes emerge among  MNOs, MCPs, and advertisers; and the revenue streams are of a direct  nature for DMs  Device Offering and Content Offering , while of an indi- rect one for MNOs, MTPs, and MCPs.

From a dynamic view, lock-in and lock-out effects could be generated  in the relationships between DMs and MNOs and MCPs and MTPs; also,  learning races could rise as DMs and MNOs compete for customer rela- tionship management, or DMs and MTPs compete for technological com- petencies  Figure 17.11 .  17.6  Conclusions and future works The fast-evolving Mobile Content and Applications market results from the  juxtaposition of several value chains; therefore, its value analysis requires  the development of original models extending the existing literature.  The present research focused on the identification of the market’s key  value-adding  activities  and  on  the  further  attribution  of  such  activities  to  the  incumbent  players’  domains:  five  alternative  value  network  con- figurations were hence proposed. The configurations were derived from a  combination of a wide literature review and the case studies performed:  though  hybrid,  in-between  solutions  are  still  plausible,  the  presented  alternatives were selected as the most significant and most likely to arise  in network subparts or graphs.  The findings show how varying the set of value-adding activities  covered by the different actors shapes the network structure and inner  dynamics,  with  significant  impacts  on  the  firms’  behavior  and  stra- tegic options at hand. Specifically, while the first two configurations  are  characterized  by  a  more  conservative  approach,  being  dominated  by the MNO, the third, fourth, and fifth alternatives represent a dis- ruptive  evolution  of  the  current  trend  of  growing  openness  toward  third parties, even resulting in the substitution of the operator as the  network focal.        364  Mobile Electronic Commerce  The paper’s value for researchers can be brought back to the applica- tion  of  the  value  networks  and  strategic  networks  theories  to  a  further  context, where such theories’ core variables are found extremely useful  to describe and assess the market’s feasible configurations, at both a static  and a dynamic level.  Moreover, the study emphasizes the relevance of an Italian national   market in a highly ICT and innovation-intensive industry.  Value for practitioners lies in the creation of a reference model capable  of providing a unified definition of the value-adding activities the market  is structured in, while depicting a set of noteworthy network configura- tions and underpinning the market’s main structural and dynamic char- acteristics as well as their strategic implications.  The study represents a significant contribution to the development  of value network theory, with specific reference to the mobile content  and applications market. Nevertheless, it mainly focuses on the limited,  though relevant Italian national market. Future research will have to  address the issue of the generalization of results, through applying the  same constructs of analysis to different markets and company samples.

Due to  an  increasing  mobility  of  today’s  society  and  progress  in  technological  infrastructure,  the  mobile  phone  technology  has  been  quickly  adopted  worldwide. The technological advances in the field of near-field contact- less communications  NFC  and the development of sophisticated mobile  applications have enabled mobile phones to become a potential means of  payment.  367   368  Mobile Electronic Commerce  From the user’s point of view, the NFC transactions become popular  as they limit the time needed for a user to do a transaction. Conversely,  Alimi et al.  2013  studied the use of NFC transactions for the merchant  side, proposing “different architectures in order to use a mobile phone as  a point of sale.” For security reasons, the users are biometrically authenti- cated through the use of the touch screen on their smart phones.  As  NFC-enabled  mobile  phones,  in  certain  circumstances,  could  be  used as mobile token cloning and skimming platforms  and an attacker  could use an NFC mobile phone as such an attack platform by exploit- ing the existing security control systems , researchers  Francis et al., 2010   paid attention to these aspects as well and developed appropriate security  countermeasures for NFC-enabled phones. On the other hand, legitimate  transaction information from contactless systems could be used for mar- keting research purposes.  Overall, the security issues of the mobile payment services  MPS  are  addressed by many researchers  Lu et al., 2009; Francis et al., 2010; Vesal  and Fathian, 2012 ; however, the biometric approach seems to be dominant. In  2009,  more  than  two-thirds  of  the  population  worldwide  was  equipped with a mobile phone. In developed countries, where the market  for mobile telephony is mature, mobile payments are seen as a potential  source of revenue by mobile operators, who are trying to diversify their  services. In developing countries, where mobile telephony is also widely  adopted, mobile payments are seen by the governments as an opportunity  to improve access to banking services for the unbanked population. The  notion of MPS refers to making payments for goods, services, and bills  authorized that are initiated and realized by using mobile devices inde- pendent from a bank website connection  Schierz et al., 2009 . The mobile  device can either be a mobile phone, a computer, a personal digital assis- tant  PDA , or even a wireless sticker that can be attached to any object,  such as a ring or a key. The transaction can either be remote  SMS-based,  for instance  or be processed locally via contactless technologies such as  near field communication or radio-frequency identification  RFID . Mobile  money  transfers  can  be  remote,  in-store,  prepaid,  or  postpaid  through  reverse billing. Overall, according to a study from Little  2012 , so-called  mobile payments represented a transaction volume of $250 billion in 2012. Based on new technologies, MPS are currently diversifying, even mix- ing them. For example, the mobile traveler’s check  MTC  is a new pay- ment instrument that combines the advantages of e-check  security  and  e-cash  free use . Ahamad et al.  2012  have developed a mobile payment  protocol for MTC, which uses sophisticated algorithms to generate and  verify digital signatures  as elliptic curve digital signature algorithm , and  for encrypting and decrypting the messages suitable for mobile phones.  However, though mobile payments have attracted a lot of attention,  they have so far developed slowly, except in a few countries. While mobile         Chapter eighteen:  Segmenting, targeting, and positioning of mobile  369  services such as “Apps” quickly became part of consumers’ daily lives,  growth rates of MPS remained below general expectations, which resulted  in withdrawals by telecom companies such as O2 Telefonica from their  mobile payment activities. The success of NTT DoCoMo, which launched  a contactless payment solution in Japan, is often cited as prime example  of the potential upheaval that mobile phones can create in the payment  landscape of developed countries. The launch of the M-Pesa service by  Vodafone  in  Kenya,  which  reached  a  total  of  7.5  million  subscribers  in  2009, has also generated hope to reduce financial exclusion in developing  countries  Bourreau and Verdier, 2014 .  As  Venkataraman   2008   shows,  not  all  mobile  payment  implemen- tations  are  successful:  one  of  the  reasons  behind  the  slower  growth  of  m-business is lack of suitable guidance or planning for a successful mobile  payment adoption. Venkataraman addressed this issue—from both tech- nical  and  business  perspectives—by  proposing  a  reference  framework   roadmap  for mobile payment implementation.  From a legal perspective, the issue of liability  such as whether the  payment service user or the payment service provider must bear the finan- cial  consequences—in  case  of  fraudulent  payment  transactions   arises   Steennot, 2011 . Edlund  2011  argues that MPS providers “will probably  take  on  strict  liability  for  executing  payment  instructions,  and  in  some  cases, they will bear the risk of payers’ insolvencies.”  However, a close analysis of these cases reveals that success stories  cannot be easily generalized and demonstrates that several criteria are  needed for mobile payments to succeed  Bourreau and Verdier, 2014 .  In this chapter, the authors will analyze what the main criteria are for  consumers to adopt or reject MPS and how the players involved in the  MPS  market  could  position  themselves  to  gain  revenues  and  market  share.  18.2  Background and problem description  It is important to get away from generic dimensions  and  identify  the  content  of  a  firm’s  specific  theme  in order to focus on those elements and alignments  that are especially important for its situation.  Fuchs et al.  2000, p. 135   This citation is a sound reflection of the challenges the top manage- ment is facing today, more than ever. On the one hand, managers have to  develop and protect the core business of the company, and on the other  hand, they have to explore new products and markets for their company   Kuratko et al., 1990 .        370  Mobile Electronic Commerce  This  balancing  act  poses  an  enormous  challenge  for  the  manag- ers  since  protecting  the  core  business  is  getting  increasingly  diffi- cult in the light of radical technological changes associated with new  competitors.  Entering  new  markets  with  either  established  or  new  products is equally difficult because it means that the managers have  to  cope  with  the  industry  dynamics  that  they  do  not  know  properly,  which  is   significantly  increasing  the  uncertainty  level   Langlois  and  Steinmueller, 2000 .  Nevertheless, most of the companies are obliged to innovate in order  to secure their future  Nelson and Winter, 1977 . Especially in the tele- communications  industry,  the  companies  are  constantly  searching  for  new income streams, meaning that they have to either launch new prod- ucts or develop new markets as mentioned earlier. The rationale behind  this strategy is that their established business models are under enormous  pressure  Ilinitich et al., 1996, 1998 . D’Aveni has coined the word “hyper- competition” to mean a setting of rapidly escalating competition based on  price–quality positioning and competition to create know-how and estab- lish first-mover advantages  D’Aveni, 1994, 1996 .  Especially,  establishing  a  first-mover  advantage  is  very  often  con- sidered  as  the  key  for  new  growth  and  higher  margins   Dos  Santos  and Pfeffers, 1995 . This statement neglects, of course, that a first-mover  advantage  is  a  result  of  a  successful  product  launch  and  not  its  cause.  Only if managers are able to develop and launch an attractive product  aligned  with  defined  segments,  a  company  will  generate  a  first-mover  advantage   Dosi,  1982 .  Providing  a  brief  historical  perspective  on  the  development  of  payment  card  systems  in  developed  countries  can  be  useful to better understand the factors of success and to adopt electronic  payment  systems.  Payment  cards  were  first  introduced  in  the  1950s  by  closed platforms, such as Diners Club or individual banks, which man- aged  to  develop  an  important  acceptation  network  for  their  customers.  Afterward, some banks decided to create interbank joint ventures, which  enabled them to agree on common standards and increase their accep- tation networks. The most important joint ventures, which later became  Visa  1975  and MasterCard  1979 , have a global reach and are now used  and accepted in many different parts of the world. In 2006, these com- panies  transformed  their   organizational  structures  to  become  publicly  traded.  The  example  of  payment  card  systems  shows  that  at  least  two  criteria are essential to the development of electronic payment  systems  for mass market. First, the players must cooperate for the development  of  common  standards  or  specify  the  conditions  for  interoperability.  Building a joint venture can considerably reduce the costs of incompat- ibility  between  different   standards.  However,  the  cooperation  for  the  development of MPS seems to be much more complicated than that for  the development of payment cards. Second, the players must develop an         Chapter eighteen:  Segmenting, targeting, and positioning of mobile  371  important acceptation network. The more the consumers adopt a payment   instrument, the more the merchants will be willing to accept it, and vice  versa. However, one should note that the problems that the players face in  the adoption of MPS are very different from the problems in the diffusion  of payment cards in developed countries. The reasons why mobile pay- ment has not been fully adopted in European countries such as Germany  lie in the payment market itself  TNS Infratest, 2012 :     Paying cash is still the most preferred payment option with over 50%   of consumers.     The  German card market is highly competitive and decentralized   with more than 30 issuers, 16 acquirers, and 8 card processors.     Card penetration is high with 156%, although card payments account   only for 15% of all cashless payments  Dahlberg, 2007 .     Debit  cards  are  the  preferred  card  payment  method   80% ;  credit      Three-fourths  of  all  cards  are  issued  by  public  and  cooperative   card payments are rare  3% .  banks with strong customer ties.  Surveying data from 347 residential cell phone users in Germany, Gerpott  and Kornmeier  2009  found that MPS risk assessments and MPS evalua- tions by social reference groups were important  indirect  determinants of  behavioral intentions concerning future MPS adoption.  In  summary,  the  payment  market  in  Germany  is  competitive  and  decentralized.  Consumers  and  merchants  in  developed  countries  are  already well equipped with payment cards, a widely used and accepted  electronic payment solution. Hence, if they were to replace the use of pay- ment cards, MPS would have to provide sufficient additional value to be  adopted  by  consumers  and  merchants.  On  the  consumer  side,  mobile  phones can potentially have a competitive edge over payment cards, as  they can be used as an interactive device, in which the consumer can store  information. However, consumers are often used to being delivered pay- ment instruments for free, either in a bundle with their bank account or by  merchants who try to increase user stickiness. Hence, if the service is to be  provided by a nonbank, the provider will have to find a way of recouping  its costs of investment in infrastructure and security, which is not neces- sarily eased by the presence of low-cost services. Another option for mobile  payment  service  providers  would  be  to  target  niche  markets,  in  which  payment cards are absent. Such markets could include  person-to-person  money transfers and payment services at a low cost or a low risk for the  unbanked or underbanked. The reasons why some people do not use exist- ing electronic payment instruments are varied; for instance, if a consumer  values privacy, he will not necessarily adopt mobile payments more easily  than payment cards  Bourreau and Verdier, 2014 .        372  Mobile Electronic Commerce  The  only  window  of  opportunity  telecommunications  companies  have to successfully enter payment markets with highly developed infra- structures and a consumer preference for conservative payment methods  is to merge their mobile phone know-how with new payment products in  combination with a new technology. As first retailers and online payment  providers such as PayPal have launched mobile payment, it will become  another established payment alternative for consumers in a few years.  At the heart of the management problem lies the question “how could  the companies involved in the payment market make sure that the newly  launched payment products will be accepted and used by its customers?”  The answer to this question leads ideally to a first-mover advantage for  the provider and subsequently to new and steady income streams.  18.3  Research objective and relevance The objective of this chapter is to suggest strategic management recom- mendations  for  segmenting,  targeting,  and  positioning  MPS  based  on  drivers  and  barriers  of  MPS  adoption  that  were  identified  in  empirical  research related to MPS.  The authors will first give a short review of leading concepts in stra- tegic management theory, that is, competitor-based view  CBV , market- based view  MBV , and resource-based view  RBV , and then provide an  overview and classification of the most important variables that influence  MPS consumer acceptance and adoption as identified in selected empiri- cal research on MPS. The authors will then derive management recom- mendations that follow the principles of the segmenting, targeting, and  positioning  STP  paradigm.  On a theoretical level, the analysis of leading research streams with  regard to their implications of the STP paradigm will lead to new insights  and to a much more different picture on a theoretical dimension.  On an empirical level, the influential variables on MPS adoption as  identified  in  empirical  research  on  MPS  will  be  validated,  leading  to  a  clear picture of what drives or hinders consumer acceptance of MPS.  On a management level, the authors will help managers to structure  and focus their action, especially in the launch of new products in new  markets, leading to better management decisions in the long run.  18.4  Review of strategic management streams In this section, three leading research streams  views  will be reviewed  and  critically  analyzed,  namely,  the  RBV,  the  CBV,  and  the  MBV.  The  rationale behind this approach is twofold. On one side, the general theo- retical baseline has to be settled, and on the other side, the STP Paradigm  has to be theoretically rooted. The common denominator of all views is         Chapter eighteen:  Segmenting, targeting, and positioning of mobile  373  the search and or explanation of a sustainable competitive advantage a  company  should  strive  for  in  order  to  be  successful  in  its  market.  The  core  question  underlying  this  chapter  is,  what  are  the  implications  of  each  view  with  regards  to  the  launch  of  a  new  payment  product  and  has each of the reviewed views potential to theoretically enrich the STP  paradigm?  Deriving from the structure–conduct–performance hypothesis  Bain,  1968 ,  which  implies  that  the  industry  setting   structure   is  the  main  driver for the strategic actions  conduct  of the company and thus for the  profitability of the company  performance , Porter developed the CBV, fea- turing his famous five forces model  Porter, 1980, 1981 . The aim of this  model  is  to  firstly  identify  the  competitive  forces  within  the  industry,  which are responsible for its attractiveness. Second, normative actions can  be derived from the model as to how the top management can influence  the industry structure in its favor  Porter, 1985, 1987 . According to Porter’s  logic, an industry has high and stable profits  and is thus very attractive   when the companies within the industry are able to repel the threat of  new entrants, avoid the threat of new substitute products, neutralize the  bargaining power of its suppliers, and keep the rivalry among the com- petitors low. Consequently, the incumbents of the industry have to work  on these dimensions in order to keep profits in the industry high  Porter,  1980, 1981, 1985, 1987 .  The following comment is a critical extract concerning the logic of the   model:  The central tenet of this paradigm, as summarized  by Porter is that a firm’s performance is primarily  a  function  of  the  industry  environment  in  which  it  competes,  and  because  structure  determines  conduct   or  conduct  is  simply  a  reflection  of  the  industry  environment ,  which  in  turn  determines  performance,  conduct  can  be  ignored  and  perfor- mance can, therefore, be explained by structure.   Hoskisson et al.  1999, p. 425   Despite criticism, the five forces model has become one of the most  popular and applied strategic management tools due its simplicity and its  broad application spectrum  Cockburn et al., 2000 .  A  refinement  within  the  industrial  organization  body  of  thought  is  the strategic group concept  Brush et al., 1999 . Within the strategic group   concept, above-average profits are traced back to mobility barriers like econ- omies of scale and scope or product differentiations within the  equivalent  strategic group or cluster. The strategic implication for the top management  is that it should rather focus on strengthening mobility barriers, for instance,         374  Mobile Electronic Commerce  by clever product differentiations, within their strategic groups rather than  being focused on overall industry structure as such since this level of analy- sis is not detailed enough to derive successful strategic action  Hatten and  Schendel, 1977 . The implication that companies should rather take action  on a strategic group level than on an industry level has been amplified by  studies such as the one completed by Cool and Schendel  1987 . Researchers  come to the conclusion that the profitability of companies can be primarily  traced down to the competition within the strategic group, meaning that  a very high level within the strategic group spoils company profits, rather  than intense rivalry on the industry level  Cool and Schendel, 1987 . So far,  the industry level and the strategic group level have been taken account  within the CBV. In markets characterized by hypercompetition  D’Aveni,  1994 and 1996  such as the mobile  telecommunications, former rivals may  be forced to team up in order to increase their user basis. Coopetition is a  business strategy based on a combination of cooperation and competition,  derived from an understanding that business competitors can benefit when  they  work  together   Brandenburger  and  Nalebuff,  1996 .  The  coopetition  business model is based on games theory, a scientific approach  developed  during the Second World War  to understanding various strategies and out- comes through specifically designed games. Traditional business philoso- phy translates to games theory’s zero-sum game in which the winner takes  all and the loser is left empty-handed; proponents of coopetition claim that  it can lead to a plus-sum game, in which the sum of what is gained by all  players is greater than the combined sum of what the players entered the  game with. It starts out with a diagramming process called the value net,  which is represented as a diamond shape, with four defined player designa- tions at the corners: customers, suppliers,  competitors, and complementors.  Complementors are defined as players whose product adds value to yours,  for  example,  the  way  software  products  gain  value  because  hardware  products coexist with them, and vice versa. In comparison, a competitor  is defined as someone whose product makes your product less valued,  for  example, the way a new toothpaste brand entering the market would make  the brand that had previously been the only brand on the market become  less valued. The game of business is then broken down into its parts   players,  added values, rules, tactics, and scope  as a means of viewing practices and  strategies. Added values focus on ways to improve products and services to  find ways of making more money from an existing customer base. Rules  specify ways of attracting customers with strategies such as price matching.  Tactics are the practices sometimes used to take away a competitor’s likely  market share, for example, announcing an upcoming  and possibly nonex- istent  new and improved product when a competitor’s product is released.  Scope, which is the final part, is used to take a broader prospective and cre- ate links between competitor’s games and interests and see how coopetition  can benefit the players  Brandenburger and Nelebuff, 1996; Rouse, 2005 .        Chapter eighteen:  Segmenting, targeting, and positioning of mobile  375   …  we know much less about how barriers to entry  are built: about why this firm and not that one devel- oped the competencies that underlie advantage, and  about  the  dynamic  process  of  which  competitive  advantage first arises and then erodes over time.  Cockburn et al.  2000, p. 1123   In  its  early  phase,  the  RBV  was  primarily  a  reflex  of  the  dominant  thinking  of  the  industrial  organisation   I O   research  stream,  which  manifested  itself  in  the  CBV  analyzed  in  the  last  chapter   Wernerfelt,  1984; Barney, 1991 . Leading researchers  Dierickx and Cool, 1989; Collis,  1991a,b;  Conner,  1991;  Castanias  and  Helfat,  1991   criticized  the  one- sided  focus  on  the  industry strategic  group  level  and  the  ignorance  of  the resources  managerial, financial, etc.  and processes on the firm level.  Today,  it  is  widely  accepted  that  the  RBV  and  the  CBV  do  complement  each other since the CBV is focused on external factors such as the indus- try  and  strategic  groups  whereas  the  RBV  focal  points  are  the  internal  factors  of  the  company   Rasche,  2000 .  Over  the  last  years,  three  crite- ria,  namely,  nonimitability,  lock-in,  and  nonsubstitutability,  to  describe  successful  resources  have  been  established  in  the  research  community.  Before describing shortly these criteria it has to be remarked that it is an  idealized concept, as Montgomery  1995, p. 257  rightly points out:  Like a Platonic Ideal, this characterization of a per- fect  form  of  resources  is  very  useful  from  both  a  theoretical and a practical standpoint. At the same  time, it is important to know something about the  size of the gap between the idealized version of a  form and what is seen on reality. This is where the  resource-based literature falls dangerously short.  Nonimitability refers to the notion that the resources the competitive  advantage of a company rests upon are nonimitable. This means the less  a resource can be imitated copied by the competitors, the more valuable  the resource is for the company  Rouse and Daellenbach, 1999 . On a theo- retical level, this argument is supported by the theory of contestability of  markets, which means that companies can protect themselves from their  competitors by large irreversible investments in order to discourage them   Schmalensee and Willig, 1989 .  Lock-in refers to the fact that there is a strong relation between how  deeply ingrained  embedded  the resources are in the company and its  success. In other words, when the resources are deeply ingrained in the  corporate culture, they become in return enormously nontransparent for  the competitors, which in turn makes it very difficult for them to reap         376  Mobile Electronic Commerce  the  key  resources  to  weaken  the  competitive  advantage  significantly   Peteraf, 1993 . Since the top management know what resources are key  or not, they have to find ways to embed them as deeply as possible in the  corporate culture  Peteraf, 1990; Peteraf and Shanley, 1997 .  Nonsubstitutability is, in comparison to the first two criteria, the most  questionable  since  “the  threat  of  substitution  is  omnipresent…”   Collis,  1991a, p. 7 . Collis rightly refers, in his quotation, to the certainty that sub- stitution in today’s highly technical world is ever present and very hard  to  assess  since  normally  substitution  comes  along  with  a  new  technol- ogy.  Especially,  the  incumbents  regularly  underestimate  the  dynamics.  For instance, it is, interesting to note that in the emerging mobile payment  industry, the banks are not playing a key role but rather companies like  Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone, which come from outside the industry  but do have the technological access.  “ …   Causal  ambiguity  exists  when  the  link  between  the  resources  controlled by a firm and a firm`s sustained competitive advantage is not  understood  or  understood  only  very  imperfectly”   Barney,  1991 .  The  causal ambiguity concept plays a pivotal role within the RBV. It refers to  the notion that very often the relationship between the resources and the  competitive position the company has is blurred. It means that a certain  part of the success of the company cannot be explained. A good example  is the success of Apple. If a researcher is asked to explain the success of  Apple, the answers vary from the personality of its founder, Steve Jobs,  to the design of its products until its distribution strategy through iTunes  and  the  Apple  Stores.  The  core  argument  behind  the  causal  ambiguity  concept is that the less known the relationship between the resources of  the company and its competitive advantage, the higher the imitation hur- dles of its competitors:  When  advantage  is  based  on  competencies  that  have causally ambiguous characteristics then it will  be difficult for companies to overcome the advan- tages by imitation. In itself causal ambiguity does  not guarantee that a firm will be able to maintain a  competitive advantage, but does create a very effec- tive barrier to imitation.  Reed and DeFillippi  1990, p. 94   Critics like Collis rightly point out that if a company does not know  exactly what it does right  meaning what their competitive advantage rest  upon ,  any  action  undertaken  is  as  likely  to  strengthen  its  competitive  advantage as it is to destroy it  Collis, 1991a, p. 11 .  Of all the views analyzed so far, the MBV plays a pivotal role in the  launch of a new payment product, as it will be seen. As the name of this         Chapter eighteen:  Segmenting, targeting, and positioning of mobile  377  Core logic of the MBV  Consumers  +  Product marketing  managers  Can articulate precisely their wants and needs Know exactly what product features are important for them  Understand the consumer Can translate the wants and needs of the consumers into corresponding product criteria  Articulation  Translation  Successful product  Figure 18.1  Logic of the MBV.  view already implies, the market-based considerations are at its core, and  it  thus  corresponds  highly  with  the  marketing  concept.  The  rationale  behind the MBV is that—based on an intelligent definition of the relevant  market—attractive market segment will be identified, which in turn will  be secured and developed by an adequate positioning strategy  segment- ing  →  targeting  →  positioning    Kotler,  1989,  1997 .  The  overall  aim  is  to  position  products  and  services  as  idiosyncratic  as  possible  from  the  consumer perspective to ideally realize a strong position in the market   Abell, 1980, 1999 . The underlying hypothesis of this research stream is  that the consumers know the preferred product specifications very well  and are on top of that in the position to articulate them accordingly  Day,  1990  so that the product and marketing managers are able to develop the  corresponding product. Figure 18.1 describes this core logic.  18.5    Preconditions, drivers, and barriers of mobile  payment services’ consumer acceptance  MPS is a dynamic and growing market segment, regarded as a strategic  business field  Bauer, 2012 , and thus, potential providers and retailers aim  for a competitive advantage if they start offering MPS to their consumers.  The main providers are PayPal, Google, Square, and Vodafone. The over- all aim is to position the services from the consumer perspective to ideally  realize a strong position in the market  Abell, 1980, 1999  as reflected in the  MBV. With this logic, the value proposition of a product is a result of how  an innovation is accepted by consumers in comparison to products from  competitors  Day and Montgomery, 1999 .  Pousttchi and Hufenbach  2013  propose a mobile payment reference  model  that  provides  not  only  theory  background  but  is  also  a  tool  for  marketing  research—to  be  used  for  data  collection  and  customer  pref- erences analysis. “Discovering preferences transparently means that the  marketer  learns  the  customer  needs  without  actually  involving  them.         378  Mobile Electronic Commerce  When marketers learn customer preferences collaboratively, they engage  in a dialogue to help customers to articulate their needs and identify how  to meet those needs”  Kahn, 2000, p. 14 .  The most established procedure of MPS is the premium rate SMS,  whose  costs  are  higher  than  the  regular  SMS  and  is  used  not  only  for  the  purchase  of  certain  ringtones  and  logos  but  also  for  parking  fees  and  purchase  of  fast-moving  consumer  goods  in  selected  super- market  chains  limited  to  €25.  Because  these  MPS  can  be  used  with  a  simple  mobile  phone,  it  is  a  common  payment  method  in  Africa  and  India. A payment option that requires a smart phone is to pay mobile  via  Apps,  which  is,  for  instance,  a  benefit  of  Starbucks  coffee  shops.  Another option to pay for the owners of smart phones with integrated  NFC  chip  is  to  just  hold  the  mobile  device  against  an  NFC  terminal,  installed  at  point  of  sale   POS ,  and  the  transaction  occurs  automati- cally for registered customers. This technology has been established in  Asia since 2004, while the merchant adoption rate in Western Europe is  still low. However, first attempts in this direction have been made by  public transport in the underground and bus stations or ticket offices of  car parking. What still lacks is the trust of consumers and merchants,  leading  to  hesitation  in  their  adopting  this  different  way  of  payment   Kreimer and Rodenkirchen, 2010 .  With the aim to identify the drivers and barriers of MPS consumer  acceptance and adoption, the author selected empirical explorations, each  with a different focus, but all contributing unique insights. Tornatzky and  Klein’s meta study on innovation adoption  1982  provides a fundamental  understanding of influential variables of the intention to use innovations  in general.  The study by Schierz et al.  2009  explored acceptance determinants of  MPS. Mallat  2006  identified MPS drivers and barriers of consumer adop- tion and, together with Tuunainen  Mallat and Tuunainen, 2008 , barriers  of merchant adoption. Yang et al.’s  2012  exploration from China is not  limited to the intention to use but includes results from the postadoption  stage of MPS usage. Research results of consumer acceptance in e-com- merce  Pavlou, 2003  and m-commerce  San-Martin and Lopez-Catalan,  2012; also see Bauer, 2012  have been incorporated to examine the role of  trust for adoption. The samples are heterogeneous concerning age, gen- der, and educational and professional background.  Bamasak  2011  shows that Saudi Arabians expressed willingness to  accept MPS; however, the security of mobile payment transactions and the  unauthorized use of mobile phones to make a payment are great concerns.  In this respect, some authors  Daskapan et al., 2010  favor short-range MPS  as more trustworthy.  In their survey on potential MPS users in Asian rapidly expanding  market,  Liu  et  al.   2011   have  identified  five  mobile  payment  interface         Chapter eighteen:  Segmenting, targeting, and positioning of mobile  379  usability factors  content, ease of use, promotion, made-for-the-medium,  and emotion  that have a positive influence on interaction behavior and  intention to use mobile payment.  The  authors  restructured  the  variables  that  are  driving  MPS  acceptance and adoption, according to empirical research, into the fol- lowing:  1   preconditional drivers of the intention to use MPS,  2  influ- ence factors of the intention to use MPS, and  3  drivers of actual MPS  usage. The variables that hinder MPS adoption are summed up under  barriers in Number 4  Wurster, 2013 .                                     1. Preconditional drivers of acceptance and of the intention to use MPS    Wurster, 2013  are as follows: a.  Trust  in  the  system  and  the  provider s    Pavlou,  2002;  Mallat,  2006; Mallat and Tuunainen, 2009; Bauer 2012; San-Martin and  Lopez-Catalan, 2012; Fingerhut, 2014   b.  Compatibility of the system  Tornatzky and Klein, 1982; Mallat,   2006   c.  Accessibility to the system  Wurster, 2013; Fingerhut, 2014   2. Following  factors  can  influence  the  intention  to  use  MPS,  but  are  depending  on  the  consumer’s  character  and  social  background  or  lifestyle and thus cannot be categorized as general drivers according  to Wurster  2013 : a.  Social influence of the consumer’s peer group or social network  community  Tornatzky and Klein, 1982; Schierz et al., 2009; Yang  et al., 2012   b.  Positive  attitude  toward  innovations  and  individual  mobility    Schierz et al., 2009   et al., 2012   c.  Subjective  norms  as  personal  risk  or  control  perception   Yang   3. The  providers  can  drive  the  MPS  adoption  rate  and  the  actual  usage by offering more convenience than alternative payment options   Wurster, 2013  or “value-added  services”  Fingerhut, 2014 , meaning  that providers should extend their offers in order to be distinctive vs.  card payments  Fingerhut, 2014   4. Barriers of MPS consumer adoption, in the author’s opinion are as   follows: a.  The  absence  of  trust  in  the  security  dimensions  of  a  payment  system.  Most  authors  and  researchers  agree  upon  the  domi- nant role of security issues in the acceptance of online and MPS   Pavlou 2003; Bauer, 2012; Wurster, 2013; Fingerhut, 2014 .  b.  Complexity  as  the  opposite  of  convenience   or  simplicity ,  but  in the sense of too many different and long lasting registration  procedures. If all providers would agree on the same and most  simple technology and would follow the touch-and-go logic that         380     Mobile Electronic Commerce  enables transparent procedures and control the money transfer,  consumers’ fear and risk perceptions would decrease  Ondrus  and Pigneur, 2009; GfK, 2011; Wurster, 2013 .  c.  All factors that hinder merchants to adopt mobile payment sys- tems and thus, prevent from making the services accessible for  the consumer  see Mallat and Tuunainen, 2008 for the barriers of  merchant adoption .  18.6    Strategic management options for segmenting,  targeting, and positioning MPS  For strategically positioning a product as MPS, the authors chose the STP  paradigm as it plays a central role in the MBV and the strategic manage- ment stream, which is focusing on consumer needs and acceptance within  a certain competitive surrounding. The flow displayed in Figure 18.2 sum- marizes the overall framework.  The  ground-laying  logic  of  market  segmentation  is  based  on  the  notion that customers demonstrate heterogeneity in product preferences  and buying behavior  Green, 1977; Wind, 1978 . This should also be the  starting  point  of  the  strategic  recommendations  to  launch  a  new  MPS  product.

Chapter eighteen:  Segmenting, targeting, and positioning of mobile  381  18.6.1  Segmenting the market properly For this paper, the definition of market segmentation is adopted from the  American Association of Marketing, which states that “market segmenta- tion is concerned with classification of customers and consumption and  when  enacted,  market  segmentation  usually  turns  to  or  is  based  upon  the relationships, which follows”  American Marketing Association, 2014 .  This definition can be complemented with the following: “it’s a creative  and iterative process, the process of which is to satisfy customer needs  more closely and, in doing so deliver sustainable competitive advantage  for the company”  MacDonald and Dunbar, 2012 .  In  this  case,  the  proven  influence  of  social  networks  can  support  marketers. If marketers incorporate innovators and early adopters such as  cocreators  Kotler et al., 2010  of their services constantly interact with their  consumers on platforms such as Facebook and use word-of-mouth commu- nication, they can transport the right benefits, meaning the benefits that  are relevant for consumers.  The idea of strategic window such as the outcome of the market seg- mentation efforts, which takes the discussion to a strategic and tactical  level, gives companies the opportunity to increase their profits and allow  them as new competitors to challenge and attack traditional market lead- ers   Abell,  1978 .  However,  this  strategic  window  is  reduced  to  limited  periods when key requirements of a market and particular competencies  of a company competing in the market are at an optimum  Proctor, 2000 .  On the tactical side, this means until competitors copy a firm’s segmen- tation routine, the firm has a competitive edge; if the product or service  is specific to the segment, then this competitive advantage is multiplied   McBurnie and Clutterbuck, 1988 .  Although segmenting is perceived on a theoretical level as an objective  and straightforward activity, one has to understand that there is an array  of issues and challenges when it comes to successfully implementing the  identified and selected segments. Indeed many concepts and approaches  do exist to segment a market, but when it comes to identifying the key cri- teria like measurability, accessibility, the strength of the segment as such,  and last but not the least the noninterference within segments, especially  in terms of buying behavior, the scope of differentiating variables are con- siderably reduced. The identification and selection of differentiating vari- ables is further complicated as consumers’ preferences keep on changing  at  a  much  faster  rate  and  the  their  behavior  is  increasingly  difficult  to  predict since it is getting more and more hybrid, meaning that consum- ers  cannot  be  associated  with  one  segment  but  rather  with  many.  As  a  result  of  fast-changing  markets  and  consumer  behavior,  which  is  enor- mously difficult to predict, noninterference within different segments can  be hardly granted, which in turn questions the overall segmentation of         382  Mobile Electronic Commerce  the company. Due to the increased turbulence of the environment, com- panies  are  literally  forced  to  question  themselves  in  terms  of  their  key  target segments: Are our segments properly aligned with our strategy or  are they contrary? Since the consumer behavior does not take into account  artificial segments that were made up by the company in order to follow a  predefined strategy.  There are varieties of research on dividing the mobile communication  market into different target groups. Yang et al.  2012  suggest segmenting  potential users according to their personal traits, especially to the degree  of their predisposition to adopting innovations and to the degree of their  individual mobility  Yang et al., 2012 .  Schierz et al.  2009  found that it is crucial to identify the early adopt- ers of MPS as they are likely to adopt innovations first. The positive influ- ence of the early adopters has already been discussed in the Innovation  Diffusion Theory  IDT  construct  Rogers, 1983 .  Nearly  every  adult  owns  a  mobile  phone  and  carries  it  with  him;  two-thirds  of  the  1000  test  persons  in  the  KPMG  study   Kreimer  and  Rodenkirchen,  2010   have  access  to  the  Internet  on  their  mobile  phone.  However, this would imply to be owner of a smart phone, which accounts  only for 25% of the worldwide population and approximately 40% of the  German  population.  Those  who  possess  a  smart  phone  and  go  online  with their mobile phone on a daily basis are much more likely to use MPS  in the future than those whose use the Internet less frequently  Kreimer  and Rodenkirchen, 2010 .  Therefore, a valid segmentation option would be to take the mobile  Internet  usage  behavior  of  consumers  as  a  basis,  as,  for  instance,  done  in the mobile communication report 2013  MCR, 2013  valid for Austria.  Although Austria is a small country, its location between east and west  Europe  is  ideal  to  integrate  insights  from  both  western  and  eastern  European consumers. The MCR research revealed three target groups: the  digital immigrants  52% , digital natives  36% , and digital outsiders  12% . The digital immigrant include a wide age range and are regular users  of mobile web services  76% usage rate , but their usage is selective and  goal oriented. Their hesitation is grounded in security and data protection  issues they have with web services  Klaus Oberdecker, CEO Mind Take  Research in: MCR, 2013 . Their education level and income are the highest  of all three target groups.  Consumers  who  cannot  resist  their  addiction  to  the  mobile  phone  belong to the digital natives; they are brought up with mobile phones and  the Internet and account for 36% of the sample. Their usage rate of mobile  web services is 96%. For these people, the mobile phone is essential for  their  communication.  The  digital  outsiders  are  the  ones  with  most  skep- ticism.  Their  mobile  Internet  usage  rate  is  only  at  8%;  34%  of  them  are  older than 50 years, and the majority of them  81%  have only discovered         Chapter eighteen:  Segmenting, targeting, and positioning of mobile  383  the web during the last 2 years. The majority of the digital outsiders reject  using the mobile phone for any communication activities other than to  make calls because the display seems too small for them, which reduces  convenience, and they are technically too poorly skilled to go online with  their phone, even if it is a smart phone  MCR, 2013 .  Gender segmentation or segmentation according to the individual risk  disposition of consumers would be an additional feasible segmentation  strategy for MPS, which would imply to divide potential users into risk- averse  and  risk-friendly  users  and  targeting  them  individually,  follow- ing Mallat’s argumentation  2006 . Especially in payments, MPS providers  need to make sure to increase transparency in information for those users  who are risk-averse with special programs individually targeted to them  with the aim to make them overcome their fears.  18.6.2  Targeting the right consumers Generally,  the  literature  embraces  under  the  term  “targeting”  the  com- plete  target  management  of  the  marketing  department   Kahn,  2000 ,  Closely  connected  with  the  overall  target  management  are  two  funda- mental questions:        for improvement?  1. Do we realize the full potential of our target groups or is there room   2. How can we identify new target groups based on our segment anal-  ysis and then access their attractive potential accordingly?  Especially the second question is one of the main drivers behind the activ- ities of a provider in the mobile payment market since the top manage- ment wants to access this attractive market.  Most researchers from empirical research in Chapter 5  e.g., Mallat,  2006; Mallat and Tuunainen, 2008; Schierz et al. 2009; Yang et al., 2012  sug- gested that companies should specifically target and position their MPS  solutions to well suit individual behavioral patterns and prior experience. The positive influence of innovators and early adopters on the intention  to use MPS has already been stated. Targeting MPS to them and using  them as multiplier for more skeptical consumer groups would probably  enable to conquer the mass-market faster.  However,  management  implication  is  to  expand  the  user  base  and  their  sources  of  revenue  by  leveraging  the  effect  of  social  influences.  Eighty-eight percentage use the mobile phone to gather information about  products and services and their benefits or to search for certain brands  and offers. Men  78%  and consumers younger than 30 years  89%  are the  heavy users of mobile web services. A refined segmentation revealed that  the digital natives and the digital immigrants could become the most relevant         384  Mobile Electronic Commerce  target groups for strategic marketing activities in MPS as they account for  88%  of  the  users   MCR,  2013 ,  as  described  in  Section  1.6.1.  The  reason  for the high attractiveness of these consumers is that they go online on a  daily basis and rather have trust in mobile payments than those who go  online less frequently. But also among the frequent Internet users, 30% of  mobile shoppers think that payments in mobile commerce are not secure  enough. For 19%, the purchase is still too complicated, and for 13%, the  payment process is not convenient enough. Fifty-six percentage that have  downloaded an App from the App Store pay attention to which features  the App has possibly access on  MCR, 2013 .  One  possibility  to  considerably  increase  the  efficiency  of  targeting  activities is the implementation and deployment of Customer Relationship  Software tools since one of the central values these systems have for com- panies is that all customer data are centralized and that new target groups  can be much more easily identified when customer behavior patterns are  at the basis of the analysis  Sheth and Sisodia, 1999 .  18.6.3  Managing competition Ideally, the  competitive  positioning of a company is the result of success- ful STP activities.  If  companies  want  to  be  successful,  the  top  management  has  to  firstly make sure that all relevant resources are in place and that there  is no shortage. Second, it has to identify the key resources  i.e., technical  features, etc. , which are very likely to be crucial for the market success.  Last but not the least, the management has to make sure that know-how  will be shared and embedded within the mobile payment unit and that  the  key  resources   if  it  is  possible  to  identify  them   will  be  locked-in  accordingly.  But as for companies that would like to participate in the emerging  mobile payment market, it is vital to constantly track market facts such as  the technology development of the existing products, platforms, and ser- vices of competitors such as Google Wallet or PayPass and all competitive  activities of major players such as PayPal in this dynamic market envi- ronment.  A  solid  theoretical  understanding  of  possible  strategic  paths  and learning from competitive activities, including online banking and  e-commerce,  would  support  protagonists  who  aim  at  gaining  or  main- taining competitive advantages in this field.  With regard to the launch of a new payment product, the CBV gives  fruitful theoretical insights and normative recommendations on all three  levels. It is key, for instance, not to overestimate the industry level; just  because an industry like mobile payment is attractive, it does not mean  that a company in the industry will be able to reap its potential profits.  On  the  strategic  group  level,  the  management  has  to  focus  on  raising         Chapter eighteen:  Segmenting, targeting, and positioning of mobile  385  mobility barriers in order to keep out potential competitors. In the light  of enormous technology progress over the last years, this will be very dif- ficult to realize.  According  to  leading  researchers   Karnani  and  Wernerfelt,  1985;  Barnett, 1993; Barnett et al., 1994; Grimm and Smith, 1997 , strategies taken  by one company have knock-on effects on the strategies and the actions  taken  by  its  rivals   Gimeno  and  Woo,  1999 .  The  most  promising  level  for big players in the mobile payment market is to derive their strategic  actions from the action–reaction level of its main competitors. Two factors  are responsible for the level of amplitude concerning the action–reaction  pattern: interfirm rivalry and the assessment of the action–reaction. This  means that the higher the interfirm rivalry is and the stronger the reac- tion of the main rivals is assessed, the more prudent and thoughtful the  management will be to launch strategic attacks. Thus the action–reaction  pattern on the firm level is the core element of the concept of competitive  dynamics. A consequence of it can be to follow the strategy of coopeti- tion  Brandenburger and Nalebuff, 1996 . Benefits of these cooperations  between  competitors  are  cost-sharing  and  taking  advantage  of  comple- mentarities  between  different  players.  Banks  have  gained  a  great  deal  of experience in operating mass-market payment systems, which might  be critical for a wide adoption of a mobile payment solution. They also  have  experience  in  risk  and  fraud  management  that  other  players,  like  providers,  do  not  have.  In  contrast,  providers  have  strong  partnerships  with mobile phone manufacturers, which might help to develop payment- enabled mobile handsets. Costs of cooperation are twofold. First, partners  will have to share not only costs but also revenues. For instance, in case of  cooperation between banks and providers, if mobile payment adds little  value relative to existing payment solutions  e.g., payments by card , this  may impede the constitution of a partnership. Second, like in any joint  venture, there are costs of coordination. As they have different objectives  and interests for the development of mobile payments, one could assume  that  the  costs  of  cooperation  between  banks  and  providers  are  prob- ably  high.  Finally,  the  incentives  of  different  players  to  develop  mobile  payments differ. Finally, the cooperation models for the development of  mobile payments could be impacted by the regulation of nonbank players.  The provision of mobile payment solutions could increase the presence of  nonbanks in retail payment systems and, thus, could require a regulatory  intervention to limit the potential risks involved in the economy. So far,  in developed countries, regulators have often tolerated the use of mobile  phones  for  small  transactions  without  requiring  any  banking  license.  However,  this  situation  could  be  called  into  question  if  the  volume  of  mobile payments were to become important. Vodafone has, for instance,  teamed up with Visa in order to successfully develop the German mobile  payment market only recently.        386  Mobile Electronic Commerce  18.6.4  Positioning of MPS What does successful positioning in the MPS market imply?  “Those providers will succeed that offer customers the highest degree  of ‘convenience and value-perception.’”  M-Payment Expert A.M. Bajora,  citated in Hecking, 2012 .  Thus, for successful mass-marketing of MPS, Yang et al.  2012  sug- gest  that  service  providers  increase  the  individual’s  perceived  conve- nience  and  decrease  their  perceived  risk  and  cost  about  the  services.  Therefore, service providers need to extend their services and offer apart  from convenient and fast payment, saving tickets, price comparisons, or  search functions to find the closest shop with the lowest price, for instance   Fingerhut, 2014 . They would need to develop advertising to emphasize  the value of MPS service vs. alternative payment methods such as conve- nience in terms of speed and at the same time show how compatible the  method is with daily life situations as services are accessible everywhere  the consumer is.  Schierz  et  al.   2009   constated,  from  this  result,  that  for  the  adop- tion of MPS, people must find them to be reconcilable with their existing  behavioral patterns. Firms that opt to engage in MPS should fulfill their   promises, exhibit an ethical behavior, and inform the consumers, taking  into account individual user needs and preferences of their target groups,  in order to achieve trust  San-Martin and Lopez-Catalan, 2012 .  PayPal demonstrates that strategies built on trust are successful in the  long run as researchers showed when discovering the influence of trust  on consumer satisfaction.  Confidentiality,  data  integrity,  authentication,  and  nonrepudiation  are  the  most  important  requirements  for  e-commerce  and  mobile  pay- ment  transactions  to  build  trust  among  risk-averse  consumers   Mallat,  2006 .  Other  aspects  Mallat’s   2006   research  found  to  be  significant  for  trust building are anonymity and privacy, which consumers rather associ- ate with banks than with telecom providers  Kreimer and Rodenkirchen,  2010 . Practical implications would be     Security aspects in software and hardware    Technical security standards at technical construction of the service    Reliability as brand benefit in the communication strategy  Influences from friends and social networks have to be considered as crit- ical,  especially  in  the  preadoption  stage,  but  “this  is  especially  the  case  among highly collective-culture countries as China, where individuals are  more easily influenced by other’s opinions than those, living in the low  collective-culture  countries  as  USA,  Great  Britain,  Australia,  etc”   Yang  et  al.  2012,  p.  137 .  Recent  attempts  of  mobile  service  providers  to  pro- mote special fares and flat rates targeted at digital natives by asking their         Chapter eighteen:  Segmenting, targeting, and positioning of mobile  387  friends to participate in and installing a bonus system for new contracts   “Friends gain Friends” by Base Eplus  are going in this direction.  MPS providers can positively influence the consumer perception by     Improving the conditions for retailers to perceive MPS as attractive   enough to adopt it     Showing in their communication executions different situations for  MPS usage to influence the value perception of MPS being more con- venient and adding value than alternative payments     Reducing the payment to maximum €50, spending per buy  Ideally, MPS providers adapt to consumers’ needs and wants and offer  NFC  technology  in  places  where  time  is  a  critical  factor,  for  example,  airports, train stations or bus tram stops, taxicabs, staff canteens, public  libraries, and university cafeterias.  But time saving also implies the expectation that the payment process  is as short as possible. Consumers are not willing to queue up longer in  supermarkets because the mobile payment procedure takes longer than  card payment would take  Hecking, 2013 .  To overcome negative perceptions, service providers would need to     Design various assurance procedures    Create easy-to-understand design of the verification process during an   NFC transaction,     Offer a long-term user-preferential plan    Provide a packaging cost scheme  San-Martin and Lopez-Catalan  2012  questioned whether it would prove  beneficial for mobile service providers to encourage impulse buying via  promotions, etc., since they found out that     It may reduce satisfaction    It may lead to a greater number of complaints, refunds, and returns    It probably sparks negative word of mouth concerning the provider   and regarding m-commerce as a whole  In the postadoption stage, the factor “satisfaction” with MPS might play a  more dominant role and, on the provider’s side, the ability of the provider  to cope with system errors  Yang et al., 2012 .  18.6.5  Summary The following table  Table 18.1  provides an overview of the authors’ man- agement recommendations for segmenting, targeting, and positioning of  a new payment product.        388  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Table 18.1  Overview of STP Options for MPS  Segmenting   Targeting   Positioning   Segmenting the potential  users according to their  personal traits,  especially to their  degree of pre- disposition to adopt  innovations and to their  degree of individual  mobility.

If  one  analyzes  the  success  of  disruptive  technologies  and  applica- tions, the following important parameters have to be seamlessly working  together:      Constant  innovation  capability,  a  reliable  technology  behind  the  product,  progress  in  the  technological  infrastructure,  high  accep- tance rate of retailers and consumers.        Chapter eighteen:  Segmenting, targeting, and positioning of mobile  389  If MPS providers and retailers start to create the preconditions for usage  intention, that is, wide access and compatibility—most preferably in offer- ing the most convenient and secure solution—the mobile payment method  could  receive  more  attention.  But  it  needs  a  concrete  information  policy  from banks and credit card companies and more intense sales activities by  the respective technology providers to convince consumers and retailers  that this technology is worth investing as it will help them increase the  retailer’s sales significantly and build long-term consumer relations.  However, it is almost a fact that only a smaller group of dominant  platforms  and  technologies  will  emerge  from  the  array  of  confusing  standards competing in the market today; there will remain an ecosys- tem of players who are all building trust and can plausibly explain that  their services offer more convenience than conventional payment meth- ods will demonstrate enough value to consumers to replace credit cards  and cash in the long term.

In fact, the widespread use of social networking site mobile applica- tions is a significant indicator of mobile addiction  Salehan and Negahban  2013 .  Technological  developments  in  the  mobile  telephony  industry,  together with an integration with other devices like tablets and laptops   395   396  Mobile Electronic Commerce  and increasing use by consumers, are making the medium increasingly  significant for the strategic planning of firms’ marketing communications. With  a  worldwide  penetration  rate  of  96%  by  2013   International  Telecommunication  Union  2013 ,  mobile  phones  have  become  the  most  ubiquitous of all technologies. This rapid proliferation of mobile phones  along  with  their  technological  development  has  created  a  whole  new  channel for advertising  Saadeghvaziri and Seyedjavadain 2011 .  The  use  of  mobile  phones  as  a  communication  channel  has  trans- formed  the  way  consumers  process  advertising.  Being  able  to  receive  mobile  advertising at the right time and place  can increase consumers’  receptivity to promotions that arrive on their mobile phones. The increas- ing role of mobile phones in consumers’ everyday lives has led to continu- ous growth in mobile advertising budgets as marketers realize that being  connected all the time and everywhere through mobile phones represents  a  great  opportunity  to  advertise  their  products  or  services,  build  and  develop customer relationships, and receive direct responses from those  customers  Google 2012, Martí et al. 2013 .  As a consequence of marketers’ interest, it is anticipated that 20.6 bil- lion dollars per annum will be spent on mobile advertising worldwide by  2015  Gartner 2011 . In 2011 alone, mobile advertising expenditure increased  by 358% in Europe and by 722% in Spain  Inmobi 2012 . The study Mobile  media: consumer insights across Europe by IAB Europe  2011  conducted in  19 European countries indicates that two out of three mobile Internet users  are interested in advertising formats in this medium. With the proliferation  of display campaigns, geolocation marketing, and couponing, mobile phones  are becoming consolidated in the European market as an effective channel  for brands to relate with their potential customers. Hence, the importance  of understanding the factors can help marketing managers to improve the  effectiveness of their mobile marketing campaigns  IAB Europe 2011 .  Mobile advertising allows consumers to access advertising messages at  their convenience. When receiving mobile advertising messages, consum- ers can read them, eliminate them, or purchase the brands advertised. So  factors leading to mobile advertising acceptance can be considered to play  a key role in the success of mobile advertising  Martí et al. 2013 . Although  firms are making increasingly significant investments in mobile marketing,  the nature and implications of this channel are still not fully understood,  and studies are needed to generate an understanding of how their effec- tiveness can be improved  Bauer et al. 2005, Wei 2008, Bellman et al. 2011,  Yang et al. 2013 . The reviews by Varnali and Toker  2010  and Shankar and  Balasubramanian  2009  show significant gaps in this area of study. Previous  research   Yang  et  al.  2013   shows  that  responses  to  mobile  advertising  depend on a two-dimensional structure of attitudes: technology-based eval- uations  utilitarian considerations  and emotion-based evaluations  hedonic  considerations . Mobile advertising is affected both by the characteristics of         Chapter nineteen:  Success factors influencing consumers’ willingness  397  ad communication and by users’ voluntary choices of mobile technology.  Therefore, to better understand how mobile advertising works and to make  it more effective, it is important to explore both utilitarian and hedonic char- acteristics of mobile advertising messages together.  This chapter aims to present an in-depth study of key drivers of con- sumers’ positive intention to buy the brands advertised through mobile  phones  by  analyzing  five  message  characteristics:   1   direct  discounts   2  informativeness,  3  credibility,  4  attitude toward mobile advertising,  and  5  entertainment.  The chapter’s specific goals are to           1. Identify consumer segments more likely to purchase brands adver-  tised through the mobile phone  2. Analyze  the  role  of  utilitarian   direct  discounts,  informativeness,  and  credibility   and  hedonic   attitude  toward  mobile  advertising  and entertainment  message factors on consumer mobile purchase  behavior  3. Provide empirical research on the Spanish market with managerial  implications for advertisers on how to maximize the effectiveness of  mobile advertising in their marketing communications  The chapter is divided into three parts. In the first part, we include the  literature review on key drivers of consumer adoption of mobile adver- tising,  and  we  present  a  conceptual  model  focusing  on  the  rationale  of  the constructs used. In the second part, methodology design, sample, and  measures are presented and validated. Finally, the results are presented  and managerial implications are discussed.  19.2    Factors influencing consumer willingness  to purchase brands advertised through  the mobile phone  Mobile  advertising  has  been  conceptualized  as  “the  set  of  actions  that  enable firms to communicate and relate to their audience in a relevant,  interactive  way  through  any  mobile  device  or  network”   MMA  2010:7 .  This set of actions includes the sending of SMS, the use of graphic or dis- play  formats,  marketing  using  search  engines  through  mobile  Internet,  Bluetooth technology, couponing or the use of applications, and entertain- ment content, including mobile advergaming  MMA 2010 .  The  special  characteristic  of  mobile  technology  is  that  advertising  through this medium can be used to deliver advertising messages that are  radically different from those in traditional advertising  Salo and Tähtinen  2005 . The main benefits of the mobile medium include high penetration,         398  Mobile Electronic Commerce  covering all sectors of society, Internet connection, with online and offline  formats, screen in the medium itself, low cost  Anckar and D’Incau 2002,  Facchetti et al. 2005 , immediate response  Jelassi and Enders 2004 , mea- surable response, fast and concrete information on cost per impact, cost  per response and conversion cost, and easily transportable, so as mobile  advertising messages are ubiquitous, the receiver can be contacted any- where anytime  Jelassi and Enders 2004 .  The success of advertising activities on mobile phones depends largely  on utilitarian and hedonic characteristics of the message, and therefore,  advertisements need to be developed to suit this context  Haghirian et al.  2005,  Yang  et  al.  2012 .  Past  research  has  identified  a  number  of  factors  linked  to  the  advertising  message  predetermining  mobile  advertising  adoption by consumers. This section shows a description of the impact  of  utilitarian   direct  discounts,  informativeness,  and  credibility   and  hedonic   attitude  toward  mobile  advertising  and  entertainment   factors  on  consumers’  willingness  to  purchase  brands  advertised  through  the  mobile phone.  19.2.1  Utilitarian antecedents  19.2.1.1  Direct discounts  The  direct  discounts  variable  refers  to  economic  stimuli  or  incentives,  monetary or otherwise, that advertisers and telephony operators can offer  consumers to obtain their permission to send advertising to their mobile  terminals. These incentives often take the form of discounts, promotions,  or gifts.  Previous research has shown intriguing insights with respect to the  effectiveness of different types of incentives. Varnali et al.  2012  suggest  that consumer personality traits are stronger determinants of responses  to mobile advertising campaigns than permission and incentives. On the  other hand, after investigating whether consumers are willing to receive  mobile advertising if they are provided with certain reward in exchange,  like free telephone time, Tsang et al.  2004  show that giving incentives is  positive  for  consumers  and  favors  the  effectiveness  of  advertising  mes- sages   Newell  and  Meier  2007 .  In  this  line,  Pavlou  and  Stewart   2000   claim  that  in  an  interactive  context,  the  benefits  of  advertising  for  con- sumers can influence, at least indirectly, the measures of advertising effec- tiveness. Barutçu  2007  found that price-sensitive customers have more  positive attitude toward mobile advertising as a consequence of incentives  like  electronic  discount  coupons.  In  short,  the  literature  indicates  that  receivers react very positively to incentive transfer advertising  Varshney  2003 , and so direct discounts have a positive impact on consumer pur- chaser intention.        Chapter nineteen:  Success factors influencing consumers’ willingness  399  19.2.1.2   Information content  Informativeness  is  defined  as  the  extent  to  which  advertising  media   provide users with resourceful and helpful information  Chen and Wells  1999, Ducoffe 1996  and is strongly related to advertising value in tradi- tional media vehicles  Ducoffe 1995 . Bauer et al.  2005  found that mobile  advertising  messages  delivering  a  high  information  value  lead  to  posi- tive attitude toward mobile advertising, which in turn leads to the behav- ioral intention to use mobile advertising services. Tsang et al.  2004  also  found informativeness positively correlated to the overall attitude toward  mobile advertising, along with entertainment and credibility.  Informativeness  is  closely  related  to  advertising  value   Ducoffe  1995 . It has been shown that the quality of the information on a firm’s   website directly influences customer perceptions of the firm and its prod- ucts  Siau and Shen 2003 . Therefore, information delivered to customers  through  mobile  devices  must  also  show  qualitative  characteristics  like   accuracy,  timeliness,  and  usefulness  for  the  consumer   Siau  and  Shen  2003 .  In  addition,  users  demand  rapid  access  to  the  information  they  are  seeking  when  using  the  content.  Information  is  regarded  as  a  very  valuable incentive in mobile advertising  Haghirian et al. 2005 . Several  authors show a positive effect of good information in mobile advertising   e.g., Ducoffe 1996, Barwise and Strong 2002, Bauer et al. 2005, Haghirian  et al. 2005, Haghirian and Inoue, 2007 .  19.2.1.3  Credibility  Mckenzie  and  Lutz   1989,  p.  53   define  advertising  credibility  as  “con- sumer  perception  of  the  truthfulness  and  credibility  of  advertising  in  general,” whereas Pavlou and Stewart  2000, p. 70  refer to it as “predict- ability  of compliance  with the implicit and  explicit requirements  of an  agreement.”  According to Tsang et al.  2004 , credibility is one of the factors that  shape attitudes, and the significance of its impact can be demonstrated.  Haghirian and Inoue  2007  investigated the antecedents of Japanese con- sumer attitude to mobile advertising and found that informative content  and credibility of the advertising message have a significant impact on  consumer  attitude  to  mobile  advertising.  Research  by  Haghirian  et  al.   2005   shows  a  positive  impact  of  credibility  on  the  perceived  value  of  mobile advertising.  Credibility is also influenced by the advertising medium. For exam- ple, Marshall and Woonbong  2003  found that a message on the Internet  achieves  less  credibility  than  a  printed  message  unless  the  message  is  advertised by a strong brand. Therefore, we can assume that a high level  of advertising message credibility is positively associated with purchase  intention.        400  Mobile Electronic Commerce  19.2.2  Hedonic antecedents  19.2.2.1  Attitude toward mobile advertising  Attitude is an individual’s positive or negative evaluation of a given object  or  behavior   Fishben  and  Ajzen  1975,  Ajzen  1991   and  includes  feelings  and affective responses. It refers to an individual’s general willingness to  engage in a given behavior. Attitude stems from individual beliefs about  the behavior and its results and the importance attached to those beliefs.  The  social  psychology  literature  clearly  suggests  that  attitude  has  affec- tive and cognitive components  Bagozzi and Burnkrant 1985, Chaiken and  Stangor 1987, Weiss and Cropanzano 1996 . The affective component of atti- tude refers to how much a person likes the object of their thoughts  i.e. a  product,  service, etc.   Mcguire 1985  and measures the degree of emotional  attraction to the object. The cognitive component refers to an individual’s  concrete beliefs concerning an object  Bagozzi and Burnkrant 1985  and con- sists in value-based evaluation, judgment, reception, and perception of the  object  Chaiken and Stangor 1987 . In particular, the cognitive dimension of  attitude directly influences the use of an individual’s information systems,  whereas the affective dimension needs to be treated as a result variable.  Attitude toward advertising is a combination of cognitive, emotional,  and behavioral processes  Neal et al. 2004 ; According to Batra and Ray’s   1986  model, exposure to an advertising message from a specific brand  first  affects  consumers’  attitude  toward  the  advertisement  and  finally  their  purchase  intention   Mackenzie  and  Lutz  1989 .  In  the  context  of  mobile advertising, Batra and Ray’s  1986  model may mean that advertis- ing messages sent to mobile phones generate a given attitude toward the  message, which in turn will affect the purchase intention.  Mitchell and Olson  1981  study positive and negative effects of adver- tising and report that consumer attitude to advertising affect brand atti- tude and purchase intention through their feelings and emotions over the  advert itself. This may lead to changes in the conative component, such as  greater purchase intention or purchase itself  Lutz et al. 1983, Lutz 1985,  Batra and Ray 1986, Mckencie et al. 1986 .  19.2.2.2  Entertainment  Entertainment denotes full capacity to satisfy consumer needs of “escap- ism,  fun,  aesthetic  enjoyment  or  emotional  liberation”   Mcquail  1983 .  Mobile entertainment services are undoubtedly one of the most impor- tant  drivers  of  mobile  marketing   Barutçu  2007   because  fast  and  easy  access to entertainment is always attractive for many customer segments  as it gives the opportunity to kill time and have fun in situations where  it  is  impossible  to  access  home  entertainment  devices   Varshney  et  al.  2000 .  Furthermore,  entertainment  services  can  increase  customer  loy- alty as it provides added-value services for them  Haghirian et al. 2005 ,         Chapter nineteen:  Success factors influencing consumers’ willingness  401    Informativeness  Credibility  Direct discounts     Figure 19.1  Conceptual model.  Willingness to buy brands advertised  through mobile phones  Attitude toward  mobile    advertising Entertainment  involving them deeply and familiarizing them with advertised services  and  products.  A  high  degree  of  pleasure  and  involvement  during  the  interaction leads to subjective perceptions of affection and a positive state  of mind in consumers  Hoffman and Novak 1996 . The feeling of enjoy- ment associated with advertising plays the most important role in creat- ing general attitude toward them  Shavitt et al. 1998 .  Entertainment has been identified as an emotional factor contributing  to the formation of consumers’ attitude toward advertising  Wang et al.  2002 . Pleasurable contexts—like those supported by entertainment—and  mood created by these contexts have a positive influence on the attitude  toward the ad  Moorman et al. 2002  and on the effects of the ad  Srull  1983, Goldberg and Gorn 1987 . It also has been found that consumers’  feelings  of  enjoyment  associated  with  advertisements  play  the  greatest  role in accounting for their overall attitude toward the ads  Shavitt et al.  1998 . Entertainment has been found to be an influencing factor affecting  the intention to use mobile services  Leong et al. 2013  and consumers’  attitude toward mobile advertising  Tsang et al. 2004, Saadeghvaziri and  Seyedjavadain 2011, Martí et al. 2013 .  Therefore, we can state that perceived entertainment will have a favor- able impact on purchase intention for the brands advertised in mobile ads. The conceptual model of mobile electronic commerce adoption which  will be contrasted in the Spanish market  see Figure 19.1  is an outcome of  the literature review presented earlier.  19.3    Case study: Mobile advertising adoption  by Spanish mobile users  19.3.1  Methodology After utilitarian and hedonic antecedents of mobile advertising adoption  have been discussed, in this section, an empirical study of the Spanish  market is presented.  A  field  study  was  conducted  with  mobile  telephony  users  who  received  mobile  advertising.  The  target  population  was  young  people,  mainly university students toward the end of their degree courses.        402  Mobile Electronic Commerce  The research instrument employed to obtain information was a survey  with close-ended questions. Studyby questionnaire has the advantages of  convenience and rapid collection of data  Soroa-Koury and Yang 2010  and  the ability to allow inferences on consumer behavior for a given population  based on a sample  Babbie 1990 . The questionnaire was developed and  tested with five focus groups—PhD students  3 , professors of marketing at  the University of Valencia  1 , and professionals of marketing and informa- tion system activities  1 —to examine the dynamics of mobile users with  different levels of previous experience and familiarity with mobile adver- tising formats. The pretest instructed respondents to fill out the question- naire and report any feedback. As a result of the pretest, some redundant  questions were eliminated, and some of the scales were adapted in order to  facilitate understanding and avoid erroneous interpretations.  Sample  selection  procedure  was  convenience  nonprobability  sam- pling. This type of sampling had been used in many prior studies in the  area  of  mobile  advertising  with  a  large  proportion  of  young  university  students  e.g., Yang 2007, Jayawardhena et al. 2009, Soroa-Koury and Yang  2010 . Young adults were chosen because consumers under 30 years old  are the first adopters of mobile services in general  Bigné et al. 2007 , and  they are familiar with the services and use them in a greater proportion  than the general population  Wilska 2003, Karjaluoto et al. 2005 .  Questionnaires were delivered to and collected from volunteer partic- ipants over the age of 15. A total of 250 consumers were contacted during  the survey; 219 agreed to participate in this study. Among the question- naires received, 208 were completed and analyzed. Only 34% of the sam- ple does not have a smartphone.  Demographics are shown in Figures 19.2 through 19.4  see the follow-  ing text .  The average age of the sample is 32 years old, with 43% men and 57%  women. Of the sample considered, 78% have completed university studies,  and 24.4% have completed secondary school. Also, 27% of the participants   Age  Gender  35%–49  9%  50 and over  3%  25%–34  40%  14%–24  48%  Female 57%  Male 43%  14–24  25–34  35–49  50 and over  Male  Female  Figure 19.2  Sample demographics: age and gender.

Less than 50% of the sample has  an income below the average.  All the variables were measured using Likert scales developed in pre-  vious research, thereby ensuring content validity  see Table 19.1 .  19.3.2  Results The conceptual model was tested with a structural equations model using  EQS 6.1 for Windows. However, before contrasting the model, the scales  for the six constructs were assessed using confirmatory factor analysis to  determine scale reliability and validity  Anderson and Gerbing 1988 . First  of all, the scale items were analyzed to ensure they measured the latent  variables and so the scores must correlate highly with each other and be  internally consistent. Model fit proved satisfactory in the various indexes  used: NFI = 0.912, NNFI = 0.959, CFI = 0.963, IFI = 0.964, SRMR = 0.079,         404  Variable   Table 19.1  Measurement of Variables  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Sources   Tsang et al.  2004 , Yang  2007   Entertainment EN1.

Cronbach’s alpha value is good for all constructs as it exceeds the mini- mum threshold of 0.7  Fornell and Larcker 1981 , and the average variance  extracted is above the cutoff value of 0.5  Fornell and Larcker 1981  for all  the variables. Thus, the proposed scales have appropriate reliability.  A model is regarded as having convergent validity if the scale items  are significantly correlated with the latent variables they are supposed to  measure. Hair et al.  1998  recommend that in addition to being signifi- cant, average loading on each factor should be above 0.7. Table 19.2 shows  that all the factors were significant with average loadings above 0.7.  Discriminant validity was evaluated using  1  the confidence interval  test  Anderson and Gerbing 1988 , which determines validity if the inter- val does not include the value 1 and  2  the variance extracted test  Fornell  and Larcker 1981  confirming that the squared covariance for each pair  of factors is lower than the variance extracted for each factor. Both these  methods confirm validity  see Table 19.3 .        406  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Table 19.3  Discriminant Validity  F2   F3   F4   F5   F6   F1. Incentives  F2.

Results  show   Table  19.4   that  direct  discounts  and  attitude  toward  the mobile advertising ad and entertainment significantly affect consum- ers’ brand purchase intention whereas information content and credibil- ity  do  not  have  a  significant  influence.  Direct  discounts  is  the  variable  with greater influence on the willingness to purchase brands advertised  through mobile phones.  19.4  Conclusions and implications The  recent  development  of  mobile  advertising  has  brought  significant  changes in the communication process, which in turn is changing digital  consumer behavior. Nowadays, new terminals provide consumers with  more entertainment, information content, and incentives for mobile com- munications, which requires further investigation into the effectiveness of  mobile advertising  Shankar et al. 2010 .        Chapter nineteen:  Success factors influencing consumers’ willingness  407  This chapter not only contributes to the body of academic knowledge  of mobile commerce but also offers recommendations for effective man- agement of mobile advertising campaigns. First, the study confirms the  significant  influence  of  attitude  toward  mobile  advertising,  incentives,  and  entertainment  on  purchase  intention,  indicating  the  importance  of  the  mobile  medium  not  only  for  communicating  particular  promotions  but also for creating and managing brand image mainly by creating emo- tional ties with consumers through the use of entertainment. Given the  importance of attitude toward mobile advertising, firms should system- atically analyze the factors that can improve that attitude. Second, mobile  advertising campaign managers should issue messages that offer enter- tainment, making use of the increasing number of multimedia tools on  mobile terminals because they are more appreciated than the information  content. Users want entertainment on their mobile phones and prefer to  use other more traditional means when finding out about a product, ser- vice, or brand. Another conclusion is the mobile phone’s potential for cou- poning as the value of economic incentives through this medium has been  demonstrated.  Advertisers  and  advertising  professionals  should  exploit  this, making use of the mobile phone’s ubiquity to do the promotion for  their products at the appropriate time and place and persuade consumers  to choose the advertised brand at the moment of purchase. Advertisers  and advertising professionals should take good note of this. A success- ful information campaign must be conducted through entertainment, for  example, with a pedagogical advergame or a video that is fun as well as  informative, or by including a direct discount along with information.  These  conclusions  should  not  be  generalized  unreasonably,  given  the  limitations of this study. The first limitation stems from the small convenience  sample. Most of the participants are university students. Bamba and Barnes   2007  suggest that the student population is a core target market for mobile  operators and advertisers. Another possible limitation is that the study has  focused on measuring attitudes, which do not always become behaviors.  In view of the things discussed so far, we recommend future lines of  research: contrasting the proposed model with a representative popula- tion sample and an evaluation of the results by establishing comparisons  according to demographic classifications and conducting experiments to  evaluate real purchase behavior.

New  players  like  Apple  and  Google have entered the market, launching a wave of innovation through  the industry. After several failed attempts, for example, WAP and i-Mode in  Europe, a market for attractive mobile services was created and is continu- ally growing. This changing playing field has diverse implications for all  actors involved, and many are taking up new places in the value network:  New players enter the field, roles and relationships change, and the inter- ests of companies and stakeholders—including their business models—are  redrawn   see  e.g.,  Basole,  2009 .  These  shifts  appear  to  be  going  hand  in  hand with a trend of  platformization, that is, diverse companies adopting  platform strategies as they vie for dominance in mobile service provision.  The different types of platforms we can identify in this sector were only  recently made explicit and validated  see e.g., Ballon et al., 2009 .  These strategic business model changes are occurring while the context  of  the  main  target  audience  of  mobile  service  providers—the  consumer— changes  as  well.  Although  it  is  a  much  more  gradual  process,  it  is  now  accepted that an increased urbanization will be one of the main societal trends  in coming years  Brand, 2006 . Since 2007, over half of the world’s population  lives in cities and the UN predicts this number will only grow, to a predicted  70% by 2050  UN HABITAT, 2010 . As more citizens  and consumers  move  to  urban  areas,  actors  from  ICT  and  mobile  telecommunications  naturally  become increasingly interested in offering services that are tailored to life in  the urban environment. Cities and local governments are at the same time  exploring the role that new ICT services and products can play in increasing  the quality of life of their citizens. In recent years, this quest is often captured  in the Smart City concept, which will be briefly touched upon later on.  Currently,  cities  are  struggling  to  see  which  roles  they  can  take  up  in  this  quickly  changing  landscape  of  mobile  services.  The  aim  of  this   chapter  is  to  apply  a  general  mobile  services  typology  to  the  specific  context of the city, creating a framework cities can use to consider their  place in the value network. We will explore the different platform roles  a city government can take up in supporting, facilitating, and or provid- ing  mobile  services  to  citizens  and  travelers  by  applying  and  adapting  the general mobile service platform typology to this context, based on the  thorough analysis of several international cases.  20.2  Framework As a first step in this chapter, we will briefly summarize the concept of  platformization. While there have been some attempts at conceptualiz- ing ICT platforms  Schiff, 2003; Evans et al., 2005; Eisenmann, 2007  and         Chapter twenty:  Smart city as a service platform  417  the seminal work by Gawer and Cusumano  2002  identifying platform  leadership  strategies,  these  operationalizations  do  not  entirely  cover  the  platform  types  currently  active  in  the  mobile  services   industry.  Evans et al.  2005  provide an overview of different platforms in what  they call computer-based industries, discussing the particulars of the  Symbian mobile platform, but do not offer an analysis of different plat- form  types  within  a  specific  sector,  in  this  case,  mobile  communica- tions. Furthermore, they distinguish between four platform functions   matchmakers,  audience  makers,  transaction-based  businesses,  and  shared-input  platforms ,  which  are  all  roles  a  mobile  platform  could  take up and thus are not mutually exclusive in this more specific con- text.  Eisenmann   2007   distinguishes  between  proprietary  platforms  that consist of a single provider that individually controls its  technology  and shared platforms in which multiple firms collaborate in develop- ing the platform’s technology and then compete in offering users dif- ferent but compatible versions of the platform. However, most, if not  all,  platforms  operating  in  mobile  services  today  externalize  mostly  proprietary  technologies  but  at  the  same  time  usually  incorporate  also  some  standardized  and  shared  functionalities.  Schiff   2003   dis- tinguishes between a platform that delivers an active matching service   e.g., an Internet search engine  and a platform that passively mediates   e.g.,  Adobe  Acrobat .  However,  the  various  mobile  service   platform  models at the same time provide active  matching services  e.g., through  personalization  features   as  passive  mediation   e.g.,  through  offering  an SDK . Although these authors provide very valuable contributions,  the main differentiators between different types of mobile service plat- forms remain illusive.  What  does  appear  to  distinguish  the  various  types  is  the  ques- tion  whether  control  over  assets  is  linked  to  control  over  customers   Ballon, 2009a . As some examples from the mobile services industry  demonstrate, to control some crucial value adding roles does not nec- essarily mean that the platform owner also has control over the cus- tomer  i.e., end user  relationship, or has control over all, or even most,  assets  needed  to  create  the  value  proposition.  By  reinterpreting  the  business  models  currently  employed  in  the  mobile  communications  industry in this light, four basic platform types can be distinguished.  This  typology  is  the  result  of  extensive  conceptual  and  empirical  work, thoroughly described in Ballon  2009b . The four general plat- form types for mobile service delivery, including examples, are repre- sented in Table 20.1.  It is important to note here that when using the term “platform,” we  do this referring to the concept of two- or multisided markets  Rochet and  Tirole,  2003;  Ballon,  2009a ,  rather  than  a  technological  platform  per  se,  approaching the issue more from the perspective of business modeling         418  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Control  over assets  No control  over assets  Table 20.1  Mobile Service Platform Typology  No control over customers   Control over customers   Enabler platform The platform owner controls  many of the necessary  assets to ensure the value  proposition, but does not  control the customer  relationship. Examples: Google Android   pre-Google Play  Neutral platform The platform owner is  strongly reliant on the  assets of other actors to  create the value proposition,  and does not control the  customer relationship. Examples: LiMo, Bondi, WAC  Integrator platform The platform owner controls  many of the assets to ensure the  value proposition, and  establishes a relationship with  end users. Entry of third-party  service providers is encouraged. Examples: iPhone with iOS and  iTunes App Store, Nokia Ovi Broker platform The platform owner is strongly  reliant on the assets of other  actors to create the value  proposition, but does control the  customer relationship.

A platform in  this  context  should  be  seen  as  an  entity  that  mediates  between  at  least  two sides of a market  e.g., developers, advertisers, and end users , creat- ing new value within the value network through its existence. In practice  and in the context of city governments, this may crystallize into a tech- nical solution, but could equally turn out to be a more virtual approach,  for  example,  several  smaller  initiatives  taken  by  diverging  city  govern- ment agencies combined. As such, it is not so much the entire geographi- cal region of a city that we regard as a platform in this case, but rather  the  combined  efforts  government  bodies  undertake  in  bringing  mobile  services to citizens. This notion is also referred to by O’Reilly  2010  in  “Government  as  a  Platform,”  saying  that  new  forms  of  government  or  “government  2.0”  should  “use   …   technology—especially  the  collaborative  technologies at the heart of web 2.0—to better solve collective problems at a city,  state, national and international level.”  This chapter will apply the preceding typology to city initiatives in  order to assess whether and which platform dynamics are at play in the  city. In order to achieve this, we will first need to sketch the context of the  city more clearly. We will briefly look at attempts to define the Smart City  concept and explore how mobile services and platform strategies can fit  within it.        Chapter twenty:  Smart city as a service platform  419  20.3  City context The  term  Smart  Cities  has  been  used  in  different  ways:  to  describe  a   cluster of innovative organizations within a region, the presence of indus- try branches that have a strong focus on ICT, business parks, the actual  educational level of the inhabitants of a certain city, the use of modern  technologies in an urban context, and technological means that increase  government efficiency and efficacy and so on  see e.g., Komninos, 2009 .  Giffinger  et  al.   2007   describe  medium-sized  European  Smart  Cities  and  define  a  Smart  City  using  six  characteristics  in  which  such  a  city  performs  in  a  forward-looking  way:  Smart  Economy,  Smart  People,  Smart  Governance,  Smart  Mobility,  Smart  Environment,  and  Smart  Living.  Caragliu et al.  2009  propose a definition based on the aforementioned  study: “We believe a city to be smart when investments in human and  social capital and traditional  transport  and modern  ICT  communica- tion infrastructure fuel sustainable economic growth and a high quality  of life, with a wise management of natural resources, through participa- tory governance.”  This view is supported by the somewhat technologically determin- istic idea of a control room or dashboard for the city, providing an archi- tecture and ICT-based overview of all activity in the city as well as the  tools to  automatically  interact with infrastructures or adjust parameters  to predefined optima  IBM, 2009 . These architectural or infrastructural  viewpoints are contrasted by a more experimental, bottom-up view on the  Smart City. In this perspective, innovation comes from the people using the  city or is at least cocreated with citizens, a process that can be stimulated  by government  Camponeschi, 2011 . Examples of this can be found in the  growing trend of open data initiatives and hackathons, stimulating devel- opers to create applications based on cities’ databases, or the use of social  media to organize local and ad hoc or more structural events and even  protests, placing the ownership of the city decidedly with its users  de Lange  and de Waal, 2012 . Interventions in the public space by small groups of  citizens could also be framed in this context and have been referred to  as small change or tactical urbanism  Hamdi, 2004 . This entails citizens  taking the initiative and becoming active agents of change in their city  or  neighborhood.  In  such  a  perspective,  what  defines  the  Smart  City  is  not  the  infrastructures  or  architectures  it  offers  but  the  ways  in  which  its citizens interact with these systems as well as each other. In between  the top-down or bottom-up views on the Smart City, one could envision  the  role  the  city  plays  as  a  platform,  as  sitting  somewhere  in  between,  bringing together city governments, private interest, and citizens. While  any definitions remain broad, the Smart Cities concept can entail many  diverging  elements,  which  are  all  in  some  way  captured  by  them.  In  the  urban  context,  in  which  mobility,  information,  and  accessibility  are         420  Mobile Electronic Commerce  all  important  to  inhabitants,  mobile  services  can  be  one  of  many  tools  to  make  advances  in  many  of  the  areas  listed  earlier   Greenfield,  2013;  Townsend, 2013 . Obviously much is dependent on the policy foci laid out  by city governments, and it is likely the emphasis on certain topics will be  different among cities.  The Smart City concept has also been criticized, amongst others for  its potentially self-congratulatory tone, as well as its focus on I C T and  the potential consequences toward reinforcing a digital divide  Hollands,  2008 . If insufficient attention is paid to this topic, the fear exists that the  strong  focus  on  information  technologies  in  the  Smart  Cities  discourse  can dramatically impact the digital divide in the negative sense, creating  even larger inequalities and social divisions in the city  Graham, 2002 ,  a far cry from what would be labeled smart. This is thus a consideration  every policy maker should keep in mind when working on Smart City– type initiatives. With regard to the topic of this chapter, it is clear that the  concept of Smart Cities carries relevance, particularly when considering  the  implications  of  viewing  the  city  as  a  platform,  but  it  should  not  be  overstated and seen as a contextual element in the context of mobile ser- vices, from the domain of policy making: Mobile services can be a tool,  like  many  others,  in  increasing  the  quality  of  life  of  citizens,  but  their  application is still very much a matter of local policy decisions.  In what follows, we reexamine the platform typology and clarify its  constituting elements in the context of the city. Next, we apply it to vari- ous international cases, exposing the different platform strategies cities  can undertake.  20.4  Toward a platform typology for the city Given  the  more  specific  nature  of  the  application  domain  and  the  ele- ments detailed in the preceding section, we can delineate the constitut- ing components of the platform typology in a more fine-grained way. An  important aspect related to the generalizability of the platform typology  lies in the definition of the two control parameters: assets and customers.  These parameters need to be well defined and relevant in order to allow  the typology to be applied to the somewhat different area of mobile city  services. This section will elaborate on that issue.  In  the  context  of  the  city,  we  can  start  by  defining  the  first  control  parameter, control over assets, more clearly. For our purposes, having con- trol  over  the  value-adding,  tangible  and  intangible  assets  that  form  the  value proposition means that a city is in control of how services are cre- ated. For example, this can mean setting up support mechanisms for devel- opers that want to build city services and performing some kind of quality  check on these services. Or a city could take a more active role and provide  a development and distribution environment, for example, with APIs or         Chapter twenty:  Smart city as a service platform  421  an SDK, where developers can create and disseminate services that carry  a specific city brand, building a more technology-centric solution. Another  example could be opening up data and statistical information about the  urban environment. In the latter case, the city is not in direct control over  the services that are developed but still leverages a form of control over  the assets, namely, the data it chooses to make public, and perhaps more  importantly, which data it does not. Additionally, the city could provide the  required infrastructure that makes certain city services possible  e.g., sen- sors, QR-codes, fixed and wireless networks, and so on . Therefore, in the  context of the city, we prefer to refer to this parameter as control over data  and or infrastructure. This parameter is guided by questions like:     To  what  extent  does  ownership  of  the  data infrastructure  remain      Does the license provided by the city  if any  prohibit certain uses of   with the city?  the data infrastructure?     Does the city provide APIs to access their data?    Are initiatives, programs, or actions related to mobile services men-  tioned or considered in policy plans?  As far as control over customers is concerned, this parameter refers to the  entity the end user  or citizen in this case  has the direct interaction with.  In our case, the mobile service that is offered to the citizen is the medium  via which local governments reach the public. Hence, this parameter is  redefined as whether or not the local city government has control over the  service offering  or value proposition . By this we mean that the city is in  one capacity or another involved in or has control over the actual creation  of the service and the resulting product or value proposition that is being  offered to the end user. The way the service is branded can be an indicator  in this case as well as the guiding questions:     Is the service developed in-house by the city  or at least by directly  contracted  developers,  executing  a  clear  assignment   or  are  the  developers completely external to the city’s organization?     Does the city have control over or impact on the contents of the ser-  vice during the creation process?     Does the city have access to profile identity information of the end  users of the services, or does it gather data or statistics on end users  in any way  e.g., related to usage or popularity ?     Is a form of quality control performed by the city before or after apps   are released?  With these parameters more clearly defined, we can explore what the dif- ferent city platform types would look like. The following sections will         422  Mobile Electronic Commerce  describe the platform types in the specific framework of the city, as well  as provide at least one case study for each platform. To structure the case  studies, we use the framework detailed in Walravens  2012  that describes  business  model  parameters  that  come  into  play  when  a  public  entity   in this case a city government  becomes an actor in the value network.  The framework describes parameters connected to governance and control  on the one hand and value and public value on the other. In this sense, these  parameters are directly related to the question of assets  or data and infra- structure  and customers  or the service offering  in the platform typology.  The parameters of this framework are represented in Figure 20.1.  The two columns on the left side of the matrix represent the public  and business model parameters related to control and governance and  say  something  about  the  level  of  control  the  city  keeps  over  data  and  infrastructure. The right two columns discuss parameters related to the  value that is being created within the value network and provide more  insight into the service offering that is presented to the citizen in our case.  This  framework  helps  to  take  a  more  structured  approach  to  the  case  studies and provides a guideline, allowing us to describe the cases in a  comparative way, building up more information on the level of control  over data and infrastructure on the one hand, and the service offering on   Business design  parameters  Value network  Technical architecture  Financial architecture  Value proposition  Control parameters   Value parameters  Control over assets  Modularity  Investment structure  User involvement  Concentrated vs.  distributed  Modular vs. integrated  Concentrated vs.  distributed  Enabled, encouraged, dissuaded, or blocked  Vertical integration  Distribution of intelligence  Revenue model  Intended value  Integrated vs. disintegrated  Centralized vs. distributed  Direct vs. indirect  Control over customers Direct vs. mediated proﬁle and identity  management  Interoperability  Revenue sharing  Enabled, encouraged, dissuaded or blocked  Yes or no  Price quality lock-in eﬀects  Positioning  Complements vs.  substitutes branding  Public design parameters  Policy goals  Organizational  Public governance parameters  Public value parameters  Good governance  Technology governance  Harmonizing existing policy  goals and regulation  Accountability and trust Stakeholder management  Choices in  public   stakeholder involvement  Inclusive vs. exclusive Open vs. closed data  Public data ownership Deﬁnition of conditions under which and with whom data is shared  ROPI  Expectations on financial returns multiplier eﬀects  Public value creation  Public value justiﬁcation Market failure motivation  Public partnership model  Public value evaluation  PPP, PFI, PC...

All the information presented here has been  gathered through  desk research and comes from official policy documents, as well as aca- demic  case  studies  and  analyses  in  specialized  media.  The  first  type  of platform that is investigated in the context of the city is the Enabler  Platform.  20.5  Enabler city platform Considering  the  definitions  of  the  control  parameters  mentioned  ear- lier,  we  see  a  few  potential  models  that  can  be  labeled  as  Enabler  City  Platforms.  One  is  the  case  of  a  city  providing  open  data  and  statistical  information to interested developers. The city does not control the service  offering as services are developed by third parties but does control assets  in the sense that it decides which data is made available and under which  conditions. There are several possible approaches to opening up data: a  city can create an online platform where anyone is free to download raw  information on the city and create services on top of it. A slightly more  closed model requires interested developers to apply with the city based  on the service they have in mind, before being allowed access to the data.  Whereas some cities take a cautious approach and do not go very far in  supporting the developer communities that might be interested by plac- ing particularly large quantities or interesting types of data online, oth- ers  go  further  by  attempting  to  stimulate  and  often  create  a  developer  community.  Both in the United States and Europe, the number of cities opening up  datasets to developers is steadily growing and the number of cases is legio.  Depending on the implementation and resources devoted to the initiative,  some cities have been more successful than others, inspiring developers to  create innovative applications or visualization. In Europe, cities have been  obligated to begin opening up datasets under impulse of the European  Commission.  The  Re-use  of  Public  Sector  Information  Directive,  cre- ated by the European Commission, was a first step to open up data from  the  public  sector  to  citizens.  The  2003  Directive  was  implemented  into  national law of the 27 Member States by May 2008 and “encourages the  EU  Member  States  to  make  public  sector  information  available  for  pri- vate and public organizations as well as for citizens”  EC, 2011 . However,  the Directive only yielded limited results, as the text remained vague on  what types of datasets and in which formats the Member States needed  to open up. In December 2011, the European Commission again stressed  the importance of open data, even describing it as the new gold with the  launch of an “Open Data Strategy,” building on the work in the 2003 PSI  Directive  EC, 2011 . In this perspective, cities truly act as enablers, offering  relevant information to developers and stimulating them to create new  value. An additional way to stimulate a developer community to create         424  Mobile Electronic Commerce  quality applications is organizing a competition linked to open data usage,  often referred to as Apps for X. These hackathons are being organized all  over the world, including in cities like New York, Washington DC  one  of the first cities to set up such a competition , Amsterdam, Berlin, Paris,  London, and so on. These types of initiatives can encourage the develop- ment and deployment of city services in a way that is relatively easy and  cost-effective to implement for a city government.  20.5.1  Case: London Data Portal and the London Bike App The case we selected is the city of London taking up an Enabler Platform  role by creating the London Data Portal on which open data about the city  was made available to developers. As an example, we include the London  Bike App that was created using the data distributed by the city, to illus- trate the potential services coming out of these initiatives. London Bike  App allows end users to see the live availability of bikes in the sharing  system exploited by Transport for London  TfL , the city’s official public  transportation organization. The application is available for iOS only and  costs €0.79 or £0.69. It was developed by an independent developer called  Big Ted, Ltd., who made use of the City of London’s open data initiative  to create the service and keep its information up to date in near real time.  20.5.1.1  Control and governance issues  One of the most important assets in the creation of the service offering  of this application is the actual real-time data, which is controlled and  offered by TfL and the City of London. In January 2009, TfL launched  a so-called Developer Area on its website that gives access to datasets  and  real-time  traffic  and  public  transport  information.  There  are  cur- rently  30  feeds  available  in  TfL’s  Developer  Area  that  can  be  accessed  after  information  on  how  and  where  they  will  be  used  as  well  as  the  target audience and the estimated audience is provided  Transport for  London, 2012a . The value network is somewhat integrated as the data  is controlled and choices for availability are made by TfL, but it is rela- tively easily available. Control over the customer does not lie with TfL,  nor  the  City  of  London,  but  rather  with  the  application  and  its  devel- oper,  as  TfL  explicitly  prohibits  app  developers  that  make  use  of  the  real-time  data  to  use  TfL  branding,  templates,  or  house  styles   see  the  following  text .  The  bike  system  is  heavily  sponsored  by  international  finances firm Barclays and is, as a result, mostly known as the Barclays  Cycle Hire system in London. Developers are allowed to use this brand- ing  under certain conditions  and so some of the customer relationship  may be shared with Barclays. In this case, the developer does not require  a registration from end users, so there is no profile or identity manage- ment occurring on this side. Although the city is not directly involved         Chapter twenty:  Smart city as a service platform  425  in  the  creation  or  distribution  of  this  bike  application  and  has  no  offi- cial link to it, the fact that it was possible to develop it is a direct con- sequence of the city’s open data policy, which aligns with certain good  governance principles. At the launch of the London Data Store in January  2010, Mayor Boris Johnson emphasized the importance of transparency  of government, saying “sunlight is the best disinfectant”  London Data  Store, 2010 . In a first step, the mayor made all expenditures of the Greater  London Authority  GLA  more than £100,000 transparent and available  online in an effort to give citizens more insight into government spend- ing and reduce it at the same time. This led to the launch of the London  Data Store, an initiative by the GLA to open up as much data it holds  as possible. In a debate at the launch of the London Data Store, the late  Sir  Simon  Milton   London’s  Deputy  Mayor  for  Policy  and  Planning  at  the time  highlighted other elements related to good governance, saying  the  open  data  initiative  was  aimed  at  bringing  significant  public  benefits  and  improving  quality  of  life   London  Data  Store,  2010 .  He  spoke  about  a “ post-bureaucratic age in which decision-making is put back into the  hands of the public, that can base itself on correct and open information  on government”  London Data Store, 2010 . Additionally, the importance  of stimulating the local economy was also highlighted as a potential ben- efit  of  opening  up  data,  by  encouraging  local  developers  and  creative  people to explore commercial opportunities. These principles are framed  in  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act  2000,  enforced  by  the  Information  Commissioner and aim to ensure an open government. This legislation  addresses  public  authorities  and  places  two  main  duties  on  them:  “to  adopt and maintain a publication scheme setting out the classes of infor- mation which the authority publishes and how it intends to publish the  information, to respond to individual requests for information under the  general right of access to information, from January 2005”  London Data  Store, 2012a . This act gives individuals the right to request any govern- ment data, unless it is privacy sensitive or a matter of national security.  The GLA aims to involve as many public stakeholders as possible in the  Data Store initiative and clearly states it “is committed to influencing and  cajoling other public sector organisations into releasing their data here  too”  London Data Store, 2012b . Since the TfL started publishing some of  their data feeds up to a year before the London Data Store was opened,  it was a logical partner and links to the TfL Developer Area are available  in the London Data Store as well.  Although the TfL makes an effort to release data that is at least easily  machine-readable, the use of interoperable standards varies depending  on the type of data. In the case of the Barclays Bicycle Hire, the infor- mation  is  available  in  an  XML-feed  since  June  2011.  This  feed  allows  developers  to  relatively  easily  access  real-time  availability  data  from  the bike-sharing locations and includes the name, location,  coordinates,         426  Mobile Electronic Commerce  and  maximum  number  of  docking  points  for  all  operational  docking  locations,  as  well  as  the  number  of  available  bikes  and  available  free  docking  points.  Before  the  feed  was  made  available,  the  developer  of  the London Bike App scraped it off the TfL website, using a Google App  Engine  application   Wise,  2010 .  Today’s  feed  is  updated  every  3  min  and allows for a maximum of 30 min between capturing and display- ing a feed  Transport for London, 2012b . The information is free to use,  scalable and robust, as well as the source of data for TfL’s own  website.  It comes with a data dictionary that explains the terminology used in  the  XML-feed,  to  make  the  process  easier  for  developers   Transport  for London, 2011 . By making use of the XML-standard and providing  documentation to developers, TfL makes an effort toward technology  governance by being relatively inclusive in its approach to opening up  data: Developers with some minor experience should be able to make  use of the data. This of course does not naturally imply that the avail- able  data  is  easily  accessible  or  understandable  to  the  general  public.  It is up to the developer or web designer to take the data and make it  easily interpretable to the public, and this is where some issues of inclu- sivity  may  arise:  Although  the  open  data  feed  is  publicly  and  freely  available,  developers  are  free  to  create  commercial  applications  with  them. TfL clearly states, “Can I charge people to use the app I develop  using your feeds?—Yes, you are welcome to charge the public for appli- cations you produce using TfL syndicated data”  Transport for London,  2012c . Given this  understandable  policy, developers may be inclined  to develop for the largest platforms only, because there may be the most  revenue to be made, or simply because they are more skilled in creating  software for these platforms. This is the case for the London Bike App,  which is only available on iOS, due to the developer’s technical experi- ence with the platform  Wise, 2012 . Although the GLA does not make  recommendations or suggestions toward developing for multiple plat- forms, it does have an internal Accessible Communications Policy that  aims at combatting the effects of racism, social exclusion and the removal of  other discriminatory barriers to full participation in society  GLA, 2012  by  providing translations of documents, help with interpretation of docu- ments and ensuring all GLA websites are available in all browsers and  are compatible with all systems. The developer of the London Bike App  does encourage creating applications for other platforms or cities and  has made the source code for the service available to anyone interested   Wise, 2011 .  20.5.1.2  Value and public value issues  The investment in the London Data Portal is carried by the GLA and the  platform  does  not  have  a  direct  revenue  model,  but  it  is  rather  aimed  at stimulating a developer economy in the city. Initially, the GLA also         Chapter twenty:  Smart city as a service platform  427  partnered  with  Channel  4’s  4iP  investment  fund  that  made  £100,000  available for innovative applications that make use of public data. The  program  was  however  stopped  after  a  Channel  4  restructuring  at  the  end of 2010  Channel 4, 2010 . The return on public investment expected  by the GLA for its open data initiative was already highlighted earlier  and  is  mainly  focused  on  indirect  financial  return  in  the  form  of  an  active London-based developer community  that  attempts  to  capitalize  on the commercial opportunities created by opening up datasets. Next  to this multiplier effect, there is also a strong focus in the rhetoric on  improving the quality of life of the public and increasing transparency  in government  see preceding text . The London Bike App could be seen  as a successful product of both these goals. The data is licensed and pro- vided to anyone interested and no particular public–private cooperation  model is set up.  There is potential for user involvement, dependent on their level of  app development skills or education in understanding and interpreting  the  data  made  available  by  the  government.  Otherwise,  this  aspect  is  less present both in the open data initiative or the specific app in ques- tion.  The  intended  value  of  the  cheap  application   apart  from  offering  an app for free, €0.79 is the lowest amount developers can charge in the  iTunes App Store  is providing better access to the Barclays Bicycle Hire  system  that  consists  of  6,000  bikes  in  400  docking  stations  across  cen- tral London  Transport for London, 2012b . The app can provide a list of  bike availability at the 20 docking stations closest to the user’s location  as well as a map view that offers a real-time overview. Since the Barclays  system uses a variable pricing scheme based on the time of day, the app  also  provides  a  timer  that  shows  the  user  when  prices  will  increase,  together with a price estimate of the user’s current trip. TfL is very clear  in its materials that developers cannot position the services and applica- tions they develop as being officially endorsed by or affiliated with the  transport company. To this end, TfL have composed clear and detailed  guidelines for developers on the use of TfL logos, brands, or house styles   e.g., Transport for London, 2012d,e . These guidelines deal with the use  of logos, fonts, lettering, colors, and so on not only in developers’ promo- tional materials but also in the applications’ user interface  Transport for  London, 2012b .  The preceding paragraphs have already provided an overview of the  types  of  public  value  the  city  wants  to  create  as  a  result  of  this  initia- tive. The London Bike App is an example of how both goals of stimulat- ing developers to create innovative apps and improving ease-of-use of  public services can be achieved by open data initiatives and the Enabler  Platform  role  played  by  the  City  of  London.  While  no  particular  mar- ket justification motivation is used by the city and commercial organiza- tions are also welcome to share data in the London Data Store, given the         428  Mobile Electronic Commerce  already public nature of the data, no such motivation is really required  or expected. The developer does not provide adequate data to determine  whether the app can be evaluated as a success, nor is it clear in which  ways the GLA evaluates the London Data Store or has developed metrics  or KPIs that identify whether the initiative has successfully or sufficiently  reached its goals.  20.5.1.3  Discussion  It  is  clear  in  this  case  the  city  plays  a  platform  role,  since  it  mediates  between  at  least  two  sides  of  the  ecosystem:  the  transport  company  and  the  data  it  holds  on  the  one  hand  and  developers  looking  to  cre- ate innovative services on the other. The city remains in control of the  data or infrastructure required to create the value proposition, as shown  by  answering  the  guiding  questions  introduced  earlier:  It  remains  the  owner of the data that is opened up; it provides clear guidelines to devel- opers, stating what use of the data is allowed and goes as far as detail- ing  what  elements  of  the  GUI  should  look  like;  and  the  initiative  and  opening up of data is clearly part of a wider policy approach and is sup- ported by the GLA. The city, however, does not control the service offer- ing that is created as a result of opening up data: The developers involved  are totally external to the organization; the city only has a very limited  amount of control over the final contents of the services, apart from what  is mentioned in the developer guidelines; the city does not have access  to users’ profile or identity information; and no specific quality control  is performed by the city before an app is released. Having control over  the data and infrastructure, but not over the service offering, leads us to  label this case an example of an Enabler City Platform. The case demon- strates how a city can play a facilitating role in an attempt to make sure  developers create applications that have use for citizens and can improve  their quality of life, that is, by increasing accessibility to public transport  information.  Still,  an  important  question  that  remains  with  this  platform  role  is  what  the  return  is  for  the  city  itself.  Other  than  intangible  effects,  the  financial return of simply opening up data is likely to be low, unless close  cooperation with private partners is possible. Thus, another approach an  Enabler City Platform could take is an outsourced model in which the city  does control and provide the relevant assets, but not the service offering,  through close cooperation with a private partner. An example of such col- laboration can be found in the Google Transit service, which is available  on fixed and mobile devices in several major cities around the world. The  service provides the user with a number of public transportation options,  updated  in  real-time  and  placed  on  the  Google  Maps  interface.  Such  a  service is only possible when a city’s public transportation organization         Chapter twenty:  Smart city as a service platform  429  works  closely  together  with  Google  in  integrating  the,  often  different,  technical  backends  and  offering  them  to  the  end  user  in  an  attractive  way. This type of more closed, direct outsourcing of service creation and  provision, while providing the essential raw data, may also constitute an  Enabler City Platform.  Integrator city platform  20.6  In an Integrator City Platform, the city remains in control of both the data  and infrastructure and provides the service offering. To some extent this  is a more closed approach where the city has the highest form of control  on the service development and distribution. In the general description of  this platform type, it is stated that attracting third parties such as devel- opers is encouraged, and this should not be different in the case of city  services. However, when personal data is concerned, it is to be expected  city governments will be more careful in sharing this with third parties.  This means an Integrator City Platform is likely to crystallize in a more  closed  form  than  in  the  general  typology.  It  also  means  the  Integrator  City Platform takes up more roles than was the case in the Enabler model:  It has to manage the relationship with the end user and will, depending  on the specific case, as a result also create, host, and or provide services to  the citizen. This brings with it an increased cost and the use of resources,  which  will  need  to  be  intercepted  by  the  city  government.  In  return,  however, the city gains insight into life in the city and the concerns of its  inhabitants and can perform aggregated statistical analysis on the data it  collects through the integrated service to deal with policy issues it might  want to tackle.  20.6.1  Case: NYC 311 One interesting example, with a very low threshold for citizens, can be  found  in  New  York  City’s  “311”  service.  NYC  311  was  launched  by  the  Bloomberg  administration  in  2003  as  a  centralized  call  center,  tasked  with unifying the nearly 4,000 services offered by over 120 city agencies  and organizations  Accenture, 2011 . The service is a citizen’s first point  of contact with the city government for all questions and issues that are  not  an  emergency   for  which  one  would  call  911  services   and  quickly  became successful. This led to the launch of multiple channels to reach  311, that is, an online portal, a text message service, Skype account, Twitter  account, blog, and iPhone application  Chaudhry, 2011 , all developed as  a direct assignment by the city. Today, the service receives around 50,000  calls a day, serves 8 million citizens and reached the milestone of 100 mil- lion treated calls in May 2010  Johnson, 2010 . While not solely a mobile         430  Mobile Electronic Commerce  offering, NYC 311 offers several functionalities and services related to the  citizen’s location or living environment. The investments in a texting ser- vice, the development of mobile applications, and integration with social  media and data-based communication services  such as Skype, Facebook,  and Twitter  underline this.  20.6.1.1  Control and governance issues  The  mayor’s  office  decided  on  a  hierarchical  approach  and  integrated  value  network  in  the  organizational  structure  of  the  311  service  in  which  the  control  over  assets  of  the  service  is  centralized.  The  ser- vice  is  a  business  unit  of  the  Department  of  Information  Technology  and  Communications   DoITT ,  which  is  headed  by  a  Commissioner,  appointed by the mayor. Day-to-day operations are managed by the 311  Call Center Director, who oversees various staff sublevels. A major con- tribution  to  the  success  of  the  service  appears  to  lie  with  the  role  the  mayor played in unifying the over 45 different call centers of the exist- ing city agencies: He imposed a short, 1-year deadline for the launch of  the  service  and  mandated  that  all  Commissioners  of  existing  agencies  participate in the initiative. Individual agencies were not able to opt-out  of  having  its  services  or  information  handled  by  311   DiGiulio,  2008 .  It is likely to assume this complete and obliged public stakeholder selec- tion is one of the main factors contributing to the success of the service.  The  Department  of  Housing  Preservation  and  Development’s  services  were the first to go live through the 311 system in 2003, with the service  quickly growing to bundle information and services from over 30 city  agencies. A second important characteristic of how 311 works together  with public stakeholders is in its direct interaction with the 59 local rep- resentative bodies known as community boards that represent specific  geographical  areas  of  the  city.  These  boards  play  an  important  role  in  land use and zoning, local services, and the general welfare of their com- munity.  New  York  City’s  311  liaises  with  these  community  boards  on  a  frequent  basis,  to  ensure  that  particular  local  issues  and  complaints  reach the correct city agencies  DiGiulio, 2008 . Furthermore, 311 works  closely with New York City’s HHS-Connect initiative, which integrates  the information systems of the city’s various health and human services  agencies and has begun to introduce links and navigation to state and  federal services  e.g., when a citizen wants to apply for a driver’s license,  he is referred to the DMV, a department that falls under the state’s com- petences   DiGiulio, 2008 .  Aspects related to good governance appear to be an integral part of  New York City’s 311 service as they are in the mission statement of the  call  center  and  online  service.  The  administration  of  mayor  Bloomberg  lists  accessibility,  accountability,  and  transparency  of  city  government  and its services as core principles of an open government  DiGiulio, 2008 ,         Chapter twenty:  Smart city as a service platform  431  concepts  often  used  in  public  governance  literature.  The  city  describes  these principles as follows:     “Accessibility—The 311 Customer Service Center provides residents,  visitors, and inhabitants of the City with one number to call to access  all  New  York  City  government  information  and  services  while,  at  the same time, providing a superior level of customer service. Open  24 h per day, every day of the year, and available in any one of 179  languages, the 311 service connects constituents with the appropri- ate city services and information they have requested—they do not  need  to  know  what  agency  handles  their  request—they  just  need  to know what issue or question they have, and 311 will direct their  inquiry or request to the appropriate party for a response.     Accountability—The 311 Customer Service Center helps City agen- cies  improve  their  delivery  of  services  by  handling  the  customer  service and call center functions of the service delivery process. In  this way, each Agency is able to focus on its core mission and area of  responsibility and manage its workload efficiently.     Transparency—Through  accurate  and  consistent  measurement  and analysis of service delivery, the 311 Customer Service Center  provides  insight  into  ways  in  which  City  government  can  be  improved  and  made  more  efficient.  The  city  uses  data  from  the  311 Customer Service Center along with Business Intelligence tools  and technologies to provide increased visibility into its operations.  Whether  it’s  a  scorecard  indicating  an  agency’s  performance,  or  easily  obtained  information  on  a  service  request  made  through  the  311  center,  this  information  is  conveniently  available  to  all   constituents”  DiGiulio, 2008 .  Not only through the constantly available phone number but also through  the variety of other media the 311 service uses, such as social media and  online  tools,  the  city  government  has  made  a  point  of  being  as  acces- sible as possible. Of course, such availability takes time and comes at a  cost, resulting in a gradual expansion of the number of ways to reach 311   e.g., some mobile platforms like Android do not have an official mobile  application  available  yet .  The  bullet  on  accountability  highlights  how  other government agencies may benefit from the 311 service by being able  to focus more on their core responsibilities, but this works in two direc- tions: The data gathered from the calls and requests coming into 311 may  also bring to light how certain city agencies or organizations have been  less than successful in their core assignments and may resist the notion of  such a service. Additionally, the customer information, which is gathered  by the service  such as people’s phone number and location , places the  relationship with the citizen with 311 as well.        432  Mobile Electronic Commerce  One of the focal points for the service is the high level of customer   service it has aimed to offer since its inception. Added to the three prin- ciples listed earlier, it becomes clear the city set out to achieve a concrete  policy  goal   bundling  and  improving  scattered  existing  city  informa- tion organizations and services  while adhering to some of the principles  essential  in  what  is  understood  as  good  governance  and  following  an  integrated approach when it comes to selecting and managing the stake- holders involved.  As far as technology governance is concerned, it appears the city of  New York makes an effort to be as inclusive as possible toward its citi- zens. The 311 service originated as a phone number, which can be called  free  of  charge,  24 7,  and  today  offers  a  text  messaging  service,  various  social media account, an iPhone application, and is reachable via TTY or  textphone  a device for the hearing-impaired   Chaudhry, 2011 . As far as  the official applications developed by the city of New York are concerned,  there seems to be a focus on iOS development at the time of writing, with  only 2 out of 10 official apps available for both Android and iOS  NYC  Digital, 2012 . There also appears to be some criticism on the stability and  use of the 311 iOS application, even by the mayor himself, as only around  4,000 requests have been made through the app, which was downloaded  23,000 times since its launch in 2009  Tiku, 2012; Weber, 2012 .  One of the most important criticisms on the three core principles dis- cussed earlier is related to transparency and the fact that only a limited  set  of  data  gathered  through  311  is  openly  available  to  developers  and  the public. While the city of New York does operate an open data portal,  NYC DataMine, for a long time only a limited amount of data available  there came from 311. While the DoITT is obliged to distribute monthly  reports  to  the  city  council  and  local  community  boards,  as  well  as  the  public, the data was aggregated and, for example, not machine-readable,  allowing little further analysis or development of new services or visual- izations. This critique was repeated when the city launched a map of 311  requests in February of 2011, but did not provide access to the raw data,  nor the time series of the data giving insight into the evolution of requests  and complaints  Judd, 2011 . Although a data-driven approach was being  pursued in the internal organization of 311  e.g., sharing data and feed- ing results into NYCSTAT, the city’s tool to track and measure data  Beck,  2011   focusing  at  least  on  internal  interoperability  within  the  city’s  ser- vices, or the development of an internal tool able to compile data on calls  received, selected services, open tickets, and the status of requests, this  raw  information  did  not  trickle  through  to  the  public   DiGiulio,  2008 .  At the end of 2011, the city began offering an NYC 311 application pro- gramming interface  API  to give developers quicker and easy access to  the data generated by 311 in JSON and XML format  DuVander, 2011 . This  illustrates that after a period of hesitation on opening up specific datasets         Chapter twenty:  Smart city as a service platform  433  and  a  certain  need  becoming  increasingly  apparent  with  the  public,  as  well as an international move toward open data  see e.g., DiGiulio, 2008 ,  the city of New York has slowly begun adopting an open approach to the  data its services generate.  20.6.1.2  Value and public value issues  As far as financial aspects and the expected return on public investment  is concerned, the main focus of the 311 project seems to lie in customer  satisfaction and offering a high quality of service, rather than expecting  a particular financial return. By consolidating the previously over 40 call  centers, the city was able to reduce the distributed costs of these centers  and was able to operate more cost-effectively, as it had a better overview   DiGiulio, 2008 . In another effort to reduce costs, the city opted for the  multichannel  approach,  which  required  some  initial  investment,  but  is  likely to save a lot of money in the longer term. For example, by offering  the online 311 system where citizens can submit their requests themselves,  some pressure is taken away from the call center, which is constantly see- ing an increased call volume. By letting citizens submit requests them- selves, the call center does not need to hire more staff as requests increase,  keeping costs balanced  DiGiulio, 2008 . As far as the investment structure  is concerned, the service’s operating costs are carried by DoITT, which—as  a mayoral agency—is funded directly by the city budget  DiGiulio, 2008 . The main  somewhat intangible  return for the city is the large set of  data gathered  from the calls and requests coming into 311. By logging,  mapping,  and  tagging  all  requests  coming  into  the  service  via  its  vari- ous channels, the city builds up rich information from which it can distil  trends or structural issues in particular neighborhoods  Johnson, 2010 .  When such trends are identified, policy can quickly be altered or tailored  to the specific needs of that area. The city does not list particular expected  multiplier  effects  in  official  policy  documents,  but  given  the  breadth  of  the service, it is likely to assume some secondary benefits arise as a con- sequence  of  a  more  efficient  handling  of  citizen  requests  and  concerns  by government. For example, it is estimated that because of 311, the bur- den on the 911 emergency call centers has been reduced by 4 million calls  between 2003 and 2009, allowing those centers to operate more efficiently  and to focus more on their core tasks  Accenture, 2010 . Some duplication  of existing services has also been resolved by 311  Accenture, 2010 . Any  financial gains from the service  its revenue model  are thus expected to  be indirect and the result of increases in efficiency.  In  order  to  develop  and  deliver  the  311  service,  the  city  has  set  up  partnerships with various private actors. One of the largest partners in  first  developing  the  call  center,  followed  by  the  online  portal  in  a  later  stage,  is  the  management  consulting  and  technology  service  provider  Accenture. The company was contracted by DoITT to provide technical         434  Mobile Electronic Commerce  architectures, testing and deployment capabilities, the design,  building,  and  implementation  of  the  online  portal,  and  a  large-scale  integration  of  services.  Together  with  the  DoITT,  the  company  built  a  searchable  knowledge base and taxonomy of city, state, and federal services; built a  new, integrated call center operation; and introduced several operational  processes  using  Oracle  Systems  technology  such  as  Siebel  Customer  Relationship  Management  applications  and  content  management  tools  from  Interwoven   Accenture,  2010 .  Additional  partnerships  include  an  outsource vendor who handles overflow calls when the 311 service sees  a peek in calls  e.g., on busy days with extreme weather conditions like  snow or heat , a contract with Language Line, which offers translation and  interpretation services to be able to offer 311 in 179 languages and a close  collaboration with the City University of New York to provide part-time  jobs and internships to over 130 students  DiGiulio, 2008 .  In the framework of the ideas on open data  briefly touched upon ear- lier  and the open source movement, there is some criticism on this form  of contracting between the government and private companies, particu- larly when it comes to the reuse of data. When private companies con- trol the data generated by a particular service, they will be less inclined  to freely open it, but would rather look to sell it  Farley, 2012 . Another  specific  concern  is  revenue-sharing  contracts  that  are  quite  popular  in  city technology services and in which the city pays the supplier a fixed  amount for a product or service, plus a percentage of what the city has as  income over a longer period of time. When the city of Chicago privatized  its parking meters in 2008 as a quick means of dealing with the recession,  it got $1 billion from Morgan Stanley under a revenue-sharing contract.  However, the company estimates making around $11 billion over a longer  period of time, based on the revenue share  Farley, 2012 . As far as the city  of New York is concerned, the spending on private contracts has almost  doubled between 1996 and now, from $5.7 million to $10.5 million, with an  increased focus on technology companies and a limited amount of trans- parency as to how these contracts come about  Farley, 2012 .  Since 2008, 311 organizes a public evaluation of its services. The first  survey showed that citizens were pleased with the service as it scored on  par with the highest ranked private call centers and much  higher than  other government call centers  Chaudhry, 2011 .  A survey at the end  of  2011 showed that customer satisfaction had only increased over the years,  with the remark that more could be done to ensure accessibility for all   Chaudhry,  2011 .  311  also  organizes  an  internal  evaluation  in  the  form  of key performance indicators  KPIs  that need to be met. These mainly  relate  to  the  speed  with  which  calls  are  answered:  90%  of  calls  should  be answered within 30 s, with a maximum answer delay of 3 min  Beck,  2011; DiGiulio, 2008 . Apart from the general satisfaction survey and the  internal KPIs, there is no broader evaluation of the public value generated         Chapter twenty:  Smart city as a service platform  435  by the service and there is apparently no tradition of organizing a public  consultation or test of potential new services by the government.  20.6.1.3  Discussion  The City of New York plays the role of a platform in the sense that it medi- ates between citizens, its various internal organizations and services and  other actors in the city. When looking at the city as a platform in the case  of 311, it becomes clear the city controls both the data and infrastructure  required to create the value proposition as well as the service offering,  meaning we categorize it as an Integrator City Platform. The city contracts  certain technological aspects with large companies  like Accenture and  IBM  and mostly keeps control of the data that is gathered via the service,  allowing the structural analysis of the information that comes in, to adjust  policies.  Although  the  merging  of  the  different  call  centers  and  several  efficiency-increasing exercises has cut costs, running and supporting such  a widely available service is quite cost-intensive for the city government.  Furthermore,  the  city  has  created  an  API  to  open  up  some  of  the  data  gathered via 311, but this means the city remains in control of how data is  opened, under which circumstances and with which limitations. Setting  up 311 was part of a longer-term policy road map to increase QoS to citi- zens, meaning it is not an ad hoc initiative.  The  service  offering  is  also  controlled  by  the  city  as  311  is  clearly  branded and marketed as a city government service and there is no charg- ing or billing relationship as the service is free. General identity informa- tion is used and controlled by the city as well, as a means to improve the  service.  Many  of  the  services  offered  under  the  311  moniker  are  devel- oped either in-house by the city or as a result of direct contracting. The  city controls the contents of the application and when it is not satisfactory,  the developers are called upon to augment the services, as was illustrated  earlier  Tiku, 2012 . NYC311 takes an integrated approach, resulting in a  service of relatively high quality, that is—according to the surveys cited  earlier—appreciated by citizens.  20.7  Neutral city platform In  this  platform  type,  the  city  does  not  control  data  or  infrastructure  assets, nor the service offering. In real life this would crystallize in a city  not  taking  any  particular  initiative  toward  deploying  mobile  services,  leaving  either  private  projects  to  provide  the  tools  available  to  citizens,  with  the  commercial  logic  such  initiatives  in  many  cases  assume,  or  to  more  bottom-up  projects  where  enthusiastic  individuals  or  nonprofit  groups organize themselves to create city-related services. It is of course  a distinct possibility that there is no interest in building out a mobile ser- vice offering at the policy-making level of a metropolitan area or that city         436  Mobile Electronic Commerce  governments feel paralyzed by the fast pace and technical challenges in  the sector. One example of such a neutral platform initiative is the Open  311  set  of  tools  that  are  being  developed  since  2010  and  supported  by  Vivek Kundra, the Chief Information Officer of US Government. Since no  cities are directly involved in the creation of Open 311, it is less relevant to  discuss all the parameters from our framework and so this analysis will  be somewhat limited. However, we will provide a description of the vari- ous aspects of the standard and the stakeholders involved.  20.7.1  Case: Open 311 Open 311 aims to provide a common and open specification to build ser- vices  on  that  allows  citizens  to  report  nonemergency  issues.  The  idea  behind Open 311 is not developing a single API or technology, but rather  providing an open platform  Ashlock, 2009  that allows issue-reporting  services  in  different  cities  to  use  the  same  middleware  layer  to  handle  requests,  before  they  end  up  in  the  city’s  own  issue-tracking  backend  system. By using the Open 311 specification, cities can allow third-party  developers to create 311 services that perhaps use a different approach,  graphical user interface, or visual style than the city’s official application.  It also allows developers to create services for mobile platforms the city is  not present on  in many cases, e.g., Blackberry or Windows Phone , which  can be useful for cities when the cost of developing official applications for  many different mobile operating systems becomes too great. Since Open  311 is being used by more and more US and European cities with issue- reporting services, it also means these applications created by third-party  developers do not have to be linked to one specific city: When Open 311  is used, these services work for all cities that also use the set of standards   mySociety, 2013 .  The idea for the specification first came from the OpenPlans organiza- tion, a nonprofit consisting of several developers and strategic planners,  with  the  goal  of  supporting  cities  in  their  plans  to  improve  communi- cations and relationships with citizens through technology  OpenPlans,  2013 .  The  idea  was  quickly  picked  up  and  further  development  of  the  service is also supported by Code for America, a nonprofit organization  funded by several companies, cities, foundations, and donors. Code for  America brings together developers, city experts, and enthusiasts to sup- port cities to think about innovative services for their citizens  Code for  America, 2012 . The organization was started in 2010 and offers a fellow- ship  program  for  enthusiastic  individuals   developers,  designers,  plan- ners, strategists, etc.  that gives them the chance to work closely together  with  a  city  for  1  year,  on  a  project  they  develop  that  can  help  cities  to  innovate, be more open, increase efficiency, and have impact on society.  Ashlock  2009  was directly involved with the development of Open 311         Chapter twenty:  Smart city as a service platform  437  as a presidential fellow, and continues to push for the implementation of  the specification in as many cities and issue-reporting services as possible.  At  the  time  of  writing  over  30  cities—including  San  Francisco,  Boston,  Baltimore, Washington D.C., and Chicago—supported the Open 311 stan- dard  Open 311, 2013  with many of them encouraging developers to cre- ate  new  applications  for  the  cities’  311  services.  In  Europe,  Open  311  is  supported  by  mySociety,  the  charitable  group  behind  FixMyStreet,  an  issue-reporting service that is available in an increasing number of cities  on and off the continent  mySociety, 2013 .  20.7.1.1  Discussion  The  main  parties  involved  with  creating,  supporting,  and  developing  the Open 311 platform are neutral and nonprofit in nature, with no cit- ies directly involved in their operation. However, Open 311 has a direct  impact  on  individual  cities  in  making  the  311  services  they  offer  more  accessible to citizens through new channels. Open 311 does not control the  service offering to individual citizens, as many people will be unaware of  the platform’s existence and the tools and resources are made available  by the various nonprofits involved. Since Open 311 does not have a direct  relationship with the citizen and gathers different APIs and tools to make  issue-reporting  services  interoperable,  rather  than  directly  manage  any  data or infrastructure, it can be categorized as a Neutral City Platform.  20.8  Broker city platform The Broker City Platform would entail a city has control over the service  offering, but is not in control of the assets required to assemble the value  proposition, that is, the data and infrastructure. In a real-life setting, this  could, for example, mean that the city is involved in some limited service  or application development, but does not have control over the required  data or infrastructure to put together that service.  20.8.1  Case: I Amsterdam QR spots and Amsterdam partners City  marketing  efforts  that  include  the  creation  of  mobile  services  can  serve  as  illustrations  of  a  brokering  role  being  played  by  the  city.  This  strategy  is  clearly  present  in  the  city  of  Amsterdam  where  a  group  of  organizations  have  come  together  under  the  “I  Amsterdam”  label  to  promote the city. The group calls themselves Amsterdam Partners  2011   and consists of governmental, regional, sectorial, and business organiza- tions  responsible  for  the  promotion  and  city  marketing  of  Amsterdam.  These  organizations  provide  the  data  and  tools  needed  to  create  web- sites,  mobile  applications,  organize  events,  advertise,  and  so  on,  under  the “I Amsterdam” moniker, with the goals of promoting the city both         438  Mobile Electronic Commerce  locally and on an international scale. Amsterdam Partners, for example,  created the I Amsterdam QR Spots application for iOS. It was launched in  January 2012 and offers a quite complete touristic and historical guide, the  location of WiFi-hotspots and a QR scanner that allows end users to scan  QR codes posted at diverse important locations in the city. However, the  city itself did not have direct access to or control over the various datasets  and pieces of information required to create the actual service, as it was  distributed among the network of Amsterdam Partners.  20.8.1.1  Control and governance issues  The  control  over  the  data  required  to  create  the  value  proposition  lies  with  Amsterdam  Partners,  a  large  group  of  stakeholders  that  requires  a relatively strong integration of the day-to-day activities, organized by  a  management  board.  A  supervisory  board,  represented  by  the  mayor  of Amsterdam, oversees these activities. Although the approach is inte- grated,  it  does  not  place  all  decision  power  with  the  municipality,  but  rather  focuses  on  clear  rules  and  cooperation.  This  is  described  in  the  policy document detailing the city marketing approach:  Our starting point has been that the city does not  need to manage the entire programme, but should  clearly  guide  a  limited  number  of  key  issues.  The  city also has the task of assisting in the clear divi- sion of tasks and responsibilities to provide a boost  to new issues and in those areas that are forgotten  by others. Organisations involved should have the  encouragement and opportunities to take their own  initiatives but should also know clearly where the  city is heading and what the game rules are. These  rules will be set up cooperatively with companies,  intermediates, the region and partners.  City of Amsterdam  2004, p. 28   Related to the good governance parameter, the main focus in the rheto- ric of Amsterdam Partners seems to be on city marketing and attracting new  businesses and visitors to the city, as well as promoting certain activities or  events more to residents. The application is one tool in reaching the goals that  are set out in the consortium’s annual report  Amsterdam Partners, 2012 :     Optimize the potential of the Amsterdam brand and the Amsterdam   Partners network     Ensure that the “I Amsterdam” motto acquires optimal visibility    Ensure that the “I Amsterdam” motto acquires optimal signiﬁcance        Chapter twenty:  Smart city as a service platform  439  Local government  services  Communication  Economic affairs  Infrastructure and traffic  Port of Amsterdam  Real estate development  Social development  Urban development  Region  Almere Haarlemmermeer Haarlern  Amstelveen  Zaanstad  Supervisory Board Mayor Amsterdam   Chairman   Management Board  Mayor AMA*  Secretary  Member Business Community  Chairman   Chairman Chamber of Commerce   Board member   Alderman Amsterdam   Vice  Chairman   Member Business  Community  Treasurer   Businesses  Advisory board  Sponsors  Convenant Partners  Amsterdam Centre for Architecture  Amsterdam Cruise Port  Amsterdam Cultural institutes  Amsterdam Cultural Ticket Centre  Amsterdam Knowledge Network Foundation  Amsterdam Ports Association  Amsterdam Tourism and convention Board Amsterdam Area development Centre  Topsport Amsterdam  Amsterdam Sports institutes  Figure  20.2  Overview  of  the  Amsterdam  Partners  organization.

These three aims are interesting as they clearly illustrate the intention of  the city to establish the direct relationship and interaction with the citizen,  through the concerted city marketing effort. The stakeholders involved are  organized in an interesting construction that brings together diverse actors  in the city that could benefit from an optimized city brand. The main orga- nization  involved  in  the  development  of  this  application  is  Amsterdam  Partners. This PPP-construction  see following text  brings together local  government entities, businesses active in the city, local organizations, and  representations of the cities surrounding Amsterdam. The organizations  involved are represented in the Figure 20.2  Iamsterdam, 2012 .  These organizations are brought together under a management board  and supervisory board, chaired by the mayor of Amsterdam. This even  visually illustrates the brokering role the city of Amsterdam and the office  of the mayor take up in the city’s marketing plans, by mediating between  many different types of organizations. Additionally, Amsterdam Partners  works closely together with other Amsterdam organizations such as the  Amsterdam  Tourism  and  Convention  Bureau   ATCB ,  the  Amsterdam  Uitburo   AUB   and  Amsterdam  in  Business   AIB .  These  organiza- tions gear all their activities to one another and present it to the public  under the “I Amsterdam” moniker, which was launched on September  23, 2004. To further increase cooperation, these organizations have been  merged  during  2012  and  started  activities  as  a  single  legal  entity  from         440  Mobile Electronic Commerce  January  1,  2013,  onward   Amsterdam  Partners,  2012 .  The  main  stake- holders  involved  in  the  development  of  this  specific  mobile  application  were the City of Amsterdam Economic Affairs, the Amsterdam Bureau  of Monuments & Archeology, the City Archive and the ATCB. One hun- dred and thirty-nine signs made out of traditional Amsterdam ceramics,  containing a short explanation in Dutch and English as well as the QR  code, have been placed along important monuments or areas of the city  and its surrounding neighborhoods. A Dutch advertising company called  Beedesign  was  responsible  for  the  fixtures  and  placement  of  the  signs,  which were designed and developed by  van Dijk, 2011 .  The data and information that is presented to end users in the service  offering is not open and provided by the partnering organizations in the  I  Amsterdam  consortium:  In  this  specific  case,  mainly  the  Amsterdam  Bureau of Monuments & Archeology and the City Archive. Although the  information  may  be  publicly  available  from  other  sources,  it  is  not  the  result  of  an  open  data  initiative   although  the  city  of  Amsterdam  does  have one  and does not foresee interoperability with other services. The  application itself is developed and supported by XS2TheWorld, a Dutch  internet company with international branches that has international com- panies such as McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Sanoma, and Porsche as its clients.  The developer was contracted by Amsterdam Partners to create and pro- vide support for the I Amsterdam QR Spots service.  20.8.1.2  Value and public value issues  The  main  investment  for  the  operations  of  Amsterdam  Partners  comes  from  the  city  of  Amsterdam,  its  surrounding  municipalities  and  contri- butions  from  industry  partners.  In  2011,  Amsterdam  Partners  received  almost €1.4 million in grants and contributions, combined with just under  €150,000 in revenues from other sources such as retail of merchandise and  interest, bringing the total budget of the organization to €1,528,286 in 2011,  a slight decrease compared with €1,707,742 in 2010  Amsterdam Partners,  2012 . No further detail is available and it is unclear how much was needed  for the development of the application and the placement of the QR codes  around the city. The application itself does not have a revenue model as  it is offered for free to end users by the city of Amsterdam. Although the  expected returns are not directly financial, they are certainly defined as  indirect commercial or economic indicators, mainly related to an increased  use of city products and services by visitors and residents. This is expressed  in the goals Amsterdam Partners sets: Investments in the Amsterdam brand  effectively translate to positive results in numerous fields including revenue, visitor  numbers, investments, image and global market position. In turn, this will result  in  an  economically,  socially  and  culturally  stronger  Amsterdam   Amsterdam  Partners,  2012 .  Amsterdam  Partners  describes  itself  as  a  public–private  foundation, but its legal status, details of the cooperation and how finances         Chapter twenty:  Smart city as a service platform  441  exactly flow between the partners remains unclear at the time of writing  and  would  need  to  be  detailed  in  further  research.  The  service  is  posi- tioned according to the philosophy of the I Amsterdam project and its tar- get audience is summarized in the annual report as:     International business world  decision makers     Visitors  tourists and business people     Residents   the  bearers  of  the  motto  and  ambassadors  of  the   Amsterdam Metropolitan Area   Amsterdam Partners, 2012   There is a very limited aspect of user involvement present in the applica- tion as end users can scan the QR codes to receive additional information  on a certain location. However, the application is also usable and provides  the same information without making use of this functionality. There is  thus a gimmick aspect to this part of the service, although the presence of  the QR codes in the city infrastructure may inspire visitors and citizens  to make use of the application more. The intended value of the service is  explicitly focused on disclosing the historical background of certain areas  of the city and specific landmarks, as well as tips on restaurants, bars, or  other experiences in the end user’s area:  Visitors with a smartphone can scan the QR code to  reveal  additional  information  about  each  location,  including  background  stories,  little-known  secrets,  historical  photos  or  pictures  of  the  interiors.  Based  on your current location, you can also get tips about  other points of interest in the neighbourhood. There  are no fixed routes—instead, you can explore sections  of the city at your own pace, based on your interests. I Amsterdam  2012   The  popularity  of  the  I  Amsterdam  QR  Spots  applications  is  hard  to  measure,  given  its  relatively  young  nature  and  the  fact  that  the  iTunes  App  Store  does  not  provide  measurements  to  the  public.  The  two  pre- vious apps developed for I Amsterdam  a full touristic guide including  similar  information  and  a  light  version  that  consumes  less  data   were  already included in the 2011 Annual Report of Amsterdam Partners and  were downloaded 120,000 and 60,000, respectively  Amsterdam Partners,  2012 . Although the services are briefly evaluated in the annual report of  Amsterdam  Partners,  the  expected  returns  and  generated  public  value  appear to be quite vague and are referred to as increasing the visibility of  the city and its promotion. Hence, it is hard to judge whether the mobile  applications contribute to this and to what extent.        442  Mobile Electronic Commerce  20.8.1.3  Discussion  Given  the  strong  focus  on  city  marketing,  the  Amsterdam  Partners   and  thus the city  puts forward, the platform role played by the city is that of a  broker. The assets required to compose the value proposition are distributed  among the many partners of the city and brought together in the Amsterdam  Partners consortium, whose long-term interests are commercial in nature.  The data required to put together the service is not directly under the con- trol of the city’s central administration, as it is owned and provided by the  Amsterdam Bureau of Monuments & Archeology and the City Archive. The  data  is  not  openly  available  and  so  no  particular  license  is  available,  nor  an API. Control over infrastructure is also distributed as in some cases the  monuments involved are owned by the city and private property in others.  The I Amsterdam initiative is a large part of the city’s policy plans related to  city marketing, and the mobile application is a very small part of that.  There is a strong emphasis on the branding and promotion of the city,  meaning that the city uses different types of service offerings to create a  strong relationship with citizens, of which the mobile app under discus- sion here is one. The city has control over the service offering as it is devel- oped under a direct assignment by an external developer and does impact  the content of the service to some extent since it is determined and pro- vided by partners in the Amsterdam Partners network. A form of quality  control is present to make sure the I Amsterdam brand is represented in a  positive and consistent manner.  20.9  City platform typology The following table provides an updated view of the platform typology to  address the elements particular to the context of the city that were identi- fied  and  illustrated  by  the  case  studies  provided  earlier.  The  definitions  used in the general platform typology remain valid, but are not repeated  here. This typology can be a first step in thinking about the position a city  government wants to take in mobile service creation and provision. Briefly  returning to the definition of Smart Cities that was proposed earlier on,  and the different domains the concept may refer to, we see that the ser- vices created based on the city platform described earlier indeed address  many of the issues important for the advancement of the Smart Cities con- cept. Innovative environmental services, new approaches to mobility and  public transportation, increased government efficiency, etc., are domains  in which mobile city services have already been  effective. Nurturing and  fostering these initiatives into fully operational platforms can thus be one  way for a city government to build out its Smart City strategy, if such poli- cies are within the scope of a city’s priorities. Important to note here, and in  line with the criticism formulated on the Smart City  concept, such services         Chapter twenty:  Smart city as a service platform  443  Control over data  and or infrastructure  No control over data  and or infrastructure  Table 20.2  City Platform Typology  No control over service   Control over service   offering   offering   Enabler city platform Facilitating city services.  Can be open data initiatives  or outsourcing of service  creation based on provided  datasets. Stimulating  development is key. Example: London Data Store,  Google Transit Neutral city platform Commercial, nonprofit, or  crowdsourced city services.  City government does not  take initiative and relies on  privately funded or  bottom-up projects. Example: Open 311   Integrator city platform Governmental city  services. Somewhat  more closed approach,  can be high-cost  depending on  implementation. Example: NYC311  Broker city platform City-branded services.  More of a distributed  effort, for example,  aimed at city  marketing, rather than  direct service provision. Example: Amsterdam  Partners  should make all efforts to be as inclusive as possible and thus not be limited  to  certain  technological platforms  e.g., more  expensive  and complicated  smartphone  devices ,  but  attempting  to  cater  to  the  diverse  population  inhabiting a region  e.g., by also offering services via voice or SMS .  These four different platform types clearly run along the same prin- ciples as the initial mobile services typology. However, these city platform  types operate on a different level and scale and are more related to how  public entities can organize themselves to make new and appealing ser- vices offerings for citizens possible. In this sense, it should be interesting  to see to what extent these platform types can also be applied to other  types of services than mobile only. Initially, it would appear this frame- work could also be used to assess other digital services offered by cities   e.g., in the case of open data initiatives or that of city marketing, as was  illustrated in two cases earlier , but this would have to be the subject of  further work  Table 20.2 .  20.10  Conclusion The  goal  of  this  chapter  was  to  verify  whether  a  general  typology  for  mobile service platforms would hold up to scrutiny in the more applied  and specific context of the city and to what extent city agencies could take         444  Mobile Electronic Commerce  up platform roles within the value network. After sketching the context  of the city and the business model implications it brings to the creation  and delivery of mobile services, the chapter described in more detail how  the control parameters can be interpreted in this application of the typol- ogy. Next, several cases were presented for the four city platform types.  We can clearly identify platform roles that are being taken up by cities  internationally. These different roles have their own merits and conse- quences  that  depend  on  the  relationship  the  city  has  with  its  citizens   via the service offering  and the data or infrastructure it controls. The  thorough  case  studies  showed  the  different  possible  approaches  cities  can take: play a facilitating role by providing developers with data, tools,  and  resources  in  the  case  of  the  enabler  platform,  keep  tighter  control  over the service in an effort to increase QoS in the integrator platform,  rely on the initiative of commercial or nonprofit entities that can play a  supporting role for cities in the neutral platform, or focus solely on com- munication with the citizen by focusing on city marketing in the broker  platform type. This typology can be an initial tool for city governments  to  consider  their  own  role  within  the  value  network  and  expose  the  potential platform dynamics at play when they are involved in mobile  service provision.  Future  research  will  build  on  the  concepts  presented  in  this  chap- ter  and  establish  whether  there  are  crucial  gatekeeping  platform  roles  at play in the creation and provision of mobile services in the context of  the city. An even clearer definition of what control over assets and cus- tomers means in this context is required, while developing more applied  enabling and constraining factors, as well as policy recommendations city  governments can go to work with, toward providing compelling mobile  city services.

The most publicized feature of the new  iPhone and operating system  OS  was Apple Maps  AM . Apple had long  been concerned that Google Maps  GM  was used habitually and exclu- sively  by  most  iPhone  and  iPad  users  to  generate  maps,  view  imagery,  search for points of interest  POI , and generally navigate through their  lives. The loss to Apple of data about location-based searches  e.g., where  is  the  nearest  café   and  control  over  spatial  content   e.g.,  locations  and  attributes of gas stations in a particular town  and advertising revenues  to  rival  Google  was  deemed  a  strategic  danger.  Apple’s  acquisitions  of  Tom Tom, Intermap, Digital Globe, Urban Mapping, and Waze data and  ownership interests in Yelp, Placebase, Locationary, and C3 Technologies  paved the way for Apple to challenge GM  Forbes, 2012 . To deter iPhone  users from using GM, Apple replaced it with AM  for users who upgraded  their iPhones or OS . This change was a shock for millions of iPhone users  who  tried  to  engage  with  location-based  services  or  simply  view  and  query  locations.  Although  AM  did  offer  users  turn-by-turn  directions,   449   450  Mobile Electronic Commerce  these were no better than those available on vehicle navigation systems.  The new 3D feature was a source of derisive comment due to distortions  of features, notably many iconic bridges  like the Brooklyn Bridge  and  monuments  like the Eiffel Tower . The most visible distortion was that  the  feature  appeared  to  be  melting  into  the  lower  elevation  surround- ings   such  as  the  river .  In  other  cases,  cars  appeared  to  be  driving  up  the side of buildings or ships sailing up the side of bridges. The cause of  these issues were problems with the draping algorithm developed by C3  Technologies  Schmidt, 2012 .  The release of AM generated instant ridicule in cyberspace, negative  comments in mainstream media, critical reviews by pundits, and a down- grade of Apple prospects by financial analysts  CNN, 2012a,b . There were  a vast number of errors in the names and locations of features, but the  most prominently reported errors involved public facilities, such as train  stations, bridges, airports, subway entrances, parks, and zoos. These were  either placed in the wrong location or misnamed. This was largely due  to  Yelp  data  being  focused  on  rating  commercial  POI  data   i.e.,  restau- rants, dentists  and Tom Tom data being originally intended for a vehi- cle navigation system and hence mostly oriented toward linear features   i.e.,  streets   that  vehicles  could  drive  on.  When  Apple  users  compared  AM with GM and Microsoft’s Bing Maps  BM , AM generally came in last  in accuracy. The navigation feature, which was basically Tom Tom data  and algorithms, was in many places inferior to competing vehicle naviga- tion systems from Garmin using Navteq data  Navteq, 2013 . Of course it  did allow users to use a smartphone to replace a navigation system which  was convenient.  Apple’s unique 3D feature, which was designed to give AM a competi- tive advantage, generated bizarre images of melting bridges, spike islands,  black holes, and low-resolution imagery that circulated actively on social  and broadcast media. Apple intended AM to be a GM killer application.  Within months, much of the user base had rejected and ridiculed AM. The  Huffington Post’s Wall Street 24 7 site ranked AM as the worst new product  flop of 2012  Huffington Post Business, 2013 . Within 10 days of AM launch,  Apple’s CEO Tim Cook made a formal apology in an open letter to the  public stating that “While we’re improving Maps, you can try alternatives  by downloading map apps from the App Store like Bing, MapQuest and  Waze, or use Google or Nokia maps…”. This last alternative, at the time,  required users to download Google Chrome and use Safari as a search  engine, which a few users did, but the process was complicated. The AM  debacle was followed within 3 months by the firing of the three senior  Apple  executives  most  visibly  and  directly  involved.  Many  analysts,  Apple users and staff inside Apple stated, “Steve Jobs would never have  allowed this to happen” because he always wanted to “grock”  his term for  thoroughly understanding  an issue. However, corporate decisions made         Chapter twenty-one:  Strategic and tactical issues  451  during Steve Jobs tenure as CEO  i.e., not to pursue  geospatial technolo- gies in contrast to competitors Google and Microsoft  meant that Apple  had positioned itself for a troubled AM introduction  Isaacson, 2011 . The  question asked by many loyal users and followers of Apple is “How could  Apple get it so wrong?”  Issues with Apple maps  21.2  Some of the issues bedeviling the AM rollout were inevitable, and would  have been present with any effort to create worldwide high-quality geo- spatial data for a wide range of applications important to m-commerce   e.g., POI and turn-by-turn navigation of a network of street centerlines .  However, other problems were largely self-inflicted. The most prominent  of the self-inflicted issues was the 3D feature. The 3D view was designed  to be more impressive than anything competitors, such as GM  with their  “Google Earth,” “Bird’s Eye View,” and “Streetview”  or BM could offer.  While there are undoubtedly many tens of thousands of erroneous  features  and  incorrectly  associated  attributes  that  are  relatively  trivial   such as “Lowry Lane” being called “Lowry Road”  among the billions  of accurate features in AM’s worldwide geospatial data set, some of the  errors are more significant and attracted multiple repostings from users  in cyberspace and were aired in online and broadcast media. The single  most  publicized  type  of  error  was  the  melting  bridge.  This  was  an  error  associated with draping imagery over a 3D model of terrain. Actually, the  algorithm  was  developed  and  patented  by  C3  Technologies  of  Sweden,  now acquired by Apple. It is a mesh fishnet surface used in the draping  algorithm, so technically it is not a true 3D model but a 2.5-dimensional  one.  According  to  Ryan  Schmidt,  a  leading  expert  on  draping  imagery  over  3D  surfaces  and  terrain  who  is  employed  as  a  senior  scientist  by  Autodesk,  Inc.,  “the  underlying  algorithms  produce  a  set  of  3D  points,  and the surface you see is a smooth interpolated surface through those  3D points.” “The texture is then projected onto this smooth 3D surface.”  “If not enough points are produced, then the result is going to be over- smoothed…the  algorithms  work  better  with  a  large  number  of  high- resolution photos taken from many viewpoints around the 3D feature.”  “Some things are just inherently hard to reconstruct this way, because the  small repetitive details in the images confuse the image-feature matching  process.” Bridges in particular have that characteristic. To avoid generat- ing melting bridges and other anomalies, the 3D maps must be carefully  edited. Google has done a lot of this tedious work but it also has a few  issues of the same sort as seen in AM, for example, with bridge approach  ramps  Schmidt, 2013 .  Melting  bridges  rapidly  became  the  signature  of  AM’s  problems.  Although  Brooklyn  Bridge  in  New  York  is  the  most  notable,  the  Lions         452  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Gate  Bridge  in  Vancouver,  British  Colombia  suffered  a  more  dramatic   distortion. It not only appeared to be melting, but a barge was shown sail- ing up one side of a triangular face while cars drove on the other face at  an impossible angle. This bridge was also mislabeled with an old high- way designation changed decades previously. Other bridges with issues  include the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, the Mackinac Bridge, and the bridge  below  Niagara  Falls  on  the  US–Canadian  border  as  well  as  bridges  in  Quebec, England, Germany, and Australia that appear to be melting into  the waters below them.  How  the  melting  bridge  phenomena  could  have  missed  developers  beta testing is astounding. Though the Hoover Dam itself is well imaged,  the bridge at Hoover Dam was not there when C3 Technologies featured  it  in  a  product  demo  video  back  in  2009.  Thus,  C3  Technologies  may  not have updated the imagery in tests and run out new imagery show- ing  the  drooping  bridge  without  adequate  quality  control  checks   C3  Technologies, 2011 . This rationale does not explain the melting Brooklyn  Bridge, which has been there since 1883. Another potential explanation  comes  from  the  corporate  history  of  C3  Technologies.  It  was  a  division  of Sweden’s SAAB and its owners were eager to spin off this subsidiary  because the parent company, General Motors, had filed for bankruptcy.  Apple reportedly paid the equivalent of $700 million for C3 Technologies   Wall  Street  Journal,  2009 .  In  reality,  the  3D  maps  did  not  add  any  sig- nificant value over ordinary aerial imagery in the form of improved user  understanding or experience. This is partly because the world is generally  rather flat  i.e., seen in 2D . Draping imagery on the sides of buildings in  urban areas does not do much to improve navigation in an urban envi- ronment once the initial wow factor has passed  Paar, 2006 . Users do not  need  to  see  imagery  draped  across  terrain  to  make  informed  decisions  about  which  turn  to  take  on  their  journey  or  where  to  go  to  purchase  products.  In  fact,  the  application  had  a  tendency  to  make  users  physi- cally sick due to vertigo  The Guardian, 2013 . Oddly, not all bridges in the  3D maps melted. Noticeable, the Bay Bridge and Golden Gate Bridge in  Apple’s home turf were not melted, nor were quite a number of bridges in  Sweden. Developers likely made sure the 3D application worked well in  demos presented to Apple executives featuring places familiar to them in  their daily travel route to and from Cupertino, California  YouTube, 2011 .  It is probably true that top Apple executives were genuinely unaware of  the melting bridge problem or that it was widespread. The draping algo- rithm also had other glitches such as areas where no imagery was avail- able and thus black holes appeared or where the underlying fishnet mesh  peaked through gaps. Frequently, the digital elevation model was out of  sync with the imagery, and this created anomalous spike islands.  In reality, imagery can never be entirely up-to-date. The satellite sys- tems  that  gather  imagery  can  only  pass  over  a  given  spot  on  the  earth         Chapter twenty-one:  Strategic and tactical issues  453  every  16–21  days.  Depending  on  the  system,  processing  of  imagery  requires  orthorectification   i.e.,  aerial  photographs  that  are  geometrically  corrected and scaled  and georeferencing  i.e., establishing location using  coordinate systems   Rees, 2001 . Nevertheless, the imagery used to sup- port the rollout of AM fell far short of the high standard that BM and GM  had established in the minds of users. Specifically, the AM imagery for  Davos, Switzerland  home to the World Economic Forum , was not only  outdated and of low resolution, but it also represented three distinct sea- sons simultaneously.  Some AM imagery was at such a low resolution that only very gen- eral building outlines were visible. In contrast, GM accesses Digital Globe  imagery at 0.41 m resolution, which has over 5300 times more information  content than 30 m imagery used for some areas in AM. The m-commerce  implications of low-resolution imagery are also important. With 30 m res- olution  imagery,  individual  businesses,  even  the  largest  big  box  retailer,  are difficult to resolve. While in 0.41 m resolution imagery, each business  location  is  easy  to  discern.  There  are  several  areas  with  low-resolution  imagery in AM including the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, and Cuba. AM imagery that was only available in black and white was present  in areas of Australia, Albania, Germany, Italy, and Croatia. It appears that  color imagery was obtained by Apple, but a processing error was made  and only a single band of multispectral imagery was used. This is an error  typical of image-processing neophytes and one that is glaringly obvious  and easy to rectify  Lemeshewsky, 2004 .  A  grayscale-only  image,  due  to  a  different  cause,  showed  up  for  Colchester,  England   population  104,390 .  A  large  cumulonimbus  cloud  covered  the  entire  urban  area.  The  label   which  is  a  separate  layer  of  data  in  AM   was  located  in  the  right  spot,  but  the  whole  of  Colchester  was under an off-white cloud. As a practical issue, users could still find  Colchester and when zoomed in on the image see labeled streets, but the  whole area appeared white  the color of the top of the cloud . While find- ing a cloud-free day in the Highlands of New Guinea or the Costa Rican  cloud forest is a challenge, in most parts of the world it is readily available  at some time every year. This image did not meet an acceptable standard  for an area as developed as England. Similar issues impacted Red Square  in Moscow, a town in Germany, and many parts of the Scottish Highlands   which are indeed rather dreary .  A  type  of  imagery-related  error  with  important  consequence  for  m-commerce was present in the case of the Yummy Foods Store on Santa  Monica Avenue in Los Angeles. This natural food store was  portrayed  in AM in the correct location; its listing had a number of positive Yelp  reviews associated with it, the turn-by-turn navigation to it was correct,  but  the  imagery  showed  not  a  store  but  a  large  hole  in  the  ground  at  that location. Although the imagery was in color and was high enough         454  Mobile Electronic Commerce  resolution to show a wheelbarrow, it was local municipal government   aerial photography that was several years out of date. This brings to the  forefront  another  significant  issue.  That  is,  the  recent  financial  crisis  impacted the ability of many local governments to conduct aerial pho- tography in their regions as often as some users would like  Huffington  Post,  2013 .  This  sort  of  error  is  always  possible  for  construction  that  involves more than merely reusing an existing building but in its demo- lition. It may also happen in the aftermath of a fire or natural disaster.  Since natural disasters, like super-storm Sandy, often trigger subsidized  aerial  photography  efforts,  developers  of  imagery  used  in  mapping  applications have to be judicious in not always replacing existing imag- ery with newer imagery even if it is higher resolution, since a POI for a  business location may be on top of a temporary burnt-out or washed- away building or hole in the ground.  The process for updating POI data relies on not only teams in the field  working for geospatial companies but also the firms whose units are to  be located themselves  Tom Tom, 2013 . For example, Royal Dutch Shell,  Best Western Motels, and Ace Hardware all have internal teams building  geospatial data, as do smaller firms with fewer units  Leipnik and Mehta,  2004 . Unfortunately, not all firms are technological savvy enough to get  their location data into all the geospatial data bases that are being con- structed. These at a minimum include Apple, Google, Bing, MapQuest,  Yahoo Maps, and Multi-map in the United Kingdom and affiliated com- panies Navteq and Tom Tom.  While existing businesses may have a real interest in updating POI  data, the same cannot be said of businesses that have ceased operations.  This  fact  is  reflected  in  AM,  which  has  approximately  800  POI’s  for  all  the  “Woolworth”  units  in  the  United  Kingdom,  even  though  the  dis- counter closed all stores in 2002. Even more surprisingly, AM had POI’s  for approximately 200 units of “Our Price,” a chain of deep discounters.  This firm ceased operation in 1989, which is 3 years before Tom Tom began  operations.  From  a  marketing  perspective,  it  is  more  damaging  to  not  have data for an existing unit, but keeping defunct businesses on the map  is an error nevertheless and one that will not be resolved after the fact by  the firm in question.  A much more serious deficiency of AM is illustrated by the case of the  Pepper School of Music in San Antonio, Texas. As soon as AM replaced  GM, the owner of this small business began receiving calls from clients  that could not locate his school on Apple devices. He found that in AM,  the school’s location was off by about 10 blocks and in the middle of a resi- dential area rather than on the arterial street where he operated. He had  to verbally explain to clients how to extricate themselves from a tangle of  cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets. To add insult to injury, his location was  correctly mapped in GM, BM, and MapQuest. Mr. Pepper made repeated         Chapter twenty-one:  Strategic and tactical issues  455  efforts to correct his location, contacting first Apple who referred him to  Tom Tom who in turn suggested Yelp. He also tried Locationary  a map- ping data company owned by Apple , but to no avail. Of late, Apple has  tried to improve its POI data by acquiring HotSpot and also has begun to  solicit input from small business owners.  The lack of a mechanism, at the time of initial release of data, to report  and correct errors in AM data, was probably the second most profound  mistake  after the 3D mapping errors  made by Apple. This was due to the  fact that Apple had acquired the rights to use all Tom Tom data in 2011  but  was  negotiating  to  actually  purchase  the  firm  as  late  as  September  2013   Forbes,  2012 .  Each  firm  seemed  to  blame  the  other  and  Apple’s  Vice President for Retail, Jerry McDougal, was initially not responsive to  calls for Apple to take responsibility for erroneous data. He stated that  AM were “good and would get better.” What mechanism would rapidly  improve  AM,  without  a  mechanism  for  continuous  consumer  feedback  is  unclear.  It  is  noteworthy  that  Google  has  long  encouraged  feedback  on errors in its geospatial data and makes a simple GIS program called  Mapmaker freely available to users who want to try their hand at editing  and updating maps and submitting those results for possible inclusion in  revised Google offerings  Google, 2013 .  The iPhones use a combination of GPS, cellular tower signal triangu- lation, and Wi-Fi to help determine location. In some cases, such as when  the device is inside a structure, GPS does not work because the signal is  blocked by a structural component. There are cases where the IP address  of the Wi-Fi router is set someplace else and the physical location of the  device is not the same as the past physical location of the router. This has  caused  some  users  of  iOS  6  and  iOS  7  devices,  when  at  home,  to  have  their home locations appear a large distance away from where they actu- ally are. This makes it impossible for them to use the navigation feature  from their home. In many cases, when they manually enter their home  address, they find this is in the wrong location as well. It may be interpo- lated based on incorrect address ranges or in the case where the address  is a P.O. box or rural delivery route, it will not have any corresponding  physical address nearby. This is an issue for all cellular devices, not just  iPhones, but the Tom Tom data used in AM is more error prone than GM  or BM data, at least in the United States.  AM use of Tom Tom data supplemented with Yelp data to create infor- mation  on  POIs  is  quite  limited.  For  example,  Yelp  uses  a  hierarchical  algorithm, so it lists restaurants 1st, public facilities 6th, and schools 12th.  A test was done  by the authors  of the Yelp listings in Huntsville, Texas.  It  indicated  that  there  was  only  one  bar   with  one  review ,  when  there  are over a dozen bars. A search for “Scott Johnson Elementary School”   in  operation  at  the  same  location  since  1962   returned  “Specs  Liquor  Warehouse.” “Sam Houston State University  SHSU ; enrollment 20,000;         456  Mobile Electronic Commerce  founded in 1879 ” was not listed at all, but Yelp suggested that both Lone  Star College and Sam’s Deli in Houston, Texas  which was 80 miles away   as possible substitutes. Conversely, Tom Tom data places SHSU at the cor- rect location, but its attribute data  when accessed with a GIS program   indicates it is located in Phelps, Texas  a town of only 100 people located  more  than  20  miles  to  the  South  East  of  Huntsville .  This  is  typical  of  the deficiencies of AM data with respect to universities and other public  not-for-profit  entities.  It  is  because  they  are  not  typical  businesses  and  so do not have the same set of attributes nor do they contact firms like  Tom  Tom  with  their  data.  Even  when  a  university  is  mapped  correctly  in AM, the buildings inside the campus are not mapped in most cases   e.g., Louisiana State University appears as an empty space on AM . This  is in contrast to GM, which generally have the buildings inside campus  identified. Given that a high proportion of college students are incessant  users of smartphones, with a disproportionate share using Apple devices,  ignoring  the  on-campus  way  finding  needs  of  this  segment  is  hard  to  justify or understand. The Yelp coverage of other public facilities is also  meager, in particular coverage of public transportation routes  e.g., bus  stops  is basically lacking.  The ratings in Yelp are problematic as well. Zagat or Michelin ratings  are generated by mystery shoppers  i.e., real diners and buyers  and part of  Navteq’s offerings and available on Garmin GPS devices. In contrast, on  Apple devices, the ratings from Yelp rely on the user community  which is  anyone that cares to join the site . Few restaurants receive more than 20 rat- ings and the immediate family and friends of the owners of any restaurant  can join Yelp and serve as shills to submit numerous highly favorable rat- ings. The arithmetic average of 18 spurious ratings and 2 genuine ones will  still be a high rating. In fact, most restaurants in AM have uniformly high  ratings. This fact defeats the purpose of the ratings  Main Street, 2011 .  Although Yelp data is more complete in California and New York City  than for example in Texas, it is out of date and misleading there as well.  For example, of the four restaurants closed by the Orange County Health  Department in 2012, two were listed in September 2013 on Yelp as open  and both had four out of five star ratings. In the case of one other closed  restaurant, Yelp found a dentist, of the same name, in a nearby city as a not  very helpful alternative. Yelp depends on the business continuing to oper- ate or be superseded by an operational business. New stores, bars, and  restaurants depend on active Yelp users to give them ratings. While some  segments of the population in some regions of the United States are eager  to give ratings, many are not, and few businesses outside the United States  are even rated. More fundamentally, many of the patrons with the most  disposable income may be too occupied with professional and personal  interests to take the time to post a rating.        Chapter twenty-one:  Strategic and tactical issues  457  Apple describes AM on its official site as a new turn; unfortunately,  they often provide users a wrong turn  Apple, 2013 . Tom Tom has data for  the  United  States,  Canada,  Mexico,  and  the  European  Union   EU ,  that  it claims is 99% complete. But it does not include Croatia, which is now  a member of the EU. Additionally, Japan is excluded from having com- plete road data and so are China and India along  with  the two largest  European countries, Russia and Ukraine. All of these nations are at best  poorly mapped in Tom Tom data and by extension very likely to be badly  mapped in AM. In some countries, AM data is almost absent, such as in  Belarus and Grenada. For many nations, all the data in AM is basically  data mapped by the Defense Mapping Agency in the 1980s  vector data  that is publicly available for free download . This is a highly generalized  one-to-one million scale Digital Chart of the World data set  now called  VMAP 0  and consists of major roads and points representing inhabited  places.  In  many  nations,  particularly  in  Africa,  it  is  all  that  AM  has  to  offer besides imagery. Effectively, it is the lowest common denominator  for international geospatial data  NGA, 2013 .  21.3  Types of errors Tom Tom data available in AM is subject to a wide range of errors. The  most common being incorrect definition of city limits, inaccurate speeds  associated with roads, wrong road type, not including the correct name  for  a  road  with  multiple  alternative  names  and or  numbers,  failure  to  show a road at all, and connecting roads to each other that do not connect.  Transposing road names is one type of error that is rare but very confus- ing and hard for users to resolve. A more common error is calling a street  an avenue,  a drive, or a road. More significant is mapping a section of the  Interstate with the incorrect name of a surface street. For example, part of  Interstate 45 in Huntsville, Texas is incorrectly named Green Briar Drive   the real “Greenbrier Drive” is 2 miles away .  A  surprisingly  common  error  in  AM  is  portraying  a  road  as  exist- ing, when it does not exist. This error can have three main sources: one is  showing a road that once existed but is now abandoned, another is por- traying a road that was once planned and laid out on maps but never con- structed, and another is due to misidentification of utility right of ways,  bridal paths, or fire breaks as roads. A related issue is the long private  driveways on farms and ranches that are misidentified as public roads.  They may or may not be closed off by entry gates, but driving on them is  trespassing and likely unlawful. The most defensible type of error is the  case where a road is under construction or reconstruction and shown as  through. This type of error is a temporary one, although the alignment  shown on the map may not be the ultimate alignment.        458  Mobile Electronic Commerce  One facet of AM data is the option to receive real-time traffic updates.  This will help with detours and road construction issues, although it does  not  resolve  the  countless  other  errors  and  issues  with  AM  street  data.  Generally,  only  driving  roads  actively  with  numerous  data  collection  vehicles, diligent digitizing, constant editing with frequent reference to  aerial imagery, and being responsive to user comments can help resolve  these problems and update the street data to reflect constant changes.  There is a large category of errors where the street name is incorrect; this  can include misspellings such as “Warner Road” instead of “Werner Road”  or “Lowry Road” instead of “Lowry Lane” or “Palaside Circle” instead of  “Palisade Circle”  all occur in Walker County, TX . Or the rarer, but humor- ous examples, where “Carse Road” in Vermont became “Curse Road” or  where “Satinwood Drive” in Maryland was altered to “Satanwood Drive.”  The street direction also can be in error and often the address range can be  wrong, as can the speed limit. If the speed limit is incorrect, then the algo- rithm to determine the shortest travel time through several potential routes  will often produce errors. Generally, the further back in the name the mis- spelling has taken place, the less significant it is. Erroneously, naming the  midsized town of “Slaithwaite” in the United Kingdom as “Blaithwaite” is  a more serious error than misspelling the last letter of the name of a street.  Misspelling the first letter in a name makes online searches much more  difficult.  For  example, having “Slaithwaite”  named  as  “Blaithwaite” is a  more significant error than spelling it “Slaithwait” or “Slaithwaitee.” The  fact that there is another nearby town in England named “Braithwaite” just  adds to the possible confusion. This mistake was made in 2012 in GM data.  Google, to its credit, corrected the error within weeks.  The consequences for a business of having every part of the location  correct but having an incorrect street number could be devastating. This  error will send potential consumers, relying on smartphones or mobile  maps, to another block, perhaps on the other side of town. This incorrect  block is probably also on the same shopping street and may harbor rival  businesses.  Therefore,  someone  searching  for  a  restaurant  might  easily  find a different restaurant and settle for that one instead. Also, misclas- sification of features in POI data may lead one to the wrong location being  visited by consumers  e.g., Voodoo Tattoo in Huntsville, Texas, being clas- sified by Tom Tom as a restaurant .  An  interesting  miscategorization  that  has  implications  for  m-com- merce and businesses involves data for the town of Lindora, California  where  a  storefront  weight  loss  program  was  identified  as  the  “Lindora  Medical Clinic.” This feature in AM covers an entire city block with the  pink Hospital color and a Red Cross logo in the center. In fact, this non- existent hospital occupies all the space in a strip center, which in fact has  a McDonald’s and a Chevron Gas station, none of which are portrayed.  Conversely, the Bethesda Naval Hospital and National Institutes of Health         Chapter twenty-one:  Strategic and tactical issues  459  Complex in Maryland is not portrayed on AM at all. Since this complex  has 4 hospitals, 27 research institutes, and 75 buildings on a 300-acre cam- pus, it is a significant omission. The errors involving hospitals could have  tragic consequences. One can imagine an iPhone user desperately search- ing for the nearest hospital and driving to the weight loss program office  with a critically injured passenger. The potential liability of AM in this  instance is unsettled, but disclaimers that the maps are for reference only  might absolve the developers from legal liability  Sovocool, 2008 .  Another type of error involves Powell Butte Nature Park in Portland,  Oregon, which is portrayed as probably 50 times its true size and occupies  most  of  the  Eastern  part  of  that  important  city.  The  Main  Train  station  in  Helsinki,  Finland  is  also  mapped  as  a  park  as  was  Madison  Square  Garden in New York City. A heuristic for data builders seems to be, “when  in doubt, make it a park.”  There  are  numerous  search  problems  that  are  due  to  ambiguity  in  naming. For example, there are at least 11 places named “Riverside” in  the  United  States.  One  of  the  great  areas  of  superiority  of  GM’s  intelli- gent  search  algorithms  over  rivals  like  AM  and  BM  are  that  Google  is  unsurpassed in giving users options. Thus, a user in Texas who searches  for “Riverside” will be given the “City of Riverside”  population 525  as  well  as  options  for  “Riverside,  California”   population  over  1,000,000   and  the  neighborhood  of  San  Antonio  called  “Riverside”   population  approximately  5,000 ,  but  not  Riverside,  New  Jersey   population  about  8,700 . Similarly, a search initiated in New York will omit the two places  called “Riverside” in Texas but add the one in New Jersey to the much  larger one in CA as well as offer “Riverside Drive” in New York City as  an alternative choice. On an iPhone used in Riverside, Texas, a search for  “Riverside” will yield only Riverside, California. To find a map showing  where the City of Riverside in Texas is, one needs to specify “Riverside,  Walker County, Texas.” This type of issue affected users in England who  searched for “London” and were given maps of London, Ontario as the  default option. An Apple user interviewed on a London Street by CNN in  a report in October 2012 about issues with AM, indicated he was unper- turbed because he “liked Canada and Canadians.”  Another iconic AM error was associated with labels for oceans that  were misplaced by tens of thousands of miles and appeared both at sea  and in the middle of land masses. Thus, the “Arctic Ocean” appears in  blue  script  off  the  south  coast  of  Tamil  Nadu,  India.  The  Indian  Ocean  appears in Northern Greenland, the North Pacific Ocean is in the middle  of Africa. Other labels that were vast distances away from their true loca- tion include “Berlin” appearing at the South Pole, and the label “Cayman  Islands” appearing on the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea. Issues with labels  being  in  the  wrong  language  and  alphabet  were  associated  with  AM  labels in Chinese characters appearing in Krakow, Poland.        460  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Airports that were misplaced were a major potential source of incon- venience  to  travelers.  A  hurried  traveler,  who  searched  for  “Heathrow  Airport” while in London, would find that the drop pin was located on  Bath Street near Vicarage Road in the residential Hounslow West neigh- borhood of London, miles away from the correct location. Conversely, a  search for “London Heathrow Airport” placed a drop pin on the termi- nal building. Airport errors plagued the entire AM product because the  underlying Tom Tom data did not include a good set of airports in their  POI  data  set.  A  travel  writer  in  Australia  missed  his  flight  because  the  drop pin for the international airport in Melbourne  the second largest in  the country  was located on a dead-end street on the far side of the run- ways and inaccessible to the terminal. One would need to know the cor- rect street address for the terminal or spot the terminal on imagery and  manually enter a destination point, for AM to give correct turn-by-turn  directions to this busy airport. Other airports with issues included San  Francisco, Akron, Fairbanks, and Kathmandu.  The turn-by-turn navigation features in AM often led users to the end  of dead-end streets portrayed as through roads on the maps and routes.  Other  routing  errors  included  routing  cars  across  open  water  where  there  were  no  bridges  or  diversions  of  the  route  that  should  have  been  along  a  coastal  road  to  inaccessible  off-shore  islands.  Specific  examples  of  this  error  include  the  routes  along  the  coasts  in  England,  Denmark,  and Spain. In one case in Denmark, a bridge was avoided in turn-by-turn  directions and drivers were routed to a ferry service that cost more and  took much longer. Surprisingly, this error also occurs with respect to the  route between San Francisco and Marin County, California. One would  suppose that every Apple employee in Cupertino could choose the route  using the Golden Gate Bridge  which was not melted, incidentally  but the  routing function chooses to have users take a ferry service, which is nice  for a leisurely excursion by a sightseeing pedestrian, but impractical or  impossible for a daily commuter.  In a number of other cases, the directions were more than mislead- ing,  they  were  dangerous.  For  example,  the  interchange  between  two  interstate highways in Ohio was shown so that drivers would have been  directed to drive off an overpass rather than take the correct flyover ramp.  In  other  cases  AM  users  have  been  left  stranded  on  dead-end  roads  in  isolated places, such as the outback of Australia.  21.4  Wide world of woes It is probable that there are errors in AM data for every country on earth  even  the  smallest  ones,  since  errors  in  the  correct  boundaries  of  the  Vatican  City,  Monaco,  San  Marino,  Andorra,  and  Lichtenstein  have  all  been identified in AM as well as GM data. However, to get a feeling for         Chapter twenty-one:  Strategic and tactical issues  461  the vast scope of errors and the diversity of different issues that exist with  AM data, a list of selected nations with telling or unusual errors follows.  It should help readers comprehend the global magnitude of the spatial  woes facing Apple.  In  Albania,  many  parts  of  the  country  are  only  in  black  and  white  imagery due to a failure to separate the bands on available imagery. Also,  the same area is displayed at differing resolutions and in different sea- sons. The discrepancies in tone from one image to another are dramatic  and disconcerting.  In Argentina, the Bonin Islands are portrayed as spikes rising almost  vertically from the water. The port complex at Puerto Madero not only  gets labeled with one drop pin, but six separate alternative drop pins for it  are scattered at somewhat random locations within the city.  In Australia, Mildura, Victoria  population 35,000  is located 384 km  from  its  true  location.  Most  cities  in  Victoria  can  be  found  only  when  their name is supplemented by the state name in searches. The Sidney  Opera House  one of the world’s most iconic buildings  is missing and the  area is only identified as “Bennelong Point.” Cairns, Australia are por- trayed over 100 km from its correct location, with no roads reaching it. In  many cases, town names in Australia were replaced with those of busi- nesses  located  in  the  same  city.  Thus,  “Tatura,”  Victoria,  was  replaced  with “Commercial Hotel  Tatura .” The Yeronga Hospital  a major medi- cal center in Brisbane  was identified as a hotel. Another error in Brisbane  was  identification  of  a  church  as  a  retail  business,  despite  bearing  the  name “Christian Brethren Church.” Some of the errors in Australia prob- ably  related  to  aboriginal  place  names  being  unfamiliar  and  difficult  to differentiate or enter for the staff creating the maps. Thus “Mildura”   a city  is conflated with “Mandurah”  a large bay missing from the map   and  with  “Murray  Regional  Nature  Park.”  All  these  places  have  M,  U,  and A, and a typo in one can cause a chain reaction of misidentifications.  Several  travelers  to  Mildura  were  left  stranded  far  from  any  services  overnight in the Murray Nature Park, this led the Victoria State Police to  call a news conference warning motorists not to rely on AM for naviga- tion  ABC News, 2012 .  There is virtually no data for Belarus in AM. The paucity of data in  AM for some countries, in contrast with the detailed data in BM and GM,  indicates the long distance that Apple has to go to have a truly global set  of geospatial data. For example, in the capital of Minsk there is only one  road portrayed in AM  an outer loop highway . This is one of three con- centric loop highways and one of eight highways and hundreds of arterial  streets that are portrayed in Minsk alone in GM.  Several  Latin  American  countries  have  problems.  In  Brazil,  several  buildings and trees in Rio De Janeiro were melting in the 3D view. A foot- ball stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil was labeled only in Japanese characters.        462  Mobile Electronic Commerce  In Chile, portions of Punta Arenas’ street network are portrayed as sit- ting in the Pacific Ocean. Over 50 streets are shown in the sea with the streets  being up to 1000 m off the mapped shoreline. Mexico had a similar issue with  streets in Cancun apparently at sea, but in that case in a different ocean.  China has issues with labels that only appear in poorly transliterated  English.  BM  has  far  more  streets  labeled  in  both  Beijing  and  Shanghai  in Chinese characters or in pinyin transliterations  perhaps as a result of  the  alliance  of  Navteq  with  the  Chinese  government .  China  Nav  Info,  which is 50% owned by Navteq  which was acquired by Nokia and now  part  of  Microsoft ,  has  been  designated  by  the  Chinese  Government  as  the sole developer of vehicle navigation systems data in China. Therefore,  Microsoft has a growing advantage over both its rivals in China  Leipnik  et  al.,  2012 .  Missing  major  rivers  are  a  common  theme  in  China.  For  example, the Yangtze River  China’s largest river  is missing completely  from Chung King, a city of 20 million people and the fourth largest in  the country. While in the most populous city, the Pearl River is missing  from Shanghai’s Pudong district. This district alone has over three million  inhabitants.  Completely  omitting  these  rivers,  which  divide  and  define  these cities, is an inexcusable cartographic lapse.  Additional countries have specific issues. For example, large areas of  Croatia’s coast are only portrayed in black and white imagery. In the Czech  Republic, official Slavicized names of many places are uniformly replaced  by earlier German names not used since 1945  Similarly, a square in Berlin  was labeled “Adolf Hitler Platz” . The Falkland Islands are filled with spikes,  possibly due to issues of this area being disputed territory between the  United Kingdom and Argentina. The same error occurs in Tahiti, which  is an undisputed possession of France. In Finland, Helsinki’s main train  station and the surrounding area are identified not as a station but as a  park with a uniform green fill as well as a tree marker symbol. In France,  the images of the Eiffel Tower lying apparently on its side in the 3D view  is startling but it is not as distorted as the famous Millau Viaduct Bridge  that  consists  of  eight  separate  triangles.  Also,  the  village  of  Cadeillan    population of 74 people  appears in the middle of an undeveloped open  space  several  kilometers  from  its  true  location  with  no  roads  leading  to it. In Germany, the Winninger Bridge is melting. The main cathedral in  Cologne is colored and labeled as a train station. The main Lutheran cathe- dral in Copenhagen, Denmark is labeled as a Burger King restaurant. In  Ireland, the “Airfield” urban farm in Dublin was portrayed with an airport  symbol. The potential that misguided pilots could attempt to land at the  large farm with the airplane symbol in it led the Irish Attorney General to  make a public announcement on Irish Television that he had formally con- tacted Apple about the error that he deemed a danger to public safety. The  Dublin Zoo was also missing. In Italy, the central square in Milan looks as  if a nuclear blast has taken place  with scores of deformed buildings .        Chapter twenty-one:  Strategic and tactical issues  463  In India, the Ganges River is missing in Varanasi. This is the holiest  of rivers to the Hindus in the holiest of cities. It is a very large feature not  portrayed on AM, although the bridges across it are shown and labeled  as bridges. In Kolkata, the Hooghly River is portrayed, but its location has  been shifted over about 1000 m to the East, so that it is under a dense street  network and the bridges across it though portrayed have no river under  them.  It  is  possible  that  imagery  from  a  period  of  monsoonal  flooding  contributed to this type of error.  In Japan, the world’s busiest train station at Shinjuku is not shown in  its correct location but in a nature park of the same name and multiple  train and subway stations are shown in the center of water features, such  as bays and rivers. These features are mislabeled with Tokyo Bay labeled  as the North Pacific Ocean. POI for many features were missing, in par- ticular numerous small eating establishments were omitted. In fact, AM  was unable to locate the Apple Store in Ginza district of Tokyo. It is note- worthy that Japan presents a cartographic challenge, because few streets  have  names  and  houses  are  numbered  by  block  in  chronological  order  of date of construction, not spatially. These challenges were overcome by  domestic spatial data developers Increment P Corporation, and Mapion  over  the  past  decade.  Apple  initially  opted  to  not  purchase  their  data.  There were such problems with AM of Japan that apple released a sepa- rate update before waiting for its planned 6.1.3 revision with much better  data based on purchase of domestically developed Japanese data  Nine- to-FiveMac, 2013 . The problems with AM in Japan were blamed for poor  sales of iPhones there in 2012 in a New York Times article that highlighted  the  success  of  rival  domestic  Japanese  web  map  maker  Mapion,  which  began experiencing a huge increase in page views on its website reaching  86 million per month in late 2012  Tabuchi, 2012 .  In  New  Zealand,  the  drop  pin  and  label  for  the  main  train  station  at  Auckland was portrayed in the waters of the harbor. In Norway, an edge of  frame issue with glare from the lens of the aerial imaging platform caused  an explosion of bright white grading into bands of purple and green over  the  town  hall  of  Lenvik.  In  Russia,  clouds  are  covering  portions  of  Red  Square in Moscow. In fact, most of Russia has only major connecting roads   i.e., between Moscow and Saint Petersburg  portrayed. In Serbia, the Danube  River  is  missing  from  its  capital,  Belgrade.  As  this  is  largest  river  in  the  region and forms the part of the nation’s border, so it is a significant lapse.  Large  areas  of  Capetown,  South  Africa  appear  under  cloud  cover.  Capetown is in the most technologically advanced African nation and one  with reasonably good geospatial data and a number of mapping websites.  In one of Tom Tom’s more audacious claims, the company went from claim- ing that it had geospatial data in only a handful of African countries in  2011 to claiming the majority of Africa as mapped  at least to some extent   in 2013. The real quality and quantity of this data is highly questionable.        464  Mobile Electronic Commerce  Goteborg,  Sweden’s  second  largest  city   with  a  population  of  over  504,000  is not labeled at any scale in AM. This error is probably due to the  city having multiple spellings and the staff working on the maps putting  off labeling the area until the name was resolved. The drop pin for the air- port in Jonkoping appears over a farm and the runway has multiple hills  due to errors in the draping algorithm.  In  the  Ukraine,  the  base  of  Russia’s  Black  Sea  Fleet  in  Savastopol  is  missing entirely from AM, apparently due to it being a high security area.  Kiev  spelled Kyiv in Ukrainian  is labeled “Klyv” in AM. One can see how  the use of the Ukrainian spelling plus misinterpreting an “I” as an “L” can  cause this sort of error but one feels that to misspell the name of a city of six  million and the most sacred in the Russian orthodoxy religion is a major  error, especially since it is such a short name. Only about 10% of the roads  in Ukraine are portrayed in AM and many towns are missing as well.  In the United Kingdom, a series of convoluted interrelated errors involve  the historic city of Stratford-upon-Avon  which is a tourist mecca and the  birthplace  of  Shakespeare .  These  errors  involve  simultaneously  leaving  the city of Stafford-upon-Avon off the map and list of towns and replac- ing the polygon defining the urban area with a pink fill and a Red Cross  symbol  and  labeling  the  whole  place  “Stratford-upon-Avon  Hospital.”  A search for Stratford-upon-Avon does not find the town but instead zooms  to  Birmingham  and  locates  Stratford-upon-Avon  TV  LTD   a  television  repair service . The United Kingdom has a lot of complicated hyphenated  place names that make mapping a challenge. An iconic error involved the  Manchester  United  Football  Club  not  being  linked  to  any  place,  despite  having a huge stadium and being the most important sports franchise in  Europe. Instead, the Sale United Football Club in Manchester is mapped  in response to a search for “Manchester United Football Club.” Sale United  is an amateur boys club with a few teenage and preteen squads. This error  was wildly reposted on websites since it confused clubs at opposite ends  of  the  spectrum  of  possible  significance.  Other  mistakes  include  moving  Blackpool  to  the  Cornish  coast  and  spelling  Doncaster  as  “Duncaster,”  Westminster  as  “Westminister,”  and  Torquay  as  “Torbay.”  Paddington  Station in London was identified as a park, while Aldewych subway sta- tion, which has been closed for many years, was portrayed as open. The  errors involving London’s public transportation network led to the posting  of signs in underground stations offering official paper maps for the benefit  of lost iPhone users.  A large portion of the city of Valencia, Venezuela is missing and many  of the areas on the west side of this city have incorrect names. As is com- mon, the space where features should be filled with streets is filled with  green to indicate it is parkland or open space. Possible reasons for this  lack of information include lack of cooperation from local authorities in         Chapter twenty-one:  Strategic and tactical issues  465  a chaotic country, heavy tree canopy, and possibly confusion about the  correct name for a region that exists with similar names in several places   such as Spain and California .  While many of the errors stated earlier are specific to a particular coun- try, some errors in AM are truly international in scope. Thus, one does not  know which country to associate with a search for “Rome” that yields a  map of North Korea or a search for “London” that yields a map of Ontario,  Canada.  AM  also  identifies  Taiwan  as  a  province  of  China,  for  political  reasons. Some errors involve multiple countries, such as a portion of the  French border portrayed crossing Lake Geneva and entering what is Swiss  territory and  swallowing up the town  of  Céligny  in  Switzerland  before  re-crossing the lake to reenter actual French territory. Another territorial  error involves the border of Lithuania and Belarus with a small enclave of  Lithuania as a seeming island inside the nation of Belarus. The disputed  island of Senkaku  also called Diaoyu  appears twice with a small separa- tion on the map of the East China Sea. If this uninhabited place were in  fact two identical islands in reality, the ongoing dispute between China  and Japan over the sovereignty of island could be easily resolved.  In defense of Apple and Tom Tom, AM has extremely few errors in the  Netherlands and more generally in the Benelux countries. Tom Tom is head- quartered in Amsterdam, Holland and it and predecessor Teleatlas have  for over two decades produced high-quality data for Holland, Belgium,  and Luxembourg. In fact, GM showed a car parked on the side of a wall in  Westenbergstraat, Holland while Apple did not have this or any reported  errors in Holland. However, Apple does have imagery depicting cars driv- ing two stories up the side of a building in Madrid, Spain. Tom Tom POI  data are quite good for Shell stations worldwide as both firms are Dutch  based. California-based Chevron also has high-quality AM data. But AM  data is poor for Texas-based Valero and Exxon-Mobile. One might suppose  that the death of distance would make it equally easy for geospatial data to  be dispatched from Texas to Cupertino or Amsterdam as for data from  Holland or California would be, but the human contacts that make sharing  data more feasible may be present among a group of Dutch or California  based GIS analysts based in Holland or California and not among those  based in other nations or metropolitan areas  Cainrcross, 2006 . While it  might be construed as a case of damming with faint praise, Apple also has far  superior maps compared with Bing or Google for North Korea.  21.5  Response of consumers and competitors Although the troubles of AM elicited reactions ranging from anger and pity  to elation and self-satisfied smirks among consumers in the many videos  posted online, most responses of competitors were muted. Nevertheless,         466  Mobile Electronic Commerce  there were responses such as the advertising campaign launched in print  and billboard media and frequently reposted on the Internet of Samsung  in Australia. The Victoria State Police issued a formal warning to motor- ists,  in  a  televised  news  conference,  that  due  to  the  Mildura  and  other  errors, the use of iPhone could lead to more travelers being stranded many  kilometers from any services in the outback. This gave official imprimatur  to  the  poor  quality  of  AM  relative  to  rival  Google’s  offerings  available  on Samsung smartphones. A Samsung Galaxy SII phone was featured in  advertisements with a Victoria map on it and the caption “Oops…should  have got a Samsung…Get navigation you can trust.” Microsoft also later  chimed in citing the reality distortion field surrounding overhyped Apple  product releases and touting its surface tablet and BM tools and imagery   Keizer, 2013 .  The  criticism  of  AM  became  viral  in  the  form  of  numerous  parody  videos  on  YouTube.  It  is  ironic  that  in  addition  to  losing  access  to  GM,  users of iOS 6 also lost easy access to YouTube where they could view doz- ens of videos lampooning AM. The most frequent parodies were Hitler  first looking at a paper map of Berlin in his bunker, than going into an  obscenity-laced rant about AM and their errors, the lack of the ability to  get GM, and the lack of mechanisms to report problems. Other popular  parodies included the Batman Dark Knight being repeatedly lost using an  iPhone and Jack Nicholson’s character from The Shining using an iPhone to  try to chase Danny through a frozen outdoor maze and hearing the perky  then  increasingly  the  testy  voice  of  Seri  leading  him  to  a  frozen  death.  Parodies  of  Apple  commercials  featured  lost  iPhone  users  standing  in  front of a pizzeria and unable to find a pizza place in Yelp. There was also  a clever British parody where a supposed Apple executive named Nigel  Seep explains, with a clipped British accent, that if the iPhone 5 is held in a  certain angle the phone’s quantum processor will access a parallel universe  that features melting bridges, the London Eye Ferris Wheel without con- necting spokes, and Basingstoke plopped unceremoniously in the middle  of  farm  fields.  This  parody  also  highlights  the  antenna  issues  with  the  iPhone 4S  New York Times, 2010 . The initial denial of that issue by Apple  presaged the more damaging initial denial that AM were seriously flawed.  These parodies were popular enough to attract a cumulative 2 million plus  views within less than a year of their creation. Of course, like many aspects  of the web, their popularity rapidly wore off. But with consumers making  decisions about which mobile device to buy on average every 2 years in  the United States, these videos were a potentially powerful influence on  buying decisions of many consumers  Phone Arena, 2011 . In particular,  they probably influenced that group of Apple users who opted to down- load GM as their default mapping choice when it became easy in late 2012.  These more tech savvy users are a key demographic that Apple has proba- bly lost for good, in terms of mobile mapping and location-based services.        Chapter twenty-one:  Strategic and tactical issues  467  21.6  Corporate response The explanation for the many issues with AM is not just a failure to per- form adequate quality control and beta testing before product release. Nor  is it an overly ambitious release target date, or even a failure of leadership  on the part of the three senior executives in charge of AM, all of whom  were fired within 3 months of the first release of AM. These executives  were Scott Forstall, who personally unveiled AM in September 2012 and  was  manager  for  all  mobile  applications  at  Apple.  He  was  fired  in  late  October  2012.  Mr.  Forstall  had  reportedly  refused  to  apologize,  some- thing that Apple CEO Timothy Cook did soon after. At the same time John  Browett, head of Retail at Apple, was terminated. His connection to AM  was less direct than that of Mr. Forstall. The lack of a means for consumers  to report problems or rectify errors with AM, which was one of his respon- sibilities,  probably  led  to  his  termination   Wingfield  and  Bilton,  2012 .  These two terminations were followed a month later by that of Richard  Williamson,  the  manager  directly  responsible  for  AM  implementation   Chen  and  Wingfield,  2012 .  These  changes  probably  are  cosmetic  since  the issue with AM is a deeper strategic flaw at Apple where it appears  the company supposes that acquiring another firm or the rights to use its  data can solve longstanding issues without the need for developing inter- nal expertise. Microsoft had its own GIS software at one time  MapPoint   and almost two decades of experience with imagery on TerraServer and  its own BM  and it now owns Navteq . Apple has never had much expe- rience with geospatial technologies and deferred to rival Google, which  with GM, Google Earth, Bird’s Eye View, and Streetview, is the worldwide  leader in online maps and imagery and has been a geospatial technology  leader for over a decade. Apple could not replicate this expertise simply  by acquiring Yelp, and Locationary, and proposing to buy Tom Tom and  licensing all their maps and other data.  The errors in AM have had a tremendous impact on the valuation  and  stock  price  of  Apple.  While  the  decline  in  the  stock  price  cannot  be solely attributed to the AM debacle, there is no doubt that it played  an important role in influencing stock analysts and it reduced consumer  confidence regarding Apple products. If Apple can fix its problems with  AM,  consumers  will  forget  it  in  a  few  years.  By  2013  it  was  clear  that  the majority of Apple iPhone users had adopted the new OS and phones  and  about  two  thirds  were  using  AM  rather  than  taking  the  time  to  go the Apple I Tunes store and download GM. Figure 21.1 portrays the  decline in Apple stock price from an all-time high of over $700 a share  to a low  after the apologies, terminations of executives, and reversion to  access GM in early January  of less than $400 per share. The beginning  of the steep decline coincides with the release of the iOS 6 and AM on  September 19, 2012.        468  Mobile Electronic Commerce  s w o  l l a   e l p p A  s p a m   e l g o o G     3 1   c e D n o   e g a s u     d a e h   s p a m   e l p p A  n o s m a i l l i     W d r a h c i R     7 2   v o N n o d e r i f        e c i r p k c o t s   e l p p A     e r a w  t f o s   S O  n h o J   d a e h    l i a t e r   e l p p A  i    d n a   t t e w o r B        9 2   t c O n o d e r fi d a e h     '     i      s k o o C m T O E C   e l p p A     l  n o   y g o o p a   l a m r o f  8 2   t p e S    e s a e l e r   s p a m   e l p p A     9 1   t p e S n o     30-Jan-13 28-Jan-13 26-Jan-13 24-Jan-13 22-Jan-13 20-Jan-13 18-Jan-13 16-Jan-13 14-Jan-13 12-Jan-13 10-Jan-13 8-Jan-13 6-Jan-13 4-Jan-13 2-Jan-13 31-Dec-12 29-Dec-12 27-Dec-12 25-Dec-12 23-Dec-12 21-Dec-12 19-Dec-12 17-Dec-12 15-Dec-12 13-Dec-12 11-Dec-12 9-Dec-12 7-Dec-12 5-Dec-12 3-Dec-12 1-Dec-12 29-Nov-12 27-Nov-12 25-Nov-12 23-Nov-12 21-Nov-12 19-Nov-12 17-Nov-12 15-Nov-12 13-Nov-12 11-Nov-12 9-Nov-12 7-Nov-12 5-Nov-12 3-Nov-12 1-Nov-12 30-Oct-12 28-Oct-12 26-Oct-12 24-Oct-12 22-Oct-12 20-Oct-12 18-Oct-12 16-Oct-12 14-Oct-12 12-Oct-12 10-Oct-12 8-Oct-12 6-Oct-12 4-Oct-12 2-Oct-12 30-Sep-12 28-Sep-12 26-Sep-12 24-Sep-12 22-Sep-12 20-Sep-12 18-Sep-12 16-Sep-12 14-Sep-12 12-Sep-12 10-Sep-12 8-Sep-12 6-Sep-12 4-Sep-12     e c i r p k c o t s   e l p p A  0 5 7  5 2 7  0 0 7  5 7 6  0 5 6  5 2 6  0 0 6  5 7 5  0 5 5  5 2 5  0 0 5  5 7 4  0 5 4  5 2 4  0 0 4    a          Chapter twenty-one:  Strategic and tactical issues  469  t s e w o L     e c i r p k c o t s   e l p p A  24-Sep-13 17-Sep-13 10-Sep-13 3-Sep-13 27-Aug-13 20-Aug-13 13-Aug-13 6-Aug-13 30-Jul-13 23-Jul-13 16-Jul-13 9-Jul-13 2-Jul-13 25-Jun-13 18-Jun-13 11-Jun-13 4-Jun-13 28-May-13 21-May-13 14-May-13 7-May-13 30-Apr-13 23-Apr-13 16-Apr-13 9-Apr-13 2-Apr-13 26-Mar-13 19-Mar-13 12-Mar-13 5-Mar-13 26-Feb-13 19-Feb-13 12-Feb-13 5-Feb-13 29-Jan-13 22-Jan-13 15-Jan-13 8-Jan-13 1-Jan-13 25-Dec-12 18-Dec-12 11-Dec-12 4-Dec-12 27-Nov-12 20-Nov-12 13-Nov-12 6-Nov-12 30-Oct-12 23-Oct-12 16-Oct-12 9-Oct-12 2-Oct-12 25-Sep-12 18-Sep-12 11-Sep-12 4-Sep-12    .  k c o t s   e l p p A    f o    e r a h s   r e p    e c i r P    : s i x a - y      b     .  3 1 0 2     d n a     2 1 0 2    , s e t a d     d e t a l e r -  M A    t n a t r o p m  I   : s i x a - x      a     . e c i r p     k c o t s   e l p p A       1  .  1 2    e r u g i F    . 4 1 0 2    ,           0 1 h c r a M d e s s e c c A  . m o c . o o h a y . e c n a n fi     p t t h m o r F       :     e c i r p k c o t s   y l r a e y   e l p p A  t s e h g i H  0 5 7  0 0 7  0 5 6  0 0 6  0 5 5  0 0 5  0 5 4  0 0 4  0 5 3    b          470  Mobile Electronic Commerce  21.7  Conclusion The mistakes that Apple made, with respect to AM, was not in attempting  to take on GM and BM directly. If Apple had not launched AM, it would  have continued to lose advertising revenue, POI, and search results. Being  third, not to mention starting to fall behind new mapping aps in India and  China was not a good strategy. Where Apple made the worst blunder in its  corporate history was in trying to do in only a few years what had taken  rivals  over  a  decade.  AM  was  also  underinvested  and  oversold.  It  was  not an adequate strategy to acquire Tom Tom data rights and buy Yelp,  C3  Technologies,  etc.  Apple  needed  to  invest  tens  of  billions  of  dollars  and millions of person hours in gathering geospatial data. It needed to  buy more rights to high-resolution imagery from SPOT or Digital Globe.  It  needed  to  purchase  the  best  available  data  whether  commercial  data  like Mapion or Increment P Corporation data in Japan or public  though  far from free  data like the Ordnance Survey data in the United Kingdom  or government data in Singapore and Taiwan. Apple also needed to better  understand that geospatial data is error prone and rather than roll out AM  with unjustified hubris, it should have anticipated a flood of error reports  and created a mechanism for users to report errors and be rewarded for  doing  so   like  Google  has .  This  is  particularly  true  for  businesses  that  were misplaced or miscategorized. Instead, Apple shifted blame to ven- dors like Tom Tom and Yelp who in return shifted blame back to Apple.  Proper beta testing should also have revealed the vast number of iconic  errors that permeate AM, many of which could have been easily corrected.
