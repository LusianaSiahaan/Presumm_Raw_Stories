This could be because they don’t like the syntax of JavaScript and so try to avoid writing pure JavaScript as much as possible, or it could just be because they’re hoping that they’ll never have to work on a project where they can’t use jQuery. Whatever the reason, this can result in the parts of their code that aren’t using jQuery being inefficient or incorrect. If any of this sounds like you, then this book provides an opportunity for you to expand your knowledge of the bits of JavaScript that jQuery covers up for you. In the first four chapters, we’ll cover event handling, prototypes, working with the DOM, and AJAX. Chapter 5 is about conventions in JavaScript, and covers some common conventions and patterns in JavaScript. There are also two appendixes: Appendix A aims to teach JavaScript to someone who has never written it without jQuery before, and Appen- dix B highlights some useful tools that you can use to aid you when coding. You can find all the major functions from this book, such as the AJAX and event functions, and some additional code samples, on this GitHub repo. Who This Book Is For This book is targeted at developers who know jQuery, but who don’t yet feel confident in their JavaScript knowledge or would just like to know more. You don’t need to know everything there is to know about jQuery, as I’ll be explaining what something does if it isn’t already obvious—for example, I wouldn’t explain what .fadeIn   does, as it is descriptive enough that it doesn’t require explanation.  www.it-ebooks.info  vii   Who This Book Isn’t For This book assumes a basic knowledge of jQuery, and I wouldn’t recommend reading it if you have no experience in JavaScript or jQuery. If that describes you, I would recommend finding a basic JavaScript book such as Michael Morrison’s Head First JavaScript, David Sawyer McFarland’s JavaScript and jQuery: The Missing Manual, or Shelley Powers’s Learning JavaScript. For a more comprehensive exploration, try David Flanagan’s JavaScript: The Definitive Guide. While it certainly won’t hurt, this book wasn’t written for you if you already consider yourself fairly good with JavaScript, and you may not learn much. You won’t have covered everything in the book  especially in Chapter 5 , but a lot of it will likely be material you already know.

Without jQuery, I would be stuck spending half my time debugging Internet Explorer issues!  x     Preface  www.it-ebooks.info   CHAPTER 1 Event Handling  In JavaScript, an event is the result of an action that can be detected by JavaScript— for example, the user clicking a button or the page load completing. Events are the heart of pretty much all web applications. Event handling, as you can probably tell by the name, is how we handle these events. jQuery provides a suite of functions to make event handling considerably easier than in JavaScript alone. While this is nice, it can add overhead and remove control from you, the developer. For this reason, it is important to know how you can handle events without jQuery in pure JavaScript. In this chapter, I’ll be covering that as well as a few other topics that can help your jQuery knowledge, such as more about what events actually are and how they work. Internet Explorer 8 and below does event handling completely differently than any other browser, and completely independently from any standards. If you’re writing an application that needs to support 99% of the market share and you cannot use jQuery, then you will need to write for these older browsers—even IE6 still has an over 5% market share at the time of writing. This chapter will cover event handling in Internet Explorer as well as in other browsers. Listening for Events Events in jQuery The best way to explain events is probably by using an example, and the best example  as I’m assuming that you know jQuery  is to show an extract of jQuery code that works with events. The following code turns the anchor element with ID foo red when it is clicked, and then prevents the link from being followed by calling e.preventDe fault  :  www.it-ebooks.info  1   $ 'afoo' .click function  e  {         $ this .css 'color', 'red' ;         e.preventDefault  ; } ;  Events in JavaScript Following is the same code, but in pure JavaScript. It will not work in IE8 and below, which we will cover in the next section:  var foo = document.getElementById 'foo' ; foo.addEventListener 'click', function  e  {         this.style.color = 'red';         e.preventDefault  ; } ;  The .addEventListener function accepts three arguments. The first is the event type, and the second is the callback to be called when the event is fired. The third argument allows you to specify whether the event should be capturing or bubbling  i.e., the order in which it should propagate in; I’ll explain this later , but as IE8 and below don’t support that, it isn’t commonly used. The callback is sent the event as an argument, which contains a lot of information—such as the x and y positions of the mouse when it clicked the element, and information on elements such as the current element and the element from which the event was fired  they can be different if the event has propagated . It also has some useful methods such as .preventDefault   and .stop Propagation  . The callback is called with the element as the context, so the element can be referred to using this. Unlike with jQuery, the return value doesn’t do anything at all. .preventDefault   stops the default action from happening. For example, if we had a link to some website with ID foo   Click here!   and we ran the previous code, clicking the link would not go to that web- site, as the call to  e.preventDefault   would prevent it  following the link is the default action . In jQuery, you can also return false to prevent the default action. However, this also stops the event from propagating  we will cover event propagation later , which is generally undesired. Events in Internet Explorer 8 Internet Explorer 9 introduced support for .addEventListener, and so can use the preceding code. However, earlier IE versions don’t support it, so we have to use another function, .attachEvent. It only supports bubbling events, and you can’t refer to the  2      Chapter 1: Event Handling  www.it-ebooks.info   element using this; you have to use either e.target or e.srcElement  although it is easier to just save the element from earlier . It also doesn’t support  e.preventDe fault  ; we have to set e.returnValue to false instead. Following is the same code from the previous two examples, but for Internet Explorer 8:  var foo = document.getElementById 'foo' ; foo.attachEvent 'onclick', function  e  {             Either:         foo.style.color = 'red';             Or:           e.target  ? e.target : e.srcElement .style.color = 'red';          e.returnValue = false; } ;  Writing a Wrapper Function jQuery makes it very easy to bind events to objects in every browser, but it isn’t always necessary to load the entire jQuery library just to use the event handling functions, which can be replicated fairly easily. I’ll give you some code, and then I will explain how it works:  function addEventListener element, event, handler  {         if  element.addEventListener  {                 element.addEventListener event, handler ;         } else if  element.attachEvent  {                 element.attachEvent 'on' + event, function  e  {                         e.preventDefault = function    {                                 e.returnValue = false;                         };                          handler.call element, e ;                 } ;         } }  We can then call it using the following code  in any browser :  var foo = document.getElementById 'foo' ; addEventListener foo, 'click', function  e  {         this.style.color = 'red';         e.preventDefault  ; } ;  The addEventListener function first checks whether the element has the .addEvent Listener method, and if so, then it calls it normally. If it doesn’t exist, the function  Listening for Events      3  www.it-ebooks.info   checks whether the .attachEvent method exists, and if so, then it calls function as the handler. When the anonymous function is called, it calls the actual handler us- ing  .call, which allows us to specify the scope to be used as the first argument, meaning that we can refer to the element using this. To enable us to use the e.preventDefault   function in Internet Explorer, I’m adding that function to the event, and when it is called, I’m setting e.returnValue to false. We could also do this the other way around using the following, but I won’t be keeping this code as we develop this function throughout the chapter because it isn’t standard- conforming like e.preventDefault  :  function addEventListener element, event, handler  {         if  element.addEventListener  {                 element.addEventListener event, function  e  {                         handler.call this, e ;                          if  e.returnValue === false  {                                 e.preventDefault  ;                         }                 } ;         } else if  element.attachEvent  {                 element.attachEvent 'on' + event, function  e  {                         handler.call element, e ;                 } ;         } }  That can be called as follows in any browser: var foo = document.getElementById 'foo' ; addEventListener foo, 'click', function  e  {         this.style.color = 'red';         e.returnValue = false; } ;  We can also replicate jQuery’s return false behavior by checking the return value of the event handler:  function addEventListener element, event, handler  {         if  element.addEventListener  {                 element.addEventListener event, function  e  {                         if  handler.call this, e  === false  {                                 e.preventDefault  ;                         }                 } ;                 }         } else if  element.attachEvent  {                 element.attachEvent 'on' + event, function  e  {                         if  handler.call element, e  === false  {                                 e.returnValue = false;  4      Chapter 1: Event Handling  www.it-ebooks.info                           }                 } ;         } }  That can be called as follows in any browser: var foo = document.getElementById 'foo' ; addEventListener foo, 'click', function  e  {         this.style.color = 'red';         return false; } ;  A lot of websites and web-based applications have completely dropped support for Internet Explorer versions earlier than 9, so they do not need to use a wrapper function or .attachEvent, and can just use .addEventListener. This reduces development and testing time, and therefore costs less—but it does remove support for a substantial chunk of the browser market. I’m not going to cover this in any more detail than a brief mention here, but before DOM 3 was specified, events were attached to elements inline. You may have seen something like the following code before:   Click to turn red!   That code is pretty ugly, right? Not only is it very tricky to read, it is also very difficult to maintain. Inline JavaScript and CSS is now frowned upon for those reasons, and JavaScript and CSS should always be kept in external files. It isn’t commonly used anymore, so I won’t be mentioning it again. Adding Event Handlers to Multiple Elements Sometimes it may be useful to add event listeners to multiple elements. There are two different ways to do this: either we can cycle through the elements and add the event handler to each one, or we can add the event handler to a common parent of the elements, and wait for it to bubble up—see the section “Event Propagation”  page 7 . The second method is generally preferred because it uses fewer resources, but if there are only a few elements, it can be overkill. The first method is more commonly used. jQuery does both methods automatically. We can do the first method like this:  $ '.bar' .click callback ;  And the second like this:  $ document .on 'click', '.bar', callback ;  Listening for Events      5  www.it-ebooks.info   JavaScript  does  not  do  this  automatically.  Attempting  to  call  .addEventListener or .attachEvent on a list of elements will throw an error because it isn’t defined, and calling the previously defined addEventListener function just won’t do anything, as it won’t be able to find either method. In order to attach an event to multiple elements, we have to loop through them:  var bars = document.getElementsByClassName 'bar' ; for  var i = 0; i < bars.length; i++  {         addEventListener bars[i], 'click', callback ; }  document.getElementsByClassName returns a NodeList, not an array. One main dif- ference between the two is that NodeLists update live, meaning that changes to the DOM also change the NodeList:  var paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName 'p' ; console.log paragraphs.length ;    3     Create a new paragraph element and append it to the body  console.log paragraphs.length ;    4  Occasionally, this can result in an infinite loop in the page: say you have a function that loops through all paragraph elements, and then copies them to the end of a page. This will also copy them to the end of the NodeList, meaning that they will also be copied to the end of the page again, and again, and again… There are two ways to avoid this. The first is to cache the length of the NodeList:  var paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName 'p' ; for  var i = 0, len = paragraphs.length; i < len; i++  {         document.body.appendChild paragraphs[i].clone true  ; }  This means that if the original length of the NodeList were three, then it would only clone three elements before stopping. The second approach would be to turn the NodeList into an array:  var paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName 'p' ; paragraphs = Array.prototype.slice.call paragraphs ; for  var i = 0; i < paragraphs.length; i++  {         document.body.appendChild paragraphs[i].clone true  ; }  We did this by calling the Array.slice method directly on the NodeList, causing it to treat it like an array. We can call other array methods on the NodeList using the same method; in the following example, we loop through all elements with a data- number attribute and return an array containing all of them:  var elements = document.querySelectorAll '[data-number]' ; var numbers = Array.prototype.map.call elements, function  element  {  6      Chapter 1: Event Handling  www.it-ebooks.info           return Number element.dataset.number ;    Get the data-number attribute } ;  console.log numbers ;    [3, 6, 2, 5.6]  Of course, it is easier to just use jQuery:  var numbers = $ '[data-number]' .map function    {         return $ this .data 'number' ; } ;  console.log numbers ;    [3, 6, 2, 5.6]  jQuery’s $.fn.data function automatically converts number strings to actual num- bers. If you don’t want this behavior, you should use $.fn.attr. Event Propagation When an event is fired on an element, it isn’t just fired for the specific element, it is also fired for all parent elements of that element. This can be pretty useful for setting an event listener on multiple elements at the same time without having to loop through them one by one:  document.addEventListener 'click', function  e  {         var element = e.srcElement;         if  element.tagName === 'A'  {                 var url = getAnchorURL element ;                 if  isEvil url   {                         e.preventDefault  ;                             Inform user that they clicked an "evil" link                 }         } } ;  That code would add a listener for all clicks on anything in the document. When an element with tagName “A”  an anchor element  is clicked, it checks whether the URL is “evil”  e.g., linking to a dangerous site , and if so, it calls  e.preventDefault  , preventing the user from following the link. We have to use e.srcElement instead of this, as this would refer to the document because that is what the event is being fired on. jQuery’s .on method has this behavior built in. There is an optional second parameter that  allows  you  to  specify  a  selector.  If  the  selector  matches  the  source  element  e.srcElement , then the event listener is fired. In effect, the following code does the same thing as the previous:  $ document .on 'click', 'a', function    {         var element = e.srcElement,                 url = getAnchorURL element ;  Event Propagation      7  www.it-ebooks.info           if  isEvil url   {                 e.preventDefault  ;                     Inform user that they clicked an "evil" link         } } ;  The action of events being fired on the parent elements is called event propagation. The order in which they are fired is called the event order. There are two possible event orders that they can be fired in: bubbling and capturing. When an event bubbles, it is fired first on the element itself, and then all of its parents respectively; see Figure 1-1 for a graphical visualization. I find this event order to generally be the most useful.  Figure 1-1. A bubbling event  When an event “captures,” it is fired first on the document body, and then works its way down the tree to the element itself—see Figure 1-2. Both methods can be useful. addEventListener has a third parameter that allows you to specify the order in which you want the event to propagate: true or unspecified for bubbling, or false for capturing. attachEvent doesn’t support capturing event lis- teners at all, and so Internet Explorer 8 and below only supports bubbling events. Going back to our original code sample to stop evil links from being clicked, we can see that it should probably be a capturing event listener rather than a bubbling event listener, as capturing event listeners are called first  see Figure 1-3 . This means that if we call e.stopPropagation  , any event listeners added to the element itself won’t be called, so the link has a lower chance of being followed. Our new code, using capturing event propagation, is as follows:  8      Chapter 1: Event Handling  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 1-2. A capturing event  document.addEventListener 'click', function  e  {         var element = e.srcElement;         if  element.tagName === 'A'  {                 var url = getAnchorURL element ;                 if  isEvil url   {                         e.preventDefault  ;                         e.stopPropagation  ;                             Inform user that they clicked an "evil" link                 }         } }, false ;  So which are fired first, bubbling or captured event listeners? Does the event start at the element, bubble up, and then capture back down again, or does it start at the document? The WC3 specifies that events should capture down from the document, and then bubble back up again, which you can see in Figure 1-3. So, say we have the following document:                                   Test anchor                 Event Propagation      9  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 1-3. Capturing and then bubbling  If we click on the anchor, the events will be fired in the following order:  1. On the document  capturing  2. On the body  capturing  3. On divfoo  capturing  4. On the anchor  capturing  5. On the anchor  bubbling  6. On divfoo  bubbling  7. On the body  bubbling  8. On the document  bubbling   Internet Explorer’s .attachEvent .attachEvent has a couple more problems besides not supporting capturing events. With .addEventListener, the listener is called with this referring to the element on which the listener was fired  for example, the document or the body, not necessarily the anchor . The event also has a .currentTarget property containing the element. With .attachEvent, this refers to the window object and .currentTarget is unde- fined with no equivalent property, so if the same event listener is assigned to multiple elements we have no way of determining which element the event is being fired.  10      Chapter 1: Event Handling  www.it-ebooks.info   It also doesn’t have the e.stopPropagation   method, and instead has a .cancelBub ble property that must be set to true to cancel propagation. The equivalent of the code sample that I have been using throughout this section would be:  var elements = document.getElementsByTagName 'a' ; for  var i = 0; i < elements.length; i++  {          function  element  {                 element.attachEvent 'onclick', function  e  {                         var url = getAnchorURL element ;                         if  isEvil url   {                                 e.returnValue = false;                                 e.cancelBubble = true;                                     Inform user that they clicked an "evil" link                         }                 } ;         }  elements[i] ; }  We’ll add a fake e.stopPropagation method to our addEventListener function so that we can use it in our event listeners without having to test whether it exists:  function addEventListener element, event, handler  {         if  element.addEventListener  {                 element.addEventListener event, handler ;         } else if  element.attachEvent  {                 element.attachEvent 'on' + event, function  e  {                         e.preventDefault = function    {                                 e.returnValue = false;                         };                         e.stopPropagation = function    {                                 e.cancelBubble = true;                         };                          handler.call element, e ;                 } ;         } }  Triggering Events To trigger an event in jQuery, we can simply use the .trigger method on the element, which will simulate the event being triggered. It doesn’t, however, actually trigger a JavaScript event—it just cycles through all events set by .on  or any of the aliases, such as .click  and calls them. This means that it will only trigger event handlers set by jQuery, and any event handlers set using addEventListener will be ignored. There is no way to trigger events set using JavaScript using only jQuery.  Triggering Events      11  www.it-ebooks.info   To trigger events the way jQuery does it, we would have to have an array of events to which addEventListener adds whenever it is called, and then when .trigger is called, we’d have to cycle through them, executing the events that match the event type and element. Then, it would get slightly more complicated, as we would have to go up the tree, calling the event listeners for each parent element until something stops propa- gation or we hit the   element. This isn’t that difficult, though, as every element has a .parentElement property that returns an element’s parent. It’ll only return the one element, so we don’t need to worry about cycling through them, as it will not return a NodeList. We’re going to focus on the other method of triggering events, as we want it to work with event handlers added with pure JavaScript. It’s a lot trickier than the way jQuery does it—again, IE does it differently—but it is the only way that works when event listeners have been added via the standard JavaScript APIs  .addEventListener . First, we create the event using document.createEvent, and then we dispatch it using the dispatchEvent method on the element. Sounds simple, right? It isn’t. I’ll give you a generic solution, but there are many different types of events, and for each to work correctly, the methods called and arguments given to them need to be slightly differ- ent. Here is the generic solution:  var element = document.getElementById 'foo' ; var event = document.createEvent 'UIEvents' ; event.initUIEvent 'click', true, true, window, 1 ; var returned = element.dispatchEvent event ;  returned is set to the return value of any event handlers triggered. This can be useful for replicating jQuery’s functionality where the developer can return false to prevent the default action:  var element = document.getElementById 'foo' ;  element.addEventListener 'click', function    {         return false; } ;  var element = document.getElementById 'foo' ; var event = document.createEvent 'UIEvents' ; event.initUIEvent 'click', true, true, window, 1 ; var returned = element.dispatchEvent event ;  if  returned === false  {         event.preventDefault  ; }  That code should successfully call any event handlers, but it doesn’t set any of the often useful properties like the x and y positions of the mouse; if you want them, you will have to set them by modifying the event object:  12      Chapter 1: Event Handling  www.it-ebooks.info   var event = document.createEvent 'UIEvents' ; event.initUIEvent 'click', true, true, window, 1 ;  event.x = 100; event.y = 50;  var returned = element.dispatchEvent event ;  The event automatically bubbles, so there is no need to simulate that like you would have to with the other method. Triggering Events in Internet Explorer 8 Syntax-wise, triggering events in Internet Explorer is fairly similar to triggering events in other browsers, but it uses different functions. The following code fires the click event on the element with ID foo:  var element = document.getElementById 'foo' ; element.fireEvent 'onclick' ;  element.fireEvent has an optional second parameter: the event. It can be used like so:  var element = document.getElementById 'foo' ; var event = document.createEventObject  ; event.button = 1; element.fireEvent 'onclick', event ;  Again, if you want properties like the x and y positions of the mouse, you’ll have to add them yourself. event.button = 1 tells the event that it is a left click. It’s a lot less generic, and you can’t usually just change the name of the function without weird side effects—you would have to customize the code more for behavior like mouseover events. Writing a Wrapper Function to Trigger Events Writing a wrapper function for triggering events without a massive switch statement is difficult, and a tad hacky. I would usually recommend either having a function for each type of event you want to fire, or doing it how jQuery does it and storing an object of events that have been set. I’ve written the following wrapper function, but I wouldn’t really recommend using it; it is just to show you how you can use a single function to fire events in all browsers:  function triggerEvent element, event  {         if  element.dispatchEvent  {                 var evt = document.createEvent 'UIEvents' ;                 evt.initUIEvent event, true, true, window, 1 ;                 element.dispatchEvent evt ;         } else if  element.fireEvent  {  Triggering Events      13  www.it-ebooks.info                      Internet Explorer support                 var evt = document.createEventObject  ;                 evt.button = 1;                 element.fireEvent 'on' + event, evt ;         } else if  element['on' + event]  {                 element['on' + event].call  ;         } }  The last statement is to demonstrate how this function can work for older browsers that still use DOM 2. If the event has been initiated via the onclick attribute and the browser doesn’t support either .dispatchEvent or .fireEvent, then you can manually run the code using .call  .  To trigger events on multiple elements, you can use the same method that we used to add event handlers to multiple elements: loop through them.  Removing Event Handlers To remove an event in jQuery, we can just use the .off method on the element:  function clickHandler  {} $ 'foo' .click clickHandler ;     Either: $ 'foo' .off 'click', clickHandler ;     Or: $ 'foo' .off 'click' ;  The difference between the two calls to .off is that the first removes only the handler specified as the second argument, while the second removes all click handlers. Call- ing .off with no arguments would remove all event handlers of every type from that element  at least, ones set with jQuery . Note that you have to pass the exact function that you set, or the handler won’t be removed. The following code, for example, will not remove the event handler:     Does not work: $ 'foo' .click function   {} ; $ 'foo' .off 'click', function   {} ;  To remove an event handler in JavaScript, use JavaScript’s  .removeEventListener method. It doesn’t work in Internet Explorer 8:  14      Chapter 1: Event Handling  www.it-ebooks.info   var foo = document.getElementById 'foo' ; function clickHandler  {}  addEventListener foo, 'click', clickHandler ; foo.removeEventListener 'click', clickHandler ;  If we neglect to provide the last argument to .removeEventListener, then an error will be thrown. If you want to remove all event listeners of a certain event, you have to keep a record of them as you add them, and loop through them, removing them one by one  wrapper functions are very useful for this . Removing Event Handlers in Internet Explorer 8 To remove event handlers in Internet Explorer, we have to use the  .detachEvent function. It’s fairly similar to .removeEventHandler:  var foo = document.getElementById 'foo' ; function clickHandler  {}  addEventListener foo, 'click', clickHandler ; foo.detachEvent 'onclick', clickHandler ;  Writing a Wrapper Function to Remove Events As shown previously with triggering events, here I have written another basic wrapper function—but in this case, to remove events in all browsers: function removeEventListener element, event, handler  {         if  element.removeEventListener  {                 element.removeEventListener event, handler ;         } else if  element.detachEvent  {                 element.detachEvent 'on' + event, handler ;         } }  Unfortunately, this won’t be able to remove events set via addEventListener in In- ternet Explorer, as that function gives element.attachEvent a different callback than the one given to addEventListener. We can work around this by modifying addEven tListener to store the old callbacks and new callbacks in an object or array, which we can then loop through in removeEventListener to find the new callback. As noted, we could use either an object or array: in an object, we would somehow turn the original function into the key  if we just use the function as the key, then functions with the same code will override each other because they will be converted to strings  and store the functions by those keys. Then when we go to remove the event listener, we will turn the function back into the key using the same method, and  Removing Event Handlers      15  www.it-ebooks.info   then the generated callback will be grabbed and removed. To use an array, we would simply push the original function and the new function to an array and cycle through the array to find the event listener when we go to remove it. For the sake of simplicity, I’ll use an array in the following examples. Our new addEventListener:  var listeners = []; function addEventListener element, event, handler  {         if  element.addEventListener  {                 element.addEventListener event, handler ;         } else if  element.attachEvent  {                 var newHandler = function  e  {                         e.preventDefault = function    {                                 e.returnValue = false;                         };                         e.stopPropagation = function    {                                 e.cancelBubble = true;                         };                          handler.call element, e ;                 };                 element.attachEvent 'on' + event, newHandler ;                 listeners.push [handler, newHandler] ;         } }  And the updated  removeEventListener with support for Internet Explorer 8 and below:  function removeEventListener element, event, handler  {     if  element.removeEventListener  {                 element.removeEventListener event, handler ;         } else if  element.detachEvent  {                 event = 'on' + event;                 for  var i = 0; i < listeners.length; i++  {                         if  listeners[i][0] === handler  {                                 element.detachEvent event, listeners[i][1] ;                                 break;                         }                 }         } }  Adding a “Once Only” Event Listener jQuery’s .one method adds an event listener that will only be called once; once we call the event listener the first time, it will be removed and thus will not be called again. To do this in pure JavaScript, store a copy of the function in an object and then, in the event handler itself, call removeEventListener.  16      Chapter 1: Event Handling  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary This chapter has shown how you can use .addEventListener  and .attachEvent in Internet Explorer 8 and below  to add event handlers, and how you can use remove EventListener  and detachEvent in Internet Explorer 8 and below  to remove them. It  has  explained  the  basic  concepts  of  triggering  events,  as  well  as  how  events propagate.  Summary      17  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   CHAPTER 2 Constructors and Prototypes  Constructors are a way of creating objects, and can be initiated via the new keyword. Many instances of an object can be created. Prototypes are one of the more powerful features of JavaScript, and allow the developer to declare a method or property that all instances of an object will inherit. This chapter is less about building on your existing jQuery knowledge than teaching you a method you can use to enhance your jQuery code. To an extent, it will also help you understand how jQuery works, as jQuery itself uses prototypes. Constructors Constructors are functions that are called by the new keyword. For example:  function Greeting item  {         this.log = function    {                 console.log 'Hello ' + item + '!' ;         }; }  var hello = new Greeting 'world' ; hello.log  ;    Hello world!  Begin the names of your constructors with a capital letter; this will help you remember whether it is a function or a constructor. This is fairly common practice, so you should be able to recognize construc- tors in other people’s code, too.  It is possible to create the object and call a method on the same line, which can often be useful:  www.it-ebooks.info  19   new Greeting 'alien' .log  ;    Hello alien!  In other languages, the closest thing to constructors are classes. Classes have con- structor functions, which in that context are functions that are run when a class is used to create an object. It’s easier to specify code that should be run on creation in JavaScript:  function Greeting item  {         this.item = item;         console.log 'New greeting created.' ;             Do something else here          this.setItem = function  item  {                 this.item = item;         };          this.log = function    {                 console.log 'Hello ' + this.item + '!' ;         }; }  Unlike with classes, there is no way to run some code when the instance is destroyed  sometimes called a deconstructor in other languages, as opposed to the constructor , but you could add something like a .destroy method to the constructor function instead of using the traditional delete keyword to delete objects. Method Chaining In jQuery, you may have seen the following syntax used:  This is known as method chaining, as multiple methods are being called one after the other. It is possible to achieve this by using return this at the end of a function, which will return the object so that the function can be run again:  $ 'foo' .on 'hover', function    {            ... } .on 'blur', function    {            ... } ;  function Add number  {         if  typeof number !== 'number'  {                 number = 0;         }          this.add = function  num  {                 number += num;                 return this;         };  20      Chapter 2: Constructors and Prototypes  www.it-ebooks.info           this.log = function    {                 console.log number ;         }; }  We can then call it using the following code: new Add 10 .add 5 .add 1.5 .log  ;    16.5  jQuery  uses  method  chaining  quite  a  lot,  and  it  also  does  so  by  returning  this. Considering  the  first  code  sample  again,  we  can  see  that  the  call  to  $ 'foo'  .on 'hover'  must return the $ 'foo'  object. We can see this by looking at the jQuery source code; at the bottom of jQuery.fn.on is this code:                  return this.each  function   {                         jQuery.event.add  this, types, fn, data, selector  ;                 } ;  jQuery.fn.each  in  turn  returns  the  value  of  jQuery.each   this,  callback, args  , which is this:          each: function   object, callback, args   {                    ...                 return object;         },  Constructor, Not Function It is possible to call any function normally, which would result in an error or unex- pected behavior if it is a constructor. For example, if we call the last function we defined  Add from the method chaining example  as a normal function, it adds a couple meth- ods to the window object, and then throws a TypeError when we attempt to call the .add method; the Add function doesn’t return anything, and undefined has no add method. To work around this, we can simply put the following extract of code at the top of the function:  if  ! this instanceof Add   {         return new Add number ; }  This would make the function perform the same even if you omitted the new con- structor. It is fairly bad practice to rely on this, though, and should be avoided. Another approach would be to throw an error:  if  ! this instanceof Add   {         return new Error 'This is a constructor, not a function' ; }  That would be more useful in a library than in your own code, though  after all, you know that functions beginning with capital letters are constructors, right? .  Constructors      21  www.it-ebooks.info   Prototypes Prototypes allow the developer to create a method or property of an object that is inherited by all instances of that object. For example, look at the following piece of code:  function User id  {         this.id = id;          this.sendMsg = function  msg  {                    Do stuff here         };          this.getMsgs = function    {                    Do stuff here         }; }  Nothing wrong with this code, right? But imagine if we had hundreds, possibly thou- sands, of that object. Every instance of that object would have a copy of those two functions, which would use quite a bit of memory. If they’re exactly the same function on every instance of the object, why do we have to have copies of them instead of reusing the function? That’s exactly what prototypes do. If you add a method to the prototype of the function, then every function will inherit that method. We can rewrite the previous code as the following:  The preceding code would do exactly the same thing, but would use a lot less memory. It also has the advantage that if you edit the prototype of an object after a few of them have been initiated, the existing instances will also use the edited prototype:  function User id  {         this.id = id; }  User.prototype.sendMsg = function  msg  {            Do stuff here };  User.prototype.getMsgs = function  msg  {            Do stuff here };  function User id  {         this.id = id; }  var bob = new User 32 ; console.log bob.foo ;    undefined  22      Chapter 2: Constructors and Prototypes  www.it-ebooks.info   User.prototype.foo = 'bar';  console.log bob.foo ;    bar  This is because the methods and variables assigned to the prototype aren’t copied to the object, but when a method is called it first checks the object for that method, and then the prototype of the object, and then the prototype of the prototype, etc.  If you console.log an object in a good browser, you will be able to inspect the prototype of an object as well as the object itself. Figure 2-1 shows the console.log of an object that was created using var obj = new  Constructor  ; where  Constructor was defined as an empty function. Some properties were then set.  Figure 2-1. console.log to view a prototype  __proto__ is the prototype of the element.  jQuery uses prototypes on jQuery node lists. The $ function can be called hundreds, possibly thousands, of times. If jQuery copied every method and property over every single time, that would be quite costly, and your application would stop doing much very quickly. We assign methods by either calling the jQuery.fn.extend function— which cycles through the given object, adding methods to the prototype—or by adding them directly to jQuery.fn, like so:  jQuery.fn.log = function    {         console.log this ;         return this; };  We can test that this has worked by running the following code:  $ 'p' .log  ;  It should log all the paragraph elements in the document to the console.  Prototypes      23  www.it-ebooks.info   The reason that you’re adding methods to jQuery.fn and not jQuery.prototype is that the developers have decided that it looks nicer, and so have added something like the following line of code somewhere:  jQuery.fn = jQuery.prototype;  As  objects  are  passed  by  reference  and  not  copied,  jQuery.fn  is  equivalent  to jQuery.prototype and so any modifications to jQuery.fn will also be made to the prototype. .hasOwnProperty There is a handy function that will tell you whether a method or property is owned by the object or the prototype: .hasOwnProperty. For example:  var $document = $ document ; $document.log = function    {};  console.log typeof $document.log ;    function console.log typeof $document.css ;    function; no help here  console.log $document.hasOwnProperty 'log'  ;    true console.log $document.hasOwnProperty 'css'  ;    false  Editing the Prototype of Existing Objects It is also possible to edit the prototypes of objects that are defined by JavaScript, such as Array and String. This allows us to add useful methods to them—for example, a method that returns the sum of all the values in an array:  Array.prototype.sum = function    {         for  var sum = 0, i = 0; i < this.length; i++  {                 sum += this[i];         }          return sum; }  console.log [1, 2, 3].sum   ;    6  this refers to the object that the method is being called from, in this case [1, 2, 3]. The major fundamental difference between jQuery and the Prototype library is that jQuery doesn’t touch any prototypes—in fact, it doesn’t touch anything except the jQuery and $ variables—and Prototype modifies the prototypes of elements to add functionality to the language instead.  24      Chapter 2: Constructors and Prototypes  www.it-ebooks.info   While in theory it is possible to edit the prototypes of objects like NodeList  for ex- ample, to add a .forEach function , older versions of Internet Explorer throw an error if you try to access the prototype of an object that isn’t one of the five global objects  Array, Boolean, Number, Object, and String . It’s also pretty bad practice. Summary This chapter has shown you how to create constructor functions and create instances of them using the new keyword, and how you can chain methods by returning this in the method:  function Add   {         var number = 0;         this.add = function  num  {                 number += num;         };          this.getValue = function    {                 return number;         }; }  Object.prototype.foo = 'bar'; Add.prototype.hello = 'world';  var adder = new Add  ;  console.log adder.foo ;    bar console.log adder.hello ;    world  new Add  .add 4 .add 2 .add 5 .getValue  ;    11  We looked at prototypes—how every object inherits methods from the prototype of its constructor function, and the constructor function of that constructor function. We looked at how we can also modify the prototypes of built-in functions to enhance their functionality:  Finally, we looked at how we can use the .hasOwnProperty method to see whether a method or property belongs to an object, or the prototype of an object.  Summary      25  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   CHAPTER 3 DOM Traversal and Manipulation  The Document Object Model  DOM for short  is the API provided by the browser to enable you to view and interact with objects  such as elements  in HTML and XML documents. jQuery includes a number of functions that make working with the DOM a lot easier than with JavaScript alone, which can be pretty ugly. However, the func- tions provided by jQuery can be rather hefty  especially in older browsers , and it is often a lot faster to just use pure JavaScript. Therefore, it is important to know how both work. Selecting an Element In jQuery, there is only really one way to select an element, and that is with the CSS selector:  $ 'foo' ;  In JavaScript, there are several ways. You can select elements with their CSS selector  which I will cover later , but it isn’t supported in Internet Explorer versions earlier than 8, so I will cover the traditional methods first. You can select an element by its Id, ClassName, or TagName. The syntax is pretty similar for all of them:  document.getElementById 'foo' ; document.getElementsByClassName 'bar' ; document.getElementsByTagName 'p' ;  The first line, document.getElementById, gets the element with ID foo. As there can only be one element associated with each ID, there is no need to return a NodeList here, and it will return either the element or null.  www.it-ebooks.info  27   The second line, document.getElementsByClassName, gets all elements with “bar” as one of their classes. It will return the elements as a NodeList, which is similar to an array, as detailed later. The final line, document.getElementsByTagName, gets all paragraph elements and re- turns them as a NodeList. A NodeList is an object that acts like an array, but isn’t. This means that you can access the  elements  using  elements[i],  but  you  cannot  directly  use  array  methods like .splice and .forEach. You can, however, use them with the Array prototype:  var elements = document.getElementsByClassName 'bar' ; Array.prototype.slice.call elements, 2, 5 ;  The .slice call will return an array of elements, not a NodeList. This can also be used to convert NodeLists to arrays:  var elements = document.getElementsByClassName 'bar' ; console.log Array.isArray elements  ;    false  elements = Array.prototype.slice.call elements ; console.log Array.isArray elements  ;    true  If you’re using a decent browser, then you can probably log elements to the console using console.log. This allows you to see which ele- ments you have selected, and see what you can do with them next.  Selecting Elements with a CSS Selector It is possible to select elements using CSS selectors via .querySelector and .query SelectorAll:  document.querySelector 'foo' ; document.querySelectorAll '.bar' ; document.querySelectorAll '.bar span, foo' ; document.querySelectorAll 'a[href*="danger"]' ;  As demonstrated in the last example, it is possible to use CSS3 selectors  that will select all anchor elements with the word danger anywhere in their href . This isn’t supported in Internet Explorer, though—Internet Explorer only supports CSS2 se- lectors, and IE7 and below don’t support this function at all. When only making simple selections such as selecting a single element by ID or se- lecting some elements by class, it is far more efficient to use the traditional method of selecting them. See a benchmark here: http:  jsperf.com getelementbyid-vs-jquery-id.  28      Chapter 3: DOM Traversal and Manipulation  www.it-ebooks.info   The Prototype and MooTools libraries have aliases for document.querySelector and document.querySelectorAll: the $ and $$ functions. In addition to being aliases, they add support for browsers that do not support the functions natively  you can use a library such as Sizzle for this :  if  !document.querySelector  !document.querySelectorAll  {            Load library here }  function $ selector  {         return document.querySelector                 ? document.querySelector selector                  : customQuerySelector selector ; }  function $$ selector  {         return document.querySelectorAll                 ? document.querySelectorAll selector                  : customQuerySelectorAll selector ; }  Selecting Children Sometimes you may want to select the children of an element. With jQuery, this is again very easy:  $ 'foo' .children '.bar'   It’s  also  fairly  easy  in  JavaScript,  as  it  is  possible  to  use  the  .getElement... and .querySelector functions on elements, as well as the document:  document.getElementById 'foo' .getElementsByClassName 'bar' ;  Make sure that you don’t attempt to run any of them on a NodeList, though—it won’t work. Instead, you must loop through the elements. These functions only work on elements:     Does not work: document.getElementsByTagName 'p' .getElementsByClassName 'test' ;     This works: var elements = document.getElementsByTagName 'p' ,         allElements = [];  Array.prototype.forEach.call elements, function  element  {         children = element.getElementsByClassName 'test' ;         allElements = allElements.concat Array.prototype.slice.call children  ; } ;     This also works: document.querySelectorAll 'p .test' ;  Selecting Children      29  www.it-ebooks.info   Selecting the Next Element To select the next sibling of an element in jQuery, all we have to do is call the .next function:  $ 'foo' .next '.bar' ;  That would return foo’s next sibling with the classname bar. To do this with Java- Script alone is a bit more complicated, but we can do so by using .nextElementSi bling and a loop, like this:  var element = document.getElementById 'foo' ; element = element.nextElementSibling; while  element && element.className.indexOf 'bar'  === -1  {         element = element.nextElementSibling; }  In the loop, we check whether element is truthy, and if it isn’t, then we have reached the end of the list and there is no such element. If that is the case, then we break out of the loop and element will be null. Then, we check that the element has the class bar; if it doesn’t, then we continue the loop. If it matches, then we break out of the loop and element contains the element we were looking for. If we don’t want to match a selector, we can just use the .nextElementSibling property without the while loop  although you might still want to check that it exists . To find the previous element, you can use similar code, but with .previousElement Sibling. To find a parent element  .parent using jQuery , we can use .parentElement. To return all of an element’s siblings  like jQuery’s .siblings , you have to find the children of the parent element  .parentNode.childNodes  and then loop through, removing all nodes that aren’t elements, and removing the original element itself; obviously, an element cannot be its own sibling. We can use the following code:  var element = document.getElementById 'foo' ; var elements = element.parentNode.childNodes;  for  var siblings = [], i = 0; i < elements.length; i++  {     if  elements[i].nodeType === 1 && elements[i] !== element  {         siblings.push elements[i] ;     } }  console.log siblings ;  We’re using .push, as it is more efficient in this case. Converting a NodeList to an array effectively uses .push on every element, and then using .splice would do some additional work on top of that; it is more efficient to cycle through, running .push for all the elements we want.  30      Chapter 3: DOM Traversal and Manipulation  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating an Element Creating an element in jQuery is fairly simple, while it is pretty overcomplicated in JavaScript. Here is how to create an element in jQuery:  $ ' text ' .appendTo 'body' ;  There  are  two  ways  to  create  elements  in  JavaScript.  One  of  them  is  to  modify the .innerHTML of the element, but this should usually be avoided as it converts the element  in this case, the body  into HTML, adds the new HTML, and parses it back again. This means that any event listeners and formatting added on the fly will be lost. The other way—the correct way, in this context—is to create the element using docu ment.createElement, and then append it using .appendChild:     The wrong way, using innerHTML: document.body.innerHTML += ' text ';     The correct way: var newElement = document.createElement 'strong' ; newElement.setAttribute 'class', 'test' ; newElement.innerHTML = 'text'; document.body.appendChild newElement ;  Using  document.createElement  is  longer  and  more  complicated  than  adjusting the .innerHTML, but it is far more efficient. The .setAttribute method is fairly de- scriptive; it sets the  class attribute to  test  we could also have used the  .class Name attribute for this . You may have noticed that I used .innerHTML to set the text of the element; in this case, it is fine to change the HTML directly, as it is a blank element and thus it has no additional overhead beyond having to parse what you’re passing to it, which isn’t much. The alternative to modifying the .innerHTML would be to use document.createTextNode and append it to newElement using the newEle ment.appendChild method:  var newElement = document.createElement 'strong' ; newElement.setAttribute 'class', 'test' ;  var text = document.createTextNode 'text' ; newElement.appendChild text ;  document.body.appendChild newElement ;  Both are equally correct, but the first is shorter and more readable. Modifying an Existing Element If we want to modify the text of an element in jQuery  say, we want to replace all instances of the word swear with * , then we can use the following code:  $ 'foo' .text $ 'foo' .text  .replace  swear g, '*****'  ;  Creating an Element      31  www.it-ebooks.info   That only works on elements with no children; if you run it on an element with chil- dren, the child will be removed:   this  is  a  test  for  swears        this is a test for *****s   If we wanted to replace some text on an element with children, we would have to use .html instead of .text. This isn’t good, and is effectively the same as this Java- Script:  var element = document.getElementById 'foo' ; element.innerHTML = element.innerHTML.replace  swear g, '*****' ;  If the element has a lot of children, then this can be very inefficient, as it has to convert the entire tree to HTML, and then back again when it has been modified. Also, if any element has something like a className of swear, it will be replaced; you may want this behavior, but for the purposes of demonstration, we do not. A better solution would be to cycle through all the children of the element, checking what type it is. If it is a TextNode, then we run the swear regex, and if it is an element then we recurse, running the function again on that element:  var TEXT_NODE = 3,         ELEMENT_NODE = 1;  function replace element, find, replacement  {         var child, i, value,                 children = element.childNodes;          for  i = 0; i < children.length; i++  {                 child = children[i];                 value = child.nodeValue;                 if  child.nodeType === TEXT_NODE  {                         child.nodeValue = value.replace find, replacement ;                 } else if  child.nodeType === ELEMENT_NODE  {                         replace child, find, replacement ;                 }         } }  var element = document.getElementById 'foo' ; replace element,  swear g, '*****' ;  In the first two lines of this example, we define two constants, TEXT_NODE and ELE MENT_NODE. The reasoning behind this isn’t strictly relevant to the example, as we could have just used child.nodeType === 3, but using the constants makes the code more readable; after all, who has memorized all the values for nodeType?  32      Chapter 3: DOM Traversal and Manipulation  www.it-ebooks.info   While it is possible to use a string in the .replace call, it will be con- verted to a regex using new RegExp 'swear' , and so won’t be global, meaning that only the first instance of swear will be replaced.  Cycling Through Elements Cycling through elements can be useful for, say, adding an event listener to each of them individually or changing an attribute. In jQuery, cycling through a list of ele- ments is easy:  $ '.bar' .each function    {         $ this .css 'color', 'red' ; } ;  It is also quite easy in JavaScript:  var elements = document.getElementsByClassName 'bar' ; for  var i = 0; i < elements.length; i++  {         elements[i].style.color = 'red'; }  If you want to refer to the element as  this, you can use an anonymous function with .call to set the scope:  var elements = document.getElementsByClassName 'bar' ; for  var i = 0; i < elements.length; i++  {          function    {                 this.style.color = 'red';         } .call elements[i] ; }  It’s overkill to do that to merely change the color of a number of elements, but with larger changes it can be a lot cleaner than calling elements[i] every single time, and cleaner than assigning the element to a variable at every iteration of the loop  plus we could have the “last one only” problem—detailed in Chapter 5—if we added an event listener, which this approach solves without requiring an additional closure . Moving and Copying Elements It can be useful to be able to move and copy elements; for example, we may want to move a textarea to another point on a page when a button is pressed. We’re talking about moving the element in the DOM here, not necessarily on the page—the latter can be achieved relatively trivially using CSS. In jQuery, we can use the following methods to move and copy elements:  $ 'foo' .insertBefore $ 'bar'  ;    moves foo to directly before bar $ 'foo' .clone  .insertAfter $ 'bar'  ;    copies foo to after bar  Cycling Through Elements      33  www.it-ebooks.info   To move an element in pure JavaScript, we can use the .insertBefore method:  var foo = document.getElementById 'foo' ; var bar = document.getElementById 'bar' ; bar.parentNode.insertBefore foo, bar ;  .insertBefore uses a slightly strange syntax. You have to call it on the parent node, and send the element to insert  elementToInsert  and the element to insert it before  insertBeforeThis  as arguments  in that order :  element.parentNode.insertBefore elementToInsert, insertBeforeThis ;  To copy the element, we can simply call the .cloneNode method before calling in sertBefore:  var foo = document.getElementById 'foo' .cloneNode true ; var bar = document.getElementById 'bar' ; bar.parentNode.insertBefore foo, bar ;  The argument being passed to  .cloneNode  true in the previous example  should almost always be true. It tells JavaScript that you want to clone the entire tree  the children of the element , as well as the element itself. Setting this to false or omitting the argument entirely would just copy the children without cloning them, so making any changes to the children of the new element would change the children of the old element  and vice versa . Summary In this chapter, we have explored the Document Object Model and how you, the developer, can interact with it using JavaScript in the following ways:    Selecting elements using the traditional document.getElement functions   Selecting  elements  using  the  newer  document.querySelector  functions  using  CSS selectors    Selecting children and sibling elements   Creating elements using document.createElement   Modifying elements using .innerHTML and by cycling through them   Cycling through elements   Moving and copying elements using .insertBefore and .cloneNode  34      Chapter 3: DOM Traversal and Manipulation  www.it-ebooks.info   CHAPTER 4 AJAX  One of jQuery’s most used features is its suite of AJAX functions. They offer some significant improvements over the native JavaScript AJAX features, as they are a lot easier to use. AJAX is the act of making an HTTP request from JavaScript without having to reload the page; you could think of it as an inline HTTP request. Sometimes, however, it isn’t worth loading the entire jQuery library to send a few requests and nothing else, or it doesn’t provide enough control. It’s also useful to know how jQuery does it, as it can help you when you’re trying to debug your code. jQuery’s $.ajax function is also a massive 379 lines long at the time of writing. In this chapter, we will cover the basics of AJAX, explore a bit about designing a website to use AJAX, and then AJAXify an example piece of code. This chapter contains a bit of PHP, but PHP knowledge isn’t strictly necessary—it’s not complicated PHP and I will be explaining it along the way. Sending an AJAX Request To send an AJAX request in jQuery, we use this very simple syntax:  $.get ' ajax ?foo=bar', function  data  {         console.log data ;    The response } ;  Sending an AJAX request in JavaScript alone is a lot more complicated. To send an AJAX request, we use the XMLHttpRequest object  or ActiveXObject in older ver- sions of Internet Explorer . Here is an example of a basic AJAX request:  if  window.XMLHttpRequest  {         var req = new XMLHttpRequest  ; } else {            Internet Explorer         var req = new ActiveXObject 'Microsoft.XMLHTTP' ;  www.it-ebooks.info  35   }  var url = ' ajax ?foo=bar';  req.open 'GET', url, true ;  req.onreadystatechange = function    {         if  req.readyState === 4 && req.status === 200  {                 console.log req.responseText ;         } else if  req.readyState === 4  {                 throw new Error 'XHR Request failed: ' + req.status ;         } };  req.send  ;  That sends a GET request to  ajax ?foo=bar, and then if the request succeeds, logs the output to the console. If it fails, it throws an error. There are a few things that you should know about this example:    The third argument of req.open should always be set to true, as it tells the browser that you want to make the request asynchronous  runs in the background and then calls the callback, as opposed to blocking the page until the request returns . If set to false, it tells the browser that you want a synchronous request. This used to cause a memory leak in Firefox, so Mozilla disabled it; attempting to send a request synchronously now just throws an error. It was also bad practice to use it when it did work.    It is safe to use .onreadystatechange instead of adding an event listener, as we know that only one event listener will be added to it and nothing will be over- written. It  isn’t  worth  the  hassle  of  adding  support  for  both  .addEventListener  and .attachEvent.    req.readyState will always be set to 4, eventually. There is no need to have a  setTimeout to throw an error on timeout.    When sending GET requests, you should just append any data you want to send to the end of the URL  like you would for a normal HTTP request . We’ll cover POST requests in a bit.  Debugging For debugging AJAX requests, it is wise to have a simple echo script installed to which you can send data. Mine is written in PHP, but it doesn’t matter what language it is written in:  36      Chapter 4: AJAX  www.it-ebooks.info   echo json_encode array          'method'        => $_SERVER['request_method'],         'GET'           => $_GET,         'POST'          => $_POST   ;  <?php  ?>  That sample of code simply sends a JSON-encoded array of information: first, it sends the request method  usually GET or POST, but DELETE and PUT are also fairly common , and then it dumps the GET  $_GET  and POST  $_POST  information. This allows us to see exactly what has been sent. We can use JSON.parse to turn it into a JavaScript object when we receive it at the client side. JSON  JavaScript Object Notation  is a unified format for sending data with either native support or libraries written for almost every language. It was pioneered by Douglas Crockford, who also wrote JSLint and JSCheck. In JavaScript, we can use JSON.stringify to turn it into JSON, or JSON.parse to turn it back into a real Java- Script object. It and XML are the most commonly used formats for sending data over AJAX requests, although JSON tends to be more popular recently. I prefer JSON, as it offers better support and uses less bandwidth. Most APIs offer both XML and JSON. Debugging Sent AJAX Requests Most  good  browsers  have  an  option  in  the  console   usually  accessible  by  right- clicking  that, when enabled, will display all AJAX requests in the console. It can be helpful for seeing whether a request has actually been sent, and whether the problem is on the client side or server side. Some browsers will also log the returned data when this option is enabled, which can be helpful, as well. Sending POST Requests in JavaScript The syntax to send a POST request is mostly the same as that to send a GET request, with a couple of minor differences. The following code sends the same data to the same URL as this chapter’s first code example, but using POST instead of GET:  if  window.XMLHttpRequest  {         var req = new XMLHttpRequest  ; } else {            Internet Explorer         var req = new ActiveXObject 'Microsoft.XMLHTTP' ; }  Sending POST Requests in JavaScript      37  www.it-ebooks.info   var url = ' ajax '; var data = 'foo=bar';  req.open 'POST', url, true ;  req.setRequestHeader 'Content-type', 'application x-www-form-urlencoded' ;  req.onreadystatechange = function    {         if  req.readyState === 4 && req.status === 200  {                 console.log req.responseText ;         } else if  req.readyState === 4  {                 throw new Error 'XHR Request failed: ' + req.status ;         } };  req.send data ;  Data is sent using the same format as a query string, but is sent in req.send, not as part of the URL. When sending data, we also set the Content-type header to appli cation x-www-form-urlencoded. Writing a Wrapper Function Instead of writing out a large block of code every time you want to send an AJAX request, we can use a function that will accept arguments such as method, URL, data, and a callback:  function request method, url, data, callback  {         if  window.XMLHttpRequest  {                 var req = new XMLHttpRequest  ;         } else {                    Internet Explorer                 var req = new ActiveXObject 'Microsoft.XMLHTTP' ;         }          if  method === 'GET' && typeof data === 'string'  {                 url += '?' + data;         }          req.open method, url, true ;          if  method === 'POST' && typeof data === 'string'  {                 req.setRequestHeader 'Content-type',                         'application x-www-form-urlencoded' ;         }          req.onreadystatechange = function    {                 if  req.readyState === 4 && req.status === 200  {                         var contentType = req.getResponseHeader 'Content-type' ;                         if  contentType === 'application json'  {                                 callback JSON.parse req.responseText  ;  38      Chapter 4: AJAX  www.it-ebooks.info                           } else {                                 callback req.responseText ;                         }                 } else if  req.readyState === 4  {                         throw new Error 'XHR Request failed: ' + req.status ;                 }         };         req.send  typeof data === 'string' && method === 'POST'  ? data : null ;         return req; }  You can call it using the following code:  request 'GET', ' ajax', 'foo=bar', function  body  {         console.log body ; } ;  You may have noticed that the function includes some code that the original two samples did not; if the Content-type is set to application json, it attempts to parse it. jQuery does this, too; it’s pretty useful. You could also create some alias functions, like jQuery does:  function get url, data, callback  {         return request 'GET', url, data, callback ; }  function post url, data, callback  {         return request 'POST', url, data, callback ; }  A Simple Application of AJAX To demonstrate an application of AJAX, we will build a simple page that gets the time from the server. First we will build it without AJAX, and then we will add AJAX support  I’ll explain why I did it in that order in a bit . Let’s call our page ajax.php, and put the following in it:                 time                           The time   is:                   A Simple Application of AJAX      39  www.it-ebooks.info   As we reload the page, it will update. However, what if we want to update it using a button or automatically? We could use a button to refresh the page, or we could use AJAX. First, we will need to check whether the request is an AJAX request, and then if it is AJAX we will return only the value of time  . Save this as ajaxUpdate.php:  if  $_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH'] === 'XMLHttpRequest'  {         echo time  ; } else {         echo 'Please go to ajax.php and request this page using AJAX.'; }  <?php  ?>  This checks whether the request is an AJAX request, and if so it outputs the time. If not, it displays an error to the user. Then we can add the following code to the client side, in order to send the AJAX request:  function updateTime   {         get 'ajaxUpdate.php', '', function  time  {                 document.getElementById 'time' .innerHTML = time;         } ; }  Whenever updateTime is called, it sends a request to the server, and when it gets a reply it updates the element to display the updated time value. So the final ajax.php is as follows  use it with the original ajaxUpdate.php :                 time                         The time   is:                       Update time           <!-- functions.js should contain the get                 and addEventListener functions -->                                      var button = document.getElementsByTagName 'button' [0];                 addEventListener button, 'click', function    {                         get 'ajaxUpdate.php', '', function  time  {                                 document.getElementById 'time' .innerHTML = time;                         } ;                 } ;                40      Chapter 4: AJAX  www.it-ebooks.info   Designing a Site with AJAX There are two approaches to writing an AJAX-enabled website. The first is to write the AJAX to begin with, and the second is to design the entire site without AJAX and then add AJAX afterward. There are several advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Advantages of the first approach:    Easier and faster to develop, as it only requires one method to be developed instead  of an AJAX and a non-AJAX approach    Better support for modern browsers   More freedom, as you can use modern features without having to worry about  older browsers  Advantages of the second approach:    Easier  to  keep  JavaScript  and  HTML  separate,  as  the  HTML  doesn’t  rely  on    Better support for older browsers and browsers with JavaScript disabled  which  JavaScript  is surprisingly common   Summary In  this  shorter  chapter,  we  looked  at  AJAX:  using  the  XMLHttpRequest  object   or ActiveXObject in IE  to send both GET and POST requests, as well as using req.on readystatechange to get the data that the server sends back. I also explained a couple of ways you can debug sent AJAX requests, and I gave you a wrapper function that you can use to send requests without writing out a huge block of code every time. Finally, we looked at how we could add AJAX to a simple application, and covered a couple of different approaches to AJAXify applications.  Designing a Site with AJAX      41  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   CHAPTER 5 JavaScript Conventions  This chapter will cover some common conventions that you can use to improve your JavaScript. It covers topics such as making your code more readable by using com- ments and whitespace correctly, optimizing your code in order to improve perfor- mance, design patterns, and some common antipatterns  code that causes more prob- lems than it solves . Following the conventions in this chapter will significantly improve the performance and maintainability of your code, and you will find that both the quality of your code and your coding abilities will significantly improve. Writing JavaScript It is important when writing JavaScript to make your code as easy to read as possible. This makes your code easier to review, and easier to read back later  say, a couple of years down the road, when your project suddenly gains in popularity and a few bugs are found . It also means that if a developer wants to contribute to your project, or your project is passed on to another developer, that he can read and understand your code without having to study it for a long time beforehand. Comments By leaving comments in your code, you are ensuring that anyone who reads your code in the future will be able to tell what it does without having to dissect it. I generally leave comments before every function and at every line or block of code where it isn’t immediately clear what it does.  www.it-ebooks.info  43   A good example would be this:  var i = 0; while  true  {    Infinite loop until break is called         console.log i ;         i++;          if  i == 6  {                 break;         } }  The comments before functions generally have a special syntax. They are commonly called DocBlocks, and there are applications designed to parse them and create doc- umentation from them. DocBlocks usually follow this general syntax:   **  * Description of function.  *  * @param type name Description of parameter.  * @param int iterations This is an example.  * @returns type Description of return value.  *  function functionName   {            Do stuff here }  It shouldn’t go any more than a certain amount of characters wide—usually 79, as that is the maximum width of a terminal. You can simply wrap the lines, like this:   **  * Longer description of function here, wrapping multiple lines. The  * function does this, this, this, and this.  *  * @param int iterations This is an example.  * @returns type Description of return value.  *  function functionName   {            Do stuff here }  The items that are available depend on the documentation generator you’re using, but common ones include those listed in Table 5-1.  44      Chapter 5: JavaScript Conventions  www.it-ebooks.info   Table 5-1. Items available in DocBlocks Item Description Gives the author of the component. @author @constructor Marks the function as a constructor. Marks the function as deprecated.  @deprecated @description Some documentation parsers prefer @description to putting the description on the first line.  @namespace  @example  @extends  @ignore  @link  @param  @private  @public  @returns  @see  @since  @throws  @version  Shows an example code snippet. Says what the function or object extends  doesn’t really apply much to JavaScript, but it is good to know . Tells the documentation to ignore the block of code following the comment. Links to another class or function in the documentation  @sometag See here: {@link MyFunc tion} . Give the name of the namespace where the function resides. Describes a parameter of the function. Replaces @argument, which is deprecated. Marks the function as private, and it will not be shown in the documentation. Marks the opposite of @private, and implied if not specified. Describes what the function returns. Says to see another function  @see MyFunction . Says what version the function was added in. Says that the function may throw this error. Gives the version number of the file or class.  I’ve written a longer example containing multiple DocBlocks. As well as the DocBlocks before the comments that we have seen before, it also contains a DocBlock at the very beginning of the file to explain what the file does, and some basic info such as a version number and author information. This would also be where you’d put a copyright and license. The following code sample would be included into another project as a library:   **  * parser.js: Parses some text.  *  * @version 1.0.2  * @author Callum Macrae    *    **  * Parses some text.  *  * @constructor  * @example  *  var textParse = new Parser  ;  *  textParse.parse text ;  *  textParse.get 'name' ;  * @since 1.0.0  Writing JavaScript      45  www.it-ebooks.info    *  function Parser   {         this.data = {}; }   **  * Parses the text given to it.  *  * @param string text The string to parse.  * @returns object The parser object you called.  * @since 1.0.1  *  Parser.prototype.parse = function  text  {            Parse text...         return this; };   **  * The old function to add text to parse.  * Replaced with .parse: {@link Parser.prototype.parse}  *  * Will be removed completely in the near future.  *  * @deprecated  * @see Parser.prototype.parse  *  Parser.prototype.addText = function    {         return this.parse.call this, arguments ; };   **  * Gets some parsed data.  *  * @param string item The item to return.  * @returns string The item specified by the item  *  argument. If not found, will return null.  * @since 1.0.0  *  Parser.prototype.get = function  item  {         return this.data[item]; };  Coding Standards It is important to maintain good and consistent standards while coding. This, as I said before, is advantageous for multiple reasons—mostly because it is easier to read, both by yourself at a later date and by others.  46      Chapter 5: JavaScript Conventions  www.it-ebooks.info   Whitespace The easiest and best way to make your code easier to read is to use whitespace  both tabs and spaces . I’ll give you a few examples of how I use whitespace:     Calling functions  functionName 'test',[1,2,3] ;                      Not enough whitespace functionName 'test', [1, 2, 3] ;                   Just right functionName   'test ' , [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]  ;          Too much     Declaring variables  var a='foo',b='bar';       Not enough var a = 'foo',     b = 'bar';             Just right  although it could be on one line, too      If statements, while statements, etc.  if foo {            Do stuff }else{            Do other stuff }     Better: if  foo  {            Do stuff } else {            Do other stuff }     Indents  if  foo  { console.log 'test' ;    Needs indenting! }  if  foo  {         console.log 'test' ; }  As you can see in all those examples, the ones with more whitespace are more readable than the ones without. Too much whitespace, however, can have the same effect as not enough whitespace, and make the code tricky to read.  Writing JavaScript      47  www.it-ebooks.info   Curly braces Curly braces are used to denote either object literals or block statements, the latter of which group statements together as follows:  {         statement_1  ;         statement_2  ; }  if  comparison  {         statement_1  ;         statement_2  ; }  if  comparison          statement_1;  Curly braces are usually used with control flow statements such as if and while:  This control statement simply runs the statement directly after it, and the block state- ment has nothing to do with the if statement. In fact, the block statement is entirely optional, as you can see here:  However, because the control statement only runs the statement following it, if you decide at a later date to add another statement, you will need to add the curly braces. For that reason, I tend to just use the curly braces at all times, even when there is only one statement  it looks better, too . The topic of where to put curly braces is, in most languages, a bit of a holy war. The two usual contenders are braces on the same line:  if  test  {            Do something } else {            Do something else }  Or on their own line:  if  test  {            Do something } else {            Do something else }  Both make sense, both look fairly good, and both work. However, there are still some cases where the braces must go on the same line  for example, when you’re declaring an object . Also, anonymous functions don’t look good with the braces on their own line:  48      Chapter 5: JavaScript Conventions  www.it-ebooks.info      Excerpt someFunction 'test', function    {            Do something } ;  For this reason, a lot of developers who usually put braces on their own line  usually because they’re not primarily JavaScript developers  put the braces for anonymous functions on the same line. This can result in samples of code like the following, which doesn’t look good at all:  var obj = {         test: function    {                 for  var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++                  {                         if  typeof arguments[i] === 'string'                          {                                 handleString arguments[i], function    {                                         return {                                                 foo: 'bar';                                         };                                 } ;                         }                         else                         {                                 handleOther arguments[i] ;                         }                 }         } };  It’s inconsistent and messy, and the reason that I recommend that you put the braces on the same line in all cases.  Naming conventions Inconsistent naming conventions make it difficult to remember and work out variable names. While there isn’t really a wrong way to name variables, it is very important that you keep them consistent. Here are the most common ways of naming variables and functions:     Camel caps var thisVarName = ''; function myFunction   {}     Underscores var this_var_name = ''; function my_function   {}     All lowercase var thisvarname = ''; function myfunction   {}  Writing JavaScript      49  www.it-ebooks.info      Underscores with capitals var This_Var_Name = ''; function My_Function   {}  JavaScript itself uses the first—camel caps—in its native functions. For this reason, code that uses camel caps tends to look better than code that uses a different naming convention, and camel caps tend to be most widely used. The second convention demonstrated, underscores, is also pretty commonly used, but isn’t as popular in JavaScript as it is in some other languages. Throughout this book, I have been using camel caps. Literals Notation JavaScript has literal notations available for stuff like creating new objects and arrays, which allow you to shorten your code and make it clearer. It is better to use literals than the constructor functions, such as new Object   and new Array  , and I’ll ex- plain why using a few examples. Object Literals The object literal simply uses curly braces. Here are two ways of defining exactly the same object:     Using the literal syntax var obj = {};     Using the constructor function  antipattern  var obj = new Object  ;  The most obvious reason to use the literal syntax instead of the constructor function is that it is shorter to type, but there are a couple more reasons. The literal syntax never has scoping issues—if, for example, you accidentally call a variable Object, you would overwrite the object constructor, and you would not be able to create any more objects using the constructor function. This can never happen to the literal syntax. In a similar vein, the parser doesn’t have to do any scope resolution with the literal syntax. If you use the literal syntax, JavaScript knows exactly what you mean and gives you an object. If you use the constructor function, however, then JavaScript has to check the current scope, then cycle up through the parent scopes until it finds the Object constructor. The first uses fewer resources and is slightly quicker. Finally, you can declare properties using the literal notation:     Using the literal syntax var obj = {         foo: 'bar',         hello: 'world' };  50      Chapter 5: JavaScript Conventions  www.it-ebooks.info      Using the constructor function  antipattern  var obj = new Object  ; obj.foo = 'bar'; obj.hello = 'world';  Other Literals Sometimes the constructor offers features that the literal does not, and so the con- structor should be used. For example, with Array objects, you can send an integer argument to the constructor, and it will specify the length of the array. This can be useful for repeating a string:  var repeats = 6; var str = 'test '; str = New Array repeats + 1 .join str ; console.log str ;    test test test test test test  Unlike the literal, the RegExp constructor accepts string input, so you can concatenate user input into it  which you cannot do with the literal :  var re = new RegExp '\nUser: ' + username + '\n', 'g' ; Table 5-2 lists constructors and their corresponding literals. Table 5-2. Constructors and literals Constructors var obj = new Object  ;  Literals var obj = {};  var ary = new Array  ;  var ary = [];  var re = new RegExp '[a-z]+', 'g' ; var re =  [a-z]+ g  var str = new String  ;  var num = new Number  ;  var str = '';  var num = 0;  var bool = new Boolean  ;  var bool = false;  Optimizations Optimizing  your  code  can  make  it  faster  and  use  fewer  resources.  A  micro- optimization, which I will demonstrate in this section, is an optimization that improves the performance of the script by a negligible  not noticeable  amount. When you’re running an application on a server, improving the performance of a script by a couple of microseconds can improve the application’s overall performance by reducing the response time of the server by a couple of microseconds per request, freeing it up for other requests. However, on the client side, micro-optimizations are less important because the user won’t notice a few microseconds’ difference.  Optimizations      51  www.it-ebooks.info   Strictly speaking, micro-optimizations should be the job of the browser. However, not all browsers have fast JavaScript engines, and some people would argue that the day when micro-optimizations are no longer necessary is not yet here. However, it is important to know a few of the most effective micro-optimizations for JavaScript; if you’re writing code that could be used on the server side or on very old browsers, micro-optimizations could help. To read about optimizing your code in far more detail than I could fit into a section of a chapter, check out High Performance JavaScript by Nicholas C. Zakas. Algorithms The easiest and most efficient way of speeding up your script and lowering resource usage is to design your algorithms more efficiently. For example, if you’re implement- ing a sorting algorithm to order some elements and you’re comparing every element with every other element, why not just compare it to the nearest ones? This area is more algorithm design than JavaScript, so I won’t be covering it here. This type of optimization doesn’t usually count as a micro-optimization, as it can often noticeably speed up your script. Caching Variables When looping through an array or NodeList, you generally call the .length property at every iteration. Every time you read that property, the length has to be calculated, which can be expensive. Instead, you can cache the length in a variable:  for  var i = 0, l = ary.length; i < l; i++  {            Do something here }  When finding an element using jQuery, you’d be wise to cache it instead of calling the jQuery function multiple times: $ 'foo' .click function    {         $.myFunc $ 'foo' , function    {                 $ 'foo' .show  ;         } ;         $ 'foo' .hide  ; } ;     Better: var foo = $ 'foo' ; foo.click function    {         $.myFunc foo, function    {  52      Chapter 5: JavaScript Conventions  www.it-ebooks.info                   foo.show  ;         } ;         foo.hide  ; } ;  This is a minor improvement, though, and makes the code slightly harder to read; if you want to know what element a variable contains, you might have to scroll back a bit. parseInt parseInt takes a string and returns a parsed number. However, it also contains some additional functionality that you may not need, which will slow the function down. In such a case, you can use new Number 12  to convert a string into a number without the additional overhead: parseInt '35' ;    35 new Number '35' ;    faster  parseInt '21.8' ;    21 new Number '21.8' ;    21.8  parseInt '3 dogs' ;    3 new Number '3 dogs' ;    NaN  typeof parseInt '3' ;    number typeof new Number '3' ;    object  One thing to bear in mind is that the latter method returns an object, not a number:  The easiest way to convert the string into an actual number is to precede it with +, the unary operator:  typeof +new Number '3' ;    number  It is worth noting that unless you’re going to be using typeof on the number, you don’t need to cast it to a number—as soon as you perform an arithmetic operation with the object, it will be treated as a number anyway. This is how we changed the type in the previous example. Loops In addition to the preceding code  caching the length , there are other ways to increase the speed of a loop. You can cycle through the loop backward:  for  var i = array.length; i--;  {            Do something }  As this only runs one statement per loop, it performs twice as well. When i hits zero, the loop will be stopped. Even faster still for this is the while loop:  Optimizations      53  www.it-ebooks.info   Minimize Repeated Expressions Instead of repeating the same code multiple times, it is more efficient to store it in a variable. For example:  var i = 100; while  i--  {            Do something }  var top = 10 *  x   7 + y   5 ; var bottom = 5 *  x   7 + y   5 ; var left = 4 *  x   7 + y   5 ; var right = 13 *  x   7 + y   5 ;     Better: var factor =  x   7 + y   5 ; var top = 10 * factor; var bottom = 5 * factor; var left = 4 * factor; var right = 13 * factor;  Functions There are multiple conventions involving functions that you can use to improve your code. Declarations Versus Expressions Function declarations and function expressions perform in different ways and can be used to complete different tasks. As demonstrated here, there are three types of func- tions:  a  declared  function,  an  anonymous  function,  and  a  named  function.  For example:     Function declaration function test   {            Do something }     Anonymous function expression var test = function    {            Do something };     Named function expression var test = function test    {            Do something };  54      Chapter 5: JavaScript Conventions  www.it-ebooks.info   You may have noticed two slight differences in the coding standards of function ex- pressions and function declarations. As a personal preference only, I have placed a space before the parentheses in the expressions but not the declaration. This is to mark them as function expressions, as it sometimes isn’t clear at first glance:   function test    {            Do something }   ;  test  ;    Error; not defined  I also put a semicolon after the function expressions, as dumb minifiers prefer it; you can put a function declaration on one line with stuff after it without a semicolon, but a function expression must be followed by a semicolon. As previously noted, declarations and expressions both perform differently. Much like variables, function declarations are hoisted  placed at the beginning of the scope  and so can be called before they’re actually defined. For example, the following code works fine  although it doesn’t actually do anything :  test  ; function test   {            Do something }  It performs slightly strangely, though; the function will be hoisted even if the block of code will never be run. This can result in weird situations like the following:  test  ;    false  if  true  {         function test   {                 return true;         } } else {         console.log 'test' ;    will never be called         function test   {                 return false;         } }  That doesn’t happen with anonymous or named function expressions. Function Callbacks There are conventions regarding the correct usage of anonymous and named func- tions as callbacks. The only alternatives to using an anonymous function as a callback are to use setInterval to check whether the function has changed a variable and run some code when it has, or use eval:  Functions      55  www.it-ebooks.info      Warning: antipattern! function call func  {         eval func + '  ' ; }  Obviously, that function is dangerous and vulnerable. A slightly better example can be explained using event handling.  The following code isn’t actually possible, but imagine that it is for this example.  onEventSetToTrue will set clicked to true when foo is clicked:  var clicked = false; onEventSetToTrue 'foo', 'click', clicked ;  function handler   {         if  clicked  {                 clicked = false;                    Do something else         } }  setInterval 'handler  ', 100 ;  This isn’t nearly as efficient as just giving it a callback, as there can be a delay. Also, if you click the element more than once in 100 ms, the event handler will only be called once. Even the previous example should have used a callback; we’re effectively using eval when we give setInterval a string. It also looks nicer when we use a callback:  $ 'foo' .click function    {            Do something } ;  If Invoking Self-Defining Functions A  self-invoking  function  is  an  anonymous  function  that  is  defined,  and  then  run straightaway. It is mainly useful for resolving scoping issues:  jQuery plug-ins use it for accessing the jQuery variable as $ without overwriting any existing variable that could have been defined by other libraries, and to prevent pol- lution of the global namespace:   function    {            Do something }   ;   function  $  {            Do something }  jQuery ;  Self-invoking functions can also have the parentheses to call the function inside the wrapper parentheses, but it is more common to find them outside:  56      Chapter 5: JavaScript Conventions  www.it-ebooks.info    function    {            Do something }   ;  Self-defining functions use a similar concept, and are good for resolving browser com- patibility issues. For example, consider the following code:  function matchesSelector element, selector  {         if  element.matchesSelector  {                 return element.matchesSelector selector ;         } else if  element.webkitMatchesSelector  {                 return element.webkitMatchesSelector selector ;         } else if  element.mozMatchesSelector  {                 return element.mozMatchesSelector selector ;         }            else call a library here }  There are a couple of disadvantages to using this code. Every time the function is called, it has to potentially check a few properties of the element until it finds what it needs, and the library needs to be loaded even if it isn’t going to be used. We can use the  following  code  instead,  which  uses  the  special  kind  of  self-invoking  function known as a self-defining function:  var matchesSelector =  function    {         if  HTMLElement.prototype.matchesSelector  {                 return function  element, selector  {                         return element.matchesSelector selector ;                 };         } else if  HTMLElement.prototype.webkitMatchesSelector  {                 return function  element, selector  {                         return element.webkitMatchesSelector selector ;                 };         } else if  HTMLElement.prototype.mozMatchesSelector  {                 return function  element, selector  {                         return element.mozMatchesSelector selector ;                 };         }            Load library here         return function  element, selector  {                    Call library here         }; }   ;  It’s quite a bit longer, but it is far more efficient. Not only does the function not need to check what exists every single time despite the fact that it won’t ever change, but the function also gives us a convenient place to load the library so that the library will only ever be loaded when it is actually needed.  Functions      57  www.it-ebooks.info   Code Reuse It is far harder to maintain code when it is repeating itself. The action of DRYing your code  where DRY is Don’t Repeat Yourself  moves repeating code into functions and assigns identical strings to variables. It leads to easier-to-read and easier-to-maintain code, and also reduces the footprint of the code, making it use less bandwidth. Con- sider the following code sample, which takes a few elements and moves them 10 pixels right and 10 pixels up:  What happens if you decide that you want to move the elements 20 px instead of 10 px? You have to change every value manually. If you have a good code editor, it is easy to change them, but it is better to not have to. You could also use a variable, but that would create some very ugly code:  $ 'foo' .css 'top', '-=10px' ; $ 'foo' .css 'left', '+=10px' ; $ 'bar' .css 'top', '-=10px' ; $ 'bar' .css 'left', '+=10px' ; $ 'hello' .css 'top', '-=10px' ; $ 'hello' .css 'left', '+=10px' ; $ 'world' .css 'top', '-=10px' ; $ 'world' .css 'left', '+=10px' ;  var dist = 10; $ 'foo' .css 'top', '-=' + dist + 'px' ; $ 'foo' .css 'left', '+=' + dist + 'px' ; $ 'bar' .css 'top', '-=' + dist + 'px' ; $ 'bar' .css 'left', '+=' + dist + 'px' ; $ 'hello' .css 'top', '-=' + dist + 'px' ; $ 'hello' .css 'left', '+=' + dist + 'px' ; $ 'world' .css 'top', '-=' + dist + 'px' ;  It is better to do something like this:  ['foo', 'bar', 'hello', 'world'].forEach function el  {         $ el .css 'top', '-=10px'                  .css 'left', '+=10px' ; } ;  Now you only have to change two values. This is far easier to change without making any significant edits; imagine this example over thousands of lines, with hundreds of operations. Common Antipatterns In addition to being aware of the common conventions, it is important for you to be aware of the common antipatterns, too. You should actively avoid any of the code that you find in this section.  58      Chapter 5: JavaScript Conventions  www.it-ebooks.info   Using eval eval runs  evaluates  the string given to it as JavaScript code:  var code = 'console.log "test" ;'; eval code ;  The preceding code simply logs “test” to the console. eval is used fairly commonly by developers who don’t know how to do something without it. For example, the following example is sometimes used to access a property of an object. It is an antipattern, as there is an easier way to do it:  var property = 'testProperty'; var value = eval 'obj.' + property ;     Preferred: var value = obj[property];  In general, if you’re using eval, you’re doing it wrong. eval is such a problem because it opens up your code to potentially execute unsafe operations. It is generally used to accept input from the user, or receive code from a remote server. If you’re receiving data from an external source, you don’t know that the data hasn’t been tampered with, and thus you could be executing malicious code. If accepting input from the user, you don’t need to use eval, so you shouldn’t. In addition to passing code to the eval function itself, there are other, similar ways of evaluating code from strings that you should avoid. You can pass code to  set Interval and setTimeout in strings, and the Function object accepts a string:  setInterval 'console.log "test" ', 1000 ; setTimeout 'someFunction  ', 1000 ; new Function 'console.log "test" ' ;  Don’t do that! with The with statement was designed to offer a shorthand way to access properties of an object. Unfortunately, it doesn’t always behave quite as expected and can be confusing, so you should avoid it. When you attempt to access a variable within a  with statement, the browser first checks whether the object has that property, and if not, it accesses the variable nor- mally. Consider the following code:  with  obj  {         a = b; }  Common Antipatterns      59  www.it-ebooks.info   What does it do? It could be doing any one of the following:  a = b a = obj.b obj.a = b obj.a = obj.b  Without going back and looking at the object, we have no idea what is happening. It is also slower than accessing the object or variable directly. document.write document.write is a function used commonly in tutorials to demonstrate outputting values. Basically, it outputs whatever is given to it:             document.write 'Hello world!' ;    Output:           Hello world!    That is  usually  as far as the tutorials take it, besides conditionals and variable output. There is almost no situation where document.write is a useful function to have; for outputting elements, there is document.createElement, and for debugging, there is console.log, which is a far superior function because it supports outputting objects, elements,  and  functions  as  well  as  text,  numbers,  and  Boolean  values  like  docu ment.write. In addition, document.write behaves differently depending on where it is called; if it is called after the document has finished loading, it will entirely overwrite the existing DOM, destroying the page. Common Design Patterns Design patterns are conventions that will help you with the design or structure of your code, and can be used on your code to solve a common problem. As many developers have used them before us, you can be fairly sure that these patterns will solve your problem in a clean and efficient way. In this section, I will explain a few of the more common design patterns and how they can be implemented in JavaScript. This is not a fully comprehensive guide to design patterns in JavaScript. To find out a lot more about this topic, I would recommend Learning JavaScript Design Patterns by Addy Osmani, which in addition to being published by O’Reilly, is available as a free book online.  60      Chapter 5: JavaScript Conventions  www.it-ebooks.info   The Singleton Pattern You would implement the Singleton pattern, in other languages, by creating a class with a method that creates a new instance of a class if one doesn’t exist, or return that object if it already does. It is used in languages where only the current scope is checked, instead of the current scope and then all the parents. So, in short, implementing the Singleton pattern is as simple as just creating an object:  var demoSingleton = {         foo: 'bar',         hello: function    {                 return 'Hello world!';         } }  There is no need to do anything special. That hasn’t really explained Singleton very well; there is no easy way to explain it in JavaScript. The following information isn’t really necessary unless you want to know what the Singleton pattern actually is, so if you aren’t interested in that or don’t know PHP  which is what I will be using to explain it , you can skip to the next subheading. The following code sample is bad code, as it uses globals:  <?php  class MyClass {            ... } $myClass = new MyClass  ;  function myFunction   {         global $myClass;            ... }  It is better to not use globals, so instead we create a static class  which is automatically global  and use it to get the object:  <?php  class MyClass {            ... } class MyClassSingleton {         private $myClass;         public static function get   {                 if  !is_object $this->myClass   {                         $this->myClass = new MyClass  ;                 }                 return $this->myClass;         }  Common Design Patterns      61  www.it-ebooks.info   }  function myFunction   {         $myClass = MyClassSingleton::get  ;            ... }  $myClass is then an instance of the MyClass object. The Factory Pattern The Factory pattern is a creational pattern that helps create objects. It creates a generic interface for creating objects without using a constructor, where we can specify the type of the factory object to be created. This pattern is easiest to explain by example. We’re going to be simulating a real factory in the following code example:  function Ford options  {         this.color = options.color  'blue';         this.year = options.year  new Date  .getFullYear  ; }  function Mini options  {         this.color = options.color  'red';         this.model = options.model  'Cooper'; }  function CarFactory  {} CarFactory.prototype.carType = Ford;    Default is ford CarFactory.prototype.createCar = function  options  {         if  options.carType === 'mini'  {                 this.carType = Mini;         } else if  options.carType === 'ford'  {                 this.carType = Ford;         }          return new this.carType options ; };  var factory = new CarFactory  ; var mini = factory.createCar {         carType: 'mini',         model: 'One' } ;  We can then see by logging the mini variable to the console that it is an instance of the Mini object. You can also use instanceof to confirm this.  62      Chapter 5: JavaScript Conventions  www.it-ebooks.info   Another approach would be to have an object telling the .createCar method where all the cars are instead of having an if-else statement. This makes it easier to add other cars, and it also means that cars can be added on the fly. For example:  function Ford options  {         this.color = options.color  'blue';         this.year = options.year  new Date  .getFullYear  ; }  function Mini options  {         this.color = options.color  'red';         this.model = options.model  'Cooper'; }  function CarFactory  {} CarFactory.prototype.carType = Ford;    Default is ford CarFactory.prototype.carTypes = {         ford: Ford,         mini: Mini }; CarFactory.prototype.createCar = function  options  {         if  options.carType && this.carTypes[options.carType]  {                 this.carType = this.carTypes[options.carType];         }          return new this.carType options ; };  Be careful where you use the Factory pattern. If the problem doesn’t require this pat- tern, then using it could make your code unnecessarily complicated. It’s most useful where initiating the object is complex, or where a lot of small objects need to share the same properties or methods. The Iterator Pattern The Iterator pattern is a commonly used design pattern that makes it very easy to iterate through the elements of an aggregate object. For example, consider the fol- lowing code:  var element, elements = new ElementIterator '.foo' ; while   element = elements.next     {         console.log element ; }  That code simply loops through all elements with className foo, logging them to the console. What is special, however, is how the code is getting the elements; instead of looping through them with a  for loop, we’re using a  while loop with a call to elementIterator.next. This can have a few advantages over just a for loop, such as the ability to add a .previous method as well as a .next method and go backward and forward as required.  Common Design Patterns      63  www.it-ebooks.info   The following is an example implementation of the ElementIterator function that would allow the previous code to run:  function ElementIterator selector  {         this.elements = document.querySelectorAll selector ;         this.currentElement = -1; }  ElementIterator.prototype.current = function    {         return this.elements[this.currentElement]; };  ElementIterator.prototype.hasNext = function    {         return !! this.elements[this.currentElement + 1] ; }; ElementIterator.prototype.next = function    {         if  this.hasNext    {                 this.currentElement++;                 return this.current  ;         } else {                 return undefined;         } };  The  .next  and  .hasNext  methods  can  easily  be  adapted  for  both  .previous  and .hasPrevious. It is also common to see a .reset or .restart method, which would reset this.currentElement to 0 and return the first element. The Facade Pattern The final design pattern that I will be covering here is also among the smallest and simplest design patterns. Facade  or sometimes façade, the French word from which it  originates   means  “frontage”;  that  is,  obscuring  what  goes  on  underneath  with something different. Basically, a facade function is a function that calls a number of other functions in order to make a process simpler for the user. For example, given two functions, func tion1   and function2  , the following is an example of the Facade pattern in action:  function functions1and2   {         function1  ;         function2  ; }  That’s simple enough. The usage of the Facade pattern has a couple of advantages and disadvantages. It makes the code easier to read and is DRYer, but it can hit performance when using this pattern; you’ve got to consider how significant that performance impact is and wheth- er it is worth it.  64      Chapter 5: JavaScript Conventions  www.it-ebooks.info   In jQuery, $.fn.css and $.fn.animate are examples of facade functions, as they call multiple internal functions without actually doing much themselves. Summary In this chapter, we have explored some common conventions in JavaScript, and how using them can help both your code and your ability to write it. We also explored antipatterns, specifically how they can have a detrimental effect on your code and thus should be avoided. We also looked into a few of the more common design pat- terns, and how using them can improve the structure of your code. Here are a few conventions we discussed:    Comments and DocBlocks.   Coding standards, such as the use of whitespace, the naming of variables and  functions, and the placement of curly braces.    Literal  notations  versus  using  the  constructor  functions  such  as  Array  and  Function.    Optimizations,  including  demonstrations  of  a  few  micro-optimizations  and  questioning whether they’re really necessary.    Function declarations versus expressions, the function callback pattern, and self-  defining and self-invoking functions.    The basic concepts of code reuse, and DRYing your code.   Some common antipatterns, including the use of eval, the with statement, and  document.write.

Summary      65  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   APPENDIX A JavaScript Basics  JavaScript is a versatile, lightweight, and easy-to-use scripting language. It is most often used in websites and web-based applications, although it is becoming increas- ingly common to find it used on the server side using a server-side implementation of JavaScript such as Node.js. Some desktop and mobile applications are even starting to use JavaScript and HTML5. Due to the wide usage and huge popularity of JavaScript, many libraries have been written for it, a few of which include jQuery, YUI, Dojo, and MooTools. jQuery is currently the most popular, with 85% of the market share and thousands of contrib- utors. Many major projects are built off jQuery, such as jQuery Mobile, Twitter Boot- strap, and jQuery UI. It is also extremely fast—Apple and Google’s fight for the fastest JavaScript engine  Safari’s Nitro and Chrome’s V8 engine, respectively  has pushed the engineers at both companies  to  improve  the  speed  of  the  engines  to  the  point  where  micro- optimizations are almost entirely unnecessary. JavaScript  is  a  very  forgiving  language,  and  often  developers  can  make  mistakes without them having an effect on the site; browsing the Internet with the JavaScript console open often displays errors on many big websites. Unfortunately, this has the side effect of allowing the developers to make mistakes of which they are not made aware, and they develop bad habits that they may then pass on to other people. A lot of online tutorials, and often even books, contain misleading or incorrect information, and will lead the reader into bad habits.  www.it-ebooks.info  67   Hello World! This appendix is a quick explanation of what you can do in JavaScript, explained mostly from your existing jQuery knowledge. If you’re not confident with your Java- Script abilities or only know jQuery, it is definitely worth reading this chapter; while you may know some of the material it covers already, it is definitely good to have it explained properly. I’ll be explaining the basic features of JavaScript, such as strings, functions, and vari- ables, primarily using examples; they’re fairly easy to pick up. To display output in this chapter, we will be using the built-in console.log function. This simply outputs the arguments passed to it into the browser’s JavaScript console. This function doesn’t work in IE8 and older versions of Firefox, and will throw an error if you try to use it. Throughout the appendix, I’ll be using Google Chrome for examples and demon- strations. You can access the console in Chrome in View → Developer → JavaScript Console  it is also worth getting into the habit of using the keyboard shortcut: Option- Command-I in OS X, or Ctrl-Shift-I in Windows . For example, the following code logs “Hello World!” to the console, as shown in Figure A-1:  console.log 'Hello World!' ;    Hello World!  Figure A-1. “Hello World!” in the console  The “undefined” that you can see in Figure A-1 is the return value of the code that was run, which in this case is undefined, as the function didn’t return anything. We can also return values to view them, instead of using console.log. For an example of that, see Figure A-2.  68     Appendix A: JavaScript Basics  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure A-2. “Hello World!” in the console  returned   We passed a string to console.log. You’ll probably have used strings in jQuery and in any other programming language you’ve worked with. A string is just a collection of characters wrapped in quotes  either single or double : "This is a string". Unlike with some other languages, single quotes and double quotes behave exactly the same; it doesn’t matter which you use. You can concatenate  join  two strings together using the + operator:  console.log 'Hello ' + "World!" ;    Hello World!  The same character is also used to add numbers together  this time, as the unary operator . We’ll cover numbers in more detail later:  console.log 2 + 3 ;    5  Comments Comments are easy in JavaScript, and you have probably already used them when writing jQuery. A comment is simply a note in the code that you can read to refami- liarize yourself when you come back to that code later. The JavaScript engine will ignore it:     This is a comment, and won't be parsed  Comments are also commonly used to prevent the execution of some code, which can be useful when debugging your code:   * This comment spans multiple lines *   console.log 'one' ;    one   console.log 'two' ;    will not run console.log 'three' ;    three  Comments      69  www.it-ebooks.info   Variables Variables are also pretty easy. Again, you have likely used them when writing jQuery, but you may have been using them wrong  for example, by not declaring them . You must declare all variables using var. For example:  var foo = 'bar'; console.log foo ;    bar  Due to the forgiving nature of JavaScript, it won’t actually complain if you don’t declare the variable, but you may encounter debugging issues because such a variable does not behave the same as one that has been declared. JavaScript has what is known as a function scope, which determines where variables can be accessed from based upon where they were defined. For example, a variable declared within a function will become “local” to that function, which means that it can only be accessed from within that function, or any functions declared within that function. Any variable declared outside a function will become “global,” and can be accessed from anywhere, including in functions. For example:  var a = 'foo'; function test   {         var b = 'bar';         console.log a ;    foo         console.log b ;    bar } test  ; console.log a ;    foo console.log b ;    ReferenceError: undefined  In this code sample, we can see that the variable a, defined outside the function, can be accessed from within the function. The variable b can be accessed from within the function, but not outside of the function like a can. A variable declared outside a function, but modified inside the function without being redeclared, will stay modified:  var a = 'foo'; var b = 'bar'; function test   {         a = 'test';         var b = 'Hello!';         console.log a ;    test         console.log b ;    Hello! } test  ;  console.log a ;    test console.log b ;    bar  70     Appendix A: JavaScript Basics  www.it-ebooks.info   This code sample is similar to the previous one, but a is changed—and stays changed. It also shows us that variables declared inside the function that are also declared out- side the function do not overwrite the old value, which is still the same after the function has been called.  While some tutorials and websites may tell you that omitting the var declaration is safe and just declares the variable globally, this is very bad practice and should not be done unless the variable has been de- clared in a parent scope.  Numbers You can perform arithmetic operations in JavaScript:  console.log 2 + 2 ;    4 console.log 4 - 2 ;    2 console.log 4 * 2 ;    8 console.log 6   2 ;    3  We can also use noninteger numbers:  console.log 3.5 + -2 ;    1.5 console.log 5.75 - 2.2 ;    3.55  You can use the parseInt and parseFloat functions to convert a string into a number. parseInt ignores anything after the first decimal place, meaning  that  it  will  always  return  a  whole  number,  while  parse Float returns the number exactly as it displays. For example:  console.log parseInt '122'  ;    122 console.log parseInt '1.8'  ;    1 console.log typeof parseInt '122'  ;    number console.log parseFloat '3.5'  ;    3.5 console.log typeof parseFloat '3.5'  ;    number  We can perform some more complicated arithmetic tasks using the built-in  Math object:  console.log Math.round 3.4  ;    3 console.log Math.ceil 3.4  ;    4 console.log Math.pow 2, 10  ;    1024  To see a full list of functions in the Math object, you can consult the documentation at the MDN website.  Numbers      71  www.it-ebooks.info   The Assignment Operators When working with a variable that has a numeric value, you can use the following shortcuts to modify the value:  var x = 2; x += 7;    x = x + 9  9  x -= 1;    x = x - 1  8  x *= 2;    x = x * 2  16  x  = 4;    x = x   4  4   var x = 2; x++;    x = x + 1  3  x--;    x = x - 1  2   As a further shortcut, there are operators for incrementing and decrementing a vari- able by one. They’re the same as in other languages:  You can also use the += operator for strings  but using any of the other assignment operators with strings will return NaN :  var x = 'Hello '; x += 'world!';    Hello world!  Functions There are two main ways of defining a function in JavaScript: the function declaration and the function expression. For example:  Function expressions can either be named or anonymous. They have a fairly similar syntax, but the named function has a .name property, which can be used for back- tracing, usually by the browser:     Function declaration function greet name  {         console.log 'Hello ' + name + '!' ; }     Function expression  anonymous function  var greet2 = function  name  {         console.log 'Hello ' + name + '!' ; };     Anonymous function expression var greet3 = function  name  {            ... }; console.log greet3.name ;    blank string     Named function expression  72     Appendix A: JavaScript Basics  www.it-ebooks.info   var greet4 = function greet  name  {            ... }; console.log greet4.name ;    greet  It is worth noting that the .name property is not actually part of the JavaScript spec- ification, and attempting to access it will result in an error in Internet Explorer—if you want global support for your code, you shouldn’t use this property. A function declaration and a function expression look and behave in very similar ways, but the former is hoisted, meaning that it appears at the top of the scope  the function or file  so that it can be called before it is actually defined. Function expres- sions also look much better as arguments for other functions  we’ll get to that in a bit . We use the same syntax to call each type of function:  greet 'Alien' ;    Hello Alien! greet2 'World' ;    Hello World!  Hoisting Example As foo is a function declaration, it is hoisted, meaning that it goes at the beginning of the scope—either the top of the page  in this case  or the top of the function. This means that it is available before it is defined from the top of the scope, so typeof foo returns function. As bar is only a function expression, it isn’t available until after it has been defined, so typeof bar returns undefined:  console.log typeof foo ;    function console.log typeof bar ;    undefined  function foo   {} var bar = function    {};  This behavior can have some pretty weird side effects. For example:     Example one function test   {         return 'one'; }  console.log test   ;    two  function test   {         return 'two'; }     Example two if  true  {         function test2   {  Functions      73  www.it-ebooks.info                   return 'one';         } } else {         function test2   {                 return 'two';         } }  console.log test2   ;    two  We can work around both of these example scenarios fairly easily by using a function expression. Variable declarations are also hoisted, but that affects you as a developer far less than function hoisting does  which is why it was mentioned here, not under the string section . Only the declaration itself is hoisted; the actual assignment is not. The only real effect this has is that if you define a variable as a later point in the function, you cannot access the variable from a parent scope:  var a = 'foo';  var b = function    {         console.log a ;    undefined         var a = 'bar'; }; b  ;  As it is common practice to put all variable function declarations at the top of the function  and it is definitely something that I would encourage you to make a habit of , this isn’t a massive issue. Functions as Arguments Functions can also be sent as arguments to functions, like this:  function call func, data  {         func data ; }  call function  a  {         console.log a ; }, 'Test' ;  This function, while slightly more complicated than any of the previous code examples in this book, is actually pretty simple. First, we define a function that simply calls the function sent to it  in this case, the anonymous function , and then we call it. This sort of syntax is used a lot in jQuery, usually for callbacks:  $ 'a.bounce' .click function    {            Do something with the element } ;  74     Appendix A: JavaScript Basics  www.it-ebooks.info   This code, when jQuery detects that a.bounce has been clicked, calls the anonymous function. Returning a Value We can also return a value from a function:  function product a, b  {         return a * b; }  console.log product 2, 4  ;    8 console.log product 10, 0  ;    0  function blank   {            no return statement }  console.log blank   ;    undefined  If we do not specify a return value, undefined is returned:  Objects An object is a way of storing a collection of indexed data. Again, it is easiest to explain with an example:  var your_obj = {         foo: 'bar',         otherIndex: 2 + 2 };  console.log your_obj.foo ;    bar console.log your_obj.otherIndex ;    4  The object is defined using curly braces, and allows data to be stored by keys  known as properties . This notation is known as the object literal notation. We can access and modify objects using the dot operator, and delete items using the delete keyword:  your_obj.foo = 'test'; console.log your_obj.foo ;    test  delete your_obj.foo; console.log your_obj.foo ;    undefined  var obj = {         foo: {                 foo: 'bar'  You can store any type of data in an object, including other objects.  Objects      75  www.it-ebooks.info   Here is where it starts to get a little more complicated, though. Almost everything is an object in JavaScript  which is why we can use functions as arguments . For example, we can treat a function like an object, setting and accessing properties and methods:          } };  console.log obj.foo.foo ;    bar  var foo = function    {}; foo.hello = 'world'; console.log foo ;    function    {} console.log foo.hello ;    world  console.log foo.length ;    0  As demonstrated here, objects have built-in properties that they inherit from the ob- ject  from  which  they  were  created   in  this  case,  the  Function  object . 'string'.length would return the length of the string, which in this case is 6, and  function  {} .length would return the number of arguments it accepts, which in this case is 0. Objects also have built-in methods: console.log 'string'.toUpperCase   ;    STRING  MDN  Mozilla Developer Network  has some extremely good JavaScript references. It has a list of all the string methods here, where you can find all the methods for the other objects, like Arrays and Objects. Just as functions can be treated as objects, we can have variables that are accessible as both an object and a function. This is how jQuery’s $ variable works. We can simulate the behavior using the following code:  function $ selector  {         return document.querySelectorAll selector ; }     Loops through elements $.each = function  array, cb  {         for  var i = 0; i < array.length; i++  {                 cb.call i, array[i], array ;         } }  var paragraphs = $ 'p' ;    returns all paragraphs $.each paragraphs, function  index, paragraph  {            ... } ;  76     Appendix A: JavaScript Basics  www.it-ebooks.info  This isn’t exactly how jQuery works  the function returns a real NodeList instead of a jQuery node list, which is covered in Chapter 3 , but the principle is the same.   Finding the Type of a Variable You can use the typeof operator to find out what type of data a variable contains. This has a lot of practical applications, such as checking whether variables are the correct type  e.g., checking whether the input in a string function is in fact a string  or check- ing whether a variable is defined:  var str = ''; console.log typeof str ;    string console.log typeof 4 ;    number console.log typeof {} ;    object  The five types are string, number, object, function, and boolean. It can also return undefined, which means that the variable hasn’t been defined. Sometimes the operator can return some weird things:  console.log typeof null ;    object console.log typeof NaN ;    number  A variable that is null doesn’t contain anything; it’s sort of a halfway point between undefined and an empty string. NaN means “Not a Number,” and is returned when you try to do impossible mathematical operations such as "a"   2. To work around these, you can use the following:  var null_var = null; console.log null_var === null ;    true console.log isNaN NaN  ;    true  We’ll learn more about the === operator in “Comparison Operators”  page 83 ; it just means “equal to.” Arrays Arrays are similar to objects, but their contents are accessed differently and they do not have properties like objects, just numeric values known as indexes:  var foo = ['one', 'two', 'three'];  console.log foo[0] ;    one console.log foo[2] ;    three  As with pretty much everything in computing, lists are indexed from the number 0. Arrays have a number of built-in methods that you can use to modify the array. To add new items to arrays, you can use the .push method:  Finding the Type of a Variable      77  www.it-ebooks.info   var foo = ['one', 'two']; foo.push 'three' ;  console.log foo[0] ;    one console.log foo[2] ;    three  To delete an item from the array, you can use the .splice method. In addition to deleting items, .splice also allows you to add new items to the middle of the array:  var foo = ['one', 'junk', 'more junk', 'three']; foo.splice 1, 2, 'two' ;  console.log foo[0] ;    one console.log foo[2] ;    three  This deletes two items from the item with index 1  junk  and replaces them with two. The third argument is optional, so you can just delete items without replacing them, too:  var foo = ['one', 'two', 'junk', 'three']; foo.splice 2, 1 ;  console.log foo[0] ;    one console.log foo[2] ;    three  Consult MDN to see a full list of the array methods available. Detecting an Array As typeof [] returns "object", we cannot use it to detect an array. Instead, we can use the instanceof operator or the Array.isArray function:  console.log [] instanceof Array ;    true console.log Array.isArray []  ;    true  The instanceof operator isn’t too reliable, as it can be tricked into returning the wrong answer. The best way of detecting an array is definitely to use the  Array.isArray function. However, it is relatively new  it was introduced in JavaScript 1.8.5 , and thus isn’t supported in Internet Explorer 7 and lower. There are two ways around this. The first is to use jQuery’s jQuery.isArray function:  console.log $.isArray []  ;    true console.log $.isArray {}  ;    false  The second workaround is to create the Array.isArray function if it doesn’t exist. The following snippet of code is from MDN:  if !Array.isArray  {   Array.isArray = function  vArg  {     return Object.prototype.toString.call vArg  === "[object Array]";   }; }  78     Appendix A: JavaScript Basics  www.it-ebooks.info   This can be called the same way Array.isArray is called. Looping Loops are found in nearly every modern computing language, and are a very powerful feature. Their name is fairly descriptive: loops allow you to repeat the same block of code. This is good for, say, looping through arrays of objects. The for Loop The first loop we’ll look at is the for loop. It is a common way of looping through arrays:  var foo = ['one', 'two', 'three']; for  var i = 0; i < foo.length; i++  {         console.log foo[i] ; }  This results in the three elements being individually logged to the console. The loop is, again, quite simple: var i = 0 defines i as 0; i < foo.length returns false when i is not less than foo.length, stopping the loop; and i++ is the equivalent of i = i + 1, as explained in “Numbers”  page 71 . The first statement, var i = 0, is run once, before the first iteration. The third state- ment, i++, is run every single time. The second statement is the conditional that tells the loop when to stop looping. If the result of the second statement is either false or 0, then the loop stops running  null, undefined, or a blank string won’t stop the loop . In modern browsers, there is a more elegant solution available for looping through arrays. If you have used a language such as PHP, you will have used the foreach loop before.  This  was  introduced  in  JavaScript  recently,  so  doesn’t  have  support  in  all browsers, but it is a lot cleaner  although slightly different from implementations in other languages . The following code outputs exactly the same as the previous code example:  var foo = ['one', 'two', 'three']; foo.forEach function  value, index  {         console.log value ; } ;  For support in older browsers, it is worth either using a for loop or a loop from a library.   MDN  also  has  a  workaround  for  this  to  add  .forEach  support  in  older browsers; check out the .foreach page.  Nearly all libraries have functions like this, and jQuery is no exception. The  jQuery.each function behaves in a very similar manner to the foreach loop:  Looping      79  www.it-ebooks.info   var foo = ['one', 'two', 'three']; $.each foo, function  index, value  {         console.log value ; } ;  That will output the same as both the previous loop examples. There  is  another  method  that  is  similar  to  Array.forEach:  Array.map.  It  cycles through the array, running the given function on each element, and creating a new array from the return values, which is then returned, leaving the original array intact. For example, the following code will take an array of numbers and return an array of those numbers squared:  var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 10];  var newNumbers = numbers.map function  number  {         return Math.pow number, 2 ; } ;  console.log newNumbers ;    [1, 4, 9, 25, 100]  Similarly to Array.forEach, jQuery provides a function so that you can use this be- havior in browsers that don’t support map natively. As you can see, it is fairly easy to use:  var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 10];  var newNumbers = $.map numbers, function  number  {         return Math.pow number, 2 ; } ;  console.log newNumbers ;    [1, 4, 9, 25, 100]  It behaves exactly the same, and leaves the original array intact. For a map function that would work in every browser without jQuery, you can use a for loop:  var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 10],         newNumbers = [];  for  var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++  {         newNumbers.push Math.pow number, 2  ; }  console.log newNumbers ;    [1, 4, 9, 25, 100]  The while Loop The while loop executes the contained code while a given conditional is true:  80     Appendix A: JavaScript Basics  www.it-ebooks.info   This outputs the numbers 0 to 99. The reason it wouldn’t output 100 is that i is in- cremented after it is logged to the console, meaning that when it hits 100, i < 100 will return false and the loop will be stopped. Developers use a while loop fairly often to count down instead of using a for loop to count up. If order doesn’t matter  or you need to go backward , cycling through back- ward can be a lot more efficient, as there is only one statement per iteration  i-- , as opposed to two with a for loop  i <= 100 and i++ . The following code will output the numbers 99 to 0 inclusive:  The do-while Loop The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but the conditional is after the code block, which changes the behavior slightly and ensures that the loop will always be run once:  With loops such as in the preceding subsection’s while loop example, do-while will behave exactly the same. The following code will output the numbers 0 to 99:  var i = 0; while  i < 100  {         console.log i ;         i++; }  var i = 100; while  i--  {         console.log i ; }  var i = 0; do {         i++; } while  false ; console.log i ;    1  var i = 0; do {         console.log i ;         i++; } while  i < 100 ;  The break and continue Statements You can use break to break out of any loop, and you can use continue to stop executing the code block and move to the next iteration. The following code sample is an example of the break statement. It is similar to the previous code sample, but will only output the numbers 0 to 50, as when i++ increases i to 51, i > 50 will return true and break will be called, stopping the loop:  Looping      81  www.it-ebooks.info   var i = 0; while  i < 100  {         console.log i ;         i++;         if  i > 50  {                 break;         } }  var i = 0; while  i < 100  {         console.log i ;         i++;         continue;         if  i > 50  {                 break;         } }  var foo = {         one: 1,         two: 2 };  The break statement can be useful if the conditional to stop a loop is too big; you can make the loop infinite using while  true , and then have the break statement in an if statement—or have a couple of if statements. You should be careful while doing this, though, as messing up the conditional in the if statement would cause a real infinite loop. The following example demonstrates the continue statement. It expands on the pre- vious example, but the continue before the if statement will ensure that the break statement will never run; the numbers 0 to 99 will be logged:  for..in statements for..in statements are used to loop through an object:  for  var prop in foo  {         console.log prop + ': ' + foo[prop] ; }  This outputs  one:  1 and then  two:  2. As you can see, it assigned  prop to be the property, not the value itself, so the value had to be retrieved via foo[prop].  82     Appendix A: JavaScript Basics  www.it-ebooks.info   Conditional Statements The if Statement The if statement executes some code if a given conditional is true:  if  true  {            Execute code } if  false  {            Code here won't be executed }  In addition to the simple if statement, you can also use else if and else:  if  i < 10  {            i is less than ten } else if  i < 15  {            i is less than 15 and more than or equal to ten } else {            i is more than or equal to 15 }  Comparison Operators As seen in the for and while loops, it is possible to use < to determine whether one number is smaller than another number. There are also a number of other comparison operators listed in Table A-1. Table A-1. Comparison operators  examples return true  Operator Description ==  Example 4 == "4"  'a' === 'a'  The two inputs are equal. The two inputs are the same. The two inputs are not equal. The two inputs are not the same. The first input is less than the second input. The first input is greater than the second. The first input is less than or equal to the second. 2 <= 2 The first input is greater than or equal to the second. 5 >= 3  7 != 4  2 < 6  4 !== "4"  "f" > "c"  ===  !=  !==  <  >  <=  >=  The difference between == and === is that === checks whether the inputs are the same type, while == does not. For example, 0 == false and '0' == 0 would return true, while 0 === false and '0' === 0 would not.  Conditional Statements      83  www.it-ebooks.info   Objects  including arrays and functions , when compared via == and ===, act slightly differently than strings and numbers; these operations will return true if the objects are the same, but false if they aren’t:  var ary = [], obj = {}; console.log ary == [] ;    false console.log ary === [] ;    false console.log ary == ary ;    true console.log obj === obj ;    true  If you want to compare two objects or arrays, you must loop through them and com- pare the contents. Comparing objects and arrays can be useful in testing libraries  in fact, it is often essential .  When comparing two different objects, check the lengths before loop- ing  through  them;  if  they’re  not  the  same  length,  then  you  know they’re not the same and so there is no need to loop through them.  Logical Operators Logical operators are used to group multiple conditional statements together; see Table A-2. Table A-2. Logical operators  examples return true  Operator Description &&  Example true && true  “And”: both are true. “Or”: one is true. Negates the value given to it. !false  false  true    !  For example:  if  age   25  {            age is either less than 18 OR above 25 }  if  age > 18 && gender === 'male'  {            age is greater than 18 AND gender is male }  if  !age  {            age is falsy }  84     Appendix A: JavaScript Basics  www.it-ebooks.info   You  can  use  two  negation  logical  operators  to  cast  a  variable  to Boolean  true or false :  console.log !!'' ;    false console.log !!7 ;    true  In an if statement, you don’t need to cast the variable to Boolean.  Falsy values In the last comment in the preceding code example, I referred to a variable as falsy. A falsy variable is one where it evaluates to false; it is either false, undefined, '', 0, or null. Everything else is truthy. In the aforementioned example, it was probably either 0 or ''  assuming that we’re accepting input from a form . In the context of an if statement, statements that return falsy will cause the block to not be evaluated: if  false  {            will not be run } if  undefined  {            will not be run } if  ''  0  null  {            will not be run }  Any other value  a truthy value  will cause the block to be evaluated:  if  []  {            will be run } if  'Hello world!'  {            will be run } if  -1  {            will be run }  The switch Statement The switch statement executes a block of code specified by a value:  var foo = 'bar'; switch  foo  {         case 'a':                 console.log 'This will not be logged' ;                 break;          case 'bar':  Conditional Statements      85  www.it-ebooks.info                   console.log 'This will be logged' ;                 break;          case 'foo':                 console.log 'This will not be logged' ;                 break; }  The statement will take the value given to it  in this case, bar  and run the code from the given case statement until it hits a break statement or the closing parenthesis. In the preceding code, the switch statement will run the code from case 'bar': to the break  on  the  line  below  the  console.log,  meaning  that  it  will  be  the  only  con sole.log called. We can also have multiple case statements:  var foo = 'bar'; switch  foo  {         case 'a':                 console.log 'Will not be logged' ;                 break;          case 'bar':         case 'foo':                 console.log 'Will be logged' ;                 break; }  Then, while Will be logged will be logged if foo is equal to bar, it will also be logged if foo is equal to foo. There is one more statement: the default statement. If no cases match the variable, then the default statement will be called:  switch  foo  {         case 'bar':                 console.log 'Will be called if the foo variable equals bar' ;                 break;          default:                 console.log 'Will be called if foo equals anything else' ;                 break; }  We’ll use a new object, Date, for a more complicated example of a switch statement:  switch  new Date  .getDay    {         case 5:                 console.log 'Friday!' ;                 break;          case 6:         case 0:  86     Appendix A: JavaScript Basics  www.it-ebooks.info                   console.log 'Weekend!' ;                 break;          default:                 console.log 'Weekday :- ' ;                 break; }  The Date object is a native JavaScript object for performing date and time functions. new Date   creates a new instance of the Date object with the current date and time, and the .getDay   method returns the day of the week where 0 is Sunday and 6 is a Saturday. If we omit the break statement, the code will “fall through,” and both the current case and the next will be executed:  switch  new Date  .getDay    {         case 0:         case 6:                 console.log 'The week has passed' ;          case 5:                 console.log 'Thursday has passed' ;          case 4:                 console.log 'Wednesday has passed' ;          case 3:                 console.log 'Tuesday has passed' ;          case 2:                 console.log 'Monday has passed' ; }  On Wednesday, both “Tuesday has passed” and “Monday has passed” will be logged, and on the weekend everything will be logged. On Monday, nothing will be logged. This technique is often considered fairly bad practice—it can sometimes make de- bugging difficult, and if you accidentally miss a break statement, it will make your code behave strangely and will be difficult to catch. I would say that it’s fine to use in moderation, but be very careful. If you’ve only got one bit of code per case, then it can often be a lot easier  and certainly a lot cleaner and easier to debug  to just use an object. The following three code samples will do exactly the same thing:     Using a switch statement:  switch  randLetter    {         case 'A':                 console.log 'The function returned A' ;  Conditional Statements      87  www.it-ebooks.info                   break;          case 'E':                 console.log 'This time, the function returned E' ;                 break;          case 'I':                 console.log 'I!' ;                 break;          case 'O':                 console.log 'Oh, the function returned "O"' ;                 break;          case 'U':                 console.log 'You? Ewe? Yew?' ;                 break;          default:                 console.log 'The function returned an inferior letter' ;                 break; }     Using an object var letters = {         A: function    {                 console.log 'The function returned A' ;         },         E: function    {                 console.log 'This time, the function returned E' ;         },         I: function    {                 console.log 'I!' ;         },         O: function    {                 console.log 'Oh, the function returned "O"' ;         },         U: function    {                 console.log 'You? Ewe? Yew?' ;         },         default: function    {                 console.log 'The function returned an inferior letter' ;         } };  var letter = randLetter  ; if  letters[letter]  {         letters[letter].call  ; } else {         letters.default  ; }  88     Appendix A: JavaScript Basics  www.it-ebooks.info      Or even: var letters = {         A: 'The function returned A',         E: 'This time, the function returned E',         I: 'I!',         O: 'Oh, the function returned "O"',         U: 'You? Ewe? Yew?',         default: 'The function returned an inferior letter' };  console.log letters[randLetter  ]  letters.default ;  Delays There are two functions built into JavaScript that allow you to implement a delay into your code. The first, setTimeout, calls the given function after a specified time interval  specified in milliseconds, a thousandth of a second . The following code waits one second and then logs “Hello world!” to the console:  setTimeout function    {         console.log 'Hello world!' ; }, 1000 ;  As JavaScript is an asynchronous language, this would not stop the code below from running. The following code would log one to the console after 500 ms, and then two 500 ms after that. To have one logged 500 ms after two was logged, we would either have to adjust the time on the second timeout to be 1,500 ms, or we would have to put it in the anonymous function that is being called by the first setTimeout:  setTimeout function    {         console.log 'two' ; }, 1000 ;  setTimeout function    {         console.log 'one' ; }, 500 ;  The second function that allows you to work with delays is setInterval, which calls the given function every x milliseconds, instead of just once like setTimeout does. The code function logs “Hello world!” to the console every two seconds:  setInterval function    {         console.log 'Hello world!' ; }, 2000 ;  When you call either setTimeout or setInterval, it returns a number that can then be passed to clearTimeout or clearInterval to stop the timeout or interval from running:  Delays      89  www.it-ebooks.info   var id = setInterval function    {         console.log 'Hello world1' ; }, 500 ;  setTimeout function    {         clearInterval id ; }, 5050 ;  That code would log “Hello world!” to the console twice a second for five seconds, at which point it would stop. The 5,050 is to ensure that it happens 10 times; if it were 5,000, it would only happen nine times, and it could be misunderstood if 5,500 were used. clearTimeout works the same way; setTimeout returns an ID that can then be passed to clearTimeout to cancel the running of the timeout. Obviously, if the timeout has already run, clearing it won’t do anything. Regular Expressions Regular expressions, commonly known as “regex” or “RegExp,” are a very powerful tool used to parse data. To people who haven’t met them before, regular expressions can seem to have a somewhat confusing syntax, but as you learn and get used to them, they become clearer and easier to write. As regular expressions aren’t exclusive to JavaScript—the syntax most commonly used is from Perl—I won’t explain regular expressions themselves, just how to use them in JavaScript. To find out more about regular expressions generally, read Mastering Regular Expressions by Jeffrey E. F. Friedl. There are two ways to create a regular expression in JavaScript. The first is the pre- ferred way, but if you want to accept user input into the regular expression, then you have to use the second:  var regex =   ?:foo + g; var regex2 = new RegExp '^' + username + ':  .+ $', 'i' ;  The first method utilizes the RegExp literal, while the second just creates a new instance of the RegExp object. Both methods have the same end result, but the first is more readable and slightly more efficient; I have explained why in greater detail in Chap- ter 5. For the regex variable,  ?:foo + is the regular expression itself, and g is the modifier. For the regex2 variable, '^' + username + ':  .+ $' generates the regular expres- sion, and the i modifier is used. There are two main methods used to execute regular expressions, .exec and .test. Both are methods of the regular expression and accept a string input:  90     Appendix A: JavaScript Basics  www.it-ebooks.info   var regex =  ^hello ig;    tests whether string begins with "hello" regex.test 'Hello world!' ;    true regex.exec 'Hello world!' ;    ["hello"] regex.test 'Foo bar' ;    false regex.exec 'Foo bar' ;    null  .test  returns  a  Boolean  value  denoting  whether  the  regex  matches  the  string, while .exec returns the array. Any capturing groups return their contents as part of the returned array  they wouldn’t affect the output of .test, though :  var regex =  ^hello  [^ ]+ !$ i; regex.exec 'Hello world!' ;    ["Hello world!", "world"]  Regular Expressions in String Functions Some string functions also accept regular expressions as arguments:  "abcdefg".split  [ce] g ;    ["ab", "d", "fg"] "abcdefg".search  [ce] g ;    2 "abcdefg".match  [ce] g ;    ["c", "e"] "abcdefg".replace   ce  g, 'x' ;    abxdxfg  For .match and .replace, remember to use the global modifier. If you don’t, only the first instance will be matched and the output will be very different, as demonstrated in  the  following  example.  You  don’t  need  to  use  the  global  modifier  for  .split and .search, as .split seems to ignore it and .search only returns the index of the first instance anyway:  "abcdefg".split  [ce]  ;    ["ab", "d", "fg"] "abcdefg".search  [ce]  ;    2 "abcdefg".match  [ce]  ;    ["c"] "abcdefg".replace   ce  , 'x' ;    abxdefg  Error Handling The JavaScript way of handling errors is fairly similar to how errors work in other languages. We can throw errors using a throw statement:  throw new Error 'This is an error' ;  This will display the error in the console, as you can see in Figure A-3.  Error Handling      91  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure A-3. Throwing an error  All runtime errors are thrown like this as well. You can catch and handle errors using a try-catch statement, like in other languages:  try {         throw new Error 'Test' ; } catch  e  {         console.log e ; }  This will just result in your Error object being logged to the console. Executing a throw statement stops the execution of code in the current block, so it is important to catch errors or your application could die silently, leaving the user wondering what is happening. The error objects created have two properties, name and message. name is the name property from the constructor function, and could be Error, one of the other built-in constructors such as TypeError or ReferenceError, or a custom con- structor, which I will cover in a bit. message is just the string that was passed to the constructor, which was 'Test' in the previous example. Besides the Error object, JavaScript has six other error constructors built in, as listed in Table A-3. Table A-3. Error constructors  Constructor  EvalError  RangeError  Description Thrown when you use eval improperly. Thrown when you pass a number to a function that is outside the allowed range—for example, if you try to create an array of length -1.  ReferenceError Thrown when you try to reference a variable that does not exist.  SyntaxError  TypeError  URIError  Thrown when you pass invalid code to eval. Thrown when a variable or argument is of the wrong type—for example, if you try to access a property of an undefined variable. Thrown when you give the encodeURI or decodeURI functions invalid arguments.  92     Appendix A: JavaScript Basics  www.it-ebooks.info   It is also possible to create your own error types using the Error object:  function CustomError message  {         this.name = 'CustomError';         this.message = message; }  CustomError.prototype = new Error  ; CustomError.prototype.constructor = CustomError;  throw new CustomError 'This is a custom error' ;  That will usually result in something like "CustomError: This is a custom error" being displayed in the console, an example of which you can see in Figure A-4.  Figure A-4. Throwing a custom error Summary In this chapter, you learned the fundamentals of JavaScript:    You create strings using quotes  "string" and 'string'  and concatenate them  using the + operator.    You learned how to work with numbers—specifically, arithmetic operations using  *,  , +, and -, and the assignment operator shortcuts such as += and  =.    Functions allow you to reuse code. There are three different types:  — Anonymous function expressions: var func = function    {};. — Named function expressions: var func = function func    {};. — Function declarations: function func   {}.    You can return values using return.   You can call functions using the following syntax: greet 'World' .  Summary      93  www.it-ebooks.info     You can create objects  collections of indexed data  using the object literals  var obj = {}; , and you can access and modify properties using the dot operator. Delete object properties using the delete keyword.    Boolean data is the simplest form of data: true or false.   You can retrieve the type of a variable using typeof: typeof {} === 'object'.  Comment code using either single-line comments:    This is a single line comment or multiline comments:  * This can span multiple lines *  Arrays can be used to store nonindexed lists of information. You can create these using the array literal, var ary = ['one', 'two'], and you can access and modify items using  indexes:  ary[0]  ===  'one'.  You  can  detect  arrays  using  instanceof  and Array.isArray  , but not typeof because it returns 'object'. There are three main loops. The first, the for loop, can loop through arrays and objects like this:     Cycle through arrays for  var i = 0; i < ary.length; i++  {            ... }  for  var prop in obj  {            ... }  while  i < 27  {            ... }  do {            ... } while  i < 27 ;  The while loop is used to loop while a certain condition is true, and the do-while loop is used in a very similar way, but will always run the given code at least once:  Newer browsers support a forEach method on Array objects, which can be used like this:  ['one', 'two'].forEach function  value, index  {         console.log value ; } ;  94     Appendix A: JavaScript Basics  www.it-ebooks.info   Conditionals  e.g., myVar > 10  can be used to control the flow of the script via if, if-else, and else statements. There are many different conditionals available, such as ==, !==,  . We can use logical operators to group the conditionals together. && will return true if both conditionals are true, and  will return true if one is true. Finally, we can use the negation operator  !  to negate a value. setTimeout and setInterval allow you to put delays in your code, and run code at every specified time interval: setTimeout function    {            ... }, 1000 ;  We can define regular expressions using either the RegExp object, which accepts two arguments—new RegExp '[a-z]+', 'g' `—or the regular expression literal — [a-z]+ g`. We can use regexes with their .exec and .test methods, and there are also several string functions that accept regex arguments. We can throw errors using the throw statement: throw new Error 'This is an ex ample error' , and catch them again by using a try-catch statement. In addition to the  Error object, there are six built-in error objects—including  SyntaxError and `TypeError`—and you can also create your own custom error objects.  Summary      95  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   APPENDIX B JavaScript Resources  There are many resources, both applications and websites, that you can use to aid your JavaScript development. A Good IDE Your editor is your most useful tool when coding. I prefer IDEs  integrated develop- ment environments  to normal text editors, as they usually include additional tools such as debugging tools, file and database management, and sometimes support for version control software. You can see an example of an IDE  in this case, JetBrains PhpStorm, my IDE of preference  in Figure B-1. When I’m coding, I have only my IDE, a browser  usually Chrome , a terminal, and a music player open; my IDE in- cludes a regex toolkit that can test my regular expressions for me, a powerful debugger  although it doesn’t actually support JavaScript, hence my use of Chrome , and an HTTP inspector for when Chrome isn’t enough. Some IDEs may cost a lot—mine did—but I have found that in the majority of cases, the best ones are the more expensive ones. A free or cheap IDE may claim to have tons of features that a more expensive rival may not, but it may be difficult to use, poorly researched, and buggy. I would recommend trying more than one IDE before deciding which to use. Most of the paid ones have free trials available, so make sure to give them a try. GitHub GitHub is a huge website that hosts Git repositories. It offers free hosting to open source projects, and paid accounts are also available for people who want to hide their repositories from the public. But it isn’t just that—it also adds features to Git that make developing much easier. It allows you to view the code from the website, which can  www.it-ebooks.info  97   Figure B-1. JetBrains PhpStorm  be very useful for viewing other people’s projects, and it also allows you to view the commit history of a project. In addition, instead of commits being tagged with a name and an email address, they are tagged with the GitHub account of the committer, so you can view everything that person has contributed, what projects she has contrib- uted to, and various other statistics. GitHub also provides other functions for Git repositories, such as an issue tracker for each repository, a wiki, and a static website. It also shows some helpful graphs, such as impact  which developers have contributed what , traffic, clones, and fork infor- mation. JSHint JSHint is a syntax checker that checks your code for bad practices and warns you about them. It is based on JSLint, which is a similar tool written by Douglas Crockford. However, some people  including me  find JSLint far too strict about some things, and so JSHint was written. You can see a screenshot of JSHint in action—in this case, checking for problems in the functions from Chapter 1—in Figure B-2.  98     Appendix B: JavaScript Resources  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure  B-2.  JSHint  testing  the  addEventListener  and  removeEventListener  functions from Chapter 1 JSPerf JSPerf  is  a  great  website  for  testing  the  performance  of  JavaScript  samples  Figure B-3 shows it in action . You can enter multiple code samples, and it will test them all to see which performs the most iterations per second, and is fastest. It then saves the results and displays them in a graph compared to all the other browsers that have performed that test, making it very easy to compare the code across multiple browsers. As an example, let’s test whether it’s worth caching the result of a call to jQuery if it’s going to be called multiple times. You could add the following two test cases:     First test case $ 'foo' ; $ 'foo' ; $ 'foo' ;     Second test case var foo = $ 'foo' ; foo; foo; foo;  JSPerf      99  www.it-ebooks.info   Obviously, the second test case will be three times faster than the first test case; they contain basically exactly the same code, but the first contains it three times. But is it worth caching? Does it save only a few nanoseconds per iteration? If so, it probably isn’t worth worrying about.  Figure B-3. Test case from Chapter 3 Mozilla Developer Network The Mozilla Developer Network  MDN  contains a huge array of resources and doc- umentation for frontend developers. Searching the website, you can find articles, tu- torials, links to useful tools, and documentation on pretty much every JavaScript function, object, and method. You can find it at https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US . Pastebins A pastebin is a place to dump code to share with others. For example, if you’re stuck with a piece of code or you just want to show off how awesome something you wrote is, then you can paste it into the pastebin and it will give you a link to share with other people. Pastebins usually have built-in syntax highlighters that it will apply to your code. The most commonly used pastebin is Pastebin.com, which at the time of writing boasts over 17 million pastes. However, its syntax highlighter for JavaScript isn’t great and can be difficult to read. For this reason, I usually use another pastebin.  100     Appendix B: JavaScript Resources  www.it-ebooks.info   Gist Gist is GitHub’s pastebin. It has excellent syntax highlighting for JavaScript, and allows you to fork and clone pastes and see the difference between different revisions of pastes. It isn’t as complicated as I make it sound, and is extremely powerful. JSFiddle Something similar to a pastebin  but I wouldn’t classify it as a pastebin  is JSFiddle. It allows you to paste your HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in, and it will then run it for you. You can then save it and send the link to other people, and they can see and edit your page. This is useful for the same reason that normal pastebins are useful, except with the added functionality; as well as fixing your code, it allows people to test their edits and debug your existing code. You can see a screenshot of me editing some code from Chapter 1 in Figure B-4.  Figure B-4.

I’ll explain this in terms of Git, as it is the version control system I use on a regular basis and the only one I am familiar enough with to write about. Other version control systems include SVN and Mercurial.  Version Control Software      101  www.it-ebooks.info   When you make a change in your code, you can commit the changes. This means that for every change  usually a feature or bug fix , there is a commit. At any point you can modify the changes made in a commit or remove a previous commit, which means that you can undo changes without having to do it manually. You can also, if you break something, revert to the last commit without having to manually undo every change that you have made; this can prove extremely useful. Version control systems can also be useful for collaborating with other developers on the same piece of code. You can branch the code  i.e., create a copy of the code , do your work, commit the changes, and merge the changes back into the master branch. Multiple branches can be created, and Git is especially good at merging conflicting changes  for example, from multiple developers working simultaneously on the same file . Unless the developers have changed the same line, no manual intervention is required. Version control systems also include many other features, and can often significantly speed up development time.  102     Appendix B: JavaScript Resources  www.it-ebooks.info   About the Author Callum Macrae is a professional JavaScript developer based in the UK. He regularly contributes JavaScript-related patches to open source projects, including phpBB and jQuery++. When not coding or writing, he spends most of his time drumming or cycling. Colophon The animal on the cover of Learning from jQuery is an Asian green broadbill  Calyp‐ tomena viridis . It is distinct from the African green broadbill  Pseudocalyptomena graueri , also known as the Grauer’s broadbill. Despite Walter Rothschild christening the Grauer’s broadbill pseudocalyptomena, or “false” Calyptomena, modern science has discovered that this bird is, in fact, related to the Asian green broadbill. Thus, both this bird and its cousin are true broadbill birds. The Asian green broadbill is a small bird, averaging 15 cm in length. It has brilliant green and blue plumage, with black bars on its wings and a puff of feathers just above its beak. The broadbill is so named for its broad beak, although the beak itself is weak because this species primarily feeds on figs. The broadbill inhabits evergreen trees in Malaysian and Indonesian forests, and is still fairly common, despite increasing habitat loss. This bird makes its nest out of lichen and spider webs, which camouflages the nests to look like arboreal litter. The cover image is from Johnson’s Natural History.

If you're comfortable with jQuery but a bit shaky with JavaScript, this concise guide will help you expand your knowledge of the language - especially the code that jQuery covers up for you. Many jQuery devotees write as little code as possible, but with some JavaScript under your belt, you can prevent errors, reduce overhead, and make your application code more efficient. This book explores event handling, prototypes, and working with the DOM and AJAX through examples and lots of code. You'll learn common conventions and patterns in JavaScript and - if you've never coded with JavaScript before—a tutorial will take you through the basics.
