What readers are saying about Prototype and script.aculo.us  I use Prototype and script.aculo.us all day in my work, yet I learned a lot reading this book. I frequently dive back into it to ﬁnd information I can’t ﬁnd anywhere else. This is a helpful book written by an expe- rienced teacher that will help anybody who wants to easily add some JavaScript features to their application.  Stéphane Akkaoui Ruby on Rails developer, Feedback 2.0  If you are thinking about learning a JavaScript framework  or would like your team to... , this book is a step-by-step guide to painless Pro- totype and script.aculo.us. From the basics to advanced code, this book is written in the cleanest style. You’ll be amazed to ﬁnd out all that JavaScript can do.  Arnaud Berthomier Web developer, Weborama  This is a book that every Prototype and script.aculo.us developer should have. It’s more than a reference book; you will ﬁnd everything you need to know about these two frameworks, and you’ll learn good JavaScript practices. I have learned great tips about script.aculo.us and have discovered Prototype functions to make my code more con- cise and more readable while improving performance. Thanks for this book!  Sébastien Gruhier Founder and CTO, Xilinus  Tired of waiting around for a page to reload, again and again? Well, if you’re like me, you’re looking for a smart and elegant way to inject pieces of Ajax into your application. Well, you’ll ﬁnd in this book all you need to know about Prototype and script.aculo.us. This book will show you the best practices without forgetting the fun!  Amir Jaballah Technical Leader, Fastconnect   At Relevance, we use Prototype and Scriptaculous for all of our web projects. When we train other developers, we always get the same two questions:  1  Where can I get more information on the libraries? and  2  Where can I learn to program JavaScript in a modern, functional style?  Prototype and Scriptaculous answers both of these questions. Christophe demonstrates the power and the beauty of these libraries, and of the idiomatic JavaScript style they employ. And he doesn’t just skim the surface—his intro chapter shows more advanced Java- Script usage than some entire books on the subject. Even after years of using Prototype and Scripty, I learned new things in every chapter. Thanks Christophe!

Even though web applications such as Gmail and Google Suggest were showing the world that JavaScript  and this new thing called “Ajax”  could actually be used to improve the user experience, implementing these new techniques in your own apps proved to be painful and frustrating. Each web browser had its own quirks to work around, and most existing code wasn’t designed to take advantage of JavaScript’s object-oriented nature or powerful closure capabilities.  Inspired by the expressiveness of dynamic languages such as Ruby, we set out to build a browser programming environment that we could actually look forward to using. We started with a small set of tools that let us work with classes and functions. Then we extracted common Ajax and DOM manipulation operations from our existing applications. In March 2005, we released Prototype 1.0 as part of the Ruby on Rails framework. Prototype has grown a lot since then, but it remains focused on providing the best possible environment for JavaScript developers.  As for script.aculo.us, or “Scripty” as it’s affectionately known by the Core team, it started out as a short section of code in Prototype that implemented the now-ubiquitous “yellow fade technique.” With a desire to make web applications more user-friendly—and provide eye candy that’s really useful to boot—it quickly grew into a complete real-time DOM-based effects engine, drag-and-drop framework, and controls library. Version 1.0 was released in June 2005.  You should understand that script.aculo.us is distinct from many other UI libraries in that it does not try to shield the developer from the DOM but rather extends and improves the DOM so that developers and designers can capitalize on their existing knowledge.   PREFACE  14  Combined with Prototype, it’s engineered for building your own widgets, controls, and basically any artsy awesomeness in less time than it takes to conﬁgure heavier, widget-based frameworks.  To paraphrase the motto of Ruby, the language whose design has heav- ily inﬂuenced our libraries: Prototype and script.aculo.us are “a web programmer’s best friends.” According to the feedback we’ve received, we’re not the only ones who feel that way.  Two-and-a-half years after the initial release, Prototype and script.acu- lo.us are in use on many of the web’s most popular websites and power all sorts of innovative web applications.  This rapid popular uptake has been possible only through the efforts of the Prototype Core team, consisting of Seth Dillingham, Andrew Dupont, Mislav Marohni´c, Justin Palmer, Christophe Porteneuve, Tobie Langel, Scott Raymond, and Dan Webb; the thousands of hours of work by hundreds of contributors from the Prototype and script.aculo.us community; and, of course, Christophe, for providing this very book.  Big thanks to all of them and to you.  Sam Stephenson  Creator of Prototype  October 15, 2007  Thomas Fuchs  Creator of script.aculo.us  October 15, 2007   Chapter 1 Introduction  Prototype is a wonderful JavaScript library aimed at easing dynamic web application development. Its close friend, script.aculo.us, provides a lot of user interface–oriented features with a high wow factor  still , such as drag and drop, autocompletion, mouse-driven element sorting, awesome visual effects, and in-place editing. It’s all at your ﬁngertips, with only a couple lines of script.  The close relation between the two lies in that they both originated in the Ruby on Rails universe, as Rails “spin-offs.” They are provided with Rails but can be obtained separately on their ofﬁcial web sites and are actually backend-agnostic: you can use them over PHP, .NET, J2EE, Python, Delphi, or anything else that helps you produce dynamic web pages. And indeed, thousands of developers do just that every day. Also, script.aculo.us relies on Prototype, and both libraries are written in a consistent style.  These libraries will, quite simply, rock your world. You will discover, as I and countless others have, that client-side web page development does not need to be gruesome, kludgy, or even dull. It can be expressive, productive, efﬁcient, clean, portable, and intellectually pleasing. It can call to our technical sense of aesthetics, and most important, it can be a huge amount of fun.  1.1 It’s About Time  Prototype and script.aculo.us have been around for quite some time now. According to an Ajaxian.com survey in September 2006,1 they  1. http:  ajaxian.com archives ajaxiancom-2006-survey-results   IT’S ABOUT TIME  16  are by far the two most popular JavaScript frameworks, with whop- ping 43% and 33% adoption rates, way more than the third contender, Dojo. With the advent of Prototype’s new ofﬁcial site and comprehensive online reference documentation in January 2007, it will likely have an even higher adoption rate by the time this book hits the shelves.  Still, a year ago, both frameworks already were extremely popular. And what did shelves have to say about it? Nothing. In November 2006, Scott Raymond and Sergio Pereira produced a 30-page Prototype quick reference in O’Reilly’s Short Cuts series, but that’s it. The script.aculo.- us wiki is a good starting point but uses a fairly inconsistent style and is way out-of-date. As for Prototype, most addicts started out with Sergio’s unofﬁcial page and then had to dive into the source code to try to ﬁgure out all the neat tricks.  And some source code it is. Both frameworks squeeze all the power they can get out of JavaScript and are written in a fairly advanced style. The unfortunate result is that those diving into the code without serious JavaScript knowledge could very easily become lost, dazzled, confused, or all of these at once. Although accurate, timely, and polite answers could be found on the Google Group,2 all users agreed that some production-quality, ofﬁcial documentation was in order. It is now available, at least for Prototype, at its ofﬁcial website.3  “This is all well and good,” you might say, “but then what the heck do I need this book for?” Well, there are several reasons why reading this book is a good idea:    This book goes far beyond the documentation available online. It includes a lot more examples, goes further into details, and pro- vides a lot more besides the actual reference material: a full-on tutorial; real-world scenarios and their solutions; and plenty of extra tips, tricks, best practices, and all-around advice.    You may well want to leverage passive ofﬂine time to learn. This is about reading on the bus, in the subway, or in the passenger seat in a carpool highway lane.    Even active ofﬂine time needs a book, such as when you’re work-  ing on your laptop in a train or plane.  2. http:  groups.google.com group rubyonrails-spinoffs 3. http:  prototypejs.org   WHAT’S IN THIS BOOK, AND HOW IS IT ORGANIZED?  17    Like many people, you may just like having the physical copy of the book close at hand. It just is nicer to the eye than on-screen text, you know?  I discovered Prototype and script.aculo.us in late 2005 and dived into them for real around June 2006  since my early perusal had made me fall in love with them  when I was writing my ﬁrst book, Bien dévelop- per pour le Web 2.0, which featured rather detailed coverage of them through dedicated chapters. I loved the code I saw, I loved the code I could write, and I started contributing heavily to the Google Group and then the ofﬁcial documentation site. So if you ﬁnd examples in this book that also appear online, this is no accident. I may well have written the online page. And at any rate, when you have a very good example available, you just use it.  1.2 What’s in This Book, and How Is It Organized?  The book is organized in three parts: the case-study tutorial, the Pro- totype reference, and the script.aculo.us reference. These are not refer- ences in the usual sense of the term, which generally implies a rather dry series of object and method descriptions sprinkled with laconic snippets of code. These references are written like books unto them- selves, arranged by topics, and they devote plenty of time and effort to providing background, explaining concepts, detailing the architecture, and helping you grasp the big picture as well as the details.  Both reference parts open with an introductory chapter; these are Chapter 2, Discovering Prototype, on page 21 and Chapter 13, Discover- ing script.aculo.us, on page 253. They’re here to help you dip your foot and test the waters. Then they tackle the library by topic, in roughly prioritized order, with the most critical appearing ﬁrst. This is actually not a straight rule; for instance, in script.aculo.us, features are orthog- onal, so you can study them in any order. I decided to go ﬁrst with what seems most useful and perhaps brings the most fun.  This book is, quite simply, the comprehensive reference for these two libraries, with enough extra stuff to help you actually master them, be able to extend them for your own needs, or even contribute to them. This is the single book you need to become a Rails spin-offs guru. Doesn’t that sound good? Of course it does.   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  18  Some Things This Book Doesn’t Speciﬁcally Address Although Prototype helps and encourages best practices such as unob- trusive JavaScript, better accessibility, and so on, it does not guarantee it at all: it’s a tool, not a process.  I am personally very fond of JavaScript accessibility and the narrower subject of Ajax accessibility. I discussed them at length in my previous book, Bien développer pour le Web 2.0, which is, however, not available in English so far. . . . But the focus of this book is Prototype and script.- aculo.us, which makes it a sizeable book as it is. To stay focused and avoid straying too far aﬁeld, I won’t cover the details of such general matters, which can be tackled and honored with any set of tools, as long as your development process embraces the right constraints.  Who Is This Book For? This book is essentially for any JavaScript developer interested in fully leveraging the power of these two wonderful libraries: Prototype and script.aculo.us. I expect that you have at least a decent understand- ing of JavaScript  although you may not master its tricky details  and  X HTML, as well as basic knowledge of the DOM and CSS. That’s all you’ll need, really! Whenever we tread in deeper waters, I’ll try to help you wade through by explaining whatever details are relevant.  1.3 Acknowledgments  Writing a book is no walk in the park. It takes time, effort, dedication, steadfastness, and a tremendous amount of help and support.  I cannot thank Pragmatic Programmers enough. These guys take you through a book-writing journey that leaves you loathe to write for any- body else. As publishing goes, they’re the bleeding edge and a real mag- net for technical writers with a soft spot for efﬁciency and cool tool chains. My heartfelt thanks especially to Dave Thomas, Andy Hunt, and Daniel H. Steinberg. You’re putting the word editor into a whole new perspective and a wonderful one at that.  I would also like to express my undying gratitude to my copy editor, Kim Wimpsett, who did a wonderful job with enormous insight and attention to detail; to my indexer, Sara Lynn Eastler, who produced the outstanding, Pragmatic-Bookshelf-quality index at the end of this book; and to my typesetter, Steve Peter, who provided all the ﬁnal touches that make it all look so prim.   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  19  Before all this started, I asked Justin Palmer if I could step in his shoes and write this book for Pragmatic Programmers. Not only was he very gracious about it, but he got me on board with the Prototype documen- tation effort and later with Prototype Core. It has been an amazing ride so far. Thanks a bunch, Justin.  This book would be an order of magnitude less pleasant to read if it were not for the keen eyes and minds of its reviewers, both “live” and at the ﬁnal draft stage. I am deeply in the debt of Stéphane Akkaoui, Arnaud Berthomier, Craig Castelaz, Seth Dillingham  Prototype Core , Tom Gregory  a prominent voice on the ofﬁcial mailing list , Sébastien Gruhier  of Prototype Window Class fame , Amir Jaballah, Tobie Langel  Prototype Core , Justin Palmer  again , and Sunny Ripert. Many read- ers also got onto the bandwagon at the beta stage and went so far as to report a number of typos, errata, and the like. Among those, I’m espe- cially grateful to Steve Erbach, Brandon Kelly, and “DarkRat”  whose real name I’m sorry not to know , who’ve been particularly helpful.  Sam Stephenson  creator of Prototype  and Thomas Fuchs  creator of script.aculo.us  ﬁrst deserve the highest accolade for having churned out those two libraries. The groundbreaking nature of their work can- not be emphasized enough, and the immense satisfaction they have brought to countless web developers commands respect. When it comes to this particular book—the ﬁrst ever focusing in depth on their babies! —they not only revised the ﬁnal draft but also agreed to write the pref- ace, for which I cannot help but feel honored. Working with them is a privilege and a very fun ride, and I take this opportunity to thank them thrice over: for the libraries, for the review, and for the preface.  Élodie Jaubert, my ﬁancée, took admirably well to this second book- writing endeavor, barely four months after the previous one ended. She showed wonderful patience and support through the eight months it took to write and edit this one, bearing with quite a few late evenings and afternoons I spent writing at my desk, pushing me ahead, and giv- ing me strength and love at all turns. I could not dream of more. This book is for her.   Part I  Prototype   Furious activity is no substitute for understanding.  H. H. Williams  Chapter 2 Discovering Prototype  This part provides in-depth coverage of Prototype, which is the Java- Script library at the core of this book. Prototype is a very dense library: although rather small  at about 120KB raw, less than 30KB gzipped, it is no huge framework , it is replete with features, helper objects, and nifty tools, arranged in a reasonably consistent set.  But before we go ahead, we need to answer a few questions and tackle the more involved subjects with a clear mind and proper expectations. For example, what’s Prototype exactly? What should we expect it to do for us? What kind of lingo may we need to learn? And apparently it relies on. . . well, prototypes, so what are JavaScript prototypes in the ﬁrst place? So, I’ll start with explaining all this quickly; you will then be armed with everything necessary to fully leverage the following chapters.  2.1 What Is Prototype, and What Is It Not?  Prototype is a JavaScript library designed to improve the browser’s JavaScript environment; it extends DOM elements and built-in types with useful methods, has built-in support for class-style OOP  includ- ing inheritance , advanced support for event management, and power- ful Ajax features.  Prototype is not a complete application development framework: it does not provide widgets or a full set of standard algorithms, I O systems, or what have you. It stands in this middle ground between down-and-dirty manual coding of everything and full-ﬂedged frameworks with their countless objects. Most massive frameworks do indeed use Prototype internally and build upon it.   USING PROTOTYPE IN OUR PROJECT  22  Note, however, that there is a more visual-oriented library working closely with Prototype called script.aculo.us; we’ll explore it in the sec- ond part of this book.  Although inspired by the Ruby programming language, Prototype is not attached to any server-side technology. True, it stems from the Ruby on Rails universe, but it is a stand-alone spin-off. It is indeed very easy to use Prototype when coding with Ruby on Rails, but the library can be used with no difﬁculty over any back end, such as PHP, J2EE, or ASP.NET. It is very successfully used in production for projects with all these technologies and more.  Prototype is distributed as a single ﬁle called prototype.js, currently weighing about 120KB  before any sort of packing or gzipping . Despite this relative litheness, it provides a large set of features, most of which interoperate in an intuitive way.  2.2 Using Prototype in Our Project  So, how do we go about enabling Prototype in a web page? It is really quite simple: we just need to load prototype.js, and loading it ﬁrst will let us leverage its power in any other scripts we have. This loading is best done with a simple   element in the   of our page:        ...    ...  Where Can We Get Prototype? The ofﬁcial website is the authoritative source for the latest public ver- sion of Prototype and also provides detailed, up-to-date API documenta- tion with plenty of examples, tutorial-style articles, and a blog updated by the Prototype Core team. It’s located at http:  prototypejs.org.  2.3 What Does Our JavaScript Look Like When Using Prototype?  Good question. To make a long story short, it looks darn good. It looks nifty. It looks smart. It looks Rubyesque. JavaScript is fun again. But don’t take my word for it—see for yourself. Let’s look at a simple exam- ple and then at a more involved, combined demo that will help you understand just how easy Prototype coding is.   WHAT DOES OUR JAVASCRIPT LOOK LIKE WHEN USING PROTOTYPE?  23  A Note About Versions  This book covers Prototype 1.6. To understand how Prototype evolved, and where it’s headed, it’s worth looking at a short history.  The release of version 1.5, on January 18, 2007, was a major event for people using only the public versions. They had been stuck with 1.4 for a year, and 1.5 brought about a tremendous amount of improvements and new features.  These days, Prototype is rapidly pacing ahead, moving in swifter, shorter steps. Version 1.5.1 was released in April 2007 and brought a few new features and signiﬁcant refactor- ing and cleanup of the code base. Version 1.5.1.1, a bug- ﬁx release with a few nice surgical improvements to boot, was released in June. With a ﬁrst release candidate in early August 2007 and a ﬁnal release scheduled in October 2007, version 1.6 is a major step ahead. It introduces a complete overhaul of the event system, the ﬁrst improvements on sub- classing, and many more new features. Prototype Core is considering a later 1.6.1 release with yet more event- and class-related improvements, and then we’ll be done with the 1.x branch. The next steps will take us to 2.0. And we’re hard at work on it already!  The information in this book is current at the time we’re about to go to press. This means by the time this book is out, you’re at worst one or two months behind; in other words, you’re up-to-date on 95% of the library and have only to peruse the recent items in the change log to be on the very top of things.  You can get additional and feature updates on the book’s thebungeebook.net.  information on later  releases site and blog:   WHAT DOES OUR JAVASCRIPT LOOK LIKE WHEN USING PROTOTYPE?  24  An important note: the code in the following two examples is intention- ally heavy on Prototype “magic,” which means it might use advanced syntaxes and concepts that you may not—yet—be familiar with. Fear not, however: this was done to let you feel the might of properly lever- aging what Prototype has to offer you, and we’ll dive together, in detail, into these capabilities and syntaxes in the following chapters. If some of the code is unclear as you go through this chapter, I’m conﬁdent you’ll be able to come back and squeeze every ounce of meaning out of it once you’re through the Prototype part of the book. In the meantime, I did try to lace the text with enough explanations that you can grab the idea and general dynamics of the code.  A Simple Example: Playing with People Er, this sounds like an invitation to use pyramid scams on unsuspect- ing strangers. Actually, I just suggest we put together a simple class representing a person, then start spawning a few people with it, and ﬁnally ﬁddle with the resulting population to extract a few pieces of information. We’ll do all of it the Prototype way.  I bet you could use some code before deciding whether what I just said made any sense. So, let’s create an empty folder, put Prototype’s proto- type.js in it  version 1.5.1 or later , and write the following bench page for us to play in:  Download prototype intro basic index.html  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">         A basic demo of Prototype at work            A basic demo of Prototype at work                 The   with id="result" is just a placeholder for our upcoming script to spew HTML into.   5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  15  20  25  WHAT DOES OUR JAVASCRIPT LOOK LIKE WHEN USING PROTOTYPE?  25  Now, let’s create this basic.js we referenced and write a Person class. In Prototype, we would do it this way:  Download prototype intro basic basic.js  Line 1  var Person = Class.create {  initialize: function first, last, city, country  {  this.first = first; this.last = last; this.city = city; this.country = country;  },  },  getFullName: function   {  10  return  this.first + ' ' + this.last .strip  ;  getDisplayName: function   {  var result = this.getFullName  ; if  this.city  this.country  {  result += '  '; if  this.city  {  result += this.city; if  this.country  result += ', ';  } result +=  this.country  '' ; result += ' ';  } return result;  } } ;  This ﬁrst fragment deserves some explanation:    The Class.create    call on line 1 produces a Prototype class. For  the JavaScript gurus among you, yes, that is a function object.    When using Prototype classes, initialization is taken care of via a initialize    method, here on line 2, which receives all the arguments passed at construction time.    Finally, our getDisplayName    method, starting on line 13, builds a variable-form string representation of the person, with the ﬁrst name and or last name and possibly city country information between parentheses, all of it properly formatted and adjusted.  Being deﬁned at the prototype level, all of these methods are basically instance methods. We’ll add a class method  or static method  that pro- vides a comparator between two people.   WHAT DOES OUR JAVASCRIPT LOOK LIKE WHEN USING PROTOTYPE?  26  Just to make our code more “Prototypish” and to demonstrate neat JavaScript usage, we’ll make it conform to the following usage syntax:  Person.compare  [criterion = 'ﬁrst',] p1, p2  →  -101   Now, that’s unusual—optional arguments appearing ﬁrst! It’s actually easy to deal with once you regard your arguments as just an array of values, much like Ruby would allow. Here is the code:  Download prototype intro basic basic.js  Line 1  Person.compare = function   {  var prop = 'first', args = $A arguments ; if  args.length == 3 && typeof args[0] == 'string'   prop = args.shift  ;  var c1 = args[0][prop], c2 = args[1][prop]; return  c1 < c2 ? -1 :  c2 < c1 ? 1 : 0  ;  -  -  -  -  -  5  };  As you may know, functions in JavaScript get an automatic arguments variable that holds their arguments. It’s not an array properly speaking, but it looks like one  in other words, it features a [ ] operator and a length property , so we can readily convert it to an actual array with Prototype’s $A    utility function, as shown on line 2.  Prototype-enhanced arrays are mighty to say the least, but in this par- ticular occasion all we need is their native shift    method, which will take the ﬁrst element out and return it.  By simply checking whether there are three arguments instead of two, with a String-typed ﬁrst one, we know we’ve been called with an explicit ﬁeld name as the comparison criterion. So, we override our prop vari- able with the ﬁrst argument, which we take out of the argument list at the same time.  Now that we have the name of the ﬁeld we’re going to use for compar- ison, we need to dynamically access it for each of the two people we’re about to compare. This is trivially done in JavaScript with the square brackets operator, [ ], which we use on line 5. When used on an object, it takes an expression that evaluates to the name of a property in the object, and it returns the value of that property.  Finally, using nested ternary operators  ?: , we return -1 if the ﬁrst object looks lesser, 1 if it looks greater, and zero otherwise.   WHAT DOES OUR JAVASCRIPT LOOK LIKE WHEN USING PROTOTYPE?  27  It’s time we spawn a whole series of people to tinker with:  Download prototype intro basic basic.js  var people = [  new Person 'Jes "Canllaith"', 'Hall', 'Wellington', 'NZ' , new Person 'Sebastien', 'Gruhier', 'Carquefou', 'FR' , new Person 'Clotile', 'Michel' , new Person 'Stéphane', 'Akkaoui', 'Paris' , new Person 'Elodie', 'Jaubert', 'Paris'   ];  Notice how we do not need to pass all the arguments every time and how the objects are constructed: through the traditional new keyword.  OK, we’re all set. We can now start playing with Prototype-induced power. For instance, let’s say we need to get a sorted list of all the ﬁrst names for these people, with no risk of duplicates:  Download prototype intro basic basic.js  people.pluck 'first' .sort  .uniq  .join ', '     => 'Clotilde, Elodie, Jes "Canllaith", Sebastien, Stéphane'  Doesn’t this rock? The pluck    method fetches a given property from all the objects in the series and returns an array of the resulting values. uniq    strips out duplicates. This is rather concise, don’t you think?  How about getting full information on all people with a deﬁned country, sorted by ascending country code:  Download prototype intro basic basic.js  people.findAll function n  { return n.country; }   .sort Person.compare.bind Person, 'country'  .invoke 'getDisplayName'      => [ 'Sebastien Gruhier  Carquefou, FR ',     'Jes "Canllaith" Hall  Wellington, NZ ' ]  The ﬁndAll    method takes a predicate  a function taking an element and returning a boolean about it  and returns all the elements that passed it. Here, our predicate just returns each person’s country prop- erty, whose value may very well be undeﬁned. If it holds a nonempty string, it will be deemed true, so the predicate will pass. Otherwise, the predicate will fail.  Perhaps you come from a programming background with languages that do not have higher-order functions, meaning you can use functions as regular values to be assigned, passed around as arguments to other functions, returned as result values, and so on.   WHAT DOES OUR JAVASCRIPT LOOK LIKE WHEN USING PROTOTYPE?  28  JavaScript, like many dynamic languages, has that important feature, so we can indeed pass a function around without having to resort to “ancient” tricks such as method pointers.  In the code we just saw, we’re passing a function as an argument to the sort    method. This is one aspect of higher-order functions. The function we’re passing is actually the result of calling bind    on the original Person.compare    method, which means this bind    thing, which I’ll explain shortly in a moment, actually returns a function. This is another aspect of the language’s support for higher-order functions.  In this code, we would like to use our comparator function, except we need to pass it with the ﬁrst argument  the criterion one  preﬁlled. Pro- totype’s bind    method on functions lets us do this, among other things  and we’ll discuss it in depth in Section 4.2, Proper Function Binding, on page 58 .  Finally, the invoke    method lets us call a given method on each element in the series returned by sort     possibly with arguments, although we don’t need any here  and returns an array of the resulting values. Java- Script places no restrictions on where you can use the dot  .  operator; as long as its left side is an object, you’re in the clear. If that side is a method call, all you need is that method call to return an object; this lets you chain calls easily to any length you may need.  Finally, on page creation, once it is loaded and the DOM is all ready, we want to dynamically inject a bulleted list of all the people we have by ascending natural order  since the default value for the criterion is the ﬁrst name, we’ll get ﬁrst-name ordering .  Manually creating all the required DOM nodes would be fastidious, so we elect to build valid XHTML text and inject it safely into the proper container. Here’s the code:  Download prototype intro basic basic.js  Line 1  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  html = ' \n'  + people.sort Person.compare .map function p  {  return '\t ' + p.getDisplayName  .escapeHTML   + ' ';  $ 'result' .update html ; $$ 'result li:nth-child 2n ' .invoke 'addClassName', 'alternate' ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  } ;  } .join '\n'   + ' ';   WHAT DOES OUR JAVASCRIPT LOOK LIKE WHEN USING PROTOTYPE?  29  Look at the map    call on line 3; this is the all-purpose transformation method  pluck    and invoke    are special-purpose optimizations of it . We get an array of  ...  text with our “display” names inside, then join them with line delimiters, and ﬁnally wrap the whole thing in a  ... . To guard us against weird characters in the people data, we use escapeHTML    on the resulting strings, effectively “defanging” any markup in there.  This is all just markup. To safely inject it into the DOM, we need to grab the element with id="result", which is gracefully done with $   . This method also makes sure the element we get back is equipped with the countless DOM extensions Prototype provides, including the mighty update    method, that we use to inject our markup into the element’s DOM fragment.  Notice that our whole anonymous method is passed to document. observe   , which is part of Prototype’s uniﬁed API to event handling  if you’ve ever played with events with your bare hands, you noticed, for instance, that Internet Explorer superbly ignores most of the ofﬁcial W3C speciﬁcations about it . Our method will be run when the docu- ment’s DOM has ﬁnished loading, which is just what we need.  Finally, the killer call is on line 8. You know these fancy CSS 3 selectors we just can’t use because they’re not all that well supported yet? Well, we sure can use them with Prototype’s $$   1 to select any set of elements in the DOM! Then Prototype comes with CSS-tweaking methods, such as addClassName   , that take an extra CSS class name argument, but such methods are designed to work on the element we’re calling them on. How can we use it on all the elements $$    returned? That’s what invoke    is for, and using it lets us alter all matching elements concisely. The matching CSS is very short:  Download prototype intro basic basic.css  result li.alternate { font-weight: bold; color: green; }  Once loaded, our page looks like Figure 2.1, on the next page.  That’s it for a ﬁrst run. Excited? I hope so. Take some time to breathe. If you’re on Firefox, why not bring up a Firebug2 console and play with this script interactively? Or take a stroll.

Here we go.  One Good-Looking Script: A Table Sorter To let you feel how using Prototype can lead to neat, cool JavaScript code, we’ll build a simple table sorter. As long as our  X HTML tables properly feature a   and a  , our sorter object will be able to sort it.  The idea is to unobtrusively bind sorter objects to   elements so that the user can click the column heading and have the table sort accordingly. Clicking a second time on the current sort heading switches to a descending sort. We’ll also use a few CSS class names so that styling can be applied to express the current sorting status.  Our table sorter system is “simpler” insofar as it does not deal with data types; it treats every cell as text. On the other hand, it does grab the cell’s whole text, regardless of internal markup.  The full source code is available online. For this example, we’ll focus on the neat parts, but there’s very little we’re leaving out anyway: support for CSS rules, status toggling for the sort, and extra   elements.  Laying the Groundwork  OK, so we need an HTML page with a couple tables on it  just to show the sorting capability is neatly wrapped into an object and we can reuse it multiple times on the same page .   WHAT DOES OUR JAVASCRIPT LOOK LIKE WHEN USING PROTOTYPE?  31  We can put together such a page with tables like the following one:  Download prototype intro table_sorter index.html            What?   When?   Location               Paris Web 2007   2007-11-15   IBM La Défense   INSIA         Paris On Rails 2007   2007-12-10   Cité des Sciences    Burger Quiz party   2007-04-14   Volta                 We also need a pinch of styling to make this look presentable. A few rules are important to our purposes: the alternate class so that lines alternate background colors, the decoration that will let the user see which column is being used for sorting, and whether we use ascending or descending order. These rules are as follows:  Download prototype intro table_sorter sorter.css  thead th.sort-asc, thead th.sort-desc {  background: aaf url 'sort-asc.png'  no-repeat right center;  thead th.sort-desc { background-image: url 'sort-desc.png' ; }  }  }  tr.alternate * {  background-color: ddd;  When loaded, our page looks like Figure 2.2, on the following page.   WHAT DOES OUR JAVASCRIPT LOOK LIKE WHEN USING PROTOTYPE?  32  Figure 2.2: Our initial tables  And Now for the Scripting Part  First, we’ll create an object dedicated to handling the sorting of a given   element; we’ll call it TableSorter. In the best Prototype fashion, the idea is to make it trivial to add sorting capabilities to a   element.  We’d like to be able to do that with this simple code:  new TableSorter 'tableId'   Here’s the start of our object deﬁnition and its constructor function:  Download prototype intro table_sorter sorter.js  Line 1  var TableSorter = Class.create {  initialize: function element  {  this.element = $ element ; this.sortIndex = -1; this.sortOrder = 'asc'; this.initDOMReferences  ; this.initEventHandlers  ;  },    initialize  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -   WHAT DOES OUR JAVASCRIPT LOOK LIKE WHEN USING PROTOTYPE?  33  10  initDOMReferences: function   {  var head = this.element.down 'thead' ; var body = this.element.down 'tbody' ; if  !head  !body   throw 'Table must have a head and a body to be sortable.';  this.headers = head.down 'tr' .childElements  ; this.headers.each function e, i  {  e._colIndex = i;  } ; this.body = body;  20  },    initDOMReferences  initEventHandlers: function   {  this.handler = this.handleHeaderClick.bind this ; this.element.observe 'click', this.handler ;  25  },    initEventHandlers  15  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  Types obtained through the Class.create    system use as a constructor an initialize    method. There are a few interesting things to note in this constructor:    Notice the calls to methods such as down    and childElements   , as on line 15, and how they ease the task of walking through the DOM element hierarchy. They’re part of a treasure trove of DOM extensions guaranteed through the $    call.    Relying on $    also lets us pass in either an element ID or the  element itself  that is, its DOM reference .    The each    method on line 16 is just one example of how built-in iteration methods let us do away with manual numerical loops. It comes from the wonderful Enumerable module, which is one of the Rubyesque features offered by Prototype.    If you ever tried using a method reference as an event handler, you may have noticed you lost its binding on the way  when its code relied on the this reference, it would use the wrong object for it . Calling bind   , on line 23, spares us that frequent nightmare.  So, we have this handleHeaderClick    method that will get called on every click anywhere on our table. Its job is to make sure the click actually happened on a heading  a   element within    and, when so, to trigger sorting.   WHAT DOES OUR JAVASCRIPT LOOK LIKE WHEN USING PROTOTYPE?  34  Here it goes:  Download prototype intro table_sorter sorter.js  Line 1  handleHeaderClick: function e  {  var element = e.element  ; if  ! '_colIndex' in element   {  element = element.ancestors  .find function elt  {  return '_colIndex' in elt;  } ; if  !  element  && '_colIndex' in element    return;  } this.sort element._colIndex ;  },    handleHeaderClick  Because at construction time we endowed every proper heading cell with a custom property named _colIndex,3 checking for a valid heading is as easy as looking for that property. Note, however, how easy it is to walk the element chain from our clicked element outward until we ﬁnd such a heading cell  if indeed we clicked somewhere in one . As shown on line 4, we just need to use ﬁnd    over the ancestors    list.  This leaves us with the core sorting method, pragmatically named sort   . We’ll leave the visual adjustments to another method, named adjust- SortMarkers   , which will also do the bookkeeping on our sortIndex and sortOrder properties. This is rather plain code, with no real Prototyp- ish ﬂavor. But the sorting code, and its application to the actual DOM, gives our code a few opportunities to shine.  Download prototype intro table_sorter sorter.js  Line 1  adjustSortMarkers: function index  {  if  this.sortIndex != -1   this.headers[this.sortIndex].removeClassName 'sort-' +  this.sortOrder ;  if  this.sortIndex != index  {  this.sortOrder = 'asc'; this.sortIndex = index;  } else  this.sortOrder =  'asc' == this.sortOrder ? 'desc' : 'asc' ;  10  this.headers[index].addClassName 'sort-' + this.sortOrder ;  },    adjustSortMarkers  sort: function index  {  this.adjustSortMarkers index ; var rows = this.body.childElements  ;  3.  In scripting parlance, we call such custom additions expando properties.  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  15   WHAT DOES OUR JAVASCRIPT LOOK LIKE WHEN USING PROTOTYPE?  35  20  25  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  rows = rows.sortBy function row  {  return row.childElements  [this.sortIndex].collectTextNodes  ;  }.bind this  ; if  'desc' == this.sortOrder   rows.reverse  ;  rows.reverse  .each function row, index  {  if  index > 0   this.body.insertBefore row, rows[index - 1] ;  }.bind this  ; rows.reverse  .each function row, index  {  row[ 1 == index % 2 ? 'add' : 'remove'  + 'ClassName'] 'alternate' ;  } ;  }    sort  } ;    TableSorter  1. First, as shown on line 16, we rely on the sortBy    method, which lets us provide a custom key for the rows to sort. We’ll use that row’s proper cell and this cell’s full textual contents. To do this, we borrow the collectTextNodes    method, on line 17, that currently sits in script.aculo.us, not Prototype  this might well change soon, though . You can see the code for this method, which I pasted into the script, in the next code snippet.  2. Now that our local array holds the DOM references in the proper order, we need to mirror it in the document’s DOM. A concise way to do this, starting on line 21, is to iterate through the sorted list in reverse order, inserting elements according to it. Because the DOM method insertBefore    will remove the row from its current position prior to reinserting it, it’s just a one-call trick.  Notice how we bind the anonymous function to the current Table- Sorter object, so it can use this.body to address the property we deﬁned in the constructor  with no bind, this would be the current window object .  3. It’s now time to update the zebra striping of our rows. The order was changed, so the same rows don’t necessarily stripe the same way. It’s not sorting per se, and I should have put that in its own function, but it’s a nice example of Prototypish code, so I wanted it in this short snippet.  The call on line 26 dynamically selects between the addClass- Name    and removeClassName    methods, both being extensions provided by Prototype. It then passes the proper class name to the selected method.   WHAT DOES OUR JAVASCRIPT LOOK LIKE WHEN USING PROTOTYPE?  36  As mentioned earlier, we do need to use the collectTextNodes    method for proper sorting, and this would currently require script.aculo.us, which would be a bit overkill here. So, we can paste the correspond- ing code at the beginning of our script:  Download prototype intro table_sorter sorter.js     Borrowed from script.aculo.us' effects.js... Element.addMethods {  collectTextNodes: function element  {  return $A $ element .childNodes .collect  function node  {  return  node.nodeType==3 ? node.nodeValue :   node.hasChildNodes   ? Element.collectTextNodes node  : ''  ;  } .flatten  .join '' ;  } } ;  -  -  } ;  There! We have this nice little object available, so how do we dynami- cally apply it to all   elements in the document? With very few lines and the wonderful $$    selector, this is how:  Download prototype intro table_sorter sorter.js  Line 1  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  $$ 'table' .each function table  { new TableSorter table ; } ;  When the DOM is done loading, our anonymous function gets called, and its single line  line 2  uses the ubiquitous $$    function to select all tables in the document and then creates a TableSorter object over each. We’ll dive more into the astounding powers of $$    in Section 3.4, $$ Searches with Style, on page 45.  OK, now let’s refresh our page and try it. After a few clicks on headings, you could obtain something like Figure 2.3, on the following page.  And that’s it for our second, fuller example. All in all, our TableSorter object is about 70 lines of code, which is admittedly low for such a fea- ture set. If you need advanced capabilities, such as support for data types, merged rows and columns, and more, check out the Table Sort- ing with Prototype library by Andrew Tetlaw,4 a Prototype fan from Down Under. It’s likely to have all the features you need and more.  4. http:  tetlaw.id.au view blog table-sorting-with-prototype    PROTOTYPE JARGON AND CONCEPTS  37  Figure 2.3: Sorted tables after a few clicks  2.4 Prototype Jargon and Concepts  Prototype comes with a handful of speciﬁc notions that will come up time and again in this reference. To keep things nice and concise, I will provide names for these notions. As with any domain, knowing the lingo will help you grasp things more readily and avoid potential mistakes.  Objects, Namespaces, and Modules Prototype objects fall into three categories, which I’ll use when describ- ing an object. This categorization lets you immediately understand how a given object is to be used. There are three categories: class, name- space, and module.  Class  Such objects are intended for regular use: construction with the new operator, properties being stored in instance ﬁelds, and so on. Regular objects include ObjectRange, Ajax.Request, and Peri- odicalExecuter, for instance.   PROTOTYPE JARGON AND CONCEPTS  38  Namespace  Module  Several objects are not intended for instantiation. They exist only to bundle related elements, such as functions or objects. I call such objects namespaces, because this is the role they play—a named area where related objects exist. Two examples of such namespaces are Ajax and Event.  Sometimes an object is neither a regular namespace nor a proper namespace. It does contain methods, but these are supposed to be mixed in another object’s prototype. There is generally some assumption about this other object; it is usually supposed to fea- ture one or more methods, upon which the mixed-in ones depend.  Such objects represent an almost stand-alone feature set that just needs a host object to satisfy a few criteria in order to extend it with all those features. I call such objects modules, because it is the exact term for this kind of entity in the Ruby world, and the word sounds nice. Prototype’s most famous module is Enumerable, which is mixed in by numerous objects, such as Array.  Iterators For brevity’s sake, I use iterators for all callback functions that are passed to methods that, internally, iterate over a collection. Such call- back functions are called in sequence over part or all of the iterated ele- ments. The quintessential iteration function is Enumerable.each, which most functions from Enumerable rely upon internally.  Extended Elements Prototype features an awesome DOM extension mechanism, described at great length in Chapter 7, Playing with the DOM Is Finally Fun!, on page 130. When I refer to extended elements  which happens fairly often , I mean a DOM element that went through DOM extension, one way or another. This essentially means all element-related methods can be invoked straight on it, which is good. elt.hide   feels much more object-oriented than Element.hide elt , don’t you think?  Aliases Sometimes, a given feature is well-known under multiple names. For instance, consider a method that iterates through a sequence to ﬁnd   WHAT ARE PROTOTYPES ANYWAY?  39  the ﬁrst occurrence that matches a criterion. Depending on the tech- nical environment you’re used to, you may think of it as detect    or ﬁnd   .  Prototype provides many such methods, which are commonly referred to by at least two names. When that happens, Prototype uses a form of aliasing. I then refer to these methods as aliases; if one name clearly dominates or is deemed preferable for one reason or another, I may label its other name only as being an alias.  2.5 What Are Prototypes Anyway?  Most people are used to regular object-oriented programming where types are deﬁned by classes, which are usually closed  you cannot change them dynamically , and where they serve as blueprints for all instances of the class. Classes can organize themselves in a hierarchy, where every child class inherits all the attributes of its ancestor classes.  JavaScript works in an entirely different way. Everything is an object, and every object is deﬁned by a constructor function and this construc- tor’s prototype. A prototype is basically a repository of things  mostly methods  that all objects produced by the constructor function share.  This all sounds a bit quirky, so let’s look at some simple example code:  Download prototype intro prototypes.js  Line 1  function Person lastName, firstName  {  this.lastName = lastName; this.firstName = firstName;  }  Person.prototype = {  getFullName: function   {  return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;  var sam = new Person 'Stephenson', 'Sam' ; var thomas = new Person 'Fuchs', 'Thomas' ;  sam.getFullName      -> 'Sam Stephenson' thomas.getFullName      -> 'Thomas Fuchs'  }  10  }  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  15  On line 1, you can see a classic constructor function, which is simply a function that is intended to be used with the new operator and that   WHAT ARE PROTOTYPES ANYWAY?  40  manipulates the this reference to work with instance members  such as instance ﬁelds . You can see a call to the constructor on line 12.  Starting on line 6, we deﬁne what is in our constructor’s prototype. Here, it’s only a single method, called getFullName   , which uses a sim- ple version of the full-name algorithm. The important point here is that this method’s deﬁnition is shared by all instances of the Person class. It is deﬁned only once and used from then on. We use it indifferently on both instances, as you can see from line 15.  This is very much preferable to “old-school” code that you still ﬁnd in too many tutorials, which goes something like this:  Download prototype intro bad_function_deﬁnition.js  function Person lastName, firstName  {  this.lastName = lastName; this.firstName = firstName; this.getFullName = function   {    DON'T DO THIS!  return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;  }  }  In such code, every single time an instance is created, it gets its own singleton method  a method that exists speciﬁcally on this object; its deﬁnition is not shared by any other instance . This is entirely wasteful, because the function’s deﬁnition does not change over time and does not need lexical closure from the constructor’s code, since it uses data obtained only from the this reference. The prototype-based approach is a much cleaner solution  and is how JavaScript is supposed to be used anyway .  Note that the syntax we use to express the prototype from line 6 onward is pure-vanilla JavaScript. The {...} block is a regular object literal, with a comma-delimited list of key: value pairs.  Now for the salient points. First, prototypes are open. You can alter them at any point, and this retroactively alters all the instances based on this prototype. So, for instance, adding a method to String.prototype makes it available to all String objects, whether they were created prior to or after the addition! This is a way of “monkey patching”5 classes, much like you would do on Ruby classes and modules.  In scripting parlance, monkey patching is the practice of patching existing objects 5.  classes, functions, and so on  at run time, not in their actual source code. Dynamic languages, which generally leave their types “open,” are a prime candidate for this kind of approach.   RUNNING PROTOTYPE CODE SAMPLES IN THIS BOOK  41  Second, there is no inheritance per se. You cannot make a prototype inherit from another, at least not in the regular sense. But the syntaxes provided by Prototype let you emulate “classical” inheritance for just about all intents and purposes.  If you need to get further details on how Prototype uses constructor functions and prototype manipulation to implement classes and mod- ules, look at Appendix A, on page 391. It explains all this and outlines all you need to know in order to extend Prototype for your own needs or even contribute to the framework itself.  2.6 Running Prototype Code Samples in This Book  Most of the functions, methods, and objects in this part of the book are documented through small code snippets. The ﬁles are available online, but in order to execute them, you’ll often need to run the code in the context of a web page with Prototype loaded. The easiest way to try them is to set up a small web page, load it in your browser, and then copy paste the snippets in your JavaScript console or, better yet, your Firebug console  if you’re using Firebug on Firefox, which you should be, indeed . The page itself can be minimal to the point of Zenhood:  Download prototype bench.html  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">        My Prototype test bench                 A simple page to test Prototype   Of course, you’d need to put Prototype’s library ﬁle in the same direc- tory for things to work smoothly. A few snippets here and there assume your page contains this or that element  for example, “a simple   element with an id= attribute set to navbar” . Just add whatever is nec- essary to your test page. In the long run, it will look something like Prototype’s unit test pages  that is, it will feature a haphazard assort- ment of utterly unrelated elements that seem, at ﬁrst glance, to have been thrown in there with no rhyme or reason . That’s OK. It’s a test bench! It should smell of sawdust, fresh paint, and hot iron.   Good things, when short, are twice as good.  Baltasar Gracián  Chapter 3 Quick Help with the Dollars  3.1 Shortcuts Should Be Short  There are little bits of code that you use all the time. For example, how often do you type document.getElementById? There are many such examples, and Prototype provides convenient shortcuts for the most common ones.  But shortcuts should live up to their name; they should actually be short. They should also be instantly recognizable as shortcuts. This is why Prototype uses the “dollar convention” to name shortcuts by using two characters: the dollar sign and an extra letter or sign.  Such shortcuts are referred to as utility functions in Prototype, and they are, indeed, very useful. This chapter will take you through them all, which will be quick enough but immeasurably useful; you’ll be able to express in a very few characters of code what used to be boringly ver- bose or even dauntingly complex: ID- or even CSS-based DOM extrac- tions, ﬂexible array conversions, and more!  3.2 Quick Fetching of Smart Elements with $  The $    function is by far the most useful  and indeed, the most used  function in Prototype. Its goal is twofold:    It lets you fetch a DOM element by its ID in the most concise syntax possible. Because of this, for example, if  $ ’foo’   is the preferred way of quickly verifying that an element exists. . . .   QUICK FETCHING OF SMAR T ELEMENTS WITH $  43    It provides a guaranteed way of getting an extended element. Re- member those? As discussed in Section 2.4, Extended Elements, on page 38, an extended element is a DOM element object that became endowed with all the additional methods provided by Prototype’s DOM extension mechanism. It’s a DOM element with superpowers, so to speak.  Having the guarantee that the resulting element is extended makes $    not only much more concise than its traditional pure-DOM counterpart  document.getElementById  but also superior from a usage standpoint. Since the resulting elements feature all the extended methods, you can make your code both shorter and more object-oriented. In short, you can make it more expressive:  Download prototype utility dollar.js     Vanilla DOM document.getElementById 'navBar' .style.display = 'none';     Prototype's way - because of DOM extension! $ 'navBar' .hide  ;     And if $ did not guarantee extended elements... Element.hide 'navBar' ;  Another key point is that you can pass $    either an ID string  such as ’navbar’  or an actual DOM element reference. Either way, you’ll get the extended version of the element  if this element was already extended, it is basically untouched . This behavior is used by every single method in Prototype that takes “an element” as an argument, always allowing you to pass either the element’s ID or its actual reference.  A ﬁnal feature is that you can grab many elements at once by pass- ing multiple arguments  each of which has the same ﬂexibility we just described , in which case you’ll get an array of extended elements back. This can be very useful:  Download prototype utility dollar-multiple.js     "I haven't read the whole doc on $  " var items = []; items[0] = $ 'navbar' ; items[1] = $ 'adbar' ; items[2] = $ 'footer' ;     "I sure did!" var items = $ 'navbar', 'adbar', 'footer' ;   $W, BECAUSE ARRAY LITERALS ARE BORING  44  To summarize, the following syntaxes are supported:  $ ID  → extendedElement $ element  → extendedElement $ IDelement...  → [ extendedElement, ... ]  In syntax blocks such as the previous summary, the   referred to as the pipe character  describes an alternative, which remains local when applied to an argument. In the third syntax, you should not read, as you would on a regular expression, “an ID, or an element and an ID, or a series of elements.” Instead, you should read “an ID or an element, followed by one or more arguments that each can also be an ID or an element, individually.” As for the square brackets and dots on the return type, this reads “an array of extended elements,” which does not imply anything about the size of returned arrays; they might contain any number of items, including 0 or 1.  Hey, who doesn’t like having dollars around anyway?  3.3 $w, Because Array Literals Are Boring  Sometimes, typing string array literals can seem like a study in rigor; getting all the quotes and commas right seems like a burden to some, especially if there are numerous elements. Perl developers have long used the qw    function, and Rubyists are fond of %w. Prototype gives you $w   , which is slightly different from both these venerable prece- dents in that it requires you to pass it an actual string, which will be split based on whitespace:  Download prototype utility dollar-w.js     The hard way var fruits = ['raspberries', 'pears', 'peaches', 'kiwis'];     The easy way var fruits = $w 'raspberries pears peaches kiwis' ;  Because it splits on whitespace, you cannot, obviously, use it when you have individual elements that contain whitespace. Also, if the passed string is nothing but whitespace  or is plain empty , you’ll get an empty array back.   3.4 $$ Searches with Style  $$ SEARCHES WITH STYLE  45  This one is quite the power tool. It lets you harvest your DOM and get elements based on CSS selectors—not just CSS class names, either. You can use advanced selectors, because $$    features almost the whole complement speciﬁed by CSS 3. Here are a few examples:  Download prototype utility dollar-dollar.js  $$ 'div'     -> all DIVs in the document.           document.getElementsByTagName 'div' , although returning a non-live Array of extended  as in $'d  elements, instead of a live NodeList of  possibly unextended  elements.  Similar to  $$ 'contents'     -> same as $ 'contents' , only it returns an array anyway.  $$ 'li.faux'     -> all LI elements with class 'faux'  $$ 'contents a[rel]'     -> all links inside the element of ID "contents" with a rel attribute  $$ 'a[href=""]'     -> all links with a href attribute of value ""  eyeew!   $$ 'navbar li', 'sidebar li'     -> all list items within the elements of ID "navbar" or "sidebar"  $$ 'a:not [rel~=nofollow] ' ;    -> all links, excluding those whose rel attribute contains the word     "nofollow"  $$ 'table tbody > tr:nth-child even ' ;    -> all even rows within all table bodies  $$ 'div:empty' ;    -> all DIVs without content  i.e., whitespace-only   Supported CSS Selectors To avoid browser compatibility hassles, Prototype has its own CSS parser code, which means it may well differ from the regular CSS selec- tor set your browser originally provides. Version 1.6 supports the fol- lowing selectors:  Type  Tag names, as in div.   $$ SEARCHES WITH STYLE  46  Descendant  Attribute  Whitespace between other selectors, as in a li.  The full CSS 3 set is available:  [attr] Is present.  [attr=value] Has a speciﬁc value.  [attr~=value] Has a whitespace-separated list containing a value.  Think class= values.  [attr=value] Has a speciﬁc value or starts with it followed by a  hyphen  - . Think language codes.  [attr!=value] Does not have a speciﬁc value  note it’s not standard  CSS 3; it’s just there for convenience .  [attr∧=value] Starts with a speciﬁc value.  [attr$=value] Ends with a speciﬁc value.  [attr*=value] Contains, anywhere, a speciﬁc value.  If the value you’re matching against includes a space, be sure to enclose the value in quotes, as in [title="Hello world!"].  CSS class names, as in .highlighted or .example.wrong.  As in item1 > a.  As in item1 + p.  As in item1 ~ p.  Class  Child  Sibling  Adjacent  :not . . .    :nth-*  :ﬁrst-*  As in *:not .critical  or a:not [rel~=nofollow] .  As in tbody > tr:nth-child even , dialog > p:nth-child 3n+1 , or intro > p:nth-of-type 2 .  As in intro > h1:ﬁrst-of-type or footer > *:ﬁrst-child.   $A, THE COLLECTION UNIFIER  47  :last-*  :empty  As in ul > li:last-child or article p:last-of-type.  As in p:empty.  :enabled, :disabled, and :checked  As in input:enabled or input:checked.  Naturally, you can combine these selectors and use multiple combina- tions as well, as shown in the previous large code example. This can actually get pretty complex, with stuff like this:  $$ 'items td.controls > input[type!="submit"]:not :disabled '   However, try to optimize your markup so your CSS-based selections are as simple as can be. When you ﬁnd yourself reaching for every ounce of syntax power in there, you’re probably using something too complex for your actual needs. . . .  For further details on the exact semantics of these selectors, look up the W3C Recommendation for CSS 3 Selectors.1 Oh, and in case you were wondering, the elements are, naturally enough, returned in document order  and with no duplicates .  3.5 $A, the Collection Uniﬁer  This function is a kind of universal converter that turns just about anything roughly collection-like  or, if you prefer, “array-compatible”  into an actual Array object.  When would you need to do that? Well, the occasions are plenty. When scripting a web page, you often ﬁnd yourself getting some collection back from the DOM, usually an implementation of NodeList or HTMLCol- lection. Or perhaps you’re dynamically exploring the arguments passed to your function, through JavaScript’s predeﬁned arguments variable. All of these are not actual arrays  as in, they are not instances of Array , but they “look like one.” They feature an integer length property, and they have integer-indexed properties ranging between 0 and length - 1, accessible through the [ ] operator. You could say such objects are iterable.  1. http:  www.w3.org TR css3-selectors    $A, THE COLLECTION UNIFIER  48  OK, so we have several common cases when what we manipulate are not actual arrays but are iterable. What’s the big deal? Well, you see, Prototype extends Array. A lot. You can get all the juicy details in Sec- tion 4.6, Arrays, on page 76, after which it should be abundantly clear to you just how badly Array trumps any other collection type in town.  To get the feel of it, just look at the following before after examples:  Download prototype utility dollar-a.js     Using the regular types var paras = document.getElementsByTagName 'p' ; for  var index = 0; index < paras.length; ++index   Element.hide paras.item index  ;  Element.update paras.item paras.length - 1 , 'Jeez that is verbose' ;     The Prototype way  nonextending version, though  var paras = $A document.getElementsByTagName 'p'  ; paras.each Element.hide ; Element.update paras.last  , 'This looks better' ;  Note that if we didn’t mind extending fetched elements as we went, we could actually change the two lines fetching our paragraphs to hide them so they become this:  var paras = $$ 'p' ; paras.invoke 'hide' ;  But hey, we were working on $A   , right? Here’s another example with JavaScript’s automatic arguments local variable in functions:  Download prototype utility dollar-a-2.js     Using the regular types function showArgs   {  alert Array.prototype.join.call arguments, ', '  ;  }  }     The Prototype way function showArgs   {  alert $A arguments .join ', '  ;  So, how does $A    go about converting stuff to an actual Array? It’s quite simple really:  1. null, undeﬁned, and false become an empty array.  2. If the object features a toArray    method, we delegate to it.  3. Otherwise, we assume the object is “iterable.” We then iterate over  it in the usual way to build our actual array.   $F IS A FIELD EXPER T  49  The nifty thing about this reliance on toArray    is that all objects that mix in the Enumerable module have one, which makes for cool tricks. In the following code, we’ll use the $R    function, which we’ll discuss shortly in Section 3.8, Handling Ranges with $R, on the next page, that represents a range of values and constitutes a valid Enumerable. This lets you see a concrete conversion:  Download prototype utility dollar-a-tricks.js  $A $R 1, 10      -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]     OK, playing with the cool kids now...  var names = ['Amir', 'Arnaud', 'Stéphane', 'Sunny', 'Tobie']; $A $R 1, names.length  .zip names, function a  { return a.join '. ' ; }     -> ['1. Amir', '2. Arnaud', '3. Stéphane', '4. Sunny', '5. Tobie']  “A” as in “Amazing!”  3.6 $F Is a Field Expert  $F fieldElt  → value  [ value, ... ]  $F    takes a form ﬁeld  or its ID  and returns the ﬁeld’s value. Careful: it takes the ID, not the name  the value of the name= attribute .  Getting the value from a form ﬁeld sounds like an easy task, but it isn’t so simple actually. If you’re dealing with a textual ﬁeld  such as a   with type="text" or a   , you’re pretty much in the clear. But radio buttons and checkboxes should yield a value only when they’re checked, and listboxes rely on a list of options, where multiple options might be selected. Even when properly detecting the selected ones, the relevant   tags may not have a deﬁned value= attribute, in which case you should use the text within the opening and closing tags.  As you can see, the complexity of the algorithm to guarantee you get the proper value quickly escalates. There are a few discrepancies, too, between browsers  for instance, Internet Explorer doesn’t observe this latest rule for listbox options with no value= attribute .  To spare you the trouble of dealing with values in multiple ways or of having to work around these inconsistencies, $F    handles it all and returns the properly extracted value:   $H MAKES A HASH OF THINGS  50    For multiple-selection listboxes, you’ll get an array of values, one for each selected option. For anything else, you’ll get a single value.    For unchecked radio buttons or checkboxes, you’ll get null.    For anything else, you’ll get a single value.  All actual values are returned as strings, and for listbox options, if the value= attribute is missing, you get the option’s text.  3.7 $H Makes a Hash of Things  Prototype provides a new kind of object, called hashes, through the Hash type. We will explore it in Section 10.1, Storing Values in a Hash, on page 225. Once you start working with hashes, it can get pretty addictive, so you might ﬁnd yourself quite often writing new Hash ... . The $H    function is a convenience shortcut for this.  3.8 Handling Ranges with $R  This is probably a slightly underused function, simply because the object it relies on  see Section 10.2, Expressing Ranges of. . . Well, Any- thing You Want!, on page 230  is itself underused. This is simply a convenience alias over the ObjectRange constructor. No fancy ﬂuff, no extra features or safeguard. A plain alias. Its most common use is, of course, for integer ranges:  Download prototype utility dollar-r.js  $R 1,5 .each function n  {     Gets invoked 5 times, with n from 1 to 5  } ;  $A $R 1, 7      -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  $R 1, 10 .findAll function n  {  return 0 != n % 2;  }     -> [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]  Ranges can be very useful things in the appropriate context. You’ll learn more about them in their dedicated sections.  And that’s it! Those are Prototype’s utility functions. You’ll ﬁnd yourself using them over and over again. They’re pretty much ubiquitous, both   HANDLING RANGES WITH $R  51  in the library’s source code and in real-world user code. And although $    and $A    are by far the most popular ones, do not pass over the other ones; they’re all here for a reason, and they’re all idiomatic Prototype.  Let’s Review What We Learned  Prototype offers a series of utility functions, which are so commonly used that their names were made as short as reasonably possible: just two characters  a dollar sign and a letter .    $    is all over the place, grabbing DOM elements by their id= and extending them on the ﬂy if need be. It is the key to tapping the power of Prototype’s countless DOM extensions and does away with the oh-so-verbose document.getElementById.    $A    turns just about anything remotely array-compatible into a bona ﬁde Array, complete with its scores of extended methods  which we’ll detail in the next chapter . As a special shortcut to creating an array of no-space strings, $w    splits a single string into an array of “words.”    $$    lets us extract parts of our DOM using all the might of CSS 3  selectors, regardless of our browser’s actual CSS support.  Those are the core ones. Prototype also provides more targeted func- tions:    $F    extracts the current value, however complex, of a form ﬁeld.  Remember that it uses the ﬁeld’s id=, not its name=.    $H    is the short way of creating hashes, which are slightly en-  hanced associative arrays.    Finally, $R    creates ranges, which come in handy to iterate over  sequences of values, be they integers, characters, and so on.   Chapter 4 Regular JavaScript on Steroids  Prototype goes to great lengths to make JavaScript development feel better. Prototype Core loves Ruby.  Who doesn’t? Honestly, give it a seri- ous try.  That’s why Prototype tries to make JavaScript feel more like Ruby—so that most common tasks become a breeze and are eminently readable. Dealing with collections of items  be it for simple iteration, ﬁltering, transforming, or whatnot , exploring object properties, manip- ulating strings, or even ﬁnally passing methods around without losing their binding along the way—all of this  and much more!  becomes easy as pie when using Prototype.  4.1 Generic Object Manipulation  In JavaScript, just about everything is an object: strings, numbers, functions, arrays, regular expressions. . . . And there is a basic inheri- tance that makes all objects descend from the fundamental Object type. Prototype carefully avoids adding anything in Object.prototype, because this would percolate into every single object, effectively breaking every legitimate use of the for...in construct. However, Prototype does add a few methods in the Object namespace that are mainly geared toward object introspection.  A Fresh Look at for...in Misconception alert: for...in is not intended to iterate over an array. That it works  and works only as long as you leave Array’s prototype untouched  is a mere side effect. Its actual purpose is fairly different. It is intended to iterate over all the iterable properties and methods of an object.   GENERIC OBJECT MANIPULATION  53  Native methods  and many native properties  usually do not appear in a for...in loop because JavaScript does not mark them as iterable. In an array, for example, only the numerical indices of its cells are iterable, which creates the illusion that you can use for...in to iterate over its contents. Unfortunately, our own code cannot mark properties or methods as “not iterable.” Everything we augment native types with will show up on such a loop. Because Prototype relies a lot on extending native types with custom methods, using for...in when it’s not exactly appropriate starts yielding weird values.  Download prototype steroids for_in.js  var arr = ['hello', 'world']; var props = []; for  var prop in arr   props.push prop ;     Without extensions to Array.prototype:    -> ['0', '1']     With Prototype's extensions:    -> ['0', '1', 'each', 'eachSlice', 'all', ..., 'clone']  38 items   Before throwing a vase at Sam Stephenson, remember that just about every common use case for iteration is covered in a very concise way by the methods Array gains, either directly or through mixing in the Enumerable module. Just look at Section 4.6, Arrays, on page 76.  In short, you just need to remember this: for...in is not actually intended for array iteration. It iterates over all the properties of an object, including its methods.  If you’re looking for a pure-JavaScript, efﬁcient array iteration, there’s only one true way:  for  var index = 0, l = array.length; index < l; ++index      your code using index here  This is usually regarded as optimum code; it uses local variables, caches array length  which is useful when, for some reason, the Java- Script runtime doesn’t , and uses the preﬁx ++ operator to avoid the potential cost of uselessly saving the index’s pre-incrementation value. You can’t go much faster than that, I guess. Yes, it’s a bit more verbose than the tricks wrapped around it by libraries. But it’s fast, and it’s correct. It won’t get foiled by extensions to Array.prototype, because it’s doing exactly what you need. It iterates on the array’s integer-indexed properties, not all its properties.   GENERIC OBJECT MANIPULATION  54  Introspecting Objects Object.inspect obj  → String Object.isArray obj  → Boolean Object.isElement obj  → Boolean Object.isFunction obj  → Boolean Object.isHash obj  → Boolean Object.isNumber obj  → Boolean Object.isString obj  → Boolean Object.isUndefined obj  → Boolean Object.keys obj  → [ String, ... ] Object.values obj  → [ value, ... ] Object.toQueryString obj  → String  The keys    and values    methods let you treat any object like a basic hash  or associative array, if you will . They provide an array of prop- erty names or of these properties’ values, respectively. The actual order of the array is not guaranteed, because this implementation relies on for...in internally, for which the JavaScript speciﬁcation does not man- date any particular order. Still, because of this dependence, you will get all the extensions Prototype provides to the object, as in the second case in the previous code sample.  Version 1.6 introduces a series of type detection methods all starting with is. Most of them rely on the typeof operator  isFunction   , isNum- ber   , isString   , and isUndeﬁned    . One is a convenience shortcut over an instanceof call  isHash    . Finally, two are a bit more advanced: isArray    checks the object’s constructor against Array, and isElement    veriﬁes the object’s nodeType property value  expecting 1, which is the ELEMENT type . These methods are used extensively in Prototype to help make the code more expressive  that is, more concise and yet more readable at the same time ; be sure to use them in your own code to reap the same beneﬁt!  The inspect    method enjoys a loftier status, because it has a wider impact on the Prototype library. The idea for this method is to provide the developer with better string representations of objects, mostly for debugging purposes. The reason behind this is that the default string representations JavaScript provides are not very useful in quite a few cases.  For instance, take null or undeﬁned; in many cases, they will amount to the empty string  such as when passed as arguments or when being items in arrays , which certainly will not give the developer enough clues. Arrays will be rendered without their square-bracket delimiters. Strings also appear without delimiters. This can cause confusion when   GENERIC OBJECT MANIPULATION  55  Figure 4.1: toString    makes for unhelpful displays.  you want to display something that contains, say, carriage returns or newline characters, or even just spaces. DOM objects usually get ren- dered as their interface name  for example, HTMLFormElement . Consider the following code:  Download prototype steroids toString.js     Assuming a   with ID 'navbar' and a 'nonPrint' CSS class... var data = ["hello\nworld!", false, null, , " ", 42, $ 'navBar' , "\n"]; alert data ;  On Firefox 2, for instance, this will display as in Figure 4.1.  That’s not very helpful, is it? What Object.inspect    does is this:  1. It renders null and undeﬁned properly  using their names .  2. If the object passed as an argument features an inspect    method,  it delegates to it.  objects have .  3. Otherwise, it reverts to the bare-bones toString    method  which all  The thing is, Prototype provides nice inspect    methods for several types, both native and custom, namely, String, Array, Enumerable, and Hash. It is also added to extended DOM elements, letting you obtain a reg- ular XML tag representation with its id and class attributes, if any. Because the inspect    implementations for containers recursively call Object.inspect    on their items, you get as good a representation as pos- sible.  Converting the previous code to inspect    results in the following listing:  Download prototype steroids inspect.js     Assuming a   with ID 'navbar' and a 'nonPrint' CSS class... var data = ["hello\nworld!", false, null, , " ", 42, $ 'navBar' , "\n"]; alert Object.inspect data  ;   GENERIC OBJECT MANIPULATION  56  Figure 4.2: The wonders of Object.inspect     This produces a much more usable display, as you can see in Fig- ure 4.2.  I ﬁnd such output much more helpful from a debugging standpoint. Of course, you do not have to use such a kludge as the good ol’ alert   . Depending on your installed browser or extensions, you may have nicer mechanisms at hand. I, for one, am a big fan of the Firebug1 extension to Firefox and tend to use its console.log    method  and other debug- oriented methods in the same object  for such purposes.  Finally, version 1.6.0 added the toQueryString    method for use cases when you have any regular object and want to serialize it in the URL- encoded way. This used to be a static method of the Hash class but didn’t quite make sense there. It’s actually based on its instance-level namesake in Hash, though.  Cloning and Extending Objects Object.clone obj  → newObject Object.extend dest, source  → dest  Prototype devotes two methods to the  somewhat technical  task of cloning objects. By cloning, I mean “producing an object with a shal- low copy of the original object’s property set.” In short, we start with an empty object and iterate over all the properties in the original one, copying them to the new one. This is shallow copying, which means the properties do not get cloned. We just share references. This is no issue for simple values, such as strings and numbers, but can be surprising when properties are themselves custom objects, arrays, and the like.  1. http:  getﬁrebug.com   GENERIC OBJECT MANIPULATION  57  Let me illustrate:  Download prototype steroids clone.js  var o = {  name: 'Prototype', version: 1.5, authors: ['sam', 'contributors']  }; var o2 = Object.clone o ;    Apparently cloning...  o2.version = '1.5 weird'; o2.authors.pop  ;    Watch out!  Shared reference inside!  o.version    -> 1.5  o2.version    -> '1.5 weird'  o.authors    -> ['sam']    Ouch!  Shallow copy ended up with a shared array!  Therefore, tread carefully with clone   . Also note that several custom objects in Prototype provide their own clone    method, as does Array, but this is usually for performance or consistency purposes and does not involve deep copy.  The last method Prototype puts in the Object namespace is extend   , which is at the heart of how Prototype extends built-in objects. We will explore its usage in more depth in Appendix A, on page 391, but for now, know this: Object.extend    basically simulates a sort of static inheritance through a one-time copy of all properties  including meth- ods, remember?  from the source  or parent  object to the destination  or child  object.  This is used extensively inside Prototype itself to mix in modules, extend namespaces, and so forth. Actually, Object.clone    is easily deﬁned thanks to Object.extend   :  Download prototype steroids extend.js  clone: function object  {  return Object.extend {}, object ;  ...  } ...  An important note: do not mistake this method with Element.extend   , which is much more intricate and is at the heart of Prototype’s DOM   PROPER FUNCTION BINDING  58  extension machinery. We will explore this one in Chapter 7, Playing with the DOM Is Finally Fun!, on page 130, but just remember this for now: Object.extend    simply takes two objects and grafts the second one’s properties onto the ﬁrst one. On the other hand, Element.extend    takes a DOM element  not just any object  that it augments, if necessary, with all the extensions Prototype provides depending on its actual type  or tag name, if you prefer .  Miscellanea Object.toHTML obj  → String RegExp.escape touchyText  → String  The Object.toHTML    method will use the parameter’s toHTML    method if it exists; otherwise, it will rely on String’s interpret     which produces an empty string for null or undeﬁned and relies on native String conver- sion otherwise . It is mostly used internally for content insertion and replacement in the DOM extensions, but I mention it here for the sake of completeness.  As another utility function, RegExp.escape    lets you “defang” text that you want to use inside a regular expression, with no risk of its contents altering the expression semantics. Every character in the text that has meaning in a regex context will be escaped, so you can safely include it. For instance, RegExp.escape ’Hi. [1] Anyone there?’  yields ’Hi\. \[1\] Anyone there\?’.  4.2 Proper Function Binding  JavaScript has this particular notion called function binding. The bind- ing of a function is, essentially, the object to which its this reference is bound when the function executes. It is a dynamic concept; it is not statically resolved when the function is deﬁned. It all depends on the actual execution ﬂow of your code—which chain of function calls and which objects these functions were called on  be it through the obj.method   notation or through more advanced JavaScript tricks, such as the apply    or call    methods , leading to your function eventu- ally being called.  By default, a function deﬁned outside any explicit object is bound to the current window object, accessible through the predeﬁned window variable.   PROPER FUNCTION BINDING  59  You can see this with the following code:  Download prototype steroids binding-window.js  function getName   {  return this.name  }  getName      -> ''  window.name = 'Demo'; getName      -> 'Demo'  Functions deﬁned in a speciﬁc object  which I will refer to as methods from now on  have, quite unsurprisingly, a default binding on their con- tainer object. It just so happens that JavaScript lets you drop the win- dow object reference; it’s implicit. So, deﬁning what looks like a “global” is actually deﬁning in the scope of the window object. This object is the global scope, in JavaScript.  This is all well and good, but there is one critical gotcha: if the function invocation does not use its speciﬁc object, you lose the binding. The most common case for this is when you pass a method as an argument to be invoked later. It then reverts to the default window binding. Just look at the following code:  Download prototype steroids binding-method.js  var CoolObj = {  name: 'Joe the cool object',  getName: function   {  return this.name;  }  }; window.name = '';  CoolObj.getName      -> 'Joe the cool object'  function callFx fx  {  return fx  ;  }  callFx CoolObj.getName     -> ''  window.name = 'The window'; callFx CoolObj.getName    PROPER FUNCTION BINDING  60     -> 'The window'  Now that’s a serious issue. Passing methods around is frequent, espe- cially in Prototype, where just about every other method accepts an iterator argument  just look at Enumerable! . To ﬁx this, Prototype gives Function some love with two new methods  yes, methods on functions; bear with me here :  bind thisRef [, arg... ]  → boundFunction bindAsEventListener thisRef [, arg... ]  → boundFunction  Let us focus on bind    ﬁrst. The most common usage scenario involves only the mandatory ﬁrst argument, which is the object you want to be bound, at execution time, to the this reference. For instance, using a variant of our previous example, we get this:  Download prototype steroids bind.js  var CoolObj = {  name: 'Joe the cool object',  getName: function   {  return this.name;  }  };  }  CoolObj.getName      -> 'Joe the cool object'  function callFx fx  {  return fx  ;  Download prototype steroids bind-saved.js  var CoolObj = {  name: 'Joe the cool object',  getName: function   {  return this.name;  }  };  CoolObj.getName    callFx CoolObj.getName.bind CoolObj      -> 'Joe the cool object'  Of course, we do not need to call bind    every time. If we use the bound version quite a lot  or quite often, as in a loop , it would be wasteful to do so, too. We’ll be better off binding once and for all and keeping the bound version on hand for later uses:   PROPER FUNCTION BINDING  61     -> 'Joe the cool object'  function callFx fx  {  return fx  ;  }     WRONG: creates a new bound function on each iteration! for  var index = 1; index <= 42; ++index   callFx CoolObj.getName.bind CoolObj  ;     RIGHT: caches the bound version var boundGetName = CoolObj.getName.bind CoolObj ; for  var index = 1; index <= 42; ++index   callFx boundGetName ;  Preﬁlling Arguments with bind Here’s a little-used, albeit cool, extra trick: bind    also lets you prepend the actual call with speciﬁc arguments; whatever arguments will be provided to the bound version will get appended to the predeﬁned call. This is technically referred to as partial function application:  Download prototype steroids bind-args.js  var CoolObj = { name: 'Joe',  getCallDef: function   {  var call = 'getCallDef "' + this.name + '"'; var extraArgs = arguments.length > 0 ? ', ' + $A arguments .join ', '  : '';  return call + extraArgs + ' ';  }  };  CoolObj.getCallDef      -> 'getCallDef "Joe" '  function callFx fx  {  return fx 4, 5 ;  }  var boundCall = CoolObj.getCallDef.bind CoolObj, 1, 2, 3 ;  callFx boundCall     -> 'getCallDef "Joe", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 '  This is pretty useful when you want to pass your method around, pre- ﬁlled with a few arguments. For instance, maybe you have this generic method that takes a behavior mode string and then one or more ele-   YOUR FUNCTIONS ACTUALLY KNOW MORE TRICKS  62  ments to process; you would then want to pass it with a preﬁlled mode argument to another part of your script, which would call it only with the elements to process. Using bind    with the mode value produces such a “prepared” method wrapper.  That’s it for bind   . By now you’re probably wondering what bindAsEv- entListener    is about. Well, Prototype provides a uniﬁed management of events in your browser window, which is great. As we’ll see in much detail in Section 6.1, The Art of Observing Events, on page 112, properly registered event handler methods take the current event object as their ﬁrst argument. But maybe you realized several handlers were very sim- ilar and refactored them in a single one, which now just needs an extra parameter or two so it can adjust its behavior slightly. And still you’d need the event parameter being passed ﬁrst, as it usually is. That’s what bindAsEventListener    is for, essentially. It works like bind   , but it preserves the current event as the ﬁrst argument. For more examples and details, look at Section 6.1, Methods as Listeners: Careful with the Binding!, on page 114.  As a ﬁnal note, know that failing to pass an argument to bind    makes it moot  it returns the original function . This behavior was added in Pro- totype 1.6 to facilitate generic code  that may or may not bind a passed function depending on whether a context argument was passed , such as in Enumerable.  4.3 Your Functions Actually Know More Tricks  Proper binding is key to a lot of object-oriented JavaScript code tech- niques, but Prototype offers even more nifty tools since version 1.6.  Preﬁlling Arguments fx.curry arg...  → Function  Often we ﬁnd ourselves needing to pass a method around, but we need to preﬁll one or more arguments. For instance, we have a split    method handy, but we’d like to pass it preﬁlled with ’:’ as a delimiter.  Typically, we’d ﬁnd ourselves doing something like this:     WRONG: prefer curry :-  String.prototype.splitOnColons = function   { return this.split ':' ; }    ... '1:2:3:4'.splitOnColons      => ['1', '2', '3', '4']   YOUR FUNCTIONS ACTUALLY KNOW MORE TRICKS  63  That’s really too verbose for the need. Enter curry   , whose name comes straight out of the functional programming world, where this feature has existed for a long time:  String.prototype.splitOnColons = String.prototype.split.curry ':' ;  No manual tricks with anonymous functions anymore. Oh, and should we fail to pass argument  who knows, rough night perhaps? , it will return the original function untouched, avoiding the cost of an anony- mous wrapper function. But wait, there’s more.  Executing Later fx.delay timeoutInSecs [, arg... ]  → timeoutHandle fx.defer  [arg... ]  → timeoutHandle  When dealing with events, DOM updates, or Ajax calls, we often need to execute a given function, only not just now but in a few moments. There are actually two use cases here:    We’re going to have to wait for some time to elapse. Perhaps we want to trigger some behavior only after a while, such as initiating a drag on a clickable element only when the mouse button stays down long enough  which it won’t on a regular click  or delaying the appearance of a custom tooltip. That’s what delay    is for.    We just need the browser to take recent DOM updates into ac- count, perhaps to actually display our indicator before running our Ajax call. All we need is to give the browser a little breathing time with no JavaScript load and then get back to our code. Typi- cally, this is done with a tiny, 10-millisecond delayed execution. And this is exactly what defer    does.  Here are example calls:  function showQuestion qId  {     Show question, move to next in 5 seconds. loadQuestion.delay 5, ++qId ;  }     Giving the browser time to breathe, and render DOM updates: $ 'indicator' .show  ; postNewComment.defer  ;  As a cute side note, defer    is just a curried version of delay   :  Function.prototype.defer = Function.prototype.delay.curry 0.01 ;  I told you curry    was nice. . . .   YOUR FUNCTIONS ACTUALLY KNOW MORE TRICKS  64  Note that on all JavaScript implementations that Prototype supports, a deferred  or delayed  call will execute only after the current function completes.  Wrapping and Playing with Arguments fx.wrap wrapper [, arg... ]  → Function fx.argumentNames   → [ String, ... ]  Another cool tool is the ability to wrap a function in another wrapper function  if you’re used to functional programming, that’s a compose operation . This can spare us a few tricks with anonymous function and proper binding, too.  The biggest advantage here, probably, is the ability to modify the behav- ior of existing code, in a way akin to aspect-oriented programming  AOP , by wrapping the behavioral changes as a layer around the origi- nal code.  Here’s a nice example that shows how to log all events by piggybacking on the event extension method  which equips all event objects with the event-related extended methods, as we’ll see in Chapter 6, Uniﬁed Event Handling, on page 108 :  if  Event.extend === Prototype.K  Event.extend = function x { return x }; Event.extend = Event.extend.wrap function proceed, event {  proceed event ; if event.type == 'mousemove'  return;    That would slow us down too much console.log  event.eventNameevent.type +' on ' + event.target +    event.target.id ? ' '+event.target.id : ''   + ' [' + event.pageX + ' ' + event.pageY + ']' ;  } ;  The idea is to provide wrap    with your wrapper function  you call wrap    on the function you want to wrap around . The wrapper function will be passed, when called, the original function as its ﬁrst argument, and “actual” arguments  those passed to your newly wrapped function later by user code  follow.  Prototype also ﬁnds it increasingly useful to examine the names of a function’s arguments, especially in conjunction with wrapping  we use it to implement the new inheritance mechanism, for instance . argu- mentNames    provides a safe way to obtain a list of the argument names for the function we’re calling it on, so we can implement, say, opt-in aspects based on speciﬁc argument names. Here’s a simple example:  'hello'.gsub.argumentNames      => ['pattern', 'replacement']   NUMBERS  65  “Methodizing”: Functions Looking Like Methods It often happens that existing features are provided in a traditional, function-based manner. You’d pass the object being processed as the ﬁrst argument, with whatever parameters are needed as later argu- ments. In an object light, this is not very good form. We would prefer to be able to invoke the method on the object itself, passing only further arguments as necessary.  You can see such a duality at work in Prototype’s DOM extensions, with most features being accessible as functions  for example, by passing your element, possibly unextended, to Element.update     but are also available as methods on extended elements  so you would just call the element, the update    method .  This recurring pattern is captured by the methodize    extension to func- tions:  fx.methodize  [arg... ]  → Function  This provides a new function that will, when called as a method on any given object, pass this object as the ﬁrst argument to the origi- nal function. You can also preﬁll extra arguments by passing them to methodize   .  As an example, consider some of the extensions to Number described in the next section. The abs   , ceil   , ﬂoor   , and round    methods are just “methodized” versions of their function counterparts in the native Math object. Here’s the code for it:  $w 'abs round ceil floor' .each function method {  Number.prototype[method] = Math[method].methodize    } ;  Isn’t that sweet?  4.4 Numbers  It often comes as a surprise to everyone except JavaScript gurus, but numbers are indeed objects in JavaScript. Hey, that’s just like in Ruby!  For instance, ECMAScript-compliant numbers  as of the third edition, which is roughly JavaScript 1.5  feature, among other methods, toString    and toFixed   .  What, you never used those?   NUMBERS  66  Download prototype steroids numbers_ecma.js  Math.PI.toString      -> '3.141592653589793'   42 .toString 16     -> '2a'  parseInt '42', 11 .toString 9     -> '51'  51 in base 9 is 42 in base 11   Math.sqrt 2 .toFixed 4     -> '1.4142'   5   3 .toFixed 6     -> '1.666667'   3.141596 .toString      -> '3.141596'  And there are more. Still, there are many common needs that still cry to be addressed. Prototype goes ahead and answers several of them with a slew of new methods:  abs   → Number ceil   → Number floor   → Number round   → Number succ   → Number times iterator  → sameNumber toColorPart   → hexString toPaddedString length [, radix = 10]  → String  The four ﬁrst ones are just convenience wrappers around their Math counterparts, so instead of writing this:  Math.round n  Math.abs n   . . . we can do this:  n.round   n.abs    The second method, succ   , is there only to make Numbers compatible with object ranges  n.succ   will return n + 1 . We already had a peek at them in Section 3.8, Handling Ranges with $R, on page 50, and we will get deeper into them in Section 10.2, Expressing Ranges of. . . Well, Anything You Want!, on page 230. But essentially, this means we can do stuff like $R 1, 42 , which is a range of numbers. In short, this method is mostly for Prototype’s internal use.   NUMBERS  67  Prototype also sprinkles Number with Ruby-ﬂavored powder by provid- ing it with a times    method, which lets us do zero-based numerical loops in a rather straightforward and very legible way:  Download prototype steroids number_times.js   5 .times function   { alert "Isn't this annoying?" ; } ;     With anything that is not a literal number, you don't need the extra    parentheses: var count = parseInt $F 'soundCount' , 10 ; count.times playSound ;  This is just so nice on the eyes. . . . Who would want to get back to vanilla for loops once this kind of syntax is available?  The fourth addition to Number is speciﬁcally geared toward CSS color string creation. As you probably know, CSS lets you specify colors in a variety of syntaxes, including reserved color names  such as white , six- digit hexadecimal color codes  such as a0cf26 , three-digit hexadecimal codes  for example, dd0 , and long-winded function-style deﬁnitions  something like rgb 220, 220, 0  .  I am fond of the three-digit form myself, which is the shorter syntax and also makes for “safer” colors  colors that have a better chance of being properly rendered on devices with less than 24-bit color resolution . The idea is that, essentially, rgb is equivalent to rrggbb. This decreases the amount of possibilities by a 212 factor, leaving you with 4,096 colors.  Still, in order to provide maximum ﬂexibility, toColorPart    goes for the six-digit game. The idea is that whenever you want to create a hexadec- imal code for CSS color properties based on computed values in Java- Script, you have to struggle a bit or write the same boilerplate all over again. Even the native toString radix  method doesn’t help you much, because it will produce a single digit for values less than 16. So, toCol- orPart    provides a lowercase, two-digit hexadecimal representation of your number, which is assumed to be an integer in the valid range for a color component  red, green or blue : 0 to 255.  Therefore, you can deal quite easily with CSS color composition:  Download prototype steroids number_toColorPart.js  var rgb = [220, 110, 0]; '' + rgb.invoke 'toColorPart' .join ''     -> 'dc6e00'   Finally, there’s a simple toPaddedString    method that lets you output a minimum-width, zero-padded representation of your number, in any radix  or base  you want:  STRINGS  68  Download prototype steroids number_toPaddedString.js   5 .toPaddedString 2     => '05'   42 .toPaddedString 4, 16     => '002a'  It can be useful, for instance, when formatting dates or times as strings, because numerical components usually mandate two characters.  4.5 Strings  Strings and arrays are probably the two richest types in native Java- Script; they come with tens of methods out of the box. But because they are so essential to just about any kind of processing, there is still plenty of room for useful improvement. Prototype endows them with numerous new methods, which I’ll explain for you now, organized by theme.  Trimming the Fat: strip, stripTags, stripScripts, and truncate Let’s start with methods aimed at removing extra stuff in the string. All of those return the new version of the string:  strip   → String stripScripts   → String stripTags   → String truncate  [length = 30 [, truncation = '...'] ]  → String  For starters, strip    is the equivalent of the classic  but missing  trim   ; it chops out leading and trailing whitespace. stripTags    purges any open- ing or closing tag but does not remove whatever lies between an opening tag and its closing match. stripScripts    is, in some regard, more surgi- cal; it strips out any   element, with its contents and closing tag. Finally, truncate    chops text that is longer than its length argu- ment, which will be used for the ﬁnal length of the truncated version, including the truncation text. So if your text is, say, 35 characters long ending with “too bad really” and you’re truncating to 30 characters, you’ll end up with “too ba...”.   STRINGS  69  Here is a combined example for these methods:  Download prototype steroids string_strips.js  var spacedOutText = ' var markup = ' This is marked up text \n' + ' See, there are  tags . ';  Hello there!\n';  var scriptMarkup = ' Okay, still marked up \n' +  ' But this time we have scripts as well. \n' + ' \n' + 'window.location.href = "http:  ooo-bad-sitey.com scam_me";\n' + ' \n' + ' End of markup. ';  var longText = 'This text is sort of too long for my taste, you know.';  spacedOutText.strip      -> 'Hello there!'  markup.stripTags      -> 'This is marked up text\nSee, there are tags.'  scriptMarkup.stripTags      -> 'Okay, still marked up\nBut this time we have scripts as well.\n\n' +        'window.location.href = "http:  ooo-bad-sitey.com scam_me";\n\n' + 'End of markup.'  scriptMarkup.stripScripts      -> ' Okay, still marked up \n' +        ' But this time we have scripts as well. \n\n' + ' End of markup. '  longText.truncate      -> 'This text is sort of too lo...'  longText.truncate 42     -> 'This text is sort of too long for my ta...'  longText.truncate 42, '~'     -> 'This text is sort of too long for my tast~'  Transformations: sub, gsub, escapeHTML, unescapeHTML, camelize, capitalize, underscore, dasherize, scan, and succ Numerous extensions deal with string transformation, which can be sorted out among three categories:  un escaping, part-based format- ting, and search and replace.  succ   → String  The method succ    falls out of these three categories, however, because its primary use is to make strings range-compatible  make them usable   STRINGS  70  with $R    and ObjectRange; for more about this, look at Section 10.2, Expressing Ranges of. . . Well, Anything You Want!, on page 230 .   Un escaping HTML escapeHTML   → String unescapeHTML   → String  Prototype provides a bulletproof way of escaping HTML, based on using a DOM trick. Usage is simple: escapeHTML    “defangs” an HTML frag- ment by replacing whatever is needed in there  mostly opening and clos- ing angle brackets  with the corresponding HTML entities. Conversely, unescapeHTML    turns an escaped HTML string into literal HTML.  Here are two demo calls:  Download prototype steroids string_escaping.js  ' A nice title '.escapeHTML      -> '&lt;h1&gt;A nice title&lt; h1&gt;'  '&lt;h1&gt;A nice title&lt; h1&gt;'.unescapeHTML      -> ' A nice title '  Part-Based Formatting camelize   → String capitalize   → String dasherize   → String underscore   → String  Prototype provides many methods taken straight out of Ruby’s  or Rail’s extension of  String class. These are mostly useful for turning part-based strings into suitable IDs, CSS class names, and the like.  camelize    turns a hyphenized string into an upper camel string  a string with no delimiters between parts, but each part starts with an uppercase letter . Note that only the ﬁrst characters of each part are transformed; the rest is left untouched. It is very useful, for instance, to turn CSS property names into their DOM property names. A usual method as well is capitalize   , which quite simply capitalizes the ﬁrst letter and puts the remainder in lowercase.  The story is more complex on underscore   , which does hail straight from Ruby on Rails shores and is capable of turning virtually any iden- tiﬁer name into an underscore-delimited lowercased string. This is more sophisticated than other methods, because it does not chop the string in parts based on a single delimiter character. It looks for hyphens  -  and case changes  from lowercase to uppercase, although it also   STRINGS  71  handles uppercase sequences properly . It actually goes beyond that, dealing with double colons  which are replaced by slashes , but that is rather seldom useful in a web page context.  Finally, dasherize    is a simple conversion from underscores to hyphens. After explaining underscore   , it is a bit of an anticlimax, I’ll give you that. But combining both lets us easily turn CSS-related DOM proper- ties into their regular CSS names. Just a thought.  With all those details, I’m sure you’d love a nice dollop of examples. Here, my treat:  Download prototype steroids string_transfos.js  'border'.camelize      -> 'border'  'border-style'.camelize      -> 'borderStyle'  'border-sTYLE'.camelize      -> 'borderSTYLE'    See?  'border-left-color'.camelize      -> 'borderLeftColor'  'borderLeftColor'.underscore      -> 'border_left_color'  Leaving non-initials untouched.  'borderLeftColor'.underscore  .dasherize      -> 'border-left-color'  'Draft-WHATWebForms1'.underscore      -> 'draft_what_web_forms1'  'cool stuff'.capitalize      -> 'Cool stuff'  'COOL STUFF'.capitalize      -> 'Cool stuff'    Lower-casing the remainder, too.  Advanced Replacing gsub pattern, replacementiterator  → String interpolate scopeObject [, pattern]  → String scan pattern, iterator  → sameString sub pattern, replacementiterator [, count = 1]  → String  This leaves us with the two more advanced methods: sub    and gsub   . They let us replace one or more occurrences of a given regular expres- sion with either a template string or the result of calling an iterator   STRINGS  72  function over the match description. This is a bit more advanced than what the native String.replace    method lets us do  plus, browsers such as Safari 1.x and early 2.x do not all fully implement replace    yet when it comes to replace functions .  To properly understand how to use these, you must know how regular expression matches are provided in JavaScript. Speciﬁcally, you do not get a String back; you get either null  no match  or a MatchData object. Sufﬁce to say that such an object can be used like an array of matched groups, with index 0  zero  being the whole match and indices from 1 up are groups within the match. Remember that in regular expres- sions, you can group fragments for later reference by enclosing them in parentheses.  A vanilla2 example should help clarify this:  Download prototype steroids string_match.js  var md = 'Hey guys!'.match  ^ .  \w+   ; md[0]    -> 'Hey' md[1]    -> 'H' md[2]    -> 'ey'  You have two ways of specifying replacements in sub    and gsub   — either by using a template string or by providing an iterator function.  Template strings use Ruby’s expansion syntax: {...}, where you would specify the match object’s property name between the curly braces  if you need more details right now about template processing, check out Section 10.4, Templating Made Easy, on page 233 . Here, the properties amount to the numerical indices described earlier.  You can also specify a custom behavior by passing an iterator function, which will get called with the MatchData instance as an argument and whose return value will be used as a replacement.  Finally, know that the only difference between gsub    and sub    is that the former replaces all occurrences, while the latter can replace a spe- ciﬁc amount, defaulting to only the ﬁrst one.  2.

In short, this is a particular use case for gsub   . Well, this is exactly what scan    does for you.

Version 1.6 also introduced the interpolate    method, which is just a convenience wrapper over the one-shot creation of a Template object based on the current string as its template text. See Section 10.4, Tem- plating Made Easy, on page 233 for details.   Script Fragments: extractScripts and evalScripts Prototype-enabled pages often deal with strings containing HTML mark- up, most often in Ajax responses. You may need to take scripts out of the markup, holding on to it for later evaluation.  STRINGS  74   STRINGS  75  Or you may just want to evaluate the scripts in an HTML fragment:  extractScripts   → [ JSString, ... ] evalScripts   → [ resultValue, ... ]  If you need the scripts in a HTML fragment, just call extractScripts   . It returns an array of scripts  without their enclosing   tags, just pure JavaScript . If you want to eval    all the scripts in a fragment, go directly with evalScripts   . As a bonus, it will return an array of all the result values for said scripts  a script with no speciﬁc return value yields undeﬁned . By the way, do not mistake extractScripts    with strip- Scripts     which strips the scripts out of the fragment and returns the expurgated fragment .  Converting and Extracting: toQueryParams, parseQuery, toArray, and inspect We’ll end this exploration of String extensions with a few methods turn- ing strings into some other representation of their contents:  inspect  [useDoubleQuotes = false]  → String parseQuery toQueryParams  [separator = '&']  → Object toArray   → [ char, ... ]  We already heard about the inspect    method back in Section 4.1, Intro- specting Objects, on page 54. With strings, it takes an extra customiza- tion, letting you bracket its text with either single quotes  the default  or double quotes. It basically escapes backslashes, special characters such as tabulations and carriage returns, and the proper quote type within the string.  If you want to handle a String like an Array of characters, you can go with toArray     and therefore, get concise with $A    .  Finally, Prototype provides String with a URL-related decoding method, aimed at turning the query string part of a URL  lengthy stuff like name=john&text=cool%20stuff&show=yes  into a set of properties. You can even use it on strings that are not quite query-string-like and use another delimiter than the ampersand  &  simply by passing an alter- native delimiter  which can very well be longer than a single character . Also note this method is aliased, making it available under two names. Use whichever suits you best: parseQuery    or toQueryParams   .   ARRAYS  76  The result is an anonymous object whose properties mirror the param- eters in the query string. If multiple parameters share the same name, there is only one property, and its value is an array of parameter val- ues. Of course, proper decoding is done on both parameter names and parameter values, thanks to the native decodeURIComponent    method.  As a ﬁnal usage note, be aware that an anchor  the trailing ... part, which usually refers to an id= or name= attribute within the document , if present, is ignored.  Here are a few example calls for these methods:  Download prototype steroids string_convs.js  'Sam Stephenson\nThomas \'madrobby\' Fuchs'.inspect      -> "'Sam Stephenson\\nThomas \\'madrobby\\' Fuchs'"  'Sam Stephenson\nThomas \'madrobby\' Fuchs'.inspect true     -> "\"Sam Stephenson\\nThomas 'madrobby' Fuchs\""  'hello'.toArray      -> ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']  $A 'hello'     -> ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']  var query = '?login=tdd&age=29&country=FR'; query.parseQuery      -> { login: 'tdd', age: '29', country: 'FR' }  Searching for Contents: startsWith, endsWith, and include These are three no-brainer methods that just let you do away with any roundabout use of indexOf   :  endsWith string  → Boolean include string  → Boolean startsWith string  → Boolean  Usage is pretty self-explanatory. . . . I don’t think you need an example of those, do you?  4.6 Arrays  Arrays are already resourceful objects in native JavaScript. They are endowed with a fair amount of methods, the most common ones prob- ably being push   , concat   , join   , pop   , and shift   . If your eyes are   ARRAYS  77  Playing Nice to the Latest JavaScript  Prototype goes out of its way to smooth things over with recent JavaScript versions, starting with 1.6.    It homogenizes its API extensions to those proposed by ofﬁcial JavaScript  for example, it features aliases such as ﬁlter    and every    over array methods it originally calls select    and all    .    It relies on native implementations of its features when- ever possible for performance reasons  for example, the enumeration of arrays will use the native forEach    when present .  goggling just now, I advise you to take a look at Array again, such as at DevMo3 or W3Schools.4 Still, there is much room for improvement.  In Prototype, arrays are probably the richest objects of all. First, they mix in the Enumerable module, which brings in a host of great methods, as we will see in Chapter 5, Advanced Collections with Enumerable, on page 88. Second, they get an extra load of extensions, which we are going to discuss now. The net result is simple; arrays in Prototype are very much more powerful than you would expect. They do feel like they are on steroids!  As was the case for String, the sheer amount of new methods is better reviewed in categories. Do remember that this section alone does not account for all that Prototype brings to arrays. At the time of this writ- ing, arrays have no less than 35 outward-facing5 extra methods, either through Enumerable or speciﬁcally for Array, thanks to Prototype. Factor in the native methods described in JavaScript 1.5, and arrays feature a whopping 47 “public” methods. . . .  Enumerating an Array As Array mixes Enumerable in, it obviously features its cornerstone each    method. I just want to make it perfectly clear  although it is fairly  3. http:  developer.mozilla.org en docs JavaScript 4. http:  w3schools.com js js_obj_array.asp 5. That is, designed for public use, as opposed to internal use.   ARRAYS  78  evident  that iteration happens in increasing numerical index order, from 0  zero  to length - 1.  However, there is the question of sparse arrays. Sparse arrays are arrays where you manually assign values to nonadjacent indices, some- thing like this:  var a = []; a[0] = 'foo'; a[10] = 'bar';  Using a regular fast loop, you would iterate over the “missing” indices  1 to 9 , with undeﬁned values. But starting with version 1.6, Prototype leverages the native forEach    method in JavaScript arrays when it is available  recent enough JavaScript version , and this method will not iterate through undeﬁned indices. You’ll get index 0 for foo and index 1 for bar.  The thing is, using sparse arrays is using arrays instead of hashes  which, in JavaScript, are any literal object . Arrays are designed for sequential, integer-based indexing—not sparse population, which is what hashes are for. So when you ﬁnd yourself playing with sparse arrays, either convert to a hash or explicitly deﬁne the missing indices. Here’s the hash version, on which enumeration iterates only on the deﬁned properties:  var a = {};    Note the curly braces instead of square brackets a[0] = 'foo'; a[10] = 'bar';  However, I should mention that property iteration order is undeﬁned in JavaScript; it is essentially browser-dependent. One browser may go 0 and then 10, and another one may go 10 and then 0—there’s no guarantee. It’s usually no big deal, though. If worse comes to worst, you can grab the keys, sort them, and iterate on the sorted list.  As of Prototype 1.6, if the native JavaScript method forEach    is avail- able on arrays, it is used instead of manual iteration.  Transformations: clear, compact, ﬂatten, intersect, reverse, reduce, uniq, and without Prototype introduces many methods to speciﬁcally alter the contents, or even the structure, of an array:  clear   → emptiedArray compact   → newArray flatten   → Array   ARRAYS  79  intersect Array  → Array reduce   → Array  singleValue reverse  [inline = true]  → Array uniq  [sorted = false]  → Array without value...  → Array  Most of these methods are easy to understand and use. A few deal with removing unwanted elements: clear    removes them all, return- ing the original array, now empty; compact    returns a new version exempt of any null or undeﬁned element; intersect    returns a new set of the elements that exist both in the current array and in the one passed as a parameter  using the === operator for comparisons ;6uniq    returns a new version devoid of any duplicate, while retaining the orig- inal order; ﬁnally, without value...  returns a new version purged of any of the passed arguments.  If you call uniq    on a large array that is already sorted, tell it so. It’ll work in linear time instead of quadratic time, resulting in a signiﬁcant performance boost.  A common operation when dealing with recursively built arrays is ﬂat- ten   . As its name implies, it takes an arbitrarily nested array and turns it into its “ﬂat”  linear  equivalence, using depth-ﬁrst traversal; check the next example code for a demo. Another structural method is reduce   , which leaves multiple-element arrays untouched but turns single-element arrays into their unique element. Imagine gathering all the values for a given form ﬁeld name; if you end up with only one value, as will most commonly be the case, you want to spare external code the need to index your result with [0]. You could use reduce    on the array of values you got from the initial collection process.  Finally, reverse    lets you reverse the contents of an array. Unless you explicitly pass false as its optional inline argument, it will reverse the array itself. Otherwise, it clones the original array and reverses the copy. In both cases, the reversed array is returned. As an interesting note, reverse    exists, strictly inline, as a native method for JavaScript arrays. Prototype replaces it with this version that lets you choose whether you want inline reversal, which delegates to the native one unless you need to leave the original array untouched.  6. Beware: it starts by using uniq    on the current array, which may have performance impacts as discussed in the next paragraph.   ARRAYS  80  Theory is good but is no substitute for actual code:  Download prototype steroids array_transfos.js  var easy = [42, 'Hey', NaN, 'fellas', null, "What's up?"]; var harder = [42, ['Hey', [NaN], 'fellas'], null, [[["What's up?"]]]];  easy.reverse      easy: ["What's up?", null, 'fellas', NaN, 'Hey', 42] easy.reverse false     -> [42, 'Hey', NaN, 'fellas', null, "What's up?"]    easy: ["What's up?", null, 'fellas', NaN, 'Hey', 42]  var easy2 = harder.flatten      -> [42, 'Hey', NaN, 'fellas', null, "What's up?"]  easy2 = easy2.without NaN, 'fellas' .compact      -> [42, 'Hey', NaN, "What's up?"]    Remember NaN != NaN...  easy2.clear      easy2: []  [].reduce   [1].reduce   [1, 2, 3].reduce      -> [1, 2, 3]     -> undefined    -> 1  [1, 2, 3, 7, 2, 5, 7, 4, 8].uniq      -> [1, 2, 3, 7, 5, 4, 8]  Conversions: from and inspect Array.from iterable  → Array inspect   → String  If you fail to see the difference between Array.from    and the $A    utility function, it is because there is none. These are aliases, and the latter form is simply the preferred one, thanks to its conciseness. See Sec- tion 3.5, $A, the Collection Uniﬁer, on page 47 for full details on how Array.from    works.  We already discussed inspect    methods, particularly in Section 4.1, Introspecting Objects, on page 54. The Array version produces a string of the form [item1, item2... itemN], using Object.inspect    on each item. Here are a few examples:  Download prototype steroids array_convs.js  Array.from === $A    -> true  Array.from 'hello'     -> ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']   ARRAYS  81  $A {0: 'What kind', 1: 'of twisted', 2: 'example is this?', length: 3}     [ 'What kind', 'of twisted', 'example is this?']  [42, 'hello', Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY, []].inspect      -> "[42, 'hello', Infinity, []]"  Extractions: ﬁrst, last, and indexOf Prototype provides a few extra methods to quickly get at speciﬁc ele- ments in an array:  first   → value indexOf value  → position lastIndexOf value  → position last   → value  We often need to get at the ﬁrst, or last, element of an array. Although writing arr[0] is certainly easy enough, arr[arr.length - 1] leaves a bitter taste. This is why Prototype introduces ﬁrst    and last   , whose names are self-explanatory. Note that on empty arrays, they yield undeﬁned.  Another fairly common need is to determine whether an element exists in an array and where it is. Mere presence is better addressed by the include    method mixed in from Enumerable, but actual position can be obtained by indexOf   , which encapsulates the all-too-common numer- ical loop over a == operator. In the usual fashion, it returns -1 if the element is not found and otherwise returns the index of its ﬁrst occur- rence. Note that because it uses == instead of ===, you must be careful about equivalences, such as 0 == false == ” and null == undeﬁned. If a value may be present multiple times, you may want to differentiate between its ﬁrst and last positions. Use lastIndexOf    for the latter case.  Here are a few quick lines to get the hang of these simple methods:  Download prototype steroids array_extracts.js  [].first      -> undefined  [1, 2, 3].first      -> 1  [].last      -> undefined  [1, 2, 3].last      -> 3  ['Hey', 'fellas', "What's up?"].indexOf 'fellas'     -> 1   FULL-SPECTRUM JSON SUPPOR T  82  ['Hey', 'fellas', "What's up?"].indexOf 'Fellas'     -> -1  String == String is case-sensitive   [0, 1, 2, 3].indexOf ''     -> 0  0 == ''   Optimizations: clone, size, and toArray Sometimes code exists in a generic fashion that could be optimized locally for Array. Prototype usually takes the smart road and introduces local optimizations or type-speciﬁc variants.  clone toArray   → newArray size   → Number  The clone    method is not an override of a mixed-in method but pro- vides a type-speciﬁc alternative to the slower Object.clone    method discussed in Section 4.1, Cloning and Extending Objects, on page 56. It basically relies on the native concat    method.  Aliasing toArray    over clone    does override the toArray    method mixed in from Enumerable, and this is a good thing: Enumerable’s version is signiﬁcantly slower, because it requires manually iterating over all the elements  because of its generic nature .  Finally, size    also overrides the mixed-in version, which required prior array conversion, something that would, on actual arrays, be utterly unnecessary, not to mention wasteful. It simply uses the array’s native length property.  These methods are straightforward enough that I believe there is no need for example code here. If you insist on seeing code, just look at the generic versions of toArray    and size    in Chapter 5, Advanced Col- lections with Enumerable, on page 88.  The Case of Opera and concat As an interesting note, by November 2006 Opera did not implement the native concat    method properly. This was noticed by Thomas Fuchs, who tweaked Prototype so that it now replaces  on Opera only  the native version with a “guaranteed” one.  4.7 Full-Spectrum JSON Support  Version 1.5.1 introduced full support for JSON, thanks to the tireless efforts of Tobie Langel.   FULL-SPECTRUM JSON SUPPOR T  83  Joe Asks. . .  Hang on. . . What’s This JSON Thingy?  JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It’s a simple rep- resentation of any object as text using only standard Java- Script syntax for literal values  objects, arrays, strings, num- bers, booleans, and so on .  It was formalized by Douglas Crockford, noted JavaScript guru. The speciﬁcation is available at http:  json.org.  The major advantage of JSON is that it’s trivial to produce and parse in JavaScript, no matter how rich and structured the information may be. This makes it a tasty format for exchanging complex information with a server through, say, Ajax. It’s rapidly becoming prevalent over XML in this use case.  The resulting API is as follows:  Object.toJSON obj  → String array.toJSON   → String date.toJSON   → String hash.toJSON   → String number.toJSON   → String string.toJSON   → String jsonString.evalJSON  [sanitize = false]  → Object  Converting Any Object to JSON The generic way of turning a JavaScript value into its JSON representa- tion is to call Object.toJSON   , passing it the value. It honors the JSON serialization mechanism, which basically means the following:    Functions, DOM elements, undeﬁned, and exotic stuff7 are ignored.   null and booleans are represented literally.   If the object features a toJSON    method, it is used; Prototype does equip all relevant types  see the API block in the prior section  with appropriate toJSON    methods. It even equips Date with one  7. For instance, in Internet Explorer, objects that are accessed across a COM+ bridge, which makes dear old Internet Explorer’s typeof burp the nonstandard ’unknown’ value.   FULL-SPECTRUM JSON SUPPOR T  84  serialization method, which uses a format akin to W3DTF  for example, 2007-04-29T22:53:49 .    Otherwise, the object is manually serialized, iterating over its properties and using Object.toJSON    on each one, in a recursive fashion.  Here’s a small example:  Download prototype steroids json_serializing.js  var undef; Object.toJSON undef     => '' Object.toJSON null     => 'null'  var doudou = { first: 'Élodie', last: 'Jaubert',  birthDate: new Date 1980, 9, 29 ,    0 == January gang: [ 'Camille', 'Clotilde', 'Diane' ], getJob: function   { return 'Chef du monde' }, blond: false  }; Object.toJSON doudou ;     single-line value, wrapped here, assuming we're GMT+1 in Fall     => '{"first": "Élodie", "last": "Jaubert",        "birthDate": "1980-10-28T23:00:00Z", "gang": ["Camille", "Clotilde", "Diane"], "blond": false}'  Converting a JSON Representation to an Object Turning a JSON text into actual JavaScript objects  an arbitrarily com- plex object, which can be regarded as a tree of objects, basically  is done through the new evalJSON    method added to String. This simply returns the resulting object, which you can then use as any vanilla JavaScript object.  Here’s a bit for taste:  Download prototype steroids json_deserializing.js  '[1, 2, 3]'.evalJSON      => [1, 2, 3]  var doudou = '{"first": "Élodie", "last": "Jaubert"}'.evalJSON  ; doudou.first    => 'Élodie' doudou.last    => 'Jaubert'   FULL-SPECTRUM JSON SUPPOR T  85  JSON and Security Prototype offers two features regarding JSON security.  The ﬁrst one is JSON sanitizing. It will validate that the JSON text fol- lows the accepted syntax and does not contain any attempt at tricking the JavaScript evaluator into undesirable processing  for example, dis- closing sensitive information . You can enable it by passing true as an argument to the evalJSON    method. If you’re using an Ajax requester or updater  see Chapter 9, Ajax Has Never Been So Easy, on page 186 , there’s a sanitizeJSON option that lets you request this for automatic JSON evaluation.  The second one lets you wrap JSON data with special “ﬁlter” text that aims to defeat JavaScript hijacking, a recently discovered security hole.8 The default ﬁlter, represented by the Prototype.JSONFilter regular expres- sion, has you start with  *-secure- and ﬁnish with *   with allowed whitespace after that . Such a wrapper is automatically stripped by evalJSON   .  Still, these are by no means silver bullets. They provide a rough security improvement, but as with any data format that can contain active code and can go through an eval   -like call, you should be extra careful about the reliability and security of your JSON exchanges.  So, What Did We Learn Here?  We sure covered a lot of ground in this chapter: Prototype’s augmen- tation of native JavaScript capabilities and types is quite impressive. Let’s take a minute to recap the main points we’ve gone through:    The for. . . in loop is not intended to iterate over arrays; it iterates over an object’s properties. We should not use it to go through an array’s integer-indexed values and should rely on a regular loop or a prebaked enumeration instead.    Most type detections  for example, whether something is an array, a string, a function. . .   are straightforwardly available as Object. is...    methods.  8. For all the details, read up on it at http:  www.fortifysoftware.com servlet downloads public JavaScript_Hijacking.pdf.   FULL-SPECTRUM JSON SUPPOR T  86    Numbers are actual objects, and they are replete with cool meth- ods, either from native JavaScript  such as toFixed     or thanks to Prototype extensions  such as ceil    and toPaddedString    .    Strings gain a lot of mojo with Prototype, especially when content transformation is concerned. Stripping, replacing, splitting, and converting to and from syntaxes and URLs—it’s all there for the taking!    Arrays are even more powerful; already well-endowed by native JavaScript, they become über-collections thanks to Prototype, with close to 50 public-facing methods. Thanks to method chain- ing  calling a method straight from the result of another one , we can produce mighty transformations in a concise way.    Function binding  what this refers to when the function actually runs  is an important issue often unknown to or misunderstood by web developers. Prototype provides a nifty bind    method that lets us not only guarantee context but also preﬁll arguments.    When it comes to function tricks, we’re actually well stocked. curry    provides partial application  preﬁlling part of the arguments of a function and producing a new function out of it ; defer    and delay    let us schedule the execution of a method call for later; ﬁnally, wrap   , argumentNames   , and methodize    open up a large ﬁeld of dynamic function analysis and usage.    Prototype now has excellent support for JSON, the JavaScript  Object Notation.

There’s More!”  At this point, you must be beginning to realize just how much improve- ment Prototype manages to pack into such a small library. Vastly im- proved strings and arrays, class-based element selection, properly bound functions, debug-oriented string representations. . . it is quite a feat, indeed. Yet there is much, much more to discover and marvel at. And the next step on this journey is about the new objects and modules Prototype brings to the mix.   By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems.  Alfred North Whitehead  Chapter 5 Advanced Collections with Enumerable  OK, this is it. This, dear reader, is the mother lode—one of the true cor- nerstones on which the power of Prototype is built. This is the module that provides many an object type with no less than 27 new methods, which address just about any common collection manipulation need, from ﬁltering to sorting to transforming to grouping to. . . .  This method set is, most important, mixed into Array; with Prototype, all your arrays have these new methods. Of course, anything easily con- vertible to an array  through $A   , such as DOM NodeLists, for instance  also gets the prize. With Prototype, arrays become this super collection type that features just about everything you need.  Many other types also mix Enumerable in, but you’ll use that aspect less often. I’ll make sure to remind you of this mixing in when we hit those types in later chapters.  5.1 The Core Method: Iterating with each  each iterator [, context]  → enumerable  At the heart of Enumerable lies each   , the fundamental iteration method. This is the one that actually relies on the host type providing an _each    method to implement the raw iteration algorithm  a techni- cal detail we’ll cover in Section 5.8, Which Objects Can Mix Enumerable In?, on page 105 . So, what is the added value of each   ?   THE CORE METHOD: ITERATING WITH EACH  89  Well, it takes care of all the extra ﬂuff:    It makes sure the iterator you pass gets invoked with two argu- ments: the current item and the current index in the iteration  starting at zero .    It handles the special $break exception your iterator may use to  short-circuit the iteration loop.  Indeed, whatever iterator you pass to each   , when invoked upon every iteration, gets not only the current item but also the numerical index for the current iteration  this lets you for instance, distinguish between ﬁrst item and later items . Just look at the following code:  Download prototype new enumerable_each.js     Alerts 'one', 'two', then 'three' ['one', 'two', 'three'].each function s  {  alert s ;  } ;     Alerts '0: hello' then '1: world' [ 'hello', 'world'].each function s, index  {  alert index + ': ' + s ;  }   We’ll get to the context parameter in a moment, but there are a few things I’d like to explain ﬁrst, which are generally more useful.  Short-Circuiting Enumerations With vanilla loop constructs  such as for or while , you can use two short-circuit instructions: continue skips the remainder of the loop body and goes over to the next iteration  if any , while break terminates the loop altogether. Such instructions, or their equivalents, are found in many languages  such as C C++, Java, C, and Delphi .  What seems to be a problem here is that we do not use vanilla loops; we use each   ! So, how can we obtain the same kind of functional- ity? Well, quite easily. We can skip the remainder of the current itera- tion by simply returning from the iterator function, using return as the Gods of Code intended us to use. However, there is no such straight- forward substitute for break. That is why Prototype introduces a spe- ciﬁc exception constant, named $break. Just throw it from your iterator, and each    will automatically catch it, cleanly terminate the loop, and return normally.   THE CORE METHOD: ITERATING WITH EACH  90  Whatever Happened to $continue?  Originally there were two exception constants related to iter- ation short-circuits: $break and $continue. However, the latter can be replaced by a simple return, which happens to yield much better performance.  This is why, starting with version 1.5.1, $continue got kicked out of Prototype. Use return instead!  Here’s a small code example for this:  Download prototype new enumerable_shortCircuits.js     This could be done better with an accumulator using inject, but humor me    here... var result = []; $R 1,10 .each function n  {  if  0 == n % 2   return; if  n > 6   throw $break; result.push n ;  } ;    result -> [1, 3, 5]  each Underlies Most Other Enumerable Methods Because each    is the fundamental iteration mechanism, it forms the basis of most other methods in Enumerable. Whatever need these ad- dress, they always need to iterate over some or all of the items in the collection. This means you can also use return and the $break exception in the iterators you pass to these methods  although you’d better know what you’re doing, because short-circuiting predeﬁned algorithms may yield results you hadn’t expected .  Currently, the only methods not relying on each    are eachSlice    and inGroupsOf   , which makes sense, considering their job is to work with groups of items instead of single items.  Enumeration Context Starting with Prototype 1.6, every Enumerable method has a new, ﬁnal context parameter. This was introduced in order to mimic JavaScript   GETTING GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COLLECTION  91  1.6+ behavior when necessary. This parameter is quite simply the bind- ing to be used for the execution of your iterator functions. If the iterator you pass is already bound  using bind    , this last argument is useless. But if your iterator function is not speciﬁcally bound, you can ask it to be by passing its bound object  the object to which this will refer within the iterator function  as the context argument to your Enumer- able method.  When the method you use is not provided directly by JavaScript 1.6+, it won’t be any faster than manually binding the iterator. It may be a tad more concise, though:  items.all function item  { ... }.bind obj      vs. items.all function item  { ... }, obj   When the method you use is a native one, using this argument will be much faster than manually binding the iterator  you’ll save the cost of the wrapper anonymous function created by bind   , at every turn of the loop .  I will not repeat this ﬁnal context argument on the signatures of each Enumerable method. That would be pretty verbose and likely to distract from each method’s speciﬁc purpose. Just know it’s there every time if you need it.  5.2 Getting General Information About Our Collection  The ﬁrst set of methods we’ll look at  each    doesn’t count. Come on. A one-method set?  is about quickly checking simple facts about our elements, including whether any or all of them suit our needs, whether an element is there, or how many elements there are:  all every  [iterator = Prototype.K]  → Boolean any some  [iterator = Prototype.K]  → Boolean include member value  → Boolean size   → Number  The all    and any    methods are more and more common in collec- tion libraries. In Mozilla browsers, native JavaScript arrays actually feature them already, although under the names every    and some   . They’re likely to be standardized in JavaScript 2.0  ECMAScript, 4th edition, due in 2007 . To help smooth over runtime differences, Proto- type includes aliases for them when needed, starting with version 1.6. But because we need to support $break for now, we override with our   GETTING GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COLLECTION  92  Joe Asks. . .  What Is This Prototype.K Thing?  It’s an identity function, which simply takes its ﬁrst argu- ment and returns it untouched. It’s very useful to Enumerable, because it lets most methods make the iterator argument optional. Either you pass in your own element processing or it will use the raw elements, without having to use two sepa- rate algorithms internally.  Prototype.K    is part of a few boilerplate functions described in Section 10.5, Boilerplate Functions, on page 238.  own versions for now. Anyway, these two methods let us verify that all, or at least one, of the elements satisfy a given condition, which we express in the iterator. The iterator function is then a predicate, that is, a function that returns a boolean information about its argument  for example, “no, this argument is not greater than 10” .  It is possible not to pass iterators to these two methods, in which case they use the elements themselves as booleans. If you are fuzzy on Java- Script boolean equivalence, here it is: null, undeﬁned, false, 0, NaN  Not a Number , and the empty string are all equivalent to false. Anything else is equivalent to true.  Here are a few example uses:  Download prototype new enumerable_quickChecks.js     Are there only numbers in there? [1, 2, 3, '4', 'hello'].all function item  {  return 'number' == typeof item;  }     -> false  ticks on '4', stops right there      Only higher percentiles? [92, 97, 90, 98].all function grade  { return grade >= 90; }     -> true  kick-ass class!   var nodes = $ 'topBar', 'menuBar', 'navBar', 'footer' ;    Found any of those? if  nodes.any       whatever...   FINDING ELEMENTS AND APPLYING FILTERS  93  Oh, and in case you’re wondering, both methods obviously stop iterat- ing internally as soon as possible: all    will not bother checking ahead once it encounters an item that fails the predicate, and any    is satisﬁed as soon as an item passes the test.  Then we have the aliased duo with include    and member   . As always with aliases, just pick whichever feels more natural to you. It’s all about your comfort. The names are self-explanatory anyway. They just let you know whether a given value is among the elements. It relies on lenient comparison  that is, using == instead of === , which can be surprising if you don’t pay attention to details. Finally, size    obviously returns the number of elements in the collection.  Here’s a ﬁnal series of example calls to get things straight:  Download prototype new enumerable_quickChecks.js  $R 1, 20 .include 12     -> true $R 1, 20 .include '20'     -> true  20 == '20'  $A document.childNodes .member document.body     -> false  not so fast, son!  $R 5, 20 .size      -> 16  5.3 Finding Elements and Applying Filters  One of the most common usage patterns over a collection of elements is ﬁnding stuff, or ﬁltering the contents to retain only the relevant items. In this area, Enumerable comes with a varied set of methods, catering to just about every common need:  detect find iterator  → firstElement  undefined filter findAll select iterator  → Array grep pattern [, iterator = Prototype.K]  → Array partition  [iterator = Prototype.K]  → [trueItems, falseItems] reject iterator  → Array  The ﬁnd    method  and its detect    alias  searches for the ﬁrst element that matches the criteria expressed by the iterator you provide. That is, it returns the ﬁrst element in the collection for which your iterator returns true. If no element lives up to the test, it doesn’t return any- thing, which means it returns undeﬁned.  If you’re interested in getting all the elements that match your iterator, use ﬁndAll     or its select    alias  instead. It returns an array of results,   FINDING ELEMENTS AND APPLYING FILTERS  94  which will be empty if no elements matched  I repeat: an empty array, not undeﬁned . These can be pretty plain to illustrate, so I threw in an optimal1 JavaScript prime detection, on the house:  Download prototype new enumerable_ﬁnders.js     An optimal naive-class  i.e. not requiring a Math Ph.D. and 50+ lines of    code  deterministic prime detection method, slightly compacted. function isPrime n  {  if  2 > n  return false; if  0 == n % 2  return  2 == n ; for  var index = 3; n   index > index; index += 2   if  0 == n % index  return false;  return true;  }    isPrime  $R 10,15 .find isPrime     -> 11  return s.length <= 3;  }     -> 'is'  ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'nice'].find function s  {  $R 1, 10 .findAll function n  { return 0 == n % 2; }     -> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]  ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'nice'].findAll function s  {  return s.length >= 5;  }     -> ['hello', 'world']  grep    is a rather specialized variant of ﬁndAll   . Before version 1.6, it matched the String representation of elements  the result of their toString    method  against a regular expression pattern. Since 1.6, it’s much more ﬂexible. It takes as a pattern  the ﬁrst argument  any object that has a match    method and uses this method on each item in turn. All elements for which match    returns true  or something equivalent to true  are returned.  This opens the door to a lot of power. Prototype extends RegExp, so it features a match    method equivalent to its native test    on the item’s toString    result, so we can use regular expressions, preserving back- ward compatibility.  1. Well, optimal in the naive class  essentially, a class of solutions not requiring a math PhD . If you’re geeky enough, check out the AKS primality test, for instance.   GROUPING ELEMENTS AND PASTING COLLECTIONS TOGETHER  95  But Selector  described in Section 7.3, Selector, on page 167 , also fea- tures a match    method that will check that the element you pass to it does match its CSS 3 selection. And naturally, you can create your own objects with custom match    logic.  Just like ﬁndAll   , it returns all the matching elements in an array.  You can pass an iterator if you need to get a derived value based on the elements, instead of the elements themselves. Note that this is about transforming the values being returned, not altering the string repre- sentation being matched against the pattern.  An example should drive the point home on this:  Download prototype new enumerable_grep.js     Get all strings with a repeated letter somewhere ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'cool'].grep   . \1      -> ['hello', 'cool']     Get all numbers ending with 0 or 5! $R 1,30 .grep  [05]$      -> [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]     Those, minus 1 $R 1,30 .grep  [05]$ , function n  { return n - 1; }     -> [4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29]  5.4 Grouping Elements and Pasting Collections Together  Sometimes, you want to cut collections into chunks, roughly equal- sized. Maybe you want to put them into multiple columns or some other stylish layout. Maybe you can pass only so many at a time to a backend processing layer  aaaah, those hard-coded, arbitrary limits in legacy software. . .  . Maybe you just feel like it. That’s what inGroupsOf    is for. As it was coded, it spawned eachSlice   , a nice group-based iterator.  Another grouping issue arises when you need to zip stuff together. Pic- ture the ﬂy on a pair of trousers: there’s the left side, the right side, and zip! They’re bound in pairs. Taking two collections and turning it into a collection of pairs is what zip    does:  eachSlice size [, iterator = Prototype.K]  → [ slice, ... ] inGroupsOf size [, ﬁller = null]  → [ group, ... ] zip sequence... [, iterator = Prototype.K]  → Array   GROUPING ELEMENTS AND PASTING COLLECTIONS TOGETHER  96  Don’t Waste Time: ﬁndAll vs. partition vs. reject  The reject    method does exactly the opposite of ﬁndAll     or select   , its alias . Instead of getting the elements that match the iterator, it gets those that do not. It’s fairly simple.  Often enough, your code needs to extract both sets: the selectees and the rejectees. The dummy way of doing this is to call the two methods in sequence. This will iterate twice, calling the iterator twice as much when a single pass could sufﬁce. So, the smart way in such a context lies with parti- tion   . It sorts out the elements in two arrays: those that pass the iterator and those that fail it. Then it returns those two sets wrapped in another array  remember that JavaScript, like most languages, lets you return only one thing at a time .  Note that partition    doesn’t require the iterator. Without it, it will use the elements’ boolean equivalence to sort them apart.  Here is an example using it:  Download prototype new enumerable_partition.js  ['hello', null, 42, false, true, , 17].partition      -> [['hello', 42, true, 17], [null, false, undefined]]  $R 1, 10 .partition function n  {  return 0 == n % 2;  }     -> [[2, 4, 6, 8, 10], [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]]  So, let’s play with inGroupsOf    for starters. It’s actually fairly simple. It takes the full list of elements we have and arranges them in ﬁxed- size groups. If there are not enough elements for the last group to be complete, it gets ﬁlled with either null or the second, optional argument. Naturally, groups are composed in iterating order.  This is actually a special case of generic grouping. You may well not want to ﬁll up the last group, or you may want to do something alto- gether different to the groups as they’re created, turning them into something else. This is why the actual slicing behavior resides in each- Slice   , which is then reused internally by inGroupsOf   . You pass the maximum size of each slice and an optional iterator that is used to transform each slice once they are all deﬁned.   GROUPING ELEMENTS AND PASTING COLLECTIONS TOGETHER  97  For instance, inGroupsOf    uses a simple iterator that ﬁlls the slice to size if needed and returns the updated slice.  I know, I know—that makes quite a few ideas to juggle around and pic- ture in your head. How about seeing some code? Let’s start by deﬁning a series of students, with their ﬁrst names  doesn’t “Élodie” feel lovely?  and ages:  Download prototype new enumerable_slicing.js  var students = [  { name: 'Sunny', age: 20 }, { name: 'Matt', age: 20 }, { name: 'Will', age: 21 }, { name: 'Julien', age: 22 }, { name: 'Thomas', age: 21 }, { name: 'Serpil', age: 22 }  { name: 'Audrey', age: 21 }, { name: 'Élodie', age: 26 }, { name: 'David', age: 23 },  ];  Then we get our ﬁrst eachSlice    out to produce groups of up to four students, with an iterator that will turn the original groups  arrays of student objects  into name-only groups  arrays of strings :  Download prototype new enumerable_slicing.js  students.eachSlice 4, function toon  {  return toon.pluck 'name' ;  }     -> [ ['Sunny', 'Audrey', 'Matt', 'Élodie'], ['Will', 'David', 'Julien', 'Thomas'],       ['Serpil'] ]  We could actually do this more efﬁciently by “plucking” the whole set and then grouping, but, hey, humor me. We’ll do that later with in- GroupsOf   , anyway.  Still with me? All right, on to the next one, which demonstrates a simple use with no iterator:  Download prototype new enumerable_slicing.js  students.eachSlice 2 .first      -> [{ name: 'Sunny', age: 20 }, { name: 'Audrey', age: 21 }]  Prototype.K    leaves the groups intact, and we call ﬁrst    on the resulting object to grab the ﬁrst group only. The result is unsurprising  even more than you think .  Now, here comes the mammoth.   GROUPING ELEMENTS AND PASTING COLLECTIONS TOGETHER  98  It actually does some heavy lifting here, so there is some code involved:  Download prototype new enumerable_slicing.js  Line 1  students.eachSlice 3, function toon  {  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  var maxAge = toon.max function s  { return s.age; } ; var leader = toon.findAll function s  { return s.age == maxAge }   .sortBy function s  { return s.name; } .last  ;  return { leader: leader.name, members: toon.pluck 'name' .sort   };  }     -> [ { leader: 'Audrey', members: ['Audrey', 'Matt', 'Sunny'] }, { leader: 'Élodie', members: ['David', 'Will', 'Élodie'] },       { leader: 'Serpil', members: ['Julien', 'Serpil', 'Thomas' ] } ]  We use eachSlice    on line 1 to break the students in threes and then proceed to turn arrays of student objects into something more struc- tured—an object with the name of the group leader and a list of the group members’ names. Most of the code in the iterator has to do with how to appoint the leader. I decided, quite arbitrarily, that the oldest student should lead, and if many students are at that age, the last one in alphabetical order should get the job.  So, we start by getting the maximum age on line 2 and then get the students in the group who are at that age  using ﬁndAll    at line 3 , and because there may be more than one, we sort the resulting array by name  here comes sortBy   , which we will describe later  and pick the last one. After that, it’s a matter of turning the original group descrip- tion into the new format we described in the previous paragraph.  We use pluck    again  described later  to restrict objects to a speciﬁc property of theirs and sort the result. Note that if Élodie ends up last in the members list of her group, it is because it’s actually a lexico- graphical sort  based on the order of characters in the Unicode table  instead of a localized sort  in French, Élodie would turn up between David and Will .  Agreed, after such a hard-core iterator, the illustration of inGroupsOf    is rather anticlimactic:  Download prototype new enumerable_slicing.js  Line 1  -  -  -  students.pluck 'name' .inGroupsOf 4  {    -> [ ['Sunny', 'Audrey', 'Matt', 'Élodie'],    ['Will', 'David', 'Julien', 'Thomas'], ['Serpil', null, null, null] ]      COMPUTING A DERIVED COLLECTION OR VALUE  99  Just note how it ﬁlls up the groups to a ﬁxed size, as opposed to a sim- ilar eachSlice    call, which we saw earlier. This makes it nicely suited to a variety of purposes, say, rendering elements into a full grid, such as a calendar.  What zip    does is another matter entirely. It takes one or more sequen- ces and creates tuples made of one element per sequence  starting with the one you’re invoking zip    on , walking the sequences in lockstep. When sequences passed in arguments are too short, we get undeﬁned at the proper position in the tuple.  This is useful in many cases. For instance, say we need to assign num- bers to items we have in a sequence:  Download prototype new enumerable_zip.js  $w 'Prototype script.aculo.us Dojo DWR' .zip $R 1, 4      -> [['Prototype', 1], ['script.aculo.us', 2], ['Dojo', 3], ['DWR', 4]]  The sequences in arguments can be longer than the one we’re calling zip    on. Extra items will simply be ignored. Now remember, from the syntax blocks earlier, that zip    can take an iterator, which will trans- form the original tuple into whatever we need. We might want to turn the framework rank tuples we just made into nice text:  Download prototype new enumerable_zip2.js  $w 'Prototype script.aculo.us Dojo DWR' .zip $R 1, 4 , function tuple  {  return tuple.reverse  .join '. ' ;  }     -> ['1. Prototype', '2. script.aculo.us', '3. Dojo', '4. DWR']  5.5 Computing a Derived Collection or Value  There are many ways to transform a collection into something else. We can compute a global value or turn each element into something else derived from it.  Computing a Global Value inject accumulator, iterator  → value  Injection is a pretty well-known mechanism in functional languages but is less famous in the mainstream. The idea is simple; we start with an initial value for the accumulator, then iterate over the collection, and, for each element, call the iterator with the current accumulator value, the current element, and the index  this last bit is mostly Prototype,   COMPUTING A DERIVED COLLECTION OR VALUE  100  since all iterations pass the index as the ﬁnal argument of the iterator . The iterator computes a new value for the iterator and returns it.  Since JavaScript passes object arguments by reference, you can use complex objects as accumulators whose state evolves across the iter- ation. For instance, you can ﬁll up an array like this, which is pretty frequent within Prototype itself. As an example, the ﬂatten    and uniq    methods added to Array are both implemented using inject    over an initially empty array, which accumulates values over time.  Injection is commonly used to create internal sums or products:  Download prototype new enumerable_inject1.js  $R 1,10 .inject 0, function acc, n  { return acc + n; }     -> 55  sum of 1 to 10   $R 2,5 .inject 1, function acc, n  { return acc * n; }     -> 120  factorial 5   However, we can use it, as I just said, to ﬁll up resultsets  usually expressed as arrays :  Download prototype new enumerable_inject2.js  ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'nice'].inject [],  function array, value, index  {  if  0 == index % 2   array.push value ;  return array;  }      -> ['hello', 'this', 'nice']     Note how we actually use references:  var array1 = []; var array2 = [1, 2, 3].inject array1, function array, value  {  array.push value * value ; return array;  } ; array2    -> [1, 4, 9] array1    -> [1, 4, 9] array2.push 16 ; array1    -> [1, 4, 9, 16]   COMPUTING A DERIVED COLLECTION OR VALUE  101  Turning Each Element into Something Else This is actually the most common case. Most beginners at Prototype often commit the venial sin of overusing each    instead of leveraging these tailor-made methods.  collect map iterator  → Array invoke methodName [, arg... ]  → Array pluck propertyName  → Array  The collect    method, and its more commonly used alias map   , let you turn each element into virtually anything! Here’s how it goes: each ele- ment is passed to your iterator, which computes the value being stored in the resultset instead of the original element.  Here are a couple examples, using both method names:  Download prototype new enumerable_collect.js  ['Hitch', "Hiker's", 'Guide', 'To', 'The', 'Galaxy'].collect   return s.charAt 0 .toUpperCase  ;  function s  {  } .join ''     -> 'HHGTTG'  $R 1,5 .map function n  {  return n * n;  }     -> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]  A common use case for collect    is to either call the same method on each element, with the same arguments, or get the same property for each element. Then we use either the method call result or the property value instead of the original element. These two use cases make up, together, a signiﬁcant share of collect   -like scenarios.  This is why Prototype provides two speciﬁc methods, which should be preferred over collect   . For the method-calling need, use invoke   . Just pass the name of the method and whichever arguments you would want it to get. Combined with the DOM extension mechanism, which equips all DOM elements with numerous cool methods, this is a potent tool. For the property-getting use case, go with pluck   , passing in the prop- erty name. pluck    has a gentle, delicate aura about it that ﬁts perfectly with the efﬁcient, minimalistic approach it takes, codewise, to perform- ing its task.   ORDER NOW: GETTING EXTREME VALUES AND USING CUSTOM SOR TS  102  Always Remember invoke and pluck  These two methods address two very common needs:    invoke    calls a speciﬁc method on each element and  returns an array of the results.    pluck    gets a speciﬁc property from each element and  returns an array of their values.  When you’re looking for one of these behaviors, you should forgo collect    and go with the speciﬁc method. I mean it. Why? Because not only does it make your code more con- cise and yet more readable, it also makes it more efﬁcient.  You see, collect    takes an iterator, which will then be invoked for each element, with the associated costs of func- tion call and lexical closure. On the other hand, pluck    and invoke    do not need such iterators, avoiding all these extra costs. It’s just better in all respects.  As always, examples help make it all click:  Download prototype new enumerable_invokePluck.js  ['hello', 'world', 'cool!'].invoke 'toUpperCase'     ['HELLO', 'WORLD', 'COOL!']  ['hello', 'world', 'cool!'].invoke 'substring', 0, 3     ['hel', 'wor', 'coo']     Of course, this works on Prototype extensions  why shouldn't it?!  $ 'navBar', 'adsBar', 'footer' .invoke 'hide'   ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'nice'].pluck 'length'     -> [5, 5, 4, 3, 4]  $$ '.cool' .pluck 'tagName' .sort  .uniq true     -> sorted list of unique canonical tag names for elements with this    specific CSS class...  5.6 Order Now: Getting Extreme Values and Using Custom Sorts  Naturally, Enumerable comes with a few methods about ordering and sorting:  max  [iterator = Prototype.K]  → value min  [iterator = Prototype.K]  → value sortBy iterator  → Array   ORDER NOW: GETTING EXTREME VALUES AND USING CUSTOM SOR TS  103  The names are self-explanatory. However, we need to shed some light on the semantics of these iterators. For min    and max   , passing an iterator lets you produce derived values on which to search for a mini- mum or maximum, instead of working on the raw elements.  You might, for instance, want to determine not the last string in lexi- cographical order, but the longest string. As for sortBy   , it requires an iterator, which computes a criterion value that is then used to sort the elements.  Here are examples of both methods, with both call modes:  Download prototype new enumerable_minMax.js  $R 1,10 .min      -> 1  ['hello', 'world', 'gizmo'].min      -> 'gizmo'  ['hello', 'world', 'gizmo'].max      -> 'world'  function Person name, age  {  this.name = name; this.age = age;  }  var john = new Person 'John', 20 ; var mark = new Person 'Mark', 35 ; var daisy = new Person 'Daisy', 22 ;  [john, mark, daisy].min function person  {  return person.age;  [john, mark, daisy].max function person  {  return person.age;  }     -> 20  }     -> 35  Note that Array natively features a sort    method, which can be passed a customized comparison function. So, you should use it, with no argu- ment, when sorting on the “natural order” of the elements  that is, when relying on the native < operator between two raw elements . If you need custom sorting, using sortBy    lets you compute just a criterion, instead of recoding a complete, overﬂow-proof comparison method:   TURNING OUR COLLECTION INTO AN ARRAY OR DEBUGGING STRING  104  Download prototype new enumerable_sortBy.js  ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'nice'].sortBy function s  {  return s.length;  }     -> 'is', 'this', 'nice', 'hello', 'world']  ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'cool'].sortBy function s  {  var md = s.match  [aeiouy] g ; return null == md ? 0 : md.length;    100% Prototypish: return  md  [] .length;  }     -> [ 'world', 'this', 'is', 'hello', 'cool']  sorted by vowel count   5.7 Turning Our Collection into an Array or Debugging String  We’re almost done with Enumerable. The last methods we shall see are those that let us turn an Enumerable into an array  with no element transformation  or into a debug-oriented string:  entries toArray   → Array inspect   → String  We already mentioned entries    earlier, explaining that it is the main reason why collect    accepts being called with no iterator. It is actually an alias over the more generic toArray    method. Recall that toArray    provides compatibility with the $A    utility function, as we saw in Sec- tion 3.5, $A, the Collection Uniﬁer, on page 47.  We also talked already about inspect    methods, which we introduced in Section 4.1, Introspecting Objects, on page 54. This version is rather generic and currently relies on its Array variant, surrounded by <Enu- merable: and >. Just wash it down with a few lines of code:  Download prototype new enumerable_converts.js  $R 1, 5 .toArray      -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  $R 1, 5 .inspect      -> ' '  5.8 Enumerable Is Actually a Module  So, this is a module. . . . If you remember what we explained in Sec- tion 2.4, Objects, Namespaces, and Modules, on page 37, this means Enumerable is not for direct instantiation; rather, it is supposed to be   ENUMERABLE IS ACTUALLY A MODULE  105  mixed in other object types, which are usually concrete types such as Array or Hash. From a technical standpoint, modules have no construc- tor function, so the new operator does not work with them. You will just get an error, something along the lines of “Enumerable is not a constructor.”  Which Objects Can Mix Enumerable In? Modules often make requirements on the objects they get mixed in, in order for the mix to work. Enumerable makes one speciﬁc demand on its “host objects”—that they provide the fundamental iteration mecha- nism through a method named _each   . It can be as simple as a vanilla numerical-index for loop  as it is for Array . Let your object feature this method, and it becomes, shall we say, “Enumerable-compatible.”  This _each    method will be passed a single argument, which is a call- back function. All it has to do is call it for each element in the iteration. Simple as Sunday  but not as SOAP .  As a real-world example, consider the implementation of _each    in Array  your favorite collection type :  for  var i = 0, length = this.length; i < length; i++   Download prototype new array_each.js  _each: function iterator  {  iterator this[i] ;  }  See? No big deal.  How to Mix Enumerable In? That’s easy. If your type was created using Class.create   , just use its addMethods    method with the module, like so:  YourObjectType.addMethods Enumerable ;  If it’s a more custom type, go like this:  Object.extend YourObjectType.prototype, Enumerable ;  Be sure to do so before adding your own methods to your object type in order to make sure you can override generic methods from Enumerable if need be  for instance, Array deﬁnes optimized versions of size    and toArray   , to name but two .  For further details on Object.extend   , go to Section 4.1, Cloning and Extending Objects, on page 56.   ENUMERABLE IS ACTUALLY A MODULE  106  What’s Enumerable Already? There are quite a few object types that mix Enumerable in, out of the box:    Ajax.Responders    Array    Hash    ObjectRange    Element.ClassNames  which is deprecated in 1.6, though   We mostly use Array, Hash, and ObjectRange, though.  What We Just Learned  Enumerable is quite something. Let’s quickly go through the salient points:    The core enumeration is each   , which relies on your enumer- able container’s own _each    implementation. All the more speciﬁc methods  for example, map    or inject     end up using each    to do their jobs.    To skip ahead to the next turn, just return from your iterator func-  tion. To short-circuit the enumeration, throw $break.    There is likely a predeﬁned method for just about every common  need you might have.    There’s often a way to squeeze more performance out of Enumer- able if you know it well. For instance, use pluck    or invoke    in- stead of the more generic map    whenever appropriate, or leverage partition    instead of calling both select    and reject   .    Method chaining  calling a method directly on the result of another method call  can quickly whip up complex processings in a rather concise way; however, because every call is an enumeration, you might sometimes turn out to run faster with fewer predeﬁned calls and a more advanced custom iterator. . . .    Although sortBy    looks more comfortable, it’s usually less efﬁcient  than sort    with a custom iterator.   ENUMERABLE IS ACTUALLY A MODULE  107  Neuron Workout  Think you got it all? Great! Then try this for size. . . .    Which is faster when iterating over an array, a standard integer- based for loop or each   ? Are there circumstances where one is preferable over the other?    If you must check that all elements in an Enumerable meet a con- dition that can be expressed both positively and negatively, is all    the best choice?    So, we’ve got items.max function i  { return i.size; } . Does it return the  item with the biggest size or the biggest size itself?    Use inject    to write a function that computes the product of all values of an array. Add your new function to the Array prototype.    Do it again in a more concise way by leveraging curry    as well.    Aside from strings with regular expressions and DOM elements with CSS selectors, what situations can you imagine where it would make sense to provide a match    method to become grep   - compatible?    Ignoring the slight structural difference of the resulting elements,  what’s faster: a.zip b .zip c  or a.zip b, c ? Why?  Pfew. There! We’re all done with Enumerable! That was quite a hand- ful. It is, indeed, one of the largest modules in Prototype. Time for lunch, dinner, a beer, or maybe just a nice cookie with a glass of milk. Suit yourself, and then come back and read ahead. The next chapter explores Prototype’s delicious API for uniﬁed event handling. Those bat- tling with Internet Explorer vs. W3C code will at long last ﬁnd peace.   Chapter 6 Uniﬁed Event Handling  This book is all about Prototype and script.aculo.us, the two libraries at the forefront of Web 2.0 application scripting the world over. We’re surrounded by JavaScript, and our pages must react to events coming from a variety of sources: DOM events resulting from user interaction with elements on the page, wake-up calls by timers, UI notiﬁcations from the browser itself, custom events triggered by library objects. . . . It’s an event-rich world our code lives in.  Until now, we could basically test whichever code sample was in this part of the book by simply opening a blank page in your browser that loaded Prototype, grabbing a JavaScript console  or better yet, Firebug’s console on Firefox , and typing away. That sure was handy and allowed for easy experimentation, irb style.1  But now, we’re going to get into more and more complex examples, which will require our code to react to events from many sources. To do that, we ﬁrst need to get familiar with event objects, including their nature, their origins, their behavior, and what we can do with them.  6.1 Event  The fundamental object here is Event. Depending on your browser, such an object may already exist. In that case, Prototype will merely expand it. Otherwise, it creates it from scratch. Event provides an entry point for using event-related methods and constants  although, as we’ll see, we can also access the key methods directly on DOM elements and documents .  1.  irb is a command-line tool that provides an interactive Ruby shell.   EVENT  109  Version 1.6 Changed Everything!  Prototype 1.6 was internally dubbed the “event overhaul” release. It brought about major changes in the API and pro- vided many new, exciting, powerful features. This chapter attempts to systematically point out when a feature or syn- tax was changed or appeared in this release.  Internet Explorer vs. the Rest of the World Events can be a pretty messy thing to play with, mostly because there is no uniﬁed support across major browsers. More speciﬁcally, there are two factions: Microsoft Internet Explorer, which just walks its own path, and everybody else, who follows W3C speciﬁcations. In this instance, the bible is DOM Level 2 Events.2 And on just about every aspect of dealing with events, Internet Explorer superbly ignores it and does things its own way  which must be a persisting itch to the six Microsoft experts who helped with the speciﬁcation, especially Chris Wilson, Mr. Internet Explorer .  Even Internet Explorer 7, with a fairly recent release, has not made an inch of progress on the JavaScript DOM front  or too little progress to warrant mention . It focused on “security” and catching up a bit on CSS, which is certainly good but won’t help us at all when it comes to event support and DOM manipulation.  Never fear, though, for you now use Prototype! And as you may have come to expect, it comes to the rescue in these areas, too.  Smooth Operator: A Uniﬁed Interface to Events Indeed, Prototype provides a uniﬁed way of dealing with events. In the following sections, I will mention, for each feature, three syntaxes: Pro- totype, the W3C, and Internet Explorer. This should help those of you who are familiar with the W3C’s or Internet Explorer’s ways understand exactly how to migrate your code, and it provides an informal conver- sion table.  2. http:  www.w3.org TR DOM-Level-2-Events events.html   EVENT  110  Registering an Event Listener    Prototype: $ elt .observe eventName, handler     W3C: elt.addEventListener eventName, handler, useCapture     Internet Explorer: elt.attachEvent onEventName, handler   Internet Explorer parts away from the W3C specs in that it does not use ofﬁcial event names  you need to use the on preﬁx  and does not sup- port capture-style propagation3  which is why Prototype now ignores that aspect too, because it’s not portable so far .  Unregistering an Event Listener    Prototype: $ elt .stopObserving [eventName[, handler]]     W3C: elt.removeEventListener eventName, handler, useCapture     Internet Explorer: elt.detachEvent onEventName, handler   We get the same kinds of differences we had on registration.  Stopping Event Propagation    Prototype: event.stopPropagation   or event.stop      W3C: event.stopPropagation      Internet Explorer: event.cancelBubble = true  Internet Explorer uses a custom property on the event object.  Preventing the Default Behavior    Prototype: event.preventDefault   or event.stop      W3C: event.preventDefault      Internet Explorer: event.returnValue = false  Internet Explorer uses another custom property on the event object.  If you’re unfamiliar with capture, don’t fret. I’ll explain the idea behind it in Sec- 3. tion 6.1, A Quick Primer on Event Propagation, on page 117. Still, Prototype ditched it with version 1.6, so it’s not that big of a deal.   EVENT  111  Grabbing the Source Element    Prototype: event.element      W3C: event.target    Internet Explorer: event.srcElement  Internet Explorer uses yet another custom property on the event object. Note that the Prototype version returns the extended form of the ele- ment  more on the extension in the next chapter  and also guarantees you get an element back  not, say, a text node .  Getting Details on the Event    Prototype: event.pointerX  , event.pointerY  , event.isLeftClick  . . .    W3C: event.clientX, event.clientY, event.button. . .    Internet Explorer: event.clientX, event.clientY, event.which. . .  Internet Explorer has some speciﬁc properties, mostly about mouse buttons and key codes.  Event-Related Methods Straight in the DOM  The three fundamental methods for event manipulation, observe   , stop- Observing   , and ﬁre   , do not need to be accessed through the Event namespace. As described in the syntax blocks of the previous sections, they are part of the DOM extensions Prototype performs for every ele- ment, plus the document object itself. See Section 7.2, Handling Events, on page 143 for details.  A Normalized Event Object  In the same spirit, Prototype 1.6 introduced event object normalization; most methods that used to be called from the Event namespace, such as element   , stop   , or isLeftClick   , can now be accessed directly on the event object passed to handlers. W3C methods that browsers such as Internet Explorer currently fail to provide  for example, stopPropaga- tion     are ﬁlled in when necessary. Finally, Prototype provides a few normalized properties  for example, target, relatedTarget, and pageX , as deﬁned by the W3C, based on what the browser natively deﬁnes. Such normalization has a trimming effect on Prototype’s code base and probably on yours, too! We will review and use them in the coming sections.  1.6  1.6   EVENT  112  The Art of Observing Events A lot of web developers these days are still using plenty of obtrusive JavaScript. That is, their HTML pages are laden with event-related attri- butes  think    or inline   elements. But you see, this is increasingly regarded as bad because this mixes content and behavior, which is generally not the best thing to do  although I should mention it may yield a performance boost in speciﬁc cases or make it easier to provide tooling for script-based features . It also leads to inconsistent behaviors when Internet Explorer calls handlers attached this way.  You may object that your page-creation tools are the culprits and that you just can’t make them do things in a better way. Well, ﬁrst, check your vendor for upgrades; unobtrusive JavaScript, which aims to put all  or at least most  scripting outside the content ﬁle  in separate Java- Script ﬁles , is quickly becoming the widely accepted best practice.  The clean scenario is like this:  1. The DOM of the page loads, creating elements in source docu- ment order—the   node, the   node, and at some point the   nodes—which immediately load and process your scripts.  Because the body of the page is not loaded yet, it is important to remember not to register event listeners on page elements yet. You’ll have to wait for phase 2, or at worst phase 3, in this sequence.  2. The DOM is fully loaded; all elements described by the document are created in memory. External resources may not yet be loaded  for example, images, CSS ﬁles, embedded objects , but their DOM elements exist. From this point on, you can register event listen- ers on them. Prototype 1.6 introduces a normalized DOMContent- Loaded event  originally a custom event from Mozilla  so you can react at this phase. Just use the custom dom:loaded event on the document object.4  1.6  3. The page is fully loaded; all external resources were loaded in and processed. That’s when the load event triggers on the win-  4. Due credit: the code is inspired by the excellent works of Dan Webb, Mathias Miller, Dean Edwards, and John Resig. As Isaac Newton would have said, we stand on the shoulders of giants. . . .   EVENT  113  dow object. If your page is heavy on external resources, this may happen quite some time after the page’s initial rendering. . . .  Events can start happening from phase 1  but they are not user-related events, which start more at phase 2 . Whenever an event happens, associated listeners get notiﬁed, and there is an event object repre- senting everything there is to know about the current event.  How can we get this event object? Well, the W3C spec mandates that all listeners get passed this event object as their ﬁrst argument. Natively, Internet Explorer does things differently if you’re using inline event attributes in your markup  but not if you’re attaching listeners through JavaScript . It doesn’t pass the event as argument but makes it avail- able through a global event object  technically available as the win- dow.event property, but that’s functionally equivalent to a global vari- able for your scripts .  Basic Scenario: Regular Functions as Listeners element.observe eventName, observer  → element element.stopObserving  [eventName [, observer] ]  → element  This is quite simple:  Download prototype events basic.js  function checkForm event  {  var form = event.element  ; var formOK = true;    Generic form checking code... if  !formOK   event.stop  ;  }  $ 'signUpForm' .observe 'submit', checkForm ;  If we were to remove this listener later  for some reason, this check is no longer necessary , we could do it simply with one line of code:  Download prototype events basic_unreg.js  $ 'signUpForm' .stopObserving 'submit', checkForm ;    Or $ 'signUpForm' .stopObserving 'submit'     Or $ 'signUpForm' .stopObserving    Easy as pie.  Note that two important things changed in version 1.6:  1.6    First, Prototype used to sport an extra, optional boolean argument on these two methods that let you request capturing instead of   EVENT  114  bubbling.5 Because Internet Explorer  including version 7  doesn’t support this, Prototype did away with the argument, which was misleading developers into thinking capture was emulated across browsers.    Second, you don’t need to provide the handler you registered any- more, or even the event name. Prototype will automatically unreg- ister any handlers matching the partial request. So if you just provide an event name, you’ll unregister all handlers for that event on this element. If you don’t provide anything  something like ele- ment.stopObserving   , you’ll unregister all handlers for this ele- ment, regardless of the event name.  Methods as Listeners: Careful with the Binding!  Before Prototype 1.6, event handlers did not get any automatic bind- ing when you registered them as listeners. They were subjected to JavaScript’s usual binding rules  which you can review at Section 4.2, Proper Function Binding, on page 58 . Starting with 1.6, event handlers 1.6 are automatically bound to the element they’re registered on. In other words, within an event handler, this always refers to the equivalent of W3C’s currentTarget property.  The thing is, your listeners are often methods that do rely on their containing object to perform their work. They need the this reference within these handlers to work properly. You may then be tempted to use bind   , as we saw in Section 4.2, Proper Function Binding, on page 58. This is not always enough, though. Just look at this:  Download prototype events methods_bind.js  var Displayer = {  intro: 'Received click event: ',  display: function e  {  alert this.intro + e ;  }  };  document.observe 'click', Displayer.display.bind Displayer  ; document.observe 'click', Displayer.display.bind Displayer, 42  ;  If you’re unfamiliar with them, check out Section 6.1, A Quick Primer on Event Propa-  5. gation, on page 117.   EVENT  115  Clicking will ﬁrst alert something like Received click event: [object MouseEvent], which is right and proper. Then it will alert something more like Received click event: 42.  Huh?! What happened to the event object in the second case? I said Prototype took care of passing it as the ﬁrst argument. . . . That’s right, but bind    will fail to pass this ﬁrst argument through if you provide speciﬁc arguments. They will be prepended, as usual. Let’s change our display    method to show its complete argument list:  Download prototype events methods_bind_list.js  var Displayer = {  intro: 'Received click event: ',  display: function   {  alert $A arguments .inspect   ;  }  };  }  };  document.observe 'click', Displayer.display.bind Displayer  ; document.observe 'click', Displayer.display.bind Displayer, 42  ;     Clicking on the doc will yield the two following alert strings    in Firefox:    1. "[[object MouseEvent]]"    2. "[42, [object MouseEvent]]"  This is the kind of use case in which we should use bindAsEventLis- tener   , which guarantees that the event object is ﬁrst, then puts what- ever arguments we provided it, and then adds the arguments passed when the event occurs. Here is our adapted code:  Download prototype events methods_bAEL.js  var Displayer = {  display: function   {  alert $A arguments .inspect   ;  document.observe 'click',  document.observe 'click',  Displayer.display.bindAsEventListener Displayer  ;  Displayer.display.bindAsEventListener Displayer, 42  ;     Clicking on the doc will yield the two following alert strings    in Firefox:    1. "[[object MouseEvent]]"    2. "[[object MouseEvent], 42]"   EVENT  116  OK, that’s better, but there is still another common pitfall that lies in ambush, ready to jump at your code and slice its throat when you least expect it. Consider this, where you decide to pass the handler argument to stopObserving   , for clarity’s sake, and do it the following way:  Download prototype events bound_stop.js  var Displayer = {  count: 0,  display: function e  {  if  ++this.count >= 3   document.stopObserving 'click', this.display.bind this  ;  alert 'Received click event: ' + e + '  ' + this.count + ' ' ;  }  };  }  };  document.observe 'click', Displayer.display.bind Displayer  ;  OK, run this, and then start clicking. Once, twice, a third time. . . . What happens on the fourth click? Damn! It still works! Did we fall victim to a fencepost error? Not so. We just called stopObserving    using a different listener from the one we had used when calling observe   . The thing is, to perform their magic, binding methods return a fresh anonymous method wrapping the original one. Every time you bind, you get a new method.  Depending on your situation, there are two solutions for this. If you want to unregister only that speciﬁc handler, you’ll need to cache it before registering and then use the cached version on the second call too, like so: Download prototype events bound_cached.js  var Displayer = {  count: 0,  _display: function e  {  if  ++this.count >= 3   document.stopObserving 'click', this.display ;  alert 'Received click event: ' + e + '  ' + this.count + ' ' ;  Displayer.display = Displayer._display.bind Displayer ;  document.observe 'click', Displayer.display ; On the other hand, if you can afford to unregister all handlers for this event on this element  say you got only one, which is the most common case , just do away with the second argument altogether.   EVENT  117  Note that if Displayer was not a singleton but an actual type, which could be instantiated, we wouldn’t have to deﬁne display    externally. For instance, here is a version using Prototype’s class deﬁnition scheme:  Download prototype events prototypish.js  var Displayer = Class.create {  count: 0,  initialize: function   {  this.display = this._display.bind this ;  _display: function e  {  if  ++this.count >= 3   document.stopObserving 'click', this.display ;  alert 'Received click event: ' + e + '  ' + this.count + ' ' ;  },  } } ;  document.observe 'click', new Displayer  .display ;  Listener Caching and Internet Explorer Memory Leaks  Every time you register an event listener, the description of this regis- tration  all the arguments you passed to observe     goes into a reposi- tory. The reason for this is that Internet Explorer has been known to exhibit serious memory leaks when event listeners are not explicitly detached. Prototype makes it easy on the web developer by automati- cally reacting to page unloading  an event that happens when the tab or window is closed  to go through this repository and automatically call stopObserving    for each previous registration. This is a sort of ad hoc, Internet Explorer–only garbage collector.  A Quick Primer on Event Propagation When an event ﬁres up, it is triggered on the elements that registered a listener for it. That sounds simple, but it’s incomplete and barely half the story anyway.  An event always remembers the actual element on which it happened. By “on,” I mean geographically on. Keyboard events obviously happen on whichever visual component currently has the focus  most often an input ﬁeld, but it could very well be a link, for instance , but mouse events are associated with whichever element was “on top”  appeared above any other  right under the mouse cursor. This is commonly re- ferred to as the source element.   EVENT  118          }  The W3C deﬁnes a target property for this, while Internet Explorer calls it srcElement  which, admittedly, is a rather ﬁtting name .  Event Bubbling  Once it is ﬁrst triggered, an event propagates. The default propagation mode, which is also the only one Internet Explorer supports,6 is called bubbling. The idea is simple: listeners relevant to the event are trig- gered from the source element outward. Consider the following HTML document body:  Download prototype events propagation_doc.html      Event propagation    There are essentially two propagation modes:     Bubbling : inside out    Capture : outside in  not supported by Internet  Explorer    Let’s now assume we have the following script in there:  Download prototype events bubbling.js  function showEvent e, reg  {  alert e.type + ' from ' + Event.element e .tagName + '  ' + reg + ' ' ;  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  document.observe 'click', showEvent.bindAsEventListener this, 'doc'  ; $ 'bubbler' .observe 'click', showEvent.bindAsEventListener this,  'bubbler'  ;  } ;  If you click anywhere but inside the ﬁrst list element, you’ll get only one message. For instance, click the background of the page, and you’ll get something like click from HTML  doc . Click in the territory of the second list element, and you’ll get click from LI  doc , and so on. Although you are not clicking the document itself  it’s not quite possible, because the whole surface is actually its child node, the HTML document node , the listener registered on the document gets invoked.  6. And can’t be cleanly emulated, which is why Prototype 1.6 dropped the related API elements.   EVENT  119  That’s one consequence of bubbling, and it’s very useful; it lets us deﬁne generic event listeners capable of dealing with the actual ele- ments the event was triggered on, which helps avoid code duplication  and sometimes helps reduce the amount of listeners you’re registering, which has a signiﬁcant positive impact on your page’s setup time .  Another important advantage of leveraging bubbling is that you can tweak the elements inside your container as much as you need, without having to re-register the handlers for them. You didn’t register previous handlers on the elements you’re replacing, removing, or adding to; you registered it on the container, which is still there and will be glad to grab the bubbling events originated from new or updated elements inside it.  Now click the ﬁrst list element. You get two messages. First you get something like click from LI  bubbler  and then click from LI  doc . The order in which you registered the listeners is irrelevant; it’s where you click that counts. The ﬁrst listener from the click target outward is the bubbler-registered one, and then the event bubbles up to the document level.  Note that you can stop this propagation at any level by calling the proper method on the event object. The uniﬁed Prototype way of doing this is event.stop  .  The event will simply not bubble up  it will also cancel its default behav- ior; if you don’t want it to, use event.stopPropagation    instead, which Prototype guarantees even on Internet Explorer . This is useful when your listener takes deﬁnitive action for the event and there is no need to let listeners higher up the document hierarchy pay attention to it.  Event Capture  Event capture is the second form propagation can take, and it lets you implement local censorship on events. Basically, whenever an event occurs, any listener registered in capture mode gets triggered in se- quence, from the outside inward. Any listener that stops propagation effectively censors the event; it gets trumped, shot, chopped to bits, seasoned, and thrown to the dogs your browser keeps in a small pen next to the garbage collector.  This can be a powerful tool  for example, to implement “glass panes” over the whole UI, which could be nice for fake modal dialog boxes ; alas, it is currently not supported by Internet Explorer, which essen- tially means nobody can risk using it on anything other than an intra-   EVENT  120  net web app where they control what browser is used. That’s why  again  Prototype 1.6 dropped support for it entirely, so as not to mis- lead developers into thinking it emulated such propagation on Internet Explorer. Some day perhaps. . . .  The Duality of event.stop event.stop   event.stopPropagation   event.preventDefault    There are two things you can do on an event that relate to what happens 1.6 next with it: you can stop its propagation, and you can prevent the browser from applying the default behavior for this event.  Many events have an associated default behavior. For instance, a sub- mit event on a form triggers submission  ahem  of the form. A click event on a link navigates to the link’s destination, and so on. Obviously, when you register a client-side form-checking method as a listener for a form’s submit event, you want to inhibit the default behavior if your checks fail. So-called smart pop-ups unobtrusively listen to their link’s click event to open it in a pop-up window, at which point navigation should not take place in the link’s window. The DOM Level 2 Events speciﬁcation endows event objects with a speciﬁc method for this: pre- ventDefault   . As we saw earlier, Internet Explorer doesn’t support it, but Prototype smooths that over and guarantees it’s there.  Because these two behaviors—stopping propagation and preventing de- fault behavior—are often indissociable, stop    does both. It calls the event’s stopPropagation    and preventDefault    methods. It’s a nifty little shortcut.  Getting Information About the Event There’s a whole world of information you might want to extract for the current event: what element it was triggered on, what the key being pressed or released was, what modiﬁer keys are active, what are the coordinates of the mouse cursor, and so on. Not all of this is easy to grab in a cross-browser way, but some of it is.  Getting Elements for the Event event.element   → HTMLElement event.findElement selector  → HTMLElement event.relatedTarget   EVENT  121  To get the source element, you can simply use Prototype’s element    function, passing it the event object. As of Prototype 1.5.1.1, it will make sure the returned element is extended, too.  The W3C-compliant currentTarget property is not normalized, because you don’t really need it. From version 1.6 on, your handler executes, by default, in the scope of the element you registered it on. this can be used in lieu of currentTarget. Let’s go back to our previous bubbling example. We have two click listeners, one registered at the document level and one at the ﬁrst list item’s level  the one with id="bubbler" . Say you click the  Bubbling  element. For both listeners, element    will return the   element. But this will return the ﬁrst list item for one and the document for the other.  However, most of the time you can get by with just retrieving, say, “the closest   ancestor of the source element.” This is a breeze with Pro- totype with the ﬁndElement    method:  Download prototype events ﬁndElement.js  function hideSurroundingParagraph e  {  e.stop  ; var p = e.findElement 'p' ; if  p   $ p .hide  ;  }  Starting with Prototype 1.5.1.1, this can take not just a simple tag name as its second argument but also a CSS selector expression just like what you’d use with Element.up     which is now used internally , so the whole panoply of Selector-supported syntaxes is available.  Prototype now normalizes the W3C target property, which is the node 1.6 that actually received the event, but you’ll usually go through event. element    instead to guard against the few odd cases where target would return a text node and make sure the returned element is extended.  Finally, Prototype 1.6 normalizes Mozilla’s custom relatedTarget prop- erty, which provides a secondary element for speciﬁc events, mostly the standard mouseover and mouseout events. When the primary element for these two are the element being entered and exited, respectively, relatedTarget works conversely. It provides, respectively, the element that was just exited or entered  entering an element usually means exiting another one, and conversely, at least from a visual standpoint .  1.6   EVENT  122  Mouse Information event.pointerX   → Number event.pointerY   → Number event.isLeftClick   → Boolean event.isMiddleClick   → Boolean event.isRightClick   → Boolean  Mouse coordinates are a complex thing. The ofﬁcial speciﬁcation for DOM Level 2 Mouse Events deﬁnes two sets of coordinates: client and screen. That’s fairly clear, but screen coordinates are mostly useless to the web app, and client ones  relative to the viewport  are far less useful than page coordinates  relative to the document itself, unaffected by scrolling .  Prototype provides two methods you can use, pointerX    and pointerY   , which do provide page coordinates. This makes nifty stuff like drag and drop or visual effects much easier to achieve. If you need client-based coordinates, the clientX and clientY properties of the event object are fairly portable.  Even something apparently as simple as the mouse button being pressed or released is tricky. W3C mandates a button property, theo- retically ranging from zero  left  to 2  right ,7 but Internet Explorer pro- vides a generic which property, whose button-related values range from 1 to 3. There are many other issues surrounding mouse click, such as different events being ﬁred for right-clicking and button emulation on single-button devices.  This quickly becomes a mess, so Prototype provides three methods: isLeftClick   , isMiddleClick   , and isRightClick   .  Keyboard Information  Finally, you may need to retrieve keyboard information about the event. Prototype provides a standardized set of keyboard codes through KEY_xxx constants in the Event namespace.  The easy part ﬁrst: looking up modiﬁer keys. Traditionally, we consider only Ctrl , Alt , and Shift  although some keyboards provide a Meta key, which might be mapped to the Windows key or the Esc key . The state of these modiﬁer keys can be rather reliably examined, whether on a mouse or a keyboard event, by using three event object properties: respectively ctrlKey, altKey, and shiftKey. These are booleans, set to true  7. Obviously, this is mirrored if the user’s mouse is conﬁgured for the left-handed.   EVENT  123  when the corresponding key is pressed. There is no portable way of determining laterality  all these keys usually exist on both sides of the keyboard , something DOM Level 3 Events will more than address with its future keyLocation ﬁeld.  Now for the tough part: determining which key was pressed. It depends on no less than three contextual parameters:    What your browser is  ouch!     Whether you’re after a character key  for example, A or 6   or not   for example, PageDown or Esc  .    Whether you’re listening to a key movement event  keydown or  keyup  or a character-producing event  keypress .  If you’re on Internet Explorer, are handling a key movement event, or are dealing with noncharacter keys, you’re going to look at the event object’s keyCode property, which holds the Unicode value for the key.  On the other hand, if you’re not on Internet Explorer, are handling a character-producing event, and are interested in character keys, you’ll look exclusively at the charCode property, which holds the Unicode value for the character. Both properties are never both set on the same event.  If you think carefully about this, there’s a lesson to be learned: never rely on keypress, because this opens the gate to a browser-compatibil- ity nightmare. Always use keydown and keyup, along with the event’s keyCode property. That’s portable.  Finally, here is the current set of keyCode constants provided by Pro- totype in the Event namespace: KEY_BACKSPACE, KEY_DELETE, KEY_DOWN, KEY_END, KEY_ESC, KEY_HOME, KEY_INSERT, KEY_LEFT, KEY_PAGEDOWN, KEY_PAGEUP, KEY_RETURN, KEY_RIGHT, KEY_TAB, and KEY_UP. This is by no means an exhaustive list  obviously! ; this is just a list compiled from the needs of Prototype and script.aculo.us over time.  As an interesting side note, know that the future DOM Level 3 Events speciﬁcation chooses a more generic way, equipping keyboard events with a keyIdentiﬁer property, which is a normative string identiﬁer for the key. The speciﬁcation, currently at the working draft level, deﬁnes a comprehensive set of 196 key identiﬁers.   EVENT  124  Firing Custom Events Prototype 1.6 introduces custom events, which are events with a name- spaced name  that is, a name with two components separated by a colon delimiter, as in widget:activated  that you can ﬁre on any DOM element, which bubble as regular DOM events and are equipped with the usual normalized properties and methods.  1.6  Prototype will soon bundle a series of built-in custom events to make several lifecycle maintenance tasks easier  for example, react to DOM fragments being updated or removed, react to drag and drops in better ways, and so on . So far, you can still use this facility for adding your own events to DOM elements.  element.fire eventName [, memo = { }]  → Event  To ﬁre a custom event on an element, simply call the ﬁre    method on it, possibly passing any data object you want to attach to the event  it will be accessible through the event object’s memo property . The event then triggers on the element and bubbles like any regular event. It is detected normally by registered observers, can be canceled, and so on.  To steal an example from the release notes, imagine you have a title element somewhere, and every time the title is changed, you’d like some visual behavior to happen  say, a highlight effect . You could deﬁne a custom event for this element  let’s call it title:changed  and register the proper listener for it.  Assuming the following XHTML fragment:       Release notes   ...     } ;  . . . we’d use the following code to register a listener for our custom event:  $ 'container' .observe 'title:changed', function event  {  this.highlight { duration: 0.5 } ;  As you can see, it is no different from our usual handlers. Now when some code, somewhere, changes that title  perhaps from a script in an Ajax response , it would just need to conclude its edit with the following line:  $ 'title' .fire 'title:changed' ;   THE EVENTS HALL OF FAME  125  That’s it! If we wanted to make the highlight duration controllable, we could handle an option in the event’s data object, something like this:  $ 'container' .observe 'title:changed', function event  {  this.highlight { duration: event.memo.duration  0.5 } ;  } ; ... $ 'title' .fire 'title:changed', { duration: 2 } ;  6.2 The Events Hall of Fame  Here are a few choice events you’ll very likely ﬁnd extremely useful in real-world web applications.  load Applicable mostly to window.  This triggers when the full contents of the document  including all external resources  are loaded. Often, though, this is a bit late for you to bind all required listeners to the DOM elements; you’ll want to use custom DOM-speciﬁc load events for this, such as Prototype’s custom dom:loaded event, described in Section 6.1, The Art of Observing Events, on page 112.  submit Applicable to  .  This is triggered when the user, or the script, attempts to submit a form, whatever the means  for example, hitting the Return key while in a form ﬁeld that does not capture it, clicking the submission button, or invoking the form element’s submit    method . The event’s source element is always the form itself. The default action submits the form: canceling it  for instance, because client-side checks of input data failed or because the form was quietly switched over to Ajax processing  pre- vents submission.  click Applicable to most elements.  This is a sequence of mousedown + mouseup that happened over the element on which the event was registered  the mouse might have moved in the meantime . This is not speciﬁc to the left  or, more accu- rately, “primary”  button. You can right-click or even middle-click. The   THE EVENTS HALL OF FAME  126  default action is usually clear  the most common case is the click over a link, which normally navigates to this link; smart pop-ups disable this after having ensured the link was opened in a pop-up window .  mousedown and mouseup Applicable to most elements.  A button of the mouse was pressed or released, respectively. A click will generate, in this order, the events mousedown, mouseup, and click.  mouseover, mousemove, and mouseout Applicable to most elements.  The mouse cursor entered, hovered on, and exited the element’s sur- face, respectively. Yes, mouseover is very poorly named. Remember that most “rollover” effects  that alter an element’s aspect while the mouse cursor is over it  can be more efﬁciently achieved through judicious use of CSS. Also remember that mouseover and mouseout can leverage Prototype’s guarantee for the event’s relatedTarget property.  keydown and keyup Applicable to most elements  through bubbling .  A key was pressed or released, respectively. This is where you use the event object’s keyCode property. A great many keystrokes have default behaviors that are often browser-dependent.  change Applicable to  ,  , and  .  This one is a bit peculiar. It’s supposed to trigger only when the element loses focus and its value changed since it last had gained the focus. This works pretty much that way on   and  , but things can be different for  , especially if it renders as a drop-down list  which is the default case, if you do not provide it with a size= attribute greater than 1 .  In this latter context, this event may well trigger whenever you change the selected value, either through the keyboard or through the mouse. Because of this, triggering large content changes  such as page reloads  on this event goes against accessibility, because people relying on the keyboard or assistive technologies might not be able to select a distant option in one pass.   6.3 Reacting to Form-Related Content Changes  REACTING TO FORM-RELATED CONTENT CHANGES  127  When working with Ajax, you often ﬁnd yourself monitoring the changes on a form ﬁeld or even the whole form. Whenever a ﬁeld value changes, you whip up some Ajax stuff in reaction.  It is in fact a frequent need, and Prototype caters to it through two tailor-made classes, aptly named Form.EventObserver and Form.Element. EventObserver  because of the aliasing of Form.Element, this latter class can also be used as Field.EventObserver .  Form.EventObserver new Form.EventObserver form, callback   This class lets you instantly react to any change-related event in a form that resulted in the form’s overall data  the values of all its ﬁelds  having changed. It will then invoke the callback method you provided when you created the observer, passing it two arguments: the form and its serialized data.  Change-related events are determined on a per-ﬁeld basis, as described in the next section. A Form.EventObserver essentially creates and man- ages Form.Element.EventObserver instances for all ﬁelds in the form at construction time. Note that this has an interesting consequence. Fields added dynamically to the form after the observer is created are not taken into account.  For details on how the data get serialized, see Section 8.3, Serializing Fields and Whole Forms, on page 179.  Form.Element.EventObserver new Form.Element.EventObserver field, callback   This second class lets you instantly react when a ﬁeld’s value changes  based on the click event for radio buttons and checkboxes and on the change event for other ﬁeld types . The callback then gets invoked with two arguments: the ﬁeld and its value. For further details on how the value is represented  this can get interesting on ﬁelds such as multiple-selection listboxes , see Section 8.3, Shape Shifters: The Changing Nature of Field Values, on page 178.   REACTING TO FORM-RELATED CONTENT CHANGES  128  What We Just Learned  Events are probably the most critical block of dynamic web apps, and Prototype has a lot to offer smoothing them out. The take-away points from this chapter are as follows:    The whole event machinery lies in the Event namespace.    The events world in web development is essentially split in two factions: on the one hand, Internet Explorer, and on the other hand, pretty much every other browser and the W3C. Prototype’s uniﬁed API lets us write code for both sides only once.    Prototype 1.6 overhauled the entire event system, addressing  many long-standing requests and wish lists.    All event objects are extended to feature the namespace’s methods  directly. You go e.stop   instead of Event.stop e , for instance.    The three key methods to manage behavior on elements and the  document itself are observe   , stopObserving   , and ﬁre   .    An event handler will run, by default, in the context of the element it was registered on  using observe    . It’s bound to it, and this will refer to that element. If the handler was already bound, it retains its original binding.    Event handlers are always passed the event object as their ﬁrst  argument.    In addition to regular browser and DOM events, Prototype lets you observe and ﬁre custom events, which among other things helps to decouple your scripts.    Prototype supports bubbling only, because it would not be able to  cleanly emulate capture on Internet Explorer.    The standard load event, on the window object, triggers late—only once all the resources in the page, including style sheets, images, Flash animations and scripts, have loaded. To quickly slap behav- ior onto your DOM, just wait for it to load  which is pretty fast  using the custom dom:loaded event on document.   REACTING TO FORM-RELATED CONTENT CHANGES  129  Neuron Workout  Here are a few puzzlers to help you digest these new skills:    Why do we need element    when our handler is bound to the ele-  ment we called observe    on?    What’s the better alternative to doing individual observe    calls  with the same handler on a series of similar elements?    So, we’ve got element   . Why do we need ﬁndElement    then? If it  weren’t there, how could we easily emulate it?    If we could use event capture in addition to bubbling, what sce-  narios would it be useful in?    Can you ﬁnd a use case where bindAsEventListener    is absolutely necessary  as in cannot be emulated in a reasonably concise way ?    What’s the best way to guarantee that a   won’t be submit-  ted to the server if our script decides it shouldn’t?   Chapter 7 Playing with the DOM Is Finally Fun!  When writing modern web applications, you ﬁnd yourself doing a lot of DOM manipulation. Traversing the DOM, fetching elements, show- ing and hiding them, replacing fragments of the document with new  X HTML contents, ﬁddling with CSS class names. . . this is what we web developers do.  Unfortunately, if we stick with the raw standards  such as DOM Level 2 , we ﬁnd ourselves tragically underequiped. The tools of the trade were judged and found wanting. It feels like building a skyscraper with cardboard and string.  But you’re using Prototype now.  True to its aim, Prototype comes with plenty of nifty tools you can use to tweak the DOM. At the heart of it is the notion of DOM extension. The idea is simple: one way or another, you can get “extended” versions of the original DOM nodes, and these versions are way easier to play with than their bare-bones counterparts. At the time of this writing, there are 45+ extension-provided methods in there.  7.1 Extending DOM Elements  Let’s ﬁrst focus on the net result for the web developer: fetching an element through the $    function  which we saw in Section 3.2, Quick Fetching of Smart Elements with $, on page 42  guarantees that what you get is the extended version of the original DOM element.   EXTENDING DOM ELEMENTS  131  An extended element is a DOM element that also features all the meth- ods we will see in the next section  plus extra ones if it’s a form or form ﬁeld element, as we’ll see in Chapter 8, Form Management, on page 173 . It is not a fresh object, distinct from the original DOM node. It’s the same node but augmented with Prototype’s extensions.  I could discourse for pages about Prototype’s extension mechanism, but this would be slightly beyond the scope of this book. So instead of entering into the nitty-gritty details of stuff like Element.Methods, Ele- ment.Methods.Simulated, or Element._attributeTranslations, let me answer the most common questions ﬁrst.  Speed Cost On browsers providing DOM element types with a prototype, the cost is close to zero. Prototype automatically extends the relevant prototypes at loading time, which is blazing fast. This is, most notably, the case of all Gecko-based browsers  and hence Firefox , Opera  at least from version 9 , Konqueror, and Safari  although speciﬁc versions of Safari may handle this in a speciﬁc way, the particulars are addressed by Prototype, and the speed cost is roughly identical .  For browsers with no such support  for example, Internet Explorer , the element is extended on the ﬂy the ﬁrst time it is requested as an extended element  either through the $    function or through a direct call to Element.extend   , which your own code should never need to do . Such an extension request can very well happen inside Prototype’s code, because numerous methods in Prototype return extended ele- ments. The element is then marked as extended, and there will be no further cost associated with requesting it as an extended element.  However, on-the-ﬂy element extension is not a trivial cost in itself, and when applied over a large number of elements  depending on your envi- ronment, this can be anywhere between 100 and 1,000 elements , the speed hit can be noticeable. So, you should refrain from needlessly relying on $     or other methods that guarantee extended results  when working with very large sets of elements. All extended methods can be called indirectly on “raw” elements  but because they will use $    over the element internally, what may have been raw before is now extended anyway. . .  .   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  132  What If These Methods Exist Natively? Simple as Sunday: they’re left as is. Prototype’s method extensions apply only when there is no native version present in order to maxi- mize execution speed.  7.2 Element, Your New Best Friend  Your gateway to DOM extension is the Element namespace. It contains the DOM extension machinery and the repositories for the extra meth- ods  mostly Element.Methods .  Calling the Methods All those methods can be used in two ways:    As vanilla functions, which can be passed any DOM element  in- cluding, most important, nonextended ones  as their ﬁrst argu- ment. The easiest way is to call them through the Element name- space, like this:    As methods over extended elements, which certainly feels more  like object-oriented programming:  Element.remove elt ; Element.next elt, 'li' ;  $ elt .remove  ; $ elt .next 'li' ;  All mutative methods return their original element extended. A muta- tive method alters the element in some way. Methods returning ele- ments  for example, fetching the descendant elements of the one passed as ﬁrst argument  return extended elements, too. This makes method chaining easy:  $ elt .next 'li' .remove  ;  Building a Staff Manager To get familiar with most methods provided through DOM extension, we’ll build a complete example that heavily relies on it. The idea is to have a simple web page that lets us describe people and groups of people. Groups can be nested to an arbitrary depth.  Our page lets us see the whole staff using a tree representation, on the left, and lets us create new groups and people, as well as rename existing ones, through a small editor zone next to the tree. Naturally, all   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  133  Figure 7.1: Our ﬁnished screen  groups in the tree can be collapsed and expanded. All nodes can also be checked using a plain checkbox. This opens the door to further use of the data  for example, we could use this to select to whom to send an e-mail .  The completed screen looks like Figure 7.1. Note that we provide a high- lighted representation of the selected node. To build this tool, we will need to follow several steps:  1. Create the HTML ﬁle for our screen. 2. Create a JavaScript representation of our data tree. 3. Write a function that takes the JavaScript representation of a per- son or group and inserts the corresponding DOM fragment in the document.   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  134  4. Handle clicks anywhere in the tree to deal with group togglers  those little + - signs that let us expand or collapse groups  but also select  or deselect  nodes.  5. Maintain editor state depending on the currently selected node  buttons may be disabled or enabled, information needs to be pre- ﬁlled when a node gets selected .  6. Handle uses of the form on the right in order to deal with node  creation, renaming, or removal.  Of course, we’ll do all this with the proper double take of polish, making sure the user experience is as smooth as possible and trying to leverage Prototype’s features as much as possible.  Because the primary goal of this chapter is to acquaint you with Proto- type’s DOM extensions, we will not add an extra layer of complexity by using Ajax to deal with server-side data. However, in a later chapter, we will come back to this example and turn it into an actual client server application, using Ajax for a snappy user experience. Data will not reside only as JavaScript objects on the client side but be stored on the server side. This will let us tinker away with form serialization methods and most Ajax-related utilities.  Laying the Groundwork: Our HTML Page The markup for our screen is fairly simple: a title, proper deﬁnition of charset, binding on the style sheets and scripts, and two zones  the tree and the editor form . Here you go:  Download prototype dom people.html  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">         Organizing your staff                 Organizing your staff       Your staff                ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  135      Item properties      Name:       <label for="chkIsGroup" id="lblIsGroup"  accesskey="G">Is a group?                <input type="button" id="btnRemove" value="Remove"  <input type="button" id="btnAddChild" value="Add as child"  accesskey="R"  >  accesskey="C"  >                   We use a   element in the tree because we’re going to put check- boxes in there and strict HTML mandates that form ﬁelds be located in forms  which rather makes sense . We also nest a   element because in our tree, all group-like levels  be it the root level, like here, or a regular group level  use a   to contain their children.  This is because we’re going to represent our tree with proper semantic markup: using nested lists. Since we have no speciﬁc ordering require- ments, we use   instead of  . Each item in such a list is a  , inside which all item contents  including sublists  are located.  The markup for our editor form is fairly short as well: a text ﬁeld, a checkbox, and three buttons  two regular ones that need to be speciﬁ- cally activated, which will trigger the removal of the currently selected element and the creation of a new node below this same element, re- spectively, and a submission button, which is activated whenever the user hits the Return key in the text ﬁeld or the checkbox in addition to plain old clicking. . .  . That submission button either creates an element at root level  when no element is selected  or renames the currently selected element. This makes for faster batch-oriented operation.

Let’s add some CSS magic:  Download prototype dom people.css  Line 1  body { font-family: sans-serif; font-size: small; } h1 { color: navy; font-size: x-large; font-weight: normal; } h2 {  color: green; font-size: larger; border-bottom: 1px solid green; margin: 0 0 0.5em;  } img { border: 0; }  tree {  15  props {  }  }  width: 25em; height: 30em; overflow: auto; float: left; border: 1px solid 444; background: eee; padding: 0.5em; cursor: default;  width: 25em; height: 10em; margin-left: 27em; border: 1px solid 444; background: eee; padding: 0.5em;  20  tree ul {  list-style-type: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;  } tree ul ul { padding-left: 1.3em; } tree li { padding-left: 0.1em; margin: 0.4em 0; } tree span { padding: 5px; }  25  span.group { font-weight: bold; }  30  tree span.person { font-weight: normal; margin-left: 16px; }  tree span.selected {  border: 1px solid 004; padding: 4px; background: ddf; color: navy;  35  }  - - editor p { position: relative; height: 1.3em; } - edtName, chkIsGroup { position: absolute; left: 4em; margin-left: 0; } - edtName { padding: 0 0.1em; right: 0; }  40 edtName:focus, edtName:active { border: 2px solid black;  background: ffd; }  lblIsGroup { position: absolute; left: 6.3em; }  Some of this is not immediately useful, because it relates to elements that will be created dynamically by script to represent tree nodes  those are the lines 24 to 35 . The rest is styling as usual. Our page is now ready for life to be breathed into it, thanks to scripting.   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  137  Representing the Staff: Our Staff Object We’ll put most of the functionality of staff management into a custom object, which we’ll call, quite simply, Staff. Inside it, we’ll put many methods, plus the actual data structure, tucked neatly in a nodes ﬁeld. It is an array of “tree nodes,” each of which is a simple object with at least two properties: id and name.  The id property matches the id= attribute of the   elements repre- senting the tree node in the screen and is of the form itemXXX , where XXX is an incrementally generated integer. The name property holds the tree node’s name, its visible label.  If a tree node is actually a group, it also features a children property, which is an array. Such an array holds tree node objects for anything inside the group, and so on and so forth, recursively.  Let us start by deﬁning a default tree with data for the staff of an imagi- nary company, ACME.1 This goes like this:  Download prototype dom fragments people_1.js  var Staff = {  nodes: [  { id: 'item1', name: 'ACME',  children: [  { id: 'item11', name: 'IT',  children: [  { id: 'item111', name: 'Sébastien Gruhier' }, { id: 'item112', name: 'Alexis Jaubert' }, { id: 'item113', name: 'Guillaume Réan' }  ] },  ] },  { id: 'item12', name: 'HR',  children: [  { id: 'item121', name: 'Sandrine Daspet' }  { id: 'item13', name: 'Xavier Borderie' }  ] },  ]  };    Staff  1. Boy, that’s groundbreaking.  Here we are: our staff is represented in Staff.nodes. The next step is to turn this data into actual tree nodes on the screen. . . .   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  138  Walking Around: Moving Across the DOM down  [selector = '*'] [, index = 0]  → HTMLElement firstDescendant   → HTMLElement next  [selector = '*'] [, index = 0]  → HTMLElement previous  [selector = '*'] [, index = 0]  → HTMLElement up  [selector = '*'] [, index = 0]  → HTMLElement  To build and manipulate DOM fragments based on this JavaScript data structure, we need to learn about two categories of methods in Element: those that let us walk the DOM easily and those that let us alter the contents of elements.  Bare-bones DOM walking is quite the nightmare: the properties pro- vided by the W3C speciﬁcation—ﬁrstChild, lastChild, childNodes, previous- Sibling, and nextSibling—work only at the node level, not at the element level. The immediate consequence of this low-level attitude is that we end up walking through empty text nodes produced by markup format- ting  for example, line breaks and indentation , comment nodes, entity references, and so forth. This is indeed unfortunate, because in the vast majority of cases, we concern ourselves only with elements. Not only that, but we usually want to reach for a speciﬁc kind of element  for example, a   or   element .  Prototype extends DOM elements with methods that let us do just that  it also lets us look at whole element chains in all directions, as we’ll see in Section 7.2, Meeting the Family: Ancestors, Children, Siblings. . . , on page 160 . These are named up   , down   , next   , and previous   , and all share they same signature:    With no argument, they get you to the closest element in their  direction.    With a string argument, they interpret it as a CSS selector, relying on the amazing capabilities of the Selector class, which we will explore in greater depth on page 167. A common form of selector in this context is a simple tag name.    With an integer argument, they get you to the indexth element in  their direction.    With two arguments, a string and an integer, they get you to the indexth element among those obtained by the selector, counting from the current element outward.  There is also an optimized method for a common use case, which just needs the ﬁrst child element, with no additional requirement. It’s cov- ered by ﬁrstDescendant   .   This makes for numerous possibilities, so let me illuminate this with a few examples. Let us assume the following document:  ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  139  Download prototype dom walking.html      Johnny Walker      Hey there      OK, so here I walk.   And walk again&8230;.           Here are a few calls and their results:  Download prototype dom walking.js     => list    => body  $ 'item1' .up   $ 'item1' .up 1  $ 'item1' .up  .previous      => title $ 'item1' .next      => item2    => undefined $ 'item1' .previous      => undefined $ 'item1' .down      => p2_1 $ 'item2' .down      => p2_1 $ 'list' .down 'p'  $ 'list' .down 'p', 1     => p2_2  Note that when no element is found, you get undeﬁned.  Replacing Contents and Removing Elements cleanWhitespace   → HTMLElement remove   → HTMLElement replace content  → HTMLElement update content  → HTMLElement  In order to create DOM fragments for our JavaScript “node” objects conveniently, we need another toolset focusing on altering the con- tents of DOM elements. When we limit ourselves with methods from the W3C DOM speciﬁcations, we need to build every tiny detail by hand, which is quickly cumbersome. True, script.aculo.us provides a Builder class, which can come in handy, but it can also be pretty verbose to use  although it’s far nicer than raw DOM manipulation, as we will see in Chapter 17, Building DOM Fragments the Easy Way: Builder, on page 343 .   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  140  What we have here are methods designed to work with multiple kinds of input for content:  An  X HTML text  You will most commonly have  X HTML fragments as fodder for insertion or replacement. More often than not, you’re getting them as responses from the server after an Ajax call. Their processing is described in the next section. Before version 1.6, only this form was acceptable.  An object featuring a toElement    method  The result of calling this method is used instead of the original object. Such a method must return a DOM element or fragment.  A DOM element or fragment  It is used directly.  An object featuring a toHTML    method  The result of calling this method is used as direct XHTML text would be. We actually rely internally on Object.toHTML   , as out- lined in Section 4.1, Miscellanea, on page 58, so if a code mistake ends up in passing something else, we get fallback behavior.  The fundamental methods are replace    and update   . The difference between the two is critical. replace    actually replaces the element you are calling it on, but update    replaces only its contents. For instance, consider the following DOM fragment:    This is an example    Here are two distinct calls and the resulting DOMs:  $ 'container' .update ' Don\'t cross the streams! ' ;    DOM:   Don't cross the streams!   $ 'container' .replace ' Don\'t cross the streams! ' ;    DOM:  Don't cross the streams!   Aside from these, we have a convenience remove    method, which sim- ply takes the element out of the DOM, and a cleanWhitespace    method, which scours the element’s DOM fragment to expunge any text node with only whitespace in it. This can be handy when you go from a HTML template with some indenting or line breaks and they end up messing with your styling.  OK, we’re all set to bring this JavaScript tree to visual life! Let’s ﬁrst add a method to our Staff object that does produce a DOM fragment for any given node. To do this, we’ll need to leverage the Template class we   will cover in Section 10.4, Templating Made Easy, on page 233, with two templates: one for the people and one for the groups:  ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  141  Download prototype dom fragments people_2.js  Line 1  var Staff = {  _templates: {  person: new Template   ' ' + ' ' + ' {name}  ' ,  group: new Template   ' ' + ' ' + '  ' + ' ' + ' {name}  ' + '  '   5  10  15  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  25  },  nodes: [    ...  ],  20  createDOMFragment: function parentId, node  {  var element = $ document.createElement 'li'  ; element.id = node.id; var tpl = this._templates[node.children ? 'group' : 'person']; var escapedNode = { id: node.id, name: node.name.escapeHTML   }; element.update tpl.evaluate escapedNode  ; $ parentId .down 'ul' .appendChild element ; element.down 'input' .checked = node.checked; return node;  }  30  };    Staff  We start by putting two Template objects in a “private” ﬁeld  as the initial underscore convention implies . Both these fragments are intended to be the whole initial contents of the   element for our new tree node. Note the embedded   around the name part, which will make it easier for us to rename the node later. We are going to create the   element the regular way and use update    on it to ﬁll it in.  That “regular” way appears in createDOMFragment   , on line 20. It’s a simple document.createElement 'li' . We wrap it in a $    call to make sure we get the extended version of the element.  Then we start leveraging the magic of Prototype:  1. Line 23 selects the appropriate Template object, depending on the node’s nature. We already saw that a node representing a group   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  142  features a children property, which will otherwise be undeﬁned  thereby boolean-equivalent to false .  2. On line 24, we produce a template-oriented version of the node, with just id and label, this latter ﬁeld being HTML-escaped to pre- vent markup injection.  3. We can then evaluate the template around this object, on line 25, and inject the resulting HTML into the newly created   element. Notice it doesn’t have to be present in the whole page’s DOM at this point.  4. A little more walking lets us grab the parent node  which is either a   element or the root   , walk down to ﬁnd its child- containing  , and add our DOM fragment as its last child  that is, at the end of its existing contents .  5. Time for a walk: we need to update the status of the checkbox in the node, depending on the presence  and value  of a checked property in the JavaScript node, which is what we do on line 27. So far, none of our default nodes features such a property, which is equivalent to featuring one with a value of false. So, all our check- boxes here will be unchecked for the basic tree.  I’ll bet you’re dying to try this out, so let’s add another little method, speciﬁcally designed to initialize our view with the default state of our nodes ﬁeld:  Download prototype dom fragments people_3.js  Line 1  var Staff = {     ...     ...  },  createDOMFragment: function parentId, node  {  init: function id, nodes  {  id = id  'staff'; nodes = nodes  this.nodes; nodes.each function n  {  n.container = nodes; this.createDOMFragment id, n ; if  n.children   this.init n.id, n.children ;  }.bind this  ;  }  };    Staff  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  143  The new init    method recursively injects our default node tree into our web page. There are a couple things to look at here:    Notice the  idiom at the beginning of the init    function  from line 9 . It’s a common way to provide default values for arguments where a false-equivalent value is invalid.2 Either there is a valid value passed or the argument is missing, and we use the operand on the right as its value. These two lines make sure that calling init    with no arguments will start working at the root level of the tree  staff is the id= of our  , remember? , both in the view and in our JavaScript structure.    You may be intrigued by this container property we’re tweaking on line 12. This is because we want to make sure all JavaScript nodes keep a reference on their container node. We’ll need that to properly handle node removal.    There’s also an important line here. Line 16 contains a call to bind   . Without it, our anonymous function would be unbound and could not ﬁnd its methods  it uses this.createDOMFragments and this.init . Explicitly binding it to our this avoids such nasty surprises.  Rubber, meet road: save it all, refresh your web page in your browser of choice, ﬁre up a JavaScript console  or better yet in Firefox, use Firebug’s console , and try it:  ⇐ Staff.init    If you got it all right, you should see the whole tree appear as if by magic! Figure 7.2, on the next page, illustrates this.  Handling Events observe eventName, handler  → HTMLElement stopObserving  [eventName [, handler] ]  → HTMLElement  Well, our little staff project is moving along nicely. Still, that manual JavaScript call will not cut it with the HR people, I’m afraid.  We would need to make it automatically happen once the page is ready. And as long as we’re binding event listeners here, now that we are equipped with the knowledge to create DOM fragments based on our JavaScript nodes, we could deal with form submission  as well as this Remove button, too .  2. Remember that zero is false-equivalent. If it’s acceptable as an argument, you can’t rely on this idiom.   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  144  Figure 7.2: Manually injecting our initial tree  So, let’s start by equipping our Staff object with two methods to create a new node or rename the currently selected one and some ID-generating machinery. We also need to keep track of the currently selected node. For now, we have no way to select a node, but when we do, creating a node will add it as a child to the selected one.  Download prototype dom fragments people_4.js  var Staff = {     _templates...  _currentId: 1000,  selected: null,   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  145     nodes...  create: function name, isGroup  {  var container = this.selected ? this.selected.children : this.nodes; var node = { id: 'item' + this.genId  , name: name,  this.selected ? this.selected.id : 'staff', node ;  container: container };  if  isGroup   node.children = []; container.push node ; return this.createDOMFragment   },  },  },     createDOMFragment...  genId: function   {  return ++this._currentId;  init: function   {     ...  update: function   {  this.selected.label = $F 'edtName' ; $ this.selected.id .down 'span', 1 .update   this.selected.label.escapeHTML   ;  }  };    Staff  The create    code is quite simple. First, we determine what’s the con- tainer for our new JavaScript node: either the root one or the selected node’s children property  if we’re creating a group, we also need to pro- vide it with its own children container . Then, we create the node simply by initializing it as an anonymous object. ID generation is delegated to a tiny genId    routine in case we need to refactor it at some point. Finally, once the node is created and added to its container, we reuse our beloved createDOMFragment    to add it, either below the selected node or at the root level.  Update is much simpler, because we are just renaming the currently selected node  we decided not to let a person node become a group node or the other way around . The $F    function will give us the text ﬁeld’s value, which we can use to update the JavaScript node. Then, all that is left to do is update the contents of the name-wrapping  , which is the second, in document order, inside the   element  recall indices in DOM-walking methods start at zero .   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  146  Well, the data model is ready. Now let’s bind this to our view:  Download prototype dom fragments people_5.js     Staff...  function processForm e, addChild  {  e.stop  ; if  Staff.selected && !addChild   Staff.update $F 'edtName'  ;  else  }    processForm  Staff.create $F 'edtName' , $ 'chkIsGroup' .checked ;  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  Staff.init  ; $ 'editor' .observe 'submit', processForm ; $ 'btnAddChild' .observe 'click',  processForm.bindAsEventListener this, true  ;  } ;  There are a few items of interest in this code. The idea is that process- Form    deals with both the submission button and the Add as child button. How to differentiate? We could use the event’s source element and check its ID, but I thought this was a nice way to introduce a real-world example of bindAsEventListener   .  Here’s the deal: when the submission button is clicked, processForm    gets invoked with only its event object as an argument  this is auto- matically provided . Its addChild argument is undeﬁned and therefore is equivalent to false. This submission button is intended to always be available  except when the text ﬁeld is empty, but we’ll get to that in due time .  On the other hand, when the Add as child button is clicked, process- Form    gets invoked with its event argument and a second argument  in our case, addChild set to true . This is what bindAsEventListener    is for, my friend.  So, we end up with the following use cases:    No selected element: branching on else, creating a new element   which will, then, be added at the root level of the tree     Selected element, regular submission button  which we will soon make sure then reads Rename : branching on if, updating the ele- ment  which, as we saw, is just a renaming indeed     Selected element, Add as child button: branching on else, creating  a new element  which will appear below the selected one    ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  147  Also note that we triggered the default tree injection, too. This whole event registration business happens when the page is loaded so as to make sure we have the whole basic DOM available to us and can bind event handlers without problems.  To move ahead, we need to be able to select elements, which requires us to dynamically alter the CSS class name set of elements. From then on, we’ll be able to adjust the form’s look and behavior depending on the selection state, and we’ll also be ready to implement element removal.  Tweaking CSS Class Names addClassName className  → HTMLElement hasClassName className  → Boolean removeClassName className  → HTMLElement toggleClassName className  → HTMLElement  It’s really no big deal, or so it seems—the set of CSS classes pertain- ing to an element is stored as a whitespace-separated list in its class= attribute, which is accessible through its className property in Java- Script.  The trick is that since it’s a string concatenation and not some form of container, we keep having to pull some string-fu to work with it. That is why Prototype provides these tricks for you.3  The names are self-explanatory: addClassName    makes sure a given class name is in the set  without hurting any existing class name in there , removeClassName    makes sure it gets out, hasClassName    tests whether it’s in, and toggleClassName    removes it if it’s there or adds it if it’s missing.  Knowing this, we can start dealing with clicks on our tree zone. Creating an individual handler for all items in there would be wasteful. We can leverage event bubbling and attach only one handler at the tree level, which will get all click events happening somewhere in it. However, we need to be careful about which clicks we’re talking about:    Clicks on checkboxes are left for the browser to deal with  they will  toggle the checkbox status . We’re not interfering with this.  3. Until version 1.6, it used to rely internally on a tiny Element.ClassNames class, which made for a rather heavy-handed execution of these CSS manipulations. It’s now depre- cated, along with the classNames    method, and these manipulations are implemented with optimized string manipulation.   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  148    Clicks on the links surrounding the toggler images  which are, incidentally, the only links in the tree  will, later, actually toggle the relevant group’s visibility. We don’t know everything we have to know just yet in order to do that.    Clicks anywhere else must fall either below the actual tree or somewhere in the screen space of a   element that represents an item. We then need to select this item.  This makes for quite a few code additions:  Download prototype dom fragments people_6.js  Line 1  var Staff = {     templates, nodes, createDOMFragment...  find: function id, nodes  {  nodes = nodes  this.nodes; var result; nodes.each function n  {  result = n.id == id ? n : n.children && this.find id, n.children ; if  result   5  10  25  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  throw $break;  }.bind this  ; return result;  },  15     genId, init...  select: function id  {  if  this.selected   } this.updateEditor  ; return this.selected;  },  },  30  update: function   {     ...  updateEditor: function   {  35  if  !this.selected  {  $ 'edtName' .value = ''; $ 'chkIsGroup' .enable  .checked = false; $ 'btnSubmit' .value = 'Create';  $ this.selected.id .down 'span' .removeClassName 'selected' ;  20  this.selected =  this.selected && this.selected.id == id  ? null : this.find id  ;  if  this.selected  {  var elt = $ id ; elt.down 'span' .addClassName 'selected' ;   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  149  $ 'btnRemove', 'btnAddChild', 'btnSubmit' .invoke 'disable' ;  40  } else {  45  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  $ 'edtName' .value = this.selected.name; var isGroup = this.selected.children; $ 'chkIsGroup' .checked = isGroup; $ 'btnSubmit' .value = 'Rename'; $ 'btnRemove' .enable  ; $ 'btnAddChild', 'chkIsGroup' .invoke   isGroup ? 'enable' : 'disable' ;  } $ 'edtName' .activate  ;  50  }  };    Staff  Finding a JavaScript node in our custom-made JavaScript tree is going to be a recurrent need. We address it with a ﬁnd    method  starting on line 4 , which recursively browses our data structure and returns either a node object or undeﬁned. It’s intended to be called with a simple ID.  Visually selecting a node requires us to do two things, so look at the code for select   , starting on line 17. We start by catering to the current selection, if any. We need to deselect it. This just means we’ll remove selected from its CSS class name set. Then, we can ﬁnd the JavaScript node for the new selection, assign it to the selected ﬁeld, add selected to its classes, and update the state of the editor form on the right to reﬂect the new state of things.  The condition over calling ﬁnd    provides a nice extra touch—clicking the current selection simply deselects it. This lets us add new nodes at root level any time, which is nice.  The updateEditor    function is pretty straightforward, although slightly bulky. If there is no selected node, we reset the form and disable all buttons  this is because the Add as child button would be redundant over Create, and this latter one will have to wait for the user to type a valid name in order to become enabled . On the other hand, a selected node will see its name and group quality reﬂected in the form; the sub- mit button will be labeled Rename, and Remove will become enabled, as will Add as child if the selection is a group node. Note, however, that if the selection is a person node, it should not be possible to make it become a group, and we cannot add a group node as a child to it. Therefore, we disable the checkbox.  That’s it for the staff logic, but we need to listen for clicks in the tree area now. That’s what we do with the following handler, attached at page-loading time, as usual:   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  150  5  10  15  25  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  Download prototype dom fragments people_7.js  Line 1  function handleTreeClick e  {  var elt = e.element  ; if  elt.tagName == 'INPUT'   return; e.stop  ; if  elt.tagName == 'IMG'   elt = elt.up 'a' ;  if  elt.tagName == 'A'  {     Some toggle code, coming soon! return;  }    Other click. if  'LI' != elt.tagName   elt = elt.up 'li' ;  if  !elt  return;  Staff.select elt.id ;  }    handleTreeClick  20     processForm...  Let's select if we're on a valid item!  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  Staff.init  ; Staff.updateEditor  ; $ 'tree' .observe 'click', handleTreeClick ; $ 'editor' .observe 'submit', processForm ; $ 'btnAddChild' .observe 'click',  processForm.bindAsEventListener this, true  ; new Field.Observer 'edtName', 0.3, function   {  30  $ 'btnSubmit' .disabled = $F 'edtName' .blank  ;  } ;  } ;  We use the event’s element    method to know on what element the click occurred, wrapping it in a $    call to get the sweet candy of DOM exten- sions. Clicking checkboxes should be left alone. We let go of INPUT - related clicks. Otherwise, this click is ours to deal with. We start by stopping the event so it won’t bubble up and trigger further handlers.  If we clicked toggler images, we’ll just go up the DOM toward their con- taining link. We can then deal with such clicks in a uniform manner  which will be detailed later, when we have learned enough about play- ing with elements’ visibility . Any other target element means we clicked either somewhere nonspecial in a tree node  that is, in a   element’s area  or outside any tree node  for example, empty space in the tree area . This is what the tests from line 13 take care of.   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  151  Eventually, if we reach the method’s ﬁnal line, we’re on a valid item. We need to select it, which we delegate to our dear Staff.select   . Binding these event handlers requires a few extra lines in our page-load setup code. First, note we make sure our editor form starts out in a state consistent with our policy by calling Staff.updateEditor   up front. We then go ahead and bind our handler to click events in the tree zone.  As a ﬁnal touch  remember how I mentioned polish? , we’re going to leverage a small tool that we’ll better explore later, Field.Observer, start- ing on line 29. This lets us watch out for changes of value in a given form ﬁeld at regular intervals. We decide to keep an eye on the text ﬁeld and adjust the submission button’s state  enabled or disabled  based on it. If the value is blank  that is, if it contains only whitespace or is actually empty , the submission button is disabled. That’s a simple UI rule: never let your users believe they can activate something only to tell them “no” when they do. To be responsive enough to typing, without hogging the browser with our checking, we go for a 0.3" interval; check- ing on the name three times a second sounds good enough, doesn’t it?  OK, there you go: node selection, form maintenance, node creation, and node renaming! This is great, but removal sort of screams to be implemented here; can’t you hear? And indeed, now that selection is implemented, there’s no reason not to answer its plea. So off we go:  Download prototype dom fragments people_8.js  var Staff = {     everything up to init...  removeSelected: function   {  if  !this.selected   throw 'No selection to remove';  var container = this.selected.container; container = container.without this.selected ; var elt = $ this.selected.id ; var previous = elt.previous 'li' ; if  !previous   previous = elt.up 'li' ;  elt.remove  ; this.selected = null; if  previous   this.select previous.id ;  else  },  this.updateEditor  ;     select, update...  };    Staff   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  152     ...  } ;  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {     ... $ 'btnRemove' .observe 'click', Staff.removeSelected.bind Staff  ;    ...  Our new Staff method, removeSelected   , needs no argument. It can grab the selected node from the selected ﬁeld. Because it relies on a proper this reference, we must remember to properly bind it when mak- ing it an event listener. Because it doesn’t care for the event object as its ﬁrst argument, a simple bind    is sufﬁcient.  This is where the few lines we added earlier to maintain a container property in all JavaScript nodes pay off. Thanks to that, we can update the container  it is the array containing our node  to avoid stray ref- erences that would wreak havoc in our application’s behavior. Then there’s some boilerplate algorithm to determine which element to select after the removal. It has to be the previous one, in a previous-and-up traversal. The usual stuff. Let’s not forget to reset the selection at the proper moment and to update the editor explicitly if there was no new selection.  Well, my friend, that’s some meaty JavaScript already! All that’s left is the group toggling, letting us collapse and expand the group nodes in our tree. This is actually a rather light task, but to tackle it, we need to learn about playing with elements’ visibility.  Peek-a-Boo: Hiding, Showing, and Checking Visibility hide   → HTMLElement show   → HTMLElement toggle   → HTMLElement visible   → Boolean  Prototype provides elements with four methods to deal with their vis- ibility. More exactly, these methods deal with the CSS display prop- erty. Hiding an element means setting this property to none. Showing it again is achieved by restoring the property to whatever it was before that. When dealing with these methods, you can be in one of two sit- uations. If your element is in the normal ﬂow and is visible, you don’t have anything extra to do. However, if you plan on hiding an element that uses a speciﬁc value for its display property or if you need to hide the element from the start, you must specify the original property value in an inline style  a style= attribute on the HTML element .   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  153  Joe Asks. . .  display? Is That All You’re Looking At?!  Simply relying on the CSS display property can indeed seem sloppy. After all, for an element to actually be visible, a num- ber of things need to be veriﬁed—not only display but also visibility, positioning, opacity, overﬂow control, and all of this recursively through the container chain. . . .  You get the idea: it’s a ﬂippin’ nightmare! To obtain an authoritative answer on whether our element is, indeed, vis- ible, we would have to come up with some serious Java- Script DOM mojo, which would be incredibly complex and likely inefﬁcient, not to mention how we would have to battle against browser compatibility.  So yes, like many other libraries, Prototype checks only on display. And believe it or not, that’s actually enough for most cases. Plus, that’s super fast.  Yes, this is an intrusion of appearance in contents. This is a breach of the separation of concerns. This is lame. Yes. But this is a necessary evil, because there currently is no reliable, cross-browser way to grab the property’s speciﬁed value, if it is not speciﬁed inline.  This is an issue most Prototype and script.aculo.us beginners stumble upon. If your element has anything other than the default value for its display property and you plan to use hide show methods or effects on it, you must set its CSS display property through an inline style= attribute. Repeat after me: inline attribute. Let it sink in.  So, now that we know this, we can complete our staff management example application. It only needs its toggling capability to be wrapped up; let’s get on with it:  Download prototype dom fragments people_9.js  Line 1  var Staff = {     ...  -  -  -  5  -  createDOMFragment: function parentId, node  {     ... element.down 'input' .checked = node.checked;   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  154  },  },  },  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  50  this.makeVisible node.id ; return node;     find, genId, init  makeVisible: function id  {  var elt = $ id ;    Open all containing groups while  elt = elt.up 'ul'    if  !elt.visible     this.toggle elt.up 'li' .id ;     removeSelected  select: function id  {     ... if  this.selected  {  }    ...  },  var elt = $ id ; elt.down 'span' .addClassName 'selected' ; this.makeVisible id ;  toggle: function id  {  var elt = $ id ; var group = elt.down 'ul' ; var toggler = elt.down 'img' ; var groupIsVisible = group.toggle  .visible  ; toggler.src = 'group_' +  groupIsVisible ? 'open' : 'closed'  +  '.gif';  toggler.alt =  groupIsVisible ? '-' : '+' ; toggler.up 'a' .title = 'Click to ' +   groupIsVisible ? 'collapse' : 'expand' ;  45     update, updateEditor  };    Staff  function handleTreeClick e  {     ... if  elt.tagName == 'A'  {  Staff.toggle elt.up 'li' .id ; return;  55  }    handleTreeClick  }    ...     ...   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  155  Let’s start with the toggle code. Our toggle    method starts on line 33. It goes like this: we get the   and grab the   holding the group in it and the   used to display the plus or minus icon. We can toggle the group  the    and immediately check whether it’s now visible. All that’s left to do is adjust the image’s source ﬁle and alternative text  let’s think about accessibility here, you never know. . .  , as well as the link’s title  used, for instance, to display tooltips when the mouse hovers on the link’s area for a short time .  Of course, our method is useless if we don’t call it somewhere. This is what we do in our handleTreeClick    handler, as you can see on line 51.  Being able to toggle groups on and off raises questions about selection and node creation. Adding a node as a child of a collapsed group would be invisible, unless we make the node visible by expanding its parent group. More generally, creating a node  or selecting it  by code, which means it could be any node, at any depth within the tree, should make this node visible.  So, let’s start by writing a simple makeVisible    method  starting on line 13  that recursively expands any parent group of the node passed to it. Then we just need to call it when a DOM fragment is created  on line 7 , catering to programmatic node creation, and when a node is programmatically selected  on line 28 .  We’ve been very brave. We’re done with our  slightly long-winded, but, hey, doesn’t this small page feel snappy?!  full example. There are still a host of features provided by DOM extension, though, so we’ll quickly ﬂy through them in the following pages.  Inserting New Contents Inserting new contents in the DOM is a common need, especially when using Ajax. Here are a few scenarios that keep popping up when devel- oping web apps:    There’s this Ajax processing you do that needs to have some place  to put its error messages when something gets borked.    The user adds an item by ﬁlling in a form, which is then submitted through Ajax. What comes back from the server is the polished XHTML fragment that now needs to ﬁnd its place at the bottom of the item list  perhaps a shopping cart or a comments listing . A highlight effect would be nice, too, but we’ll get to that later.   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  156    You’ve got this cool web-based chat application  who said “Camp- ﬁre?” , and as new dialogue comes in, it needs to be appended to the room transcript.    Your message list displays incoming e-mail from most recent to oldest, conforming with the user’s preferences. As you routinely check for new messages, you suddenly need to put the fresh ones at the top of the list.  You see? It’s all over the place.  Lightweight DOM Element Creation new Element tagName [, attributes]  → HTMLElement  Version 1.6 introduces a lightweight DOM element creator, which is a trimmed-down version of script.aculo.us’s Builder facility. It lets you cre- ate elements in a straightforward manner by simply invoking Element as a constructor, with at least a tag name  the case is irrelevant  and possibly a hash-like object containing the attributes. For instance:  var header = new Element 'h1', { id: 'mainTitle', lang: 'fr' } ; header.appendChild document.createTextNode 'La construction facile'  ;  You will get details on the syntax for the attributes argument in the de- scription of the writeAttributes    method on page 166.  Replacing vs. Inserting  There are really two categories of contents alteration:    Contents replacement: you want to replace an element’s contents or the element itself. This is done through this element’s update    and replace    methods, respectively, which were described in Sec- tion 7.2, Replacing Contents and Removing Elements, on page 139.   Contents insertion: you need to squeeze new contents some place.  This is what the insertion methods are about.  You could, of course, craft your own code by hand by using the DOM interfaces  those in DOM Level 2 Core and DOM Level 2 HTML, for instance , but you’ll quickly ﬁnd that cross-browser issues actually are legion. There is, naturally, a large set of problems with Internet Explorer, especially when playing inside   elements. But this is only a facet of the troubles you’ll get in.  That is why Prototype takes care of all the cross-browser tricks for you, be it for contents replacement or contents insertion. Believe me, you’re better off using the Prototype methods than embarking on a lonely cru- sade through such barren lands.   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  157  How Is Our XHTML Fragment Processed?  The same way hedgehogs mate: with great care  and a hearty spirit . The general idea  for both update    replace    and the insertion methods  is as follows:  1. The fragment is stripped of its   elements, which are kept  aside.  2. The stripped fragment is inserted, taking care of the cross-browser  issues and potential pitfalls.  3. The scripts originally in the fragment get evaluated; at this point, the elements in the fragment are indeed part of the page’s DOM, so they are accessible through regular scripting.  At this point, you may roar in outrage at the mere thought of inline   tags. But in an Ajax context, this is the only way4 for the server to send both page contents and the companion scripting. A com- mon use case is that of a new item to be appended to a list and then subjected to a highlight effect  you know, this yellow fade thing you keep seeing now and then , or you could make the new content drag- gable or otherwise script-enabled.  As a warning note, you should always use JavaScript   ele- ments  that is, not some other scripting language, such as Internet Explorer’s proprietary VBScript . This is because Prototype will extract the tags and evaluate only their contents  not the tag itself , assuming they are JavaScript.  So, How Do We Insert Stuff?  Version 1.6 provides two new methods that cater to the usual needs, replacing the now-deprecated Insertion object:  insert content  → HTMLElement insert { pos: content [, ... ] }  → HTMLElement wrap  [wrapper = 'div'] [, attributes]  → WrapperHTMLElement  insert    inserts contents before, at the top of, at the bottom of  the default , or after the reference element. This is a replacement of the former Insertion namespace.  4. Well, not quite so, but other ways would have you pull some mean coding and conﬁg- uration tricks, so I ﬁgure they’re just not worth it, compared to how convenient the inline   approach is here. . . .   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  158  There are two ways to invoke it. If you simply pass some content  with the same possible values as for replace    or update   , which we dis- cussed in Section 7.2, Replacing Contents and Removing Elements, on page 139 , it will get inserted at the bottom of the container, but if you pass an object with position-named properties, you can insert content at up to four positions all in one call. The properties of the object you pass are named before, top, bottom, and after, and their possible values were discussed in detail a few sections back.  wrap    wraps the current element with the passed one  the passed con- tents replaces the current element, which is then added as the contents’ last child . You can specify the wrapper element as an existing element or a tag name, or you can leave it to the default  a new   element . You can also pass attributes for the wrapper element, using an attribute hash, which will be applied even when you specify an existing element as the wrapper. Note that you could pass just attributes, which would be applied to a new    which I refrain from doing in the next exam- ple, for the sake of readability . Finally, note that wrap    returns the wrapper element, not the original one. Although this is not very consis- tent with the rest of the API, intensive real-world use showed this to be the more intuitive  and the more useful  way to go.  To better visualize the various insertion types, let’s try them on a demo page. Our page body contains the reference element:  Download prototype insertions index.html  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">         Insertion            Insertion methods    Reference element              ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  159  Then a small script will use all four insertions at page load time, using both invocation syntaxes. This also demonstrates inline scripts:  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  Download prototype insertions demo.js  Line 1  function demoAllInsertions   {     Default syntax $ 'ref' .insert ' ' +  ' bottom  ' ;     Advanced syntax $ 'ref' .insert {  before: '  before  ', top: '  top  ', after: '  after  '  } ;    A bit of inline scripting? $ 'ref' .wrap 'div', { className: 'element wrap' } ; $ 'ref' .insert { top:  ' Such a nice book ' + ' ' + '$ "scripted" .update "Such a great book!" ' + ' ' } ;  }    demoAllInsertions  20  document.observe 'dom:loaded', demoAllInsertions ;  Notice the escaping of   on line 17: this is because such a script would otherwise not be parsed properly if you used it in an inline   element  although it would work just ﬁne using unobtrusive JavaScript .  Finally, a little bit of styling will make things stand out better:  Download prototype insertions demo.css  code, tt { font-size: 115%; color: green; }  ref, .element {  border: 1px solid gray; padding: 1ex; width: 30ex; background: ffd; text-align: center;  }  .element { background: dfd; width: 28ex; } .element.top, .element.before { margin-bottom: 1ex; } .element.bottom, .element.after { margin-top: 1ex; } .element.wrap { background: ddf; width: 32ex; }  The result, loading the page, looks like Figure 7.3, on the next page.   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  160  Figure 7.3: Demonstrating the insertion methods  Meeting the Family: Ancestors, Children, Siblings. . . adjacent expression...  → [ HTMLElement, ... ] ancestors   → [ HTMLElement, ... ] childElements   → [ HTMLElement, ... ] descendantOf ancestor  → Boolean descendants   → [ HTMLElement, ... ] empty   → Boolean nextSiblings   → [ HTMLElement, ... ] previousSiblings   → [ HTMLElement, ... ] siblings   → [ HTMLElement, ... ]  Besides regular DOM walking  with methods such as up    , Prototype can gather entire node chains for you and deal with common lookup cases. It is important to note that these focus on elements. You won’t get any text node, entity reference node, or whatnot.  The methods ancestors   , descendants   , previousSiblings   , and next- Siblings    fetch the whole chain of elements you get in the four usual directions: upward, downward, before, and after your node, respec- tively. A convenience siblings    shortcut returns the whole list of your sibling elements, in document order. Finally, childElements    is a one- level-down narrowing of descendants   , returning only elements that are direct children of your element.   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  161  More recently introduced, adjacent    lets you fetch all siblings  and their children  that match the CSS selectors you’re passing as argu- ments. Technically, those selectors behave exactly like those passed to SelectorﬁndChildElements     see Section 7.3, Selector, on page 167 for details . The current node is, obviously, left out even if it matches; it’s not adjacent to itself!  Selecting Elements with CSS match selector  → Boolean select getElementsBySelector selector...  → [ HTMLElement, ... ]  These methods let you fetch descendant elements by class name or using a full CSS selector  as handled by Prototype’s Selector class, discussed on page 167 . The match    method lets you quickly check whether the current element matches a given selector.  Selectors for select     formerly known as getElementsBySelector     are expressed as strings, in the same way as for Selector.ﬁndChildElements   , which will be discussed later in this chapter. Note, however, that this method is not used much. Most of the time you’ll ﬁnd yourself going with the $$    utility function instead; it’s just faster and more concise.  Tweaking Individual Style Properties getStyle propertyName  → value setStyle { name: value [, ... ] }  CSSPropertiesString  → HTMLElement  Prototype provides elements with a uniform access to style properties  DOM properties representing CSS properties , smoothing over many a browser compatibility issue  and trust me, in this speciﬁc area, com- patibility issues are legion .  First, getStyle    retrieves the speciﬁed  or failing that, computed  value for a speciﬁc CSS property. You can use the CSS syntax  hyphen- separated, as in border-width  or the DOM syntax  camelized, as in borderWidth . Since the DOM syntax is the one ending up being used, providing it directly makes for faster processing. If the property cannot be retrieved or is set to auto, you’ll get a null.  In a general manner, refrain from using CSS shorthand names for prop- erties. Use detailed names as per the DOM Level 2 Style speciﬁcation.  Second, setStyle    lets you set any number of style properties at once by simply passing a “hash” of properties as the ﬁrst argument. Since ver- sion 1.6, the property names must be camel-cased  for example, font- Size, not font-size  when using the “hash” form, and you can use an  Not backward-compatible  with 1.5.x!   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  162  alternate form as a regular CSS property set  exactly like what you would type in an inline style= attribute .  Here are examples of the two call forms:  elt.setStyle 'font-size: 12px;' ; elt.setStyle { fontSize: '12px' } ; elt.setStyle 'font-size: 12px; color: 444' ; elt.setStyle { fontSize: '12px', color: '444' } ;  As a very noticeable browser compatibility effort, both methods provide uniform access to the CSS opacity property, despite Internet Explorer 6 not supporting it. Prototype will work with Internet Explorer’s propri- etary ﬁlter capability to emulate it.  Positioning Prototype extends DOM elements with many position-related methods that let you obtain an element’s position  within a variety of coordinate systems  and play with the element’s position-related aspects.  All of these methods are intensively used inside visual features such as the visual effects and drag-and-drop facilities in script.aculo.us, but this doesn’t mean your own code will never need them. In case you do need them, I include them here.  Until Prototype 1.6, these methods were available through the Position namespace and suffered from inconsistent naming. A recent effort was made to clean this up.  In the following syntax, the PositionInfo type is basically a two-views object. For backward compatibility, it acts as a two-item array  with indices 0 and 1 , holding the left and top coordinates, respectively. In the newer way, it also holds these data in two properties, named left and top. Also note that all coordinates are expressed as numbers, in pixels.  cumulativeOffset   → PositionInfo cumulativeScrollOffset   → PositionInfo positionedOffset   → PositionInfo viewportOffset   → PositionInfo getOffsetParent   → HTMLElement absolutize   → HTMLElement relativize   → HTMLElement clonePosition source [, options]  → PositionInfo   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  163  The whole set of methods ending with -Offset returns a coordinate set. Depending on the coordinate system you’re interested in, you’ll pick one or the other:    cumulativeOffset    returns the position in the document’s system   from the document’s top-left corner, regardless of scrolling .    cumulativeScrollOffset    provides the total scroll offsets of an ele- ment; that is, if this element’s parent chain contains more than one scrolled container, we cumulate scroll offsets. So if our ele- ment is in a   that is in a scrolled   that is in the scrolled document, we’ll take both the document’s scrolling and the  ’s scrolling into account to compute these offsets.    positionedOffset    returns the position in the system of the posi-  tioning container system  see getOffsetParent    a few lines later .    viewportOffset    returns the position in the viewport  the visible part of the document , which is useful to detect, say, that the element is getting over the visible edges of the document. Start- ing with version 1.6, Prototype provides nifty access to viewport dimensions through the document.viewport object. Check out Sec- tion 10.5, Querying the Current Viewport, on page 238 for further details.  getOffsetParent    returns the positioning container of the element. Every positioned element  be it relative or absolute positioning  has a posi- tioning container, which is deﬁned by a nontrivial set of rules in the CSS speciﬁcation, as the “CSS-containing block.”  Sometimes you need to take an element and start manipulating it like it is positioned in a certain way  usually relative or absolute . And perhaps it is not positioned that way yet. You can make it positioned according to your needs without changing its visible position  which would cause a rather troubling sudden movement  by using either absolutize    or relativize   .  Finally, clonePosition    lets you apply the positioning of another element to yours. However, getting the same positioning may not be what you had in mind. You more likely want a derivative positioning, such as “just put me below it, with the same width and its original height”  this is what happens, for instance, with the list of suggestions in script.acu- lo.us’s autocompletion feature .   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  164  Joe Asks. . .  Positioning Container? What Are the Ground Rules Here?  The full details are at http:  www.w3.org TR CSS21 visudet.htmlcontaining-block-details. To make a long story short and ignoring a few edge cases, it goes like this:    If you’re relatively positioned, it’s the content area of  your nearest block-level ancestor.    If you’re ﬁxed, it’s the viewport itself.    If you’re absolutely positioned, it’s usually the padding edge  that is, immediately inside the border  of your nearest positioned ancestor  regardless of its position- ing being relative, ﬁxed, or absolute .  So, the options argument lets you specify which properties you want to clone, using booleans named setLeft, setTop, setWidth, and setHeight. They all default to true. You can also specify an offset from your source element’s position using the offsetLeft and offsetTop properties  they both default to zero .  For instance, script.aculo.us’s Autocompleter.Base code does something like the following:  update.clonePosition element, {  setHeight: false, offsetTop: element.offsetHeight  } ;  This positions the suggestion list  update  right below the text ﬁeld, with the same width as the text ﬁeld but retaining its original height.  Figure 7.4, on the next page, attempts to convey the interrelations of the -Offset methods.  The source code archive for this book contains, in code prototype dom  positioning, a live example that reproduces Figure 7.4 and lets you inter- actively play with scrolls. Hovering on the colored zones will update the results of all four offset methods in a top-right display.   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  165  Figure 7.4: Positioning properties  More Visual Aspects getDimensions   → { width: Number, height: Number } getHeight   → Number getWidth   → Number makeClipping   → HTMLElement makePositioned   → HTMLElement scrollTo   → HTMLElement undoClipping   → HTMLElement undoPositioned   → HTMLElement  Those are a host of position-related methods. The most common ones are getDimensions   , which returns an object with both a width and a height property, plus getHeight    and getWidth   , when you need only one dimension. The others deal with making the element a CSS-con- taining block  makePositioned   , necessary to apply several visual effects  or restricting an element’s rendering to a part of it.  Aside from this, the scrollTo    method is more humble. It simply has the viewport scroll so that the element appears at the top of it, much as if the user had clicked a link to this element’s ID.   ELEMENT, YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND  166  Miscellanea hasAttribute attrName  → Boolean identify   → ElementID inspect   → String readAttribute attrName  → String writeAttribute attrName [, attrValue = true]  → HTMLElement writeAttribute { attrName: attrValue [, ... ] }  → HTMLElement Node.xxx_NODE  Prototype provides a portable, reliable version of hasAttribute   , which is sometimes missing  case in point, Internet Explorer . There is also a readAttribute   method, extensively used by Prototype itself, which provides a portable way of accessing numerous DOM properties rep- resenting HTML attributes and dealing with naming or semantics dis- crepancies from one browser to the next  for example, when working with name= attributes . Both methods take an HTML attribute name.  Version 1.6 introduces the converse operation with writeAttribute   that takes either a single attribute’s name and value or a hash-like object with properties for each attribute to set. It takes care of false and null values by removing the attribute altogether; conversely, true values, used to express the presence of a “ﬂag” attribute  such as disabled= or selected= , follow XHTML guidelines by setting the attribute’s value to its own name  for example, selected="selected" . Other attributes are set without value tweaking.  Do note the attribute names are HTML names, not DOM property names  for example, class instead of className, or for instead of htmlFor .  Also new in version 1.6, the identify    method makes sure the element has a unique ID. Either it already has an id= attribute and it is returned untouched or it lacks one, and a unique attribute, of the form anony- mous_element_X  where X is a unique integer , is generated and as- signed to the attribute. This is useful when you need to refer to the element later by its ID, say, through a generated script or something.  As another effort to help smooth over browser differences, Prototype 1.6 guarantees that the node type constants exist in the Node namespace  this is normally provided by the W3C DOM , so you get, for instance, Node.ELEMENT_NODE and Node.TEXT_NODE  and the ten other constants . We use this internally to avoid “magic numbers” in the Prototype code base, and if you ever dabble with node types, so should you!  We’ve already seen many inspect    methods. This one is actually pretty nice. It provides a markup representation of the element with its id=  writeAttribute allows both, though.   SELECTOR  167  and class= attributes, if any. For instance, a paragraph with an ID of intro and a CSS class name set of hush and fancy will render as <p id="intro" class="hush fancy">  although the actual order of attributes may vary from one browser to the next .  My friend, you deserve a break. You’ve been through the humongous set of DOM extensions provided by Element and are still here to tell the tale. I salute you. But this chapter is not quite ﬁnished yet, though; here’s the tasty Selector class to look at and a few nice debugging tips to learn.  7.3 Selector  Selector is the hidden power of $$   , which we covered extensively in Section 3.4, $$ Searches with Style, on page 45. What $$    actually does is simply call Selector.ﬁndChildElements    over the whole document, with its arguments as the selectors.  And indeed, in the vast  very vast!  majority of times, you’ll just need to go with $$    instead of manually building Selector objects. It’s the easier way, and you won’t take a speed hit because you went for the convenience method. In fact, the only reason you would want to work with Selector directly is if you keep reusing the same selectors over and over again. Then you’ll probably want to squeeze more performance out of your script by analyzing those selectors only once and keeping the resulting Selector objects close at hand.  Before plunging in, remember that all elements returned by a selector are guaranteed extended. Because good things should come in twos.  new Selector expression  → Selector sel.findElements  [root = document]  → [ HTMLElement, ... ] sel.inspect   → String sel.match element  → Boolean sel.toString   → String Selector.matchElements elements, expression  → [ HTMLElement, ... ] Selector.findElement elements [, expression = '*'] [, index = 0]  → HTMLElement Selector.findChildElements element, expression...  → [ HTMLElement, ... ]  “Precompiling” a selector to tuck it away for later use is as simple as cre- ating it. Just use new, and pass it a full CSS expression  not a rule with commas, though; that would require multiple selectors, which is what Selector.ﬁndChildElements    does . If the browser supports DOM Level 3 XPath, Selector will leverage it to achieve blazing speed. Otherwise, it will revert to an optimized DOM JavaScript code base.   DEBUGGING OUR DOM-RELATED CODE  168  Using an existing Selector object for DOM queries is mostly done via its ﬁndElements    method, which you can contextualize by passing a speciﬁc element as the root for your search  otherwise you’ll query the whole document . You can also check whether any given element in the DOM matches your selector by using the match    method.  There’s also the usual duet of string representation methods: toString    returns the original CSS expression passed at construction time, and inspect    returns slightly more debug-oriented text—this same expres- sion surrounded by  .  When you have no Selector object handy, you can still have needs beyond a simple $$    call. Those needs are addressed by Selector. matchElements   , which ﬁlters an existing element set to return only those matching the passed expression, and Selector.ﬁndElement   , which goes one step further by extracting a speciﬁc element from such a resultset.  Astoundingly shrewd readers  yes, that’s you, too  will have noticed that Selector.ﬁndElement    shares its second and third parameters with Element’s DOM-walking methods, such as up   , which we saw in Sec- tion 7.2, Walking Around: Moving Across the DOM, on page 138. The reason is obvious: those methods all rely on Selector.ﬁndElement    when they get passed an expression argument, simply passing the proper ele- ment line as the ﬁrst argument  for instance, up    uses ancestors    . It all comes together and makes some solid sense, wouldn’t you say?  Also note, Selector.ﬁndChildElements    takes a root element  $$    passes it the whole document  and an array of expressions. It then returns the full set of nodes matching those expressions, with no duplicates.  7.4 Debugging Our DOM-Related Code  Debugging DOM-related code the traditional way feels like you’re stum- bling blindfolded in a large room full of echoes. There are basic steps you can take to see the light, or at least get a clearer picture of what you’re dealing with.  Using Firebug Let’s start with the easiest way. If you’re using Firefox  and you should develop on Firefox ﬁrst and then test with other majors browsers! , use   DEBUGGING OUR DOM-RELATED CODE  169  the DOM inspector  and other DOM-related features  in the Firebug5 extension. This lets you see the actual DOM as nested markup, modify some of it on the ﬂy, highlight corresponding elements in the rendered page, and explore DOM objects and all their properties.  The main tool for this is the HTML tab, which represents your doc- ument’s DOM as markup source code, lets you expand and collapse it, select it, highlight in the web page whatever element you’re mousing over in the source pane, see and tweak the current element’s CSS prop- erties  with a special view for its layout-related properties , and view its actual DOM object in detail.  Some of these features are illustrated in Figure 7.5, on the following page, and in Figure 7.6, on the next page.  Using DOM Inspectors Most browsers feature some sort of a DOM inspector, either available directly or through some extra plug-in. Firefox has one out of the box  provided you select it at installation or, on Linux, install the proper package , which is reasonably good  see Figure 7.7, on page 171 .  Internet Explorer has nothing to offer by itself, but the Internet Explorer Developer Toolbar, a browser add-on, provides a host of features target- ing most web developer needs, including inspectors for the DOM, CSS style sheets, and more.  Safari 2 has a hidden Debug menu, which can easily be revealed:  1. Shut Safari down entirely  close all windows, and close the appli-  cation menu .  2. Open a terminal. 3. Type defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeDebugMenu 1. 4. There! Launch Safari again, and behold its gorgeous Debug menu.  And WebKit  which means, by extension, the upcoming Safari 3  comes with a full-blown, nicely polished debugger, plus a DOM inspector and a network monitor.  Now we’re talking!   Finally, Opera provides only a detailed, ﬁlter-capable message window, with no extra developer tools. When it comes to DOM debugging, you’re pretty much on your own. However, Opera has excellent W3C DOM support. If your code works on Firefox and Safari, there is extremely little chance it would bork on Opera.  5. http:  getﬁrebug.com   DEBUGGING OUR DOM-RELATED CODE  170  Figure 7.5: Firebug’s DOM inspector in action  Figure 7.6: Alternate views in Firebug’s DOM inspector   DEBUGGING OUR DOM-RELATED CODE  171  Figure 7.7: The DOM inspector in Firefox  Last-Resort Debugging If you ﬁnd yourself in such a tight spot as having to debug DOM issues with no developer tool whatsoever in your browser  what the heck are you doing!? , you can at least use Prototype’s DOM abilities to construct DOM source representations and either alert    those  which can quickly become a nightmare  or log them into an ad hoc element on your web page  such as a   with a style along the lines of position: absolute; width: 15em; height: 30em; right: 1em; top: 1em; border: 1px solid black; background: silver; opacity: 0.5; overﬂow: auto; font-family: monospace; padding: 0.2em; .  You can then walk the DOM node using the methods we saw earlier on page 138 and on page 160, build small representations with inspect   , escape the whole thing using escapeHTML    on the String, and add the resulting text at the bottom of the log by wrapping it in a   and using an insertion  as we saw in Section 7.2, Inserting New Contents, on page 155 .   DEBUGGING OUR DOM-RELATED CODE  172  What We Just Learned  There’s a lot to grok in this chapter; DOM extension is at the heart of Prototype and is one of the major reasons why it’s so nice to use. Let’s quickly go over the central points we explored:    DOM extension is the process of slapping extra methods on DOM elements to be used as any native DOM method. Prototype pro- vides tons of such methods out of the box and a mechanism to add your own  Element.addMethods    .    The speed cost of DOM extension is almost null  a few milliseconds at script load to update the prototypes for the DOM elements  on many browsers and slower on Internet Explorer  which doesn’t feature prototypes for DOM interfaces . Still, it’s very reasonable and has an excellent cost beneﬁt ratio  usually less than a mil- lisecond to equip your element with many power tools .    The extension propagates. The starting point is often a call to $   , which returns a guaranteed extended element. Every extended method, when returning one or more elements, guarantees their extension. And element-related methods in the event system also return the extended versions.    All mutative methods  methods that alter the element  return the like this:   for example,  element itself, so you can chain-call element.update ’cool’ .highlight   .    Areas where DOM extension radically shortens your code include DOM traversal, DOM extraction, DOM construction, CSS class processing, and positioning. And that’s not even all. . . .    The Selector API, which is the basis for the well-loved $$    utility function, lets you extract DOM elements based on the full com- plement of CSS 3 selectors, regardless of your browser’s actual support for CSS.   Chapter 8 Form Management  Although this is technically part of Prototype’s DOM extensions, I feel that form manipulation is a topic unto itself. Prototype indeed equips forms, and form ﬁelds, with many extra methods in addition to the generic element extensions. Because forms are such an important part of web app development, I decided to cover these extensions in a speciﬁc chapter.  Form.Element vs. Field  First, note that the “ofﬁcial” namespace for methods grafted upon form elements is, quite unsurprisingly, Form.Element. However, as this is a somewhat long name, it is aliased to Field. I prefer this shorter version over the more verbose one. So in this book, I use Field in my code and examples. It’s just more concise and no less expressive.  8.1 Toward a Better User Interface  Savvy web developers put increasing effort into the design of the forms in their apps. Proper markup  with an emphasis on semantics and accessibility  is a major step, as is proper styling, which lets us do things like highlight the focused ﬁeld or clearly mark incorrect or in- complete ﬁelds. With a dollop of scripting, we can also provide timely, contextual help on ﬁeld semantics.  This is all well and good, but two key aspects of form ergonomy need your sweet care, too: form navigation  that is, how the user can go from one ﬁeld to the next or previous one  and proper management of ﬁeld enablement.   TOWARD A BETTER USER INTERFACE  174  Navigation is important not only for users with special needs or mouse- less devices. Users will automatically intuit navigation from the form’s layout. They will form expectations on the order of navigation for your ﬁelds, and efﬁcient ones will want to be able to use the keyboard to tab through your ﬁelds even if there is a mouse at hand. Failing to meet their navigational expectations can lead to a lot of frustration.  Management of ﬁeld enablement has many ramiﬁcations, too. When- ever a ﬁeld is enabled, it should be enabled for a good reason. Con- versely, whenever a ﬁeld should not be touched, make sure it cannot be touched. Disable it for the time being.  Properly disabling ﬁelds  including buttons  when they are irrelevant or inoperant is a much better way to go than just leaving them enabled and then responding to their activation with some “Not just now” message, or worse—doing nothing.  Dealing with Focus and Value Selection Let’s start with the fundamentals: giving a ﬁeld the focus  making it the primary target of keyboard activity . Users may expect, at least for certain text ﬁelds, that they will automatically select their textual contents when focused. Maybe the optimal ergonomy for this particu- lar app screen requires such a thing for massive, batch-mode use, for instance. Whenever there is a clearly dominant use case on a text ﬁeld where preselecting the contents is nice, you should do it.  fieldElt.activate   → fieldElt fieldElt.clear   → fieldElt Field.focus fieldElt  → fieldElt fieldElt.present   → Boolean Field.select fieldElt  → fieldElt  Field elements already feature native focus    and select    methods. Those do not return the original ﬁeld, however, which means you can- not easily call-chain:     NONE OF THIS WILL WORK! $ 'edtLogin' .focus  .setStyle { backgroundColor: 'ffd' } ; $ 'edtLogin' .focus  .select  ;  Call-chaining is a very nice card to have up your sleeve in order to write more concise code, which is why Prototype makes most of its DOM extensions call-chain-friendly and, in our speciﬁc case here, provides two “static” methods. This preserves the original methods and their semantics but still provides a chain-enabled variant:  Field.focus 'edtLogin' .select  ;   TOWARD A BETTER USER INTERFACE  175  Because focusing a ﬁeld, and then selecting its textual contents, is such a recurrent need, Prototype equips ﬁelds with a new method called acti- vate   . It ﬁrst focuses the ﬁeld, and then if it’s an appropriate ﬁeld type  for example, an   with type="input" or a   , it selects its contents.  As for the value itself, present    tests that it is not empty  a regular empty string , and clear   , well, clears the value.  As we discussed earlier, a clean, intuitive keyboard navigation path across form ﬁelds is important. This usually relies on proper document ordering and well-chosen tabindex= attribute values, but from a script- ing point of view, there is more to do.  formElt.findFirstElement   → fieldElt formElt.focusFirstElement   → formElt Form.reset formElt  → form  A common best practice for most web app screens with a main form mandates that we focus this form’s ﬁrst element when the page is loaded so as to get the user in a position to immediately use it, without having to click the element or tab their way to it.  Of course, the concept of a “ﬁrst” element is more complex than it sounds. Is it the ﬁrst element in document order or the ﬁrst one once the layout is applied? Or maybe the form layout obeys customs or legal requirements that make it have a few ﬁelds ﬁrst that are generally left untouched and the ﬁrst ﬁeld that should get the focus appears fur- ther down? We’d usually mark this with a proper tabindex=, but then should “ﬁrst” follow those attributes? And what about element enable- ment? Should we ignore disabled elements? What about visibility?  These are the kinds of questions you start asking yourself, and a few months later your loved ones will ﬁnd you drooling and babbling in tongues, all rolled up in a fetal position in a dark corner under your desk. Allow me to rescue your endangered sanity by detailing how ﬁnd- FirstElement   , which you call on the containing  , goes about it:  1. The method starts by getting all ﬁelds in the form that are nei- ther of a hidden type  not to be confused with styling, which we blissfully ignore1  nor disabled.  2. Then we look for the smallest value of the tabindex= attribute  among the remaining elements.  1. As we discussed in the Joe Asks. . . on page 153, dealing with this would be practically infeasible.   TOWARD A BETTER USER INTERFACE  176  3. If we ﬁnd one, we use the resulting ﬁeld.  4. Otherwise, we use the ﬁrst  ,  , or   we  get, in document order.  In practice, this algorithm maps rather well to the intuitive notion of the “ﬁrst” element.  Since most of the time we want to grab the ﬁrst element to give it focus  and select its textual contents, if appropriate , Prototype rolls in a con- venience method for this: focusFirstElement   , which is a neat combina- tion of ﬁndFirstElement    and activate   .  Finally, again for the sake of call-chaining, there is a “static” variant of the native reset    method for forms, which returns the original form element  something the native method may or may not do . Recall that resetting a form does not mean clearing it. It means resetting all ﬁelds to the values deﬁned in the original markup.  Enabling and Disabling Elements fieldElt.disable   → fieldElt fieldElt.enable   → fieldElt formElt.disable   → formElt formElt.enable   → formElt  We discussed earlier how important it is to disable any UI element that is, in fact, useless at the moment. Maybe this is a Delete button for items in a list, where no items are currently selected. Or maybe this is a form submission button, and the form is currently being sent  either through Ajax or the regular way; that’s irrelevant . Perhaps you’re deal- ing with a Clear button for a shopping cart, which is indeed currently empty.  Whatever the business logic, if your UI element should not be used at this point in time, it should not be usable. Users will expect, and rightly so, that UI elements available to them should perform properly, instead of burping message dialogs with notiﬁcations such as “Sorry, can’t do that now.”  Prototype endows form ﬁelds with two methods, enable    and disable   , that alter the disabled DOM property. It makes certain that the element loses focus before being disabled, because this can be an issue in a few browsers.   LOOKING AT FORM FIELDS  177  Disabled? Let It Show!  A few browsers do not efﬁciently display disabled elements; for instance, Konqueror and Internet Explorer do not alter the font color of disabled drop-down listboxes or the back- ground color of disabled ﬂat listboxes or multiline text ﬁelds  and single-line too, on Internet Explorer . Opera does not alter the background color of checkboxes and radio but- tons. Such lackings make it impossible for the user to under- stand at a glance that part of the UI is off-limits.  This can be ﬁxed quickly with a bit of CSS styling. If you’re targeting CSS 2–compatible browsers, just use something like this:  *[disabled] { background-color: ccc; color: gray; }   CSS 3 would even let us use *:disabled, but do you really want to exclude Internet Explorer for another decade?   If you must support browsers that do not feature CSS 2 attribute selectors, you will need to equip your disabled ele- ments with speciﬁc class names, too. This can be done easily with Prototype’s magic:  $ 'myForm .select '*:disabled' .invoke 'addClassName',    ...and later on, re-enabling... $ 'myForm' .select '.disabled' .invoke 'removeClassName',  'disabled' ;  'disabled' ;  There is also a common use case where you need to disable an entire form  or enable it . Well, that’s a piece of cake—just use the same meth- ods over the form itself, instead of speciﬁc elements.  8.2 Looking at Form Fields  formElt.getElements   → [ fieldElt, ... ] formElt.getInputs  [typeName] [, name]  → [ fieldElt, ... ]  We often need to grab some or all of the elements in a speciﬁc form. Even inside Prototype, this is a common task: to disable or enable all the ﬁelds, to ﬁnd the ﬁrst one, or to serialize the form or determine whether anything has changed since the last time we looked. . . .  The catchall approach is to use getElements   , which returns all ﬁelds in the form, in document order. This includes   tags having   SUBMITTING FORMS THROUGH AJAX  178  type="hidden", disabled ﬁelds, and so on. However,   ﬁelds are omitted; only  ,  , and   tags are taken into account.  If you need to be more surgical about it  which is a good thing , you can go with getInputs   . This one is designed speciﬁcally for those cases where you need to fetch   ﬁelds, usually with a speciﬁc type=, name=, or both.  For this second method to work properly, you’d better stick to lowercase  ofﬁcial XHTML  type names in your markup, your DOM generation code, and your getInputs    calls. In the same vein, name ﬁltering is case- sensitive. If you need to ﬁlter on name but not on type, simply pass null as the ﬁrst argument. Elements are returned in document order.  Here’s a common use case: do you want to check whether any of the checkboxes with name="answer" is, indeed, checked? There you go:  if  $ 'myForm' .getInputs 'checkbox', 'answer' .pluck 'checked' .any        ...  However, if you need more advanced ﬁltering, you’ll have a simpler time using methods such as $$    or select   . For instance, assuming your required ﬁelds all have Req in their id= attributes, you could check  naively, because this relies on empty strings, not blank strings  that they’re all ﬁlled in like this:  if  $ 'myForm' .select '*[name*="Req"]' .invoke 'present' .all        Missing fields!  Whatever the method you used, all returned elements are extended for your DOM extension pleasure.  8.3 Submitting Forms Through Ajax  Indeed, Ajax-based form submission is at the heart of the new gener- ation of web applications, so if you haven’t got on board yet, it’s about time. I’ll help you in, don’t worry. But before plunging into Ajax  some- thing we’ll do in detail in Chapter 9, Ajax Has Never Been So Easy, on page 186 , we need to consider what’s in a form?  Shape Shifters: The Changing Nature of Field Values fieldElt.getValue   → value  [ value, ... ] fieldElt.setValue value  [ value, ... ]  → HTMLElement  Depending on the nature of a ﬁeld, its value can take one of two forms: a single value  usually a string or, for checkboxes and radio buttons,   SUBMITTING FORMS THROUGH AJAX  179  a boolean  or an array of values. This second variant happens in only one situation: listboxes with multiple selections enabled  <select multi- ple=multiple"> .  Now for those pesky details that you will wonder about at least once:    Unchecked radio buttons and checkboxes yield the value null. Oth- erwise, they yield their value property, which is based on their value= attribute  you should always specify this attribute, which has no normalized default value .    Other   elements yield their value property, based on user  interaction  full text contents for text ﬁelds, for instance .    Single-selection listboxes  drop-down or ﬂat  yield the value of the selected option in a DOM-compliant way  Internet Explorer would otherwise fail to use the option’s text if no value= attribute were speciﬁed .    Multiple-selection listboxes yield an array of option values, ob- tained in a DOM-compliant way in the document order of the rel- evant   elements.  Version 1.6 introduces the reverse operation, setValue   , which lets you set a ﬁeld’s value using the same value syntax you’d get as a result of getValue   . It relies on the same internal mechanisms, so consistency is guaranteed. This comes in handy when you need to populate a form dynamically  perhaps from JSON data fetched through Ajax .  One last thing: remember the $F    utility function is actually an alias of getValue   .  Serializing Fields and Whole Forms Getting a single ﬁeld’s value in a uniﬁed way is nice enough, but most of the time you’ll need to take some or all of the ﬁelds in a form, mash them together into some reliable string representation, and send that over to the server side.  How Can I Serialize Then?  To serialize, just use a nice method from Prototype, of course. And you have a few to choose from, depending on your use case:  fieldElt.serialize   → String formElt.serialize  [options]  → String  hashObj Form.serializeElements elements, [options]  → String  hashObj  Let’s start simple, with the serialization of only one ﬁeld. All ﬁelds fea- ture a serialize    method, which either returns an empty string  if the   SUBMITTING FORMS THROUGH AJAX  180  Joe Asks. . .  Why Should I Serialize?  You use serialization when you captured information thanks to a form ﬁeld  or a whole form  and now need to send this data over the wire in some suitable format. And Prototype’s serialization plays nicely with HTTP.  When a form is submitted the regular way, the browser takes care of this for you. When you take over, you’re a bit more on your own. Serialization becomes your business, not the browser’s anymore.  You can do this from an HTML page in two ways: with a GET request, using URL-encoded parameters right in the URL  as in  myapp users list?ﬁlter=john&details=yes , or with a POST request, using parameters in the request body. The default format for these is, indeed, the very same URL-encoding you would use in a GET request. It is the format attached to the MIME type application x-www-form-urlencoded, which rules supreme on the Web.  That is why our serialization methods use that format. If you need something else  say, XML or JSON , you can easily grab the form ﬁelds you’re interested in—which is what we learned to do in the previous section—and cook it up just to your taste  a pinch of basil would be nice . It can be as simple as this:  Object.toJSON $ ourForm .serialize true    Calling serialize true  returns a hash-like object instead of the default serialized string. The generic Object.toJSON    mecha- nism will easily process this vanilla object. But for most cases, you should be happy with the default serialization. After all, this is what most server-side technologies natively work with.   SUBMITTING FORMS THROUGH AJAX  181  ﬁeld value is undeﬁned, which should almost never happen except for ﬁles  or returns a name=value string, with its two parts properly URL- encoded.  Now, here’s the nitty-gritty, which mostly boils down to regular HTML form serialization:    Values are based on the getValue    method we discussed earlier.    Fields with null values will be handled as if their value were an  empty string.  as key  no = sign .    Fields with undeﬁned values will be serialized with only their name    Fields with array values  that is, multiple-selection listboxes  get serialized as if there were multiple ﬁelds with this same name, one per value.  The two other methods are closely related and deal with serializing part or all of a form. Calling serialize    on a form simply forwards to Form.serializeElements    using all elements in the form  except for type="submit" elements, where only one will be used, which is by default the ﬁrst one .  Most of the time you’re happy with a URL-encoded string represen- tation, which is what you get by default. If you pass a hash option with the value true, you’ll get the resulting hash object  not actually a Hash instance, just a vanilla JavaScript object  back, containing all ﬁeld names and values, which you can then use to build your own serialization.  By default, if there are multiple type="submit" ﬁelds, only the ﬁrst one in document order will be serialized. You can change that by specifying the value of the name= attribute for the submission ﬁeld you want to serialize. Just specify it as the submit option.  For instance, the following call:  $ 'myForm' .serialize { hash: true, submit: 'delete' }   . . . will return a serialization hash  not a preencoded string , having used the name="delete" submit ﬁeld instead of the ﬁrst one in the form.   SUBMITTING FORMS THROUGH AJAX  182  What About File Fields?  When a form contains a ﬁle ﬁeld    with type="ﬁle" , traditional serialization cannot happen anymore. Instead of using regular URL-style encoding, the form must be transmit- ted as multipart form-data and encode the ﬁle bytes in a speciﬁc MIME part.  Manually creating this multipart encoding would not be dif- ﬁcult, but JavaScript security prevents it from accessing the contents of local ﬁles directly  unless you tinker with it, which is beyond most user’s abilities or access rights . Because of this, Prototype cannot use actual Ajax for sending local ﬁles.  The usual workaround for this is to use a hidden   as the target for the   and submit the form the regular way. Once the   is done loading the result, we can access it through scripting. This is rather old-school and a bit ugly, but so far this is all we have.  Note than a later version of Prototype may autoswitch to such a technique when you’re trying to Ajaxify a form with ﬁle ﬁelds. In the meantime, you can ﬁnd detailed walkthroughs for this on many web pages, such as http:  www.webtoolkit.info ajax-ﬁle-upload.html  and a Google search on Ajax ﬁle upload will yield tons of other options .  Streamlining Ajax Forms with request This chapter is about forms, not Ajax. We will dive into the details  and multiple options  of Ajax processing in Chapter 9, Ajax Has Never Been So Easy, on page 186. But there is a form-speciﬁc Ajax facility, which we’ll look at quickly here. It appeared in Prototype 1.5.1 and aims at streamlining a very common use case: take a regular form, complete with method= and action=, and submit it over Ajax.  formElt.request  [options]  → Ajax.Request  You’ll have to refer to Section 9.2, Options Common to All Ajax Objects, on page 201 for all the details on the wealth of available options. Just know that this simple call  for example, $ ’myForm’ .request    submits your form through Ajax, using its attributes to determine the HTTP verb   KEEPING AN EYE ON FORMS AND FIELDS  183   GET or POST  and the target URL.2 You can use this to unobtrusively turn your forms over to Ajax when JavaScript is enabled:  document.observe 'contentloaded', function   {  $$ 'form' .invoke 'observe', 'submit', function e  {  e.stop  ; $ Event.element e  .request  ;  } ;  } ;  This covers a common idiom but is certainly not sufﬁcient for all situ- ations. For more advanced needs, you will have to manually use Ajax. Request and its ﬂock.  8.4 Keeping an Eye on Forms and Fields  In Section 6.3, Reacting to Form-Related Content Changes, on page 127, we discovered event-based observers for forms and ﬁelds. Whenever an event was triggered to herald a possible value change on a ﬁeld  or somewhere in a form , these observers would verify that a change had indeed occurred and, if satisﬁed, would trigger a callback.  Such an approach is not always satisfactory: change-related events trigger late  usually when the ﬁeld loses focus , too late for some uses  such as autocompletion or on-the-ﬂy validation . Enter time-based observers:  new Form.Observer formElt, interval, callback  new Field.Observer fieldElt, interval, callback  observer.stop    These observers work the same way, but they require an interval or period  expressed in seconds, with fractional numbers allowed , which determines how often they will check up on the data they’re observing  ﬁeld observers check up on a single ﬁeld, and form observers check up on the whole set of values within the form, relying on serialization for it . Aside from this, the rules do not change. As soon as there actually is a new value  including, obviously, the ﬁrst time it checks , the callback is triggered.  We used a time-based ﬁeld observer in our consolidated example in Chapter 7, Playing with the DOM Is Finally Fun!, on page 130, in order to enable or disable buttons based on whether a text ﬁeld was blank.  2. Starting with Prototype 1.6, if   features no action= attribute or an empty one, the current URL will be used.   KEEPING AN EYE ON FORMS AND FIELDS  184  Waiting for the ﬁeld to lose its focus was inadequate. The user might click the enabled button only to ﬁnd it suddenly disabled because by clicking, the text ﬁeld would lose its focus. Visual feedback needed to take place earlier and be live. The resulting code was confoundingly simple:  new Field.Observer 'edtName', 0.3, function   {  $ 'btnSubmit' .disabled = $F 'edtName' .blank  ;  } ;  Checking every 0.3" is deﬁnitely live enough  the user won’t have to consciously wait after they type to see the UI get updated  but large enough an interval not to hog the processor.  Since Prototype 1.6, these observer classes descend from PeriodicalExe- cuter, so they inherit its stop    method, which lets you put the observer to rest.  1.6  What We Just Learned  Here are the main take-away points about Prototype’s form-related fea- tures:    The features operate at two levels: full forms  the Form namespace  and individual ﬁelds  the Field namespace, which is an alias of Form.Element .    Most methods in these namespaces appear as additional exten-  sions on the relevant DOM elements.    Most of the API deals with value retrieval and setting, either indi- vidually through getValue    and setValue    or at the form’s level through such methods as serialize   .    Prototype smooths over cross-browser inconsistencies in ﬁeld value retrieval  on such issues as no-value-attribute list elements or elements that can be toggled  and provides a powerful value- setting mechanism that helps implement dynamic form ﬁlling.    Form serialization is handy for Ajax submission of the data, but common cases can be automated one step further using the request    method.    Interval-based observers let us react quickly to changes in a form or individual ﬁeld to implement dynamic behavior  such as en- abling or disabling parts of the UI based on the current form data .   KEEPING AN EYE ON FORMS AND FIELDS  185  Neuron Workout    How would you implement an equivalent of Field.Observer using  PeriodicalExecuter3 directly? What about Form.Observer?    Write a method that takes all the radio buttons with a given ﬁeld name and toggles their availability  enables or disables them, de- pending on their state .  3. For details on this class, see Section 10.3, Periodical Execution Without Risk of Reen- trance, on page 231.   Chapter 9 Ajax Has Never Been So Easy  In another book, I might have to explain to you what Ajax is, why it is useful, and why it is not just a fad. But not here. This is a book about Prototype and script.aculo.us, which are big on Ajax. If you have this book, chances are extremely good you know what Ajax is well enough and have embraced the opportunities it offers. So in essence, you’re sold on the idea of Ajax. If you have no idea what it is, you can catch up quickly on the Web, such as at http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki AJAX or http:  developer.mozilla.org en docs AJAX.  But you’re probably dying to know more about it and about how Proto- type and script.aculo.us let you use it to best effect.  As for script.aculo.us, it does provide wonderful little Ajax-based con- trols, such as an autocompleted text ﬁeld. Many common Ajax-related use cases  for example, sorting a list and persisting its new order server- side  will be best approached using script.aculo.us stuff, so we will delay such examples until a later chapter.  But when it comes to Prototype itself, there’s a lot to have fun with. Because simply listing and explaining the classes, options, and call- backs would probably be a bit dry, I decided to lace this chapter with several core implementations of actual web app features you’re likely to need on real-world projects. Those are the “Get It” sections in this chapter. They do their best to illustrate most of the API.  9.1 Before We Start. . .  Yes, you’re giddy with anticipation. I know, I can’t wait to show you this stuff, too. But before we get on with Prototype objects and let the magic ﬂow, there are a few general issues I’d like to talk to you about.   BEFORE WE STAR T. . .  187  Technical Limitations You Should Know About There are essentially two constraints in Ajax: the SOP and the two- request limit.  The Same Origin Policy  SOP  essentially mandates that Ajax requests cannot access another fully qualiﬁed domain than the page from which they’re running. You can’t even access the same domain on another port. This makes a lot of sense, securitywise, because this would open a Pandora’s box of cross-site scripting  XSS  attacks. Imagine a malevo- lent script running on a sensitive intranet page that could use its priv- ileged position to access conﬁdential data and then silently send those over to its author’s cracking domain. . . . Not good.  The SOP is all about XSS  how’s that for a geek phrase?  and also pre- scribes what other documents in the browser a given script is allowed to access  for example, explore or modify their DOM . Originated in Netscape Communicator 2.0, this approach is widely supported by modern browsers  although as usual, Internet Explorer acts the lone wolf on this . You’ll ﬁnd a great description of the SOP, and links to more detailed resources, on the ever-useful Wikipedia: http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Same_origin_policy.  The second general issue you need to keep in mind when designing Ajax-based pages, especially if you intend to use Ajax heavily, is the infamous two-request limit. This is a recommendation in the deﬁning standard for us kids: HTTP 1.1. It is described in RFC 2616, and sec- tion 8.1.41 clearly states that “a single-user client SHOULD NOT main- tain more than 2 connections with any server or proxy. [. . . ] This is intended to improve HTTP response time and avoid congestion.”  Most modern browsers abide by this rule, including Internet Explorer. True, you can tweak this, but this requires manual client-side conﬁg- uration  for Internet Explorer, you would have to tweak a registry key, and Firefox would have you tinker at internal options using about:conﬁg . In short, unless you have an absolute need for more simultaneous request, have servers that can indeed handle the resulting load, and have enough control over the whole browser base  as in an intranet , you can forget using more than two connections at once.  This works for any request, incidentally. When the browser fetches external resources for your web page, such as images, CSS ﬁles, script ﬁles, and the like, it follows this guideline as well. Have a look at Fire-  1. http:  tools.ietf.org html rfc2616section-8.1.4   BEFORE WE STAR T. . .  188  Figure 9.1: The two-request limit in action at http:  prototypejs.org  bug’s Net tab for the home page of Prototype’s ofﬁcial site, shown in Figure 9.1. Notice how there are never more than two resources being loaded at any given time.  There are workarounds, of course, such as tinkering with   to create the illusion of multiple “users”  from a HTTP 1.1 standpoint , playing with server-side conﬁguration and DNS mapping to alias multi- ple subdomains over the same server, and distributing requests across such domains  which brings quite a few issues though, such as being careful with cookies and the SOP . Still, I believe 99.9% of the UI needs for web applications should be properly covered despite the two-request limit, especially with a fast server.  Under the Hood: A Quick XHR Primer We’re entering a critical topic, and I believe a bit of background wouldn’t hurt, both on the path that led to today’s situation and on the technical tidbits.  A Tiny Bit of History Ajax is all about a small object named XMLHttpRequest.2 And because good men put credit where it’s due, I ﬁnd it important to state that this one was invented by none other than Microsoft. It ﬁrst appeared in Internet Explorer 5.0, all the way back in 1999. The ﬁrst compatible implementation appeared in Mozilla 1.0 in 2002, and now every major browser  including Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Konqueror  plus a few  2. Well, technically, on some occasions you’ll have to revert to ugly   tricks, but hey!   BEFORE WE STAR T. . .  189  smaller players  for example, iCab  feature it with a rather good com- patibility. All those compatible implementations are exposed as a native JavaScript object.  Although originally a proprietary technology, XMLHttpRequest was deemed of sufﬁcient interest to now be speciﬁed by a W3C recommen- dation,3 which at the time of this writing is about to enter a second  !  Last Call phase and should become an ofﬁcial standard sometime before 2007 ends. This working draft is already used as the basis for interoperability by implementations in all the major browsers.  XMLHttpRequest was originally exposed to the script as an ActiveX and remained so until Internet Explorer 7.0, which ﬁnally provides it as a native JavaScript object, thereby adopting a uniﬁed model with other browsers and making it available to security-conscious environments.  The Life and Works of XHR  In the rest of this book, we’ll mostly use the shorter XHR abbrevia- tion for it. An XHR object has the following life cycle  normative states appear in italics :  1. You create it. It’s uninitialized.  2. You open a connection to the server side. It’s open.  3. If necessary, you set request headers according to your needs.  4. You send the request  and any body contents for the HTTP request  you may need to include . It becomes sent.  5. The server side starts responding. Your object is now receiving.  6. You’re done getting all of the response. It is now loaded.  This is the ofﬁcial life cycle, but legacy implementations, which are still the most widespread ones, may differ slightly. As we’ll see in Sec- tion 9.2, Hooking Up Our Code: Ajax Callbacks, on page 203, Proto- type deﬁnes a series of callbacks for state changes and events mapping to the ofﬁcial states, plus a few ones. But not all those callbacks are “guaranteed.” Some of them may not ﬁre with the same semantics on all browsers or sometimes not ﬁre at all; I even see occasional reports of callbacks ﬁring in a different order, although reproducing these odd- ities often proves challenging. Fortunately, the key ones  especially the completion-related ones  are safe.  3. http:  www.w3.org TR XMLHttpRequest    BEFORE WE STAR T. . .  190  Should We Reuse Our XHR Objects?  Although in Prototype this translates to “Should we reuse our Ajax.* objects?” the question is just as valid. These are network connections we’re talking about. Such an object has a nontrivial creation and ini- tialization cost, and we may want to reuse them in order to speed things up.  Well, let me give you some perspective.  First, from a technical standpoint, reuse is not free of issues, depending on the browser you’re on, the way you manipulate the original methods of the XHR object, and a few other points. So, it’s not as simple as simply keeping a reference on it and ending up calling open    and send    again and again.  Second, this is UI we’re talking about. You’re using Ajax to smooth things up, to make your UI snappier, to avoid full-page reload, and to interact more richly with the user. The time constraints we face here are user time, where a satisfactory response delay is of the order of one second. Plus, we’re bound by this two-request limit anyway. Overusing XHR objects will end up delaying most of them, resulting in the opposite effect: increased latency.  For the overall scheme of things, the setup cost for an XHR object  and thus, for an Ajax.* object in Prototype  is fairly negligible. If your UI is properly designed  especially from an ergonomy perspective , you’ll be well in the clear with creating such objects when you need them and discarding the references afterward.  Response Types: XHTML, XML, JS, JSON. . . Yes, the X in Ajax stands for XML. That’s right. That’s also far from real use, as far as I can see when reading the 30-some daily posts on the ofﬁcial Prototype help list,4 used by 4,000+ people.  The simple truth is this: most Ajax responses provide  X HTML frag- ments, JavaScript, or both. This includes JavaScript Object Notation  JSON 5 responses.  “Pure XML”  by which I mean not XHTML, but other XML dialects  responses are quite the rare thing. In my humble opinion, this is be- cause the main reason for XML responses was structured data, and  4. http:  groups.google.com group rubyonrails-spinoffs 5. http:  json.org   BEFORE WE STAR T. . .  191  we get this in a far more convenient format with JSON. All we have to do is eval    it, and we get an immediately usable JavaScript object representing all our data! That sure beats the living crap out of DOM traversal.  Here are a few guidelines to help you decide what format to use, de- pending on your circumstances:    You just dealt with creating or updating an item, which is part of a displayed list that needs to show the new or updated item? Use an item-level template to produce its XHTML fragment, and send it back for client-side insertion in the page. You can append a small inline script to it that will trigger some attention-getter effect  such as a highlight .    You’re being polled so the server keep track of things? Rely on HTTP status codes and minimalistic contents for the response’s text proper  perhaps a simple number or text or a more structured JSON representation .    Your only response is JavaScript code  for example, effect trigger- ing ? Instead of returning an HTML-typed response with a   tag, use a JavaScript MIME type  the most common one being text javascript , and put the raw JavaScript code in the response body. It will be evaluated automatically by the requester object. This constitutes, by far, the easiest way to return dynamic behavior from the server side so your client page executes it.    You have no idea what I’m talking about? Just read on and grab  the examples.  JSON and Prototype: Like Peas in a Pod. . . Now  When Prototype 1.5.0 was released in January 2007, the help list began receiving a lot of buzz about issues people were having with their Ajax features being broken all of a sudden. As it turned out, Prototype’s Ajax request header mechanism relied on JavaScript’s for. . . in loop, which iterates over all the properties of an object. The object used here was a local anonymous one, which sounded safe enough.  Well, it was safe until some loaded script breaks the ground rules and starts expanding Object.prototype: then we get in trouble. That is what, unfortunately, the “ofﬁcial” JSON library, json.js, does. The thing is, when you get interested in JSON, you go to its ofﬁcial site, discover there’s a library all waiting for you, and grab it! It’s too bad it comes   HITTING THE ROAD: AJAX.REQUEST  192  with this major misbehavior. Of course, this impacts users who rely on higher-level frameworks that provided the same  or same kind of  code, such as Rico. All in all, that’s a lot of people.  Prototype 1.5.1 decided to retain the occasional for. . . in loop, which should never break when other scripts behave, but it implemented JSON support  and credit for that mostly goes to Tobie Langel . It intro- duced built-in, comprehensive JSON support, from JSON parsing to JSON building, all of which is described in Section 4.7, Full-Spectrum JSON Support, on page 82.  Prototype 1.6 also introduces a host of new JSON-related options for requests, plus the new Ajax.Response object, which do a terriﬁc job sim- plifying JSON processing in an Ajax context. You have Tobie Langel to thank for that.  9.2 Hitting the Road: Ajax.Request  We’re not going to dive into the details of raw XHR objects. There’s just no point. With Prototype, you’ll never need to touch these objects directly, at least not until they’re done with the whole request response thing. So, why bother? We’re much better off focusing on the features and objects Prototype offers us.  Ajax.Request is the fundamental requester object. The other ones all depend on it. It’s the heart of Prototype’s Ajax support. Using it is fairly simple: just create the object with the proper arguments and options, and off it goes, querying your server side and dealing with the response! You usually won’t even need to store the object reference  as we discussed in Section 9.1, Should We Reuse Our XHR Objects?, on page 190 .  new Ajax.Request url [, options]   I tried to make this as lively as possible, because there is a lot to discover and learn. So, we’ll go through an actual application feature example ﬁrst and then go through the common options and callbacks all Ajax.* objects share.  Get It: Geometry Persistence Our ﬁrst example will use Ajax to implement geometry persistence. In a less formal tone, we’re trying to keep widgets tucked somewhere from one page view to the next, OK? Here’s how it goes:   HITTING THE ROAD: AJAX.REQUEST  193    The server side holds the “geometry” of each widget. To keep things simple and the code concise enough, we’ll assume that they do have a default position and that the user can only move them, not resize them.    The server side is used to produce the initial page view, which is necessary in order for page views to restore any previously per- sisted geometry.    Whenever a widget is moved, we react to the move’s ending by synchronizing the server-side storage. To do that, we use a simple Ajax request containing the geometry of all widgets.  We’re going to use Ruby scripts to provide a server side for all our Ajax- enabled examples. You may panic a bit at this if you don’t know a thing about Ruby or have never used it yourself before. As Douglas Adams would say, Don’t Panic. It’s a walk in the park. Head over to the few pages in Appendix C, on page 414, and then come back ready to play; it’s quick and painless—it’s even fun!  To keep things simple, there’s no actual database here—only global variables storing both the widgets’ contents  title and text  and their geometry. Here goes the server script:  Download prototype ajax geometry server.rb  Line 1  !  usr bin env ruby  require 'cgi' require 'erb' require 'webrick' include WEBrick  template_text = File.read 'index.rhtml'  template = ERB.new template_text   server = HTTPServer.new :Port => 8042  server.mount ' ', HTTPServlet::FileHandler, '.'

Looking at the parameter analysis snippet starting at line 36, you can see that we expect a set of three parameters for each widget, with each parame- ter being sufﬁxed with the widget’s numerical index. Our client side will take care of building this parameter string properly. It could look something like this:  left0=100&top0=50&zIndex0=1&left1=224&top1=100&zIndex1=2. . .  The template for the whole page is fairly simple. It just uses a loop over LABELS to produce properly styled XHTML fragments with an adequate title and contents. It’s nothing too fancy:  Download prototype ajax geometry index.rhtml  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">         Drag it up!       <script type="text javascript"   HITTING THE ROAD: AJAX.REQUEST  195  src="scriptaculous.js?load=effects,dragdrop">             Drag it up!   <% LABELS.each_with_index do labels, index  pos = $geometry[index] style = "top: {pos[:top]}px; left: {pos[:left]}px; " style += "z-index: {pos[:zIndex]};"  %>  " class="widget" style=" ">                        .widget {  Of course, this will require a dollop of CSS styling to look any good:  Download prototype ajax geometry geometry.css  position: absolute; top: 5em; width: 15em; border: 0.25em solid gray; background: silver; padding: 1em 0.5em 0.5em; overflow: auto;  }  }  }  }  .widget h2 {  position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; height: 1.5em; font-size: inherit; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0; padding: 0 0.2ex; background: gray; cursor: move;  win0 {  border-color: red; background: fdd; height: 8em; left: 2em;  win0 h2 { background: f99; color: maroon; }  win1 {  border-color: green; background: dfd; left: 20em; height: 10em;   HITTING THE ROAD: AJAX.REQUEST  196  Figure 9.2: Our initial view.

Get a shell in this example’s directory, and start your server:  $ ruby server.rb [2007-03-09 23:19:49] INFO [2007-03-09 23:19:49] INFO [2007-03-09 23:19:55] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1 ruby 1.8.5  2006-08-25  [i486-linux] WEBrick::HTTPServerstart: pid=24720 port=8042  OK, let’s ﬁre up our trusty browser and navigate to http:  localhost:8042 home  don’t forget the  home at the end, or you’ll get no response or even a mistaken binary download attempt . We should get something like Fig- ure 9.2.   HITTING THE ROAD: AJAX.REQUEST  197  The XHTML fragment for our widgets looks like this:  <div id="win0" class="widget"  style="top: 100px; left: 20px; z-index: 1;">   Some widget   This is a widget      <div id="win1" class="widget"  style="top: 160px; left: 220px; z-index: 2;">   Some other widget   This is another widget.

HITTING THE ROAD: AJAX.REQUEST  198  Now for the JavaScript. We’ll resort to some script.aculo.us mojo to bring off the drag and drop. When the page is done loading, we create Draggable objects6 over every widget, using its internal   as a han- dle  dragging by the title bar is a natural UI reﬂex for most folks . We’ll also register a global drag-and-drop observer to react to drags ending by ﬁring up an Ajax request.  It doesn’t even take 40 lines of JavaScript to cover the whole process:  Download prototype ajax geometry geometry.js  Line 1  function bindWidgets   {  var widgets = $$ '.widget' ; widgets.each function w  {  15  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  25  30  35  var handle = w.down 'h2' ; handle.observe 'mousedown', function   {  raiseWidget widgets, w ;  } ; new Draggable w, { handle: handle, zindex: false } ;  } ;  10  }    bindWidgets  function raiseWidget widgets, widget  {  var widgetZIndex = widget.getStyle 'zIndex' ; widgets.each function w  {  var zI = w.getStyle 'zIndex' ; if  zI > widgetZIndex   w.setStyle { zIndex: zI - 1 } ;  } ; widget.setStyle { zIndex: widgets.length } ;  20  }    raiseWidget  function syncGeometryOnServer   {  var widgets = $$ '.widget' ; var params = {}; widgets.each function w, index  {  var pos = Position.cumulativeOffset w ; params['left' + index] = pos[0]; params['top' + index] = pos[1]; params['zIndex' + index] = w.getStyle 'zIndex' ;  } ; new Ajax.Request ' geometry', { parameters: params } ;  }    syncGeometryOnServer  Draggables.addObserver { onEnd: syncGeometryOnServer } ;  document.observe 'dom:loaded', bindWidgets ;  6. We’ll explore Draggable in detail later in this book, in Section 15.1, Dragging Stuff Around, on page 283.   HITTING THE ROAD: AJAX.REQUEST  199  The bindWidgets    method iterates over our widgets  any element with class="widget" , isolates the   in there, and does two things:    It makes the widget draggable by creating a new Draggable object    It attaches an extra behavior to the handle’s mousedown event:  over it.  raiseWidget   .  The raiseWidget    method is a nice touch we add to make widgets behave more like actual windows: the idea is to make sure the last one clicked or dragged is on top and stays there once the click or drag is over. The default Draggable behavior would temporarily raise the element’s zIndex during the drag and restore it once dropped, which won’t do. Plus, this would require an actual drag, and casual clicks would not bring the widget to the front.  So, what we do here is react to mouse buttons being pressed over a widget drag handle by rearranging zIndex properties so the current one comes naturally on top while preserving the remaining ordering. The algorithm for this is simple enough: take all “higher” widgets one notch down, and then get our own on top.  The actual Ajax magic happens on line 31. This is where we create an Ajax.Request object. Creating it will automatically trigger the request proper. Because this is our ﬁrst example, the call is concise. Only the target URL  look at our server script to see it listens for  geometry requests in order to process updates  and the parameters for it. It will use default values for all other options, which especially means we’re going POST on this one. The parameters will be transmitted as the request’s body in the usual URL-encoded format.  The last trick is, of course, to build these parameters. To avoid tweak- ing URL-encoded stuff, we’ll use the ability of the parameters option to take an object that it then uses as a hash of parameters. Building such an object is simple enough, as the code starting at line 25 demon- strates. For each widget, grab its absolute position, and then add the corresponding properties to the parameters object.  Let’s drag our widgets a few times. Firebug’s Ajax monitoring tells us about the requests that let the server side know what’s going on, as you can see in Figure 9.3, on the following page.  Now just try refreshing the page. Or better: shut down your browser  but leave your server script running . Then ﬁre it back up, and navigate   HITTING THE ROAD: AJAX.REQUEST  200  Figure 9.3: A few drags and their telltale Ajax requests   HITTING THE ROAD: AJAX.REQUEST  201  again to the page  feel free to vacuum your cache before . You end up with a preserved layout! That’s it! Persistent geometry!  Options Common to All Ajax Objects Now that we went through a full, integrated example, I believe the time has come to take a look at the nice range of options you get with all Ajax requesters.  asynchronous  Setting this to false results in synchronous requests, which are requests that will essentially freeze the script until a response has been fully received. That’s rather bad form. Avoid it. I mean it.  Defaults to true.  contentType  This is the format of your request data. If you don’t plan on using the default  which is what the browser would send for both POST and GET requests , change it accordingly so the server side doesn’t have to guess. For instance, you may want to send your data as an XML document or as Base64-encoded binary data.  Defaults to application x-www-form-urlencoded.  encoding  The character encoding for your request. This is best left un- touched, unless you do run into weird encoding issues, but that would usually be because you haven’t gone UTF-8 the whole way. And mark my words: sooner or later, you’ll have to do so. So, you might as well start now and get some mileage.  Defaults to UTF-8.  evalJS  1.6  This controls automatic JavaScript evaluation. Before Prototype 1.6, whenever you got a response with a JavaScript content type  we’ll describe that later in this chapter , your response’s body was regarded as JavaScript and eval’d automatically. We now pro- vide some control over that through this new option. It defaults to true, which preserves usual behavior. But you can set it to false, disabling JavaScript evaluation entirely, or you can go berserk and set it to ’force’, asking for JavaScript evaluation regardless of content type. This latter mode is mostly for the poor guys among us who use a server-side technology so bad it won’t let them cus-   HITTING THE ROAD: AJAX.REQUEST  202  tomize their response handlers  I suggest a minute of silence for them .  evalJSON  1.6  Also introduced in Prototype 1.6, this new option controls whether to enable automatic JSON evaluation, evaluating the response body as JSON and storing the resulting object in the response object’s responseJSON property. It defaults to true, and just like evalJS, it can also be false or ’force’, with the same semantics. The JSON content type is application json. Also see sanitizeJSON.  method  The HTTP method used. Current implementations guarantee only the two methods allowed by HTML forms: get and post. The W3C recommendation for XMLHttpRequest, however, acknowledging the ever-growing interest of REST, mandates that compatible imple- mentations support all six methods deﬁned by HTTP 1.1, includ- ing for instance put and delete. Currently, using such values  that is, anything but get or post  will trigger one of the very few Rails- speciﬁc behaviors of Prototype. It will actually use post and will include a _method parameter in the data, with the original value. This circumvents the fact that browsers such as Safari and Inter- net Explorer do not yet accept these HTTP methods for XMLHttp- Request.  Defaults to post.  parameters  The parameters to be sent by the request, speciﬁed either as a hash-like object  quite the convenient way and the one we used in our geometry persistence example  or as a predigested, URL- encoded string.  Defaults to the empty string.  postBody  The request body data if you’re using the post method. Because not providing it will use parameters instead and because it does not allow using a hash-like object but requires a properly URL- encoded query string, I advise you to use parameters whenever you don’t need another representation for your data.  No default value.  requestHeaders  The headers sent with your request. It is best to pass a hash-like   HITTING THE ROAD: AJAX.REQUEST  203  object. For backward compatibility, you can also pass an array of values, with even indices for header names and odd indices for header values. However, support for this might be discontinued in later releases, and it’s also a more cryptic way to go, so I advise you to go the hash-object way. The default set contains the following headers:    X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest   X-Prototype-Version: Whatever version you’re using  for exam-    Accept: text javascript, text html, application xml, text xml,    Content-Type: Built based on the contentType and encoding  ple, 1.6.0   and * *  options  sanitizeJSON  1.6  Introduced in Prototype 1.6, this is the companion option to eval- JSON. It controls whether JSON evaluation  be it the X-JSON header or the response body  goes through sanity checks before being evaluated. This delegates to String’s extended evalJSON    method, shown on page 84.  Hooking Up Our Code: Ajax Callbacks  Aside from options proper, you can pass, in the options object, call- backs to be called at speciﬁc times in the request’s life cycle. Prototype deﬁnes quite a handful of those, but beware: XHR-level callbacks are not quite “guaranteed,” meaning they may not work consistently across browsers, because the W3C speciﬁcation has not yet been ﬁnalized, much less widely implemented. Such callbacks are emphasized when listed.  Note that all callbacks, when deﬁned on an individual requester like 1.6 this, are called with two arguments: the current state of the Ajax re- sponse  an Ajax.Response object  and the evaluation of the X-JSON header, if any  this one can be null, especially prior to response com- pletion . The onException callback, however, gets different arguments: the requester object and the exception object.  The Ajax.Response object you get lets you access your response’s data in a comfortable, portable way, smoothing over some issues with the tim- ing restrictions of calling speciﬁc methods on the underlying XHR object  for example, header-related ones  and taking special care of JSON han- dling  because of its rising popularity . We’ll explore it in greater depth later in this chapter.   HITTING THE ROAD: AJAX.REQUEST  204  Ajax.Response and Backward Compatibility  Tobie, who’s responsible for the Ajax.Response refactoring, made sure the code remained backward compatible. This is why these objects feature the same crucial properties, such as transport and readyState.  However, there are many more properties designed to help you manipulate the response in a more portable, type- oriented way. You should get familiar with headerJSON and responseJSON, for instance.  Callbacks are listed here in chronological order, instead of lexicograph- ical order. I thought you’d like to ﬁnd both the callback’s timing and the deﬁnition in the same place.  onCreate  The object was created, with its request about to be prepared and sent.  onUninitialized not guaranteed   The XHR was just created.  onLoading not guaranteed   The XHR is being set up, with its connection open.  onLoaded not guaranteed   The XHR is set up, with its connection open, and is ready to send data.  onInteractive not guaranteed   The XHR has sent its request, and it is now receiving parts of the response.  onFailure  onSuccess  The response was received, its HTTP status code is not considered successful  see next callback , and it doesn’t have a dedicated call- back in place  see onXYZ  .  The response was received, its HTTP status code is considered successful  it’s in the 200–299 range , and it does not have a ded- icated callback in place  see the next callback .   HITTING THE ROAD: AJAX.REQUEST  205  onXYZ  onComplete  onException  The response was received, and its HTTP status code is XYZ. You usually won’t deﬁne such surgical callbacks for successful codes, but you may want to deal in a special way with, say, codes like 302 or 404. . . .7  As you can derive from the three previous callbacks’ deﬁnitions, they are mutually exclusive. When a request is complete, however, you do end up getting onComplete triggered  this is even shielded against exceptions in the speciﬁc callbacks that occur before, for example, onSuccess .  This can actually happen at just about any point in the request life cycle. When something goes wrong, it’s triggered. The second argument is the exception object.  Other Things Our Ajax.Request Can Do There are a few more things your requester can do for you, which can be of assistance in your callbacks’ code. . . .  Every requester has a success    method that implements the success  failure logic  it returns a boolean  used for callback selection. There’s also a getHeader name  method that lets you grab a response header easily and returns null if the header is missing or something borks.  An important feature is automatic JavaScript evaluation. When a re- sponse consists entirely of JavaScript, the best way for the server to send it is to put the raw script in the response body and advertise the response’s content type as JavaScript. Prototype recognizes all accepted values for the response’s Content-Type header  anything with a main type of text or application and a subtype of javascript or ecmascript, possibly preﬁxed with x- .  When such a response is received, the requesters will automatically eval    it. Pay attention to the timing. This occurs after speciﬁc callbacks  onSuccess, onFailure, and onXYZ  , but before the generic onComplete. The evaluation logic is wrapped in the evalResponse    method.  7. For http:  tools.ietf.org html rfc2616.  further details on the HTTP status codes, see the HTTP 1.1 RFC at   HITTING THE ROAD: AJAX.REQUEST  206  This is a very powerful mechanism and easy to leverage from the server side. Rails has RJS templates, for instance, but any good server tech- nology, as long as it has the ability to encode objects to JSON, can quickly whip up similar plumbing. For instance, a recent Rails app of mine features the following template:  page["fee_price_{@att.id}"].update format_price @att.fee_price  .  page['total_price'].update format_price @att.registration.total_price  .  highlight  highlight  This can result in the following JavaScript code being returned to the server  with the proper JavaScript MIME type, which is key to automatic evaluation :  $ 'fee_price_42' .update '100€' .highlight  ; $ 'total_price' .update '250€' .highlight  ;  Dealing with Ajax.Response Starting with Prototype 1.6, the ﬁrst argument to all callbacks  save for onException  is an Ajax.Response object that represents, well, your Ajax response. This object exhibits the following properties and methods, which make it at once backward compatible, safer to use  read: better dealing with exceptions and timing constraints , and more powerful:  getAllHeaders     This is an exception-safe version of getAllResponseHeaders   . It will return null instead of propagating the exception.  getAllResponseHeaders     This forwards to the native method of the same name on the underlying XHR object. It returns all the response headers as a single, protocol-extracted string. But if you’re not yet far along enough  in other words, you didn’t receive all the response head- ers over the wire yet , this raises an INVALID_STATE_ERR exception.  getHeader name   This is the same method as available on Ajax requesters, which I described in the previous section.  getResponseHeader name   This forwards to the native method of the same name on the underlying XHR object. It returns the value for the given header or null if the header doesn’t exist in the response. However, if you’re not far along in receiving the response yet, you’ll get an   HITTING THE ROAD: AJAX.REQUEST  207  INVALID_STATE_ERR exception  as opposed to getHeader   , which will swallow the exception and return a null .  headerJSON  This is a new property introduced in 1.6. It contains the evaluation of the X-JSON header, if any  otherwise it is either undeﬁned or null, depending on how far along the response reception you are . I advise you to rely on this property instead of the second argument to most callbacks, because the latter is likely to be deprecated in later versions of Prototype.  readyState  responseJSON  responseText  responseXML  status  This mirrors the native property of the same name on the underly- ing XHR object. Just remember that 4 means we’re done receiving the response.  This is a new property introduced in 1.6. Based on the JSON- related options  refer to on page 201 , this interprets a JSON re- sponse body. This is a distinct thing from the X-JSON header, and it was one of the prominent JSON-related feature requests for Prototype.  This is a safe version of the native property of the same name. It starts out undeﬁned, then gets read at every state change until completion, and is guaranteed non-null. If it’s not there yet on the underlying XHR object, you will see an empty string. This saves you from special-casing your code.  This is available only once the response completes. This property is either a valid XML document or null. Whether it’s interpreted from the response’s body is decided by the underlying XHR object according to spec  which essentially means you’ll have to send a response with a valid XML MIME type8 .  This returns the underlying XHR object’s property of the same name  or zero if it’s unavailable just yet , which is the HTTP re- sponse code.  8. This is essentially a type ending with either  xml or +xml. . . .   STREAMLINING: AJAX.UPDATER  208  statusText  transport  This is the status text going with the HTTP response status code or the empty string if this text is unavailable yet.  This is the underlying XHR object. This is mostly provided for backward compatibility of your scripts, but I advise you strongly to migrate your code so it uses the response object’s methods and properties instead of going raw like this. They’re more portable, less exception-prone, and overall smarter.  9.3 Streamlining: Ajax.Updater  OK, that was for the common ground and the simple requests. Yet a common need for Ajax requests is to get some XHTML fragment back and inject it into our page. This fragment either replaces existing con- tents or is inserted somewhere. That’s the whole idea of Ajax.Updater. The creation takes one more argument, which actually appears ﬁrst— the container element s  for the returned fragment.  new Ajax.Updater container, url [, options]   We’ll demonstrate this through a search example that will use two new options, speciﬁc to updaters.  Get It: Ajax Search We’re going to put together an Ajax-based search. Because I don’t want you to have to set up a data source to search through, we’ll just use the libraries available to your Ruby server script. As an added perk, that means you have a decent shot at getting exactly the results you see in the book  or close enough, anyway .  The idea is simple: our page has a search ﬁeld, we type a small text in it, and we hit the Search button, which sends an Ajax request. The server returns an XHTML fragment holding the search results  say, a simple   list , which we display in a predeﬁned “search results” element.  First, we need a search page:  Download prototype ajax search1 index.html  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">          STREAMLINING: AJAX.UPDATER  209   Ruby library AJAX search                    Ruby library AJAX search          Your search      Your search                           A pinch of CSS will help: Download prototype ajax search1 search.css  searchForm fieldset, results {  width: 30em; margin: 1em auto; padding: 0.5em;  } searchForm fieldset { background: ddd; } edtSearch { width: 20em; padding: 0 0.2ex; } edtSearch:active, edtSearch:focus {  background: ffd; border: 2px solid black;  } results {  border: 1px solid green; background: dfd; color: 040;  } results ul { margin: 0; padding-left: 1em; } results li { font-family: monospace; } Now the server script and our stage will be ready for the star, Java- Script, to make its entrance: Download prototype ajax search1 server.rb  !  usr bin env ruby  require 'cgi' require 'erb' require 'webrick' include WEBrick  template_text = File.read 'results.rhtml'    STREAMLINING: AJAX.UPDATER  210  template = ERB.new template_text   server = HTTPServer.new :Port => 8042  server.mount ' ', HTTPServlet::FileHandler, '.'   def get_search_results q   suffix = " *{Regexp.escape q }*.rb" $LOAD_PATH.map { dir  Dir.glob dir + suffix, File::FNM_CASEFOLD .map { f  File.basename f, '.rb'   }  end  }.flatten.sort.uniq  server.mount_proc ' search'  do request, response  q = request.query['q']  '' results = get_search_results q  response['Content-Type'] = 'text html' response.body = template.result binding   trap 'INT'  { server.shutdown }  end  server.start  The get_search_results    method warrants some explanation. In these very few lines, we explore all the directories in which Ruby loads its standard libraries, grabbing for each one the list of Ruby ﬁles contain- ing our query text, regardless of case. The ﬁlenames are purged of their path part, leaving only the basename, with no extension.  The preliminary result is an array of arrays of names  one array per library directory . We ﬂatten it, sort, and remove potential duplicates. Our library name list is ready to be served!  There is, indeed, one last touch—the results template ﬁle, which is sim- ple enough:  Download prototype ajax search1 results.rhtml     No result found.             Sorry!          OK, now for the script. The idea is simple: intercept regular form sub- mission to route it through Ajax instead, and dump the response text   STREAMLINING: AJAX.UPDATER  211  Figure 9.4: Our initial view.

Here it is:  Download prototype ajax search1 search.js  function bindForm   {  $ 'searchForm' .observe 'submit', function e  {  e.stop  ; new Ajax.Updater 'results', this.action, {  method: 'get', parameters: this.serialize    } ;  } ;  }    bindForm  document.observe 'dom:loaded', bindForm ;  Yes, that’s all there is to it. You’ll have to ﬁnd another excuse to suck your client’s wallet dry. Now run the server script, and navigate to http:  localhost:8042. You should see the initial page, as in Figure 9.4.  Type in a query—say, “el”—and hit Return or activate the submission button. The page does not reload, but you should see results  or a no- results message, depending on your query  appear in the results zone, as in Figure 9.5, on the following page.   STREAMLINING: AJAX.UPDATER  212  Figure 9.5: Search results for “el”  That’s nice, isn’t it? I know, I know, you’ll want to play with it for a while. Suit yourself. Call the colleagues over and boast  wait a minute, hadn’t you done that an hour ago with the geometry thing? . Rejoice. Prototype is here, and life is good. Try submitting an empty search if you want to see all the libraries.  It’s time we look at the two new options Ajax.Updater has over Ajax. Requester yet. One of them is called evalScripts. Set to true, it will make sure any   tag in your returned fragment gets evaluated  once the rest of the fragment is present in the DOM . You see, by default, inline scripts are excised from your fragment, just in case. To make sure they’re evaluated, just turn on evalScripts. Note they will be run as JavaScript through eval     but you weren’t planning on burping out VBScript stuff, were you? .  Let’s add a bit of spice to our search view by initially hiding the search zone and have it roll down on the ﬁrst results display, shall we?   STREAMLINING: AJAX.UPDATER  213  We’ll just need to ﬁx the initial view so the results area has an inline style effectively masking it:      We also need to alter our template so that it now features, at the tail end of it, the inline script:    var results = $ 'results' ; if  !results.visible     new Effect.BlindDown results ;     And ﬁnally, we need to adjust the options set for our request so that scripts are evaluated:  new Ajax.Updater 'results', this.action, {  method: 'get', parameters: this.serialize  , evalScripts: true  } ;   STREAMLINING: AJAX.UPDATER  214  OK, stop your server, and then run it again  it needs to load the update template for the results . Refresh the view. You’ll note the results area is invisible at ﬁrst. Type a query, and trigger the search: the results appear using a “blind down” effect. Isn’t it nice?  There’s another option we can use now, the last one for updaters: inser- tion. So far, our fragments have replaced the contents of their container  using Element.update   , which we saw on page 139 . What if we need to aggregate successive fragments instead? For instance, we could want to keep a log of the searches we make, with the latest one on top. To do this, the insertion option lets you specify one of the Insertion objects, which we explored in Section 7.2, Inserting New Contents, on page 155.  It’s easy as pie. Let’s ﬁrst update our template so it now includes our query  because we’ll have multiple result sets, we might need to see which query yielded the results . We’ll also adjust the ﬁnal script so it triggers an effect on the whole results zone the ﬁrst time and then on the inserted fragment the next time:  Download prototype ajax search3 results.rhtml     " style="display: none;">   Results for &laquo; &raquo;:       No result found.  Sorry!                             var results = $ 'results' ; if  !results.visible    {  $ ' ' .show  ; new Effect.BlindDown results ;  } else     new Effect.BlindDown ' ' ;  Then we just need to adjust our script to use the proper option. We’ll go for latest on top, so we’ll use Insertion.Top:  new Ajax.Updater 'results', this.action, {  method: 'get', parameters: this.serialize  , evalScripts: true, insertion: 'top'  } ;   POLLING: AJAX.PERIODICALUPDATER  215  Again, stop and then restart your server and refresh your page. Then start making a few queries. . . . Does this rock or what? I mean, come on, we wrote a grand total of 110 lines of source code, including CSS and static HTML!  As a ﬁnal note, there is another nice feature I haven’t mentioned yet: the container option can be more than just an ID or DOM reference. Sometimes you need to differentiate between success and failure. You want to put the result somewhere in one case and somewhere else in the other case. Or maybe you don’t want to update anything on fail- ure. You just care about success. For both these situations, you can use an object for the container option, with at least a success property  identifying the container for successful requests  and possibly a failure property, too. This saves you the trouble of reverting to an Ajax.Request with a custom, tedious onComplete handler, for instance.  9.4 Polling: Ajax.PeriodicalUpdater  If you need periodical updating, the easiest way is to go with Ajax. PeriodicalUpdater. It’s not, properly speaking, a specialized version of Ajax.Updater, though. It’s a convenience object that uses a fresh Ajax. Updater periodically to save you the bother. And it also has a few more tricks.  Get It: Live Logged-In List To demonstrate this one, we’ll implement a simple application feature: a logged-in user list. You know, like the kind of list you’d want on a community portal’s home page or next to the transcript of a chat room. The server maintains a list of the active, or logged-in, users. The client page polls it now and then keeps the displayed list current. To keep things simple and DRY,9 we’ll use the same template for the list when it’s part of the full page and when it’s sent as an XHTML fragment.  Our server side will simulate a frequently changing user list. It features two URLs, one for the full page and one for the updated list only:  Download prototype ajax live_users server.rb  !  usr bin env ruby  require 'cgi' require 'erb'  9. So you Don’t Repeat Yourself...   POLLING: AJAX.PERIODICALUPDATER  216  require 'webrick' include WEBrick  full_template = ERB.new File.read 'index.rhtml'   list_template = ERB.new File.read 'users.rhtml'    server = HTTPServer.new :Port => 8042  server.mount ' ', HTTPServlet::FileHandler, '.'

So, the main template goes like this:  Download prototype ajax live_users index.rhtml  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">         Live logged-in users list               POLLING: AJAX.PERIODICALUPDATER  217      Live logged-in users list                And the list template goes like this:  Download prototype ajax live_users users.rhtml             The styling is very minimal, just so our example doesn’t look too bad:  Download prototype ajax live_users live.css  userList {  width: 15em; margin: 1em 0; padding: 0.25em; border: 1px solid navy; background: ddf; color: navy; list-style-type: none;  And because Ajax.PeriodicalUpdater ﬁts our need so well, the script remains concise:  Download prototype ajax live_users live.js  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  new Ajax.PeriodicalUpdater 'userList', ' users',  { method: 'get', frequency: 3 } ;  }  } ;  Because getting an updated list does not modify the application state  well, in our simulation it does, but in a real application it wouldn’t  and because we believe in REST and proper HTTP verb usage, we make sure to use a get request. We also use a new option, frequency, which states the interval, in seconds, between two updates.10  The default interval is two seconds, but I used three here as an exam- ple of using the option. Floating-point values are allowed, naturally. Remember that we use seconds here, not milliseconds.  10. Yes, it should have been called interval or, for the purists, period, because it’s actually the opposite of a frequency. I know.   POLLING: AJAX.PERIODICALUPDATER  218  OK, run the server, navigate to http:  localhost:8042 home, and keep looking. If you want to look under the hood, use Firefox and Firebug’s XHR monitoring. It just works!  Pure JavaScript? Consider the Alternative  When you return only pure JavaScript, having to provide a container that you will update with exactly zero text, since the script you wrapped in a   tag got stripped out for separate eval    processing, can sound a bit overkill, not to say cumbersome.  On the other hand, it’s very easy to do. Just put a dummy hidden   somewhere, or whatever. Still, for those of you who, like me, feel it’s not the right way to do, consider the marriage of a PeriodicalExe- cuter and a Ajax.Request, when you’d send the raw script back with the proper Content-Type header. There’s no noticeable workload difference, but it’s certainly less roundabout.  A Few More Tricks Up Your Sleeve Besides its frequency option, Ajax.PeriodicalUpdater also features a rather advanced option called decay. Sometimes, the longer a result stays unchanged, the less often you want to check. In such situations, setting decay to values greater than 1  its default  will do the trick nicely.  Here is the idea: whenever the response text changes from the last time  which obviously happens on the ﬁrst request, at any rate , the next request is scheduled frequency seconds later. But every time the response comes back unchanged, the scheduling is multiplied by decay. Incidentally, this means decay values less than 1 result in ever- quickening checks, which will quickly saturate the browser  ouch! .  The ofﬁcial API page at http:  prototypejs.org api ajax periodicalUpdater has a nice table illustrating how decay impacts the scheduling of suc- cessive requests. Check it out for further details. But remember, this is for slightly edge cases. Most of the time, you’re good to go without needing it.  Also know that you can stop, and later resume, the scheduling of re- quests. The methods stop    and start    are there just for this. This comes in handy when you provide your user with a way to toggle a particular periodical behavior on the ﬂy. By the way, the onComplete callback has different semantics here. It doesn’t ﬁre on every Ajax request, but when the periodical update system “completes,” which means it stops, it will   MONITORING AJAX ACTIVITY: AJAX.RESPONDERS  219  get called only, therefore, when if you call stop     which you may call from within the update function to terminate periodical update based on “internal,” business-oriented rules .  9.5 Monitoring Ajax Activity: Ajax.Responders  When doing Ajax, something we often need to do is monitor Ajax activ- ity globally for all requests happening in our page. The most common reason for this is to maintain a status indicator  often the famous “spin- ner”  that is visible while at least one Ajax request is going on, hiding it when the last live one is over. Such indicators are helpful in setting the user’s expectations.  The easiest way to go about this is to use the global Ajax.Responders object. This object gets notiﬁed about every life cycle event of every request made by the Ajax.* objects. It has all the usual callbacks.  The two methods you’ll be interested in are register    and unregister     mostly the ﬁrst one . You simply pass a listener object—something with all the callbacks you need. Prototype uses such a listener to main- tain Ajax.activeRequestCount, which, nicely enough, tells you how many requests are going on at any given time.  Assuming you have something in your page like this  along with proper styling, probably :     . . . making this indicator systematically visible while Ajax is going on would be as simple as this:  Ajax.Responders.register {  onCreate: function   { $ 'spinner' .show  ; }, onComplete: function   {  if  0 == Ajax.activeRequestCount   $ 'spinner' .hide  ;  } } ;  Nice and easy. . . .  9.6 Debugging Ajax  When you’re doing Ajax work, it can quickly become frustrating not to see what’s sent and what’s received as a response. The tiniest glitch   AJAX CONSIDERED HARMFUL? THINKING ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY AND ERGONOMY  220  can ruin the proper behavior of your app, and with no peek into the Ajax exchange, you’re left waving your hands in the dark.  Some people take out the pile hammer and ﬁre up network sniffers like Ethereal  renamed Wireshark in 2006 . I ﬁnd this approach extremely cumbersome, not to mention that it slows the whole thing down. Tools such as these are so powerful that they become quite unwieldy, and we’re more the agile crowd anyway.  Once again, Firebug to the rescue! It features a Show XMLHttpRequests option for its console that lets you track what’s going on. We already saw such tracking in action on Figure 9.3, on page 200, for instance. This is, really, your best bet. Of course, if your Ajax works just ﬁne on Firefox but is buggy on another browser, you’ll have to ﬁnd something else.  As far as I know, easy Ajax tracing is not in tools such as the Internet Explorer Developer Toolbar, and it is not featured by Opera or Safari, to name only those. So, selective network snifﬁng might be your only choice. But remember that if you get your Ajax request right on one browser  say, Firefox , chances are breakage in other browsers is more of a JavaScript or DOM issue. Standard debugging tools, especially JavaScript debuggers, are likely to be the help you need then.  9.7 Ajax Considered Harmful? Thinking About Accessibility and  Ergonomy  Before we move ahead, I would very much like to talk a bit about acces- sibility, not only pertaining to Ajax but also to JavaScript more gen- erally. This falls a bit outside the scope of this book, so I’ll try to be concise yet useful.  Most people think accessibility and scripting  especially Ajax  are intrin- sically not reconcilable. This is patently untrue. As with most things, best practices go a long way toward having your cake and eating it. There is no titanic effort here—just proper habits to make yours.  Not Using JavaScript? No Problem! Unless you are working on an intranet-style application where you have control over the browsers, you cannot always afford to require JavaScript. Except perhaps for applications where JavaScript-powered features are key to your product’s value  such as most 37signals appli- cations, one could argue , JavaScript should always be used to improve   AJAX CONSIDERED HARMFUL? THINKING ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY AND ERGONOMY  221  usability, not to implement it. A classic example is providing navigation  or other important actions  only through clicks over otherwise passive elements  such as images or   elements . With no JavaScript, your elements are inert. Functionality is lost.  Having no JavaScript at hand is more frequent than you think. A lot of mobile users  using phones, PDAs, and so on  or those equipped with alternative browsing systems  such as a screen reader  still have no JavaScript or have a very limited implementation of it. JavaScript could also be technically available but be disabled by a stringent system administrator.  Even if JavaScript is there and enabled, requiring complex manipu- lations from your users is inaccessible. Many cannot use a pointing device  for example, a mouse  with good precision, or cannot wield one at all, because of some motor handicap; they may also ﬁnd it difﬁcult to press complex keyboard shortcuts. Even with no handicap, many may use a browsing device with a limited or absent keyboard  think mobile phones or PDAs  and possibly no efﬁcient pointing mechanism. On the whole, people with one form of handicap or another  cognitive, visual, motor, and so on  make up more than 15% of web users, which means tens of millions of people worldwide. You can’t just exclude them.  The key to better accessibility here is to embrace unobtrusive Java- Script. Have your page work  even if not too fabulously from a usability standpoint  with no script whatsoever  ideally, with no CSS whatso- ever! , and then use separate scripting to hook into regular events  for example, form submission, link activation  to make it behave in a more comfortable way, saving the user’s time and effort. Starting with bare- bones stuff and progressively applying feature augmentations through JavaScript and Ajax, in an unobtrusive way, is referred to as progres- sive enhancement.  Ergonomical Ajax: Taking the Right Approach What’s true for JavaScript obviously still stands for Ajax. Jeremy Keith, of DOM Scripting fame, refers to progressive enhancement through Ajax as Hijax.11 Yet Ajax accessibility is not just about technical availability and graceful degradation. On the Web, users have a different set of expectations than they do on “desktop” applications.  Most people still expect a web page not to behave quite like a regular application screen. They’re not quite alert to your page doing requests  11. http:  domscripting.com blog display 41   AJAX CONSIDERED HARMFUL? THINKING ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY AND ERGONOMY  222  in the background, changing fragments of its contents on the ﬂy, allow- ing drag and drop of elements, and the like. You’ll have to make all this very explicit for them so they don’t get confused.  Sometimes using Ajax doesn’t make sense at all from an ergonomi- cal standpoint. It messes with browser history, and most users are very fond of their Back buttons. Using Ajax to go from one step of a process to another does not alter the history, and improper usage of the Back feature can yield all sorts of issues, not to mention such states are not automatically bookmarkable. You’d need to provide cus- tom URLs for those  think Google Maps . Another common mistake is to autosend forms as they’re ﬁlled in, which is not always proper. Some forms should wait for manual submission, if only to let the user change their mind, go back and ﬁnish later, cancel the process, and so on.  Here are a few ground rules, tips, and tricks you can use to make your shiny, wizardy pages more accessible:    If your site is public-facing, state clearly right from the home page that you use Ajax and JavaScript. Link to a small page that describes, in simple, clear copy, why you use them and what ergonomical expectations the user should have because of this. Setting expectations is a simple but critical thing.    Doing Ajax? Make sure there’s a visible indicator of it  for example, the famous spinner12 . If this means the user should not manipu- late parts of your UI, don’t let them try. Disable the relevant parts during the Ajax processing.    Using drag and drop? Make it obvious! Use a small text hint or perhaps small icons when the mouse is over a draggable element. For instance, to-do lists in 37signals’ products use the second approach, as illustrated in Figure 9.6, on the following page.    Reloading a small part of a page? Make sure the user notices: use a highlight effect, and perhaps play a sound. The fragment might not be visible at this moment because of its viewport size and scrolling issues.    Doing periodical updates? The extra mile would be to let users turn that into manual triggering, which helps people with screen readers or cognitive handicaps. In the same vein, letting such users request an actual message box  think alert   , which screen  12. Need one?

The extreme case here is to let them toggle Ajax off entirely for your page, reverting to vanilla, manual, full-page reloading.  What We Just Learned  Ajax is a core skill for Web 2.0 development, and Prototype provides a hell of a lot in this regard. Let’s brieﬂy review what we saw in this chapter:    First, we saw how Ajax was not always the best solution for the problem: it could degrade ease of use instead of improving it. Ajax- ifying a page should always be done with great care and be thor- oughly tested in various performance and accessibility contexts.    Prototype’s Ajax features are entirely based on one class: Ajax. Request. Make sure you understand it well and know all its fea- tures.    Synchronous requests  sometimes dubbed SJAX  should be avoi- ded at all costs. They’re most likely to freeze the browser, effec- tively defeating, in a big way, the purpose of Ajax.    JSON should be your preferred format for data-only exchanges. Just forget XML. It’s too much of a bother to parse on the client side, and it’s verbose and hence bandwidth-heavy.    Whenever possible, prefer the hash form of the parameters option to its predigested query string variant. The object form is easier to tweak and maintain.    Prototype emulates HTTP verbs outside of get and post by revert-  ing to post and using an extra _method ﬁeld in the request.    You should not rely on nonguaranteed, intermediate-state call-  backs.   AJAX CONSIDERED HARMFUL? THINKING ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY AND ERGONOMY  224    The Ajax.Response object passed as the ﬁrst argument to the call- backs is the gateway to all the response lookups and examina- tion you might need. It automatically parses JavaScript and JSON results.    Ajax.Updater is perfect for the common use case of an Ajax request returning a document fragment and can handle different updated locations depending on the response’s error state  based on HTTP response codes . It can also insert the new fragment instead of replacing an existing one with it.    When your periodical Ajax requests do not return a fragment but pure JavaScript, you’ll probably be better off with a PeriodicalExe- cuter over regular Ajax.Request objects.    Ajax.Responders lets you implement global callbacks that are trig- gered for all your requests. It’s especially useful for global visual indicators and centralized processing  such as logging and error reporting .  Neuron Workout  Ready to gear up? Start with these small assignments:    What’s the best way to return a document fragment on which  scripting must be applied?    Say you use Ajax to add items to a task list. Each task item con- tains a checkbox, and you need to react to that checkbox being clicked to put the item in the “pending” or “done” list. The easiest solution does not use inline   tags in your Ajax responses and is more efﬁcient to boot. What is it?    Create a sign-up form that reacts to the user typing a login by live- checking whether that login is available; if it’s not, it styles the ﬁeld accordingly, displays a message, and disables the submit button. If it is available, it does the opposite. Use a simple server-side script in whatever language you like, with a static list of already- taken logins, to help you test it. Also make sure the lookup interval is not so small it hogs the browser.   Chapter 10 More Useful Helper Objects  Prototype dazzles with all the shiny new stuff we saw, but there’s more yet to marvel at. Hashes, value ranges, periodical yet nonreentrant code execution, string templating, and browser features—these may be less important than, say, collections, DOM manipulation, events handling, and Ajax, but they sure can come in handy.  10.1 Storing Values in a Hash  Hash was completely rewritten for Prototype 1.6. If you used it in previ- ous versions, pay special attention!  Many languages feature an associative array type. You know, it has some unique keys, which can be just about anything and are associated with values. It’s common  and just about indispensable  in scripting languages such as PHP, Perl, or Ruby, and it can also be found in libraries tied to more static languages such as Java  think java.util.Map  or C++  think std::map . Prototype just calls them hashes and offers a Hash type.  JavaScript makes hashes really easy. Any object can be treated as a hash. It is inherently possible to iterate through an object’s properties  using the for. . . in loop , add and remove properties to an object, change property values, and so on. Properties are also intrinsically unique. But then, you may ask, if objects make such great hashes as it is, why would we need a speciﬁc Hash type? Good question, my dear, astute reader.   STORING VALUES IN A HASH  226  Well, Hash exists to wrap this basic behavior with a few layers of nice features, such as being able to mix Enumerable in, easily fetching keys or values, merging hashes, and converting to a query string  which comes in handy more often than you may think .  Creating a Hash $H  [obj]  → Hash new Hash  [obj]  → Hash  We already saw one way to create a hash: the $H    utility function, described in Section 3.7, $H Makes a Hash of Things, on page 50. The other way is to use a vanilla class creation syntax such as new Hash   or, if you need to start with a given set of properties and values, new Hash basicObject . Both syntaxes are absolutely equivalent and always return a fresh, new object.  Hash Maintenance: Tinkering with Keys and Values Now that we have a hash in our hands, what can we do with it? Well, we want to store, fetch, and remove associations in there. That’s what the accessor methods are for.  get propName  → propValue set propName, propValue  → samePropValue unset propName  → propValue  The names of these methods are rather self-explanatory: set    lets you create or replace an association in the hash, get    lets you fetch it  and returns, quite naturally, undeﬁned if the association does not exist , and unset    makes sure an association is not there anymore, returning the former association’s value, if any.  Note that set    returns the new value, not the old one  in the same spirit as JavaScript assignment . This lets you reuse the call in an assignment or method call, as in if  h.set ’blah’, value   or v = h.set ’blah’, value  + 42. . . .  If you need to do more powerful stuff, it’s either Prototype’s way or the hard way. Here’s what becomes available with our beloved library:  each iterator  → Hash index value  → firstKey keys   → Array merge obj  → newHash update obj  → Hash values   → Array   STORING VALUES IN A HASH  227  Before we explore these, remember that Hash mixes Enumerable in. Beware, though—the results you’ll get are, still, expressed as arrays, not “subhashes.” In this regard, this is not exactly like mixins in Ruby.  I mentioned the each    method in the method list because you may want to know in what order the iteration proceeds. The answer is, quite simply, that depends. It relies on JavaScript’s native for...in loop, which means the iteration order is mostly browser-dependent  ECMA- 262 clearly states that “an Object is an unordered collection of proper- ties” . So, you should not rely on a speciﬁc order for your algorithms to work.  Also note that the ﬁrst argument to your iterator is actually a pair object, with two properties: key and value. It also behaves as an array, with the name at index 0 and the value at index 1, exposing it to all native and extra methods for Array. You thus iterate on map entries, not on map keys.  Here’s a short example:  Download prototype new hash_each.js  var lib = $H { version: 1.5, author: 'Sam Stephenson' } ; lib.each function pair  {  alert pair.key + ' = "' + pair.value + '"' ;  } ;    Alerts, in non-guaranteed order, 'version = "1.5"' and    'author = "Sam Stephenson"'.  Hashes let you get a list of the keys or values, also ordered based on the native for...in loop. Since these are returned as arrays, they’re enu- merable as well, which is rather handy.  You can decide to merge two hashes by using merge   . The idea is that the hash you’re calling merge    on has lower priority than the one passed as an argument. When the merge is done, you get a new hash that has all properties from both, with the argument’s values when there is a property name conﬂict.  Note that the argument doesn’t need to be a Hash. It will get passed to $H    prior to use. If you do not want a new hash object but want to update the original hash, use update    instead of merge   .  Finally, you can get the ﬁrst key  in native iteration order  associated with a given value by using the index    method.   STORING VALUES IN A HASH  228  A combined example should help:  Download prototype new hash_tinkering.js  Line 1  var lib = $H { name: 'Prototype', version: 1.5 } ; lib.keys  .sort      -> ['name', 'version'] lib.values  .sort      -> [1.5, 'Prototype']  lib.update { version: '1.5.1', author: 'sam' } ; lib.invoke 'join', ' = ' .sort  .join ', '     -> 'author = sam, name = Prototype, version = 1.5.1'  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  lib.index 'sam'     -> 'author'  lib.unset 'author'     -> 'sam'  lib.keys  .sort      -> ['name',' version']  $H  .keys      -> []  You may be puzzled by the nifty trick on line 8:  lib.invoke 'join', ' = ' .sort  .join ', '   Here’s how it works:  1. First, remember that on hashes, each    iterates over key value pairs, which are, ﬁrst and foremost, arrays. The ﬁrst element is the key name, and the second is the value.  2. So when we call invoke    here, we actually produce an array based on the hash, with one string representation per original key value pair, which has the form key = value.  3. Next, we sort the resulting array and produce a unique string out of it with the native join    method, using a comma and a space between each property representation.  This is the kind of line that makes me love Prototype. It just makes me feel warm and fuzzy. JavaScript is cool again.  Looking at Our Hash and Turning It into Something Else There’s little left to say about Hash. It’s mostly about converting hashes to string representations. We’ve got two of those: debug-oriented form and URL-like serialization.   STORING VALUES IN A HASH  229  inspect   → String toObject toTemplateReplacements   → Object toQueryString   → String  We already covered inspect    many times. In the case of Hash, it provides a fully custom representation, as shown in the next code example, a few paragraphs down.  If you need raw access to the storage container for the associations, you can use the toObject    converter. It will likely mostly be used through its toTemplateReplacements    alias in order to use a Hash as any regular object in the context of templating, which we’ll discuss in Section 10.4, Templating Made Easy, on page 233.  Another common use of hashes is to structure parameters later used for an HTTP request  either directly or, more often, through Ajax . We then need to serialize these properties as parameters in a URI-encoded way  indeed, be it a GET or a POST request, the default format for data is URL-encoding . You can do this on existing Hash instances by simply invoking toQueryString    on them, or reuse the algorithm for any Java- Script object by passing them as arguments to Object.toQueryString   .  Here are a few details on the serialization process: properties whose value is undeﬁned are serialized without value  just their name , prop- erties with value null are deemed empty, properties with Array values get serialized once per array element, and all names and values obviously get encoded using JavaScript’s native encodeURIComponent    method. The order is, as always with Hash, dependent on the native for...in loop.  Incidentally, note that toQueryString    is essentially reciprocal to String’s parseQuery    method, which we covered earlier in Section 4.5, Convert- ing and Extracting: toQueryParams, parseQuery, toArray, and inspect, on page 75.  It’s time for an example, wouldn’t you say?  Download prototype new hash_strings.js  $H { name: 'Prototype', version: 1.5 } .inspect      -> " "    Order not guaranteed  $H { action: 'ship', order_id: 123, fees: ['f1', 'f2'],  'label': 'a demo' } .toQueryString       -> 'action=ship&order_id=123&fees=f1&fees=f2&label=a%20demo'  $H  .toQueryString      -> ''   EXPRESSING RANGES OF. . . WELL, ANYTHING YOU WANT!  230     "Class method" variant on any object: use the Object namespace instead. Object.toQueryString { foo:'bar' }     -> 'foo=bar'  And that’s it for hashes. Simple fellas, really. They’re nifty without too much overhead. You’ve got to like them.  10.2 Expressing Ranges of. . . Well, Anything You Want!  Talking about nice simple guys, meet ObjectRange. This is the class behind the $R    utility function, which we saw in Section 3.8, Handling Ranges with $R, on page 50. This class simply represents a range of values, which can be of any type amenable to ranges. OK, so what exactly makes a type amenable to ranges?  Well, in short, it just has to have a succ    method. When you call it on a value, you get the next value. That’s it. Prototype puts such a method in Number and String, so out of the box, you can have number ranges and string ranges. The former is actually much more used  and useful  than the latter.  Ranges mix in Enumerable, which is the salient point about them. It lets you iterate easily, slap them on existing sequences with methods such as zip   , or easily convert them to an array  since Enumerable provides ranges with a generic implementation of toArray    .  Creating Ranges Oh, that’s a walk in the park:  $R start, end [, exclusive= false]  new ObjectRange start, end [, exclusive= false]   For once, there is absolutely no distinction whatsoever between the utility function and its vanilla constructor counterpart. They share the same semantics.  Range Iteration Ranges iterate from the start value to the end value, calling succ    on the current value to get the next one. If the exclusive parameter is set to true, the end value is skipped; the iteration will stop right before it.   PERIODICAL EXECUTION WITHOUT RISK OF REENTRANCE  231  Have a look at this:  Download prototype new range_combined.js  $A $R 1, 5  .join ', '     -> '1, 2, 3, 4, 5'  $R 1, 5 .zip ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five'], function tuple  {  return tuple.join ' = ' ;  }     -> ['1 = one', '2 = two', '3 = three', '4 = four', '5 = five']  $A $R 'a', 'e'      -> ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'], no surprise there  $A $R 'ax', 'ba'      -> Ouch! Humongous array, starting as     ['ax', 'ay', 'az', 'a{', 'a', 'a}', 'a~'...]  Beware of String-based ranges. As described on page 69, the succ    method does not stop with alphabetical boundaries  which would be infeasible in an internationalized context  but goes all the way across the character table, which, in JavaScript, is Unicode .  Range Inclusion Ranges come with only one speciﬁc method:  include value  → Boolean  This is pretty self-explanatory. It tells you whether the value is included in the range  taking the exclusive initialization parameter into account, obviously . Note, however, that this relies on the existence of a < oper- ator between values of the range. This is likely not to work so well on custom value objects that feature just the succ    method. . . .  10.3 Periodical Execution Without Risk of Reentrance  Sometimes you need to periodically call a function. Maybe you need to poll the server for updates, maybe you’re doing some autosave feature, or maybe you’re dealing with some time-related UI effect and haven’t found a suitable treat in libraries such as script.aculo.us or the Proto- type Window Class.1 You just want the periodical call thing.  1. http:  prototype-window.xilinus.com   PERIODICAL EXECUTION WITHOUT RISK OF REENTRANCE  232  This could easily be achieved with the native setInterval    and clearInter- val    methods on the window object, but this has several drawbacks:    This requires you to take care of the nitty-gritty details of timer handles yourself, which essentially means you’re going to either pollute the global namespace or create your own namespace-like object to hold it.    This does not prevent you from getting your callback function called while its prior call is still processing, which can be annoying if it deals with UI interaction  for example, a prompt   , conﬁrm   , or custom dialog call for the user to deal with .  With PeriodicalUpdater, you get the following beneﬁts:    Your callback function never gets called again while it is still pro-  cessing; there’s an internal ﬂag preventing double calling.    It encapsulates the timer handling mechanism into a neat object.   You can stop the periodical execution at any time by calling the  stop    method on the periodical executer object.  new PeriodicalExecuter callback, intervalInSecs  → PeriodicalExecuter pe.stop    Note that your callback will get called with the PeriodicalExecuter object as its argument  letting you stop it from inside the function  and that the interval is expressed in seconds  obviously, you can use a ﬂoating- point value, such as 0.75 .  Just look at this example code:  Download prototype new periodicalExecuter.js     Campfire style :-  new PeriodicalExecuter pollChatRoom, 3 ;  new PeriodicalExecuter function pe  {  if  !confirm 'Want me to annoy you again later?'    pe.stop  ;  }, 5 ;    Note that there won't be a stack of such messages if the user takes    too long answering to the question...  var gCallCount = 0; new PeriodicalExecuter function pe  {  if  ++gCallCount > 3   pe.stop  ;  else  alert gCallCount ;  }, 1 ;    Will only alert 1, 2 and 3, then the PE stops.   10.4 Templating Made Easy  TEMPLATING MADE EASY  233  Prototype 1.5 introduced a new object dedicated to template-based string creation: Template. It lets you pluck properties from an object and insert them in a template string. It’s also useful when you have a group of similar objects and you need to produce formatted output for these objects, maybe inside a loop.  You would then typically resort to concatenating string literals with the object’s ﬁelds. There’s nothing wrong with the previous approach, except that it is hard to visualize the output immediately just by glanc- ing at the concatenation expression.  The Template class provides a much nicer and clearer way of achieving this formatting:  new Template templateText [, pattern = Template.Pattern]  → Template template.evaluate scopeObject  → String  By default, the template syntax used by Template is akin to Ruby’s string syntax. You can embed ﬁelds from the scope object with a {ﬁeld- Name} fragment. Because arrays have numerical properties, you can use this syntax for vanilla arrays as well, using {0} for the ﬁrst ele- ment, {1} for the second one, and so forth. Here’s a ﬁrst example:  Download prototype new template_simple.js  var people = [  { name: 'Élodie Jaubert', field: 'Heritage management',  { name: 'Seth Dillingham', field: 'Web development',  role: 'my fiancée' },  role: 'a fellow Core' }  ]; var tpl = new Template '{name} works in {field} and is {role}.' ;  people.each function person  { alert tpl.evaluate person  ;  }    Alerts    "Seth Dillingham works in Web development and is a fellow Core.",    then "Élodie Jaubert works in Heritage management and is my fiancée."  Since Prototype 1.6, you can actually use more advanced syntax in expansion blocks  the {...} thing . You’re not limited to a ﬁeld name anymore but can walk down the properties using dot notation  a.b  or square bracket indexing  a[b] . In this second case, however, quotes for the key are not only unnecessary but will be handled literally.   TEMPLATING MADE EASY  234  Here are a few examples:  Download prototype new template_advanced.js  var people = [  { name: 'Élodie Jaubert',  { name: 'Seth Dillingham' }  ]; var tpl = new Template   interests: [ 'heritage', 'culture', 'music' ] },  '{length} people. {0.name} likes {0.interests[2], ' + 'among other things.' ;  tpl.evaluate people     => '2 people.    You can use [] or . indifferently, except when the prop name is    empty or contains a dot: then you need the square brackets.  Élodie likes music, among other things.'  Prototype also caters to the few use cases where the scope object for your templating is not exactly what you’d like. Perhaps it provides some information you need through a method instead of a property, for instance. For these cases, you can equip your object with a to- TemplateReplacements    method, which should return an alternate rep- resentation of your object, that will be used for the templating. Consider the following:  Download prototype new template_ttr.js  var student = { name: 'John', grades: [10, 12, 13.5, 8, 16],  average: function   {  this.grades.length;  return this.grades.inject 0, function acc, g  { return acc + g }     }, highest: function   { return this.grades.max  ; }, lowest: function   { return this.grades.min  ; },  toTemplateReplacements: function   {  var result = Object.clone this , student = this; ['average', 'highest', 'lowest'].each function methodName  {  result[methodName] = student[methodName]  ;  } ; return result;  }  };  var tpl = new Template   '{name} averages at {average}  lowest: {lowest} ' ;  tpl.evaluate student ;    => 'John averages at 11.9  lowest: 8 '   TEMPLATING MADE EASY  235  Finally, note that you can use the reserved {...} syntax as a literal by simply escaping the ﬁrst character: \{...}. This is actually not an abso- lute truth, because it depends on the template pattern being properly deﬁned.  Indeed, if you look closely at the syntax block I used for the Template constructor, you notice that there is a second, optional pattern argu- ment, which defaults to Template.Pattern. What is that? Well, quite sim- ply, this is a regular expression used to search the template text for dynamic fragments and “parse” those fragments in order to provide the templating engine with proper information.  The default pattern, Template.Pattern, looks like this:    ∧.\r\n  \{ .*? \}    To better understand it, you need to know that a valid template pattern must identify at least three groups, which is done using paired paren- theses:    The character, or anchor, positioned immediately before the dyna- mic fragment. This is used to detect backslash escaping  yes, it has to be a backslash . This part of the template never needs to change. It’s  ∧.\r\n .    The full dynamic fragment, including its opening and closing de- limiters; the default pattern uses  \{ .*? \}   recall that curly braces, square brackets, and parentheses, among other charac- ters, are special characters in JavaScript’s regular expressions. To use them as literals, you must escape them, which is why we use \{ and \} here .    The property name part, which is the dynamic fragment stripped  of its delimiters. This part seldom changes and is generally  .*? .  So if you insist on using another template syntax, you can provide your own pattern. Say you’ve sloshed too long in the swamps of ASP to easily shed the   syntax. You can cater to this sorry need by using the appropriate pattern:  Download prototype new template_custom.js  var people = [  { name: 'Bill Gates', style: 'ASP' }, { name: 'Andrew Dupont', style: 'Ruby' }  ];  var ASP_SYNTAX =   ^.\r\n     ;   EXAMINING THE CURRENT BROWSER AND PROTOTYPE LIBRARY  236  var tpl = new Template '  prefers   syntax.',  ASP_SYNTAX ;  people.each function person  { alert tpl.evaluate person  ;  } ;    Alerts "Bill Gates prefers ASP syntax.",    then "Andrew Dupont prefers Ruby syntax."  10.5 Examining the Current Browser and Prototype Library  Before taking on the real gem  Enumerable , let’s start at an easy loping pace with Prototype. This is actually a namespace. Remember names- paces? We discussed them in Section 2.4, Objects, Namespaces, and Modules, on page 37. Quite simply, Prototype is not for instantiation. It is just a named repository for several methods and pseudoconstants. This is where you get information about the version of your Prototype library, details about browser support for speciﬁc features, and generic iterators that might come in handy now and then.  Version Information Any Prototype library lets you access its exact version through Proto- type.Version. It is a full version string, such as 1.5.1 or 1.6.0_pre0. It is especially useful when you are writing a library based on Prototype and need to test for dependency upon a speciﬁc minimum version.  For instance, script.aculo.us  which we will explore in the next part of this book  checks that it is run based upon a sufﬁciently recent version of Prototype  on which it depends entirely  in its scriptaculous.js ﬁle with code like this:  Download prototype new prototype_version.js     Extracted from script.aculo.us 1.8.0 if  typeof Prototype=='undefined'    typeof Element == 'undefined'    typeof Element.Methods=='undefined'    convertVersionString Prototype.Version  <  convertVersionString Scriptaculous.REQUIRED_PROTOTYPE     throw "script.aculo.us requires the Prototype JavaScript framework >= " +  Scriptaculous.REQUIRED_PROTOTYPE ;  Incidentally, know that Prototype follows a rather usual version naming scheme:    The earliest stages of a given version are preversions and use an  incremental _pre sufﬁx  for example, _pre0 .   EXAMINING THE CURRENT BROWSER AND PROTOTYPE LIBRARY  237    Getting close to release, we go Release Candidate, with incremen- tal _rc sufﬁxes. For instance, the last stage of Prototype before 1.5 was 1.5.0_rc2.    Finally, public releases have no sufﬁx  but three numbers still .  So far, prereleases and release candidates were available only through the Subversion repository  and embedded in script.aculo.us . This strategy may well change now that the ofﬁcial site has been fully re- vamped, though. Keep an eye on the download page,2 but remember, such releases are mostly for testing and playing around with upcom- ing features. They can have failing tests, performance issues, unstable parts, and the like.  Browser Features Whenever Prototype ﬁnds itself in repetitive need of a given browser feature detection, it ends up detecting it once and for all and putting the result in the Prototype.BrowserFeatures namespace. There are currently three aspects in there, all of which are booleans:  XPath  ElementExtensions  Whether the browser supports DOM Level 3 XPath, which is used for tremendously boosting several DOM retrievals  such as $$    and select    .  Whether the browser provides JavaScript prototypes for DOM ele- ments, enabling direct extension. This speeds up the whole DOM extension mechanism and therefore speeds up Prototype code in general. See Chapter 7, Playing with the DOM Is Finally Fun!, on page 130 for the whole story.  SpeciﬁcElementExtensions  Whether the browser uses a common prototype for all DOM ele- ments  as Safari seems to do at the time of this writing . When this is the case, the DOM extension mechanism compensates accord- ingly to perform direct extension anyway.  Browsers  Firefox, Safari, and So On  You will also ﬁnd a Prototype.Browser namespace, which holds boolean constants for most major browsers or rendering engines, letting your  2. http:  prototypejs.org download   EXAMINING THE CURRENT BROWSER AND PROTOTYPE LIBRARY  238  script detect the current browser in a legible, concise way. At this point, the following booleans are deﬁned in it: IE, Opera, WebKitMobileSafari  which basically means the iPhone or the iPod Touch , and Gecko.  As you can see, this is so far pretty much for internal use, although I can certainly imagine Prototype “add-ons” leveraging this information for better integration. At any rate, more browser-related information may well come up in later releases, such as browser identiﬁcation, SVG support, and   support. . . . So keep a sharp eye out!  Querying the Current Viewport Sometimes we need to get the dimensions of the viewport itself, not the browser window. The viewport, as you probably know, is the render- ing surface for the document. It is what’s left in the window once we put in the menus, toolbars, scroll bars, status bars, and so on. This surface is much more interesting to us, for our scripts, than the win- dow’s dimensions, especially since the relation between viewport size and window size varies depending on the amount of “chrome”  UI com- ponents  present.  Starting with Prototype 1.6, a new object is maintained, called docu- ment.viewport, equipped with four neat methods:  1.6  document.viewport.getDimensions   → { width: Number, height: Number } document.viewport.getHeight   → Number document.viewport.getWidth   → Number document.viewport.getScrollOffsets   → { left: Number, top: Number }  The signatures are pretty much self-explanatory. As a reminder, scroll offsets are the shifting operated by the scroll bars  which means, inci- dentally, that they’re never negative .  Boilerplate Functions To make most iterator arguments optional in Enumerable’s methods, Prototype deﬁnes an “identity” iterator, which is a function that simply returns its ﬁrst argument, untouched. It’s called Prototype.K   . Take the min    method, for instance; you can call it either with no argument  in which case it will compare the elements directly  or with an iterator of yours  which will be used to compute the values then being compared . Thanks to Prototype.K   , the code for this alternative is pretty simple:  value =  iterator  Prototype.K  value, index ;  Another area for boilerplate functions is Prototype’s Ajax requesters. These offer a variety of callback hooks to let your code react to the   EXAMINING THE CURRENT BROWSER AND PROTOTYPE LIBRARY  239  many phases of an Ajax communication  including errors and spe- ciﬁc types of successful responses . In order not to bother with an if test of the presence of a given callback, the code just reverts to an empty function  a function that, literally, does nothing at all : Proto- type.emptyFunction     note the lowercase e . Here is a line from Proto- type’s Ajax state-handling code:   this.options['on' + state]  Prototype.emptyFunction  transport, json ;  You might ﬁnd yourself needing such functions to simplify your code or allow for optional function-typed arguments in your methods.  What We Just Learned  Although less prominent, the features in this chapter do help make our code efforts easier. We should especially remember that. . .    Hash provides a few methods to explicitly process a regular object as a hash, mostly by looking at its keys and values as datasets and enumerating on them. It also features a nice inspect   , when regular objects would spew out some unusable string such as “[Object].”    Hashes also provide the URL-encoding and decoding facilities in  Prototype.    Ranges are mostly used to represent integer ranges, such as $R 1, 100 , and are useful in conjunction with many Enumerable oper- ations  for instance, we can use them to index items in another enumeration, perhaps using a zip    call . But essentially anything with a succ    method is range-compatible, so there can be some pretty creative uses out there.    The Template class provides a robust, simple templating mecha- nism to inject object properties, however complex, into a text pat- tern. Remember that one-shot templating is easier to do with a call to String’s interpolate   , too.    The Prototype library itself can be “inspected” by using the Proto- type namespace to get the library’s version and look at the run- ning browser’s type and behavioral capabilities  such as XPath support .    With Prototype 1.6, you now get support for viewport information,  letting you know how big it is and how far it’s being scrolled.   EXAMINING THE CURRENT BROWSER AND PROTOTYPE LIBRARY  240  Neuron Workout  Here are a few suggestions for bite-size code snippets to ﬁddle with:    Produce a sorted list of all the properties in an object.    Reduce it to methods only.    Reduce it instead to nonmethod properties that are strings and  whose names begin with a vowel.    Change Stringsucc    so it wraps at the end of the ASCII alpha- bet; for example, "wiz".succ   yields "wja" instead of "wi{". Check out $A $R ’abc’, ’bzz’   then.    If necessary, adjust it to wrap over from 9 to 0, and from Z to A,  too.  And that’s a wrap! We’ve gone through all that Prototype has to offer. Before moving over to script.aculo.us, I’ll just remind you of a few per- formance issues in the next chapter, just so you don’t fall prey to unex- pected sluggishness.   There is nothing so useless as doing efﬁciently that which should not be done at all.  Peter F. Drucker  Chapter 11 Performance Considerations  11.1 Element Extension and the $ Function  If you’re running on a browser that does not feature native DOM ele- ment prototypes  for example, Internet Explorer , extending elements unnecessarily can have some performance impact. Such extensions are not always easy to spot in your code. A lot of Prototype methods auto- matically extend their arguments, for instance, or the elements they return. Just look at all the calls to $    in the source.  Still, in most cases this is not a real issue. Here are the two main reasons why:    Element extension happens at most once per element. Attempting to extend an already extended element has a much lower cost  basically, just the function call cost .    Element extension is, in itself, not a complex process. It mostly means copying a bunch of properties from one object to the ele- ment. To become noticeable from a user’s perspective, it would have to operate on hundreds, if not thousands, of unextended ele- ments.  If you really need to work over a vast amount of elements without extending all of them, you can still revert to a regular loop over these elements, and either use a namespaced syntax when calling “extended” methods on them  for example, Element.hide elt   or extend only those you’re interested in  by manually calling Element.extend    on them .  On the other hand, many Prototype features will automatically extend their element-based results. Most notably, the almighty $$   , which   ITERATIONS VS. REGULAR LOOPS  242  is so helpful in extracting elements from the DOM based on complex criteria, systematically extends the elements it returns. Most element- returning methods added by DOM extension  for example, up     return extended elements. So, you had better think about how you use descendants   .  11.2 Iterations vs. Regular Loops  Using iterator methods  methods that will take a function as an argu- ment and invoke this function for some or all of a collection of elements  basically means that at some point the collection’s _each    method is called, and it will call your iterator. That, already, has a slight cost  double function call, with the maintenance of the closures . But the wrapper each    also needs to maintain a try catch block to deal with the $break exception, which has a signiﬁcant impact.  Generally, you shouldn’t worry too much about loop performance using iterators. Unless you’re iterating over an exceptionally large collection, you’re in the clear. However, sometimes you do need to squeeze every last bit of speed you can get. There is, then, no other alternative than writing your iteration code by hand. Make sure you do it right, then. Cache the collection length, avoid declaring too many variables in the loop block, and so on. Here’s a typical “fast” loop:  var item; for  var i = 0, l = data.length; i != l; ++i  {  item = data[i];    Process item  }  First, it declares item outside the loop scope, so there’s no allocation  release cost for every iteration. Second, it caches the collection’s length, which avoids evaluating it at every turn. Third  and least important , it uses the preﬁx ++ operator, which avoids cloning its operand.  It would appear that another approach, grabbing length and then using something like a while  l- -  loop, can squeeze even more juice out of an array iteration. But the aesthetics of it just make me nauseous. Still, it’s worth a mention—maybe it does shave off more than a few nanoseconds off the for version, should you need it.   11.3 Obsolete Event Handlers  OBSOLETE EVENT HANDLERS  243  A frequent concern is about the memory cost of large amounts of event observers. When you navigate outside the page, you may risk memory leakage on Internet Explorer, if Prototype did not take special care of this browser by manually detaching all the observers previously deﬁned by the library. On the other hand, you may have registered numer- ous observers on a page fragment that gets replaced or removed. What then?  Indeed, you would need to do some manual bookkeeping over your observers, because there currently is no simple way to decommission all the observers on a DOM fragment  although you can now easily decommission all those on a single element . This is tedious, not to mention it’s very impractical. Many observers are internal to Prototype objects, and your user code has no easy means of accessing those ref- erences.  One thing you can do is minimize the amount of observers you have. I often see people write code that creates tons of elements  say, a tree representation  and attach individual observers on each, for the same event. That’s just ludicrous. Event bubbling lets us deﬁne a single han- dler at the container level and use the event’s source element concept to handle the speciﬁc item we’re dealing with. This goes a long way toward dramatically reducing the observer count. For a detailed exam- ple of this, look at how we did it with the staff tree on page 149.  11.4 Recent Speed Boosts You Should Know About  Every release of Prototype brings with it a handful of speed improve- ments that can sometimes be quite dramatic. Warnings that were once good advice become obsolete. Here are a few speed boosts in 1.5.1 that you should know about:  Selectors are blazing fast!  Andrew Dupont  and, to a lesser degree, yours truly  did a full rewrite of the Selector class, with some heavy inspiration from Jack Slocum’s DomQuery and a healthy dose of XPath-fu.  Because of this, everything based on Selector  most notably $$    and the DOM traversal extensions  is now blazing fast. Really, at the time of this writing, it’s eating everyone’s lunch. Andrew   SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL  244  maintains a comparison bench on his website1 for you to check this out.  Iterators are faster.  The $continue thing is not supported anymore in iterations. Use a simple return in your callback instead. Not only is it faster than throwing an exception, but this strips one level of exception han- dling from the iterator, which results in a signiﬁcant boost of all iterator methods.  Array’s uniq    is much faster.  It used to rely on concat   , which meant it had a quadratic cost. It has been rewritten to use a single array and work in linear time if the array is already sorted.  Style manipulations are faster.  The element methods getStyle    and setStyle    are getting faster with just about every release.  HTML escaping is much faster.  String’s escapeHTML    method is now signiﬁcantly faster, because it does not create DOM nodes anymore.  11.5 Small Is Beautiful  Stay lean, stay lithe. Don’t churn out megabytes of markup, and don’t pre-include all the scripts you’ll ever need. Use Ajax for on-demand replacements, content loading, and so on. Improve your mastery of semantic markup and CSS to trim the fat off your DOMs. Quicker to load, quicker to run, quicker to script!  1. http:  andrewdupont.net test double-dollar    Chapter 12 Wrapping Up  Before we close this Prototype part and move on to script.aculo.us, I’d like to take you through a consolidated example that brings together quite a few of the features we’ve seen so far. Instead of a pure-text con- clusion paragraph, I think this will serve better as an executive sum- mary of sorts.  12.1 Building a Fancy Task List  Let’s say we need to create a small web page that lets us add to a small task list by entering short task descriptions. The page is designed to use Ajax when JavaScript is enabled, dynamically retrieving XHTML fragments representing the new task and adding it to the current task list. There should also be, for the hell of it, two links that let us select, or deselect, all current task list items.

For the sake of brevity, we will not have it handle both Ajax and non-Ajax cases. We’ll assume the POST requests come through Ajax and return only the rel- evant page fragment:  Download prototype ﬁreworks ﬁreworks.rb  !  usr bin env ruby  require 'cgi' require 'erb' require 'webrick' include WEBrick  template_text = File.read 'task.rhtml'  task = ERB.new template_text  taskId = 0  server = HTTPServer.new :Port => 8042    LAYING THE GROUNDWORK  247  Figure 12.1: An empty task list  server.mount ' ', HTTPServlet::FileHandler, '.'   server.mount_proc ' tasks'  do request, response  params = CGI::parse request.body  text = CGI::escapeHTML params['text'][0]  taskId += 1  Simulate random processing time  0-2 seconds  sleep 2*rand  Return XHTML fragment response['Content-Type'] = 'text html' response.body = task.result binding   end        trap 'INT'  { server.shutdown }  server.start  The fragment template is short and to the point:  Download prototype ﬁreworks task.rhtml   "  >  ">     IT TAKES ONLY 40 LINES: THE JAVASCRIPT CODE  248  12.3 It Takes Only 40 Lines: The JavaScript Code  Now that we laid the groundwork, just look at the whole script required to make the UI work:  Download prototype ﬁreworks ﬁreworks.js  Line 1  function bindUI   {  $ 'addForm' .observe 'submit', routeToAJAX ; $ 'selectAll' .observe 'click',  toggleAll.bindAsEventListener this, true  ;  5  $ 'deselectAll' .observe 'click',  toggleAll.bindAsEventListener this, false  ;  }    bindUI  function toggleAll event, doSelect  {  event.stop  ; $ 'tasks' .select 'input[type=checkbox]' .each function box  {  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  25  30  35  box.checked = doSelect;  } ;  }    toggleAll  Ajax.Responders.register {  onCreate: function   {  $ 'progress' .show  ;  }, onComplete: function   {  if  0 == Ajax.activeRequestCount   $ 'progress' .hide  ;  } } ;  function routeToAJAX event  {  event.stop  ; var form = event.element  ; new Ajax.Updater 'tasks', form.action, {  parameters: Form.serialize form , insertion: 'bottom', onLoading: function   { $ 'addForm' .disable  ; }, onComplete: function   { $ 'addForm' .enable  ; $ 'taskText' .clear  .focus  ;  } } ;  }    routeToAJAX  40  document.observe 'dom:loaded', bindUI ;  That’s it! That’s all there is.   IT TAKES ONLY 40 LINES: THE JAVASCRIPT CODE  249  Figure 12.2: Our list after typing three items  When using Firefox, Firebug lets us easily track Ajax exchanges in its console, as you can see in Figure 12.3, on the following page.  I’ll just give you a few quick comments in case you need to brush up on some of the features we learned:    The bindUI    function on line 1 registers event handlers on form submission  to route the call through Ajax  and for clicks on the toggler links.    Thanks to binding methods as in line 4, we can pass predeﬁned arguments to the unique handler: true for the selection link and false for the deselection one. This is looked up by the toggler func- tion through its doSelect argument.    Thanks to the select    utility function  see line 11 , grabbing ele- ments based on CSS selectors is easy. It is, deﬁnitely, one of the most useful  and most used  utility functions in Prototype.   IT TAKES ONLY 40 LINES: THE JAVASCRIPT CODE  250  Figure 12.3: Ajax tracing in Firebug’s console    Thanks to Ajax.Responders, we can register global listeners over  Ajax, maintaining the display of a progress indicator.    From line 29 on, the true ﬁreworks begin. This Ajax.Updater in- stantiation triggers an Ajax request based on the original form, disabling the form while the request is processed; inserts the resulting XHTML fragment at the bottom of the list; and sets the input ﬁeld back up for the next input!  Let’s try this. If you had a running WEBrick server, stop it by hitting Ctrl+C in its console, and then go to our current example directory and run the server for this example the usual way. For instance, on Windows use something like this:  C:\Spinoffs\prototype\fireworks> ruby fireworks.rb  Then navigate to the proper URL: http:  localhost:8042 ﬁreworks.html.  And indeed, this works! Typing a few texts and submitting the form trig- gers Ajax communications that return XHTML fragments then added to the list, as shown in Figure 12.2, on the previous page.  Thanks to our server script’s simulating processing delays, we can actually see the progress indicator being toggled on and off by our global responder. This is illustrated by Figure 12.4, on the following page.  This is nontrivial stuff, and yet look how concise this code is! It’s portable, it’s maintainable, it’s rather readable, and it does all that work. . . . There’s only one question left really: when do you leverage what you learned in this part of the book to apply the same scripting-fu to your projects?

We are ready to write excellent web-based user interfaces. There are two more things that would probably help:    Generic visual features, such as animated effects  for example, fades, moves, resizes  and drag and drop. Those are relevant in most user interfaces, whether they remain “web-style” or try to mimic a “desktop-like” look.    Controls! Reusable visual components for your application screens. Most widgets come with one or more predeﬁned look-and- feels, which means you would probably have to use their library throughout your user interface.  We can go widget shopping later, but we’ll ﬁnd that script.aculo.us pro- vides us with a great array of visual features with a few widgets thrown in for good measure. Originally part of Prototype itself, it split off pretty quickly and took on a life of its own. Still, Thomas Fuchs, its Vienna- based creator, has been extremely active in Prototype too and shares the commit rights with Sam.  13.1 The Modules of script.aculo.us  Unlike Prototype, script.aculo.us is divided into modules, each with its own JavaScript ﬁle. The modules are arranged by theme. Don’t be overwhelmed. Most script.aculo.us users use only the ﬁrst two of these modules:  Animated effects  This is the mother lode. The effects module comes with more than twenty-ﬁve visual effects, seven transition modes  that alter how   THE MODULES OF SCRIPT.ACULO.US  254  Which Version of script.aculo.us?  This book documents script.aculo.us 1.8, the last version in the 1.x tree, which was released in sync with Prototype 1.6. The next version of script.aculo.us, 2.0, is currently scheduled for a complete rewrite of the effects and dragdrop modules; however, fear not—the external API will likely be similar, and if it changes too much, you can expect an update  or new edition  of this book to release quickly on its heels.  the effect goes from start to ﬁnish over time , and effect queues  which let you create advanced effect sequences , enough to cover most of your needs. Even if you found it lacking, adding new effects is easy enough.  Drag and drop  You will use the dragdrop module to make any element draggable, turn it into a drop zone, or even make entire series of elements sortable so you can rearrange them by dragging and dropping—a killer improvement on list sorting.  Autocompleters and in-place editing  This module makes it easy to slap an autocompletion facility over regular text ﬁelds, which can come from the server side  through Ajax  or from a preloaded set of possibilities. You can also make just about any text or collection of items editable in-place by sim- ply clicking it. A speciﬁc UI will appear and notify the server side when the editing is done so it can be persisted.  Sliders  A slider is a sort of small rail, or track, along which you can slide a handle. It translates into a numerical value. With script.aculo.us, you can create such sliders with a lot of control: deﬁne bound- aries, restrict possible positions to speciﬁc values, use multiple handles  for instance, to deﬁne ranges , and so on.  On the other hand, customizing the aspect of your sliders will be possible only to a certain extent, which is a necessary limita- tion with such complex UI elements, when they are created using XHTML.   USING SCRIPT.ACULO.US IN YOUR PAGES  255  DOM builder  This is a developer tool that eases DOM creation considerably. When building DOM fragments, not only are the raw W3C inter- faces rather bland and unwieldy, they are not ﬂawlessly supported across browsers! There are issues with   tags or their con- tents, with table-related elements, with name= attributes on spe- ciﬁc tags, with attribute whose names are JavaScript keywords, and so on.  This object lets you specify DOM fragments in a simple way, smoothing over such discrepancies and issues.  Version 1.7.1 introduced a sound system that lets you play sounds easily, queue them up, use multiple tracks, and so on. It does not require Flash and relies on your browser’s native audio capabili- ties, usually provided through widely spread plug-ins.  Efﬁcient use of short sounds can be a really nice feature for appli- cations that need to grab the user’s attention even when the page is not visible  moved aside, hidden behind another window, re- duced to the task bar, or simply not the active tab .  Sound!  13.2 Using script.aculo.us in Your Pages  First, you’ll need to download a recent version. Thomas keeps pushing new releases pretty frequently on the ofﬁcial website, so just head to http:  script.aculo.us  and grab the latest archive. It includes the min- imal version of Prototype that this particular release relies on. If you have an earlier Prototype release, either use the one that comes with script.aculo.us or update your copy to a more recent one.  You will need to load Prototype ﬁrst and script.aculo.us second. The shortest way to do this uses two   elements, like this:         However, this will end up loading all the modules, which need to be available in the same directory as scriptaculous.js. This is uselessly wasteful. Most of the time, you need only a couple modules. So, be nice on your bandwidth, your users, and everyone by just loading the modules you need.   USING SCRIPT.ACULO.US IN YOUR PAGES  256  There is a special syntax you can use for this when loading script.acu- lo.us—just list the modules you need in the load parameter:     <script type="text javascript"  src="... scriptaculous.js?load=effects,dragdrop">   The module names are the base names of the additional .js ﬁles provided with script.aculo.us. Order might sometimes be signiﬁcant. Just look inside scriptaculous.js for the order it uses when loading them all by default.  Thomas advises that in production, you should include all the separate ﬁles directly, in proper order, and leave scriptaculous.js alone, because it’s just a convenience loader. The most efﬁcient delivery would be a concatenated .js ﬁle sent with gzipping enabled.   Chapter 14 Visual Effects  Animated effects are a huge part of why people use script.aculo.us. They are split in two groups: the core effects and the combined ones. Combined effects usually rely on the parallel, synchronized execution of other effects. Because such an execution is readily available, creating your own combined effects is very easy.  We’ll start with core effects and list the options that are part of the core effect machinery  which means they are available to all effects . Then we’ll list the combined effects and their speciﬁc options. We will then spend some time on the important topic of effect queues, currently far too underknown and underused, which makes all the difference between a newbie and an effects master. Finally, we’ll show how to create your own effects.  To use the effects capabilities of script.aculo.us, you’ll need to load the effects module. So, your minimum loading for script.aculo.us will look like this:      Note that script.aculo.us relies heavily on Prototype, so you would go something like this:         14.1 What Are Those Effects, and Why Should We Use Them?  Well, there are plenty of reasons to use effects.  Sometimes you need to bring part of your web page to the user’s atten- tion, and visual cues, such as background fade-overs, opacity pulses,   WHAT ARE THOSE EFFECTS, AND WHY SHOULD WE USE THEM?  258  growing or shrinking, might be nice. Other times, you’re just trying to ﬁne-tune the introduction, or removal, of contents; gradually revealing or hiding it  be it by adjusting opacity or by sliding in or out of view  looks and feels better than abruptly displaying or stripping it. You may also want to help users perceive a relocation by gradually moving con- tents from its origin to its destination.  Effects let you do this, and much more, in a uniform, straightforward way. They offer a wide range of standard options and callbacks to help you tailor their execution to your needs. Each speciﬁc effect usually provides even more options  for instance, Effect.Highlight, being all about gradually changing the background’s color, lets you specify the colors to begin and ﬁnish with .  Using effects appropriately can give your web applications a whole new degree of polish and can contribute to the ergonomy of Ajax-powered pages, where there may be minute changes to the contents in locations the user is not necessarily focusing on just then.  Before diving into the myriad options, callbacks, and tweaks surround- ing the effects system, I’ll introduce you to the core effects so you can get a feel of it quickly. However, we ﬁrst need to learn how to start an effect.  Starting an Effect A lot of people get this wrong, so pay attention. The proper way to start a core effect is usually with the new operator. This is because otherwise, you’re using the effect as a function, called in your main code ﬂow, which will prevent multiple effects from properly running in parallel.  Depending on your preferences, you can use one of two syntaxes:  new Effect.EffectName element [, requiredArgs] [, options]  → Effect extElement.visualEffect 'EffectName' [, requiredArgs] [, options]  → extElement  These two syntaxes are technically equivalent. Choosing between the two is mostly about your personal sense of code aesthetics. If you look at effect triggering as an external action over an element, you’ll probably ﬁnd the former syntax more intuitive. On the other hand, if we regard effects as extra capabilities of elements, then using the visualEffect    may feel more natural.   CORE EFFECTS  259  Here are two equivalent calls, so you can see how the syntaxes are related, which are very much interchangeable:  new Effect.Scale 'title', 200, { scaleY: false, scaleContent: false } ; $ 'title' .visualEffect 'Scale', 200,  { scaleY: false, scaleContent: false } ;  14.2 Core Effects  Let’s start by looking at the core effects. I know we haven’t yet looked into the generic options, common to all effects, but there are so many, plus callbacks, that you would be drowned in details without having seen actual effects yet!  So when you see a reference to a common option, such as from, to, or duration, don’t worry—it’s usually not important enough to disrupt your understanding of the effect, and if you need details, just look inside Section 14.3, Diving into Effects, on page 265 for details on the options and callbacks you’re wondering about.  Effect.Highlight  Widely known as the Yellow Fade Technique  YFT  effect. This lets you have a background color fade-over, with customizable starting and ending colors. It’s ideal to bring the user’s atten- tion to a freshly updated fragment of the page  for example, by an Ajax.Updater .  Its speciﬁc options include startcolor, endcolor, and revertcolor. The two last ones default to the element’s background color  if it can be determined  or, failing that, white. The starting color defaults to ffff99, equivalent to ff9, which is a light yellow. The color fade- over will go from startcolor to endcolor, and once the effect is done, the background color will be reset to revertcolor.  By default, the background image, if any, will be removed during the effect. If you want to have it persist, set the keepBackgroundIm- age option to true.  Because this is such a commonly used effect, there is a special convenience shortcut that lets you trigger this effect on elements with a shorter syntax than the two usual ones:  extElement.highlight  [options]  → extElement   CORE EFFECTS  260  So, triggering it with all the defaults can be as simple as this:  $ 'resultMessage' .highlight  ;  Effect.Move  Slides an element over to a new position  expressed either as abso- lute coordinates or as relative offsets , both vertically and horizon- tally.  Its speciﬁc options are x and y, both defaulting to zero, which are either absolute coordinates or relative offsets from the cur- rent position. You can tell which by setting the mode option to either absolute or relative  its default .  Effect.Opacity  Gradually changes an element’s opacity to a given level. This relies on Prototype’s opacity-related methods to work around the nu- merous cross-browser kinks.  This effect starts with the element’s current opacity unless the from option is deﬁned and ends with an opacity deﬁned by the to option, defaulting to 1.0.  Effect.Parallel  The mechanism for running effects in synchronized parallel mode. If you don’t need synchronization  effects starting and ending at the same time , simply run them independently.  You specify the effects as a ﬁrst argument to the constructor, pass- ing in an array of the effects to be run synchronously. Those effect objects must have been created with their sync option set to true. The call goes like this:  new Effect.Parallel [  ], { duration: 2 } ;  new Effect.Opacity 'notice', { sync: true } , new Effect.Scale 'notice', 100, { sync: true, scaleFrom: 50 }   Note that the effects do not necessarily pertain to the same ele- ment; however, there is only one duration  or fps rate, for that matter —the one set at the Effect.Parallel level; synchronized effects will all step ahead in unison.  Effect.Scale  Gradually scales an element up or down, possibly on only one axis  horizontal or vertical . It features a number of speciﬁc options:   CORE EFFECTS  261    scaleX and scaleY, defaulting to true, determine whether scal-  ing occurs in the given direction.    scaleContent defaults to true and activates scaling of the ele-  ment’s content, not just its container box.    scaleFromCenter lets you rescale not from the top-left corner but from the center  so the element appears to grow outward or shrink inward . This is disabled by default.    scaleFrom lets you start with the element scaled already at a speciﬁc percentage of its original size. This defaults to 100, obviously.  You noticed, I’m sure, there is no scaleTo option. This is because Effect.Scale uses a required argument to obtain its target size, expressed, like the scaleFrom option, as a percentage of its orig- inal size. The call goes like this:  new Effect.Scale 'greeter', 200, { scaleFromCenter: true } ;  Here is a small example combining Effect.Opacity and Effect.Scale through an Effect.Parallel. The result is illustrated through the montage in Figure 14.1, on the following page.  Download scriptaculous effects parallel1 demo.js  new Effect.Parallel [  scaleFromCenter: true }   ], { duration: 2 } ;  new Effect.Opacity 'demo', { sync: true, from: 1, to: 0.33 } , new Effect.Scale 'demo', 150, { sync: true,  We could make the element hide once shrunk, for example by using afterFinish, which is rather intuitive:  Download scriptaculous effects parallel2 demo.js  new Effect.Parallel [  new Effect.Opacity 'demo', { sync: true, from: 1, to: 0.33 } , new Effect.Scale 'demo', 150, { sync: true,  scaleFromCenter: true }   ], { duration: 2, afterFinish: function   {  $ 'demo' .hide  ;  }} ;  Effect.Tween  Introduced in version 1.8, this effect encapsulates any progres- sive series of settings, be it by assigning a property, calling a method, or even calling a callback function you would provide. It   CORE EFFECTS  262  Figure 14.1: Synchronized parallel use of opacity and scale  is a generic machinery that will become more prominently used in version 2.0  and already powers the combined effect Effect.ScrollTo . Its syntax is rather custom:  new Effect.Tween obj, from, to [, options], propertyOrMethodName  new Effect.Tween obj, from, to [, options], callback   The idea is simple: at periodical intervals  for each “frame” of the effect , it will use intermediate values  somewhere between from and to , in sequence, for assigning a property, calling a method, or calling your callback function.  It’s sort of PeriodicalExecuter on steroids.  Let’s consider a few examples:  new Effect.Tween 'edtGain', 1, 20, 'value' ;   CORE EFFECTS  263  Assuming the element with an id= of edtGain is some form ﬁeld, its value property will be set from 1 to 20 using default effect param- eters  up to 100 frames, or steps, in 1 second .  new Effect.Tween 'edtGain', 1, 20, { fps: 10, duration: 2 }, 'value' ;  This call features the option hash  do note that it appears before the ﬁnal argument , which makes it here so that there are exactly twenty frames over two seconds  therefore using only integer val- ues during the effect .  new Effect.Tween 'notice', 30, 120, 'setHeight' ;  Because setHeight is a method on the DOM element, the method will be called  instead of a property assignment .  var notice = $ 'notice' , color = notice.getStyle 'backgroundColor' ; var blue = parseInt  color.match  \d+    '' [2], 10   0; var rgb; new Effect.Tween notice, 0, 255, function rg  {  rgb = [rg, rg, blue].inject '', function acc, comp  {  return acc + comp.toColorPart  ;  } ; notice.setStyle { backgroundColor: rgb } ;  } ;  And this last one quickly ramps up the yellow tone of the element’s background  from absent to full bright . As you can see, Tween is pretty generic and versatile.  Effect.Morph  Quite the big gun, introduced in version 1.7. This takes a set of CSS properties and gradually migrates the element’s relevant style values to these targets. Mighty!  This effect takes a single speciﬁc option, named style. For the sake of convenience, you can express your target style deﬁnition in three ways:    As a CSS class name. The element will then morph toward  the style speciﬁcation for this class name.    As an inline style speciﬁcation  think style= attribute values .    As a hash of CSS properties. Both ofﬁcial  hyphen-based  and camelized  for example, borderStyle  syntaxes are allowed for the property names.  And that’s not all there is about convenience! Thomas anticipates so much use of this effect that extended elements get a speciﬁc   CORE EFFECTS  264  Figure 14.2: The almighty Effect.Morph in action  morph    method, with the style as the ﬁrst argument and possible options as the second. Here are examples of all three argument syntaxes:  extElement.morph 'erroneous' ;    CSS class name extElement.morph   'color: maroon; background: fdd; border-color: maroon;' ;  extElement.morph {  width: '50ex', height: '10em', backgroundColor: 'ddf', color: '009', borderWidth: '1em', borderColor: '009', opacity: '1'  }, { duration: 2 } ;  You can see a montage of how the last call behaves in Figure 14.2. It may not render too well on the black-and-white paper version of this book, but check out the source code archive!   DIVING INTO EFFECTS  265  This works best for color- and length-related properties  plus opacity  but can be used for just about anything. Color target properties cannot use color names but must use a rgb r, g, b , rgb, or rrggbb form. However, properties that cannot be gradu- ally modiﬁed  for example, font-style or text-decoration  will be set to their target value only when the morph terminates. In a more gen- eral manner, not all CSS shorthands are allowed. It will depend on your browser’s level of support for DOM Level 2 Style. Test care- fully.  A note of warning, though: at the time of this writing, if proper- ties are speciﬁed through CSS rules instead of inline styles  CSS rules being best practice , they will be retrieved as computed val- ues, thus in pixels. Such values will be used as the starting point of your effect, but they will use your target values’ units  indeed, there is no simple way to convert this alternate-unit value to a pixel-based value . So when you morph length values  for exam- ple, marginTop or borderLeftWidth , either put the initial values in inline style= attributes or use pixel units. Thomas may have ﬁg- ured out some DOM Style–fu by the time this book is released, but better safe than sorry. Try it to be sure. A similar warning goes for property values, which need to be strings at this time. Note how we set opacity to ’1’ instead of just 1.  As you can see, with these building blocks available, just about any- thing can be done. Once you can change an element’s position, size, and opacity and then run such changes in synchronized parallel mode, you’re all set!  14.3 Diving into Effects  Before going ahead with combined effects, we need to review generic options and callbacks that are available on all effects. Many of those were alluded to in the prior section, so it’s time you get the nitty-gritty details.  Common Effect Options Effects come with a number of standard options. Knowing them is one of the keys to successful effects usage  and something too few develop- ers take the time to learn .   DIVING INTO EFFECTS  266  When: delay and queue  The rule of thumb is this: an effect starts as soon as it is created. You can delay it by using the delay option, which is in seconds and which defaults to 0.0. As we’ll see later in Section 14.5, Unlocking the Cool Factor: Effect Queues, on page 272, effects are put in queues upon creation. The default value for queue, parallel, has them start as soon as the delay expires; there are, however, several other possible values, as well as the ability to create custom queues, too.  How Fast: duration, fps, sync, and transition  Effects are animated through a series of steps, or frames, spread over a given duration. By default, they run over a duration of 1.0 second, at a rate of up to 100 frames per second  fps . The effect engine adjusts depending on the performance of the user’s computer. Note that 25 fps is fast enough for the human eye to see a ﬂuid animation.  Frames are not necessarily spread evenly across the duration of the effect. For most effects, a linear distribution would actually not look too good. As we will see in a moment, script.aculo.us lets you spec- ify, through the transition option, one of eight possible “transitions,” which are simple functions determining how to get from one position  in the time window of the effect  to the next. The default transition is Effect.Transitions. sinoidal, which basically makes the effect start up slowly, quicken, and then slow back down at the end. It’s usually the best setting.  Finally, sync is both related to effect start and effect progress. In order to run effects in synchronized parallel mode  inside an Effect.Parallel, as we’ll see in a moment , you need to make sure all synchronized effects have their sync option set to true.  Cutting Corners: from and to  By default, an effect goes from a starting position of zero to a ﬁnal position of one. You can have it start ahead or stop short by adjusting its from and to options. This is mostly used for effects where these options represent extreme points of the effect’s action. For instance, with Effect.Opacity, position zero is full transparence, and position one is full opacity.  Note that from can also be greater than to. The effect will then run “backward,” so to speak.   DIVING INTO EFFECTS  267  Common Effect Callbacks All effects provide seven standard callbacks that we can use to hook custom behavior into the effect’s processing. They are usually arranged in before after pairs, and their names contain the name of the effect’s method that is wrapped between the two callbacks.  1. beforeStart occurs right before the effect is scheduled to start  right before it is queued up for execution . At this point, all of the effect’s internal properties have been deﬁned but not yet adjusted by queue control. This is mostly useful when writing custom effects. Note that there is no after variant, because no useful case for it has emerged yet.  2. beforeSetup and afterSetup occur around the setup    call, which happens when the effect renders for the ﬁrst time, after any delay or queue-caused wait has expired. Effect creators use this method to perform whatever element alterations they need for their effect to work  for example, make the element positioned, give it a layout container, and so on . Using beforeSetup is often handy.  3. beforeUpdate and afterUpdate are triggered around every single  frame rendering, including the ﬁrst one.  4. beforeFinish and afterFinish occur around effect ﬁnalization; afterFin- ish is often used instead of a custom queue when there are only two effects to queue or when you need an effect to complete before running some more code.  Bouncy or Smooth? Effect “Transitions" Most script.aculo.us users don’t realize that effects are equipped with a transition mode. As I mentioned earlier, a transition is a function that gets the effect from one step to the next, by turning a time position  from zero to one  into another one, used by update   , which does the actual rendering. By tweaking transition functions, we can obtain pretty funky visual variants over any effect.  The transition option is usually assigned one of the eight transition func- tions in the Effect.Transitions namespace. It defaults to the sinoidal    func- tion. As a special alias, setting it to false is equivalent to selecting the linear    function.  Understanding the code of these functions may sometimes be rather daunting, especially if you always hated trigonometry. To save you the   DIVING INTO EFFECTS  268  trouble, here’s a quick rundown on what impact the functions have on the series of rendering positions for the effect:  Function Impact  ﬂicker  Randomly picks from the 25% last frames, thus ﬂickering.  full  linear  none  pulse  reverse  sinoidal  spring  Effect disabler of sorts—sticks with the ﬁnal frame. This is used in synchronized parallel effects to ensure one of them is fully effective immediately. It’s also handy, at debug time, to quickly “enable” the result of an effect.  Goes from start to ﬁnish at a steady pace. For most anima- tions  especially moving and scaling , this is actually not too aesthetic. It doesn’t feel natural; it feels rather dull.  The other effect disabler—sticks with the ﬁrst frame. Tech- nically, the same effect can be achieved with a full transition over swapped values for the from and to options; it’s very much a question of personal aesthetics and logic whether you use full or none. During debugging, it’s handy to leave an effect in code while disabling it for a while.  Accelerates the effect so it runs fully more than one time in its lifetime. By default, it uses ﬁve pulses, but you can use bind    to pass it another count. For instance, the com- bined Effect.Pulsate essentially relies on Effect.Opacity with a rather crafty use of this transition.  Reverses the effect. This has it go from its ﬁnal frame to its ﬁrst one.  The default transition. This has the effect start and ﬁnish slowly but accelerate in between. This is aesthetically more pleasing for most effects, such as movements and scalings.  The latest addition. Speciﬁcally targeted at effects such as Effect.Move, this lets the effect “overshoot” a bit and then bounce back and forth around the ﬁnal position, ﬁnally stabilizing on it. This is especially nice for giving a slightly bouncy feel to reverting a drag and drop, for instance.  For examples of custom, third-party transitions, see Ken Snyder’s script.aculo.us port of Robert Penner’s easing library, as reported at http:  giancarlo.dimassa.net 2007 07 11.   14.4 Combined Effects  COMBINED EFFECTS  269  Based on core effects, script.aculo.us provides a number of combined effects, which cater to most common needs. We won’t show examples of these, but you’ll see combined demos on the documentation site.1 I’ll just list them as they stand at the time of this writing, with a few notes about speciﬁc options they may have.  Triggering a Combined Effect Unlike core effects, the new operator is superﬂuous here. The functions for combined effects are not constructors. On the other hand, they all beneﬁt from a shortcut syntax that makes them available as methods on extended elements  starting with script.aculo.us 1.7.1 . So, you can use any of the two following syntaxes:  Effect.CombinedEffectName element [, options]  extElement.combinedEffectName  [options]  → extElement  Do note that a few combined effects are left out of this latter shortcut syntax because they would conﬂict with existing extended methods or were deemed irrelevant for this shortcut use. These are Event, ScrollTo, and Transform.  Smooth Operators Effect.Fade Effect.Appear  These make an element fade away or fade in, respectively. Fading out will start, by default, with the element’s current opacity; when the effect is over, the element is hidden, and its original opacity is restored. Fading in starts by making sure that the element is dis- played and starts with its original opacity if it already was. These effects obviously rely on the Opacity core effect.  Sliding In and Out Effect.BlindUp Effect.BlindDown  These roll up  or down, respectively  a surface on which the ele- ment is supposed to be displayed. The element’s contents are left untouched and do not move. Only its surface shrinks upward or expands downward. Note that using BlindDown will work even if the element is not “rolled up” then, and the other way around.  1. http:  wiki.script.aculo.us scriptaculous show CombinationEffectsDemo   COMBINED EFFECTS  270  Effect.SlideUp Effect.SlideDown  These are content-sliding variants of the “blind” effects. These look like the blinds are being slid down or up, so the contents move along. However, this requires that the element’s contents are wrapped in an additional container, say, a  . You can’t just put the contents in the element affected by the effect, as you would on, for instance, BlindDown.  Effect.DropOut  This opens a trap under the element, in which it falls while fading out. That’s a nasty way to die  especially because the trap, being invisible, leaves no evidence whatsoever .  Creative In and Outs Most of these are based on the Scale core effect.  Effect.Grow Effect.Shrink  These make the element expand in  from size zero  or shrivel away  and stay hidden, although with restored properties, as usual . This relies on several core effects, most importantly Scale and Move. There is a speciﬁc option, called direction, that deﬁnes in which direction the expansion or contraction takes place. It de- faults to center but can also be any of the box corners: top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left.  This taps a magical wand and has the element disappear in a cloud of smoke. Well, almost—it expands to twice its size while fading away, which is just as good.  So, your element is on a good ol’ TV, and you’re switching it off. It’ll shrink away much like things did back then—with a ﬂickering, quick contraction toward the center.  This has the element shrivel away with no speciﬁc positioning. For most elements for which the point of reference is their top-left corner, it’ll contract toward that point.  This is a two-phase shrink. First it shrinks vertically, until only a tiny, 5-pixel bar is left, and then left-wise. Content is not scaled along. Think of it as folding a napkin. Sort of.  Effect.Puff  Effect.SwitchOff  Effect.Squish  Effect.Fold   COMBINED EFFECTS  271  Attention Getters  Effect.Pulsate  Effect.Shake  Effect.ScrollTo  Miscellanea  Effect.Event  Effect.Transform  “It is alive!” Your element will fade out and then in several times  customize with the pulses option, defaulting to 5  over two sec- onds. This is one of the favorites, along with the simpler Highlight.  This one feels a tad more toyish. It shakes the element right and left three times over half a second. It’s a nice way to highlight a form ﬁeld that doesn’t pass validation. Starting with version 1.8, it now features extra duration and distance options.  This is the animated equivalent of Element.scrollTo   . It gradually scrolls the viewport so the element comes into view. You can add an extra scrolling with the offset option  expressed in pixels .  This is just a code placeholder. You would use its afterFinish call- back to plug in some code. This is mostly useful in complex effect queues to lace actual effects with custom code.  Dreaming about Effect.Morph heavy lifting? This one lets you deﬁne multiple morph-related effects  called tracks , which will be run in parallel. The good thing is that it’s reusable! Here’s an exam- ple, pulled straight out of script.aculo.us’s change log  although slightly simpliﬁed :     set up transformation var transformation = new Effect.Transform [  { 'div.morphing': 'font-size: 20px; padding-left: 40em' }, { 'blah'  : 'warning' }  ], { duration: 0.5 } ;    play transformation  can be called more than once  transformation.play  ;  Three More Things You Should Know. . .    Remember that because of reliance on methods such as Element. hide    and Element.show   , you will have to style initially hidden elements with an inline style="display: none" attribute. Using a CSS rule will not work. The element will remain hidden.   UNLOCKING THE COOL FACTOR: EFFECT QUEUES  272    A lot of effects will have trouble with table-related elements  mostly  ,  , and    on Internet Explorer. More often than not, making sure your rows are properly wrapped in a    or   or    will help.    If you hit performance issues  typically frame drops , it’s usu- ally a symptom that your DOM trees are way too complex and or that you’re relying on a lot of opacity play. Several browsers  most notably, on Macs, Firefox, and Safari 2  get sluggish in such sit- uations. Reducing opacity-based effects, or the amount of effects running at the same time, usually helps a lot.  14.5 Unlocking the Cool Factor: Effect Queues  Chaining effects is a common need; maybe you want an element to fade in, and then you want to highlight it. Or perhaps it should pulsate and ﬁnally fade out. Such cases can be well enough handled by manually deﬁning the afterFinish callback.  However, consider more advanced cases. One question that keeps pop- ping up on the support mailing list sounds like this: “I have this list of items, and when I mouse over them, I’d like their picture to change with a fade-out + fade-in  not a crossfade .”  Although the requirements seem difﬁcult, the code for it is quite simple. Sure, it doesn’t rely on manually chaining effects using afterFinish. That works mostly when you know the effect list in advance and doesn’t scale very well from a readability standpoint.  No, the answer lies with effect queues. Effect queues let you deﬁne mul- tiple queues in which to put effects. You don’t have to put them at the end of the queue, either. You can ask them to zip all the way to the front, for instance.  Using the Global Queue So far, we haven’t used the queue option in our effects. It defaults to ’parallel’. When its value is a string, it is assumed to be a position speciﬁcation in the global queue  quite simply, the queue whose name is ’global’ .  Queues are stored in the Effect.Queues repository and are accessed through its get    method, passing in the queue name. When adding an   UNLOCKING THE COOL FACTOR: EFFECT QUEUES  273  effect to a queue, you can specify a position, which will be interpreted as follows:    parallel will have the effect start the next time the queue processes    front puts the effect before any pending effect in the queue, delay-  its effects.  ing them accordingly.    end puts the effect at the end of the queue, obviously. It will trigger  after all the effects currently in the queue are done.    with-last schedules the effect to start with the last pending effect currently in the queue, if any  if there is no pending effect, it will start after all running effects in the queue are over .  Queues process their effects at a rather high frequency, currently up to 100Hz, which is, in my humble opinion, faster than needed. The human eye is tricked into seeing continuity from 25Hz, and even the sharpest eyes cannot detect frames faster than 50Hz  although I’m quite certain I’ll ﬁnd hardcore gamers2 who will swear they need more . This does mean you need to watch the order in which you queue stuff up. It should be the intended order of execution, whenever possible.  So when you specify any of these values for the queue option  once again, parallel is the default , you use the global queue, which is ﬁtting for most purposes. For instance, maybe we want to react to an Ajax update in failure mode by morphing the updated panel to a given CSS class and then pulsating it:  var updater = new Ajax.Updater 'feedback', ' user update', {  parameters: $ 'userForm' .serialize  , onComplete: function   {  if  !updater.success    {  $ 'feedback' .morph 'errors' .pulsate { queue: 'end' } ;  }  } } ;  Custom Queues: Shifting Gears This is all well and good, but it won’t quite cut it when you need to deal with independent queues for several objects. For instance, the fade- change-fade sequence we mentioned earlier, which is a common use  2. Especially ﬁrst-person-shooter gamers  which is ironic, because the abbreviation also spells FPS. Um. . . .    EFFECT HELPERS  274  case, won’t work with a global queue for all the items in the list. Each item needs its own queue.  The solution is to use scoped queues. Instead of just using a position string for your queue option, provide an object with two properties: scope, which identiﬁes your queue, and position, which is your position string.  How about a nice example? Let’s take this item list we mentioned:       JavaScript     Prototype     script.aculo.us       OK, now if we provide some mouseover mouseout machinery so that going in triggers a black-and-white image and going out goes back to the normal version of the image, the core code for implementing the transition looks like this:  Download scriptaculous effects queues demo.js  var queue = { scope: element.id, position: 'end' }; element.visualEffect 'Opacity', { to: 0.1, duration: FADE_DURATION,  queue: queue } ;  new Effect.Event { queue: queue, afterFinish: function   {  element.setStyle {backgroundImage: url} ;  }} ; element.visualEffect 'Opacity', { from: 0.1, to: 1,  duration: FADE_DURATION, queue: queue } ;  Note the queue deﬁnition. It uses a unique scope, based on the sufﬁx of the source element’s ID; all effects deﬁned are stored in that queue by using their queue option. Since queues are separate, we can trigger parallel sequences on multiple items while retaining sequential execu- tion for the effects at the item level.  Finally, note that you can enforce a limit to the events in a queue at any given time by using an extra property for your queue option object: limit. This can be useful to prevent rapid-ﬁre clicking from queuing up a huge amount of Ajax requests, for instance, when only a few ones make sense from an ergonomical standpoint.  14.6 Effect Helpers  Thomas acknowledges very common use cases now and then, swooping in with a nice little helper. Over time, the following surfaced:   EFFECT HELPERS  275  Effect.toggle     When hiding elements, you often show them back. And hide them again. And so forth. Because you often toggle visibility, usually with one of the Fade Appear, BlindUp BlindDown, or SlideUp  SlideDown sets, the convenience Effect.toggle    is here to make it shorter. Calling it on an element will check whether it’s hidden  read: its display CSS property is set to none  and call the appro- priate effect based on that.  Effect.toggle elt [, family = 'appear']   The allowed families are, logically enough, appear, blind, and slide. Note you don’t have to actually use these in pairs. An ele- ment toggled off using the slide family, for instance, can perfectly be brought back using blind.  This is one Flash killer. It applies any effect, in delayed sequence, over a series of elements. For instance, you could use it with Effect.Fade over the items in a list, to have them fade away progres- sively, from ﬁrst to last, each beginning to fade out shortly after the previous one. This is governed by the generic delay option, plus the speciﬁc  though ill-named  speed option, which expresses the internal delay between two consecutive elements, in seconds. It defaults to 0.1".  You can pass elements in a variety of ways:  Effect.multiple element, effect [, options]  Effect.multiple [ element, ... ], effect [, options]  Effect.multiple NodeList, effect [, options]   Effect.multiple     When a single element is passed, its childNodes property is used.  The really neat use of this is when you have text where each char- acter is a separate element  for example, a   of its own . You can then pull off awesome progressive text fades, for instance. Of course, marking this up is a bore. That is why we have. . .  Effect.tagifyText     This one is mostly a support function for multiple   . It takes all the text child nodes of an element and replaces them with the proper    taking care of a few styling issues . Making regular text ready for multiple    magic becomes a snap. Here’s a short example:  Effect.tagifyText 'heading' ;    just once Effect.multiple 'heading', Effect.Highlight ;    any time   HOW TO CREATE OUR OWN EFFECTS  276  Figure 14.3: Who needs Flash anyway?  Beware: many effects end up with actually hiding the element. When applied in sequence over the characters of an element, this can result in weird, left-shifting behavior. You may then want to short-circuit the internal ﬁnalizer of these effects. Make sure this has no undesirable side effect, but when you’re ready, it should look something like this:  Effect.multiple 'heading', Effect.Fade, {  speed: 0.05, afterFinishInternal: Prototype.emptyFunction } ;  The source code for this book comes with a detailed example that lets you pick among ﬁve effects and try it. Figure 14.3 shows a montage of how this looks with Fade.  There are also several helpers that are more targeted at effect authors. We’ll discover that now.  14.7 How to Create Our Own Effects  Writing custom effects is a skill that can range from simple combina- tions to aping the code of existing combined effects to truly displaying some script.aculo.us-fu. Covering all of it is beyond the scope of this chapter, but I’d like to give you a few pointers anyway so that you can start on a clear trail.   HOW TO CREATE OUR OWN EFFECTS  277  Before digging in, understand the dependencies for your custom effects. As script.aculo.us changes, you will need to test your work against the new releases. As a matter of fact, script.aculo.us 2.0 will have a completely rewritten effects engine, which should not, however, stop the 1.8 version from working.  What’s an Effect to Do? Most effects are supposed to derive from the Effect.Base class. They can then use this base to hook up their speciﬁc logic for initialization, rendering, and ﬁnalization.  An effect has a number of properties, mostly for internal use, that con- stitute its state. Many of them are going to be very useful to you when writing your own effects, especially for the rendering logic, so let me quickly describe them:  Property  Description  ﬁnishOn  currentFrame As we saw in Section 14.3, How Fast: duration, fps, sync, and transition, on page 266, an effect’s anima- tion is divided into frames. Every frame gets rendered at most once  frames may be skipped because of CPU hogging or debugging breakpoints, for instance . The amount of frames depends on the duration of the effect  duration option, defaults to 1  and its frames per second ratio  fps option . The ﬁrst actual frame is 1.  expressed in milliseconds since the The moment epoch, the usual numerical form of times  at which the effect should ﬁnish  based on delay and duration options . The difference between the to and from options. You normally never have to deal with it yourself; render    uses it to create a proper evolution of your rendering positions. The options passed at construction time, possibly adjusted by the initialize    method. Your current rendering position, as a ﬂoating-point number between 0 and 13  same scale as the from and to options . It’s automatically adjusted by render   , prior to triggering update callbacks.  fromToDelta  position  options  3. Although on a few transitions, such as Spring, it may exceed 1 at some point.   HOW TO CREATE OUR OWN EFFECTS  278  Property startOn  state  Description The moment  expressed in milliseconds since the epoch, the usual numerical form of times  at which the effect should start  based on the delay option . A string that tells where your effect stands in its life cycle. The possible values are idle  not started yet , running, and ﬁnished.  totalFrames The total amount of frames for the effect, based on its duration and fps options. By way of consequence, this is the maximum amount of calls to your update    method. The duration of your effect, in milliseconds. It’s based on the duration option.  totalTime  Note that it is possible to short-circuit an effect, abruptly stopping it where it stands, by calling its cancel    method. This does not trigger the ﬁnish callbacks.  Speaking of callbacks, in order to let users of your shiny new effect use them, you will not hook them up for internal processing. The effect machinery lets you deﬁne identical callbacks with the Internal pre- ﬁx  for example, afterFinishInternal   , which are called right before the “public” ones. This is where you should put code that doesn’t ﬁt in the clear-cut methods you can redeﬁne.  The execution of an effect is sequenced as follows, codewise:  1. The usual initialize    method is called. It’s all yours. You must end  it with a call to start   , passing it the options hash.  2. start    takes care of all the boilerplate setup. Before scheduling your effect in the proper queue, it triggers the beforeStart    call- back.  3. As soon as the effect is scheduled for execution, its loop    method kicks in, which veriﬁes that it should still run  it might be over- due  and, if not, takes it straight to the ﬁnish line. Otherwise, it computes its regular position and frame number and delegates to render   .  4. render    takes care of the setup callbacks on the ﬁrst rendering, calling your optional setup    method between the two, and then delegates to the effect’s chosen transition to adjust the rendering position. It then calls your optional update    method with it.  5. The effect has reached its end time. It renders its ﬁnal position, it gets decommissioned from the effect queue, and your optional ﬁnish    method is called between the two ﬁnish callbacks.   HOW TO CREATE OUR OWN EFFECTS  279  The following methods are an integral part of the effect system, so you never override them: start   , loop   , render     it would, anyway, be rede- ﬁned dynamically by start    , and cancel   .  On the other hand, the following methods are undeﬁned by default and are designed for you to deﬁne according to your effect’s logic. They are all optional, because their usefulness entirely depends on your effect’s nature:  1. setup    is called before the ﬁrst actual rendering. 2. update pos  is called for every rendering, with a position adjusted by the transition function. It’s where you put the actual frame- creating code. For instance, if you look at this method for the core Effect.Opacity, it simply goes like this: update: function position  {  this.element.setOpacity position ;  }  3. ﬁnish    is called after the last rendering and after the effect has been decommissioned from its queue. You’ll mostly use it when your effect is supposed to restore some state on its element s . For instance, numerous ofﬁcial effects that end up hiding an element they transformed do hide it and then restore its original style.  Helpers for the Effect Author You’ll ﬁnd many helper methods in effects.js that take care of several little tricks you might need to pull off when writing effects  after all, Thomas did . First, element extensions gain more methods still:    getInlineOpacity    returns the CSS opacity property from the ele- ment’s inline style= attribute or the empty string if there is no such property.    forceRerendering    forces the browser to render the element again by doing a ﬂash DOM update and revert on its contents, which can be useful to circumvent the occasional odd browser-rendering bug.    setContentZoom percent  alters the element’s font size by the given factor  expressed as percents, for example, 120 to zoom up 20% .  Our beloved String also gets a couple helpers:    parseColor [default]  turns the string representation of a CSS color into the six-digit CSS form  rrggbb . This can start from the same form, the three-digit form, or the developed form  rgb r, g, b  . If the   HOW TO CREATE OUR OWN EFFECTS  280  string is not deemed valid, it will return the method’s argument, or failing one, will return itself.    parseStyle    takes a CSS property list  for example, the value of an inline style= attribute  and turns it into a hash object with the corresponding properties.  An Example: Effect.Wave Thomas demonstrated custom effects creation at RailsConf US 2007 with this Effect.Wave class. It makes the characters in an element’s text slide up and down to create a wave effect. This is a nice example because it relies only on the two critical methods, setup    and update   , with no internal callbacks or other extra tricks.  Download scriptaculous effects wave demo.js  Line 1  Effect.Wave = Class.create Effect.Base, {  initialize: function element  {  this.element = $ element ; this.start arguments[1]  {} ;  setup: function  {  Effect.tagifyText this.element ; this.chars = this.element.childElements  ;  5  },  10  },  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  15  20  } ;  } } ;  update: function position  {  var factor = position < 0.5 ? position * 2 :  1 - position  * 2; var topPos; this.chars.each function character, index  {  topPos = Math.sin position *   index % 20  + 1   * 30 * factor; character.setStyle { top: Math.round topPos  + 'px' } ;  This code illustrates a number of common practices in writing your own effect:    On line 3, we extend the element we’re supposed to operate on and cache this in a property. This way, we can use extended methods on it throughout our code without wondering whether we need to extend it on the ﬂy.    It is essential to remember passing our options argument, if any, to the start    method, as on line 4. If we fail to, all the generic options  for example, to or duration  will stop working! Of course,   HOW TO CREATE OUR OWN EFFECTS  281  Figure 14.4: Effect.Wave in action  if no options argument was passed, we substitute an empty hash instead.    Right when the effect is about to render its ﬁrst frame, on line 8, we replace its text with individual, per-character   ele- ments using tagifyText     which we know from on page 275 . This lets us grab all these  s on line 9. We might as well cache the result of this DOM exploration, because we don’t much care whether it changes while the effect takes place.  Then it’s just a matter of playing with a sine function to compute the vertical positions of each letter, one frame after another. There are a lot of magic numbers in this function, but don’t be put off. This is just the result of tweaking and adjusting until it felt cool; there’s nothing mandatory or mission critical in there. . . .  The effect at work can be seen in Figure 14.4.  Where to Start? First, you’ll ﬁnd many user contributions  of varying quality  on the ofﬁ- cial site in the script.aculo.us “Treasure Chest:” http:  wiki.script.aculo.us scriptaculous show EffectsT You’ll ﬁnd several nice additions in there, such as Effect.DropIn, Effect.Bounce, extra transition functions, and more.  Second, a good idea is to go through the source code of effects.js. By studying the code for ofﬁcial effects, you can understand a lot and get inspired by the wizardry Thomas pulls off now and then.   HOW TO CREATE OUR OWN EFFECTS  282  What We Just Learned  Effects are a prominent part of script.aculo.us and a rather rich API. Let’s quickly summarize what we covered in this chapter:    There are two kinds of effects: core and combined. The seven core effects are created using the new operator, but combined ones are called like regular functions.    Most effects apply to a single element and can take a hash of  options, many of which are common to all effects.    By default, effects run immediately upon creation; therefore, they  execute in parallel, although not necessarily in sync.    To run multiple effects in perfect sync, we need to wrap them in  an Effect.Parallel call and set their individual sync options to true.    Effects can also be arranged in queues, with the queue option.   Transitions control the variation of speed across the effect’s dura- tion. The default transition, Effect.Transitions.sinoidal, has a “natu- ral” feel to it by accelerating slightly after the beginning and decel- erating again shortly before the end.    A few effect helpers facilitate common usage patterns, such as applying the same effect on multiple elements with a small delay between each trigger.    We can create our own effects and add them to the library.  Neuron Workout  Here are a few questions to ponder and suggestions for code practice:    Say we have half a dozen items  effects and custom code snippets  we want to queue up like pearls on a string. What’s the best option here? afterFinish callbacks or a custom queue? Why?    How would you queue two effects with a two-second pause be- tween the end of the ﬁrst effect and the beginning of the second one?    Write horizontal blind effects  Effect.BlindLeft and Effect.BlindRight .   How could we turn any effect into a permanent loop?  And that’s it for effects. It’s a fascinating thing, no doubt, and one of the main reasons people use script.aculo.us. The other main developer magnet is the support for drag and drop, including its use to reorder elements on the page. That’s what we’ll dive in next.   Chapter 15 Drag and Drop  A huge part of what people envision when they think “Web 2.0 inter- face” is drag and drop. Moving blocks around in a customizable portal page, resizing elements, putting items in a shopping cart, and reorder- ing items in a list—it all comes down to dragging and dropping. For- tunately, script.aculo.us comes with strong support for this capability, easing integration into our own web applications.  To use script.aculo.us’s dragging capabilities, you’ll need to load the dragdrop module, which requires the effects module. So your minimum loading for script.aculo.us will look like this:  <script type="text javascript"  src="scriptaculous.js?load=effects,dragdrop">   15.1 Dragging Stuff Around  Let’s start with the basics: making an element draggable and dragging it around. We’ll then see how we can react to various stages of the drag and look at the numerous aspects that can be customized.  Also, remember that we did use simple drag and drop in Section 9.2, Get It: Geometry Persistence, on page 192, so you’ll ﬁnd example code there as well.  Making an Element Draggable OK, ﬁrst things ﬁrst: making an element draggable. It can be as simple as instantiating a Draggable object over it  or its ID, as usual :  new Draggable element ;   DRAGGING STUFF AROUND  284  If you need to remove dragging capability later, you’ll have to keep the reference tucked somewhere and call its destroy    method when its time has come.  Let’s create an example that we’ll build upon as we discover new op- tions. We’ll draw a small checkerboard and put a nice, spiffy Tux  you know, the Linux mascot  on it.  This particular Tux looks lovely but a bit overweight, so dragging sounds appropriate.   Create a new directory, and then copy the usual prototype.js, scriptacu- lous.js, and effects.js ﬁles, plus dragdrop.js. Here’s our HTML page:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop board step1 index.html  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">         Playing with draggables       <script type="text javascript"  src="scriptaculous.js?load=effects,dragdrop">       Playing with Draggables                                      Tux is draggable   We’ll create the board cells dynamically. First, this spares us from tedious markup in the board element; second, this opens the door to custom event handling and other scripting tricks later, should we feel like it. Every cell will be a   element in the board’s  , with an id= attribute containing the cell class and, alternatively, the white or black class.   We’ll also want to demonstrate how to cancel dragging functionality by destroying the Draggable object. That’s what our bottom checkbox is for. Here’s the whole script:  DRAGGING STUFF AROUND  285  'class': 'cell ' +  1 ==  row + col  % 2 ?

Notice how it uses Element’s constructor syntax  on line 7  to easily build the DOM node.  The toggleTux    function is responsible for either making the Tux drag- gable or removing draggability. It stores the reference in the gTux vari- able. We’re going for the most basic creation here. Just look at line 20. Disabling draggability is as easy as a destroy    call, which you can see on line 16.  Figure 15.1, on the following page, shows a montage of various dragging stages of this ﬁrst implementation.   DRAGGING STUFF AROUND  286  Figure 15.1: Tux dragging about  Try unchecking the box. You will now notice the cursor no longer indi- cates dragging capability, and attempting to drag Tux is rewarded by resonant failure. Checking the box again restores the penguin’s ﬂeet- ness of feet.  As basic usage goes, here are a few things you should know:    You can always interrupt a drag by pressing the Esc key.   During drag, the element’s opacity moves to 70%. Its original opac-  ity is restored when the drag ends.    By default, the whole element is made draggable. Holding the “left”  that is, main  mouse button over any part of it will trig- ger the drag. You can restrict this to part of the element’s con- tents through the handle option, which we’ll discuss in a moment. It’s commonly used to drag through a title bar or a corner, for instance.    If your element needs to be both draggable and clickable, trigger- ing drag as soon as the mouse button is down can be a problem and result in disruptive ergonomy. You can use the delay option, discussed later, to require the button to stay down for a given time before the drag actually happens  it will catch up on the mouse movement in the meantime, if necessary .   DRAGGING STUFF AROUND  287  Interacting with the Drag: Callbacks Draggables come with a few callbacks, some of which are reserved for local use  being passed in the draggable object’s options  and are marked in the next table with an asterisk  * . We’ll see “global” use in Section 15.5, Monitoring Drags, on page 301.  When used locally, all callbacks take the Draggable object as the ﬁrst argument and the event object as the second argument. Also note that when you have a Draggable reference in hand, you can get the element itself using its element property.  Callback onStart  onDrag  change*  Description The drag starts. The start effect, if any, has not been applied yet, but any other preliminary work  cloning, position adjustments, and so on  was per- formed already. The drag is going on. While in drag state, the element is about to be moved in order to reﬂect mouse movement. This occurs immediately after having moved the element in response to mouse movement.  onDropped* The element was just successfully dropped on a deﬁned drop zone somewhere. We’ll talk more about drop zones starting on page 301. The drag is freshly over. Finalization  revert effect, reverting, and end effect, if any  is about to start.  onEnd  Let’s demonstrate callbacks by adding a highlight CSS class to our board while the drag is going on and by building a position log of our Tux as it gets dropped on cells. We’ll use the chess notation of cells: rows numbered from A, top to bottom, and columns numbered from 1, left to right. Tux is deemed to be on the cell where its top-left corner stands.  First, we need to add an element for the log. An ordered list seems pretty appropriate from a semantic standpoint:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop board step2 index.html                DRAGGING STUFF AROUND  288  The style sheet needs the corresponding adjustments:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop board step2 demo.css  board.tuxMoving { background-color: f77; }  log {  }  position: absolute; left: 212px; top: 0; height: 202px; width: 10em; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: smaller; color: 555; overflow: auto;  Finally, we’ll rework part of our script:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop board step2 demo.js  Line 1  function getTuxCell tux  {  var pos = tux.positionedOffset  ; return [ pos.left   64 .floor  ,  pos.top   64 .floor  ];  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  }    getTuxCell  function toggleTux   {  if  gTux  {  gTux.element.setStyle { cursor: 'default' } ; gTux.destroy  ; gTux = null; return;  }; gTux = new Draggable 'piece', {  onStart: function   {  $ 'board' .addClassName 'tuxMoving' ;  }, onEnd: function d  {  $ 'board' .removeClassName 'tuxMoving' ; var pos = getTuxCell d.element ; pos = 'ABC'.charAt pos[1]  +  pos[0] + 1 ; $ 'log' .insert ' Tux to ' + pos + ' ' ;  } } ; gTux.element.setStyle { cursor: '' } ;  25  }    toggleTux  The getTuxCell    function converts our Tux’s position within the board’s conﬁnes  which includes the padding  to a cell number. It’s not entirely accurate but will do until we rework it later for better movement con- straints.  Starting on line 14, notice how our creation call has grown, with its two new callbacks: onStart  which turns on the board highlighting  and onEnd  which turns the highlighting off, computes the cell’s name, and adds it to the log .   CONTROLLING HOW IT STAR TS, WHERE IT GOES, & HOW IT ENDS  289  Figure 15.2: Callbacks: highlighting and logging  Figure 15.2, shows the highlighted board  red background around the cells  during drag, and the state of the right-side log after a few move- ments.  15.2 Controlling How It Starts, Where It Goes, & How It Ends  Drags use effects at three points: starting, ending, and reverting—if there is one. We’ll consider reverting ﬁrst, which can be interesting for our examples.  A reverting draggable element will move to its original position when released. By default, draggable elements do not revert, but you can enable this systematically or based on custom condition code. You can also customize the default reverting movement.  In our example, we’d like our Tux to revert whenever it’s dropped out- side the board. We’d also want this revert to last a bit longer than the default movement, and to add an extra twist, we’ll use the bouncy spring transition for the reverting movement so that Tux overshoots its orig- inal location and bounces back and forth around it for a short time before stabilizing.   CONTROLLING HOW IT STAR TS, WHERE IT GOES, & HOW IT ENDS  290  The two options governing revert are as follows:  Option revert  Description Whether to revert the drag  bring the element back to its original position  when the mouse button is released. This can be a boolean, a function, or the special value ’failure’, which reverts when there was no successful drop. This defaults to false.  reverteffect The effect to be used for the revert animation. This defaults to a properly deﬁned Effect.Move. It takes three arguments: the dragged element and the dragging’s hori- zontal and vertical offsets.  We’ll equip our Tux element with an expando isOut    function. This will serve us well as a value for the revert option and will help us prevent logging of the movement if we decided to revert it.  This leaves our markup and styling untouched. The creation of our Draggable object, however, features two more options:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop board step3 demo.js  Line 1  var range = $R 0, 2 ; $ 'piece' .isOut = function   {  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  20  25  var pos = getTuxCell this ; return ! range.include pos[0]  && range.include pos[1]  ;  5  }; gTux = new Draggable 'piece', {  revert: $ 'piece' .isOut.bind $ 'piece'  , reverteffect: function tux, top_offset, left_offset  {  var secs = Math.sqrt  top_offset^2 .abs   +  10   left_offset^2 .abs    * 0.06;  new Effect.Move tux, {  x: -left_offset, y: -top_offset, duration: secs, queue: { scope: '_draggable', position: 'end' }, transition: Effect.Transitions.spring  15  } ;  }, onStart: function   {  }, onEnd: function d  {  $ 'board' .addClassName 'tuxMoving' ;  $ 'board' .removeClassName 'tuxMoving' ; if  d.element.isOut    return; var pos = getTuxCell d.element ; pos = 'ABC'.charAt pos[1]  +  pos[0] + 1 ; $ 'log' .insert ' Tux to ' + pos + ' ' ;  } } ;   CONTROLLING HOW IT STAR TS, WHERE IT GOES, & HOW IT ENDS  291  The isOut    method takes advantage of an ObjectRange instance to eas- ily check that the computed cell for Tux is within board boundaries  0 to 2 on both axes .  Notice how we take care to bind it on line 7. If we didn’t do that and simply passed $ ’piece’ .isOut, we’d lose the binding, and once invoked, its this would evaluate to the calling context  in this particular case, certainly not our Tux element . The revert function is actually passed the dragged element, but that would make for less elegant calling in the onEnd callback, so explicit binding it is!  The code for the reverteffect callback, starting on line 8, is fairly com- plex, but it’s actually lifted straight from the default code in dragdrop.js. Only its duration is altered  using a factor of 0.06 instead of 0.02, giving us more time to savor the effect  and its transition  instead of relying on the default sinoidal one, it uses spring .  Finally, note how we reuse isOut    within onEnd, on line 22, to avoid log- ging an invalid, reverted movement. Because we’re calling the method directly on the proper object, there’s no need to bind. Its this reference will match the object it’s called on.  I’d be hard-pressed to illustrate the resulting effect on a printed snap- shot. Just save, reload  make sure you bypass your cache if necessary , and try dragging Tux onto the board and then outside  far outside, be bold!  the board. Observe the spring. Love it. Play for a while, and call your buddies over to your desk. Then on to more options!  I mentioned effects were allowed for revert, but they’re also allowed at drag start and drag end. As we saw, those default to playing with opacity  what’s too bad is they also maintain an internal state to avoid multiple drag initiations on the same object, which should never occur anyway . The two options for these callbacks are as follows:  Option endeffect  Description The visual effect to apply on the element when the drag is completely done. This defaults to bringing its opacity back to its original value in 0.2".  starteffect The visual effect to apply to the element when the drag starts. If the default end effect applies, this defaults to bringing the element’s opacity to 70% in 0.2".  If you need to keep full opacity, for instance, just set the endeffect property to something equivalent to false  for example, false indeed, or null . This will automatically disable the default start effect, too.   CONTROLLING HOW IT STAR TS, WHERE IT GOES, & HOW IT ENDS  292  On drag start, the element is also pushed “up,” from a 3D perspective, to be “closer” to the eye of the user; this is done by adjusting its CSS z- index property, according to the zindex option. The end of drag restores the original setting.  Option Description  zindex  The z-index  “layer”  of the element while being dragged. This defaults to 1,000 in order to be sure it’s above anything else. When manually dealing with such layer ordering, you may want to set it to false, as we did in Section 9.2, Get It: Geometry Persistence, on page 192.  Finally, in certain circumstances, you may not want the drag to be initiated immediately  that is, as soon as the main mouse button is pressed . Perhaps your element is also clickable, and you don’t want a regular click to trigger a drag as well. To this end, the delay option lets you specify a duration, in milliseconds,1 for the main mouse button to remain pressed before the drag is triggered. Naturally, this defaults to zero, but setting it to values as small as 500 can make all the difference in the world.  Option Description  delay How long the button should be down before we actually start dragging. This is in seconds, and it defaults to zero. The drag will align on the mouse pointer when the delay expires. If the button is released before the delay is over, no drag is attempted.  Controlling How the Draggable Element Moves By default, the user can drag your element all over the place. This is ﬁne for many situations, but there are cases where you’d like to constrain how the element moves. There are basically two needs you may have, perhaps combined, too:    The element must not move on a pixel basis but by larger incre- ments  say, by 10-pixel steps . These increments are not neces- sarily the same horizontally and vertically.    The element must not move outside a given bounding box  its con-  tainer element, for instance, or some arbitrary box you deﬁned .  1. This is actually the only duration-related option in all of Prototype and script.aculo.us that is in milliseconds, not in seconds.   CONTROLLING HOW IT STAR TS, WHERE IT GOES, & HOW IT ENDS  293  Both these needs are addressed with the snap option, which defaults to false, meaning there is no constraint.  Option Description  snap  Governs the smoothness and boundaries of the drag. By default, the drag is pixel-ﬁne and roams freely all over the place. You may need to specify a “resolution” for the drag  for example, moving by 25-pixel steps , limit the drag to a speciﬁc screen region  for example, the container element , or both.  Sticking to a Grid  By setting snap to a positive integer value, you’ll make your element move only by steps of this size, both vertically and horizontally. Proto- type will monitor actual mouse movements to determine just when to update the element’s actual position. For instance, the following code makes the element with id="item1" draggable by 15-pixel steps:  new Draggable 'item1', { snap: 15 } ;  Should you need a different “grid size” for horizontal and vertical move- ment, just specify two pixel sizes in an array. The following example uses 15-pixel horizontal steps but 5-pixel vertical ones:  new Draggable 'item1', { snap: [15, 5] } ;  This could force our Tux to move on a cell-by-cell basis, staying cleanly aligned. However, that doesn’t prevent it from venturing outside the board  at which point it would revert, granted .  Limiting the Movement to a Given Area  However, the real power of snap is revealed only when assigning to it a function that adjusts raw coordinates according to your needs. Such a function takes three arguments: the x and y positions and the Drag- gable object itself  in case you need to share it across draggable items .  Using such a function is the only way to apply boundaries to the drag’s movement. For instance, here’s a code snippet that makes sure the element with id="item1" does not stray outside a  0,0 - 100,50  box:  new Draggable 'item1', { snap: function x, y  {  return [  x   100 ? 100 : x  , y   50 ? 50 : y ];  } } ;   CONTROLLING HOW IT STAR TS, WHERE IT GOES, & HOW IT ENDS  294  And here’s a more advanced example forcing it to remain within its container object: new Draggable 'item1', {  snap: function x, y, draggable  {  function constrain n, lower, upper  {  if  n > upper  return upper; return  n < lower ? lower : n ;  }; elementDims = draggable.element.getDimensions  ; parentDims = Element.getDimensions draggable.element.parentNode ; return [  constrain x, 0, parentDims.width - elementDims.width , constrain y, 0, parentDims.height - elementDims.height ];  The possibilities are numerous, but these two cases cover most of them  and, I like to think, provide inspiration for your custom needs .  When it comes to our Tux, what we’d like is a combined snap. It would prevent it from straying outside the board  which we can do simply by checking that it’s not “out”  and force it to stay aligned on cells. As an added beneﬁt  although whether that is a beneﬁt is very much a subjective call , because Tux will stay penned on the board, we can get rid of the revert code!  As before, our markup and styling remains untouched. Only the script- ing evolves—to the following creation call:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop board step4 demo.js  Line 1  gTux = new Draggable 'piece', {  snap: function x, y  {  return [x, y].map function coord  {  coord =   coord - 4    64 .round  ; return  coord   2 ? 2 : coord   * 64 + 4;  } ;  }, onStart: function   {  }, onEnd: function d  {  $ 'board' .addClassName 'tuxMoving' ;  $ 'board' .removeClassName 'tuxMoving' ; var pos = getTuxCell d.element ; pos = 'ABC'.charAt pos[1]  +  pos[0] + 1 ; $ 'log' .insert ' Tux to ' + pos + ' ' ;  Notice a creative use of map    on line 3, which applies the same trans- form to both our coordinates. This time we do adjust accurately, taking  } } ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  } } ;   CONTROLLING HOW IT STAR TS, WHERE IT GOES, & HOW IT ENDS  295  into account the 4-pixel padding of the board and using round    to align on the nearest cell, not necessarily the one to the left and top of Tux. You’ll probably recognize the double-ternary code for value bounding we used earlier in Section 15.2, Limiting the Movement to a Given Area, on page 293.  Once again, snapshots would be useless. Save, refresh, and play with Tux. You’ll see it’s now nicely constrained to stay aligned over cells and stick within the board.  There is a ﬁnal movement-related option, which comes in handy when all you need is to restrict movement to a single axis  something that is done implicitly by many script.aculo.us features, such as reorderable containers or sliders, which we’ll discover in later chapters .  Description  Option constraint Whether to limit how the element is moved by dragging or not. This defaults to false but can also be ’horizontal’ or ’vertical’. This is cumulative to more ﬁne-grained control with snap. It’s handy when you just need to restrict the movement axis.  Drag Handles Often enough, you won’t want the whole surface of the element to trig- ger the drag. Common UI conventions assign this role to a part of the element, such as a widget’s title bar or speciﬁc spots along the element’s edge. We’ll refer to such a part as a drag handle.  By default, as we’ve seen, the whole element is the handle. However, we can change that with the handle option. We can either pass it the DOM reference of the handle element  which is, quite likely, a descendant element of the dragged one  or pass a string. In the latter case, script.- aculo.us will try to use it as a CSS class ﬁrst, within the context of the dragged element. If that yields no descendant element, it will be used as an id= value. If it still yields nothing, the handle option is silently ignored  so watch out for typos in its value .  Option Description handle Identiﬁcation of a restricted area of the element to use for initiating drags. Defaults to false, which means drag can be initiated from anywhere on the element’s surface. This can also be a DOM reference, an ID, or a CSS class name.   CONTROLLING HOW IT STAR TS, WHERE IT GOES, & HOW IT ENDS  296  The CSS class variant is useful when you’re applying the same Drag- gable construction code to multiple elements. You cannot repeat an id=, but you can certainly use the same class in multiple constructs.  Say our Tux doesn’t like us grabbing it all over and dragging it around  this guy has its pride, you know . So perhaps we’d drag only its feet  is that any better from a pride standpoint? Hmmm. .  What we need here is to put a transparent element over these feet and make that element the handle. So, let’s modify our markup, styling, and scripting quickly:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop board step5 index.html            Download scriptaculous dragdrop board step5 demo.css  pieceHandle {  }  position: absolute; left: 8px; top: 53px; width: 48px; height: 8px; cursor: move;  Download scriptaculous dragdrop board step5 demo.js  function toggleTux   {  if  gTux  {  gTux.handle.setStyle { cursor: 'default' } ; gTux.destroy  ; gTux = null; return;  } gTux = new Draggable 'piece', {  handle: 'pieceHandle', snap: function x, y  {  return [x, y].map function coord  {  coord =   coord - 4    64 .round  ; return  coord   2 ? 2 : coord   * 64 + 4;  } ;  }, onStart: function   {  }, onEnd: function d  {  $ 'board' .addClassName 'tuxMoving' ;  $ 'board' .removeClassName 'tuxMoving' ; var pos = getTuxCell d.element ; pos = 'ABC'.charAt pos[1]  +  pos[0] + 1 ; $ 'log' .insert ' Tux to ' + pos + ' ' ;  } } ; gTux.handle.setStyle { cursor: '' } ;  }    toggleTux   GHOSTING  297  Notice we changed the manual cursor changes so they pertain to the feet-covering  , not the whole Tux anymore. Save, refresh, and try it. You can’t drag Tux anywhere except on its feet anymore!  Naturally, handle is useful in more serious contexts, too. The most com- mon use cases are title bars or resizing handles in widgets and windows for reordering items in a list  à la Ta-da Lists .  15.3 Ghosting  When you’re dragging to express an actual movement of data  for exam- ple, taking an item out of a “excluded” list into a “included” list , regular drag is ﬁne and proper. In other contexts, dragging may be a means of assigning a speciﬁc status to a piece of data. Perhaps you’re putting an item in your shopping cart; this doesn’t mean the item is not in stock anymore and available for further shopping. Or perhaps the element represents one of a few building blocks for a sequence, and you can drag such elements repeatedly on some sort of sequence container to build the sequence itself.  Or you may just not want the original element to move out of its original position, because this would cause a reﬂow that you could consider useless until there is an actual drop.  For this kind of situation, you can arrange to drag a temporary clone of the draggable element; this clone is called a ghost, so the option for it is ghosting, which defaults to false. By simply setting it to true, you’ll get to drag a ghost of the element instead of the element itself. This doesn’t change anything about other aspects of the drag  for example, movement constraints, reverting, or effects . When you’re done with the drag, you can use callback hooks to manipulate the original element if need be.  Option Description ghosting Whether to use ghosting, that is, dragging a clone of the  element instead of the original one. This defaults to false.  Note that ghosting doesn’t make a lot of sense unless you’re dealing with speciﬁc drop locations or drop-related actions. We’ll deal with dropping in the next major section. In the meantime, Figure 15.3, on the following page illustrates what a ghosting-enabled drag looks like. You will ﬁnd the example in the source code archive for this book in scriptaculous dragdrop ghosting.   DRAGGING AND SCROLLING  298  Figure 15.3: A drag with ghosting enabled  15.4 Dragging and Scrolling  Option scroll  Description Identiﬁes the scroll container, if any. This is used for autoscrolling. If deﬁned and the drag reaches the bor- ders of the container’s viewport, it will scroll automat- ically based on factors deﬁned in the two next options. This can be any element  or its ID  or the window object.  edges of the scroll container. This defaults to 20. The autoscrolling speed, in pixels per second.

This defaults to 15.  scrollSensitivity The threshold for autoscrolling,  in pixels from the  scrollSpeed  When ramping up to advanced UIs, you’ll sometimes ﬁnd yourself need- ing to let the user drag stuff around within scrollable containers. The simplest case is when the web page itself is higher  or wider  than the window’s viewport  the part of the window that renders your page  and your user needs to drag somewhere on the page that is not currently visible.  You may also have a scrollable container somewhere within the page  a   with overﬂow="auto", perhaps , in which elements can be dragged.   DRAGGING AND SCROLLING  299  By default, script.aculo.us’s dragging systems will not deal with this. But you can have them detect that your cursor is on the edges of such a container and have it scroll accordingly to let the user reach the intended drop location. This simply requires setting the scroll variable so it references the container element, either by ID or by direct refer- ence. If you’re working with the whole viewport, set it to the predeﬁned window object.  However, this also means you cannot have an element drag inside its scrolling container  with autoscrolling  and be able to “drag out” of it.  You can adjust edge detection and scroll speed using the two com- panion options: scrollSensitivity, which determines how close to the con- tainer’s edges the cursor must get to trigger autoscrolling  defaults to 20 pixels , and scrollSpeed, which states how fast autoscrolling will go, in pixels per second  defaults to 15 . This is actually a basis for com- puting the actual speed, which will increase as the cursor gets closer to—or even go over—the edges.

Autoscrolling can be particularly useful when dealing with sortable lists, which we’ll dive deeper into starting at Section 15.8, Sorting with Drag and Drop, on page 307.   15.5 Monitoring Drags  MONITORING DRAGS  301  Should you need to monitor dragging activity throughout your page, you can use the observer facility provided by the global Draggables object. All drag activity passes through it, and it is always happy to let you know.  All you need to do is register your own observer object by passing it to Draggables.addObserver   . Your observer can implement any of the three callbacks described as available globally in Section 15.1, Interact- ing with the Drag: Callbacks, on page 287: onStart  the drag just started , onDrag  the position is about to change , and onEnd  the drag has just concluded .  All callbacks get passed three arguments: the callback name  in case you share a callback across multiple events , Draggable object  in case you share a callback across multiple elements , and the event object itself.  Astute readers  that’s all of you  will have remembered that we used this global monitoring facility in our geometry persistence example, back on on page 198. We used it to monitor drops so we could persist window positions  “geometry”  on the server side through Ajax.  15.6 Dropping Stuff  So far we just dragged stuff around with no special place to put them down. Although this can be sufﬁcient for certain applications, most of the time we don’t let our users just shufﬂe the UI. Items are usually supposed to be dropped on speciﬁc locations: a task list, a shopping cart, and so on.  Much as you can make elements draggable by creating a Draggable object on them, you can turn elements into drop zones by registering them with Droppables.  A Simple Drop Zone So, you have this element that should act as a drop zone. Fine. Just call Droppables.add    on it. This can be as simple as the following:  Droppables.add 'dropZoneId' ;   CUSTOMIZING DROP BEHAVIOR  302  15.7 Customizing Drop Behavior  However, the actual syntax is as follows:  Droppables.add element [, options]   There are many options, which we’ll discover in a moment. The impor- tant thing is, once your element is a drop zone, dragging will interact with it. Your element will get notiﬁed when something is dragged over it or dropped on it, for instance. And dropping an element on a drop zone triggers a new callback, onDropped, just before the usual onEnd callback.  By default, your drop zone will accept any element for dropping. It’s very liberal about what you drop in its lap. Naturally, we’ll be able to tailor all this to your needs, as we’ll see in the next section.  Just as you can take a draggable element and strip its dragging ability, you can take a drop zone and turn it back into a regular element, using the Droppables.remove    method. Just pass it your element.  Not Letting Everybody In A common need is to be picky about which elements you accept on a particular drop zone. In a nontrivial UI, you may well have several kinds of draggable elements, each category being droppable at speciﬁc loca- tions. You can specify this with two options: accept and containment.    accept takes a CSS class name and requires any draggable ele- ment to have it among its CSS classes in order to be “cleared for landing.” This offers maximum ﬂexibility for your dropping policy, and it lets you ﬂag any element, regardless of its tag name or ori- gin in the document. You can also pass in an array of CSS class names.    containment spares you manual CSS class assignment when all acceptable elements come from the same container  which is very frequently . Just specify the id= of their container element, and only they will be allowed to drop. Like with accept, you can pass either a single value or an array of values. Because the values here are elements, you can pass, as always, either id= values or direct DOM references.   CUSTOMIZING DROP BEHAVIOR  303  Naturally, you can further reﬁne your dropping policy by mixing both options together.  To demonstrate this, we’ll build a simple shopping cart. To keep things simple, we’ll stay on the client side, but notifying the server is as simple as creating an Ajax.Request in the drop zone’s onDrop callback.  Our simple shopping cart will feature several items we can put  as many times as we’d like  in our shopping cart. We can also decide to put stuff out of the shopping cart by dropping them into the trash can. Obviously, there would be no point in dragging buyable items directly to the trash, and we won’t let the user drag cart items back onto buyable items.  So, let’s mock up a massively discounted  and massively reduced  ver- sion of the Pragmatic Bookshelf’s online store. The XHTML page looks like this:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop cart1 index.html  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">         Discount bookshelf       <script type="text javascript"  src="scriptaculous.js?load=effects,dragdrop">            Discount bookshelf          Your cart:                     CUSTOMIZING DROP BEHAVIOR  304  We’ll need a bit of CSS for this to work:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop cart1 demo.css  h1 { font-size: 1.5em; }  products { margin-bottom: 20px; height: 180px; }  .product, cart img { cursor: move; }  width: 350px; height: 100px; padding: 1ex; border: 1px solid fa0; font-family: sans-serif; color: gray;  cart {  trash {  }  }  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  } } ;  } ;  width: 64px; margin: 0; padding: 1ex; border: 2px dotted white;  * Internet Explorer doesn't know transparent... *   Now for the script. It’s actually rather concise:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop cart1 demo.js  Line 1  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  $$ '.product' .each function book  {  new Draggable book, { revert: true } ;  } ; Droppables.add 'cart', {     accept: 'product', onDrop: function book  {  var bought = new Element 'img' ; bought.src = book.readAttribute 'src' .replace '.', '_tiny.' ; new Draggable bought, { revert: true } ; $ 'cart' .appendChild bought ;  } } ; Droppables.add 'trash', {  containment: 'cart', onDrop: function bought  {  bought.remove  ;  We start by making all elements with the product CSS class draggable, on line 3. Then we proceed to create two drop zones. The ﬁrst one is the cart, which accepts only those elements with a product CSS class, as required by the accept option on line 6. The second one is the trash can, which accepts only those elements originating from the shopping cart. This is what the containment option says on line 14.   CUSTOMIZING DROP BEHAVIOR  305  Figure 15.5: Several steps of our cart working  Note how we create small, draggable   elements to populate the cart but still let the user take them away to the trash can. On line 9, we create Draggable objects for them, with the revert option, which will have them slide back into place unless they’re properly dropped. In such a case, we’ll simply remove them from the DOM.  If you were to implement this with a server notiﬁcation, the server side would probably compute the new representation of the whole cart, and you’d use Ajax.Updater over the cart container.  Figure 15.5 shows a montage of our shopping cart on load  empty , dur- ing cart addition, and during trashing  a few additions and trashings in between were skipped .  If you’re using multiple drop zones and they happen to overlap, you must be careful about the order in which you’re creating them. Check out Section 15.9, Creating Droppables in the Right Order, on page 320 for details.  Reacting to Drag A few options let you exert ﬁner control over how the drop zone reacts to dragged elements hovering over it.   CUSTOMIZING DROP BEHAVIOR  306  A useful one is hoverclass, which lets you specify an extra CSS class that is slapped on the drop zone when it is hovered over by an acceptable draggable element  not when the element is deemed unacceptable for dropping . This lets you make it obvious, visually, that the drop can be made. We could adjust our shopping cart CSS like this:  And then, we change our script to add the relevant hoverclass options:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop cart2 demo.css  cart.dropAllowed { background: ffd; }  trash.readyToTrash { border-color: red; }  Download scriptaculous dragdrop cart2 demo.js  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  $$ '.product' .each function book  {  new Draggable book, { revert: true } ;  } ; Droppables.add 'cart', {  accept: 'product', hoverclass: 'dropAllowed', onDrop: function book  {  var bought = new Element 'img' ; bought.src = book.readAttribute 'src' .replace '.', '_tiny.' ; new Draggable bought, { revert: true } ; $ 'cart' .appendChild bought ;  } } ; Droppables.add 'trash', {  containment: 'cart', hoverclass: 'readyToTrash', onDrop: function bought  {  bought.remove  ;  } } ;  } ;  Figure 15.6, on the next page, shows these options in action, both for the cart and the trash can.  By the way, in addition to the onDrop callback, there’s also a onHover callback that gets ﬁred on a drop zone, with three arguments: the dragged element, the drop zone element, and an overlap factor.  You can safely ignore this last one, though. It’s mostly for Sortable purposes.   Also remember that Draggable elements can have a onDropped call- back, as I mentioned on page 287, which is ﬁred whenever the drag- gable element is released on a drop zone that had accepted it. This takes the draggable element as its sole argument and triggers after the zone’s onDrop callback.   SOR TING WITH DRAG AND DROP  307  Figure 15.6: hoverclass on drop zones  Finally, I’d like to mention this little-used option you can put on Drag- gable when you intend to work with drop zones:  Option Description  quiet Whether to wait until drop to check whether dropping is allowed and work with the drop zone. This defaults to false, so drop zones interact with the drag on the ﬂy. If you have a truckload of drop zones, enabling it can help improve perfor- mance.  15.8 Sorting with Drag and Drop  By using Draggable and Droppables, you can achieve just about any drag-and-drop need you may have.  One of the most common needs is to provide the user with the ability to reorder elements  such as items in a list  by dragging them. Without drag and drop, reordering can be a nightmare of clicking arrow glyphs or similar buttons and can take a while to go through. For users, it does seem to take forever, which is a sure sign your reordering is not going to be used much. Mouse support is a big help here, letting users sim- ply drag items in their ﬁnal position. However, this particular feature calls for quite a hefty amount of advanced code  if you want to make it reusable , which is why script.aculo.us provides extended reordering support out of the box through the Sortable class.   SOR TING WITH DRAG AND DROP  308  I Want a Sortable List, Now! Yes, I can feel it from where I sit. So, let’s go for a simple example. We’ll just deﬁne a regular ordered list and make it sortable, leaving all options  for they are numerous  to their defaults. Our XHTML page has the usual structure, and the body looks like this:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop sortable1 index.html   You ought to love these guys       Arnaud Berthomier   Élodie Jaubert   Justin Palmer   Rick Olson   Thomas Fuchs      We’ll keep the styling to almost nothing:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop sortable1 demo.css  h1 { font-size: 1.5em; } li { cursor: move; }  Sortable.create element [, options]   The scripting goes like this:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop sortable1 demo.js  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  Sortable.create 'guys' ;  } ;  We’ll just need a pinch of scripting, based on the following method:  That’s it. Honest! Figure 15.7, on the next page, shows various stages of toying around with the list through drag and drop.  And it’s not just for   or   containers, either. You’ll be able to use this for just about any elements within a given container. We’ll see how to customize this in a few moments with the options.  Getting the Items’ Order As the user reorders the elements in your sortable container, you’ll probably want to get the current ordering now and then, perhaps to store it on the server.  Sortable.serialize element [, options]  → URLEncodedString   SOR TING WITH DRAG AND DROP  309  Figure 15.7: Dead-simple list sorting  It produces a URL-encoded representation of the current ordering, based on the id= attributes for the container and the ordered elements. The default rule is as follows:    The container’s id= attribute is used as ﬁeld name, sufﬁxed with []  this makes things easy on server layers based on PHP or Rails, for instance, and poses no discomfort to other technologies . If that’s unsatisfactory to you, you can override this by passing a name option  it will still be sufﬁxed with square brackets .    The id= attributes for the ordered elements  Sortable uses   children by default  are used to extract ﬁeld values. They are analyzed using a regular expression, which defaults to Sortable. SERIALIZE_RULE; I’ll spare you the details, but this means your id= attributes need to be of the form xxx_yyy, and the second part  everything after the ﬁrst underscore  will be used as a value.  So, let’s take our previous example. We had the following list:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop sortable1 index.html   You ought to love these guys       Arnaud Berthomier   Élodie Jaubert   Justin Palmer   Rick Olson   Thomas Fuchs      Now let’s assume the user moved Élodie in ﬁrst position and Thomas in fourth, as shown on Figure 15.7.   SOR TING WITH DRAG AND DROP  310  Here are a couple serialization calls and their results:  Sortable.serialize 'guys'     -> 'guys[]=2&guys[]=1&guys[]=3&guys[]=5&guys[]=4'  Sortable.serialize 'guys', { name: 'users' }     -> 'users[]=2&users[]=1&users[]=3&users[]=5&users[]=4'  The default requirement for id= structure is usually just ﬁne, but you might need to cater to other formats. Perhaps you need to use hyphens instead of underscores or take the whole id= instead of just a part?  You can do this by providing a custom format option, which must be a regular expression object isolating the desired part as the ﬁrst captured group.2 Note that you can deﬁne this option once and for all when creating the Sortable object, too. It doesn’t have to be deﬁned every time you call serialize   .  Let’s suppose we have the following list:      Wired   456 Berea St.   A List Apart      These id= attributes do not match the default format option, and we would end up with a useless result: subs[]=&subs[]=&subs[]=. But we can provide a custom format, either at creation time or, as in the fol- lowing script, when serializing:  Sortable.serialize 'subs', { format:  ^sub \d+   }     -> 'subs[]=123&subs[]=456&subs[]=789'  Keeping Posted with Two Callbacks When you let your users reorder elements, you want to be notiﬁed when they do. There are actually two distinct situations here:    An element is being dragged and gets into a new position; it’s not being dropped yet, so it might end up being dropped in its original position eventually. Still, the onChange callback is notiﬁed, with the dragged element as an argument.  In regexes, a captured group is a group of characters delimited by parentheses  unless 2. the opening parenthesis is immediately followed by ?:, in which case the group is noncap- turing . They are numbered starting from 1 and are useful to individually grab parts of the matched string, perhaps to reuse them later in the search pattern or in a replacement pattern.   SOR TING WITH DRAG AND DROP  311    An element was dragged and dropped, and the ordering actually changed compared to before the drag. The onUpdate callback is ﬁred, with the container element as argument.  A small note about just when an element “changes position” in the list while being dragged: it requires the mouse cursor itself to be dragged beyond half the hovered element, in the dragging direction  for instance, if you’re dragging vertically, the mouse cursor must go beyond half the height of the hovered element . That’s pretty intuitive behavior for most users.  Let’s augment our previous example to get the hang of just when these callbacks get called. We’ll just add two notiﬁcation zones below the   element, like this:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop sortable2 index.html         Now let’s change our Sortable creation to register two callbacks:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop sortable2 demo.js  Line 1  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  var changeEffect; Sortable.create 'guys', {  onChange: function item  {  var list = Sortable.options item .element; $ 'changeNotification' .update Sortable.serialize list .escapeHTML   ; if  changeEffect  changeEffect.cancel  ; changeEffect = new Effect.Highlight 'changeNotification',  { restorecolor: 'transparent' } ;  }, onUpdate: function list  {  $ 'updateNotification' .update Sortable.serialize list .escapeHTML   ; $ 'updateNotification' .highlight { startcolor: '99ff99' } ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  } } ;  } ;  Notice the trick on line 5. The argument we receive is the dragged element that just changed position, but we cannot use this on Sortable. serialize   . We need the container on which we called Sortable.create   . Naturally, we could just pass the id= of the container, or the reference to it, but the code here is more generic and dynamically retrieves the container for the element we pass.   SOR TING WITH DRAG AND DROP  312  Figure 15.8: onChange and onUpdate in action  We also avoid multiple highlight effects going on concurrently when the user drags too fast across the list, and we make sure any highlight ﬁnishes with a transparency instead of whatever degree of yellowness was current  because of a previous highlight going on  when the latest onChange    callback happened.  Figure 15.8 shows various states of the page as we drag an item around and ﬁnally release it. Releasing it on its original position does not ﬁre onUpdate, because the ﬁnal order is unchanged.  Binding to Ajax Of course, onUpdate is a prime candidate for triggering Ajax notiﬁca- tions to the server, for instance when the user reorders a to-do list or some other data set. Combining Ajax.Request and Sortable.serialize makes live persistence simple enough:  Sortable.create 'tasks', {  onUpdate: function list  {  new Ajax.Request ' tasklist 1', {  parameters: Sortable.serialize list   } ;  } } ;  Note that if your server side is RESTful, you’ll probably want to add the method: ’put’ option, because you’re updating data, not creating it.  Reordering with Horizontal Layouts So far we’ve used list reordering in a vertical layout, and you may have noticed, when trying our examples, that the dragging won’t let you move items horizontally; only vertical movement is rendered.   SOR TING WITH DRAG AND DROP  313  This behavior is controlled by the constraint option, which defaults here to vertical. And indeed, for most cases, it’s a reasonable constraint.  But your list might be horizontally displayed, in which case you’ll need to constrain movement accordingly. You may even have multiple lists and need to swap elements between them, a frequent use case we’ll illustrate later in this chapter, at which point you’ll need to remove movement constraints altogether.  To address all three cases, constraint has three possible values, which we already listed back when looking at Draggable options: ’vertical’  the default , ’horizontal’, and false  no constraint at all .  Also note that Sortable relies on its overlap option to determine whether a dragged element should change position in the list. When using a constrained layout  that is, a constraint option that is not false , overlap should use a matching value.  Let’s see a quick example of a horizontal layout. We’ll take the following XHTML list:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop sortable3 index.html      Alexis Toulotte   Amir Jaballah   Anne-Julie Peschaud   Élodie Jaubert   Erin Odenweller      Then we’ll style it so as to obtain a horizontality:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop sortable3 demo.css  h1 { font-size: 1.5em; } guys {  list-style-type: none; padding: 0;  } guys li {  float: left; cursor: move; margin-left: 1em; padding: 0.2em; width: 10em; border: 0.05em solid gray; background: ddd; text-align: center;  }   SOR TING WITH DRAG AND DROP  314  Figure 15.9: Horizontal reordering  Finally, we’ll adjust our scripting so it takes horizontality into account:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop sortable3 demo.js  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  Sortable.create 'guys', { constraint: 'horizontal',  overlap: 'horizontal' } ;  } ;  Notice how we take care to synchronize the constraint and overlap op- tions in a single-direction reordering like this? Figure 15.9 uses a mon- tage to illustrate reordering in action on such a list.  Sorting More Than Regular Lists You’re absolutely not required to use list markup  that is,  ,  , and    in order to get reordering capabilities. Sortable lets you specify the tag identifying which child elements of your container are up for dragging.  You can express this primarily with the tag option, which defaults to ’li’. All child elements with the tag name you provide are then taken into account. For instance, say you have the following markup:                SOR TING WITH DRAG AND DROP  315  To let your users reorder the elements in your   container, you’d need code like this:  Sortable.create 'avatars', { tag: 'img' } ;  Perhaps you need to restrict this, however, to only a subset of these children, in which case you can also deﬁne the only option. It defaults to false, which disables it. You can set it to either a single CSS class name or an array of CSS class names to precisely select which children elements are to be used.  We can try this easily; let’s take our previous page and change the list deﬁnition to the following markup:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop sortable4 index.html      This stays on top.   This can, on the other hand.   And this too!   You can reorder this one.   This stays at bottom.      } ;  Now all we need to do is change our Sortable creation to this:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop sortable4 demo.js  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  Sortable.create 'chapter', { tag: 'p', only: ['orderable', 'moveIt'] } ;  There! We can drag all but the two outermost paragraphs, because they do not match any of the CSS classes we speciﬁed for the only option.  Version 1.7.2 introduced a new option, called elements, which lets you specify exactly which child elements you want to reorder, and only those will be taken into account. When you do know, beforehand, which ele- ments will need to be draggable for reordering, this is by far the fastest way to initialize your Sortable object. It skips any sort of DOM traversal or CSS-based selection.  The elements option is originally disabled  by being set to false , so you would enable it by assigning it with an array of elements  for example, the result of a $$    call . As usual, any item in this array can be either a string with the element’s id= value or the element’s DOM reference.  Naturally, if this option is enabled, it supersedes any other means of deﬁning child elements for reordering.   SOR TING WITH DRAG AND DROP  316  Reordering Trees!  Sometimes you’re not dealing with linear lists  or list equivalents  but element trees, with containers inside items inside containers inside. . . . In short, these are nested lists.  Dealing with this efﬁciently and correctly is by no means a simple task; script.aculo.us does provide a tree-handling feature, which is still somewhat experimental, but seems to hold up pretty well to real-world use. You need to create a Sortable object only on the outermost con- tainer, but you must pass the proper options, including two speciﬁc ones: tree and treeTag.  The tree option is simply a boolean ﬂag used to activate alternative behaviors in the Sortable internals in order to deal with tree-like ele- ment structures. Set it to true in order to deal with nested containers.  The treeTag option lets you specify which tag you rely on for containers. This assumes all containers, outermost or nested, use the same tag. This defaults to ’ul’, but you can change it for your needs  for example, ’ol’ or ’div’ .  To put credit where it’s due, I should mention that most of the tree support code was contributed by Sammi Williams.  You can look at a fairly good demonstration of sortable trees at work in the corresponding functional test page within your script.aculo.us dis- tribution: test functional sortable_tree_test.html. Also note that the seri- alized form of a tree is slightly different than for linear lists in order to account for the nesting.  A Classic: Two Lists Mixing It Up Users often need to drag elements back and forth between multiple lists. This is interesting because it requires a speciﬁc setup for several options:    constraint will likely be set to false in order to let our users drag  elements in both directions.    containment, inherited from Droppable options, will probably be used to restrict acceptance of drops from our own list and a few other ones, not just from anywhere.    dropOnEmpty will be useful if we want a list to still accept items from the outside once we depopulated it entirely. This will imple- ment drop logic but may not be sufﬁcient. If our container has   SOR TING WITH DRAG AND DROP  317  no speciﬁc style ensuring it has a nonzero size when empty, there won’t be a single pixel to drop on when all items are gone. We’ll use onUpdate callbacks to toggle a speciﬁc CSS class on empty lists in order to ensure they’re visible even when empty and can thus be dropped items on.  Let’s take a page similar to our previous examples, but we’ll use two lists this time:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop sortable_multiple index.html      Diane Mellini   Élodie Jaubert   Valérie Savalle          Dan Webb   Justin Palmer   Scott Raymond      We’ll throw in some styling to make it easier on the eyes:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop sortable_multiple demo.css  h1 { font-size: 1.5em; }  ul {  }  li {  }  position: absolute; top: 4em; padding: 0; list-style-type: none; width: 10em;  height: 2em; cursor: move; line-height: 2em; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.5em; border: 1px solid gray; background: ff9;  paris { left: 2em; }  world { left: 18em; }  world li { background: 9f9; }  ul.empty { height: 2em; border: 1px solid silver; background: ddd; }   SOR TING WITH DRAG AND DROP  318  Finally, we just need a few lines of script:  Download scriptaculous dragdrop sortable_multiple demo.js  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  var options = {  constraint: false, containment: ['paris', 'world'], dropOnEmpty: true, onUpdate: function list  {  var methodStart = list.down 'li'  ? 'remove' : 'add'; list[methodStart + 'ClassName'] 'empty' ;  }  } ;  }; Sortable.create 'paris', options ; Sortable.create 'world', options ;  Figure 15.10, on the following page shows a montage of several stages in using these lists. Play with it, and notice how items change con- tainers past a certain overlap threshold and what happens when a list becomes empty  or goes from empty to one element . Isn’t it cool?  Using Regular Drag-and-Drop Options with Sortable Internally, Sortable works with the two core objects: Draggable and Droppables. It astutely combines both features to achieve this reorder- ing capability. From a developer perspective, this means you can cus- tomize a lot of things by using options you would normally pass to new Draggable or Droppables.add.  Of course, Sortable may need to ensure certain options have speciﬁc val- ues, but most of them are passed untouched to the underlying objects. Here’s a quick rundown. Refer to the description of these options earlier in this chapter for further details.    Underlying Draggable objects take the following options into account: constraint, delay, ghosting, handle, scroll, scrollSpeed, and scrollSensitivity. In addition, effects  starteffect, reverteffect, and end- effect  are used if you do provide a function  if you attempt to dis- able them by using false, for instance, that will be ignored . In the same spirit, a non-null zindex option will be used.    Underlying Droppable objects take the following options into  account: containment, hoverclass, and overlap.  Version 1.7.2 introduced a special optimization with regard to the han- dle option, though. It is similar to the new elements option. When you know exactly which elements should serve as handles, you can pass an array of these elements through the handles option. They will be used in   COMMON PITFALLS  319  Figure 15.10: Multiple lists at various stages  ascending order on whatever elements are deemed eligible for reorder- ing  see Section 15.8, Sorting More Than Regular Lists, on page 314 for details on that .  As usual, you can pass in the array either id= values or direct DOM ref- erences. The handles option defaults to false, which effectively disables it. When enabled, it supersedes the regular handle option.  15.9 Common Pitfalls  Drag and drop generally works just ﬁne, but you should be on the lookout for a few common issues. It’s quite possible to inadvertently misuse it.   COMMON PITFALLS  320  Removing or Replacing a DOM Fragment You must be extra careful when removing fragments of the DOM con- taining elements that were drop zones  by extension, this also applies to Sortable elements .  Whenever you drag elements around, script.aculo.us will loop through its internal drop zone list to ﬁnd geographical matches. Having drop zones in this list that are not in the DOM anymore can cause several issues, but the dominant one is a painful freeze of the browser.  Prototype Core is currently working on implementing custom events, which would let Thomas jump in and make sure script.aculo.us auto- matically mops up relevant drop zones, but for now you have to take care of the cleanup yourself. So, be on the lookout for DOM removals and replacements  for example, Ajax.Updater processing  that wipe out sections of the DOM where drop zones are registered. Be sure to unreg- ister them as soon as possible  it’s OK to do this after the replacement happened, as long as the user didn’t get a chance to initiate a drag in between .  More generally, it pays to try to stay lean with the Draggable objects, Droppables-registered elements, and Sortable objects you keep around. For instance, if you have a very large set of items that are potentially draggable, use lazy initialization over those that the user appears to want to drag. Only make those draggable, on the ﬂy. You’ll notice a signiﬁcant speedup! For further details, search through the archives of the Spinoffs mailing list.3  The cleanup methods are as follows:  draggable.destroy   Droppables.remove element  Sortable.destroy element   Creating Droppables in the Right Order A common mistake is to create drop zones in the inappropriate order. When a draggable element hovers the document, it will iterate through the drop zone list in registration order, and the ﬁrst one to match will be used, regardless of layering  the z-index property .  3. http:  groups.google.com group rubyonrails-spinoffs   COMMON PITFALLS  321  So if you have a drop zone B that is located “inside” a drop zone A but A was registered before B, you’re in trouble, because B will never get a hold on your element; only A will.  There is actually one case where script.aculo.us will still behave prop- erly despite this—when B is a descendant element of A in the DOM. But if you’re playing with unrelated elements put where they are through speciﬁc positioning, you need to tread carefully.  The rule of thumb to avoid this is simple. Always register your drop zones from the inside outward, instead of the other way around. It may appear counterintuitive, because we’re used to the outside-inward order because of DOM creation, but we need to think about it from a layering standpoint: the foremost zone ﬁrst and then working away toward the background.  What We Just Learned  As you can see, in barely 30KB of uncompressed JavaScript, script.acu- lo.us provides an incredible wealth of features for dragging and drop- ping, thanks to a few core objects and a wealth of options that cater to just about every need. This part of the library truly opens the doors to signiﬁcant improvements of the user experience in our web applica- tions.  Let’s recap what we just saw:    Making an element draggable is as simple as doing a new Drag-  gable over it.  behavior.    Draggable supports a wealth of options to control movement and    Any element can become a drop zone, that is, a surface that reacts to a dragging operation hovering over it and dropping onto it. We just need to do a Droppables.add over the element. Options let us ﬁlter out unwanted drops.    An observer mechanism lets us globally monitor drag and drops  in our page.    Because drag and drop is a great way to sort items and sorting is a common need, we have the Sortable class, which enables drag- based reordering of any series of elements.   COMMON PITFALLS  322    We need to look out for DOM removal of elements that were made draggable or droppable and to be cautious about the order of cre- ation of our drop zones.  Neuron Workout  Here are some issues we should think about. . .    What happens when we dynamically add an item to an already  sortable list? Does it participate in the reordering? Why?    How can we ﬁx this? In general, how should we react to the con-  tents of a sortable sequence being changed?    When should we use constraint instead of going all the way with  snap?    What kind of optimizations can you imagine for situations where  a sortable list has a very large set of elements  say, thousands ?  script.aculo.us doesn’t stop there. It goes on to provide autocompletion for text zones, in-place editing, and even sliders, as we’ll see in the following chapters.   Chapter 16 Autocompletion  Autocompletion is one of those features that suddenly popped up on a popular site and soon became an obvious one to have. It’s immensely useful to help your users zero in on existing values, which reduces their time to task completion  no multiple round-trips for the whole page in order to get the spelling right or reﬁne the search, for instance , allevi- ates your need to process such suboptimal submissions, and generally makes everyone happier.  So, how do we use it in our apps? Thanks to script.aculo.us’s built- in autocompletion facility, making any text ﬁeld autocompletable is a snap, be it from a client-side data source or through Ajax.  You’ll need the controls.js module, which contains the autocompletion classes but also effects.js  the default behavior for showing and hiding the autocompletion list relies on quick appear fade effects . So, your script.aculo.us loading will look, at minimum, like this:  <script type="text javascript"  src="scriptaculous?load=effects,controls">   16.1 The Basics  Out of the box, script.aculo.us supports two sources for autocomple- tion:    Local sources  string arrays in your web page’s scripts    Remote sources  obtained through Ajax   Depending on the source you’re planning to use, you’ll instantiate Auto- completer.Local or Ajax.Autocompleter, respectively. Although equipped with speciﬁc options, these two objects share a large feature set and provide a uniform user experience.   THE BASICS  324  There are four things you’ll always pass to these objects when building them:    The text ﬁeld you want to make autocompletable. As usual, you  can pass the ﬁeld itself or the value of its id= attribute.    The container for autocompletion choices, which will end up hold- ing a     list of options to pick from. Again, pass the ele- ment directly or its id=. This element is most often a simple  .    The data source, which will be expressed, depending on the source type, as a JavaScript array of strings or as a URL to the remote source.    Finally, the options. As always, they’re provided as a hash of sorts, and both autocompletion objects can make do with no custom option; there are suitable defaults for everything.  The shared feature set and behavior is put in the base object for every- thing autocomplete-related: Autocompleter.Base. You’ll probably never need to use it in your code, even if you’re building a custom autocom- pletion widget  you’ll more likely extend one of the speciﬁc objects .  Built-in Behaviors Autocompleter.Base goes to great lengths to make it as easy as possible on you by providing a lot of proper default behaviors. Note in particular the following:  Automatic container conﬁguration  You don’t need to do anything special to your container for auto- completion choices. You’ll usually just put a   in the markup, with an id= and, likely, a dedicated CSS class.  When you build your autocompletion object, this container will automatically be hidden; when it’s time to display choices in it, it will automatically be positioned absolutely if need be and then aligned and resized below the text ﬁeld  it will retain any height you may have speciﬁed, however . It then fades in quickly  0.15" . When a choice is selected or the completion is aborted, it auto- matically fades out just as fast.  In the same spirit, your text ﬁeld’s autocomplete= attribute will be turned off automatically to prevent conﬂict between the browser’s native autocompletion feature and script.aculo.us’s.   LOCAL AUTOCOMPLETION  325  Using the keyboard and mouse  Once a list of choices is displayed, it automatically reacts to the keyboard and mouse to help you pick an option as easily as possible:    The Up and Down keys change the selected option  and wrap at the limits of the list . Hovering the mouse over options auto- matically changes the selected option to the one below the cursor.    Pressing Tab or Return , or clicking an option, conﬁrms its selection and completes the text ﬁeld accordingly. The list is then hidden.    Pressing Esc or moving the focus away from the text ﬁeld  cancels completion, hiding the list.  Options You’ll Get No Matter What Whatever the source mode, you’ll always get at least the following three options:  autoSelect  frequency  minChars  Determines whether to automatically accept the autocompletion choice when it’s the only one. Defaults to false  indeed, in many situations, this can be confusing to the user .  This option lets you specify the interval, in seconds, between two attempts at autocompleting the input. It defaults to 0.4, which is reasonably fast from a user’s standpoint.  Determines how many characters need to be typed before auto- completion kicks in. This is useful when relying on a data source that has so many values that choices would be too numerous based on only a few characters. Still, it defaults to 1.  16.2 Local Autocompletion  Let’s start here with the simplest setup: a data source provided by a JavaScript array in our own script. Create a directory for this, and put the necessary JavaScript ﬁles in it—prototype.js and scriptaculous.js, of course, but also effects.js and controls.js, which we will need for our demonstration.   LOCAL AUTOCOMPLETION  326  Our XHTML page is simple enough:  Download scriptaculous autocomplete local index.html  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">         Local autocompletion       <script type="text javascript"  src="scriptaculous.js?load=effects,controls">       Local autocompletion    Contact        Note how we just need to provide a bare-bones   as a container for the choice list. We do provide a CSS class name for it, though, because we plan to add custom styling later; for now, however, we don’t need any special styling in demo.css.  On to the scripting:  Download scriptaculous autocomplete local demo.js  var girls = [  'Anne-Julie Peschaud', 'Audrey Guillemenot', 'Aurore Jaballah', 'Clotilde Michel', 'Élodie Jaubert', 'Laurie Fatoux', 'Valérie Savalle'  'Corinne Dillingham', 'Diane Mellini', 'Erin Odenweller', 'Sandrine Daspet',  'Jes "Canllaith" Hall', 'Serpil Uren',  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  new Autocompleter.Local 'edtContact', 'contactChoices', girls ;                        ];  } ;   LOCAL AUTOCOMPLETION  327  Figure 16.1: Two autocompletions, no styling  There! No options, no ﬂuff—just the input ﬁeld, its completion con- tainer, and the data source. The whole construction syntax is actually as follows:  new Autocompleter.Local field, container, dataSource [, options]   Let’s ﬁre up our trusty browser and open the page. Figure 16.1 shows various stages of completion as we type initials. You’ll notice that de spite the matched typing being conveniently set apart with a   tag, the whole thing looks rather bare. The local completion process builds a nice, semantically correct unordered list    , but the lack of styling makes us look pretty dumb. So, let’s ﬁx this:  Download scriptaculous autocomplete local demo.css  h1 { font-size: 1.5em; }  div.autocomplete {  position: absolute; width: 250px;  * will be adjusted by script.aculo.us *  background-color: white; border: 1px solid 888; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;  } div.autocomplete ul {  list-style-type: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;  } div.autocomplete ul li.selected { background-color: ff9;} div.autocomplete ul li {  list-style-type: none; display: block; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: smaller; color: 444; margin: 0; padding: 0.1em; height: 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em; cursor: pointer;  }   LOCAL AUTOCOMPLETION  328  Figure 16.2: Same views, with “standard” styling  A couple notes about this:    The autocomplete class is not a mandatory name. You can use whatever class name you like on the   element in your mark- up  the element that will act as a container for your suggestions .    On the other hand, the selected class is a “magic” name. script.- aculo.us will apply this class automatically to the currently selec- ted suggestion  and update this as the user moves the selection, obviously .  Refresh the page and try again. It should look more like Figure 16.2. That’s much better indeed!  Customizing Local Completion The ﬁrst thing you can adjust is the maximum amount of visible choices  above which you’d have to scroll . It defaults to 10, but you can adjust this with the choices option.  The focus of local-completion options is the completion algorithm itself. By default, the search will be as follows:    Partial: it searches for the typed text at the beginning of any word in the completion choices. You can search only at the beginning of the whole choice text by setting the partialSearch option to false.  Also note that partial search will trigger only once a given amount of characters has been typed. This defaults to 2, which you can   LOCAL AUTOCOMPLETION  329  adjust with the partialChars option. Do not confuse partialChars with minChars. The latter has precedence, given that no completion whatsoever will trigger below its value. However, when the amount of typed characters is greater than or equal to minChars but below partialChars, you’ll get a nonpartial search  beginning of full-choice text only .    Preﬁx-only: only beginnings  of words or full texts  will be looked up. It’s generally the better way, but should you want to search anywhere in the choice text, set the fullSearch option to true.    Case-insensitive, which you can change by setting the ignoreCase  option to false.  I should also mention that the actual completion algorithm is per- formed by a method reference by the selector option. Such a method gets passed the current Autocompleter.Local instance and is responsi- ble for building the appropriate     markup and returning it. The default value for this option implements all the options discussed in this section, and you should generally not need to implement your own.  Changing the List of Completions Every so often, someone will pop up on the mailing list asking how they can change the list of completions for a local autocompleter without destroying it and constructing it anew.  There’s no ofﬁcial support for this, but so far the reference to your JavaScript array has always been stored in an array option in the Auto- completer.Local object. Changing this property to reference your new array of choices does the trick:  var ac = new Autocompleter.Local 'edtContact', 'contactChoices', girls ;    ...    And when you'd want to switch to another list of choices: ac.options.array = guys;  Once again, this is not ofﬁcially supported, because array is not inten- ded to be part of a “public” API, but it has been untouched since the object ﬁrst appeared in script.aculo.us and certainly works well enough.   16.3 Getting Ajaxy  GETTING AJAXY  330  The other data source mode available is, of course, Ajax, which lets you get completion choices from a remote source  your server side . The construction syntax is similar to the local variant, except the data source is not speciﬁed as a JavaScript array anymore but as the URL to your server-side completion logic:  new Ajax.Autocompleter element, container, url [, options]   Your server side gets passed one parameter, which defaults to the input ﬁeld’s name= attribute and holds the typed characters. The server code is then responsible for producing a list of completion choices using the same format built internally by local completion: an unordered list of choices, expressed as a   element with its   items.  Automatically Displaying an Indicator Because we’re going through Ajax and having a round-trip to the server side, completion might not be instantaneous. As always, letting the user know processing is going on behind the scenes is a good idea. When dealing manually with such objects as Ajax.Updater, we had to manually show and hide an indicator element on our page from the onCreate and onComplete callbacks. This indicator element was usually an   somewhere, holding a spinner or progress bar of some sort.  Autocompleter.Base acknowledges this common need with a custom indicator option that holds the DOM reference or ID of our indicator ele- ment and will automatically show and hide it appropriately. The option is originally undeﬁned, and whenever it is false-equivalent, it is simply ignored. It’s available to all autocompleters, but local completion rarely needs it, being usually fast enough. . . .  A First Example Let’s work up a simple Ajax example. We’ll need all the stuff from our local demo, but we’ll adjust the web page’s title and heading and the demo script. The new web page says this:  Download scriptaculous autocomplete ajax index.html  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">         AJAX autocompletion    GETTING AJAXY  331       <script type="text javascript"  src="scriptaculous.js?load=effects,controls">       AJAX autocompletion    Ruby library                              } ;  And the script simply goes like this:  Download scriptaculous autocomplete ajax demo.js  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  new Ajax.Autocompleter 'edtLibName', 'libChoices', ' completions' ;  Now we need a server side to access this page and serve the data source URL   completions . As always, we’ll get by with a short Ruby script. To give it some appeal, I suggest we have it complete on all installed Ruby libraries:  Download scriptaculous autocomplete ajax server.rb  Line 1  !  usr bin env ruby  require 'cgi' require 'erb' require 'webrick' include WEBrick  template_text = File.read 'suggestions.rhtml'  suggestions = ERB.new template_text   server = HTTPServer.new :Port => 8042  server.mount ' ', HTTPServlet::FileHandler, '.'   server.mount_proc ' completions'  do request, response  name_start = request.query['libName'] suffix = " {Regexp.escape name_start }*.rb"  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15   GETTING AJAXY  332  20  25  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  libs = $LOAD_PATH.map { dir  Dir.glob dir + suffix, File::FNM_CASEFOLD .map { f  File.basename f, '.rb'   }  }.flatten.sort.uniq response['Content-Type'] = 'text html' response.body = suggestions.result binding   trap 'INT'  { server.shutdown }  end  server.start  For the non-Rubyists among you, this code probably calls for a few explanations:    The escaping on line 16 lets us type any character that would hold a special meaning for ﬁlename globbing  such as ? or *  without messing up the ﬁle searching algorithm.    In Ruby, the $LOAD_PATH variable  used on line 17  holds all the directories in the ﬁle system where Ruby libraries are known to be found. We’ll take each such directory and produce a list of libraries based on the Ruby ﬁles each contains.    The per-directory ﬁle search actually happens on line 18, with the Dir.glob    method. It produces a list of ﬁlenames, which our map    strips of their directory and extension, leaving only the base library name.    In the end we get an array of arrays of strings, which we want to turn into a ﬂat, sorted array with no duplicates. That’s what the chained calls on line 21 do.  This is one of these small code pieces that makes me love Ruby. If you’re a Java, .NET, or PHP person  just to name a few prevalent technologies , just compare it to the equivalent code in your language. . . . I mean, this is expressive  that is, both concise and very readable !  The suggestions.rhtml template ﬁle is rather concise, too:  Download scriptaculous autocomplete ajax suggestions.rhtml                 Time to try it. Shut down any running server script you may still have, and run this one  the usual ruby server.rb command line . Then navigate   GETTING AJAXY  333  Figure 16.3: Ajax completion over Ruby libraries  to http:  localhost:8042 , and type a letter. You’ll get something like the results in Figure 16.3.  I’ll let you play around a bit with all of the alphabet. I know, you can’t help it; I know the libraries, and I still couldn’t refrain from trying it out myself.  Customizing the Request Parameters You can specify a method option for the underlying Ajax.Request object. It does default to ’post’, as usual, but you may want to make that a ’get’. After all, you’re only fetching data.  You can tweak the parameters sent to the server side in a variety of ways:    A single parameter contains the currently typed text; its name defaults to the input ﬁeld’s name= attribute. You can change this parameter’s name with the paramName option.    If you want to dynamically craft the passed parameters, you can provide a callback method with the callback  ahem  option. It will get passed both the input ﬁeld and the current parameter text. It returns the new parameter text  properly encoded, like any query string in a URL .    You can specify static parameters to be passed no matter what  cumulative to the result of a potential callback result  with the parameters option, which must be a properly encoded query string fragment.   USING RICH-MARKUP CHOICES  334  16.4 Using Rich-Markup Choices  For instance, here’s a call that would pass a dynamic timestamp and a couple static extra parameters to the default parameter:  new Ajax.Autocompleter 'edtLibName', 'libChoices', ' completions', {  method: 'get', parameters: 'static1=value1', callback: function editor, paramText  {  return paramText + '&stamp=' + new Date  .getTime  ;  Assuming an input ﬁeld with name="libName", completion on typing “ab” would issue a request URL something like the following:  GET  completions?libName=ab&stamp=1178039580757&static1=value1  As you can see, you can tailor the underlying request to your needs with no hassle.  So far we’ve stayed basic in our content model. Our options used only raw text within the conﬁnes of their   element. Often enough, how- ever, we’ll want to provide the user with more than just one text; addi- tional details could be useful, such as images, dates, and whatnot.  The trouble is, autocompletion will collect all text nodes within the selected  . As an example, the following markup:     Élodie Jaubert    Heritage consultant   . . . would produce the completion text “Élodie JaubertHeritage consul- tant.” Damn. What is a web developer to do? Well, you have two options to deal with rich contents in your list items.  The ﬁrst option is that you can embrace conventions and mark any accessory text with the CSS class informal. Any element with this class will automatically get ignored. The previous markup could be adjusted easily:     Élodie Jaubert    Heritage consultant   } } ;               AUTOCOMPLETING MULTIPLE VALUES IN ONE FIELD  335  That was easy. However, this quickly gets ugly when your content model gets rich enough. All elements but the one with your intended comple- tion text are marked with this CSS class, which feels bloated. So, you can turn the idea on its head and specify a CSS class to identify the elements you want to include. This is done with the select option. The markup could go like this:           Élodie Jaubert   Heritage consultant   heritage@example.com   Cell:  478  555-1234   The autocompleter construction would then just need to state  here for Ajax completion  the following:  new Ajax.Autocompleter 'edtContact', 'contactChoices', ' completions', {  select: 'contactName'  } ;  We’ll go through a combined example in a moment.  Note that both ways of selecting completion contents are mutually ex- clusive. If you specify a select option, informal classes won’t be taken into account, and the elements they tag will still be included if within a selected container element. For instance, with the previous completion constructor call, the following markup:     Élodie Jaubert   Oops!            . . . would indeed produce “Élodie Jaubert Oops!”  16.5 Autocompleting Multiple Values in One Field  Autocompleting needs not be restricted to only one value per ﬁeld. You may very well let the user type multiple values, usually separated by one or more characters among a predeﬁned list of separators  for exam- ple, commas, spaces, or line breaks . Perhaps you’re offering to free- type a list of tags for an article or image or want to help with the typing of keywords for a search.   AUTOCOMPLETING MULTIPLE VALUES IN ONE FIELD  336  The option that lets you deal with this is tokens. You just need to set it to an array of delimiter characters, and the completion mechanism will automatically work with the latest token  text part —either the only one or the one past the latest delimiter. It’s especially useful when you’re working with a multiple-line ﬁeld and want to work on a per-line basis, because you need to put only the newline character  ’\n’  in the allowed separators.  tokens defaults to an empty array, effectively disabling the multiple- value mode. If you need only one delimiter character, you can set it to a single string; you don’t have to bother with a single-element array.  Let’s adapt our Ajax completion example to use a few more options, including tokens. We’ll adjust our web page to use a multiline input ﬁeld, that is, a  :  Download scriptaculous autocomplete advanced index.html  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">         Advanced autocompletion       <script type="text javascript"  src="scriptaculous.js?load=effects,controls">       Advanced autocompletion    Ruby libraries                                Notice that we adjusted the id= and name= attributes accordingly. On the server side, we’d like to provide richer content, with not only library names but, for each one, its last modiﬁcation time and its ﬁle size in bytes. To store all these data, we’ll create a simple LibInfo class and use   AUTOCOMPLETING MULTIPLE VALUES IN ONE FIELD  337  its constructor to extract all the necessary information from the original File object:  Download scriptaculous autocomplete advanced server.rb  Line 1  !  usr bin env ruby  require 'cgi' require 'erb' require 'webrick' include WEBrick  class LibInfo  attr_reader :name, :mtime, :size  def initialize name   @name = File.basename name, '.rb'  @mtime = File.mtime name  @size = File.size name   15  end  end  20  end  def   other   self.name   other.name  5  10  25  30  35  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  template_text = File.read 'suggestions.rhtml'  suggestions = ERB.new template_text   server = HTTPServer.new :Port => 8042  server.mount ' ', HTTPServlet::FileHandler, '.'   server.mount_proc ' completions'  do request, response  name_start = request.query['libName'] suffix = " {Regexp.escape name_start }*.rb" libs = $LOAD_PATH.map { dir  Dir.glob dir + suffix, File::FNM_CASEFOLD .map { f LibInfo.new f  }  }.flatten.sort.uniq response['Content-Type'] = 'text html' response.body = suggestions.result binding   end  trap 'INT'  { server.shutdown }  40  server.start  The      method on line 17 is probably very weird-looking to the non- Rubyists among you. We call it the “Tie Fighter” operator. It’s used for sorting, as a comparator between two LibInfo objects. It simply makes sure they’re sorted by name. On line 32, notice that we simply map every File object we get to a new LibInfo object.   AUTOCOMPLETING MULTIPLE VALUES IN ONE FIELD  338  The new suggestions template is adjusted accordingly:  Download scriptaculous autocomplete advanced suggestions.rhtml               <%= lib.mtime.strftime   '%m %d %Y %H:%M:%S'  %>      bytes          We rely on the usual strftime    method  well known to C and PHP devel- opers, for instance  to format the modiﬁcation time. Of course, these new CSS classes call for custom styling, and the container   needs a bit of revamping to comfortably host this extra information:  Download scriptaculous autocomplete advanced demo.css  h1 { font-size: 1.5em; }  div.autocomplete {  position: absolute; width: 250px;  * will be adjusted by script.aculo.us *  background-color: white; border: 1px solid 888; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;  } div.autocomplete ul {  list-style-type: none; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;  } div.autocomplete ul li.selected { background-color: ff9;} div.autocomplete ul li {  list-style-type: none; display: block; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: smaller; color: 444; margin: 0; padding: 0.1em; height: 3.5em; cursor: pointer;  border: 0.1em solid gray; padding: 0.1em; height: 4em;  } edtLibNames {  } div.libMTime, div.libSize {  font-size: 80%; color: 444;  div.libMTime {  margin: 0.2ex 0 0 2ex;  }  }   REACTING TO COMPLETION WITH CALLBACKS  339  div.libName {  font-weight: bold;  div.libSize {  margin: 0 0 0.5em 2ex;  }  }  Finally, we need to adjust our Ajax.Autocompleter call to make use of these new options. It’s still fairly concise:  new Ajax.Autocompleter 'edtLibNames', 'libChoices', ' completions', {  Download scriptaculous autocomplete advanced demo.js  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  method: 'get', paramName: 'libName', tokens: [',', '\n'], select: 'libName'  } ;  } ;  Notice that this time, we make a cleaner use of HTTP methods by using a GET, which is more appropriate to data fetching. Because our input ﬁeld’s original name  its name= attribute  is now a plural, but we’re completing a single name, we also override the parameter name used in the Ajax completion calls.  To allow multiple values both on a per-line basis and on the same line  by using commas , we deﬁne a two-element tokens option. And to only use the library’s name  not its details  for the completion, we specify a CSS class name for the content fragment holding the data we’re interested in.  Well, how about testing it? Stop any running server script, run this one, load it up with no cache in your browser  still http:  localhost:8042  , and start typing values, accepting completions, going multiline, or using commas. . . . In the end, you should get results like the montage in Figure 16.4, on the next page.  16.6 Reacting to Completion with Callbacks  Autocompleters come with a few callbacks that let you customize how the completion list is revealed or hidden, get notiﬁed once a comple- tion gets used, or even replace the standard text extraction mechanism when a completion is selected.   REACTING TO COMPLETION WITH CALLBACKS  340  Figure 16.4: Advanced completion: tokens and rich contents  Here’s a quick rundown, in chronological  triggering  order:  onShow  In charge of positioning and revealing the choice list. You should rarely need to change it. The default behavior positions the com- pletion container under the input ﬁeld, aligns its width, and makes it fade in pretty fast  0.15"  with a Effect.Appear. This takes two arguments: the input ﬁeld and the completion container  the two ﬁrst arguments you passed at construction time .  updateElement  In charge of reacting to a   completion choice being accepted in order to actually complete the input ﬁeld’s value. This is very sel- dom overridden, because it replaces the default behavior, which is responsible for a hell of a lot—dealing with richly structured contents  the informal class and the select option , handling tok- enization  tokens option , actually updating the input ﬁeld’s value, and eventually calling the afterUpdateElement callback.   REACTING TO COMPLETION WITH CALLBACKS  341  If you deﬁne this, you’re very much on your own. Most options and behaviors are dealt with by the default processing, which your callback replaces entirely. You would get only one argument: the accepted   element  but you would run bound to the auto- completer object, so you could access, say, this.options and this. element .  In short, be careful with this!  afterUpdateElement  Undoubtedly the most-often used callback. It is triggered by the default updateElement behavior once the value was completed by an accepted choice. It takes two arguments: the input ﬁeld and the accepted   element. This is what lets you react to completions in the easiest manner.  onHide  In charge of taking the choice list away. Just like onShow, it’s rarely overridden. The default behavior just fades out in 0.15 sec- ond. It takes the same arguments as onShow.  What We Just Learned  Providing dynamic completion of text input, be it from a page-local or, more often, remote data source through Ajax, is a breeze with script.- aculo.us. Our completion items can be content-rich, and we can hook onto the completion extraction process when an item is picked so as to complete more than just the visible editor. Use cases for completion- assisted input are numerous and sometimes unexpected. Be on the lookout for situations where they can help your users!  Here’s a quick recap:    The most common form of autocompletion is through Ajax, thanks to Ajax.Autocompleter. However, a local variant, based on Java- Script arrays embedded in our code, is also possible.    We can easily tune when and how the completion process triggers  by adjusting a few options, such as minChars and frequency.    Ajax-based completion requires a     structure as a re- sponse, but the contents of the list items can be as rich as we need. Options let us easily extract only part of the selected item for the actual text completion.   REACTING TO COMPLETION WITH CALLBACKS  342    Callbacks let us augment the basic completion process. For exam- ple, we can grab hidden data from the selected element to populate both visual and hidden form ﬁelds.    It is possible to complete not just one but multiple values in a  single ﬁeld, thanks to the tokens option.  Neuron Workout  Time to think harder!    When is it more practical to rely on the informal CSS class as  opposed to specifying a select option?    What situations can you see where local completion is a good ﬁt?    How could we tweak an Ajax.Autocompleter call so that it can deal with a resultset that is not a     structure? For example, how could we complete based on an Atom feed or an XML export of a MySQL schema?   Chapter 17 Building DOM Fragments the Easy Way: Builder  Frequently, you need to inject some new content into your page’s docu- ment. Depending on the complexity of the content and potential brow- ser quirks, you’ll choose between three ways to do this:    If producing the markup text for your contents is easy enough, you’ll usually want to go with Element extension methods such as insert   , replace   , or update   . We covered these back in Sec- tion 7.2, Replacing vs. Inserting, on page 156. However, because such methods internally rely  most of the time  on the innerHTML property, which is currently not quite standard- ized normative and has a few issues on Firefox  prior to version 2, if I’m not mistaken , you may hit browser inconsistencies once in a while  especially when dealing with   and   in my humble experience . In some cases, you may also ﬁnd it easier  or more natural  to manually build the DOM elements instead of composing XHTML markup.    When manual element construction is what you’re going for, simple needs can be addressed by the new Element ...  syntax we discussed in Section 7.2, Lightweight DOM Element Creation, on page 156. Unfortunately, this facility currently will not let you specify text or nested elements as content for the element you are creating. You are limited to the element’s tag name and its attribute list.   BUILDING EXPLICITLY  344    That leaves us with a large array of use cases, where we need to create actual DOM trees  or just hit a snag with innerHTML-based ways and need to revert to good ol’ DOM interfaces under the hood . This is what Builder is for. It lets you quickly specify the construction of DOM fragments, to any depth and degree of complexity you’d need, with a rather con- cise, expressive syntax.  You’ll need the builder.js module. So, your script.aculo.us loading will look, at minimum, like this:      17.1 Building Explicitly  Let’s start with the fundamental building block: Builder.node   . You can call it in a variety of ways, but using a single statement block requires some thinking to decipher it, so I’ll use one line per variant:  Builder.node tagName  → Element Builder.node tagName, attributes  → Element Builder.node tagName, text  child  [ child, ... ]  → Element Builder.node tagName, attributes, text  child  [ child, ... ]  → Element  Starting Easy: Just One Element This is the safest way and lets you explicitly specify every tag name, attribute, and parent-child relationship. You always start by passing a tag name. If you stop there, you’ll get a rather raw element, but this is, in many subtle ways, superior to the usual document.createElement   call you would normally do with the DOM. Indeed, there are stealthy bugs across browsers when you attempt to create, out of the blue, cer- tain HTML elements this way.  Builder.node    tries a variety of approaches, based on the innerHTML property and synthetic parent nodes, using document.createElement   only as a fallback. This results in maximum portability, with one excep- tion. In Firefox prior to version 1.5, you will not be able to create   and   elements this way, because of an acknowl- edged Firefox bug. But then, Firefox users usually have at least version 1.5. . . .   BUILDING EXPLICITLY  345  Of course, Builder.node    does not stop at the tag name but lets you specify attributes, simple text as element contents, or one or more chil- dren elements  which can, naturally, be Builder.node    calls themselves .  Attributes are provided as a hash, usually an anonymous object. When the property name is a JavaScript reserved word  two cases come to mind: class= and for= , you will have to use the DOM property name instead  respectively className and htmlFor . Otherwise, use the attri- bute names in the case mandated by your document’s DTD  for exam- ple, lowercase for XHTML . There are a number of issues with native attribute manipulation, which are smoothed over, once again, by the method’s algorithm.  With attributes available, Builder.node    is already way more interest- ing than document.createElement  , which does not support shorthand attribute creation in its ofﬁcial syntax. Here are a few example calls:  Builder.node 'a', { href: 'http:  script.aculo.us' }  Builder.node 'label', { htmlFor: 'edtLogin', accesskey: 'L' }  Builder.node 'p', { className: 'intro' }   When you create a nonempty element that has a textual content, you just need to pass the text as the last argument:     Text child Builder.node 'h1', 'Builder rules'     Attributes, text child Builder.node 'a', { href: 'http:  prototypejs.org' }, 'Prototype!'   Elements Within Elements Textual contents are nice, but you may very well want to quickly create a small DOM fragment, with nested elements and all. If there’s only one child node, just pass it directly, be it text or another element; if there are many, pass an array. A few examples will be clearer than further explanations, I guess:     Element child Builder.node 'h1', Builder.node 'code', 'Builder'      Multiple children Builder.node 'h1', [Builder.node 'code', 'Builder' , ' rules']     Attributes, element child Builder.node 'p', { className: 'submission' },  Builder.node 'input', { type: 'submit', value: 'Sign in' }       Attributes, multiple children Builder.node 'a',  { href: 'http:  prototypejs.org api ajax update' }, [Builder.node 'code', 'Ajax.Updater' , ' documentation']    BUILDING EXPLICITLY  346  In the source code archive for this book, you’ll ﬁnd a demo page that lets you dynamically try all these example calls. You’ll ﬁnd it in the code scriptaculous builder directory in the archive. By using a DOM inspector such as Firebug’s, you’ll be able to inspect the DOM for the resulting elements easily enough.  Method Dumping: Still Explicit, But Shorter If you feel like shortening your code and if your personal sense of code aesthetics tolerates it, you can equip any object, including the global scope  that is, the window object  with convenience methods for just about every XHTML tag. These convenience methods are really just wrappers around Builder.node   , with the ﬁrst argument preﬁlled.  For instance, instead of doing this:  Builder.node 'h1', Builder.node 'code', 'Builder'    . . . you would do this:  H1 CODE 'Builder'    In the same vein, the following snippet:  Builder.node 'h1', [Builder.node 'code', 'Builder' , ' rules']   . . . would become this:  H1 [CODE 'Builder' , ' rules']   As a ﬁnal example, the two following calls:  Builder.node 'p', { className: 'submission' },  Builder.node 'input', { type: 'submit', value: 'Sign in' }    Builder.node 'a',  { href: 'http:  prototypejs.org api ajax update' }, [Builder.node 'code', 'Ajax.Updater' , ' documentation' ]   . . . would be turned into this:  P { className: 'submission' }, INPUT { type: 'submit',  value: 'Sign in'}    A { href: 'http:  prototypejs.org api ajax update' },  [CODE 'Ajax.Updater' , 'documentation']   So, how do we achieve this? Simply by calling Builder.dump   —just once, at some point before we start using these shortcuts. The method takes an optional scope argument:  Builder.build  [scope = window]   So, calling it with no argument sprinkles the global scope with those uppercase methods. Uppercase was chosen so the risk of conﬂict with   USING AN  X HTML REPRESENTATION  347  existing methods would be lower; indeed, if a method exists in the scope with one of the “dumped” names, it will be overridden by the node- building one.  But you can refrain from polluting the global namespace and still gain some concision by using an object of your choice as the namespace. Just look at the following code:  var B = {} Builder.dump B ; B.H1 B.CODE 'Builder'    When using dump   , I certainly prefer this way. . . . You can even simply alias to Builder so as to keep a uniform interface:  var B = Builder; Builder.dump B ; B.H1 'Builder'       B.node 'h1', 'Builder'   17.2 Using an  X HTML Representation  I personally like the structured way of Builder.node   , which is retained by the shortcuts you can get through Builder.dump   , but sometimes the fragment you’re looking to build is way shorter to express using XHTML syntax. For instance, consider the following simple fragment:   Introduction to the  Builder  object   Then look at its building, either with node    or convenience methods:  Builder.node 'h1', { id: 'intro' }, [  'Introduction to the ', Builder.node 'code', 'Builder' , ' object']      or... H1 { id: 'intro' }, ['Introduction to the ', CODE 'Builder' , ' object']   Sure, anyone can argue about the relative merits of each variant, but when you do ﬁnd yourself needing—or wanting—to work based on an XHTML fragment, you can use Builder.build   :  Builder.build html  → Element  There’s one gotcha: the fragment you pass must use an overall con- tainer element. If it has many top-level elements, you’ll get only the ﬁrst one. Here’s an example:     Single container element: OK Builder.build   ' Introduction to the  Builder  object '      Multiple top-level elements: woops! Builder.build ' Intro  So the story goes&8230; '   We'll only get the   back!   USING AN  X HTML REPRESENTATION  348  Builder.build    works very much like Element.update   , which we dis- cussed on page 139, except it doesn’t need an element to work inside of. Indeed, it does entirely rely on Element.update   , which it uses on a temporary   it creates outside the page’s DOM. So, whatever Element.update    can deal with, Builder.build    can.  Wow, after the power tools we covered in the previous chapters, this one was quick enough to walk through. Refreshing, wouldn’t you say? Just the right length for a public-transport commute. . . . The next chapter is about in-place editing, which lets us take just about any text on our pages, edit it on the ﬂy, and save it through Ajax. It’s so Web 2.0!   Chapter 18 In-Place Editing  18.1 What’s In-Place Editing Exactly?  In-place editing is about taking noneditable content, such as a  ,  , or  , and letting the user edit its contents by simply clicking it. This turns the static element into an editable zone  either single- line or multiline  and pops up submit and cancel buttons  or links, depending on your options  for the user to commit or roll back the modiﬁcation. It then synchronizes the edit on the server side through Ajax and makes the element noneditable again.  In-place editing is one of the hallmarks of Web 2.0–style applications, which aim to make the user more and more participative in the contents and reduce the barrier to contribution and writing. You could use it for customizing the title of a per-user portal page, editing “notes” sprinkled throughout the screen space by the user, and so on.  What script.aculo.us Brings to the Table Two classes focus on in-place editing: Ajax.InPlaceEditor and Ajax. InPlaceCollectionEditor. The former one is the most commonly used and relies on free-typing text ﬁelds for content modiﬁcation. The latter one, which specializes the former, limits the options by using a drop-down list from which our users can pick the value they want.  As their names imply, both use Ajax to synchronize the new content on the server. Both come with a wealth of options that give you ﬁne- grained control over the look and feel of the resulting UI. We’ll tackle these capabilities by theme in the following sections.   WHAT’S IN-PLACE EDITING EXACTLY?  350  Careful About Versions: Code Refactoring  In version 1.8, the two classes responsible for in-place edit- ing underwent massive refactoring, and their public API changed a bit, especially where available options and call- backs are concerned.  The former code was mostly a third-party contribution, which so far had worked well enough. Unfortunately, the code had then grown organically and had not kept very well in sync with new, better Prototypish ways. It had become a rather haphazard collection of methods with more than a few inconsistencies and odd behaviors under speciﬁc cir- cumstances. Hence, it was refactored; it was close to a full rewrite.  Step by Step with In-Place Editors Before diving in with examples and the numerous features, I think it’s better if we take a moment to stand back and get the big picture. Here’s a surface rundown on the successive stages of an in-place editor’s life:  1. First, you make an element in-place editable. As always with script.aculo.us, it’s the job of a single call, in our case the con- struction of the proper wrapper object based on the relevant ele- ment.  2. From then on, when users hover over our element with the mouse, a few features mark this element as in-place editable. All of these are customizable to your needs, but here are the defaults:    Hovering in immediately highlights the element.   Lingering will display the element’s title= in a tooltip, which is    Hovering out dehighlights with a quick fade-out  aesthetics,  set by default to Click to edit.  my friend, aesthetics. . .  .  3. Clicking the element enters edit mode. A proper   is created on the ﬂy, with an appropriate editor UI  for example, a single-line text ﬁeld, a drop-down list of possible choices, submission and cancellation buttons or links, and so on . Although rarely used, an option exists to bind click and hovering listeners to another element instead of the content-containing element, if you want to dissociate them.   WHAT’S IN-PLACE EDITING EXACTLY?  351  If you use an alternate form of the contents on the server side and just generate its XHTML representation to produce this content, you can elect to load the “source” text through Ajax and have the user edit this original content  for example, Textile1 or Markdown2 text instead of actual XHTML .  4. Editing takes place. In regular mode, hitting Return  on single- line editors  or triggering the submission control  button or link  commits it; conversely, hitting Esc or triggering the cancellation control reverts it. However, you may elect not to have any OK cancel controls. Sub- mitting takes place when hitting Return or getting out of the ﬁeld  for example, by clicking elsewhere or hitting Tab  , and reverting is still bound to Esc . This is a popular behavior, because it unclut- ters the editing area.  5. If the editing is canceled, the original content is restored. If it’s committed, the editing UI goes away and is replaced by a message stating that the modiﬁcation is being saved; when the modiﬁcation is saved, the original element reappears, with updated content. If you used an alternate syntax for the edited content, the server will have sent the XHTML conversion for your static element to use instead of the “source” text.  6. The element undergoes a quick highlight effect to state its recent  modiﬁcation.  We’ll explore these steps, and the various options and callbacks avail- able for our customizing pleasure, in the following sections.  Using in-Place Editors in Our Code You’ll need the controls.js module, which also contains, as you’ll no doubt recall, the autocompletion stuff. Because default behaviors for in-place editing heavily rely on the Effect.Highlight object, you’ll also need to include effects.js. So your script.aculo.us loading will look, at minimum, like this:  <script type="text javascript"  src="scriptaculous.js?load=effects,controls">   1. http:  www.textism.com tools textile  2. http:  daringﬁreball.net projects markdown    A SIMPLE EXAMPLE  352  18.2 A Simple Example  It’s time we start playing with this. We’ll need the usual ﬁles: Prototype, the required script.aculo.us modules and the loader, and our custom CSS and JavaScript ﬁles. Because we are talking about in-place editing, that means we expect the user to be able to modify content that will later be served again. So, we’ll use template ﬁles and serve our demo page dynamically, instead of with a static index.html ﬁle.  For starters, here is our template ﬁle, index.rhtml:  Download scriptaculous ipe simple index.rhtml  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">         Simple in-place editing       <script type="text javascript"  src="scriptaculous.js?load=effects,controls">       Simple in-place editing                  The CSS could just as well be missing, because it retains only our usual   downplay:  Download scriptaculous ipe simple demo.css  h1 { font-size: 1.5em; }  We’ll go with all the defaults here, so activating in-place editing will be extremely concise:  Download scriptaculous ipe simple demo.js  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  new Ajax.InPlaceEditor 'freeZone', ' update' ;  } ;  Neat, isn’t it? It’s short and to the point. The constructor syntax is actually the following:  new Ajax.InPlaceEditor element, url [, options]    . . . but we don’t use any options yet. The ﬁnal piece for our puzzle is the server script, of course. Here it is: Download scriptaculous ipe simple server.rb  A SIMPLE EXAMPLE  353  Line 1  !  usr bin env ruby  require 'cgi' require 'erb' require 'webrick' include WEBrick  5  10  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  20  end  25  end  template_text = File.read 'index.rhtml'  template = ERB.new template_text   server = HTTPServer.new :Port => 8042  server.mount ' ', HTTPServlet::FileHandler, '.'   editableHTML =  15  'Click here to edit with  Ajax.InPlaceEditor &8230;'  server.mount_proc ' home'  do request, response  response['Content-Type'] = 'text html' response.body = template.result binding   server.mount_proc ' update'  do request, response  editableHTML = request.query['value'] response.body = editableHTML  trap 'INT'  { server.shutdown }  server.start Note the default content, on line 15. More important, note the code on line 24. This round-trip is a bit overkill here, because we do not use any alternative syntax for the content, and the client side could go with the raw content typed in by the user. But we went with all the defaults, which assume the server will return the ﬁnal content. After all, even with no alternative syntax, we could very well strip speciﬁc tags, or limit the length, or whatever. It’s your code on the server. You can implement whatever validation logic you want!  Now that we have everything in place, kill any running example server you may still have around, and run this the usual way  ruby server.rb . Figure 18.1, on the next page, is a montage of the successive stages in using our simple in-place editor: basic, hovering, editing, and edited. You won’t notice the “saving” stage because we’re running against a local server that, not doing anything long, responds too fast for this step to linger at all.   HOW CAN WE TWEAK THE AJAX PERSISTENCE?  354  Figure 18.1: Simple in-place editing in action  18.3 How Can We Tweak the Ajax Persistence?  First, we need to know what the defaults are. Basically, we rely on a call to Ajax.Updater, with our element as the success container, no speciﬁc Ajax options  so all the defaults of Ajax.Updater apply; for instance, we’re using asynchronous post , and two parameters: a value parameter with our editable ﬁeld’s value and an editorId parameter with the id= of our original element  unless it doesn’t have any, in which case this second parameter is absent .  We can customize quite a handful of things here:    We can change the name of the parameter holding the ﬁeld’s value  using the paramName option  defaults to ’value’ .    We can change the whole series of parameters  except for the edi- torId one, which is handled internally  by replacing the default call- back, er, callback, with our own. The default one simply goes like this: function form  {  return Form.serialize form ;  } We can provide our own logic. It will actually be passed two argu- ments: the synthesized   element and the editable ﬁeld’s value  as retrieved by the $F    method, which we discussed on page 49 . Using this, you could add any extra parameters you need, transform the passed value, and so on.    You can provide any options you want for the Ajax call with the ajaxOptions option, which defaults to the following simple set: {evalScripts: true}.   CUSTOMIZING THE APPEARANCE  355    Finally, you can tell the in-place editing mechanism that the server won’t return a ﬁnalized markup by setting the htmlResponse option to false  defaults to true . The system will then revert to using an Ajax.Request object, which can still autoevaluate JavaScript-typed results  see Section 9.2, Other Things Our Ajax.Request Can Do, on page 205 for more details on this . More generally, you can pass your own callbacks  for example, onComplete to deal with any response text you’d send . Such a callback must be speciﬁed at the regular options level, not in ajaxOptions.  18.4 Customizing the Appearance  There’s a lot you can do to tailor the appearance of in-place editors to your needs: buttons or links  or none! , additional texts, styling, exter- nal controls, and callbacks that let you add custom logic, including visual effects, to various stages of the editor’s life cycle.  Buttons vs. Links As you noticed, by default, you get an OK button and a cancel link. This is the original choice, made back when the dinosaurs still roamed the earth. You can customize this in a variety of ways:    The okControl and cancelControl options each can take three val- ues: ’button’, ’link’, and false. The latter choice removes the respec- tive widget, pure and simple. Respective defaults are, obviously enough, ’button’ and ’link’.    You can change the text of the buttons or links with the okText and cancelText options, which default to ’ok’ and ’cancel’, respectively.   You can go bare and strip both controls, which leaves you with the keyboard hooks on Return and Esc . This alone, however, is a risky choice, because plenty of users may not hit any of these keys. So, you can make sure the modiﬁcation is commit- ted as soon as the focus leaves the editable ﬁeld  for example, our user clicks elsewhere . Simply set the submitOnBlur option to true  defaults to false . Of course, if this option is enabled, OK cancel controls become entirely useless; clicking them would ﬁrst cause a focus loss, which would immediately trigger submission of the new content anyway.  We’ll see variants based on these options, and a few more, in the fol- lowing section.   CUSTOMIZING THE APPEARANCE  356  Additional Text In addition to adjusting how submission and cancellation are triggered, you can insert custom text before, between, and after the OK and cancel controls:    textBeforeControls appears before the ﬁrst visible control.    textBetweenControls appears between the OK and cancel controls,  but only if both are visible.    textAfterControls appears after the last visible control.  All three options default to the empty string.  As long as we’re talking about text-related options, you can customize the tooltip displayed when the mouse lingers over the static element. Just change the value of the clickToEditText option, which defaults to Click to edit.  Finally, you can change the text that appears, however brieﬂy, while the new content is being saved through Ajax. Use the savingText option for this, which defaults to Saving....  Let’s test a fair number of these options to see what the results look like. We’ll have a number of editors here, so we need to adjust our server script in order to maintain not one, but multiple, contents:  Download scriptaculous ipe variants server.rb  !  usr bin env ruby  require 'cgi' require 'erb' require 'webrick' include WEBrick  template_text = File.read 'index.rhtml'  template = ERB.new template_text   server = HTTPServer.new :Port => 8042  server.mount ' ', HTTPServlet::FileHandler, '.'   editableHTMLs = [  'Andrew Dupont', 'Mislav Marohnitextquotesinglec', 'Thomas Fuchs', 'Tobie Langel'  ]   CUSTOMIZING THE APPEARANCE  357  server.mount_proc ' home'  do request, response  response['Content-Type'] = 'text html' response.body = template.result binding   end  end  server.mount_proc ' update'  do request, response  sentContent = request.query['value'] request.query['editorId'] =~  ^freeZone \d+ $  index = $1.to_i - 1 editableHTMLs[index] = sentContent sleep 2 if index == 3  Simulate lag so we can see the custom text... response.body = sentContent  trap 'INT'  { server.shutdown }  server.start  Notice how the automatically added editorId parameter makes it easy to persist multiple contents. We won’t have anything special to do in the JavaScript to get that.  The template for our page adjusts accordingly:  Download scriptaculous ipe variants index.rhtml  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">         Variants on in-place editing       <script type="text javascript"  src="scriptaculous.js?load=effects,controls">            Variants on in-place editing     " class="editable">          We don’t apply any styling yet  that will be the topic of our next section , but we need to adjust the scripting in order to create in-place editors for each paragraph, with various option sets.   CUSTOMIZING THE APPEARANCE  358  Figure 18.2: Fiddling with controls and texts  Here’s how we do that:  Download scriptaculous ipe variants demo.js  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  new Ajax.InPlaceEditor 'freeZone1', ' update', {  cancelControl: 'button' } ;  new Ajax.InPlaceEditor 'freeZone2', ' update', {  okControl: 'link', textBetweenControls: ' '  } ; new Ajax.InPlaceEditor 'freeZone3', ' update', {  textBeforeControls: '[ ', textBetweenControls: ' - ', textAfterControls: ' ]'  } ; new Ajax.InPlaceEditor 'freeZone4', ' update', {  clickToEditText: 'You\'d better click on this!', savingText: 'Hang on a second, I\'m saving this...'  } ;  } ;  Figure 18.2 captures the state of our page with all editors enabled, save for the last one, which is saving  the server script simulates a two- second processing for this one, leaving us enough time to notice the custom text .  CSS Classes, Colors, and Other Style Properties In-place editors are a kind of widget, since they actually produce UI components on the page  the editor, its OK cancel controls, and so on . And widgets would be no good if they could not properly adapt to your application’s visual identity. Fortunately, you can rely on numerous CSS classes and several options to tune the editors’ appearance.   CUSTOMIZING THE APPEARANCE  359  The following CSS classes are deﬁned, which you can then deﬁne as you want in your style sheet:    inplaceeditor-form applies to the dynamically created forms that    editor_ok_button and editor_ok_link are used for OK controls, de-    editor_cancel_button and editor_cancel_link are used for cancel    editor_ﬁeld is used for the editor itself  in other words, the    wrap the edition controls.  pending on the type.  controls.  or   .    inplaceeditor-saving is used for the saving message, and we’ll see later that inplaceeditor-loading is used for the loading message when your editor uses an alternate text.  You can use your own class names for several of these but not all  and at some future point, you won’t be able to change these names at all, as I’ll discuss in a moment . Currently, the following options are available for specifying custom class names:    hoverClassName applies to editable elements when the mouse hov-  ers over them in noneditable mode. It has no default value.    formClassName is for  the wrapper  forms and defaults to    loadingClassName is for the loading status message, when you edit It defaults to  the raw content.  instead of    savingClassName is for the saving status message. It defaults to  inplaceeditor-form.  alternate text inplaceeditor-loading.  inplaceeditor-saving.  Finally, note that there is a size property, which lets you specify the “size” of the single-line editor ﬁeld, as per the old size= attribute. Most of the time, you’ll resort to CSS instead, which is much more ﬂexible and accurate.  Let’s adapt our previous example to use these styles. The CSS ﬁle grows a bit to become this:  Download scriptaculous ipe styled demo.css  h1 { font-size: 1.5em; }  .editable.hovered {  border: 1px dashed 880;  }   CUSTOMIZING THE APPEARANCE  360  form.first {  border: 3px solid silver; background: ddd; padding: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;  }  }  .inplaceeditor-saving {  height: 16px; padding-left: 20px; background: url  spinner.gif  no-repeat left center; font: italic smaller 16px sans-serif; color: gray;  Notice how it uses custom CSS classes, such as hovered and ﬁrst, along with default ones such as inplaceeditor-saving. The script adapts accordingly:  Download scriptaculous ipe styled demo.js  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  new Ajax.InPlaceEditor 'freeZone1', ' update', {  hoverClassName: 'hovered', formClassName: 'first'  } ; new Ajax.InPlaceEditor 'freeZone2', ' update', {  hoverClassName: 'hovered'  } ; new Ajax.InPlaceEditor 'freeZone3', ' update', {  hoverClassName: 'hovered'  } ; new Ajax.InPlaceEditor 'freeZone4', ' update', {  hoverClassName: 'hovered', savingText: 'Hang on, I\'m saving this...'  } ;  } ;  There’s nothing fancy here. And the server side remains unchanged. Now reload the example, making sure to bypass the browser’s cache to use the latest script and style sheet  on Firefox and Mozilla browsers, holding Shift while hitting the Refresh button will do that , and you’ll notice the new styling when hovering on paragraphs, activating the edi- tor for the ﬁrst one, or saving the last one. Figure 18.3, on the next page shows all these changes in one shot.  How Can We Use Different Styles for Different Editors?  You noticed that not all CSS class names could be customized, and I alluded to the fact that in some future version of script.aculo.us, the custom-class options will be stripped altogether.   CUSTOMIZING THE APPEARANCE  361  Figure 18.3: Styling editors  This is because you can achieve full customization results on a per- editor basis without these options. Each editor has its own form, and each form has an id= attribute.  So, you could rely on the same classes but within different ID contexts, which CSS makes easy to specify. The only question is, what’s an edi- tor’s form ID?  The single “bad case” is the one where your original element has no ID, and the options don’t include formId. Then the form won’t have an ID, and you won’t be able to tell it apart.  Now let’s say your original element has an ID, and you didn’t spec- ify a formId option  just like we did so far . Then the wrapper form’s ID is your element’s sufﬁxed by -inplaceeditor  for instance, over <p id="freeZone1">, you’ll get a   with id="freeZone1-inplaceeditor" . Note that if such an element already has the resulting ID, the ID won’t be used.  Finally, you can specify your own form ID using the formId option. Just pass whichever form ID you want. Be careful, though—this does not mean the system will build an editor within an existing  ! You will get a fresh   no matter what, right where the original element was.   CUSTOMIZING THE APPEARANCE  362  Pitching In with Callbacks Ajax.InPlaceEditor lets you hook in at all important times in order to customize the behavior of the widget. The following are all the deﬁned callbacks in  somewhat  chronological order:  onEnterHover  onLeaveHover  Triggered when the mouse starts hovering over the element  be- cause it is still in noneditable mode . This defaults to setting its inline style’s background color to Ajax.InPlaceEditor.DefaultOptions. highlightColor, which originally is ffff99  the usual light yellow . This takes the element as its single argument.  Triggered when the mouse stops hovering over the element  it gets out of the element’s “airspace” . This defaults to fading out the highlight Ajax.InPlaceEditor.DefaultOptions. highlightEndColor  which originally is ffffff , a full white  and ﬁnally restoring the original background color, if any. This takes the ele- ment as its single argument.  toward  color  onEnterEditMode  The editor UI was just created and activated. The semantics changed slightly compared to before the refactoring, where this got triggered before the editor UI was created. This takes the ele- ment as its single argument.  onFailure  An error occurred in the saving Ajax call. This defaults to show- ing an error message that includes the response’s text stripped bare of markup tags. This takes at least one argument: the XML- HttpRequest object that was used. If htmlResponse is true  its default value , the element will be passed as the second argument.  onComplete  The saving Ajax call completed, with or without error. This takes at least one argument—the XMLHttpRequest object that was used. If htmlResponse is true  its default value , the element will be passed as the second argument.  onLeaveEditMode  The element is visible again and updated if no error came up. This takes the element as its single argument.  As a minor note, before the recent refactoring of Ajax.InPlaceEditor, back- ground images in the various CSS classes  especially the loading- and   DEALING WITH MULTIPLE LINES  363  saving-related ones  got ignored after the ﬁrst use. This was because of a tiny misconﬁguration of internal Effect.Highlight objects, which is now ﬁxed. You can provide background images again, as our latest CSS ﬁle and as Figure 18.3 demonstrate.  Using an External Control Perhaps you want to provide an obvious means of editing. Indeed, for most users, it is not at all self-evident that your element is editable in-place: titles, paragraphs, and their lot are usually fairly static. By default, only the element itself reacts to hovering and clicking, but you may want to use “sidekicks” such as an associated Edit link or button, which will loudly  and proudly  proclaim to your users that something can be edited here.  If you want to use such associated controls, you’ll be happy with the externalControl option. Just have it reference the element  directly or by ID, as usual  that’s supposed to react to hovering and clicks. The element itself still reacts, but so does your associated component.  You may also want to require the user to click this external control in order to trigger the editing mode. By default, both the original ele- ment and the external control would work. You can use the external- ControlOnly option to limit triggering to the external control.  Changing Default Options There are a lot of defaults, and they may just not suit you all that well. For instance, perhaps all your failure callbacks should behave the same way. . . just not the default one. Or you’d like to get rid of highlights entirely. Or something.  To let you change these defaults, they are all centralized in the Ajax. InPlaceEditor.DefaultOptions object. You can alter them, and whenever you create a new Ajax.InPlaceEditor, it will use the current state of this object as defaults. Of course, the speciﬁc options you pass for this con- struction override the current defaults, as usual.  18.5 Dealing with Multiple Lines  So far we’ve used single-line editor ﬁelds. But sometimes the element you make in-place editable holds quite a lot of markup, and multiple- line editing would be preferable. How can we do this?   EDITING ALTERNATIVE TEXT  364  Well, it all hinges on two things: the rows option and whether there are line breaks  \r or \n: carriage returns or linefeed characters  in the content to edit.  If rows is at its default of 1 and there are no line breaks, you’ll get a single-line editor  an   element with type="text" . But if there are line breaks or rows is set to greater than 1, you’ll get multiple- line editing. If rows is 1, it is ignored in favor of the value stored in Ajax.InPlaceEditor.DefaultOptions.rowsAuto, which originally is 3.  The rows option governs the height of multiple-line editors; their width is governed by the cols option, which, lacking a default, is assumed to be 40 if missing. The reason there is no default value is that if there is no size option to set the width of single-line editors but there is a cols option, it will be used for single-line editors too. This is intended to help homogenize the width of a given editor over time, whether the content has multiple lines or not.  You should also know that when a multiple-line editor  technically a    is used, OK and cancel controls will appear below it, not next to it; a   element will be added right after the editor.  In a general manner, the logic for deciding when to use single- or multiple-line editors, along with how the content was transformed prior to putting it in the editors, has changed signiﬁcantly during the refac- toring. The new behavior is not entirely backward compatible but is thought to be much more useful and ﬂexible.  18.6 Editing Alternative Text  OK, now for a very cool moment—you can actually have your users edit alternate content, instead of the raw markup inside the element. For instance, perhaps you’re building some sort of wiki; although it’s ren- dered as XHTML, you’re using some simpler markup, such as Textile or Markdown, for the source text of articles and sections. The server side renders these into the XHTML seen on your pages but stores content using the simpler syntax.  You can do this all the way by having your in-place editors load the alternate—“source”—content when being activated and beneﬁt from the default htmlResponse mode in order to get the corresponding XHTML from the server side when saving to it.   EDITING ALTERNATIVE TEXT  365  All you need to do is use the loadTextURL option to specify the URL required to load the alternate content. It will automatically be passed an extra editorId parameter, just like the saving operation detailed in Sec- tion 18.3, How Can We Tweak the Ajax Persistence?, on page 354. How- ever, it will use a GET method by default, instead of POST  as opposed to the behavior prior to the recent refactoring , unless your ajaxOptions option explicitly contains a method option that says otherwise.  When loading alternate text, the editor’s content is temporarily set to the text speciﬁed in the loadingText option, which defaults to Loading..., and the editor and submission systems   Return key, OK control  are disabled. The whole form can be styled, during loading, with the CSS class speciﬁed in loadingClassName, which defaults to inplaceeditor- loading.3  As soon as the alternate content is retrieved, it is put in the editor, and the whole editor UI is enabled again.  This certainly calls for an example. Textile and Markdown are both readily available as gems  Ruby packages  but are not part of the stan- dard Ruby library, and I do not want to take you through the steps of gem installation for this example, so we’ll make do without these neat markup libraries. We’ll just assume that empty lines delimit paragraphs and that triple percent signs  %%%  are to be interpreted as explicit line breaks  which will become   tags followed by a line break .  So, let’s copy over our original example, with only one simple in-place editor. We’ll need three actions: one to serve the full page, one to serve the source markup for the editable element, and one to save it and return the XHTML equivalent. The resulting server script is as follows:  Download scriptaculous ipe alternate server.rb  Line 1  !  usr bin env ruby  require 'cgi' require 'erb' require 'webrick' include WEBrick  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  template_text = File.read 'index.rhtml'  template = ERB.new template_text   3. Beware of the difference of targets between loadingClassName, which applies to the whole editing form, and savingClassName, which applies only to your original element whose content is, at this point, only the saving message.   EDITING ALTERNATIVE TEXT  366  15  25  30  35  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  server = HTTPServer.new :Port => 8042  server.mount ' ', HTTPServlet::FileHandler, '.'   source = 'Some basic text'  def xhtml_convert text   ' ' + text.gsub   ?:\r\n {2,} , " \n " .gsub '%%%', " \n"  + ' '  20  end  server.mount_proc ' home'  do request, response  response['Content-Type'] = 'text html' xhtmlVersion = xhtml_convert source  response.body = template.result binding   end  end  end  server.mount_proc ' source'  do request, response  sleep 2  Darn we're slow... response['Content-Type'] = 'text plain' response.body = source  server.mount_proc ' update'  do request, response  sleep 2  Darn we're slow... source = request.query['value'] response.body = xhtml_convert source   40  trap 'INT'  { server.shutdown }  server.start  Note how we simulate loading and saving times, so you can easily see these steps in the browser. The tiny xhtml_convert    method starting on line 16 implements our small conversion algorithm.  The CSS will also change to use some styling for the loading and saving messages:  Download scriptaculous ipe alternate demo.css  h1 { font-size: 1.5em; }  .inplaceeditor-loading { background: ddd; color: gray; }  .inplaceeditor-saving {  height: 16px; padding-left: 20px; background: url  spinner.gif  no-repeat left center; font: italic smaller 16px sans-serif; color: gray;  }   DISABLING IN-PLACE EDITING  367  Figure 18.4: Using alternate text  Finally, we’ll adjust the script so it relies on alternate text:  Download scriptaculous ipe alternate demo.js  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  new Ajax.InPlaceEditor 'freeZone', ' update', {  loadingText: 'Fetching source text...', savingText: 'Saving and getting markup...', loadTextURL: ' source'  } ;  } ;  Now let’s kill any running server, launch this one, and reload our page  with a healthy cache bypass . Figure 18.4 shows a montage of the various stages for the ﬁrst edition.  The stages are represented from left to right and from top to bottom. Note that because we now have line breaks in the ﬁnal content, next time we edit we’ll end up using a multiple-line editor. And because we did not specify an explicit rows option, we’ll get the default 3, as explained earlier. Figure 18.5, on the following page shows the stages of a second editing attempt, with line breaks in the original content.  18.7 Disabling In-Place Editing  As usual, script.aculo.us provides you with the means to stop using a feature over an element. In this case, you can strip in-place editing   OFFERING A LIST OF VALUES INSTEAD OF TEXT TYPING  368  Figure 18.5: Editing content with line breaks  capabilities from an element by simply calling the destroy    method on the Ajax.InPlaceEditor object:  ipe.destroy    The former name for this method, dispose   , is still available as an alias but is deprecated.  18.8 Offering a List of Values Instead of Text Typing  There are situations where we’d like to let our users change an ele- ment’s content, but they should select among a series of possibilities. These choices would be presented as a single-selection drop-down list, based on a   tag.  To let you do this easily, script.aculo.us comes with a special subclass of Ajax.InPlaceEditor, called Ajax.InPlaceCollectionEditor. It builds exactly the same way:  new Ajax.InPlaceCollectionEditor element, savingURL [, options]   It’s otherwise used in an identical manner as Ajax.InPlaceEditor, except you get a few more options:   OFFERING A LIST OF VALUES INSTEAD OF TEXT TYPING  369  collection  A list of options to pick from. This means you’re statically deﬁning these options in the script  perhaps you’re generating the script dynamically, but mostly you won’t . This has to be an array, or something convertible through an array  as deﬁned in Section 3.5, $A, the Collection Uniﬁer, on page 47 .  The array can contain simple values, which will be used as both the   tag’s value= attribute and its textual content, or two- item arrays, where the ﬁrst item is the value= attribute and the second item is the textual content. We’ll see examples in a minute.  loadCollectionURL  In many cases you’ll either have a static, client-side list deﬁnition  through the collection option  or fetch it dynamically from the server. You can do this with loadCollectionURL, which points to a URL that will be called with the usual automatic editorId parame- ter and must return a JavaScript array that ﬁts the description for the collection option. This array will then be evaluated and used as if it had been passed directly.  loadCollectionText  The text to be shown in the pending drop-down while the list of choices is being fetched. This is similar to the role of loadingText for loadTextURL. This defaults to Loading choices....  The former value option was deprecated, because it basically makes no sense. Either the content  alternate or direct, depending on your set- tings  matches one of the option values, and that option will be selected; or there is no match, and the ﬁrst option will be selected.  Let’s look at a simple example, which fetches its list of options dynam- ically from the server. The styling is as minimalistic as ever:  Download scriptaculous ipe collection demo.css  h1 { font-size: 1.5em; }  The scripting is also very brief:  Download scriptaculous ipe collection demo.js  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  new Ajax.InPlaceCollectionEditor 'name', ' update', {  loadCollectionURL: ' names'  } ;  } ;   OFFERING A LIST OF VALUES INSTEAD OF TEXT TYPING  370  Now, our server must provide the  names action for the choice list, which is expressed like the collection option, as a JavaScript array. We’ll artiﬁcially delay the loading of options and the saving of the edited content so as to be able to see these steps.  Download scriptaculous ipe collection server.rb  !  usr bin env ruby  require 'cgi' require 'erb' require 'webrick' include WEBrick  template_text = File.read 'index.rhtml'  template = ERB.new template_text   server = HTTPServer.new :Port => 8042  server.mount ' ', HTTPServlet::FileHandler, '.'   options = %w Seth Corinne Lauren  content = options[0]  server.mount_proc ' home'  do request, response  response['Content-Type'] = 'text html' response.body = template.result binding   end  end  end  server.mount_proc ' names'  do request, response  sleep 1  Simulate slow option fetching... response['Content-Type'] = 'text plain'  No need for auto JS eval... response.body = '[' + options.map { s s.inspect   }.join ', '  + ']'  server.mount_proc ' update'  do request, response  sleep 1  Simulate slow option saving... content = request.query['value'] response.body = content  trap 'INT'  { server.shutdown }  server.start  Firing up this new server and refreshing our browser on http:  localhost:8042 home  bypassing the cache, as always , we can now use list-assisted content choice, as demonstrated by the montage in Figure 18.6, on the following page.   OFFERING A LIST OF VALUES INSTEAD OF TEXT TYPING  371  Figure 18.6: Editing with a choice list  This class was massively overhauled in the recent refactoring, because the former implementation suffered from quite a number of issues. The API has changed a bit, especially regarding option names, the process- ing of alternate content, and the dynamic fetching of the option list  something that was simply not possible before .  Well, that’s about it for in-place editing. If you used it in the past, do remember that it got through a complete rewrite for script.aculo.us 1.8, and the API changed a bit. Ajax.InPlaceCollectionEditor, in particular, became much more usable, and latent holes were plugged, making the whole thing more robust.  What We Just Learned  Despite the numerous features and possible tweaks, in-place editing is not a very complex subject. It boils down to these key points:    In-place editing is mostly about the Ajax.InPlaceEditor class. There is also a dropbox-based, predeﬁned-values variant using Ajax. InPlaceCollectionEditor.    Both were rewritten in 2007 to clean up their code base and add functionality. This rewrite changed parts of the API, especially the options.   OFFERING A LIST OF VALUES INSTEAD OF TEXT TYPING  372    Editing mode is triggered by clicking, either on the editable zone  itself  by default  or on a speciﬁed external control.    We can use an alternate text representation, fetched through Ajax and reprocessed by the server when saving, to spare the user the need to understand HTML.    Options provide ﬁne control over every detail of the appearance.    The Ajax requests sent to the server are highly customizable via many options and callbacks. An extra editorId parameter is always added in case the server code for several editors can be made generic.  Neuron Workout    What set of options would let us implement “unobtrusive in-place editing,” where clicking, say, titles would make them editable with no visual clutter and just clicking outside it or pressing the Return key would save to the server and revert to noneditable mode?    Let’s consider the following scenario:  – We have a site with a home page that features one of the articles among those we have stored away in the News section.  – We’re viewing the home page in “design mode,” which lets us click a small Edit link or icon next to the featured article’s title.  – When that control is clicked, the current article is replaced by  a drop-down list of the available article titles.  – We pick a title, we click a OK button or something, and the  newly selected article comes in.  How would we go about using our in-place editing capabilities to achieve this?   Chapter 19 Sliders  Sliders are thin tracks with one or more handles on them that the user can drag along the track. The goal of a slider is to provide an alternative input method for deﬁning a numerical value; the slider represents a range, and sliding a handle along the track deﬁnes a value within this range.  Figure 19.1 provides an overview of what sliders can look like, with a rather simple look. Internally, they are implemented by   and   elements that we deﬁne, so the styling is entirely up to us. It will easily ﬁt whatever design our page already uses.  Figure 19.1: A variety of possible sliders   CREATING A SIMPLE SLIDER  374  We’ll need the slider.js module, which contains the Control.Slider class. There is no dependency on other script.aculo.us modules. So, our script.aculo.us loading will look, at minimum, like this:      19.1 Creating a Simple Slider  Let’s start with a slider somewhere that lets the user deﬁne a numerical value within a given range.  Creating a slider is, as usual, a matter of constructing a custom object over a few existing elements in your page’s DOM. You’ll need two ele- ments here: one for the handle and one for the track.  new Control.Slider handle, track [, options]   The track element is usually a  , and the handle element is a   or   within the track element. Both can be passed either by their id= or by direct DOM references, as usual.  Let’s imagine the following XHTML fragment:            Creating a basic, all-defaults slider would simply require this:  new Control.Slider 'handle1', 'track1' ;  To try this, we’ll create a simple demonstration that will let us experi- ment with the orientation of the slider  its axis, horizontal or vertical , the deﬁnition of a preset value, and range customization.  Our “test bench,” index.html, will look like this:  Download scriptaculous slider simple index.html  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">         Simple sliders                    CREATING A SIMPLE SLIDER  375   Simple sliders                          <div id="track2" class="track vertical"  style="position: absolute; left: 25em; top: 3em;">      Notice we’ll need to bring in prototype.js, scriptaculous.js  unless you pre- fer loading individual script.aculo.us modules individually, as we could very well do here , and slider.js.  You can also see we put two   elements, which will provide us with feedback on the operation of the sliders, and indeed we put two sliders in there, one horizontal and one vertical.  We’ll also deﬁne a rather all-purpose style sheet for our sliders, which will use font-size-based dimensions, letting our UI adjust to the user’s zooming in or out:  Download scriptaculous slider simple demo.css  h1 { font-size: 1.5em; }  .track {  background-color: aaa; position: relative; height: 0.5em; width: 10em; cursor: pointer; z-index: 0;  } .handle {  background-color: red; position: absolute; height: 1em; width: 0.25em; top: -0.25em; cursor: move; z-index: 2;  } .track.vertical { width: 0.5em; height: 10em; } .track.vertical .handle {  width: 1em; height: 0.25em; top: 0; left: -0.25em; }  These styles are fairly reusable. Notice how we offset the handles slightly in the proper direction  using either left or top  so that they appear “centered” on the track, not tacked to one side of it.   CUSTOMIZING THE BASICS  376  Figure 19.2: Initial state of our simple sliders  19.2 Customizing the Basics  We’ll start playing with two options that let us change the slider’s ori- entation and its initial value:  axis  sliderValue  This lets us deﬁne whether the slider is horizontal  default  or ver- tical. This setting constrains the dragging movement of the handle on the proper axis.  This determines the initial position of the handle, which defaults to the beginning of the range. This range defaults to [0;1], mean- ing we start at zero. Our vertical slider will start in the middle, therefore at 0.5.  So here’s our current slider creation code:  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   { new Control.Slider 'handle1', 'track1' ; new Control.Slider 'handle2', 'track2', {  axis: 'vertical', sliderValue: 0.5 } ;  } ;  Figure 19.2, shows the initial state of our sliders. Go ahead, drag the handles! Don’t forget to release the dragging within the document, lest it   CUSTOMIZING THE BASICS  377  not be detected and, when you’d hover the mouse again, keep dragging your handle  this won’t happen in all browsers but still is an issue . Now, when we’re dragging handles around, we’d like to know which position that is; after all, we generally use sliders as an alternate input method for numerical values. It’s only fair that our users know which value they’re setting. This can be done with the two available callbacks:  onSlide  onChange  Triggered whenever the handle is moved  Triggered when the mouse button is ﬁnally released, ending the dragging of the handle  Both callbacks take two arguments: the value of the slider  expressed as a value within the range, so by default it will be between zero and one  and the slider object itself  the Control.Slider instance, not the track or handle element .  Do note that you can access such properties of the slider object as track and handle, which refer to the extended DOM elements for these two parts of the UI.  To demonstrate callbacks at work, we’ll deﬁne two simple functions that update each of our two feedback paragraphs, and then we’ll use these callbacks in our two sliders. To avoid deﬁning these functions twice, we’ll put them in a local object and reuse them in our Control.Slider deﬁnitions. Here’s the new script:  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  var callbacks = {  onSlide: function value, slider  {  $ 'sliding' .update slider.track.id + ' sliding to ' +  value.toFixed 3  ;  }, onChange: function value, slider  {  value.toFixed 3  ;  }  $ 'changed' .update slider.track.id + '\'s value changed to ' +  }; new Control.Slider 'handle1', 'track1', {  onSlide: callbacks.onSlide, onChange: callbacks.onChange  } ; new Control.Slider 'handle2', 'track2', {  axis: 'vertical', sliderValue: 0.5, onSlide: callbacks.onSlide, onChange: callbacks.onChange  } ;  } ;   RESTRICTING RANGE OR ALLOWED VALUES  378  Figure 19.3: Feedback messages thanks to callbacks  Notice how we can access slider.track.id from our callback to differentiate the messages depending on which slider was manipulated.  Reload the page and start sliding around. It should look something like Figure 19.3. You may wonder how it is that on this snapshot, the second message refers to track2 but the ﬁrst one still refers to track1. Isn’t sliding supposed to happen before ﬁnally setting a value? Well, not quite. You see, sliders let you click directly on the track to bring the handle right where you clicked. It’s a convenient trick. In such a case, the handle was not dragged and there was no sliding, but the value was changed.  19.3 Restricting Range or Allowed Values  Most of the time, you’ll probably need to work on a different range that holds some business meaning in the context of your page. Perhaps it’s a percentage and should go from 0 to 100. Perhaps it’s a minimum age, which should start around 3 and not exceed 21. Whatever the reason, you may need to customize the range, which is done with the range option.  range  Expressed as an ObjectRange object  the result of a $R    call , deﬁnes the range of acceptable values from one end of the slider to the other. This defaults to $R 0, 1 .   RESTRICTING RANGE OR ALLOWED VALUES  379  Figure 19.4: A custom range on our ﬁrst slider  Let’s adjust our script so that the ﬁrst slider  the horizontal one  works on a range from 3 to 21, for instance:  Download scriptaculous slider simple demo.js  new Control.Slider 'handle1', 'track1', {  range: $R 3, 21 , onSlide: callbacks.onSlide, onChange: callbacks.onChange  } ;  Reload and play with this ﬁrst slider. The boundaries should be clearly expressed in the feedback paragraphs, as shown in the montage in Figure 19.4.  That’s it for the ranges, but this doesn’t always cut it. Sometimes you need to allow only a discrete series of values, not a quasilinear progres- sion from one boundary to the other.  Say you’re dealing with integers only, perhaps for the difﬁculty level of an online game, or the zoom factor of an image viewer, or the amount of tiles to a side you want for a map display. Letting the user free-range between boundary values won’t do. You need speciﬁc values only! This is done with the values option:  values  An Enumerable of allowed values, which is ignored if false-equiva- lent  and it does default to false    RESTRICTING RANGE OR ALLOWED VALUES  380  Warning: Always Sync range with values!  At the time of this writing, the computing of handle positions is entirely based on the range option. When using values, if you leave range to its default  zero to one , your handles may very well appear way off the track.  Conversely, if you use a range larger than the extreme values you’re allowing, portions of the track won’t be accessible to your handles.  So when using values, I recommend you make sure range uses the two extreme values. For instance:  new Control.Slider 'handle1', 'track1', {  range: $R 3, 10 , values: $R 3, 10     other options here...  } ;  So, let’s say we want to use a slider to let our users choose an integer from 3 to 10, inclusive. We could do this with the following call:  new Control.Slider 'handle1', 'track1', {  values: $R 3, 10 , range: $R 3, 10   } ;  Keep in mind the difference between these options’ behaviors: values uses the range’s enumerated values, which will be apart from each other by exactly one  as Numbersucc    uses an increment of one , and only these values will be allowed. On the other hand, range cares only about the minimum and maximum values, which Control.Slider uses to compute handle positions over the track.  When values is deﬁned, sliding the handles will “stick” to the nearest allowed positions as you’re dragging.  Of course, you don’t have to use a regular series of values. It can be much more. . . personal:  new Control.Slider 'handle1', 'track1', { values: [1, 5, 38, 46] } ;  Still, this may be a bit unwieldy for the user. It’s better then to use a regular series and map the raw values to those you need by using, for instance, one-to-one mapping between both arrays.   TWEAKING AN EXISTING SLIDER AND ADDING CONTROLS  381  19.4 Tweaking an Existing Slider and Adding Controls  There are a few things you can do to a slider once it’s up and running. For instance, you can disable it and enable it later  which is useful when you use it as part of a form, because it won’t be disabled auto- matically by Formdisable   , for instance . The methods for this are sim- ply setEnabled    and setDisabled   . You can check whether it’s disabled by looking at the value for its disabled property.  You can also programmatically change the value of a slider by using set- Value value . If you need to specify a delta instead of an actually value, use setValueBy delta . This lets you easily implement external controls, such as arrow links or buttons. You’ll ﬁnd an example of this in script.- aculo.us’s sliders functional test in test functional slider_test.html.  Finally, as always with script.aculo.us controls, you can take back their features by destroying the control object. The method for this here is dispose   .  19.5 Deﬁning Multiple Values  A great feature of sliders lets you use multiple handles on a single track, which allows your users to deﬁne multiple values on a single slider.  The trick is to provide an alternative syntax for the sliderValue and han- dle options. They can take arrays, too. Each handle will be preset to the original value that matches it, on a one-to-one basis, in sliderValue.  The value-setting methods, setValue and setValueBy, also take an optio- nal second argument that is the index  starting at zero  of the handle whose value is being assigned. Instead of the single value property, you would use the values property, an array indexed in the same order as the handles.  Your slider control maintains two properties for this: activeHandle and activeHandleIdx. The latest used handle  be it by clicking, dragging, or programmatic value setting  is the only one featuring a selected CSS class, which lets you set it visually apart.  Finally, note that you can prevent handles from crossing each other  when dragging, you could prevent a handle from moving across an- other one . This is enabled with the restricted option, which you just need to set to true.   DEFINING MULTIPLE VALUES  382  Figure 19.5: Multiple handles and values  Here’s an example XHTML fragment:  Download scriptaculous slider multiple index.html        <div id="handle2" class="handle"  style="width: 0.5em; background: blue;">   <div id="handle3" class="handle"  style="width: 0.5em; background: green;">      And here’s the corresponding construction call:  Download scriptaculous slider multiple demo.js  new Control.Slider ['handle1', 'handle2', 'handle3'],  'track1', { range: $R 1, 11 , values: $R 1, 11 , sliderValue: [3, 6, 9], onSlide: callbacks.onSlide, onChange: callbacks.onChange  } ;  In code scriptaculous slider multiple, the source code archive contains an example page that is visible, after a couple clicks and drags, in Fig- ure 19.5. You’ll ﬁnd more examples in script.aculo.us’s sliders func- tional test page, located in the archive at test functional slider_test.html.  There’s a last feature I’d like to mention, which lets you add a visual hint that you’re using sliders to deﬁne ranges  generally adjacent ones : spans. By styling these elements  usually   ones , you give a visual cue as to the ranges being deﬁned, instead of relying on the uniform color of the track.   DEFINING MULTIPLE VALUES  383  Advanced Sliders and Opera  When you get advanced with sliders, you may end up hav- ing minor visual quirks running on Opera. Opera is not, after all, ofﬁcially supported yet, and although just about every code in this book runs just ﬁne on it, sliders may get a bit quirky here and there.  By interleaving span elements with your handle elements  all of this within your track’s   , you can ask Control.Slider to adjust their positions and dimensions so they stick to surrounding handles. This is most often used in conjunction with “restricted” handle movement  in which handle order is preserved over time, because handles cannot be dragged across each other .  Three properties are involved here:  spans  An array of elements  or their id= values, as always , usually  s, in ascending range order  that is, the ﬁrst   is between the ﬁrst and second handle, the second   lies be- tween the second and third handle, and so on . This defaults to false, which disables the feature.  Optional initial range, appearing between the beginning of the track and the ﬁrst handle. This defaults to null.  startSpan  endSpan  Optional ﬁnal range, appearing between the last track and the end of the track. This defaults to null.  Here’s an example XHTML fragment:  Download scriptaculous slider spans index.html           <div id="handle2" class="handle"  style="width: 0.5em; background: blue;">      <div id="handle3" class="handle"  style="width: 0.5em; background: green;">       DEFINING MULTIPLE VALUES  384  Figure 19.6: Multiple handles and spans  And here’s the corresponding construction call:  Download scriptaculous slider spans demo.js  new Control.Slider ['handle1', 'handle2', 'handle3'],  'track1', { range: $R 1, 11 , values: $R 1, 11 , sliderValue: [3, 6, 9], spans: ['range1', 'range2'], restricted: true, onSlide: callbacks.onSlide, onChange: callbacks.onChange  } ;  This will require an extra dollop of CSS:  Download scriptaculous slider spans demo.css  .handle.selected { outline: 2px solid black; z-index: 3; } .track .range {  position: absolute; height: 0.5em; width: 0.5em; z-index: 1; }  See code scriptaculous slider spans for an example page; playing with it can yield something like Figure 19.6. You’ll ﬁnd more examples, yet again, in script.aculo.us’s sliders functional test page.  Neuron Workout  How about a pop quiz?    We’re building a shopping site for home appliances  for example, fridges, ovens, and washing machines  for a client. She tells us she would like to offer users the possibility of quickly specifying   DEFINING MULTIPLE VALUES  385  a minimum and maximum price they’re willing to pay as an extra criterion in the form they’re using to sift through the catalog. How could we use a single slider to implement this? Think about the details of price feedback  showing the range being created  and integrating with the form that’s going to be sent to the server.    Say we have a thumbnail gallery of photographs. How could we  use a slider to dynamically set thumbnail size?    Create a small function that, given a hash of  value × label  pairs, creates a ﬁxed-size slider that uses only those values and displays the matching label in an associated element as the user moves the handle along.   Chapter 20 Sound Without Flash  Version 1.7 of script.aculo.us introduced a new tiny module that lets you play sounds in your web pages without having to resort to an embedded, Flash-based player. The upshot is, well, you don’t need Flash. That means you do not need to load a Flash sound-playing object in addition to your sound ﬁle s . The potential issue, however, is that this module assumes your browser can natively process the sound ﬁle  for example, a MP3 ﬁle .  20.1 Where Does It Work?  This module works wherever your browser has native  or plug-in-based  support for the sound ﬁles you’re using, which are assumed to be based on the MPEG audio layer  the most common variant nowadays being MP3 . This essentially means the following situations:    On OS X, you’re good to go. Every browser on OS X beneﬁts from  the platform’s QuickTime support for sound ﬁles. It Just Works.    On Windows, it works natively on Internet Explorer; otherwise, you usually need the QuickTime plug-in installed; it has pretty good market penetration  especially since, recently, it has been bundled with Windows versions of iTunes and Safari , although it’s perhaps not quite as ubiquitous as Flash.    On Linux, as always, it all depends on which packages were in- stalled by the system’s administrator. But then, it’s as true for QuickTime as it is for Flash, and all major distributions have packages for both.   20.2 How Do We Play Sounds?  HOW DO WE PLAY SOUNDS?  387  First, you need to load the sound module, just like you would load any other script.aculo.us module, for instance, using the loader system:      Then, all you need to do in your code is something as simple as this:  Sound.play 'sounds myeffect.mp3' ;  That’s it! This alone plays your sound now  the module does not support looping . As you might expect, there can be a bit more to it, though. The full syntax goes like this:  Sound.disable   Sound.enable   Sound.play url [, options]   The disable    and enable    methods globally toggle whether play    calls are actually processed. They do not impact previously made calls; any ongoing sound keeps going. They impact only future calls to play   . They’re the obvious way to implement a user-togglable Mute feature.  The core method is, expectedly, play   . At the minimum, you provide the URL of your sound ﬁle. The module will assume your ﬁle format is related to MPEG audio, so you should use MP3, for instance. The options parameter is a hash of options, as usual, and Sound supports two of those: track and replace. We’ll explore them now.  20.3 Playing Multiple Sounds on Multiple Tracks  The sound module lets you play multiple sounds in parallel and group them as tracks. Whenever you ask for a new sound to play, you can put it into a speciﬁc group  or track , and either add it to the currently playing sounds of that track or make it replace the whole track.  The track Option By default, sounds are added to the default track, named global. They also add to the track, which means they do not replace the currently running sounds. They start playing over whatever sound is currently playing.  To specify sound groups, use the track option. You can use whatever names you want for the tracks, as long as you observe XHTML’s id= syntax requirements. This is because your track name will become   PLAYING MULTIPLE SOUNDS ON MULTIPLE TRACKS  388  part of the id= for the DOM element responsible for playing the sound. You would likely use such names as effects, notiﬁcations, music, or ambience.  Note that, currently, grouping sounds in tracks is useful only when you need to replace them with another sound, as described in the next section.  The replace Option Sometimes you may want a new sound to replace any currently run- ning sound in its track. Perhaps you’re signaling the end of a process and that process was made “audible” through the use of a little tune or something; or perhaps you have “ambient” sounds that reﬂect the cur- rent visual theme or universe, and the user just switched to another theme, which you need to reﬂect not only visually but also audibly. In this case, you can use the replace option and set it to true  it defaults to false . All currently running sounds in the track will then be stopped, and your new sound will start.  In the source code archive for this book, you will ﬁnd a few free sound effect ﬁles in the code scriptaculous sound directory:  effect_crowd_....mp3  ambience_....mp3  Crowd sound effects: applause, excitement, and three laughs  Ambient sounds: an outdoor café, a simple tune, rain falling and surf crashing on the shore  Let’s quickly put together a simple demo that’ll let us play any ambience sound one at a time and layer as many sound effects as we need on top of that. Create a directory for the demo, and then whip up the following HTML ﬁle:  Download scriptaculous sound index.html  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN" "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd">         Sounding out                  PLAYING MULTIPLE SOUNDS ON MULTIPLE TRACKS  389   Sounding out with script.aculo.us    Sound effects        Applause     Excitement     Laugh 1     Laugh 2     Laugh 3        Ambience        Outdoor café     A simple tune     Rainfall     Surf crashing on the  shore           }  }  } ;  Don’t forget to put prototype.js and sound.js in there, too. Finally, we’ll put the script together. It’s very simple indeed:  Download scriptaculous sound demo.js  function playAmbience e  {  e.stop  ; Sound.play e.findElement 'a' .href, { track: 'ambience',  replace: true } ;  function playEffect e  {  e.stop  ; Sound.play e.findElement 'a' .href, { track: 'effects' } ;  document.observe 'dom:loaded', function   {  $ 'effects' .select 'a' .invoke 'observe', 'click', playEffect ; $ 'ambience' .select 'a' .invoke 'observe', 'click', playAmbience ;  Technically, we could have left the ambience sounds on the default, global track, but it’s always best to put special-purpose sounds in their own track so we can manipulate them separately.   PLAYING MULTIPLE SOUNDS ON MULTIPLE TRACKS  390  OK, now start by clicking an ambience sound, say, the simple tune  it stands out better than the other ambience sounds once we start layer- ing effects over it . Then start clicking a short effect, perhaps the ﬁrst laugh. When it’s done, try a longer one  for example, the applause , and start heavy-clicking to layer multiple effects. Once we’re all sounded up, change the ambience. Because we speciﬁed replace: true, the tune stops and gets replaced by the new ambience.  And that’s all there is to the sound module for now. It’s really simple, as you can plainly see from our script. But it sure can help to comple- ment your UI with appropriate, well-used audio feedback  think chat windows, event dashboards, and the like . Be careful not to clutter the audio space with too much sound, though. . . .   Appendix A Extending and Contributing  It doesn’t take long before you end up with complicated scripts pro- viding complex functionality. You might very well need to complement Prototype’s features with your own, either in separate objects or by extending existing ones. In this appendix, you’ll see how to extend Pro- totype objects and how to contribute back.  A.1 Building Over: Classes, Inheritance, and DOM Extension  First you need to understand the object system in Prototype. As you may know, JavaScript is not a class-based language, with the usual class object dichotomy and the usual class inheritance reﬂexes and habits. No. JavaScript is a prototype-based language.  Getting into the details of how this actually works would be way beyond the scope of this chapter, or even this book. You’ll ﬁnd excellent arti- cles about prototypes and other JavaScript OO issues  such as how to encode public, private, and “privileged” methods, as well as “static” members  on the websites of several JavaScript gurus, such as Douglas Crockford and Dean Edwards:    http:  javascript.crockford.com prototypal.html    http:  javascript.crockford.com private.html    http:  www.litotes.demon.co.uk js_info private_static.html    http:  dean.edwards.name base   However, we can simulate the traditional OO concepts, such as the class object dichotomy, inheritance, mixins, and so on, using regular JavaScript and a healthy dose of syntactic sugar provided by Prototype.   BUILDING OVER: CLASSES, INHERITANCE, AND DOM EXTENSION  392  What “Classes” Actually Are in JavaScript The main point to remember is that there are no classes per se, only objects. Every object is created based on a constructor function  which most people call a class so as not to lose their sanity too quickly . Func- tions are objects, too  like numbers and regular expressions, by the way . Every object has a prototype, which deﬁnes properties  includ- ing methods  shared by all instances of this object—yes, I actually said “instances of this object.” Get a grip.  So when you’re deﬁning methods in a constructor function’s prototype, for instance, you’re deﬁning methods for all the instances obtained by using the new operator on this function  for example, new String  or string literals  and new Array  or array literals . This is exactly what Pro- totype does to existing constructor functions to extend the capabilities of native JavaScript objects.  The reason I’m not diving more into the details is that Prototype does most of it its own way, which is much simpler and feels more like tradi- tional OO programming. It has been profoundly redesigned in version 1.6 and now features more convenient syntax and properly simulates inheritance and mixins.  Deﬁning a New Class The Prototype way of creating a class still relies on Class.create   , al- though the syntax has been enriched. The full syntax, which lets you deﬁne a superclass when you want to, is as follows: Class.create  [superclass] [, Module...]> [, { instanceMethod }]  → Class  Because all arguments are optional, you can indeed call it with no argu- ment, as you used to do in, say, Prototype 1.5. You would then add the instance methods later. However, why keep with the old, two-phase, kludgy way when we can now put the instance methods right in the call? Here’s an example class creation:  Download prototype classes creation.js  var Animal = Class.create {  initialize: function name  {  this.name = name;  }, eat: function food  {  return this.say 'Yum!' ;  }, say: function msg  {  return this.name + ': ' + msg;  } } ;   BUILDING OVER: CLASSES, INHERITANCE, AND DOM EXTENSION  393  Class Mechanism: 1.6 Changed Everything!  If you had already created your own classes in versions of Prototype prior to 1.6, your code should still work in this new version. However, to fully leverage the new capabilities  such as inheritance , you’ll need to migrate your code to the new, extended syntaxes. The former dichotomy  Class.create      Object.extend     is not the way to go anymore.  The following pattern:  var Loader = Class.create  ; Object.extend Loader.prototype, {  initialize: ..., otherInstanceMethod: ...  } ; Object.extend Loader, {  staticMethod1: ..., staticMethod2: ...  } ;  } ;  var Loader = Class.create {  initialize: ..., otherInstanceMethod: ...  } ; Object.extend Loader, {  staticMethod1: ..., staticMethod2: ...  . . . would still work but should now read as follows:  Note that the initialize    method is not mandatory anymore. If you don’t have construction-time behavior in your class, you can now skip it  it will be stubbed out by Prototype.emptyFunction .  Our simple class can now be used in a straightforward manner:  Download prototype classes creation.js  var fido = new Animal 'Fido' ; fido.name    => 'Fido' fido.say 'Hi'     => 'Fido: Hi' fido.eat 'bone' ;    => 'Fido: Yum!'   BUILDING OVER: CLASSES, INHERITANCE, AND DOM EXTENSION  394  Modules are also sets of instance methods, so you can specify modules to mix in, not just a literal set of custom methods for your class:  var Dequeue = Class.create Enumerable, {     dequeue methods  Naturally, you can combine both a parent class and modules:  var ChildClass = Class.create ParentClass, Enumerable, MyCoolModule, {     child's instance methods  Inheriting from Another Class This was a sore point of the former versions. “Traditional” inheritance in JavaScript is implemented in a rather disturbing fashion—by reas- signing the prototype of the constructor function for the subclass. This can quickly lead to headaches for the nonexpert, so Prototype hides all this complexity from you. When you want to deﬁne a class as a subclass of another one, you simply pass the superclass as the ﬁrst argument to Class.create   , before the mixins and set of instance methods.  Let’s look at an example:  Download prototype classes extend.js  var Cat = Class.create Animal, {  eat: function $super, food  {  if  food instanceof Mouse  return $super food ; return this.say 'Yuck! I only eat mice.' ;  } ;  } ;  } } ;  var Mouse = Class.create Animal ;    Dumb subclass  And that’s all there is to it! Note how we didn’t even need to declare initialize    this time. We automatically inherit it from Animal, and because we do not need to augment the inherited behavior for it, we don’t need to override it.  Overriding a Method and Calling the Inherited One  I’m sure you noticed the $super ﬁrst parameter to eat   . This is a speciﬁc name that Prototype detects. When you prepend your method’s signa- ture with it, you’ll get passed the inherited version of the method as argument, which you can then call when you need it. If you don’t need to invoke the inherited version, just don’t declare this ﬁrst argument.   BUILDING OVER: CLASSES, INHERITANCE, AND DOM EXTENSION  395  Here’s an example use:  Download prototype classes extend.js  var fido = new Animal 'Fido' ; var tom = new Cat 'Tom' ; var jerry = new Mouse 'Jerry' ; tom.say 'Hi'     => 'Tom: Hi' jerry.eat 'cheese'     => 'Jerry: Yum!' tom.eat fido     => 'Tom: Yuck! tom.eat 'bone'     => 'Tom: Yuck! tom.eat jerry     => 'Tom: Yum!'  I only eat mice.'  I only eat mice.'  Isn’t life beautiful now? As a ﬁnal note on inheritance, I’d like to give due credit, on behalf of the Prototype Core team, to those whose work and research inspired the API and implementation; prominently, we beneﬁted from the excellent works by Dean Edwards and Alex Arnell. As for Core, this new goodness is mostly the work of Mislav and Andrew, with Sam shooting them a withering glare whenever their suggested names and syntaxes were too outlandish.  Adding More Instance Properties and Methods klass.addMethods { instanceMethod  }  → klass  Once a class is created, it is possible to add more instance properties  including methods  to it using its addMethods    class method. Here’s an example:  Download prototype classes extend.js  Cat.addMethods {  } ; tom.purr  ;    => 'Tom: Rrrrrr...'  purr: function   { return this.say 'Rrrrrr...' ; }  Incidentally, this lets you mix modules in, too, because modules are just sets of instance methods  and possibly other properties . Still, you’ll generally mix modules in at creation time.   BUILDING OVER: CLASSES, INHERITANCE, AND DOM EXTENSION  396  Adding Static Properties and Methods Object.extend klass, { staticMethod  }  → klass  Adding static properties  and thus methods  to a class is just one case of adding properties to an object  remember that in JavaScript, classes are functions, and functions are objects , so we can use the regular Object.extend    mechanism.  You could use it like this, for instance:  Download prototype classes extend.js  var Animal = Class.create {  initialize: function name  {  Animal.newInstance  ;  this.name = name;  }, eat: function food  {  return this.say 'Yum!' ;  }, say: function msg  {  return this.name + ': ' + msg;  } } ;  } ;  Object.extend Animal, {  instanceCount: 0, newInstance: function   { ++this.instanceCount; }  It is likely that Prototype 1.6.1 will provide a more integrated mecha- nism for specifying class methods and properties, though, especially at creation time.  Automatic Class Properties Prototype maintains three properties for you that open the door to pow- erful introspection:  obj.constructor → Class class.superclass → Class class.subclasses → [ Class, ... ]  Theoretically, every object has a native constructor property that refers to its constructor function, which basically means its class. However, there are a few issues across browsers with this property, so Prototype overwrites it to guarantee its value is correct.   BUILDING OVER: CLASSES, INHERITANCE, AND DOM EXTENSION  397  Prototype also adds two new properties. First, every class features a superclass property, which refers to its parent class  or null if there is no parent class, which means the class was created with no parent class ﬁrst argument passed to Class.create    .  Second, every class also features a subclasses property, which is an array of references to the classes that extend the current class. This property is never null, much less undeﬁned. At worst, it’s an empty array. Whenever a class is created by extension of another, it registers itself in its parent’s subclasses property. Using these two properties, you can see it’s fairly easy to walk a class hierarchy.  Here’s a series of expressions based on our previous code:  Download prototype classes extend.js     => true tom.constructor == Cat tom.constructor.superclass == Animal    => true    => true Cat.superclass == Animal    => null Animal.superclass    => 2 Animal.subclasses.length Animal.subclasses.first   == Cat    => true    => true Animal.subclasses.last   == Mouse Cat.subclasses    => []  Extending DOM Elements If you want to equip DOM elements with even more methods than Proto- type already does, you need to work with Element.addMethods   . It lets you add methods to all elements or elements with speciﬁc tag names  say,   or   elements alone .  Element.addMethods  [tagNameOrNames,] methods   The ﬁrst, optional argument is a single tag name or an array of tag names. The mandatory argument is a hash-like object with the methods inside.  Each method you deﬁne must take the element as its ﬁrst argument. It does not have the guarantee that this will be bound to the element. The extension mechanism will let you invoke these methods without that ﬁrst argument, right on the extended elements. But you can also invoke them directly, passing an unextended element to them.  I advise you against directly hacking Prototype’s original method repos- itories  such as Element.Methods . Use your own repositories, and per- form the addMethods    call with it.   CONTRIBUTING!  398  Say you want to add a convenience pulsate    shortcut that would basi- cally be a preﬁlled call on script.aculo.us’s generic addition, visualEf- fect   . You’d go like this:  YourLib.Element.Methods = {  pulsate: function element, options  { return $ element .pulsate options ;  Element.addMethods YourLib.Element.Methods ;  That would be a generic extension. Now suppose you need to add a markAsRequired    method to form ﬁelds. It would be more like this:  YourLib.Field.Methods = {  markAsRequired: function element  {  element = $ element ; element.addClassName 'required' ; var lbl = $$ 'label[for="' + element.id + '"]' .reduce  ; if  lbl  lbl.addClassName 'required' ;  }  };  }  }  Element.addMethods $w 'input textarea select' , YourLib.Field.Methods ;  Do not confuse Element.addMethods    with the addMethods    facility you get on custom classes. They share the same name but are otherwise unrelated.  A.2 Contributing!  You’ll ﬁnd a quick rundown on the ofﬁcial site, written by our enthusi- ast Prototype Core member Mislav Marohni´c: http:  prototypejs.org contribute. This section has a lot in common with it but tries to get into slightly deeper detail now and then.  So, Prototype changed your life, uh? I know, I can relate.  Whenever you code with Prototype, a warm fuzzy feeling comes over you, and you think “Life is so much better now. Those guys rule. I wish I could give something back to the community.”  There you go.   CONTRIBUTING!  399  There are a lot of ways you can help and share your  however newly acquired  Prototype skills. Here are the main ones:    Subscribe to the support list,1 and start answering questions. Avoid guessing too wildly, but you don’t need to be absolutely authoritative either. If you miss a detail when replying, someone will likely chime in with a quick ﬁx.    Start browsing the Trac, which is where everybody ﬁles bug re- ports and enhancement requests. You can start with hunting down duplicate or invalid tickets. If you do notice as-yet unre- ported issues that you can easily reproduce, feel free to submit bug reports, too.    Learn to use the Subversion repository, so as to play with “Pro- totype Edge,” the latest state of the library. This is important in order to know what’s cooking and to help closing incoming tickets when they’re now ﬁxed, for instance.    Shift into third gear, and start writing patches! This will require mastering the unit test library that Prototype relies on, because patches need to come with a full complement of tests to be accep- ted. You’ll have to test on as many browsers as you can, too. But once your patches start making it in, you’ll likely ﬁnd it addictive  and contributor glory is at hand! .  Because Trac and Subversion are the two pivotal tools of contributing to Prototype, I’ll spend a few pages giving you as many useful pointers as I can about how we expect contributors to use them. This should help you contribute in the most efﬁcient  and appreciated  manner.  Staying on Top of Things: Trac Trac is a tracking system that lets people ﬁle bug reports and enhance- ment requests. It also has a lot of nice features, such as document sharing, reports  custom queries over the ticket database that can be saved and reused at will , and a wonderful integration with version con- trol systems such as Subversion.  Prototype shares a Trac  and a Subversion server, actually  with Ruby on Rails  remember that although backend-agnostic, Prototype and script.aculo.us are, originally, Rails spin-offs . The basic URL is http:  dev.rubyonrails.org.  1. http:  groups.google.com group rubyonrails-spinoffs   CONTRIBUTING!  400  Figure A.1: The Trac timeline  Anybody can browse tickets, do searches, and the like. However, only authenticated users can modify tickets  for example, add a comment, attach a ﬁle, close the ticket, reopen it  and create new ones. Getting a user account is simple enough. Use the Register link on the top-right corner of the Trac’s home page, and sign up. When you come to Trac later, don’t forget to log in ﬁrst  there’s a Login link in the same area .  Browsing the Trac  The Trac is mostly tickets, plus terse information about past and up- coming milestones. Those are Rails milestones, so they’re not directly related to Prototype.  You can see the latest ticket activity by looking at the timeline  http:  dev.rubyonrails.org timeline , which displays everything that happened in a given timeframe. By default, it lists just about everything  changes to tickets and milestones, Sub- version commits—called changesets  in the past seven days, but you can customize this thanks to a little pad on the right side, as displayed in Figure A.1.   CONTRIBUTING!  401  Figure A.2: A Trac ticket  You can also zero in on tickets that fall within a speciﬁc category. In Trac, categories are mostly represented by reports, which are prede- ﬁned search criteria. Our Trac features a bunch of such reports, acces- sible through the View Tickets link. For instance, report 22 contains all the pending patches for Prototype and script.aculo.us. They’re usu- ally in need of further review or complementary tests. That’s a great place to start helping.  A Trac ticket looks like Figure A.2. It features a summary, a descrip- tion, comments, attached ﬁles, and a whole bunch of properties. The most important ones are the Type  for example, defect or enhance- ment , the Component  which in our case will always be Prototype or script.aculo.us , and the Severity.  Searching the Trac  Sometimes you just need to ﬁnd speciﬁc tickets in the Trac. There are several ways to do that quickly:    If you’re looking for a speciﬁc ticket, you can just type its number, preceded by a hash sign   , in the top-right search box. That will   CONTRIBUTING!  402  take you right to it. Übergeeks actually use their browser history to bring up a recent ticket URL  something like http:  dev.rubyonrails.org ticket 7417  and replace the number in it so as to avoid having to load a Trac page before.    If you’re just looking to ﬁlter down on reports, just load the appro- priate report, either by ﬁrst going to their list page  the View Tick- ets link  or by playing it hard and using a direct URL, such as http:  dev.rubyonrails.org report 22.    Advanced searches with complex criteria will need to use the “Cus- tom query” feature, accessible through a link in the top-right corner of the report pages or directly at http:  dev.rubyonrails.org query. This lets you deﬁne custom ﬁlters on any ticket property.  Keeping Posted  A great thing about Trac is that most of its report-like pages have a related RSS feed. This is true not only for the timeline, reports, or even individual tickets but also for any custom query you could create!  Just look at the bottom of the page for a Download in other formats section. You can get several variants in there and always an RSS feed. By putting it in your favorite aggregator, you’re certain not to miss a thing!  A word of caution about this, though, when it comes to the Timeline feed. By default, it is conﬁgured to load a maximum of 50 items, going at most 90 days back. The URL you’ll get for it is simple enough to customize, in case you want it to be more  or less  comprehensive than the default settings.  Pragmatic Tickets  OK, so the next step is to contribute to the tickets. There are two things you can do here: ﬁle new stuff and help with the triage of existing stuff. Both are helpful, although maybe the second task is easier and perhaps a smooth way of warming up to using Trac.  Hunting Down Invalid Tickets and Duplicates A signiﬁcant part of the work over Prototype and script.aculo.us tickets in Trac is hunting down duplicate or invalid tickets. Helping with this is easy enough and very useful to Prototype Core. Common cases where tickets are invalid include the following:    The current stable version does not exhibit the reported issue.   CONTRIBUTING!  403    The ticket requests an enhancement that is far too user-speciﬁc  it does not look like it is generally useful and should be implemented in the library .    The ticket is obviously a spam of some kind.  Detecting duplicates is a bit harder, because it requires a good knowl- edge of the existing tickets, which means you spend time now and then keeping up-to-date on the open tickets and knowing enough of the code base that you can determine two issues are actually the same one. For instance, after Prototype 1.5.0 released, tickets started coming in hard about Ajax being broken and HashtoQueryString    not behaving prop- erly. The two issues were actually very much related. Duplicate hunting meant understanding this and closing all but the ﬁrst such report as duplicates.  A ﬁnal note about good manners: when you do close a ticket because you deem it a duplicate, be sure to add a comment that states which ticket it is a duplicate of!  Completing or Creating Tickets If you’re at all interested in contributing to Prototype and script.aculo.- us, this section is important. It deﬁnes what a good ticket is.  A good ticket should satisfy the following requirements  most of which are detailed later :    It’s not a duplicate, and it is valid against the current trunk.   Its summary is concise yet explicit and features the proper pre-  ﬁxes.    The description  and comments  uses proper markup, especially  for code fragments  either inline or blocks .    The key properties  Type, Component, Severity, and to a slightly  lesser degree Priority  are properly set.    It makes efﬁcient use of the normalized keywords.   It comes with a clean patch, made against the current trunk  or a  reasonably close version , provided as an attached ﬁle.    The patch includes all relevant unit tests  and possibly functional tests . The trunk fails these tests without the patch and passes them, on all supported browsers, with the patch applied.  I already talked about what duplicates were and what was a sure ﬂag for an invalid one.   CONTRIBUTING!  404  Now about the rest:  Summaries  A summary needs to be as expressive as possible. By “expressive,” I mean both concise and informational enough. For instance, “The Back button clears out autocompleter ﬁelds in Mozilla-based browsers” is pretty good, but “Ajax doesn’t work” is as lame as it gets.  Another very important part of summaries is the informal stan- dards in place for their preﬁxes. You should always preﬁx a ticket that comes with a patch using [PATCH]. If this patch comes with tests, you should add [TEST]. This helps triage a lot for Prototype Core.  Descriptions  Always use clear descriptions. Classic copy advice holds true— simple sentences, clear punctuation, and so on. Also make sure you use proper markup for code, be it inline  for example, variable or method names  or as a separate block  code samples . The trick is to wrap code between triple curly braces, like this:  The following code:  {{{ var obj = HumongousLib.dom.util.short.get 'someID' ; HumongousLib.effects.visual.simple.hide obj ; }}}  ...was OK, but I realized {{{$ 'someID' .hide  }}} just rules. Do you get a lot of switchers?  This makes it easier on the eyes of everybody.  If you’re reporting a bug or editing an existing bug report, be sure to include clear steps for reproducing it. You may have put up a minimalistic reproducible case online  aww, aren’t you great! , in which case the description is an ideal place to put a link to it. URLs get linked automatically. By the way, Trac’s automatic number formats get detected and linked. Most notably, you can use ticketId, [changeSetId], and {reportId}. Use the WikiFormat- ting link above the description zone for the full details of the avail- able syntax.   CONTRIBUTING!  405  Properties  Be sure to set all key properties with care. Type will usually be defect  bug report  or enhancement. Component will be either Pro- totype or script.aculo.us. Priority determines how urgent the ticket is, while Severity determines its impact  how bad the bug is and how deeply the enhancement impacts the code base .  Leave ﬁelds such as Milestone and Version alone; those are deci- sions by Those Who Commit To Trunk. Also refrain from manually assigning the ticket to someone in particular.  Keywords  Spin-offs teams have agreed on a series of normalized keywords to use in the Keywords ﬁeld that let them sort through incoming stuff. When a ticket requires only a tiny patch  for example, a trivial one-liner , use the keyword tiny. When the patch is well- tested and deemed ready  possibly after multiple revisions and a consensus in the comments  for application to the trunk, add the ready keyword.  Patches and tests  Whatever the ticket, good patches are paramount. To have a de- cent chance at being processed quickly, a ticket has to come with a clean patch and a full complement of tests. The art of producing such things is what we’ll discuss in the next section.  Edge Spin-offs: The Subversion Repository Prototype, script.aculo.us, and everything in the Rails universe use Subversion for version control  keeping track of all the history for all ﬁles in the source tree . You don’t need to be a Subversion guru to con- tribute code to Prototype and script.aculo.us, but you’ll need, at the very least, to be able to get Prototype Edge from it.  If you know CVS, you’ll be right at home with Subversion. The basic usage is identical. If you don’t know any of those, the website is http:  subversion.tigris.org, where you’ll ﬁnd, among other things, a link to the excellent Subver- sion book,2 available in many formats, including PDF and online HTML. Chapters 1 and 2 should get you up and running in no time.  2. http:  svnbook.red-bean.com    CONTRIBUTING!  406  Getting the Latest Source Code  Prototype and script.aculo.us live in a branch of Rails’ Subversion re- pository, located at http:  svn.rubyonrails.org rails spinoffs .  At the time of this writing, script.aculo.us has no branches, but Proto- type uses the classical trunk tags branches split:    The trunk is where the next version is being cooked up. It’s the  home of Prototype Edge.    Branches provide separate areas for Prototype Core members to tweak stuff. For instance, the selector branch is where Andrew Dupont and I play around when pushing Selector  and therefore $$     forward; event is the playground for new ideas being tossed around toward a full rewrite of the event management system; and so on. . .  .    Tags are frozen states of the trunk that represent speciﬁc versions. You’ll ﬁnd every released version of Prototype in there, from 1.5.0 onward.  To contribute, the only thing you really need to do is check out the trunk and later update it. To do this, you just need to grab a Subversion client program and point it to the URL of the trunk  or higher up the repository tree, perhaps all the way to spinoffs .  There are client programs for all tastes, from TortoiseSVN  which inte- grates with the Windows Explorer  to the classic command-line client. This is the one we are going to use in this chapter. Look at what is available for your speciﬁc platform at http:  subversion.tigris.org project_packages.html, and download and install it.  The ﬁrst time, you’ll need to check out the part of the repository you need. For instance, to check out the trunk, just open a command prompt, go to the directory you want to check it out to, and then simply type this:  trunk test trunk test unit trunk test unit range.html  $ svn co http:  svn.rubyonrails.org rails spinoffs prototype trunk  A A A ... A A A A Checked out revision 6390. $  trunk src ajax.js trunk src form.js trunk src hash.js trunk README   Of course, you’ll get a higher version number  it rises with every com- mit operation . You know have a trunk directory, which is bound to the Subversion repository. To update it to the latest version, you just need to get in there and type this:  CONTRIBUTING!  407  test unit selector.html Rakefile CHANGELOG src selector.js  $ svn up U U U U Updated to revision 6435. $  There! You’re all set to work with the latest sources.  The last thing you need is a Ruby setup, with Ruby and Rake executa- bles. You can learn how to do that in Appendix C, on page 414.  Road to Glory: Creating Patches  Writing a patch is as simple as getting into the trunk’s src directory and changing the appropriate .js ﬁle. Once this is done, you need to rebuild the consolidated prototype.js ﬁle. To do this, from somewhere in the trunk’s directory tree, just type rake dist. This will build the library ﬁle in the trunk’s dist directory. This ﬁle is used by the tests.  Working with Tests When you’re done with a patch, make sure you run the proper test ﬁles. Simply open them in the browsers you have handy. Passing tests go green, and failing ones go red. This can actually be a way to contribute. Run all the tests, ﬁnd the failing ones, and go ﬁgure out what’s wrong and ﬁx them!  To see tests in action, just do this:  1. Fire up your trusty browser. Have it open the test unit array.html ﬁle. The page loads, runs all its tests, and is done. If everything is groovy, they all pass, as in Figure A.3, on the following page.  2. Now open src array.js and break something! For instance, change ﬁrst    to return null instead of this[0]. Rebuild the library  rake dist, remember? , and refresh the test page in your browser. It should look like Figure A.4, on the next page.  3. OK, you just ruined this ﬁle. Undo by hand and rebuild, or just use Subversion to revert to the latest checked-out version: svn revert src array.js.   CONTRIBUTING!  408  Figure A.3: A ﬂurry of passing tests  Figure A.4: Oops! We broke something!   CONTRIBUTING!  409  When your patch is done, make sure you provide good test coverage. Figure out as many things as you can that seem to need tests, and then write those tests in a way that will fail without your patch. Test with and without your patch applied. You can even run all tests automatically by using rake test. It runs all the tests on all the available browsers  which some tests, like Ajax ones, require so they get a valid server side . You can restrict it by using its BROWSERS and TESTS variables.  The test ﬁles are located in the test subdirectory, with the unit tests in test unit. Just look at the large inline scripts in there for inspiration on how to add tests to the suites.  Packaging, Submitting, and Cleaning Up All set? Then package your patch as a Subversion diff ﬁle. It’s easy, really. Just go to the trunk’s base directory, and do something like this:  $ svn diff > good_patch_name.diff $  You might want to put these ﬁles outside the trunk directory. Then go to the Trac, edit or create the proper ticket, and attach your patch to it. Add a comment to add whatever explanations are required about this patch. Update the summary if need be.  Also, don’t forget to revert your trunk directory to its normal state before tackling any other work or updating it once again. Just go the trunk’s base directory, and do this:  $ svn revert -R . Reverted 'src array.js' $  Code Style Guidelines    Indent with two spaces, not tabs. Make sure your editor of choice doesn’t use some autoﬁll mode that will convert given amounts of spaces to tabs automatically.    Use expressive variable names; n, e, or ePC won’t quite cut it.    Use semicolons to terminate statements.    If possible, use Unix line breaks.   CONTRIBUTING!  410    Just look at the existing source code for inspiration about general code architecture and layout. Avoid polluting the global namespace as much as possible; put function-speciﬁc constants, variables, and subfunctions in the calling function’s prototype; and so on.    Notice some low-hanging fruit  trivial ﬁx about performance or  cleanliness ? Pick it!  Common Pitfalls    First, don’t go writing a patch that will end up being considered invalid  see earlier in this chapter about such cases . Also make sure you’re not duplicating an existing effort.    Make sure you revert your local repository before starting up on a  new patch so you don’t aggregate it with prior patching work.    Make sure you update your local repository, too, so you do patch  against the latest trunk  revert before updating .    The tests keep failing? Are you sure you rebuilt the library  rake  dist  after saving the source ﬁle?    Make sure you test in at least two browsers, one of which must be Firefox. If you’re on Linux, try testing on Firefox and Konqueror, at least. If you’re on Mac OS X, use Firefox, Safari  ideally 2 and 3 , and perhaps Opera. If you’re on Windows, go crazy and use Firefox, Internet Explorer  ideally both versions 6 and 7 , Opera 9 or later, and perhaps even Safari 3!  We’re looking forward to your contributions!

Appendix C Installing and Using Ruby  Although Prototype and script.aculo.us are totally agnostic about the server side, I chose to use Ruby when writing the small servers for Ajax-based examples. The reasons for this are many:    Using server layers such as JavaEE, ASP.NET, or PHP requires some serious setup on your machine if it’s not already your work- ing environment. Sure, there are tools like EasyPHP for Windows, but that leaves out other platforms.    JavaEE and ASP.NET require too much groundwork in order to get a working page. There’s project creation, server conﬁguration, and more. And with PHP, unless you’re using EasyPHP, there’s a lot of setup to do as well, binding it to a web server, and so on.    I just don’t like PHP all that much, too.    Getting the server technology up and running, in the context of this book, should be as unobtrusive as possible. Monitoring the server side should be easy, too, in case you mistype the scripts. This book is about Prototype and script.aculo.us, not about server-side technologies.  So, I chose Ruby, because it’s simple enough for non-Rubyists to grasp quickly  or at least, get the hang of how the script works , it’s simple to install on most platforms  when it’s not already there , and there’s zero setup groundwork when you need a server with dynamic contents.  To run the examples in this book, you will thus need to have Ruby installed on your machine. This is pretty easy to do, and this appendix will show you how.   ON WINDOWS  415  C.1 On Windows  The golden way to go for Microsoft Windows is to use the 1-Click Ruby Installer, a package maintained on RubyForge. Its home page is at http:  rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org wiki wiki.pl?RubyInstaller, with the latest download  Ruby 1.8.6  at the time of this writing being accessible at http:  rubyforge.org frs download.php 18566 ruby186-25.exe.  This installer does not only contain Ruby but also popular tools, exten- sions, and documentation ﬁles in various formats. If all you need is Ruby itself, you can go with the binary download at ftp:  ftp.ruby-lang.org pub ruby binaries mswin32 r  C.2 On Linux  Well, chances are you already have Ruby installed if you’re running Linux. It’s used by many system tools. Open a console, and try the following command:  $ ruby -v ruby 1.8.6  2007-03-13 patchlevel 0  [i486-linux]  If you get a Command not found error, you don’t have it yet. But fear not—all you need to do is install the relevant packages. Depending on your distribution, the package system will vary, but the package name is usually ruby. There are currently packages for Debian, Mandriva, SuSE, Red Hat Linux, BSDs, and a number of their variants  including Ubuntu, OpenSuSE, Fedora, and more . Slackware also gets packages through LinuxPackages.net, for instance.  If you plan only to run the examples in this book, that’s all you need. If you plan to tinker a bit more with Ruby, you’ll probably want irb  interactive Ruby shell, great to try stuff out  and ri  the help browser , too.  For instance, on Debian and its derivates  for example, Ubuntu , all you need to do is something like this:  $ sudo apt-get install ruby irb ri   Note that if you use Ubuntu or its derivatives, you’ll have to enable the universe repository to get these.    ON MAC OS X  416  C.3 On Mac OS X  OS X is now in a love affair with Ruby and Ruby on Rails, which mostly shows in Leopard  OS X 10.5, just released as this book is going to press . Depending on the version of OS X you have, there are a bunch of options for binaries:    Panther  10.3 , Tiger  10.4  and Leopard  10.5  have Ruby 1.8 pre- installed; Leopard features version 1.8.6, which is the latest one at the time of this writing.    Jaguar  10.2 : there’s a .dmg package for Ruby 1.8.2 available at  http:  homepage.mac.com discord Ruby.  If you’re technically savvy, you can naturally elect to grab the source for the latest version and compile it yourself: ftp:  ftp.ruby-lang.org pub ruby ruby-1.8.6.tar.gz. A middle-of-the-road approach would be to use tools such as MacPorts1 or Fink2; for instance, with MacPorts, you can grab Ruby like this:  $ port install ruby  C.4 Running a Ruby Script  The universal way of running a Ruby script is simply to pass its ﬁle- name to the ruby interpreter. For instance, you would open a command prompt, move into the script’s directory, and invoke the interpreter on it. For instance:  $ ruby server.rb  In all our server-side examples for this book, we use Ruby’s inclusion of the WEBrick module in its standard library to provide us with a work- ing, lightweight HTTP server that can still run Ruby code dynamically. To make things simpler, WEBrick will, by default, do all its logging on the script’s standard output, which is your console window. We can make it very easy to stop, too. Just press Ctrl+C in the console win- dow once it’s running.  This all makes it very easy to run a server, track its logs, and stop it, especially when compared to other server-side solutions.  1. http:  www.macports.org  2. http:  ﬁnk.sourceforge.net    C.5 “But I Don’t Know a Thing About Ruby!”  “BUT I DON’T KNOW A THING ABOUT RUBY!”  417  Have no fear, have no fear. Ruby is the kind of language you can quickly get the basics of; it follows the principle of least surprise. To newcomers, a piece of Ruby code often does what it seems to be doing. And the code in this book refrains from using too much Ruby-fu so as not to make your head spin.  At any rate, if you’re interested into learning more about this wonderful language, the prime resource to head for is the ofﬁcial website, which links to everything you’ll need to quickly get on the saddle, from 20- minute tutorials to book-length material.  The ofﬁcial site is at http:  ruby-lang.org.  Here are some great write-ups that will take you less than an hour and equip you with everything you need to comfortably wade through the examples:  http:  tryruby.hobix.com   An interactive, 15-minute demo. It’s entirely online and doesn’t require you to install Ruby ﬁrst! Coming from the infamous Why The Lucky Stiff, it’s very funny to walk through, too.  http:  www.ruby-lang.org en documentation quickstart   A 20-minute intro to Ruby, which is pretty cool to help you dive in. Like a lot of documentation on the Ruby ofﬁcial website, it’s avail- able in a variety of languages, usually including English, French, Spanish, and Japanese.  http:  www.ruby-lang.org en documentation ruby-from-other-languages   Ruby is very cool, but coming from other languages can sometimes inhibit us with bred reﬂexes as to what is or is not possible and how to achieve certain results. This write-up highlights important points and idioms every newcomer should know in order to take best advantage of Ruby’s syntax and possibilities.  You’ll ﬁnd a lot more material, including books  sometimes very offbeat ones, such as “Why’s  poignant  guide to Ruby”  on the documentation page at http:  www.ruby-lang.org en documentation .

Tired of getting swamped in the nitty-gritty of cross-browser, Web 2.0-grade JavaScript? Get back in the game with Prototype and script.aculo.us, two extremely popular JavaScript libraries, that make it a walk in the park. Be it AJAX, drag and drop, auto-completion, advanced visual effects, or many other great features, all you need is write one or two lines of script that look so good they could almost pass for Ruby code!

Web applications are getting richer and richer, with more interaction baked in every day. But JavaScript, DOM, CSS and a full host of other Web standards are quite complex, and the result isn't always browser compliant.

The Prototype and script.aculo.us libraries are veritable treasure troves, smoothing over all the usual nitty-gritty differences between browsers, and making most common features a breeze to implement. With this book, you can quickly wield the whole power of these extraordinary libraries.

Dive into Prototype, the library that makes JavaScript so much more powerful, and it looks a lot like Ruby code. Exploring the DOM, handling events, taming AJAX, and radically simplifying most of your scripting code: it all becomes easy-and very portable-with Prototype.

When it comes to advanced UI features, script.aculo.us is every web developer's dream come true: whether you need to create auto-completed text inputs, implement in-place editors, provide customized drag-and-drop behaviors, capture your users' attention with visual effects or simply build DOM fragments more efficiently, it's all there, and lightweight too.

This book guides you through all the details of these features, letting you use many technologies on the server side, such as PHP, vanilla Ruby, and Ruby On Rails, in countless examples illustrating every aspect. Power users will also learn the design philosophies of the libraries, and how to contribute to them and augment them for their own needs.
