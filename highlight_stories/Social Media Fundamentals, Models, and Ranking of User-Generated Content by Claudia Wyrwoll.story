Foreword  When Carl Adam Petri, the father of Petri Nets, entitled his PhD Thesis “Communication with Automata” in 1962, almost no one un- derstood that the computer was on its way to become a new medium. This title had two interpretations: interaction with computers can be understood as a special form of communication: human-computer communication. This view has inﬂuenced my professional life when becoming a specialist in usability. The other interpretation is: people communicate via computers. In 1962 a bold vision. But the tech- nical basis for this view was already on its way: the concept for a computer network was published in the same year by Joseph C. R. Licklider  the author of “Man-Computer Symbiosis”—the ﬁrst inter- pretation  and others. This work on packet-switched networks led to the ARPA-Net and ﬁnally to the Internet. Scientists used this network since 1970. Networked computers became the norm. The topic of computer-supported cooperative work with new problems of usability emerged. This became my second ﬁeld of interest. A lead- ing question was: how can we design computer applications in such a way that users can understand and use them easily?  The publicly available Internet is now with us for 25 years, often considered identical with the World Wide Web  WWW . Since Tim Berners-Lee published the ﬁrst web browser in 1992, the WWW evolved into a complete new medium used by everybody. The over- whelming mass of information asked for new ways of accessing. Search engines like Google were the answer 16 years ago. Meanwhile it has become normal to “google” an answer for any kind of question. In many cases very successfully.   VIII  Foreword  The Internet enabled not only the distribution of information provided by specialists, it allowed to implement new services which were called Web 2.0, services which enable anyone to be author and reader. New platforms emerged which are called social media: blogs, forums, me- dia sharing platforms, social networks, etc. The daily reality of many people is governed by Google, Facebook, Twitter, and the like. These platforms provide an unbelievable amount of user-generated content to the public. Surprisingly, there are almost no tools to exploit the richness of this information. Current search engines are not adequate, since their basic unit of search is a web page while social media have a diﬀerent granularity. For collecting and ranking user-generated content across social media platforms there was no solution before Claudia Wyrwoll started her PhD-work three years ago.  The publication of her results shows that this diﬃcult problem can be solved exploiting the meta-data provided by social media. I am convinced that her concept can be the basis for a new generation of user-adequate tools for the exploitation of the richness of information contained and provided in social media.

Tim Berners-Lee  1996, p. 69   The Web revolutionized communication twice. First, when it was invented, and second, when social media enabled people, who are no computer specialists, to make content publicly available to other users. Earlier broadcasting media could not be used by private individuals to broadcast their thoughts. Figure 1.1 illustrates how people could reach unacquainted others before the advent of social media.  The possibility for everyone to easily publish and share content with the public through the World Wide Web has changed communica- tion. Social media has transformed mass communication from the monopoly of the unidirectional communication medium of the tradi- tional mass media  i.e., printing press, television and radio  to multi- directional communication where everyone can participate. Social media facilitated a shift from a consume-oriented communication cul- ture to a communication culture of participation. A world in which a small number of people report, create, decide, and form opinions is de- veloping into a world in which everyone has opportunities to actively participate  Fischer, 2011 . The advantages of this are manifold.  C. Wyrwoll, Social Media, DOI 10.1007 978-3-658-06984-1_1,   Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden 2014   2  1 Introduction  Content created by users and made publicly available online becomes an alternative news source. In combination with the last decade’s achievements in hardware development, equipping a huge part of the world with mobile devices with camera and mobile access to the Inter- net, anyone could be the one to post something as it happens making it news, if only enough others consider it relevant. The possibility for everyone to create content and make it publicly available also em- powers civil rights movements, because it is not as easily controlled and censored as centralized traditional mass media. The possibility for consumers to connect and share their experiences and grievances facilitates ethical consumerism. Consumer-generated content ener- vates the power of marketing communications. It also becomes a new source for market research.  And as more people participate, more content is created, shared and available. The social network Facebook  2013  counts 1.15 billion monthly active users as of June 2013. The microblogging service Twit- ter has “well over 200 million active users creating over 400 million Tweets each day”  Wickre, 2013 . 100 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute  Youtube, 2013 . The blogging platform Tumblr hosts 141.1 million blogs with 63.8 billion content units avail- able  Tumblr, 2013b .  As more content is created at higher frequency, new challenges arise. Already in 1945, long before the success of the Internet, Bush  1945, p. 38  pointed out that there is too much information to make use of it: “The diﬃculty seems to be not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that publication has been extended far beyond our present day abil- ity to make real use of the record.” The rapidly growing volume of information available online makes it increasingly diﬃcult for users to ﬁnd what they are looking for. From the tremendous amount of information available users need to ﬁnd information and then evalu- ate it. In the context of social media, users are not only interested in content that refers to a speciﬁc topic. Independent of the topic, users may be interested in criteria such as the popularity of user-generated   1 Introduction  3  Figure 1.1: Speakers’ Corner.  The Speakers’ Corner is a place of free speech. Before arrival of Internet and social media, this was the only possibility that private individuals, who do not happen to be journalists and do not have a publisher, could reach people they did not know.

Search engines based on query-dependent ranking support users insuﬃciently in this task, because they have two major weak- nesses: they require the user to specify a search term and they neglect the speciﬁcs of user-generated content.  Currently, users can evaluate content by consuming and judging the value of the content. Furthermore, various types of additional inform- ation is available as metadata that can be used to classify content. An example are ratings by other users. Unfortunately, users have to ana- lyze this information manually. For the majority of users it is there- fore a major problem to distinguish good from bad results  Jansen, Zhang & Zhang, 2007; Keane, O’Brien & Smyth, 2008 . Finding and classifying content is therefore an often time consuming research pro- cess. Statistics and rankings, if available, are platform-speciﬁc. Users have no possibility to compare contributions from diﬀerent platforms.  For computer science, the challenge is to develop solutions that sup- port users in the task of coping with the massive amount of data across platforms. A solution that allows to compare user-generated content from diﬀerent platforms and allows to establish a ranking among them based on the additional information users evaluate manu- ally, can help users in the selection and evaluation process. The goal of this work is to develop a solution that allows to compare and rank user-generated content across platforms by exploiting the information that can be derived from the metadata.  This gives rise to the problem that user-generated content units are diﬃcult to compare, because the number and type of avail- able metadata diﬀers among platforms. There are many diﬀerent metadata that can be used by users to judge content. Some of which are commonly provided for every type of user-generated content. Oth- ers are speciﬁc to a certain social media type. These metadata have neither been collected nor classiﬁed yet.  Page, Brin, Motwani & Winograd  1998  saw themselves confronted with a similar problem. The World Wide Web grew fast and they searched for a new solution to retrieve relevant Web pages, which   1 Introduction  5  they considered to be extremely diverse. They proposed a query- independent link-based ranking approach for Web pages. Link-based approaches that perform well on the task of ranking Web pages do not suﬃce for user-generated content. User-generated content requires a diﬀerent level of granularity. Because one Web page can contain more than one user-generated content unit. Furthermore, the additional information that is available for user-generated content—but not for Web pages—remains unutilized.  Related work can be located in two ﬁelds of research. First of all, information retrieval, which addresses the problem of retrieval and ranking. Information retrieval oﬀers query-dependent as well as query-independent methods. The subject matters of these methods range from plain text documents to Web pages. Secondly, there is a relatively new research community that addresses the automated analysis of user-generated content. Research goals range from quanti- fying quality of user-generated content from Wikipedia to identifying high quality answers from Yahoo Answers  Anderka, Stein & Lipka, 2011a; Agichtein, Castillo, Donato, Gionis & Mishne, 2008 . Existing research for automated rating and ranking of user-generated content focuses on platform-speciﬁc approaches. From a user’s point of view, platform-speciﬁc approaches have the disadvantage that they do not allow to compare content from diﬀerent platforms. With platform- speciﬁc approaches it is not possible to gain an overview over content from several platforms.  The focus of this work is on query-independent ranking. This has several reasons. First of all, query-independent ranking allows the user to discover content without requiring him to specify a search topic. Secondly, query-dependent ranking has been studied thor- oughly. Information retrieval provides several well-established meth- ods for query-dependent ranking. Known approaches for query- dependent ranking can be applied to texts from user-generated con- tent similarly as they are applied to other texts. Furthermore, there are also several known approaches to combine query-dependent with query-independent ranking  Craswell, Robertson, Zaragoza & Taylor,   6  1 Introduction  2005 . Thus, the focus on query-independent ranking still allows to combine it with query-dependent ranking, if desired.  In the ﬁeld of information retrieval we can diﬀerentiate between global and personalized search  Marchionini & Shneiderman, 1988 . Person- alized search systems use personal information about a user’s search history and habits to re-rank the search results according to the user’s interests and preferences  Ahn & Brusilovsky, 2009 . A considerable amount of recent work about search engines focuses on the possibilit- ies to personalize search results, assuming that the user can be served better if preferences, interests and search history are known to the system  e.g., Wang, He, Chang, Song, White & Chu, 2013; Kim, Rawashdeh & El Saddik, 2011; Shen, Tan & Zhai, 2005 . Personaliz- ation applies a pool of techniques aimed to improve search by taking advantage of the user’s preferences. This work explicitly excludes personalized search due to several reasons. It has to be considered that users do not only beneﬁt from personalized search. When people form attitudes, those are assembled from believes about the object’s characteristics, feelings and emotions about it and information about past and current actions toward the object. Accessible information dominates attitude judgments  Smith, 2007 . If users only ﬁnd what pleases them, this holds the risk of creating the illusion of an artiﬁ- cially noncontroversial world, in which users only see the section of the world that conforms to their interests and opinions. Personalized search approaches generate search results that tend to conﬁrm the user’s opinions and views instead of delivering the results that repres- ent a realistic distribution of opinions. Pariser calls this phenomenon the ﬁlter bubble. The ﬁlter bubble, that results from personalized search, holds personal and cultural threads. It surrounds users with ideas with which they are already familiar making them overconﬁdent in their mental frameworks. Furthermore, it removes chance encoun- ters from the informational environment that would bring insight and learning. Personalization could prevent users from coming into con- tact with new information and ideas that can change the way they think about the world  Pariser, 2011 . The circumstance that most   1 Introduction  7  users do not know that search results are personalized aggravates the ﬁlter bubble eﬀect  Hannak, Sapiezynski, Molavi Kakhki, Krish- namurthy, Lazer, Mislove & Wilson, 2013 . Personalized search holds the risk of unwanted and unrecognized manipulation. Furthermore, personalized search requires the collection of personal data and holds the risk of violation of privacy rights. For these reasons, personalized search is not considered any further in this work.  This work aims at a language-independent solution, because this al- lows to apply the approach to user-generated content independent of origin and language. The Web was meant to be an information system for the entire world and that is what it became  Berners-Lee, 1996, p. 69 . Like the Web in general, user-generated content is a world wide matter. The advantages of language-independence are hence especially substantial: A language-independent approach allows to compare user-generated content worldwide. Moreover, the adaption of a language-dependent approach to other languages requires ad- ditional resources, which are spared in a language-independent ap- proach. Language-dependent approaches usually exploit language speciﬁcs, which do not always have correspondents in other languages. It can then be diﬃcult if not impossible to apply such an approach to other languages. If a language-dependent approach is transferable, this can be complex and costly. An eﬀort that is less likely to be made if a language is spoken by fewer people or in parts of the developing world.  This work addresses the above described problem for content that is contributed to the World Wide Web by one author and is publicly available. Hence, this work does not aim at a solution that is also applicable to collaboratively created content. It does also not cover private communication that is transferred via the Internet.1  This work aims to contribute a solution that allows to compare user- generated content by diﬀerent metadata. This work does not intend  1Chapter 2 elaborately delimits user-generated content and the concept public  as subject matter of this work.   8  1 Introduction  to evaluate the value of information provided by these metadata. It is assumed that metadata—such as the number of people who read, liked and recommended a contribution—provide valuable information for the user’s orientation. This work shall contribute to transparency, overview and comparability of these measures to support users in their task of discovery and evaluation of user-generated content. It does not aim at investigating the correlation of these measures and an assumed objective quality of the content, determined for example by experts.2  Information scientists build systems designed to be used by others. Consequently, the way a system is designed potentially aﬀects many people. This is a task that involves responsibility. The ranking ap- proach for user-generated content developed in this work is also in- tended to be used by many users. There are decisions that have been made based on other considerations than what is technically possible, feasible and eﬃcient. Analyzing user-generated content tends to be associated with concerns about user’s privacy. It is not always tech- nically impossible to exploit user data beyond the user’s knowledge and approval. Striving for responsible system design, requirements and conditions are imposed as follows:  1. The user’s privacy needs to be respected.  If content is made publicly available, it is assumed that the author intended to present this contribution publicly. If content is made available for a speciﬁed audience, content should not be crawled, analyzed and presented to other users.  2. If crawling is not desired, this is respected.  Providers of online platforms might disapprove of crawling techno-  2For example, a research question could also be, what kind of user-generated content users prefer. An imaginable result could be that well-written, long, informative essays are poorly rated by other users, whereas the comparison- rating of an expert group rates those contributions as excellent. Thus, it could be concluded that other users’ ratings and quality do not correlate. But, it is not the intention of this work to evaluate the preferences of a group of experts against the preferences of Internet users.   1 Introduction  9  logies that go through the content to store or analyze it. Whether crawling is desired can be declared in robot.txt. Every crawler that is used for the purpose of this work needs to parse a platform’s robot.txt for approval before collecting data.  3. The solution should aim at comprehensibility.  The aspired modeling for the ranking should be transparent and easy to understand for the user. It should not only deliver a good relevance ranking, but also allow the user to comprehend its ele- ments. Background of this consideration is that an algorithm that is transparent to the user is less prone to manipulation. Addition- ally, the user should not have to comprehend the ranking to be able to use it.  The methodology applied to develop a solution to the problem com- prises the following steps: First, a classiﬁcation based on similarities among platforms is introduced. Then, available metadata is collec- ted for representative platforms of each category. The collection of metadata is then analyzed for commonalities throughout platforms and platform-speciﬁc metadata. A model for metadata is introduced that comprises the structure all user-generated content units have in common. Based on this, a query-independent ranking approach is developed that allows to compare and rank user-generated content from all categories.  The subsequent chapters of this work are organized as follows:  In Chapter 2 fundamentals, including deﬁnitions and explanations of concepts related to the subject matter and already informally used in this chapter, such as user-generated content, social media, and publishing are introduced. The impact user-generated content has on the individual, society and economy are described. Furthermore, the challenges that accompany user-generated content and how users cope with them are discussed. Finally, weaknesses of existing ap- proaches for the evaluation of user-generated content are addressed.  Chapter 3 provides a summary of the collection and analysis of metadata of user-generated content from all categories. Derived from   10  1 Introduction  the analysis, a structure for user-generated content units that applies to all categories is presented.  Information retrieval is the ﬁeld of research in computer science that provides methods to solve problems concerning retrieval and ranking of documents, though not speciﬁcally for the application domain of user-generated content. Chapter 4 introduces concepts of informa- tion retrieval as means to solve the initial problem. Furthermore, diﬃculties that result from the speciﬁc application-domain of user- generated content are identiﬁed.  Chapter 5 presents a query-independent ranking approach for user- generated content that allows to compare and rank user-generated content units from diﬀerent platforms.  In Chapter 6 a user-generated content discovery engine and a user- generated content search engine are presented as examples for applic- ations of the developed approach.  Finally, Chapter 7 concludes with a summary of the most important results of this work and gives an outline of potentials for further work and research.   2 User-Generated Content  Realizing the value of social media requires innovative computing research.  Shneiderman, Preece & Pirolli  2011, p. 34   Social media, especially user-generated content, is a relatively young ﬁeld of research. A research community is just forming around the topic. There is no common understanding of the subject, yet. There- fore, the following Chapter begins with an introduction of the notion of user-generated content and related terms for the work at hand in Section 2.1. I shall also give a summary of the range of understand- ings existing among other scientists. Furthermore, the classiﬁcation of user-generated content is established that this work is based on.  User-generated content has eﬀects on society, economy and the indi- vidual user himself. The fundamental changes and the potential that user-generated content is accompanied by are addressed in Section 2.2. But, the possibility for every user to publish content also causes a huge amount of information. The navigation through and classiﬁca- tion of this information becomes a growing challenge for users. The user’s possibilities to classify user-generated content today are presen- ted in Section 2.3.  There are several works that aim at social media analysis or rank- ing. Some of them exploit every detail of information given for a speciﬁc kind of user-generated content allowing interesting computer- generated insights. The more an approach is specialized for a speciﬁc  C. Wyrwoll, Social Media, DOI 10.1007 978-3-658-06984-1_2,   Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden 2014   12  2 User-Generated Content  platform, the more it tends to exploit platform speciﬁcs, which are diﬃcult to transfer to other platforms. The specialization causes a lack of cross-platform comparability. Existing approaches and their compatibility with other platforms are subject of Section 2.4.  2.1 What User-Generated Content Is and What  It Is Not  There are several diﬀerent terms that evolved around the subject of user-generated content and the technology that enables its creation. Web 2.0, social media, social Web, read write Web, social comput- ing, social software, collective action tools, socio-technical systems, computer-mediated communication, consumer-generated media, user- generated content, virtual communities, online communities are some of them. For each term there is a variety of notions. In the following, the terminology used in the work at hand is introduced. Additionally, an overview of the variety of notions in related works is provided.  2.1.1 Terminology for Key Concepts Used in this Work  The democratization of information, the shift from one-to-many to many-to-many communication, and the transformation from consum- ing to publishing users of the Internet are essential aspects of social media  e.g., Lessig, 2001; M¨unker, 2009; Hansen, Shneiderman & Smith, 2010; Solis, 2010; Anderson, 2012 . The user’s ability to make content available to many people forms the basis of these aspects. Making content available to a large group once required printing and a publisher. Through social media it has become possible for almost1  1Of course, there are still basic requirements such as online access. It is important to be aware of potential regional diﬀerences. Inequalities in terms of access to information and communication technologies between countries or regions are known as digital divide. The world share of internet users grew from 18 percent in 2006 to 35 percent in 2011. Still, regional diﬀerences remain.   2.1 What User-Generated Content Is and What It Is Not  13  everyone to make information publicly available without the need of a publisher.  According to the Encyclopædia Britannica  2007, p. 415 , publishing is “the activity that involves the selection, preparation, and distribu- tion of written and visual matter.” Examples for published matter are books, magazines and newspapers. The traditional view of publishing regards only printed matters as published matters. But, since “elec- tronic books and online newspapers” are also reckoned to be types of publishing, the printed form is no longer a requirement for publishing  Encyclopædia Britannica, 2007, p. 416 . The Encyclopædia Britan- nica itself—after a history of almost 240 years of printed editions2—is no longer printed, but is exclusively accessible online.3 Although, in many cases of digital publishing the principles of printed publishing still apply, it becomes diﬃcult to mark the boundaries of publishing clearly. The technical progress has changed the traditional notion of publishing.  To apply the concept of publishing in the context of social media, it has to be rendered more precisely. In the context of this work, to publish means making information publicly available. To adapt the concept to social media, several levels of public are distinguished. General public means that no receiver is speciﬁed by the contrib- uting user. The content is available for everyone. This means that the audience is potentially unlimited. Limited public means that no receiver is explicitly speciﬁed by the contributing user, but the audience is limited. The limitation can be caused by platforms that require registration prior to reading. This is the case, for example, if a platform presents its content only to registered users; although anyone might be admitted to register, the audience is limited to the re-  Average Internet penetration levels in developing regions rose to 26 percent by 2011. In sub-Saharan Africa however, they remain below 15 percent.  United Nations, 2012   2The ﬁrst edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica was issued in 1768  Encyc-  lopædia Britannica, 2007 . The last printed version was published in 2007.  3http:  www.britannica.com    14  2 User-Generated Content  gistered users. Limited public can be subdivided into known-limited public and unknown-limited public. Known-limited public com- prises the cases when no receiver is speciﬁed but the audience is limited to known people. An example is content shared with a group, such as friends in social networks.4 This example illustrates that known-limited public is similar to private. Unknown-limited pub- lic describes the case when the audience is limited but not exclusively to known people. An example is when content is shared with a closed community such as friends of friends in social networks.  If the audience is limited to speciﬁed receivers, it is called private. In the context of this work, private communication is not user-generated content. This means, telephone calls, written letters, faxes, emails, SMS, instant messages, and so on, do not fall under the notion of user-generated content as it is used in this thesis. However, private communication can be part of a social media platform. Social net- works for instance, usually allow to publish content to the general public, to a limited public as well as private messages.  In social media, the user who contributes a piece of content does not need to deﬁne his audience, but he can limit the audience. Reach is the number of people who receive a message. The less the audience is limited by a contributor, the more potential reach the message has. The degree of intimacy increases with limitation of the audience. Fig- ure 2.1 shows the private and public levels of communication. Their characteristics are illustrated in relation to reach and intimacy.  This notion of public, adapted for user-generated content, replaces the concept of sender and receiver by contributor and audience. The contributor is the user who published a message. The contributor does not necessarily have to be the creator of the content. Whether or not the contributor is the creator of the content, in social media he is usually5 displayed as author and will therefore be referred to as author.  4For more information about social networks refer to Subsection 2.1.3 5In some cases, platforms display citations.   2.1 What User-Generated Content Is and What It Is Not  15   cid:13  cid:31  cid:24  cid:35  cid:16  cid:33  cid:20  cid:1  cid:18  cid:29  cid:27  cid:27  cid:34  cid:28  cid:24  cid:18  cid:16  cid:33  cid:24  cid:29  cid:28  cid:1    cid:12  cid:20  cid:35  cid:20  cid:26  cid:32  cid:1  cid:29  cid:21   cid:1  cid:30  cid:34  cid:17  cid:26  cid:24  cid:18  cid:1    cid:12  cid:24  cid:27  cid:24  cid:33  cid:20  cid:19  cid:1  cid:30  cid:34  cid:17  cid:26  cid:24  cid:18  cid:1   cid:1  cid:1  cid:31  cid:20  cid:18  cid:20  cid:24  cid:35  cid:20  cid:31  cid:1  cid:28  cid:29  cid:33  cid:1  cid:32  cid:30  cid:20  cid:18  cid:24  cid:21  cid:24  cid:20  cid:19  cid:1   cid:1  cid:1  cid:16  cid:34  cid:19  cid:24  cid:20  cid:28  cid:18  cid:20  cid:1  cid:26  cid:24  cid:27  cid:24  cid:33  cid:20  cid:19  cid:1    cid:7  cid:29  cid:28  cid:33  cid:31  cid:24  cid:17  cid:34  cid:33  cid:29  cid:31  cid:1    cid:13  cid:31  cid:24  cid:35  cid:16  cid:33  cid:20  cid:1   cid:1  cid:1  cid:16  cid:34  cid:19  cid:24  cid:20  cid:28  cid:18  cid:20  cid:1  cid:26  cid:24  cid:27  cid:24  cid:33  cid:20  cid:19  cid:1  cid:33  cid:29  cid:1   cid:32  cid:30  cid:20  cid:18  cid:24  cid:21  cid:24  cid:20  cid:19  cid:1  cid:31  cid:20  cid:18  cid:20  cid:24  cid:35  cid:20  cid:31  cid:2  cid:32  cid:3  cid:1  cid:1   cid:1  cid:1  cid:28  cid:29  cid:33  cid:1  cid:30  cid:34  cid:17  cid:26  cid:24  cid:18  cid:1   cid:1  cid:1  cid:8  cid:5  cid:22  cid:5  cid:1  cid:8  cid:27  cid:16  cid:24  cid:26  cid:1    cid:11  cid:28  cid:29  cid:36  cid:28  cid:4  cid:1  cid:26  cid:24  cid:27  cid:24  cid:33  cid:20  cid:19  cid:1  cid:30  cid:34  cid:17  cid:26  cid:24  cid:18  cid:1   cid:1  cid:1  cid:16  cid:34  cid:19  cid:24  cid:20  cid:28  cid:18  cid:20  cid:1  cid:26  cid:24  cid:27  cid:24  cid:33  cid:20  cid:19  cid:1  cid:33  cid:29  cid:1  cid:25  cid:28  cid:29  cid:36  cid:28  cid:1   cid:30  cid:20  cid:29  cid:30  cid:26  cid:20  cid:1  cid:1   cid:1  cid:1  cid:20  cid:5  cid:22  cid:5  cid:1  cid:38  cid:21  cid:31  cid:24  cid:20  cid:28  cid:19  cid:32  cid:39  cid:1  cid:24  cid:28  cid:1  cid:32  cid:29  cid:18  cid:24  cid:16  cid:26  cid:1   cid:28  cid:20  cid:33  cid:36  cid:29  cid:31  cid:25  cid:32  cid:1    cid:15  cid:28  cid:25  cid:28  cid:29  cid:36  cid:28  cid:4  cid:1  cid:26  cid:24  cid:27  cid:24  cid:33  cid:20  cid:19  cid:1  cid:30  cid:34  cid:17  cid:26  cid:24  cid:18  cid:1   cid:1  cid:1  cid:16  cid:34  cid:19  cid:24  cid:20  cid:28  cid:18  cid:20  cid:1  cid:26  cid:24  cid:27  cid:24  cid:33  cid:20  cid:19  cid:1  cid:24  cid:28  cid:18  cid:26  cid:34  cid:19  cid:24  cid:28  cid:22  cid:1  cid:1   cid:34  cid:28  cid:25  cid:28  cid:29  cid:36  cid:28  cid:1  cid:30  cid:20  cid:29  cid:30  cid:26  cid:20  cid:1  cid:1   cid:1  cid:1  cid:20  cid:5  cid:22  cid:5  cid:1  cid:38  cid:21  cid:31  cid:24  cid:20  cid:28  cid:19  cid:32  cid:1  cid:29  cid:21   cid:1  cid:21  cid:31  cid:24  cid:20  cid:28  cid:19  cid:32  cid:39  cid:1  cid:1   cid:24  cid:28  cid:1  cid:32  cid:29  cid:18  cid:24  cid:16  cid:26  cid:1  cid:28  cid:20  cid:33  cid:36  cid:29  cid:31  cid:25  cid:32  cid:1    cid:9  cid:20  cid:28  cid:20  cid:31  cid:16  cid:26  cid:1  cid:30  cid:34  cid:17  cid:26  cid:24  cid:18  cid:1   cid:1  cid:1  cid:34  cid:28  cid:26  cid:24  cid:27  cid:24  cid:33  cid:20  cid:19  cid:1  cid:16  cid:34  cid:19  cid:24  cid:20  cid:28  cid:18  cid:20  cid:1    cid:6  cid:34  cid:19  cid:24  cid:20  cid:28  cid:18  cid:20  cid:1    cid:14  cid:20  cid:16  cid:18  cid:23  cid:1    cid:10  cid:28  cid:33  cid:24  cid:27  cid:16  cid:18  cid:37  cid:1   Figure 2.1: Reach-Intimacy-Model.  The Reach-Intimacy-Model illustrates private communica- tion and the levels of public for user-generated content in relation to reach and intimacy. Private communication is not regarded as user-generated content.  In the context of this work, the central characteristic for user- generated content is the possibility for users to publish content to others.  User-generated content is content published on an online platform by users. The term social media comprises platforms that contain user-generated content. Users do not need programming skills to publish content on a social media platform.  Whether content contributed by a company on a social media plat- form is considered user-generated content, depends on the notion of user. User can refer to the user of a social media platform. In this case, the content contributed by a company on a social media plat-   16  2 User-Generated Content  form would be regarded as user-generated content. User can also refer to private individual as opposed to professional or business per- son. In this case, the content contributed by a company on a social media platform would not be considered user-generated content. In the context of this work, user refers to the user of a social media platform.  For search engines the smallest unit is a Web page with a URL as identiﬁer. For user-generated content this view does not suﬃciently apply. One Web page, one URL usually contains several social media entries from diﬀerent authors. For social media the smallest unit is the user-generated content unit. A user-generated content unit is one single contribution by one author at a given time. Collaboratively created content usually has more than one author. This case is not covered in this thesis.  A user-generated content unit consists of core data and metadata. The given piece of information—the content—is the core data. Metadata is information about a given piece of information  Baeza- Yates & Ribeiro-Neto, 2003 . Examples for metadata about user- generated content are date of publication, status of the author in the community, and number of views.  In this work, opinions that are expressed by one click are also referred to as one-click-opinions. Examples are Facebook’s likes, Google’s +1, Youtube’s thumbs up, and so on. Ratings of user-generated con- tent units by other users are peer-ratings.  2.1.2 The Variety of Terminologies in Related Works  Aside from the notion of social media and user-generated content used in this work, there is a variety of other notions used in other authors’ works. It is important to be aware of this whenever key terms are used without further explanation. There is no consensus about which platforms and services belong to social media and which do not.   2.1 What User-Generated Content Is and What It Is Not  17  Many works about social media do not explicitly address the question what is meant by social media. This implies that it is often assumed that there is a common understanding about what the term social media refers to. But, a closer look at the uses of the term reveals that there is actually a variety of notions.  One might suspect that because there is not a uniform conception, there are many descriptions in various publications about the topic. But as a matter of fact, attempts to deﬁne the terms are rare. To many it is not exactly clear what social media is and what it is not  Lovett, 2011 . Many existing descriptions for social media are incom- plete, imprecise, or contradicting. Anderson  2012, p. 1  speculates that the reasons for this shortcoming might be the relative novelty of the subject or the “slippery character” of the subject “that’s hard to pin down.”  This is also the case for related terms such as Web 2.0 and user- generated content. Some authors use the terms synonymously to so- cial media, whereas others make a diﬀerence between them. Grabs & Bannour  2011  for example, describe Web 2.0 as the possibility for every user to create content and to share them via diﬀerent chan- nels among each other. They do not diﬀerentiate between the terms Web 2.0 and user-generated content and use them interchangeably. Another example is M¨unker’s interpretation of Web 2.0, which is also very similar to what others describe as social media. He describes Web 2.0 as the trend to design a Web page in a way that it is consid- erably co-designed by its users. The degree of participation may vary from commenting or rating like it is practice at Amazon6 to platforms where the content is exclusively created by users  M¨unker, 2009 .  Others use the term Web 2.0 to stress technical aspects, such as AJAX and open APIs, whereas social Web or social media are used to stress social aspects  e.g., Anderson, 2012; Lessig, 2001 .  The term Web 2.0 has been coined with a diﬀerent meaning. It can be tracked back to Knorr  2003  quoting Dietzen who “calls the Web 2.0,  6http:  www.amazon.com   18  2 User-Generated Content  where the Web becomes a universal, standards-based integration plat- form.” It became popular when O’Reilly  2005  published an article titled “What is Web 2.0” about the ideas and changes behind the Web 2.0 concept.  Despite the expectations the title of the article might evoke, O’Reilly does not describe the Web 2.0 as form or enhancement of the World Wide Web. Instead he uses the term as an adjective and describes principles that he considers as the core competencies of compan- ies that are Web 2.0. Examples are “companies that provide ser- vices with cost-eﬀective scalability instead of packaged software are Web 2.0”, “Web 2.0 companies trust users as co-developers”, and “companies that are Web 2.0 have lightweight user interfaces, de- velopment models and business models”  O’Reilly, 2005 . O’Reilly also provides “Web 2.0 Design Patterns” with recommendations for companies that want to become Web 2.0. These examples illus- trate O’Reilly’s business driven point of view when he uses the term Web 2.0.  Kaplan & Haenlein explicitly address the question of what social media is. Their attempt to deﬁne social media is often referenced  e.g., Fischer & Reuber, 2011; Foster, Francescucci & West, 2010; Nack, 2010; Wikipedia, 2013a,b . Kaplan & Haenlein agree that there seems to be confusion as to what should be included in the term so- cial media and how it diﬀers from Web 2.0. They dedicate a section to the question “What is Social Media—And what is not?” Herein, they characterize social media as “a group of Internet-based applic- ations that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of User Generated Content.” Meanwhile, Web 2.0 is described as “the platform for the evolution of Social Media” and “Web 2.0 represents the ideological and technological foundation.” User-generated content is “the sum of all ways in which people make use of Social Media.”  Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010, p. 60 ﬀ    2.1 What User-Generated Content Is and What It Is Not  19  Rephrasing their circular reference, the three terms are not synonym- ous, but related and are somehow a foundation for each other. Social media refers to applications, Web 2.0 refers to underlying technolo- gical aspects, whereas user-generated content is speciﬁed as “ways of use.” It is a suggestion for how to arrange the concepts towards each other. But Kaplan and Heanlein do not oﬀer a deﬁnition for what social media is and what it is not. They do not specify “people” in context of “user-generated content.” Considering blogs, it remains unclear whether Kaplan & Haenlein would consider blogs published by professionals and journalists as “user-generated content.” Com- panies use microblogs such as Twitter and social networks such as Facebook for communication, too. It is unspeciﬁed whether they re- gard this kind of content “user-generated content.”  There are also inconsistent uses of terms and very broad conceptions that describe much more than online communication and user parti- cipation. Safko  2010, p. 3  claims: “Social media is the media we use to be social. That’s it.” This would also include telephones, emails, letters and so on, none of which are addressed in his book. Hansen et al.  2010, p. 12  see social media as “a set of online tools that supports social interaction between users. The term is often used to contrast with more traditional media such as television and books that deliver content to mass populations but do not facilitate the creation or sharing of content by users.” But then they include also corporate Web sites  e.g., www.ford.com  in their taxonomy of so- cial media, which—as television and books—only deliver content and do not facilitate the creation or sharing of content by users  Hansen et al., 2010 .  Summing up, there is no terminology that is universally agreed upon. A variety of other notions is used in other authors’ works. Recent works which broach the issue of terminology show no clear tendency that the diﬀerent understandings are converging towards a consensus. Consequently, it is important to pay attention to the speciﬁc notions that underlie key terms in other works.   20  2 User-Generated Content  2.1.3 Social Media Categories Used in this Work  Resulting from the divergent comprehension there is a series of dif- ferent opinions about which platforms belong to social media and how they can be categorized. Most works contain enumerations of platforms with an exemplary character instead of methodically built taxonomies. Whenever social media categories are mentioned without further elaboration, there is a range of interpretations.  There are numerous platforms that allow users to publish content and belong to social media. Constantly more are emerging. A proper categorization should include all platforms that meet the underlying deﬁnition of social media. Categories should be methodically derived from a feasible criterion.  In the context of this work, platforms are allocated to categories by the type of metadata provided by the platforms.7 This way to categorize social media platforms is chosen because it is especially suited for query-independent ranking of user-generated content that utilizes metadata to evaluate content units.  The following classiﬁcation will serve as basis of understanding for this work:  1. Blogs  2. Forums  3. Location sharing and annotation platforms  4. Media sharing platforms  5. Microblogs  6. Question and answer platforms  7. Rating and review platforms  8. Social networks  7For the detailed analysis of metadata of user-generated content from diﬀerent  platforms refer to Chapter 3.   2.1 What User-Generated Content Is and What It Is Not  21  The following provides a short characterization for each category. The sets of characteristics of categories are not necessarily disjoint. Some platforms allocated in a certain category can have aspects of other categories. For example, social networks allow to share pictures and videos as it is typical for media sharing platforms.  Blogs are a special form of Web sites keeping publication deceptively simple. Entries are displayed in reverse chronological order, present- ing the most recent entry at the top of the page. The term blog is a short form of Weblog, a neologism derived from the combination of the terms World Wide Web and log as in logbook. Jon Barger coined the term Weblog in 1997  Ammann, 2009 . Shortly after, the term blog was used as noun and verb likewise. The ﬁrst Weblogs were pub- lic online diaries. Blogs can be diﬀerentiated by the number of users authorized to publish blog entries into single- and multi-authored blogs.8 Until the mid 2000s blogs were usually written by one au- thor. In recent years multi-author blogs have become popular as well  Safko, 2010 . Bloggers tend to evolve their blogs around a special interest  Macdonald, Santos, Ounis & Soboroﬀ, 2010 . Blogs can also be distinguished by the degree of professionalism of the content pro- duced into professional- and private-content blogs. Blogs range from personal diaries to professional journalists’ and corporate blogs.  A forum is an online discussion site where people can hold conver- sations in form of posted messages. Conversations are organized in threads and are stored permanently. A thread belongs to a topic. It consists of a root-posting and replies. In open forums content is public and can be read by everyone. In closed forums it is necessary to become a member of the forum-community to read the postings. To actively take part in a discussion it is usually necessary to become a member. Forums have a hierarchic structure. Figure 2.2 illustrates the diﬀerent hierarchy levels of forums. The ﬁrst level displays a list of topics that are covered by the forum. Threads covering the same topic are collected in a sub-forum. Threads are on a lower level. They  8Note that also in multi-authored blogs content units are usually not collaborat-  ively contributed.   22  2 User-Generated Content  start with a root-posting containing a question, topic or statement. A thread consists of one or more postings, which are organized by the time of submission, usually in chronological order. Some forums oﬀer their members the possibility to connect with each other, as it is common in social networks. But unlike in social networks, users can read discussions and contributions whether or not they are con- nected. Members can discuss topics with any other member, being connected is not a precondition. Hence, the average forum user has fewer connections than the average social network user. Forums exist since the early days of the Internet and they form rich repositories of collaborative knowledge  Wanas, El-Saban, Ashour & Ammar, 2008 .  Location sharing and annotation platforms apply location based services that enable groups of friends to share their current location and annotations. Location based services allow people to see where they are geographically with the help of GPS equipped mobile phones. Examples are applications that help the user to nav- igate from A to B, locating others on a map displayed on the phone or receiving information about traﬃc jam ahead  Rogers, Sharp & Preece, 2011 . Examples for location sharing and annotation plat- forms are Foursquare,9 Loopt,10 Facebook Places,11 and Google Lat- itude.12 They allow users to plot their location and share it with other users  Cramer, Rost & Holmquist, 2011 .

Forums ﬁrst provide a list of topics. When a user clicks on a topic he navigates to a list of threads. Threads consist of a root-posting and a list of replies.  Microblogs allow users to share information by broadcasting short, real-time messages. A well-known microblog provider is Twitter.15 People share opinions, daily life activities, news, and so on with friends, families, co-workers, as well as strangers  Grace, Zhao & Boyd, 2010 . Microblogs diﬀer from traditional blogs. Content units are limited in size. A Twitter post for example is limited to 140 char- acters. A microblog entry consists of a short text or a link to images or videos. Due to its size limits, microblogging posts are less dialogue oriented and often focused on one issue  Zhao & Rosson, 2009 . Using  15http:  www.twitter.com   24  2 User-Generated Content  microblogs, the author does not specify a recipient. Every message is public by default and the recipients choose whose messages they read, whom they follow. Users who follow someone are called her follow- ers. The followings are the users whom she follows. A content unit published on Twitter is called tweet. A tweet cited by someone else is called a retweet. Category assignments or tags are marked with a number sign   . In context of Twitter those are called hashtags.  Question and answer platforms are platforms where users can pose questions and everyone can answer them. Answers can be rated by other users. Examples for question and answer platforms are Yahoo! Answers,16 Gutefrage.net,17 Ask,18 and Blurtit.19  Rating and review platforms allow users to rate and comment on products or services  e.g., Qype,20 Ciao,21 Tripadvisor22 . There are rating and review platforms that are completely user-generated and there are commercial platforms that integrate user-generated content  e.g., Amazon23 . Ratings are opinions that can be contributed by just one click on a given scale. The scale can be binary  e.g., thumbs up , or it can have more levels  e.g., x out of n stars . Reviews are written texts about products, services or experiences. Usually, platforms allow both, ratings and reviews.  Social networks are platforms that allow individuals to create a proﬁle and articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection. Users can view and traverse their connections  Boyd & Ellison, 2008 . Examples for social networks are Myspace,24 Face-  16http:  answers.yahoo.com 17http:  www.gutefrage.net 18http:  ask.com 19http:  www.blurtit.com 20http:  www.qype.com 21http:  www.ciao.com 22http:  www.tripadvisor.com 23http:  www.amazon.com 24http:  www.myspace.com   2.2 The Value of User-Generated Content  25  book,25 LinkedIn,26 Google+,27 and Xing.28 Social networks support feeds consisting of updates, which are similar to mircoblog posts. The circle of people updates are published to, diﬀers gradually from public to personal. In some social networks, relationships are mutual relations, in others they can be unidirectional as it is in Google+. The social network Facebook has 1.15 billion monthly active users as of June 2013  Facebook, 2013 .  2.2 The Value of User-Generated Content  The possibility to make content publicly available is a major achieve- ment in human history that enables intellectual development and progress. The possibility for everyone to contribute content to the public is accompanied by new chances as well as challenges. To grasp the full potential of social media, values as well as challenges need to be understood.  2.2.1 A Short History of Publication  Before the invention of writing, information could be spread by word- of-mouth only, with all the accompanying limitations. Publication began after the monopoly of letters, mostly held by a priestly caste, had been broken. Scripts of various kinds came to use, but book production was conﬁned largely by religious centers of learning. The invention of printing transformed the possibilities of the written word. Printing has been ﬁrst invented in China in the 6th century A.D., but it was not passed on to Europe. In Europe the invention of printing is attributed to Gutenberg about 1440–1450. His achievements involved movable metal type, paper, ink, and press. In less than 50 years print-  25http:  www.facebook.com 26http:  www.linkedin.com 27https:  plus.google.com 28http:  www.xing.com   26  2 User-Generated Content  ing was carried out from Germany to Europe. The possibilities for mass-producing written matter soon became evident. Additionally, around the turn of the century literacy began to spread beyond the clergy. Every kind of attempt was made to regulate such a “danger- ous” new mode of communication  Encyclopædia Britannica, 2007, p. 416 . After three centuries of struggle around freedom of the press, by the end of the 18th century a large measure of freedom of press has been achieved in western Europe and in North America and a wide range of printed matter was in circulation. The mechanization of printing and increasing literacy brought the printed word to its powerful position as means of inﬂuencing people and, hence, societ- ies. By the 19th century, publishing became a distinct occupation. Selecting, editing, designing the material, arranging its production and distribution and bearing the ﬁnancial risk became functions pe- culiar to a publisher.  Encyclopædia Britannica, 2007   In the early 20th century the technical requirements for electronic dissemination of audio and video information were developed. At the beginning of the 20th century radio and in the middle of the 20th century television became important media to broadcast information.  Encyclopædia Britannica, 2013a   The development of the World Wide Web began in 1989. Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues at CERN created the HyperText Transfer Protocol and released the ﬁrst Web browser in 1992. By the mid-1990s the World Wide Web had millions of active users  En- cyclopædia Britannica, 2013c . With the World Wide Web it became possible to spread information via the Internet. Making information publicly available was no longer a monopoly of printing. To publish content via the Internet instead of a publisher a specialist was needed who had the technical knowledge how to make the content available online.  The ﬁrst form of social media emerged with the creation of the USENET in 1979  Encyclopædia Britannica, 2013b . The USENET, in full User’s Network, is an Internet-based network of discussion   2.2 The Value of User-Generated Content  27  In the 2000s social media emerged as a signiﬁcant phe- groups. nomenon. It transforms the possibilities of communication. To spread information, neither a publisher nor a specialist is needed anymore. Information can be spread by everyone. The amount of information publicly available has increased drastically. This goes hand in hand with the progress of mobile devices that are equipped with photo and video capabilities while providing mobile access to the Internet.  The number of people who are able to publish content has increased. The possibilities to publish have been simpliﬁed. And the creation of content has been facilitated as well. Since a publisher is no longer needed to make content publicly available, the selection of content falls to the user. The publisher’s ﬁltering of the content with regards to quality is omitted. Consequently, there is a huge amount of inform- ation. It is the user’s task now to select and evaluate it. This is a new challenge for users, which requires new competences and means.  2.2.2 Social Media Becomes a News Source  Content created and contributed by users can be of high value. Due to smart phones29 and the number of users contributing content, news can spread faster around the world than through any other media. In January 2009 US Airways ﬂight 1549 made an emergency landing on the Hudson River. It was an accident in a metropolitan area during daylight hours. The news about the accident were spread by eyewitnesses via social media. The ﬁrst Twitter message about the plane crash came from Hanrahan  2009  a few minutes after the plane went down: “I just watched a plane crash into the hudson rive in manhattan.” Figure 2.3 shows a picture of the plane taken with a mobile phone camera and made publicly available via Twitter.  29The key features of smart phones relevant here are mobile Internet access, photo  and video camera.   28  2 User-Generated Content  Figure 2.3: Picture of US Airways ﬂight 1549 taken with a mo-  bile device and shared on Twitter. Krums  2009  took this picture of the US Airways plane that ditched on the Hudson River 15 January, 2009 and shared it via Twitter shortly after the plane came down.   2.2 The Value of User-Generated Content  29  The ﬁrst report about the event on television was aired 30 minutes after the crash by CNN  2009 . This example illustrates that via social media information can be spread faster than via newspapers, television or radio.  2.2.3 Social Media Empowers Civil Movements  In social media there is no central institution that selects the events that become news. The users who view and share information on so- cial media platforms decide whether an event is breaking news. News agencies and editorial departments decide what is delivered as news in television, radio and newspapers. This selection inﬂuences the re- cipients’ view of the world. In countries where there are restraints upon freedom of speech and of the press, ﬁltering of information by the government is an instrument to manipulate its citizens. Social media plays a decisive role in democracy movements in countries with censored press and a lack of freedom of speech.  The Arab Spring was a wave of protests against authoritarian regimes in the Middle East and North Africa in 2010 and 2011. In all Arab countries the press was under censorship.30 Some journalists paid with their lives for their views  Khazen, 1999 . Social media played an essential role in the Arab Spring.  In Tunisia, the ﬁrst protests were catalyzed when Mohamed Bouazizi—a 26-year-old street vendor—immolated himself on Decem- ber 17, 2010 in Sidi Bouzid, protesting his treatment by local oﬃ- cials. The terrestrial TV stations were strictly state controlled and did not report on the events in Sidi Bouzid. A video was taken by eyewitnesses who were ﬁlming with their mobile phones. One of them subsequently uploaded the material of the self-immolation to his public Facebook account. Through Facebook the material was accessible to Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based satellite TV station, which  30This included Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Bahrain, Qatar, Tunisia   Khazen, 1999 .   30  2 User-Generated Content  broadcast the news on this event via Satellite TV. In the course of the evolving uprising, citizens on-site continued to take photos and videos of the demonstrations with mobile phones and uploaded them to the Internet. Through Facebook a signiﬁcant amount of activ- ists informed people outside Sidi Bouzid about what was happening in the town. These country-wide social networks spread the news about the ongoing political activities in Sidi Bouzid to other cities in Tunisia. In other Tunisian cities  e.g., Reguets, Kasserine, Taba, and Sfax  demonstrations followed soon. The organizers of local demon- strations used Facebook to develop and communicate their strategies, such as where to gather or where to build barricades overnight. The ﬁrst demonstration with a nationwide call for participation in Tunis was organized mainly via Facebook  Wulf, Misaki, Atam, Randall & Rohde, 2013 .  Egypt was governed by the authoritarian regime of Hosni Mubarak from 1981 to 2011. During this time emergency law was in eﬀect. The emergency law allowed prosecutors to detain any citizen for up to 30 days without charges  Moustafa, 2003 . Egyptians suﬀered poverty, corruption and political repression. In the Egyptian revolu- tion social media also played a key role for pro-democracy protesters  Preston, 2011 . In June 2010, Khaled Said—a young Egyptian—was pulled from an Internet cafe in Alexandria by the police. He was then beaten to death by the police in the lobby of a residential building. The Egyptian Ghonim  2012  created a Facebook page “We Are All Khaled Said”. Pictures taken with a mobile phone from the morgue of Said’s battered and bloodied face were posted there. Within a week 130,000 people joined the page and shared updates about the case. The Facebook page was used to post invitations to street protests and silent protests in Alexandria and Cairo. Video-enabled cell phones shed light on the injustices and cruelties of the government’s prac- tices that would have happened in the dark without public notice otherwise. The Facebook page provided a possibility for people to connect with each other. It oﬀered Egyptians a forum to bond over their outrage about the government’s abuses. The Facebook page   2.2 The Value of User-Generated Content  31  “We Are All Khaled Said” helped to ignite the uprising that led to the protests that forced President Hosni Mubarak from power in 2011  Vargas, 2012 .  Cases of human-rights violations exposed and made public by citizens are reported from many countries. There are videos on Youtube calling attention to cotton-growers’ working conditions in Uzbekistan, mining practices in the Philippines, human-organ harvesting in China, the persecution of Bahai’s in Iran and Malaysian police practices and many more crimes against humanity  Diamond, 2010 .  2.2.4 Social Media Facilitates Ethical Consumerism  Also in democratically reigned countries there are grievances that do not have a lobby among traditional media  i.e., print, television and radio  authorities, but which do concern people as citizens and also as consumers.  Social media enables people to disseminate information about such is- sues. Examples for areas of concern are nature protection and animal welfare  e.g., environmental reporting, nuclear power, climate change, pollution, animal testing, factory farming , economic issues  e.g., sup- ply chain policy, marketing, product sustainability , and political is- sues such as armaments and anti-social ﬁnance. Consumers’ attempts to persuade companies to sustainable and responsible behavior with the help of their collective consuming behavior is called ethical con- sumerism.  An example from Kenya illustrates the impact of ethical consumer- ism. In Kenya, women working conditions in the cut ﬂower industry improved with the country’s success in supplying European markets  Hale & Opondo, 2005 . When Kenya started to supply European markets, it brought increased attention to the industry’s social and environmental impacts. Driven by the various concerns of consumers, retailers, auctions, European regulators and civil society organiza- tions, ﬂower growers have to comply with a number of codes of con-   32  2 User-Generated Content  duct. Due to these codes Kenya’s cut ﬂower industry evolved as one of the most codiﬁed agricultural sectors in the world  Opondo, 2013 . Codes of conduct were initially introduced to satisfy consumers and retailers in the European markets, but they have led to a noteworthy improvement of working conditions on the ﬂower farms and pack- houses  Opondo, 2013 .  Consumers’ boycotts of products and companies due to ethical reas- ons have a long history  Irving, Harrison & Rayner, 2002 . The positive counterpart is called buycott or carrotmob  Neilson, 2010 . Consumers share their knowledge about responsible businesses and purchase their goods in order to reward socially responsible behavior  Hoﬀmann & Hutter, 2012 . With the help of social media ethical consumerism can gain impact. It facilitates the exposition and dis- tribution of malpractice as well as responsible behavior and helps consumers to organize and coordinate boycotts as well as buycotts.  2.2.5 Social Media Supports Word-of-Mouth  Information about products or services provided by the producer or retailer of the product is biased due to the producer’s or retailer’s interest to sell it. Information provided by consumers for consumers is called word-of-mouth. For consumers, word-of-mouth is an al- ternative source of information about products. Product information provided by other consumers who are free of commercial interests are considered to be less biased and hence more truthful. They are considered to be a valuable source of information for users in their decision making process  Lelis & Howes, 2011 .  User-generated content by consumers about products or services are the online version of traditional word-of-mouth. Users share their product experiences and opinions with others on social media plat- forms. Product experiences and opinions can be found in all types of social media platforms, such as blogs, forums and social networks, but rating and review platforms are especially dedicated to this purpose.   2.2 The Value of User-Generated Content  33  They help customers ﬁnd products matching their needs  Chen & Xie, 2008 . Studies show that user recommendations from social media in- ﬂuence purchase decisions  Reichelt, 2013 . In some circumstances consumer trust online word-of-mouth sources even more than inform- ation from people known in person  P¨oyry, Parvinen, Salo, Blakaj & Tiainen, 2011 .  Although ratings and reviews can be a valuable source of unbiased information, there are also companies, which try to counterfeit so- cial media recommendations. Users are sensitive to such manipula- tions. In 2010 the CEO of the company WeTab Helmut Hoﬀer von Ankershoﬀen pretended to be a consumer and wrote very positive product reviews about his own company’s product as “Peter Glaser” on Amazon. The fake was revealed and followed by an outrage of potential customers. Figure 2.4 shows screen-shots of the review and the user’s proﬁle revealing that the author of the reviews actually is the CEO of the producing company. Helmut Hoﬀer von Ankershoﬀen resigned due to this scandal  DPA, 2010 .  Thus, the manipulation of customer reviews is not trivial and can have serious consequences. Nevertheless, there are counterfeit re- views. Not all of them can be revealed at ﬁrst sight. Some can only be detected by experienced users, others not at all. Online word- of-mouth is generated in unprecedented volume and at great speed  Zhang, Guo & Goes, 2013 . Among several negative reviews a false positive review is often suspicious but carries no signiﬁcant weight.  The possibility to share information about products and services with other users on rating and review platforms enlarges the circle of people experiences can be shared with. Formerly, people shared their experiences with people known in person. Nowadays, experiences can be shared online with everyone who is interested. Consequently, positive as well as negative information about products and services can spread faster and wider. Online word-of-mouth is an additional source of information that makes users independent from producers’ or retailers’ information about their products and services.   34  2 User-Generated Content   cid:1    cid:2   Figure 2.4: Example of a failed attempt to counterfeit a user  recommendation. a: WeTab CEO Helmut Hoﬀer von Ankershoﬀen wrote pos- itive product reviews on his own product pretending to be Peter Glaser. b: His Amazon wish list showed his true identity and re- vealed the deceit. Screen-shots from Spiegel  2010 .   2.2 The Value of User-Generated Content  35  2.2.6 Social Media Extends Market Research  Experiences and opinions published by customers are also of value for market research. Analyzing user opinions in social media to under- stand customers is the core goal of Social Media Monitoring. Social Media Monitoring analyses user-generated content over a given time period with regard to relevant marketing information, such as brand image, trends, customer preferences, or sentiments. Results can help to improve product design and customer support as well as campaign development and public relation activities.  There are several companies on the market that oﬀer Social Media Monitoring. Examples are Attensity,31 BIG,32 Visible,33 Nielsen,34 and Radian6.35 Capabilities of these companies are diverse. Usually, the content is analyzed with basic text mining technologies. Results are combined with statistics from collected metadata. Metadata used for this purpose is limited to the information provided over all social media categories; such are source, date of contribution and the nick- name of the author. Typical statistics are the number of mentions of predeﬁned keywords such as brand names.36 It can be further analyzed by time, source and authors. Further information, such as peer ratings, how long the author has been part of the community, or how often the contribution has been read is usually either manually analyzed or not taken into account.  2.2.7 Intentions Determine the Value of Social Media  The possibility for users to publish content to other users without the barriers publishing in print once had, has great impact on the  31http:  www.attensity.com 32http:  www.big-social-media.com 33http:  www.visibletechnologies.com  34http:  nmincite.com  35http:  www.salesforcemarketingcloud.com 36This is commonly referred to as Share of Voice.   36  2 User-Generated Content  individual, on society and economy. The values of social media are manifold. Social media becomes an alternative source for independ- ent and unﬁltered news. It empowers people to expose wrongdoing, report news, express resentment and mobilize protest against griev- ances. Social media enables committed consumers to broadcast in- formation about responsible businesses and disseminate information about irresponsible behavior to adapt their consumption according to their ethical beliefs. Online word-of-mouth has become an altern- ative source of information for products and services and makes the consumer more independent of potentially false marketing promises.  Social media can expand political, social and economic freedom  Dia- mond, 2010 . Of course, the power of social media can also be ex- ploited and misused. The positive eﬀects illustrated in the previous sections presupposes good intentions. Social media provides the pos- sibility to spread the word and organize to do good, but—as any other media—it can also be utilized for the opposite. And, even if in- tentions are noble, people who are not well-informed or manipulated by wrong or misleading information can do harm despite of good intentions.  2.3 Users’ Strategies to Interpret Metadata  Today  100 hours of video are uploaded to Youtube every minute and 6 billion hours of video are watched each month on YouTube  Youtube, 2013 . In 2011, Flickr—a media sharing platform for photos—announced the 6 billionth photo uploaded to their platform  Kremerskothen, 2011 . The microblogging platform Twitter has over 200 million active users creating over 400 million Tweets each day  Wickre, 2013 . The blog platform Tumblr37 hosts 132.2 million blogs with 58.4 billion entries  Tumblr, 2013a .  37http:  www.tumblr.com   2.3 Users’ Strategies to Interpret Metadata Today  37  To tap the full potential of social media, values as well as challenges need to be understood. The massive amount of information contrib- uted is one of the biggest challenges for the user.  The main challenge posed by user-generated content is that the dis- tribution of quality has high variance  Agichtein et al., 2008 . The quality varies from excellent to worthless and abusive.  Users are confronted with the challenge to ﬁnd, evaluate and classify content. Additional information can help the user to cope with this challenge. User-generated content is accompanied by various and diﬀering information about its content.  For example, a tweet is accompanied by information about when it has been contributed, how many people have already shared the tweet, how many people liked the tweet and who contributed it. A forum entry shows when it has been contributed and the nickname of the contributor. With several navigational steps, the user can learn how many other entries have been created in a discussion, how many times a discussion has been viewed and how many active members belong to a forum’s community.  To the user the metadata is initially a number she needs to inter- pret. Let us assume, a user tries to decide, whether a speciﬁc video she found on Youtube is popular. The video displays a number of 100 views. The question, whether a video is popular, can be answered in comparison to other videos’ number of views. Hence, knowledge about the range of numbers of views for other videos makes the in- formation about how many times a speciﬁc video has been viewed more valuable. To gain this knowledge, the user has to manually search for other numbers to compare with. An experienced user may have already seen a lot of other videos. She might have gained a feeling for how many views are a few, average, or a lot. But if she did not keep record of how many times other videos have been watched, her judgment can not be more than a gut feeling. And even if— hypothetically—she kept record of the number of views of the videos she has already watched; it would still not be representative. Further-   38  2 User-Generated Content  more, not all information that might help to evaluate the value of a contribution can be assessed on the same page where the content is displayed. Some information can be found on authors’ proﬁles, some by following other links provided. For some information the user even has to navigate back to other sites. It requires the knowledge where the information is displayed to be able to acquire it. To get the num- ber of views of a discussion in a forum for example, the user has to navigate to a higher level in the hierarchy of the forum.  This mechanism applies to virtually all metadata provided for user- generated content. Users cope with answering questions, such as: Is a four out of ﬁve stars very good or just average for a hotel review? Is 15 likes a positive indication for the piece of content? Do twenty check-ins indicate a recommendable restaurant?  Another possibility to ﬁlter user-generated content is via social con- nections. That is, users browse through user-generated content that has been selected and shared by their social circles. Social circles ex- ist in social media platforms which allow users to create a proﬁle and connect with other users they know. Users receive those messages that have been shared by the people they are connected with. Social networks are an example. But there are other social media platforms that allow to connect with other people as well. Microblogging ser- vices also work that way. Users decide whom they follow. The feeds displayed to a user by Twitter are determined by the followed users. Messages are distributed via people who are connected. This mech- anism can be described as social ﬁltering. Messages are ﬁltered by the social connections the user has established.  Social ﬁltering has advantages as well as disadvantages. It is eﬀect- ive in reducing the amount of information. But, a message is only delivered to a user if and only if his connections have received the message and shared it. This means, the user can only hope that “If the news is that important, it will ﬁnd me.”38  Stelter, 2008 . There  38The New York Times dedicated an article to the question how young people ﬁnd political news online. Originally, the quote is from a college student   2.3 Users’ Strategies to Interpret Metadata Today  39  is no possibility to perform a dedicated search for generally well dis- tributed messages. The kind of messages a user receives and how fast it reaches him, depends on the quality and amount of his social con- nections. A user who is not well connected is more likely to miss out on well distributed messages than a user who is well connected. The inﬂuence the user has on this is limited and depends on his ability to connect with others. Users, who do not have many friends in social networks, such as Facebook, users, who don’t know who to follow on Twitter or on Google+ are excluded from the information ﬂow. They can not proﬁt from social ﬁltering.  edges e   cid:2   Furthermore, some platforms have their own rankings. Facebook for example, ranks the content displayed on the user-speciﬁc feeds based on the user’s individual connections to other users. Although the ranking is not completely transparent to the user, Facebook engineers Sanghvi & Steinberg gave some insights about the Facebook News Feed Algorithm at a Facebook developer conference. The Facebook ue ∗we ∗de. query-independent feed rank is called EdgeRank: Here, ue is the aﬃnity score between viewing user and edge creator, we is a weight for the edge type  e.g., create, comment, like, tag  and de is the time decay factor based on how long ago the edge was created. The aﬃnity score resembles the relation between a viewing user and the item’s creator. It is higher if the bound between the two is tighter. The bounds become tighter when messages are exchanged or the viewer visits the creator’s Facebook proﬁle often. Edge types are given a weight. A comment is considered more important than a like. Hence, it gets a higher weight. The time decay takes the as- sumption into account that the older an edge, the less important it becomes. These factors are multiplied for each edge. All edge scores of a contribution are added up to its EdgeRank. Only ﬁrst degree edges are used in this algorithm. The EdgeRank is based on the rela- tions between users, other users’ reactions to the entry and recency.  who described the way she receives news online in a research focus group. It illustrates an attitude towards searching of a person who is used to and inﬂuenced by the use of social ﬁltering.   40  2 User-Generated Content  Consequently, each content unit is ranked diﬀerently depending on the viewing user. Furthermore, it only ranks content shared with already established social connections on the speciﬁc platform.  To summarize, metadata helps users to evaluate content. It gradu- ally becomes more helpful with more knowledge about the range and distribution of their values. The user has to acquire this knowledge through manual research. There is no tool that assists the user with this challenge so far. To tap the full potential of social media, values as well as challenges need to be understood and possibilities to cope with the challenges have to be developed. This work aims at support- ing users with the task of evaluation of user-generated contents and the interpretation of its metadata.  2.4 Existing Approaches Lack Cross-Platform  Compatibility  The following section explains the advantages and challenges of a ranking approach for user-generated content that is compat- ible with diﬀerent social media platforms. Furthermore, existing query-independent ranking approaches for user-generated content are presented and their applicability to user-generated content from dif- ferent platforms is discussed.  Cross-platform compatibility has several advantages. A ranking ap- proach is cross-platform compatible, if the ranking approach is ap- plicable to content units from diﬀerent platforms. An advantage of a cross-platform compatible ranking approach is that two content units are comparable by their ranking. If content units are comparable by ranking, an order can be established across content units from diﬀer- ent platforms.  This allows to apply the approach to a search engine that delivers content from more than one platform. A ranking approach which is limited to a speciﬁc platform would only be applicable in a search   2.4 Existing Approaches Lack Cross-Platform Compatibility  41  engine that delivers content from the platform the ranking has been designed for.  Furthermore, a platform-speciﬁc approach would only allow to com- pare results from user-generated content units from the same plat- form.  A cross-platform compatible approach on the contrary, does not limit the user to ﬁndings such as “the best scoring  e.g., most popular  video from Youtube” and “the best scoring  e.g., most popular  video from Vimeo.”39 With a cross-platform compatible approach it is pos- sible to determine which is the best scoring content unit independent of its origin.  Furthermore, an approach that is applicable to diﬀerent platforms and not dependent on platform speciﬁcs is more likely to be applicable to changes in the platform speciﬁcs and even to new platforms.  Query-dependent ranking approaches rank documents by their texts’ correspondence with the query. Query-dependent ranking approaches are therefore per se compatible with diﬀerent platforms as long as the ranked documents contain text.  Query-independent ranking approaches however exploit other char- acteristics of the ranked objects. A query-independent ranking ap- proach for user-generated content that is cross-platform compatible is therefore accompanied by challenges. The characteristics that are most valuable for the evaluation of user-generated content—its metadata—varies with diﬀerent platforms.  Existing ranking approaches can be divided into approaches that are compatible with diﬀerent platforms but are query-dependent and ap- proaches that are query-independent but platform-speciﬁc.  Platform-speciﬁc approaches rank user-generated content based on the features speciﬁc to a social media category. Those approaches are  39Vimeo  https:  vimeo.com   is a media sharing platform for videos, similar to  Youtube.   42  2 User-Generated Content  not applicable to platforms that lack those speciﬁc features. Wanas et al. for example, developed a ranking speciﬁcally for forums. A peculiarity of forums is their hierarchical structure. Information is distributed among several hierarchical levels. In forums within a thread, postings often relate to each other giving the whole thread a discussion-like character. These characteristics raise some speciﬁc questions, such as how to handle hierarchical information, or how the content should be analyzed. A thread could be analyzed per content unit neglecting the context. Alternatively, analysis could be thread-wise. This alternative raises the question of how to handle content unit related metadata. Wanas et al. address these ques- tions and propose a set of features speciﬁcally to analyze forums. The feature set is based on a forum’s hierarchical structure. They introduce “OnSubForumTopic” and “OnThreadForumTopic.” “On- SubForumTopic” refers to the degree a post has remained relevant to the sub-forum it resides in. This is done by creating a bag of words from the combination of all the words in the sub-forum and then com- paring the most frequent 10 percent of them to the words occurring in each post’s body and title. Given that the ﬁrst posting of a thread and its title determine the topic of a thread, “OnThreadTopic” de- scribes the relevance of a post to the discussion it occurs in. This is done analogically to “OnSubForumTopic” by comparing each post- ing’s bag of words to the bag of words of the leading post.  Wanas et al., 2008   Moturu proposes an approach to quantify trustworthiness of social media content. The research is focused on shared health using con- tent from Wikipedia and Daily Strength. The forum Moturu analyses allows members to connect with each other as friends. This is not a common feature for forums. In contrast to social networks, get- ting connected is not necessary to discuss topics with other members. Hence, the average user has fewer connections than the average social network member does. Moturu proposes author social connectedness as a feature to quantify trustworthiness. Social connectedness is ex- pressed by the average number of friends for each friend the author   2.4 Existing Approaches Lack Cross-Platform Compatibility  43  is connected with. This feature can only be applied to social media platforms that allow its users to connect with each other.  Moturu, 2010   The average number of answers with references is a signiﬁcant fea- ture for quality of the question in question and answer platforms  Agichtein et al., 2008 . This is only applicable to question and an- swer platforms, but not other kind of social media platforms. Blogs for example lack the question and answers structure.  Although there is no query-independent ranking approach that is applicable to all kinds of social media platforms, there are features that are transferable to other platforms. Features gained by text an- alysis are applicable to all user-generated content units that contain text.  Text length is an example for a commonly used feature  e.g., Moturu, 2010; Wanas et al., 2008 . Text length, measured by word count, is available for every text and easy to determine. But interpretations diﬀer. Wanas et al.  2008  give credit to postings that are close to the average posting length of the forum, whereas other works give credit to longer texts. The intention in rewarding average length is to value contributions that conform to the length of postings the community accepts as normal. It has to be questioned, whether the average length of a posting indeed reﬂects the posting length the community accepts as normal. Usually, in a forum every posting contributed is published, whether it is accepted by the community or not. A major part of the forum’s contributions could consist of contributions that are considered as “too short” or “too long.” These would still be posted. There is no community acceptance ﬁlter. Consequently, the average length of a posting is independent of the length of postings the community accepts. Works that give credit to longer texts, as- sume that the longer a contributions is, the more earnestness can be insinuated  e.g., Moturu, 2010; Hu, Lim, Sun, Lauw & Vuong, 2007 .  Links within the text of a user-generated content unit can help to ascertain the source of information and indicate utility as they point   44  2 User-Generated Content  to additional sources of information that can help the user  Moturu, 2010; Elgersma & de Rijke, 2008 .  Agichtein et al.  2008  introduce a classiﬁcation framework to auto- matically identify high-quality social media content for question and answer platforms. The task of identifying high-quality content is handled as binary classiﬁcation problem. Their goal is to separate high-quality content from the rest. Questions and answers are ana- lyzed separately. The results were measured against a quality cat- egorization done by humans.  Agichtein et al. take user relationships and metadata into account. In question and answer platforms users actively participate in the reg- ulation of the system by rating interesting questions and voting for good answers. They tested diﬀerent features for their performance in indicating high quality content. They used indicators from punc- tuation and typos  ignorance of capitalization, particularly repeated ellipsis and question marks, irregular spacing, misspellings, out-of- vocabulary words , syntactic and semantic complexity  average num- ber of syllables per word, readability measures , and grammaticality  e.g., part-of-speech tagging and categorizing syntactic patterns as more or less correct,40 the distance between its language model and a given language model  as text derived features  Agichtein et al., 2008, p. 186 . Those text derived features could be applied to other texts as well. The resulting values for precision and recall reveal that direct and indirect peer-ratings as well as text length are among the most signiﬁcant features  Agichtein et al., 2008 . In the case of the evaluated question and answer platform direct peer-ratings are num- ber of stars, number of thumbs up and number of best answer. The number of clicks on the question thread, normalized by the average number of clicks for all questions in its category is an example for indirect ratings.  40The sequence “when—how—why to  verb ” as in “how to identify. . . ” is typical for lower-quality questions, whereas the sequence “when—how—why  verb   personal pronoun   verb ” as in “how do I remove. . . ” is more typical for correctly-formed content.   2.4 Existing Approaches Lack Cross-Platform Compatibility  45  These examples of research that address automated analysis of user- generated content shall illustrate that existing research for automated rating and ranking of user-generated content focuses on platform- speciﬁc approaches.  Nevertheless, this research contributes insights for the interpretation of the applied metrics and their interpretations as exempliﬁed in the previous paragraphs.   3 Metadata in User-Generated  Content  Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure; Like doth quit like, and Measure still for Measure.  William Shakespeare, Measure for Measure, 1623  As introduced in Subsection 2.1.1, user-generated content units con- sist of core data and metadata. Core data is the content itself. The content can be text, audio ﬁles, pictures, videos or a combination of these. Metadata is information about information. In the context of user-generated content metadata is further information about the content, such as the date of publication or the author of the content.  Users are willing to contribute content as well as metadata on on- line platforms that allow them to do so  Mika, 2007 . Diﬀerent platforms allow their users to contribute diﬀerent kinds of metadata. Consequently, user-generated content from diﬀerent platforms have heterogeneous metadata.  The analysis of metadata for all social media categories is the basis for further insights about the structural nature of user-generated con- tent. To do so it is necessary to collect all features provided by diﬀerent social media platforms. User-generated content units from diﬀerent platforms are analyzed. For each category up to 6 repres-  C.

The number of representatives chosen per category depends on how diverse a category’s representatives are. If all platforms of a category provide the same information, one example already suﬃces to show what kind of information is provided by plat- forms belonging to that category. If there are diﬀerences between platforms belonging to the same category, more examples are presen- ted to illustrate the diﬀerences.  The following chapter starts with a summary of the analysis of metadata for each category. The second section of this chapter intro- duces the structural types of metadata that can be observed through- out the categories. The third section introduces a semantic pattern for the metadata of user-generated content. The pattern applies to user-generated content from all categories and is independent of the platform. This is the basis for the modeling of a ranking that works category-independent. A full list of features provided by the social media platforms analyzed can be found in the Appendix.  3.1 Analysis of Metadata for User-Generated  Content  This section summarizes the analysis of metadata for user-generated content for each category. It is the basis for further analysis and modeling presented in the subsequent chapters.  3.1.1 Blogs  User-generated content units from blogs are blog posts. The tradi- tional blog is written by one single person and blog posts are displayed in reverse chronological order showing the most recent entry on top of the page. Today, blogs occur in many diﬀerent varieties. They range from personal diaries to professional journalists’ and multi-authored blogs.   3.1 Analysis of Metadata for User-Generated Content  49  Whether a blog is single-authored or multi-authored, a single posting always has one author, a publishing date and a source. The source is the blog it was published in. Other than those three, there are no further measures that are standard in blogs. But there is a multitude of useful measures that occur in some blogs. Often found in blogs is a feature that allows readers to comment on blog posts. Every comment shows that the blog entry has been worth a user’s time to write the comment. The number of comments on a blog entry indicates that the entry has been noticed. Some blogs also count and display the number of views per entry.  Similar to back-links that are references from other Web sites to the blog, track-backs refer to references from other Web sites to a spe- ciﬁc posting. The number of track-backs indicates how many others regarded a posting as interesting or useful. Track-backs can only be applied for user-generated content units that have a distinct URL.  The reverse chronological order in which blog posts are displayed could imply that for blogs most recent entries are also the most rel- evant. But this cannot be generally assumed. There are also blogs about topics that are not dependent on time. Blogs tend to evolve around special topics its authors are interested in and have gathered some expertise in  Macdonald et al., 2010 . There are blogs about current events, new products or recent experiences for which the most recent entry indeed tends to be also the most interesting. Blog entries that discuss general ideas or giving advice on problems are less de- pendent on time. Also, blogs about personal interests, such as pho- tography or literature, are like collections in character. In collec- tions the most recent entry can be as interesting as any other entry. Therefore blogs are often alternatively structured with categories and tags. An example is Wordpress, an open source blogging tool. Word- press provides tags and categories to group related posts  WordPress, 2013 .  For a single-authored blog the rating of the blog is equal to the rating of the author. For a multi-authored blog this is not the case. To   50  3 Metadata in User-Generated Content  Figure 3.1: Example for a blog post with a plugin from another  platform. The screen-shot shows a blog post with an integrated Flattr button at the bottom  Peter, 2013 . The post has been ﬂattred six times, which means that the author of the post receives small amounts of money from six of his readers, who enjoyed the text. The text of the blog post has been shortened and masked to guide the reader’s attention.  automatically decide whether a blog is single- or multi-authored is not trivial and can also change over time. Since a posting has a single author and a single source, the information about the author and about the source can be allocated separately to the posting. Thus, postings from single- or multi-authored blogs can be treated alike.  There are approaches that rank blogs. They can be classiﬁed as either link-based or feature-driven. They rank whole blogs, not single post- ings. Therefore, they cannot be directly integrated into the ranking of a content unit. The number of back-links—the number of times   3.1 Analysis of Metadata for User-Generated Content  51  Figure 3.2: Example for a blog post with several plugins from  other platforms. The screen-shot shows a blog post with plugins  from left to right  from Twitter, Facebook’s like, Reddit, Email, Google+, share on Facebook, send to StumbleUpon, Fark It!, Share on LinkedIn, and more sharing options in the box at the bottom  Beadon, 2013 . The text of the blog post has been shortened and masked to guide the reader’s attention.   52  3 Metadata in User-Generated Content  a blog is referenced—is an example for a simple ranking feature for a whole blog. Link-based blog ranking approaches estimate the relev- ance of a blog by the number other blogs that link to it. The relevance of a source can be applied to predict the probability for a piece of content published within that platform to be relevant as well.  Some blogs integrate other social media applications as plugins. These plugins can be clicked and have a certain meaning. A click on a Twitter button means that the post is shared on Twitter. A Facebook button means that the post is shared on Facebook. A Face- book like button means that the expresses his approval of the text without sharing it. A Flattr1 button means that the reader of the post donates a small amount of money to the author. Figure 3.1 shows an example of a ﬂattred blog post. Figure 3.2 shows an ex- ample of a blog that includes various plugins. They allow to like a content unit or to share it on social networks. This is also a way to crowd-source relevance.  The following are examples for other social media applications that are currently often used in blogs:   Flattr2    Twitter   Facebook  e.g., share & like    Google+3   Stumble4   InShare5   Reddit6  1Flattr is a microdonation provider  http:  flattr.com  . 2http:  flattr.com  3http:  www.google.com intl en +1 button 4http:  www.stumbleupon.com  5http:  de.linkedin.com  6http:  www.reddit.com    3.1 Analysis of Metadata for User-Generated Content  53  Each click on a plugin button means that a user consumed the post— at least partly—and rewarded the post with an interaction. The pos- sible interactions can have diﬀerent semantics that express a higher or lower level of involvement, but they are all human selected re- commendations. Human recommendations are a useful source of in- formation for others when they try to select content for their own consumption.  As texts in general, the text of a blog-post can be analyzed with regards to text length, frequency and use of speciﬁc words, number of references within the text, and so on.  3.1.2 Forums  A peculiarity of forums is their discussion-like character. This is what makes them so valuable for topics that need debate. But that also often leads to oﬀ-topic discussions that make it diﬃcult to ﬁnd the desired content units.  Forums tend to evolve around speciﬁc ﬁelds of interest. Forums are particularly valuable for users who seek like minded people, specialists in a ﬁeld of interest or information about speciﬁc topics. Specialists share their knowledge in their ﬁeld of competence. They also write about their experiences with products and brands. In technologically oriented forums for example computers, monitors, and gadgets are In telecommunication forums the best service providers discussed. and mobile devices are disputed. In sports oriented forums users share recommendations about training and their experiences with the latest sports gear. Hence, forums are also a popular source of product information prior to buying  Elsas & Glance, 2010 .  There is a large number of forums with various focus topics online. There are some sources online that provide overviews and statistics for forums, one of which is Big Boards.7 Most forums are based  7http:  www.big-boards.com   54  3 Metadata in User-Generated Content  on either phpBB or vBulletin. PhpBB is an open source software,8 whereas vBulletin has to be licensed.9 These forum solutions only support a ﬁxed order of topics. Organizing threads or postings by any concept of ranking is not common.  Consequently, the user has to orientate himself by reading through the topics and threads. Most forums also oﬀer a text search that delivers matching results without a particular ranking.  It is especially hard to get an overview over all the information avail- able for a posting published in a forum. This is due to the hierarch- ical structure of forums. Measures, that are helpful to estimate the relevance of a posting, are distributed among the diﬀerent levels of a forum’s hierarchical structure. Information such as when a post- ing has been published and by whom it was posted can be found on posting-level as publishing date and author, as Figure 3.3 shows. The number of views and how many answers there are to an initial posting can be found on thread-level as number of replies, as Figure 3.4 shows. The number of threads and postings can be found on topic-level, as Figure 3.5 shows. Information about how many users are active in a forum-community and how many subsequent remarks there are to an initial posting can be found one level above thread level.  A large amount of postings within a topic  or sub-forum  can indicate that a topic is popular. Another reason for a large amount of postings within a topic or sub-forum can also be the way a topic or sub-forum is composed. If for example one sub-forum subsumes all cultural topics, whereas political topics are subdivided into several sub-forums, num- bers are diﬃcult to compare. The inner structure of topics of interest is not mandatory. Sub-forums and topics are organized manually and consequently diﬀer in their organization. The diﬀerence in topic or- ganization can also be interpreted as a bias, intended by a human mind. The resulting bias in the calculation might therefore be still reasonable in the semantics of the forum and therefore still helpful  8http:  www.phpbb.com 9http:  www.vbulletin.com   3.1 Analysis of Metadata for User-Generated Content  55   cid:2  cid:8  cid:9  cid:10  cid:5  cid:7  cid:4  cid:1  cid:6  cid:3  cid:11  cid:3  cid:6   Figure 3.3: Forums’ posting-level.

If for example the above mentioned forum subsumes all cultural topics, whereas political topics are subdivided into several sub-forums, this could likely be a forum that was founded as a polit- ical forum. Consequently, it should indeed have more content within the political sub-forums than in the culture section.  Elsas & Glance  2010  worked on an approach to identify forums with rich product discussion. Their approach is based on a previ- ously known list of products and brands people could search for. To identify relevant discussion within a forum they also worked with the number of postings within a topic. They solved the problem of dif- ferent aggregation levels by ignoring information from higher levels. They assign each thread to the parent forum containing the thread assuming that each message belongs only to the immediate parent forum. Higher-level forums are ignored. On the one hand this solves the problem of comparability of topic sizes. On the other hand it neg- lects potentially useful information on higher levels. Yet, information from diﬀerent levels can be mapped to a single posting. This means that the same posting can be rated higher if it is posted in a higher rated thread, topic or forum, or is written by a higher rated author.  Authors in forums are usually assigned a level of expertise based on the author’s statistics. Forums diﬀer in the number of levels that are assigned  e.g., newbie to expert signifying level 1 to level n . Users who are new to a forum-community are mostly users who search for expertise. They initially become a member to post their questions. In contrast, users who are members for a longer time, are more likely to be interested in the topic of the forum in general. The number of postings published by an author can be interpreted as indicator for expertise presuming that a user who posts more has more expertise to share. The duration of his membership in combination with his activity derived from the date of his last posting gives further allusion to his potential to publish useful content.   3.1 Analysis of Metadata for User-Generated Content  59  3.1.3 Location Sharing and Annotation Platforms  Location sharing and annotation refers to collaboratively produced metadata for virtual representations of physical places. Foursquare,10 Loopt,11 Facebook Places,12 and Google Latitude13 are examples for location sharing and annotation platforms. These applications are rapidly growing. Foursquare has more than 15 million users14 and Facebook places is used by more than 30 million users. Users of Foursquare shared their locations over a 100 million times by July 2010  Cramer et al., 2011, p. 57 .  Location-sharing services have a longer history in research then they are available for consumers. Research activities with focus on loc- ating and tracking people go back to the early 1990s  Pier, 1991; Harper, Lamming & Newman, 1992 . The ﬁrst locator technology was the ActiveBadge, originated at Olivetti Cambridge Research Lab. It was intended for oﬃce application. Badges should be worn in the workplace to track locations of employees. Even at this early point of research sociological and ethical questions were raised and con- sidered important. The questions posed by Pier  1991, p. 285  “Will ’Big Brother’ monitor your every move?” and “Can we architect sys- tems that provide desirable services without actually revealing any individual’s location and trail unless given permission by that indi- vidual?” illustrate farsightedness as well as the core problem with location tracking systems. Most ensuing systems in research have focused on location tracking, while providing the user with diﬀerent levels of control over what is shared with whom, usually a limited audience  Iachello, Smith, Consolvo, Chen & Abowd, 2005; Reilly, Dearman, Ha, Smith & Inkpen, 2006; Barkhuus, Brown, Bell, Sher- wood, Hall & Chalmers, 2008; Scellato, Noulas, Lambiotte & Mascolo, 2011 .  10https:  de.foursquare.com 11http:  www.loopt.com 12https:  www.facebook.com about location 13http:  www.google.com latitude 14https:  foursquare.com about   60  3 Metadata in User-Generated Content  Figure 3.6: Representation of the New York Marriott Marquis Hotel on the location sharing and annotation plat- form Foursquare.

In the proﬁle the user, Daer  2013 , presents information about herself. At the top her name is displayed along with a short text describing herself. This user has performed 6,014 check-ins and given 174 tips, one of which is the New York Marriott Marquis Hotel in Figure 3.6. On the right hand side the number of badges, the user’s level  “Superuser Level 1”  and the number of her mayorships are displayed. At the bottom right the number of friends is provided. This view of this user’s proﬁle is general public as speciﬁed in Section 2.1.1  see also Figure 2.1 on page 15 . It can be ac- cessed without being a member of Foursquare.   62  3 Metadata in User-Generated Content  The question “Can we architect systems that provide desirable ser- vices without actually revealing any individual’s location and trail unless given permission by that individual?”  Pier, 1991, p. 285  already contains the answer to the addressed problem: permission by the individual. The important issue regarding privacy is that the location sharing is performed manually and not via tracking. Cur- rent solutions do not automatically track and share peoples’ location. If desired by the individual user, he can give permission and reveal his location to others. Each publication is enabled and authorized by the user himself. In in-depth interviews Cramer et al.  2011  ob- served a shift from privacy concern driven behavior and data deluge to performative considerations in location sharing.  Check-ins are manually entered to pair user location with semantic- ally enriched venues  e.g., restaurants, grocery stores, bars , which are visible to other users. Figure 3.6 shows an example of the repres- entation of a hotel on the location sharing and annotation platform Foursquare.  The venues are the central reference points in location sharing and annotation. A venue has a name and a geographical location. Fur- thermore, the total number people who have visited a location so far is provided along with the total number of check-ins. Assuming that users rather share places they like with other people, a large number of visitors suggest a high popularity of a location. A high ratio of check-ins per visitor suggests loyal customers. Annotations of loca- tions always have an author and a publishing date. Users can rate the annotations of other users.  Additionally, the location sharing and annotation-user’s proﬁle shows how many total check-ins she published so far and how long she has been active on the platform. Figure 3.7 shows an example of a user’s proﬁle on the location sharing and annotation platform Foursquare.   3.1 Analysis of Metadata for User-Generated Content  63  3.1.4 Media Sharing Platforms  Media sharing platforms are platforms where registered users can upload content and share it with friends or provide it to the public. Existing platforms are specialized on speciﬁc media such as pictures, videos or audio content. Youtube is the most successful platform of our times for video sharing.15 Flickr is an example for a platform where users share pictures.16  Users can connect with other users. Connections can be unidirec- tional as typical for microblogs or mutual. Youtube even supports both types of relationships, namely friends and subscribers. Flickr supports friends as well as groups users can join. Usually, the number of connections is lower than in social networks. This might be due to the fact that in social media sharing platforms users do not have to be connected to see each others content. Users can comment on the content and contribute one-click-opinions.  A user-generated content unit from a social media sharing site usually has a contributor, a publishing date, a number of one-click-opinions, a number of views and a number of comments. Figure 3.8 and Fig- ure 3.9 show examples of content units from two diﬀerent social media sharing platforms.  User proﬁles typically give information about the user’s nickname, the date when the user became member of the community, and the number of content units contributed.  3.1.5 Microblogs  In microblogs the author does not specify a recipient. The reader chooses which authors he would like to read postings from. Every message is public by default and the recipients choose whose messages they read. The follow relation is not mutual.  15http:  www.youtube.com 16http:  www.flickr.com   64  3 Metadata in User-Generated Content  Figure 3.8: A user-generated content unit on the media sharing  platform Youtube. The screen-shot shows an example for a user-generated con- tent unit on Youtube. The platform displays the video in the main area. It shows the title of the video 120715 - PSY - Gangnam style  Comeback stage ... and the contributing user CapsuleHD20  2012 . Furthermore, the number of views and the number of user ratings are displayed. The bottom of the ﬁgure page shows when the video has been contributed. In this example, the contributor is not the artist of the video. The artist—PSY—is explicitly named at the right side of the bottom of the screen-shot.   3.1 Analysis of Metadata for User-Generated Content  65  Figure 3.9: A user-generated content unit on the media sharing  platform Flickr. The screen-shot shows an example for a user-generated con- tent unit on Flickr  Garlesteanu, 2013 . The platform dis- plays the picture in the main area. Below the picture is the title rusty scissor and the nickname of the contributing user Garlesteanu Cosmin. Furthermore, the platform shows that this picture has been given 102 favorites and 27 comments. During the three days since it has been taken, it has been viewed 4,141 times.  Twitter is a typical representative. A tweet has always one distinct au- thor and a publishing date. Favorites are Twitter’s one-click-opinions. Tweets can be further distributed by other users. For Twitter this is called retweet. The number of favorites and the number of retweets are displayed with the content unit. They help users to estimate the importance of a tweet.  The user’s proﬁle information shows how many content units a user contributed, how many followers he has and how many others he follows  i.e., following . The number of followers indicates an author’s reach. The more followers an author has, the more people consider   66   cid:1   3 Metadata in User-Generated Content   cid:2   Figure 3.10: A user-generated content unit and a user’s proﬁle  on Twitter. a: A user-generated content unit published on Twit- ter. Below the text, the number of retweets, the number of favorites, and the date of publication is displayed. Above the text, the author of the user-generated content unit is displayed. b: A user’s proﬁle. The author, Kutcher  2013 , provides a picture and a nickname. He wrote two sentences about himself, reveals where he lives and provides an addi- tional link. The proﬁle shows that this user has contributed 8,070 content units, that he follows 715 other users, and that 15,010,002 users follow him.  his contributions worth reading. If we think about the author and his followers as a directed graph, more conclusions about the value of an author’s followers can be drawn. A user who follows fewer authors could be considered to be more selective about content and to choose more carefully whom he follows. Furthermore, it could be assumed that this user is more likely to really read the postings by those authors. The conclusion can now be drawn that a large number of followers who follow many authors is not as valuable as having the same amount of followers who follow a small number of authors. Figure 3.10 shows an example of a user-generated content unit and a user’s proﬁle from the microblogging platform Twitter. Microblogs diﬀer from traditional blogs in being much shorter and   3.1 Analysis of Metadata for User-Generated Content  67  smaller in ﬁle size. For example, a tweet is limited to 140 characters. It contains text sometimes accompanied by a short-link.17 Therefore, the length of tweets varies only in this small range. A particularity of microblogs is that there are syntax agreements, which can be used within the text. The syntax is not technically imposed by Twitter. It has emerged as conventions from the users’ needs. Category tags could be derived from the text itself as well by parsing for the number sign   . Retweets can easily be parsed, since they are marked within the text message by the letters RT.  3.1.6 Question and Answer Platforms  In question and answer platforms users can pose questions and other users can answer them. Question and answer platforms usually allow peer-ratings. Answers can be rated by other users. The goal of the rating procedure is to ﬁnd the best, ideally the correct answer from all answers given.  Questions as well as answers have a publishing date and an author. The author’s proﬁle usually shows the author’s nickname, member- ship since, the number of contributions, the number of questions posed, the number of questions answered, and the number of—usually peer-rated—best answers.  According to the works of Agichtein et al.  2008 , the most signiﬁcant indicators for the quality of questions as well as answers are peer rat- ings. Other signiﬁcant features for quality classiﬁcation of questions and answers are features derived from text analysis, such as punctu- ation density in the question’s subject, number of words per sentence, the number of capitalization errors in the question, answer length  re- warding longer texts , unique number of words in an answer, and the word overlap between the question and the answer.  17A short-link is a URL that is shortened in length and still directs to the required  page.   68  3 Metadata in User-Generated Content  3.1.7 Rating and Review Platforms  Rating and review platforms are specialized for ratings and reviews of products, services or experiences. Ratings and reviews can also be part of commercial platforms. Amazon is an example for a commer- cial platform that allows ratings and reviews by users. Content of this type is also referred to as consumer-generated product reviews  Archak, Ghose & Ipeirotis, 2007  or online consumer reviews  Yu, Zha, Wang & Chua, 2011 .  For ratings and reviews the author as well as the date of publishing are displayed to the reader. Reviews are written texts of ﬂexible length. Sometimes pictures can be contributed as well. Ratings are one-click-opinions on diﬀerent scales. Some platforms oﬀer several one-click-opinions for predeﬁned criteria. Sometimes users who are willing to contribute a review have to provide their ratings for all of the predeﬁned criteria oﬀered. On one hand, this can have the advantage that ratings are more diﬀerentiated. On the other hand, the predeﬁned criteria need to ﬁt the object of the rating which is not always the case.18  Furthermore, most platforms allow peer-ratings of the reviews. Plat- forms diﬀer in the scales they oﬀer. Some oﬀer a binary scale This review was helpful to me. and This review was not helpful to me.  e.g., Amazon . Others oﬀer to rate the degree of helpfulness on several levels  e.g., Ciao . Figure 3.11 shows an example of a user-generated content unit and a user’s proﬁle from the rating and review platform Ciao.  To give readers information about the author of a review, the number of helpfuls is displayed along with the review itself. A high number of positive peer-ratings indicates a high quality review.  18For example, Ciao.de makes reviewers rate the smell of electronic products, such as an electric toothbrush  Ciao, 2013 . Smell as rating criterion might be suitable for toothpaste, but is irritating for an electric toothbrush.   3.1 Analysis of Metadata for User-Generated Content  69   cid:1    cid:2   Figure 3.11: A user-generated content unit and a user’s proﬁle  on the rating and review platform Ciao. a: A user-generated content unit published on Ciao. Next to the author’s nickname and her proﬁle pic- ture, is the overall rating the author gave the product  RosesAreRed1207, 2012 . She rated the iPhone 5 with four out of ﬁve stars. Below this a short summary of advantages and disadvantages are given and the review can be accessed. The review has been published on November 6, 2012. On this platform other members can rate reviews on a six-level scale from oﬀ-topic through helpful to exceptional. Other users have rated this review on average exceptional. b: User’s proﬁle. The user’s proﬁle shows additional in- formation. In this case, we learn that the author has been member of the Ciao-community since May 11, 2011. During that time she has written 752 reviews. This platform allows members to select other members they trust and form a network of trustees. The trust relationship is not mutual. This author is trusted by 68 members.   70  3 Metadata in User-Generated Content  Sometimes, users can also comment on reviews. number of comments a review received is displayed.  In this case, the  Most platforms require a registration to contribute reviews. Authors can register with a pseudonym or their real name. Some systems oﬀer to conﬁrm the correctness of the real name  e.g., Amazon . Au- thors’ proﬁles are publicly accessible providing statistics about the user’s reviews to other users. The statistics diﬀer from platform to platform. All platforms display the number of reviews the user has contributed. If peer-ratings are oﬀered, the average peer-rating the author received for his reviews is commonly displayed, too. Some systems oﬀer detailed statistics about peer-ratings and contributions  e.g., Ciao shows number of readings received, number of comments received, number of comments written, etc. .  3.1.8 Social Networks  Social networks are characterized by their users and the connections between them. Connections can be either mutual as the friends con- nection in Facebook or unidirectional as it is in Google’s social net- work Google+. Google+ users can add anyone to their circles  i.e., the user’s networks , the other user does not conﬁrm the connection. For each publication users can specify to which circle they like to publish it.  A user-generated content unit is always published with author and date of publication. A user-generated content unit is published in a social network as part of so-called feeds. Usually, a user-generated content unit appears in the feeds of all users connected with the con- tributor. Therefore, the number of connections indicates a user’s reach. Originally, those postings consisted of short text messages. The possibilities to post photos, links and videos were added gradu- ally. Usually, people can rate entries by leaving one-click-opinions, comment on it and share content with their connections. This leads to a number of further measures, such as number of one-click-opinions,   3.2 Cross-Category Comparison of Metadata  71  number of comments, and number of shares. Figure 3.12 shows two examples of user-generated content units from social networks.  For the purpose of this work it is important to note that content published in social networks might be published only to the limited public. If content is not published to the general public, it should not be analyzed, except the reader is included in a limited public.  3.2 Cross-Category Comparison of Metadata  After appraisal of all the measures that occur in diﬀerent social media categories, the data can be analyzed for patterns. To develop a model- ing concept that provides comparability of information, the collected measures are analyzed for similarities and diﬀerences across the cat- egories.  First of all, the elements that are to be ranked need to be determined. This decides also on which level user-generated content is compared. For user-generated content that stands for itself—that is, it does not refer to other elements and does not have other elements referring to them—this is straightforward. But for a product review for example, it needs to be speciﬁed whether the products, the review, or the comment to the review should be ranked.  It is necessary to distinguish the object of a user-generated content unit  e.g., that can be a product on a rating and review platform or a location on a location sharing and annotation platform , the cent- ral user-generated content unit, and the user-generated content units that refer to the content unit as comments. Figure 3.13 illustrates this structure. It shows the central user-generated content unit as con- tribution in the middle  labeled 1. . A contribution has an author, a source and a publishing date. A contribution can have comments  labeled 2. . A comment can have an author, too. But in the context of this work it is interpreted as additional information about a con- tribution. It is not object of the ranking itself. A contribution can   72   cid:1   3 Metadata in User-Generated Content   cid:2   Figure 3.12: User-generated content units from the social net-  works Google+ and Facebook. The screen-shots show the information that is visible to the unregistered user. Both platforms show the author and the publishing date of the user-generated content units. Fur- thermore, both allow to comment on the content and share it with others. The platforms also reveal who liked, shared and commented on the content units, even to users who are not member of the social networks. a: A user-generated content unit published on Google+. The content unit has received 382 +1— Google’s one-click-opinions—so far  Lobo, 2013b . b: A user-generated content unit published on Face- book. The content unit has received 292 likes—Facebook’s one-click-opinions—so far  Lobo, 2013a .   3.2 Cross-Category Comparison of Metadata  73   cid:6  cid:5    cid:12  cid:20   cid:1  cid:15  cid:29  cid:29  cid:25  cid:23  cid:17  cid:15  cid:16  cid:25  cid:19  cid:9  cid:1  cid:28  cid:16  cid:24  cid:19  cid:17  cid:32  cid:1  cid:28  cid:20   cid:1    cid:17  cid:28  cid:27  cid:32  cid:30  cid:23  cid:16  cid:33  cid:32  cid:23  cid:28  cid:27  cid:1    cid:2  cid:19  cid:5  cid:21  cid:5  cid:4  cid:1  cid:29  cid:30  cid:28  cid:18  cid:33  cid:17  cid:32  cid:1  cid:28  cid:30  cid:1  cid:25  cid:28  cid:17  cid:15  cid:32  cid:23  cid:28  cid:27  cid:3    cid:13  cid:33  cid:16  cid:25  cid:23  cid:31  cid:22  cid:23  cid:27  cid:21  cid:1    cid:18  cid:15  cid:32  cid:19    cid:7  cid:5    cid:14  cid:28  cid:33  cid:30  cid:17  cid:19    cid:10  cid:33  cid:32  cid:22  cid:28  cid:30    cid:11  cid:28  cid:27  cid:32  cid:30  cid:23  cid:16  cid:33  cid:32  cid:23  cid:28  cid:27    cid:8  cid:5    cid:11  cid:28  cid:26  cid:26  cid:19  cid:27  cid:32    cid:10  cid:33  cid:32  cid:22  cid:28  cid:30    cid:13  cid:33  cid:16  cid:25  cid:23  cid:31  cid:22  cid:23  cid:27  cid:21  cid:1    cid:18  cid:15  cid:32  cid:19   Figure 3.13: User-generated content and the allocation of in-  formation. The boxes labeled 0.–2. represent content. It can be text, pictures or other media. The ellipses represent metadata. In the center of consideration is the contribution  1. . The contribution has a publishing date, a source, an author. The contribution can have comments allocated to it  2. . A comment also has an author and usually a publishing date. The contribution can have an object it refers to  0. . For rating and review platforms that can be a product for example.  refer to other objects  labeled 0. in Figure 3.13 . In the context of this work, this is also not object of the ranking.  For each social media category analyzed in Section 3.1, there is a level of granularity for which there is a publishing date, a source where it has been published and an author by whom it was published. In the context of this work, this is the object of the ranking and the level of comparison. It correlates to the contribution in Figure 3.13.  Three basic types of information can be distinguished: content in- formation, primary information, and secondary information.   74  3 Metadata in User-Generated Content  Content information is information derived from the content. For example, if a social media content unit contains text, the text itself can be parsed to derive further information. Simple examples are text length, number of words and sentences or number of question marks or the number of links the text contains. Less simple examples are the numbers of previously deﬁned strings or positive and negative adjectives. For videos, this can be the ﬁle size or the duration of the video.  Primary information is information that is displayed directly on the level with the user-generated content unit. It refers directly to one content unit. The publishing date and the author of a content are examples of information that is always displayed with the content unit  i.e., the user does not have to navigate . Publishing date and author refer to a content unit and can be distinctly allocated.  Secondary information is information that refers to information about a user-generated content unit. Secondary information is often found on a diﬀerent level than the content unit itself. It can refer to more than one content unit. The number of content units an author has contributed is an example for secondary information. It reveals information about the author and cannot be directly allocated to a content unit. But, if we know who the author of a content unit is and we know something about the author, we can draw conclusions about the content units the author publishes.  Secondary information, allocated to a user-generated content unit, can be diﬀerentiated according to the roots of heritage. Informa- tion derived from the thread of a user-generated content unit from a forum is thread inherited information  e.g., number of views of a thread . Source-related information is secondary information that is derived from the source of a social media content unit  e.g., number of community members . Author-related information is secondary information that is derived from an author’s proﬁle  e.g., number of best answers an author contributed .   3.2 Cross-Category Comparison of Metadata  75   cid:20  cid:26  cid:43  cid:39  cid:1  cid:32  cid:26  cid:34  cid:28  cid:39  cid:29  cid:1    cid:18  cid:26  cid:27  cid:26  cid:37  cid:26  cid:34  cid:24  cid:26  cid:38  cid:1    cid:12  cid:35  cid:34  cid:39  cid:26  cid:34  cid:39  cid:1  cid:1    cid:11  cid:40  cid:39  cid:29  cid:35  cid:37  cid:1    cid:9    cid:13  cid:22  cid:39  cid:26  cid:1    cid:19  cid:35  cid:40  cid:37  cid:24  cid:26  cid:1    cid:8    cid:2  cid:1  cid:41  cid:30  cid:26  cid:42  cid:38  cid:1    cid:10   cid:2  cid:1  cid:29  cid:26  cid:32  cid:36  cid:27  cid:40  cid:32  cid:38  cid:1    cid:16  cid:30  cid:24  cid:31  cid:34  cid:22  cid:33  cid:26  cid:1    cid:21  cid:38  cid:26  cid:37  cid:1  cid:22  cid:28  cid:26  cid:1    cid:12  cid:30  cid:39  cid:44  cid:1  cid:35  cid:27   cid:1   cid:37  cid:26  cid:38  cid:30  cid:25  cid:26  cid:34  cid:24  cid:26  cid:1    cid:21  cid:18  cid:14  cid:1  cid:6  cid:1   cid:16  cid:22  cid:33  cid:26  cid:1    cid:2  cid:1  cid:23  cid:22  cid:24  cid:31  cid:32  cid:30  cid:34  cid:31  cid:38  cid:1    cid:2  cid:1  cid:27  cid:35  cid:32  cid:32  cid:35  cid:42  cid:30  cid:34  cid:28  cid:1    cid:2  cid:1  cid:33  cid:26  cid:33  cid:23  cid:26  cid:37  cid:38  cid:1    cid:2  cid:1  cid:36  cid:35  cid:38  cid:39  cid:30  cid:34  cid:28  cid:38  cid:1    cid:19  cid:39  cid:22  cid:39  cid:40  cid:38  cid:1    cid:2  cid:1  cid:27  cid:35  cid:32  cid:32  cid:35  cid:42  cid:26  cid:37  cid:38  cid:1    cid:45  cid:1    cid:45  cid:1    cid:7    cid:2  cid:1  cid:37  cid:26  cid:36  cid:32  cid:30  cid:26  cid:38  cid:1    cid:2  cid:1  cid:32  cid:30  cid:31  cid:26  cid:38  cid:1    cid:15  cid:26  cid:33  cid:23  cid:26  cid:37  cid:1    cid:38  cid:30  cid:34  cid:24  cid:26  cid:1    cid:2  cid:1  cid:36  cid:35  cid:38  cid:39  cid:30  cid:34  cid:28  cid:38  cid:1    cid:45   cid:17  cid:37  cid:30  cid:33  cid:22  cid:37  cid:44  cid:1  cid:30  cid:34  cid:27  cid:35  cid:37  cid:33  cid:22  cid:39  cid:30  cid:35  cid:34  cid:1   cid:45   cid:19  cid:26  cid:24  cid:35  cid:34  cid:25  cid:22  cid:37  cid:44  cid:1  cid:30  cid:34  cid:27  cid:35  cid:37  cid:33  cid:22  cid:39  cid:30  cid:35  cid:34  cid:1   cid:45   cid:45    cid:19  cid:36  cid:26  cid:24  cid:30  cid:27  cid:30  cid:24  cid:1  cid:30  cid:34  cid:27  cid:35  cid:37  cid:33  cid:22  cid:39  cid:30  cid:35  cid:34  cid:1   cid:12  cid:35  cid:34  cid:39  cid:26  cid:34  cid:39  cid:1  cid:30  cid:34  cid:27  cid:35  cid:37  cid:33  cid:22  cid:39  cid:30  cid:35  cid:34  cid:1  cid:1    cid:3    cid:2  cid:11  cid:3  cid:7  cid:8  cid:3  cid:4  cid:8  cid:5  cid:1  cid:6  cid:9  cid:10  cid:1    cid:26  cid:5  cid:28  cid:5  cid:4  cid:1  cid:27  cid:35  cid:37  cid:40  cid:33  cid:38  cid:4  cid:1  cid:23  cid:32  cid:35  cid:28  cid:38  cid:1  cid:1    cid:26  cid:5  cid:28  cid:5  cid:4  cid:1  cid:27  cid:35  cid:37  cid:40  cid:33  cid:38  cid:1    cid:26  cid:5  cid:28  cid:5  cid:4  cid:1  cid:38  cid:35  cid:24  cid:30  cid:22  cid:32  cid:1  cid:34  cid:26  cid:39  cid:42  cid:35  cid:37  cid:31  cid:38  cid:1    cid:26  cid:5  cid:28  cid:5  cid:4  cid:1  cid:37  cid:26  cid:41  cid:30  cid:26  cid:42  cid:38  cid:1    cid:7  cid:1    cid:8  cid:1    cid:9  cid:1    cid:10  cid:1   Figure 3.14: Types of information for user-generated content  units. User-generated content units consist of content and further information. Author, date, and source are primary inform- ation. Secondary information is further information about primary information. Speciﬁc information is available for some platforms for others not. Content information is in- formation derived from the content.  There is source-related information that can be assessed for all cat- egories. An example is the number of back-links to a source. There is also source-related information that is speciﬁc for certain categor- ies. The number of members of a community in a social network is an example. Similarly, there are diﬀerent kinds of author-related inform- ation that can be assessed through the author’s proﬁle, depending on the platform. Microblogs for example oﬀer the number of followers and the total number of tweets, whereas forums show the number   76  3 Metadata in User-Generated Content  of contributions without number of followers since that concept does not exist in forums. Nevertheless, both examples reveal further in- formation about the author.  Speciﬁc information occurs only on certain platforms. Speciﬁc information is not available for all types of user-generated content. Various forms of peer-ratings are examples.  Figure 3.14 shows an overview of all types of information related to a user-generated content unit.  3.3 From Data to Information: Semantics of  Metadata  A datum without a meaning is just a number. When data have meaning, it becomes information that is useful for humans. Focus of the following section is the interpretation of the metadata available for user-generated content.  3.3.1 Why It Matters Who the Author Is  Conducting information from an author to his assertions is a well- known concept. If someone likes the novel Great Expectations, he might want to read David Copperﬁeld as well, because it is also a novel by Charles Dickens. Of course, it may happen that one novel of an author is excellent and another is not. But, although we cannot draw conclusions that are reliable in every case, it is an approximation that proved eﬃcient for the majority of cases.  Expertism is another example of how the reputation of an author is used to draw conclusions about the content he or she produces. In traditional media, an example for trusted experts are journalists. An article written by a journalist is expected to be of better quality than an article by a layman. The same applies for scientists and their   3.3 From Data to Information: Semantics of Metadata  77  publications. An academic degree increases the trustworthiness of a contribution to a discourse induced by assumed expertism. In sci- ence, authors are more likely to be cited if they have already been cited more often than comparable work. A highly rewarded scientist who has published many well respected works is expected to publish more work that deserves respect. Quoting this well respected author will probably be more convincing than quoting someone unknown. If someone announces the consumption of onions would relieve migraine symptoms, more people will try it if that someone is a neurology pro- fessor, than if that someone is an organic farmer. These conclusions are not necessarily correct for every single publication. But neverthe- less, even though it is not precise, it is an eﬃcient approximation.  With the advent of social media, readers are confronted with many authors; more than they could ever learn enough about to judge their content by their reputation. Some users might have the feeling that this mass of authors contributing content in social media virtually equals complete anonymity. But, there is information about authors in social media, too. An author who has written several contributions has proved his loyalty over the last years of his membership, whereas for an author who has just joined a community it is unknown whether he only joined the community to fake positive reviews about his own products. An author who has many followers has probably a higher reach than an author who has just a few. An author who received many best answer peer-ratings for his answers is probably more reli- able than an author who has just contributed his ﬁrst answer.  Authors’ proﬁles vary signiﬁcantly in the amount of personal inform- ation provided. There are authors who provide proﬁle pictures, real names, contact information, and even provide the link to their per- sonal Web site, whereas other authors provide a nickname only. Stud- ies suggest that Web site credibility is enhanced by providing personal and contact information  Fogg, Marshall, Laraki, Osipovich, Varma, Fang, Paul, Rangnekar, Shon, Swani & Treinen, 2001; Fogg, Marshall, Osipovich, Varma, Laraki, Fang, Paul, Rangnekar, Shon, Swani et al., 2000; Fogg, Soohoo, Danielson, Marable, Stanford & Tauber, 2003 .   78  3 Metadata in User-Generated Content  3.3.2 Why It Matters Where Something Is Published  The source of a publication allows to draw conclusions about the publication itself. Properties of a source can be applied to predict the probability for a piece of content published within that platform to have these properties as well. This concept is well established. It is a concept known to users from traditional media.  television channels are examples. Newspapers, book publishers, When a reader decides to buy a newspaper, there are expectations about its contents. Political orientations and sophistication are ex- amples. The quality and credibility of an article can be roughly clas- siﬁed by the kind of newspaper it is published in. If an article is published in The New York Times for example, readers probably ex- pect it to be more credible and of higher quality than an article from a boulevard magazine.  Further conclusions can be drawn from a newspapers reach. A local newspaper covers diﬀerent stories than an international newspaper. And if a story is published in a newspaper with a high run, the news it contains will probably reach more people.  Social media platforms vary widely in their size. The size of a platform can be measured by number of contributions and num- ber of members or visitors. The number of visitors correlates with the potential reach of the platform’s content. A message being shared through Twitter—a platform that has 200 million active users  Wickre, 2013 —has a higher potential reach than a message pub- lished in a small forum that has 5,000 members. The number of incoming links is an indicator of the probability that the random surfer 19 visits the platform and an indicator of its relative import- ance  Page et al., 1998 . The probability is higher that users read an article accidentally if it is published on a platform that has many  19The random surfer is a notion used by Page et al.  1998 . The random surfer surfs the Web by randomly following its hyperlink structure. When he arrives at a page with several outlinks, he randomly chooses one, navigates to the new page and continues this process indeﬁnitely  Langville & Meyer, 2006 .   3.3 From Data to Information: Semantics of Metadata  79  incoming links than if it is published on an unnoticed personal blog that has no incoming links. The mechanism can be compared to the print run of newspapers. An article published in a small local news- paper is less likely to be spread than an article published in a widely read international newspaper.  3.3.3 What the Content Reveals  User-generated content can consist of texts, pictures, video, and audio ﬁles, or a mixture of them. Often, nontext multi-media content is also accompanied by descriptive text.  Text can be analyzed for text features that are known to correlate with characteristics of the text. Studies show that citations, refer- ences and other kinds of source material contribute to a text’s credibil- ity  Fogg et al., 2000, 2001 . Links within the text of a user-generated content unit can help to ascertain the source of information and indic- ate utility as they point to additional sources of information that can help the user  Moturu, 2010; Elgersma & de Rijke, 2008 . Quotation marks are an indicator for citations as well, but they are also com- monly used to indicate irony. A solution for the disambiguation of quotation marks used for irony and quotation marks used for citations could be that, in the case of irony, typically only one or two words are set in quotation marks, whereas a quotation is usually longer.  There are also machine learning algorithms that can be applied to de- tect quality ﬂaws. Anderka et al. propose an approach for automatic quality ﬂaw detection for Wikipedia articles. They propose to inter- pret the detection of quality ﬂaws as one-class classiﬁcation problem identifying articles that contain a particular quality ﬂaw among a set of articles. An example for a frequent quality ﬂaw is not citing any references or sources in an article  Anderka, Stein & Lipka, 2011b . The texts that contain a particular quality ﬂaw are given as posit- ive examples to decide for unseen texts whether they contain that particular ﬂaw. For each known ﬂaw, an expert is asked whether a   80  3 Metadata in User-Generated Content  given document suﬀers from it. Based on the manually tagged docu- ment set, for each ﬂaw a one-class classiﬁer is evaluated, trained, and tested.  The automatic determination of text quality is object of many re- search projects   e.g., Chen, Liu, Chang & Lee, 2010; Kakkonen, Myller, Timonen & Sutinen, 2005 . Typically, these approaches ana- lyze texts for predeﬁned vocabulary and text structure. Predeﬁned vocabulary is not applicable to the task at hand. First of all, it is typical for user-generated content that neologisms and abbreviations are used. Furthermore, vocabulary is language-dependent and the work at hand aims at a language-independent approach. For the automated quality assessment of Wikipedia articles Dalip, Gon¸calves, Cristo & Calado  2009  show that text length as well as structure and style are the most important quality features. Text length is a fea- ture often used as quality indicator  e.g., Moturu, 2010; Dalip et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2007 . Concerns are that text structure is not ap- plicable to all types of user-generated content, because there are no common conveniences for text structure that apply to all platforms under consideration.  Which metrics are used to determine the quality of content is a choice that also needs to be based on the desired accuracy and the avail- able resources. Text length is a feature that can be easily extracted, whereas a classiﬁcation approach requires more processing resources.  3.3.4 What Other People Tell Us  “Under the right circumstances, groups are remarkably intelligent, and are often smarter than the smartest people in them.”  Surowiecki, 2005, p. XIII . The wisdom of the crowds phenomenon refers to the observation that the aggregated solutions from a group of individuals are sometimes better than the majority of the individual solutions. Traditionally, it has been applied to point estimation of continuous- valued physical quantities for example  Surowiecki, 2005 . The use of   3.4 The Social Media Document View  81  the wisdom of the crowds is an emerging ﬁeld of research. It has also been widely applied for discrete labeling  Raykar, Yu, Zhao, Valadez, Florin, Bogoni & Moy, 2010 , the prediction of urban traﬃc routes  Yu, Low, Oran & Jaillet, 2012 , and Web page clipping  Zhang, Tang, Luo, Chen, Jiao, Wang & Liu, 2012 . Wisdom of the crowds can be applied to assist individuals in their decision making process by gathering data about the decisions taken by a group of individuals.  For social media, every one-click-opinion—every thumbs up, every like, every +1, and so on—is an assessment of a content unit. Each interaction—be it a one-click-opinion of any kind or a comment— with a content unit means that a user felt that a content unit was worth spending time with it. User interactions with a contribution are a valuable source of information for other users who search for interesting content. Mishne & Glance  2006  demonstrate that the number of comments is a strong indicator for the popularity of a blog post. Compared to a comment, the amount of time a user invests is relatively small when he contributes a one-click-opinion. But, a one- click-opinion is an explicit expression of opinion. The more people consider a content unit is worth an interaction, the higher is the probability that the content unit might be interesting for other users as well. The collection of all user interactions with a content unit is a crowd sourced assessment of the content unit that can serve as recommendation for other users.  3.4 The Social Media Document View  The social media document view comprises the structure all user- generated content units have in common.20 Traditionally, the term  20The modeling approach presented here is based on the analysis of the metadata of the evaluated platforms. The platforms have been chosen as representatives that cover the typical range for the analyzed categories to allow transferabil- ity of results. However, when statements are made about how platforms or platform categories function, it is not impossible that there are or there will be platforms for which the statements do not apply. The descriptions of plat-   82  3 Metadata in User-Generated Content  document is used to refer to a unit of information, typically consisting of text. It can also contain other media. A document can be a whole book, an article, or be part of a larger text such as a paragraph, a section or a chapter. Here, the term social media document has been chosen paralleling traditional information retrieval, where the ranked units are also referred to as documents.  Based on the patterns revealed by the cross-category analysis, further conclusions can be drawn for a social media document. I propose a social media speciﬁc document view for user-generated content units.  A social media document always has a certain structure that is inde- pendent from the category it belongs to. The user-generated content unit always contains content. This can be text, pictures, audio or video ﬁles or a combination of them. Measures derived from the con- tent itself are in the following referred to as intrinsic information. An example for intrinsic information is the number of references  i.e., links  a text contains.  Metadata about the content on the level of primary information is extrinsic information. Examples for extrinsic information are the number of replies and the number of likes.  Secondary information that is not speciﬁc to a category but is equally provided throughout all social media categories leads to two further elements of the social media document: author-related information and source-related information  cf., Section 3.2 . Author-related in- formation can be assessed through the author’s identiﬁer  e.g., the author’s nickname concatenated to the source name . Source-related information is information about the source and can be assessed through the source’s identiﬁer  e.g., its URL .  This is the structure all user-generated content units have in com- mon. Figure 3.15 illustrates the structure. Within the elements of  forms and patterns are empirical observations of the platforms as they were at the time of the development of this work. The presented approach has been designed aiming at robustness towards variation and changes, but nevertheless, it does make no claim to be universally valid.   3.4 The Social Media Document View  83

A forum’s user-generated content unit has author-related information such as days of membership and number of postings published. It has information about the post itself, such as the publishing date and the number of comments. Source-related information for forums are back-links, the number of active members in the forum’s community, topic size, and so on.  page. User-generated content units are parts of web pages and are not considered in this view. Hence, the traditional site-centered view does not apply to user-generated content. I prose a diﬀerent view— the social media document view—that is adequate for the required granularity of user-generated content.  The social media document view takes into account that one Web page can contain diﬀerent user-generated content units published by several authors at various times with varying quality. It shifts the focus from the Web page to the content unit. Furthermore, the social   3.4 The Social Media Document View  85  media document view accounts for the user’s role. In the traditional site-centered view the user does not occur. It was not necessary because the former role of the user was one of passive consumption. Nowadays, the user can actively participate. The World Wide Web of today is signiﬁcantly co-authored by users. It consists of users acting either as authors publishing content or as readers consuming the content. The user’s passive role has shifted to the active role of a contributor. With the author-related information as inherent part of the modeling, the social media document view accounts for that development.   4 Towards Query-Independent  Ranking  Two roads diverged in a wood, and I — I took the one less traveled by  Robert Lee Frost, 1916  The goal of information retrieval is to provide a user with the in- formation he seeks. The information the user desires is referred to as information need. The technique with which a retrieval sys- tem chooses documents and presents them to the user is referred to as information retrieval method. The documents the retrieval system chooses from a larger set of documents in the retrieval pro- cess are the retrieved documents. Which documents are retrieved depends on the information retrieval method applied. Whether the retrieved documents satisfy the user, depends on his information need. Consequently, the choice of the proper information retrieval method depends on the information need the system is designed for.  To design a retrieval system that satisﬁes its users there are three main parts to consider: the information need, the information re- trieval method, and the objects of retrieval. The following chapter examines this threefold complex. After the introduction of the diﬀer- ent kinds of information needs in Section 4.1, I shall point out that traditional information retrieval focuses on a limited number of in- formation needs which can be formulated in a search term. Section 4.2  C. Wyrwoll, Social Media, DOI 10.1007 978-3-658-06984-1_4,   Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden 2014   88  4 Towards Query-Independent Ranking  gives an overview of information retrieval methods. Section 4.3 ex- plains the speciﬁcs of user-generated documents and why the known query-independent concepts do not suﬃce for user-generated content. Moreover, advantages of query-independent ranking methods speciﬁc- ally for user-generated content shall be discussed.  4.1 User Information Needs and Search  Strategies  There is a variety of information needs a user can have. In a library a reader can be looking for a book a friend recommended to him. The strategy he should apply to ﬁnd the book recommended by his friend depends on the information he has about the book. He might know the title or the author. With this information he can retrieve exactly the book he is looking for. This is an example of known- item search. The user knows about the existence of the item he is looking for. It can be a speciﬁc book in the library or a speciﬁc ﬁle on his hard drive. Alternatively, the reader could be looking for a book about how to feed red pandas. This case is less straightforward. The searcher has to articulate keywords that represent the topic. Then he can try to ﬁnd a book on the desired topic by matching the search terms with the title of the book or its content. Maybe the library oﬀers topic related sections, which help to ﬁnd books about certain topics. This is an example of topical search. The user knows what he wants to know. This knowledge helps him to articulate search terms. A reader might also come to the library with the desire to read the book read by the most people. There is no search term that expresses her information need. She can not just search for “the most read book.” The books that match this search query will probably not be the most read books. The only chance to ﬁnd the most popular book is if the library kept information about how many times a book has been borrowed and then look for the one with the highest number of lendings. This type of search is diﬀerent from the   4.1 User Information Needs and Search Strategies  89  other two. There is no keyword or search query that expresses this information need. Those types of information needs are not speciﬁc to common bibliographic systems.  Information needs can be classiﬁed according to if and how straight- forward they can be expressed as search term. We diﬀerentiate between information needs that can easily be expressed as search term and information needs that cannot be expressed as search term. Content-related information needs can easily be transferred into a search term. An example is the information need “The book with the title How to Feed Pandas.” The corresponding search term can be derived from the known title of the book. Another example is the information need “What has been written about Lindsey Vonn?” The corresponding search term could be “Lindsey Vonn.” Feature- related information needs are not transferable into a search query. Examples are: “What is the most important news of today?” and “What do people talk most about?” In practice, feature-related in- formation needs and content-related information needs can often oc- cur in conjunction. An example would be: “What is the most im- portant news about Lindsey Vonn?”  Feature-related information needs are the types of questions that a user should be able to ask in the context of user-generated con- tent. Additionally, content-related information needs are well studied. There are many approaches that can be applied to user-generated content. Feature-related information needs on the other hand are not that well studied and there are no approaches that are easily applicable to user-generated content. This work will focus on the feature-related information needs.  Diﬀerent information needs require diﬀerent search strategies. Search strategies can be classiﬁed into two main types: exploratory search and nonexploratory search  Baeza-Yates, Boldi, Bozzon, Brambilla, Ceri & Pasi, 2011 . In a nonexploratory search the user knows what he wants, whereas exploratory search is often applied when the user does not have an exact idea of what he wants to ﬁnd.   90  4 Towards Query-Independent Ranking  There are several diﬀerent terms used to describe nonexploratory search strategies, such as ﬁnding facts, satisfy information queries  Marchionini & Shneiderman, 1988, p. 70 seqq. , and complex search  Baeza-Yates et al., 2011 . Marchionini  2006, p. 42  describes non- exploratory search as “look up search tasks” which comprises fact re- trieval, known item search, navigation, transaction, veriﬁcation, and question answering. When users perform a nonexploratory search, they usually know exactly what they are looking for. They have a clear picture of what a satisfying result will look like and can express their search intention. The search is planned in advance. Terms and logical connectives can be systematically combined. It may be a speciﬁc source, author, title, subject, and so on the user has in mind.  In an exploratory search, users do not know exactly what they are looking for. Exploratory search is also referred to as browsing or browsing knowledge. This information seeking strategy is appropri- ate for ill-deﬁned problems and to explore new task domains. It includes search to learn and search to investigate. Search to learn comprises information seeking activities such as knowledge acquis- ition, comprehension, aggregation and social search, where people aim to ﬁnd communities of interest. Search to investigate includes accretion, analysis, synthesis, evaluation, discovery, planning, and transformation. All these search activities require human participa- tion in a more exploratory and less formalized process.  Marchionini, 2006   To sum it up, there are diﬀerent information needs a user can have. There are also diﬀerent search strategies a user can follow and there are diﬀerent information retrieval methods that can be implemen- ted in the system. Some information needs can be converted into a search term. Those information needs can be satisﬁed by search en- gines that are based on and optimized in query matching approaches. But, there are information needs that can not be transferred to a search term. Those require diﬀerent approaches. Information need and search strategy are user related, and the information retrieval method is system related. The information need and the retrieval   4.2 Query-Dependent and Query-Independent Ranking  91  If information need and re- method are ﬁxed in a given situation. trieval strategy are not appropriate for each other, the only variable the user can adapt to the situation is his search strategy. The user can adjust his search strategy only as much as the system enables it. To support exploratory search, Marchionini  2006  proposes that the search interface should allow more human interaction in the search process. I suggest to consider the information retrieval strategies with regard to the information needs that can be satisﬁed with them. The following section introduces information retrieval strategies.  4.2 Query-Dependent and Query-Independent  Ranking  Generally speaking, information retrieval is about ﬁnding informa- tion  Goker & Davies, 2009 . Information retrieval aims at ﬁnding material of an unstructured nature that satisﬁes an information need from within large collections, usually stored on computers  Manning, Raghavan & Sch¨utze, 2008 . This ﬁeld of study has a relatively long tradition. Already in 1950, the term “information retrieval” was coined by Mooers  1950 .  4.2.1 Ranking in Information Retrieval  Information retrieval covers the retrieval process as well as ranking approaches. The retrieval task is to separate a set of information ob- jects into two subsets; one subset containing the information objects that meet speciﬁc criteria and one subset containing the other docu- ments. Usually, the information objects form a set of documents that is separated into one subset that contains a search term—the retrieved documents—and another subset that does not.  Ranking is a function which associates a real number with a docu- ment representation in such a way that an ordering among the docu-   92  4 Towards Query-Independent Ranking  ments can be established. The ranking function is designed with the goal that the documents appearing at the top of the ordering are considered to be more likely to be relevant  Baeza-Yates & Ribeiro- Neto, 2003 . Even though the retrieval and the ranking process can be diﬀerentiated, in information retrieval it is common practice to speak of “retrieval” when “retrieval and ranking” is meant. This becomes feasible when we think about the ranking process as the retrieval of the n documents that have the highest rank. The retrieval process as well as the ranking approach can be either query-dependent or query-independent.  A query-dependent ranking of documents is a ranking function Rd qi, dj  which associates a real number with a query qi ∈ Q and a document representation dj ∈ D. This ranking deﬁnes an order- ing among the documents with regards to the query qi  Baeza-Yates & Ribeiro-Neto, 2003 . As a matter of course, query-dependent ap- proaches require the entry of a query by the user.  Query-dependent retrieval is traditionally based on term frequencies  Goker & Davies, 2009 . The basic assumption is that the more two representations agree in given elements and their distribution, the higher is the probability that they represent similar information. To measure the similarity between documents and queries, those are transferred to a vector representation that allows to apply vector space theory to documents. In the vector space model, the docu- ment d is transferred to a vector  cid:2 d =  d1, d2, . . . , dm  of which each component dk 1 ≤ k ≤ m  is associated with an index term or pre- deﬁned keywords. Similarly the query q is expressed as a vector  cid:2 q =  q1, q2, . . . , qm  where the elements qk 1 ≤ k ≤ m  are associated with the same terms as the document. The vector can then have bin- ary components expressing whether a term occurs in a document or query. For a more general representation natural numbers can be used to encode the frequency of a term. A document’s vector then con- sists of the number of occurrences of the keywords in the document’s text. Furthermore, real numbers are used when terms are weighted according to their importance. The representations of the document   4.2 Query-Dependent and Query-Independent Ranking  93  and the query are now considered as vectors in a high-dimensional Euclidean space, where each term is assigned a separate dimension  Salton & McGill, 1986 . The similarity measure is the cosine of the angle that separates the two vectors of the document and the query  Goker & Davies, 2009 . This is also referred to as cosine similarity  Ferber, 2003 . Generally speaking, modeling documents as vectors is a well established concept in information retrieval  Kao & Poteet, 2010, 2005; Grossman & Frieder, 2004 . Even though this traditional approach is suﬃcient neither for Web pages nor for user-generated content, the vector space model where documents are represented as vectors is a powerful approach. It is a basic concept for the modeling approach introduced in Chapter 5.  Query-independent approaches use other criteria than search terms to retrieve or rank a set of documents. An example for query- independent retrieval is the creation of a subset of documents that are shorter than 125 characters. An example for query-independent rank- ing is when documents that contain more characters are ranked higher than documents containing less characters. Query-independent rank- ing can be applied alone or in combination with query-dependent retrieval. Query-independent ranking can also be combined with query-dependent ranking. In this case it serves as improvement of the retrieval process. Query-independent ranking allows to assign scores to documents without the need of a search query entered by the user. This can be useful when search terms are not suitable to represent an information need.  Standard measures of retrieval eﬀectiveness are precision and recall  Saracevic, 2007 . Recall refers to the attempt to retrieve all the relevant documents and expresses how many of all the relevant docu- ments are retrieved. Precision refers to the desire to retrieve as few of the nonrelevant as possible at the same time  Van Rijsbergen, 1979 . It provides an indication of the quality of the retrieved docu- ment set. Hence, precision is the ratio of the total number of relevant documents retrieved to the total number of documents retrieved. Re- call is the ratio of the number of relevant documents retrieved to the   94  4 Towards Query-Independent Ranking  total number of documents in the collection  Grossman & Frieder, 2004 . In an ideal, perfect retrieval process the set of documents re- trieved and the set of relevant documents would be equal. Figure 4.1 illustrates the relationship between precision and recall. Aim of any retrieval process is to retrieve as many relevant documents as possible while minimizing the retrieval of nonrelevant documents.   cid:3  cid:11  cid:11  cid:1  cid:8  cid:14  cid:7  cid:18  cid:12  cid:9  cid:13  cid:17  cid:16    cid:5  cid:9  cid:11  cid:9  cid:19  cid:6  cid:13  cid:17    cid:5  cid:9  cid:11  cid:9  cid:19  cid:6  cid:13  cid:17  cid:1   cid:5  cid:9  cid:17  cid:15  cid:10  cid:9  cid:19  cid:9  cid:8    cid:5  cid:9  cid:17  cid:15  cid:10  cid:9  cid:19  cid:9  cid:8    cid:4  cid:15  cid:9  cid:7  cid:10  cid:16  cid:10  cid:14  cid:13  cid:1  cid:2  cid:1    cid:5  cid:9  cid:11  cid:9  cid:19  cid:6  cid:13  cid:17  cid:1  cid:5  cid:9  cid:17  cid:15  cid:10  cid:9  cid:19  cid:9  cid:8    cid:5  cid:9  cid:17  cid:15  cid:10  cid:9  cid:19  cid:9  cid:8    cid:5  cid:9  cid:7  cid:6  cid:11  cid:11  cid:1  cid:2  cid:1    cid:5  cid:9  cid:11  cid:9  cid:19  cid:6  cid:13  cid:17  cid:1  cid:5  cid:9  cid:17  cid:15  cid:10  cid:9  cid:19  cid:9  cid:8    cid:5  cid:9  cid:11  cid:9  cid:19  cid:6  cid:13  cid:17   Figure 4.1: Precision and recall.  The result set of a retrieval process comprises documents that are relevant but not retrieved, documents that are re- trieved but not relevant and the document that are retrieved and relevant. Precision is the ratio of the correctly retrieved documents and all retrieved documents. Recall is the ratio of the correctly retrieved documents and the total number of relevant documents. Figure adapted from  Grossman & Frieder, 2004 .  In the context of this work, the goal is to rank in such a way that as many relevant user-generated content units as possible are ranked   4.2 Query-Dependent and Query-Independent Ranking  95  highly, while the amount of nonrelevant user-generated content units with a high rank should be minimized.  In information retrieval relevance is often described as the corres- pondence in context between an information requirement statement  a query  and an article  a document   Salton & McGill, 1986; Ferber, 2003; Saracevic, 2007 . This is meant to reﬂect the degree in which a document satisﬁes the interest of the user  Saracevic, 2007 . A weakness of this notion is that what “satisﬁes the interest of the user” is hard to grasp. A common practice to seize this notion of relev- ance is to let “specialists” provide a collection of relevant documents to evaluate the retrieval performance  Baeza-Yates & Ribeiro-Neto, 2003, p. 74 . Another serious weakness of this notion is that it does not cover query-independent aspects of relevance. This view does not take into account that there are relevance aspects independent from context and queries. They simply aim at the degree in which the text meets search criteria. To cope with this weakness several models have been developed to describe relevance more speciﬁcally. There are two diﬀerent classes of relevance measures: universal and individual relevance measures, also known as objective and subjective aspects.  The focus of this work is on query-independent ranking based on ob- jective relevance aspects. Query-dependent retrieval can be combined with the approach presented in Chapter 5, but it is not part of this work.  The focus of information retrieval is on query-dependent retrieval and ranking  Li, 2011; Ferber, 2003; Salton & McGill, 1986 . Those are well studied whereas query-independent ranking has not been studied as rigorously  Goker & Davies, 2009 .  Summing it up, information need and search strategy are user related, whereas the information retrieval method is system related. In a given situation, the information need and the retrieval method are ﬁxed. If information need and retrieval strategy are not appropriate for each other, the only variable the user can alter in the situation is his search   96  4 Towards Query-Independent Ranking  strategy. But, the user can adjust his search strategy only as much as he system enables it. Table 4.1 shows an overview of the ranges there are in information need, search strategy and information retrieval method.

But, ranking based on term frequencies is not strong enough for Web content  Goker & Davies, 2009 . An example scenario shall illustrate that. A user looks for information about the Canadian government. She formulates the query Canada government. A good result could be any page about important as- pects of the topic. Anyhow, a page such as www.canada.gc.ca is likely to be a good answer. Now, let us consider a traditional ranking process based on term frequencies that aims at getting this page on top of the ranking in a set that contains 100 million matching pages. The page has a term frequency of Canada=11 and government=9.1 This approach is not strong enough to guarantee a top ranking for that page. Other pages may contain more occurrences of the query terms. The two most important sources of information improving the ranking of Web pages are link structure and URL hierarchy. With  1Term frequencies are taken from www.canada.gc.ca, July 23rd, 2013   4.2 Query-Dependent and Query-Independent Ranking  97  3,820 incoming links the page www.canada.gc.ca is relatively heavily linked.2 Additionally, the URL of this page is a short URL and it is the root page for a hostname. The incoming links might also contain the search terms in their anchor text. The page would be more likely to be on top of a ranking that takes this additional evidence into account. To be useful on Web content query-dependent relevance scores need to be combined with query-independent evidence  Goker & Davies, 2009 .  Query-independent ranking is mostly discussed in the context of Web page retrieval  Richardson, Prakash & Brill, 2006 . In the context of Web page retrieval query-dependent approaches are also referred to as dynamic ranking. Objective relevance is covered by static ranking. In Web page retrieval the retrieved and ranked objects are Web pages and the query-independent feature for ranking is based on link analysis. An important approach for the query-independent ranking of Web pages is the PageRank.  Generally speaking, in the ﬁrst phase of Web retrieval each page is assigned a static rank which is independent of a query. This can be viewed as reﬂecting the general quality, authority or popularity of a page. It should correspond to a page’s or document’s prior probability of relevance. The higher the probability of relevance, the higher the static rank. Query matching takes place in the second phase of Web retrieval  B¨uttcher, Clarke & Cormack, 2010 . Since the goal of this work is a query-independent ranking, the focus is on the ﬁrst phase here.  The PageRank uses incoming links to determine a score for Web pages with respect to its relevance, independent of the user’s query  Gross- man & Frieder, 2004 . The ﬁrst step and essence of the PageRank is a query-independent ranking algorithm. The PageRank algorithm was introduced by Page et al. in the context of a doctoral thesis at Stan- ford University supervised by Winograd  Stanford, 2013 . Page et al.  1998, p. 1  felt they had to cope with a huge and growing amount of  2The number of in-linking pages are taken from www.google.com, July 23rd, 2013   98  4 Towards Query-Independent Ranking  diverse data: “Current estimates are that there are over 150 million Web pages with a doubling life of less than one year. More import- antly, the Web pages are extremely diverse.” Even though diverse in regards to content, Web pages have a structural feature in common. They contain additional information in the form of links. Inspired by academic citation analysis, the PageRank takes advantage of the link structure of the World Wide Web to produce a global ranking of Web pages regardless of their content. A Web page is weighed by the number of other Web pages that link to it. That is the basic idea. Additionally, the in-linking pages are weighed by the number of pages that link to them. The result is a recursive algorithm that ranks Web pages according to importance depending on their con- nectedness within the link structure of the World Wide Web. The underlying assumption is that highly linked pages are more import- ant than pages with only a few other pages referencing them. A page that has many pages linking to it can be just as important as a page that has only few but highly connected pages linking to it. The idea of the PageRank can be formalized as follows  Page et al., 1998, p. 3 : u being a Web page, Fu being the set of pages u points to and Bu being the set of pages that point to u. Let Nu = Fu be the number of forward links from u and let c be a factor for normalization, the simpliﬁed PageRank R is:  R u  = c   cid:3   v∈Bu  R v  Nv   4.1   Even though it is eﬃcient for ranking Web pages, the PageRank is not eﬀective for user-generated content. User-generated content is part of a Web page. The rank for a Web page is the same for all user-generated content units on that Web page. The statement that could be derived from the PageRank for the single user-generated content unit is meaningless. The granularity of the PageRank is too coarse for the purpose of ranking user-generated content. Also, the principle of link analysis is not suﬃcient for user-generated content. Commonly, user-generated content units do not contain links. They   4.3 Shortcomings of Traditional Information Retrieval Concepts 99  do occasionally, but not in an extend that would make link analysis appropriate as ranking feature.  4.3 Shortcomings of Traditional Information  Retrieval Concepts  Information retrieval has a relatively long tradition regarding the retrieval of text documents. A feasible question could be if it does deliver approaches that could be applied to user-generated content as well. User-generated content units often contain text as well. They could therefore be treated like other text documents. But, traditional information retrieval focuses on the information the user sends with the search query. The rich source of valuable information that is now available as metadata of user-generated content is not used. Tradi- tional query-dependent approaches can be applied to user-generated content as well, but they do not suﬃce since they neglect all of the other information a user could use to classify user-generated content.  The large amount of information available online also requires dif- ferent strategies. Traditional relevance ranking technologies attempt to retrieve pages that contain relevant text. But, ranking based on term frequencies is not strong enough for Web content. The result set of a retrieval process of Web content based on term frequencies can still be very large. Additional information is required to provide users with an appropriate amount of results. To be useful for Web content, query-dependent relevance scores need to be combined with query-independent evidence  Goker & Davies, 2009 .  More specialized approaches for Web page retrieval do solve that prob- lem for Web pages, but do not apply to user-generated content either, since the object of retrieval is of a diﬀerent kind. User-generated con- tent is part of a Web page and not a small Web page for itself. On one Web page there can be many social media entries, all diﬀerent in quality, authorship, date and relevance. The concept of rating a   100  4 Towards Query-Independent Ranking  Web page is not applicable to social media content. It requires the ranking and rating of content units. That requires a diﬀerent level of granularity. So, query-independent approaches that are based on link analysis cannot be transferred to user-generated content.  Furthermore, the user’s information needs can be diﬀerent in the con- text of user-generated content. Of course, a user might also still have content-related information needs concerning user-generated content. He might want to have speciﬁc advises others give on, for example, the successful grow of roses, expressing roses in his search query. But additionally, users might have information needs independent of the content, not expressible in a search query. For example, they want to know which video everybody watches this week. If a user does not know the currently trending video is called Gangnam Style, she cannot search for it. Feature-related information needs and query- independent ranking have not been studied as rigorously as query- dependent ranking for content-related search  Goker & Davies, 2009 .  Speciﬁcally for user-generated content there is a need for research and new approaches especially for query-independent ranking.   5 A Cross-Platform Ranking  Approach  The development of a query-independent ranking approach for user- generated content is the main goal of this thesis. The following chapter presents a modeling and a ranking solution1 based on the insights presented in the previous chapters. Section 5.1 proposes a vector notation for the central characteristics of a user-generated content unit based on the social media document view introduced in Chapter 3.4. The calculation of a ranking that is applicable to all types of user-generated content is proposed in Section 5.2. The example calculation in Chapter 5.3 illustrates the application of the proposed ranking approach by means of user-generated content units from diﬀerent social media categories.  5.1 Five Scores Reﬂecting the Social Media  Document View  Looking for a solution that solves both, allowing to include more in- formation than what is common for all user-generated content units  i.e., publishing date, author, and source , while maintaining compar- ability, approaches from other disciplines were evaluated. Encapsula- tion and information hiding are concepts known from object-oriented software construction  Meyer, 1997 . Those are the two fundamental aspects of abstraction in software engineering. Abstraction is the  1Patent pending.  C. Wyrwoll, Social Media, DOI 10.1007 978-3-658-06984-1_5,   Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden 2014   102  5 A Cross-Platform Ranking Approach  process of identifying the essential aspects of an entity while ignor- ing unimportant details. Encapsulation describes a construction that facilitates the bundling of data. The concept of information hiding means that external aspects of an object are separated from its in- ternal details. These concepts simplify the construction and mainten- ance of software with the help of modularization. An object is a black box that can be constructed and modiﬁed independently  Connolly & Begg, 2005, p. 814 .  These generic concepts shall serve as inspiration to solve the problem at hand. The measures from diﬀerent social media platforms diﬀer in speciﬁcation and target set of a function. Nevertheless, they hold important information that allows to be more precise about the docu- ment they belong to.  A user-generated document can be represented as a vector of its properties. The vector notation has been chosen because it is a compact notation suitable for further numerical processing. Let D = {d1, . . . , dm} be a set of social media documents and P  di  =  p1 di , . . . , pn di   be the vector of properties for di.  To compare diﬀerent measures from diﬀerent categories, one possible solution could be to ﬁnd correspondent measures throughout the cat- egories. One major drawback of this approach is that there are a lot of measures that do not have correspondents throughout all other cat- egories. Thus, this solution cannot include all information available for all platforms. Furthermore, it involves thorough understanding of platforms to map correspondent measures. Moreover, this has to be done manually. Consequently, this approach does not allow to ﬂexibly and quickly add new platforms.  Another solution is to develop a number of abstract concepts that unite several per se incomparable measures into one aggregated meas- ure, which then allows comparison. Abstraction levels should have semantic correspondents and be category-independent. Diﬀerent fea- tures from diﬀerent categories are combined in a way that they ex- press the same fact for each category. After normalization of the   5.1 Five Scores Reﬂecting the Social Media Document View  103  co-domains, diﬀerent aspects become comparable throughout all so- cial media categories. The abstraction levels are individually com- posed modules, but the modeled aspects are comparable between social media categories. The result is a vector  R di  =  r1 di , . . . , r cid:3   a di     5.1   where a ≤ n and a is constant. R di  holds a ﬁxed number of proper- ties rj of the social media document di. The rj di  are derived from one or more properties pi di .  The social media cross-category comparison shows that there are a few measures that occur in every category. Namely those are pub- lishing date, author, and source. All other features are speciﬁc for a certain category or platform  e.g., number of retweets . For some features and categories semantic analogues can be found. Followers in a microblogging service like Twitter are very similar to the being in the circles of that can be found in some social networks.  The number of properties depends on the number of measures that can be retrieved for a social media document. The number of meas- ures that can be retrieved depends on the measures a platform oﬀers and in some cases  e.g., author-related information  on the informa- tion provided by the user of the platform. Hence, the dimension n of the property vector P  di  =  p1 di , . . . , pn di   diﬀers.  To identify a ﬁxed number of abstract concepts that have semantic correspondents throughout all categories, the measures collected in Section 3.1 need to be examined for similarities. This has been done in Section 3.2. The resulting social media document view holds the common ground for user-generated content of all types.  The identiﬁed elements of the social media document view each serve as the semantic layer of abstract concepts that unite several per se incomparable measures each into one aggregated measure which then allows comparison.   104  5 A Cross-Platform Ranking Approach  The identiﬁed elements of the social media document view are:   author-related information,    source-related information,   intrinsic information and   extrinsic information.  The publishing date belongs to the extrinsic information of a docu- ment and is also available for all user-generated content units. Let D = {d1, . . . , dm} be a set of user-generated content units and P  di  =  p1 di , . . . , pn di   be the properties for di. The properties P  di  =  p1 di , . . . , pn di   hold the following: p1 di , . . ., ph−1 di  are all author related measures of di, ph di , . . ., pk−1 di  are all source related measures of di, pk di , . . ., pm−1 di  are all intrinsic measures of di, pm di , . . ., pn−1 di  are all extrinsic measures of di, and pn di  is the publishing date of di. Now we can derive a vector R di  =  r1 di , . . . , r5 di   that holds a ﬁxed number of properties of the social media document di with the following dimensions: ⎞ ⎛ ⎝r1 di  ⎠ = r5 di   ⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝  ⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠   5.2   ⎛  ⎞  . . .  rauthor di  rsource di  rintrinsic di  rextrinsic di  rrecency di   R di  is the social media document vector. r1, . . . , r5 being ab- stract concepts of the user-generated content unit di.

Figure 5.1 shows how the proposed social media document view relates to the derived social media document vector that holds a ﬁxed number of properties of the social media document di.   cid:8  cid:31  cid:30  cid:20  cid:26  cid:28  cid:5  cid:28  cid:18  cid:23  cid:14  cid:30  cid:18  cid:17  cid:1    cid:24  cid:18  cid:14  cid:29  cid:31  cid:28  cid:18  cid:29  cid:1  cid:1    cid:2  cid:27  cid:7  cid:2  cid:17  cid:21  cid:3  cid:4  cid:1  cid:34  cid:1  cid:4  cid:1  cid:27  cid:20  cid:5  cid:7  cid:2  cid:17  cid:21  cid:3  cid:3  cid:1  cid:1    cid:13  cid:26  cid:31  cid:28  cid:16  cid:18  cid:5  cid:28  cid:18  cid:23  cid:14  cid:30  cid:18  cid:17  cid:1    cid:24  cid:18  cid:14  cid:29  cid:31  cid:28  cid:18  cid:29  cid:1    cid:2  cid:27  cid:20  cid:2  cid:17  cid:21  cid:3  cid:4  cid:1  cid:6  cid:1  cid:6  cid:1  cid:6  cid:4  cid:1  cid:27  cid:22  cid:5  cid:7  cid:2  cid:17  cid:21  cid:3  cid:3  cid:1  cid:1    cid:10  cid:25  cid:30  cid:28  cid:21  cid:25  cid:29  cid:21  cid:16  cid:1  cid:24  cid:18  cid:14  cid:29  cid:31  cid:28  cid:18  cid:29  cid:1   cid:2  cid:27  cid:22  cid:2  cid:17  cid:21  cid:3  cid:4  cid:1  cid:6  cid:1  cid:6  cid:1  cid:6  cid:4  cid:1  cid:27  cid:24  cid:5  cid:7  cid:2  cid:17  cid:21  cid:3  cid:3  cid:1    cid:9  cid:32  cid:30  cid:28  cid:21  cid:25  cid:29  cid:21  cid:16  cid:1  cid:24  cid:18  cid:14  cid:29  cid:31  cid:28  cid:18  cid:29  cid:1   cid:2  cid:27  cid:24  cid:2  cid:17  cid:21  cid:3  cid:4  cid:1  cid:6  cid:1  cid:6  cid:1  cid:6  cid:4  cid:1  cid:27  cid:25  cid:5  cid:7  cid:2  cid:17  cid:21  cid:3  cid:3  cid:1    cid:11  cid:31  cid:15  cid:23  cid:21  cid:29  cid:20  cid:21  cid:25  cid:19  cid:1  cid:17  cid:14  cid:30  cid:18  cid:1    cid:2  cid:27  cid:25  cid:2  cid:17  cid:21  cid:3  cid:3  cid:1    cid:8  cid:31  cid:30  cid:20  cid:26  cid:28  cid:1  cid:29  cid:16  cid:26  cid:28  cid:18  cid:1    cid:13  cid:26  cid:31  cid:28  cid:16  cid:18  cid:1  cid:29  cid:16  cid:26  cid:28  cid:18  cid:1    cid:10  cid:25  cid:30  cid:28  cid:21  cid:25  cid:29  cid:21  cid:16  cid:1  cid:29  cid:16  cid:26  cid:28  cid:18  cid:1    cid:9  cid:32  cid:30  cid:28  cid:21  cid:25  cid:29  cid:21  cid:16  cid:1  cid:29  cid:16  cid:26  cid:28  cid:18  cid:1    cid:12  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:25  cid:16  cid:33  cid:1   Figure 5.1: From the social media document view to the social  media document vector. The social media document vector comprises ﬁve scores. The author score is derived from author-related measures, the source-score is based on source-related measures, intrinsic measures constitute the intrinsic document score, extrinsic measures are the basis for the extrinsic score and recency is derived from the publishing date.  Each score belongs to a document and can be mapped to one single value, the ranking is based on. At the same time it is possible to maintain the scores separate in order to be able to easily adjust the weight of the scores. With regards to the code of conduct no. 3, the   106  5 A Cross-Platform Ranking Approach  levels of abstraction are modeled in a way that they are comprehens- ible for the user. This way it is possible to provide the user with an interface that allows him to factorize diﬀerent dimensions according to his needs. The framework proposed here also allows to include or exclude properties and adjust the way they contribute to the ranking, if desired. The author score rauthor di  adapts known concepts described in Subsection 3.3.1 for social media. It is composed by all metadata about the author of a user-generated content unit that allow to draw conclusions about the author. The basic assumptions are that the more an author is cited, the longer he or she is member of the com- munity, the more contributions he or she has published, the higher his connectivity in the community  e.g., number of friends , the more positive peer ratings an author received  e.g., number of likes , and the more information the author voluntarily reveals about himself, the higher is the author’s reputation. The source score rsource di  adapts known concepts described in Subsection 3.3.2 for social media. It is derived from metadata about the source where di is published. The conclusions that can be drawn from a social media source are deduced from the information that can be assessed about a source. The size of a community can be meas- ured by the number of members. The size of a community indicates the potential reach of a user-generated content unit. For example, a message being shared through Twitter—a platform that has 200 mil- lion active users  Wickre, 2013 —has a higher potential reach than a message published in a small forum that has 5,000 members. The number of incoming links is an indicator of the popularity of a source. This measure is also used as central element of the PageRank  Page et al., 1998 . Hence, the size of the source and number of references to it will be rewarded. The intrinsic score rintrinsic di  allows to include content-derived features into the ranking. Several conclusions about the content can be conducted from consuming the content itself. The properties, that   5.1 Five Scores Reﬂecting the Social Media Document View  107  can be gained by a computer analysis, are limited compared to human capabilities. User-generated content can consist of texts, pictures, video and audio ﬁles or a mixture of them. Often, also nontext multi- media content is accompanied by descriptive text. Content-derived features for audio and video content is left to further research. If the content is or contains text, indicators can be gained by text analysis. Text mining is a lively ﬁeld of research that oﬀers many approaches of diﬀerent levels of sophistication. Generally, the framework proposed here is open to several solutions. With respect to the desired language- independence, the features proposed here are language-independent. If the approach presented here is applied to content written in a single language only, a more sophisticated language-dependent approach could also be applied. The following are proposals for features that can be easily derived from texts.  The proposed features are meant to be a starting point that can be extended and further developed to more sophisticated levels. The modularity of the proposed framework also allows to neglect single scores such as the intrinsic score of social media documents com- pletely. From studies presented in Subsection 3.3.3, it can be con- cluded that references contribute to text credibility. Consequently, references will be awarded. Furthermore, text length has shown to be an eﬃcient indicator for text quality. The number of sentences, the number of words per sentence and the number of questions can also be used as features. The extrinsic score rextrinsic di  captures the assessments of user- generated content units described in Subsection 3.3.4. A social media document is part of a lively dynamic system, driven by interactions between users and content, enabled through social media platforms as recommendations, shares, likes, and so on. Every interaction with a user-generated content unit contains information about its poten- tial relevance for users that have already consumed a piece of content. That allows to predict the relative probability that a piece of content will be interesting for others. The concept of the extrinsic score is the advancement of the traditional word-of-mouth concept combined   108  5 A Cross-Platform Ranking Approach  with the wisdom of the crowds concept. The collection of all user interactions with a content unit —whether something is read, com- mented, recommended, shared or liked—is a crowd sourced assess- ment of the content unit that can serve as recommendation for other users. The extrinsic score is derived from the additional information available on document level. Most of these features are produced by implicit or explicit peer evaluation. Explicit peer evaluations are one click ratings such as likes on Facebook, +1 on Google+, or thumbs up on Youtube. Shares on Facebook and Twitter are also a kind of explicit peer evaluation. Comments are also a kind of peer evaluation. In the content of the comment users explicitly express their opinion, but implicitly with each comment users show that the content unit was worth spending the time to write the comment. So, whether an explicitly expressed opinion is positive or negative, implicitly every comment shows that the content that is commented on is somehow important. Consequently, the number of comments is also a feature indicating relevance. In forums, it is number of hits and the size of a thread by number of replies to a root-posting that indicate the relevance of a topic and a root posting. In blogs, the number of com- ments per entry shows how much attention a social media document received. The number of links to a blog post, also referred to as track-backs, reveals how often a blog post has been shared and thus recommended. Nowadays, blogs often integrate other social media platforms as plug-ins. Consequently, there can be Facebook likes, +1s, and other peer ratings also for blog posts. Those are indicators for relevance as well and are integrated into the extrinsic score. In microblogs such as Twitter the same mechanisms can be found. If a social tweet is recommended, it is counted as retweet and if it is liked, it is counted as favorite.  Recency is a well-known concept for the user. It is the time that has passed between the publication of a piece of content and its con- sumption by a user. The less time has passed, the more recent is the user-generated content unit. Even though a lot of user-generated content units are time-dependent and more relevant if they are new,   5.2 Cross-Platform Compatibility Creates Comparability  109  this can not be generalized. Consequently, I propose to reward newer content units and to allow the user to adapt recency according to his needs.  5.2 Cross-Platform Compatibility Creates  Comparability  To start the calculation of the relevance score, we begin with a set of documents. It is assumed that the documents have been crawled and stored into a database. All dates have already been converted into the same format  e.g., dd-tt-yyyy . Text quality measures have been extracted from the text. Semantically corresponding properties have the same key reference, also referred to as label. For example, publish- ing date is always referenced as publishing date, and not sometimes as date of publication and other times as date. This can be done either on a basic level or it can contain a semantic mapping. For example, hits can be mapped to views, if desired. P  di  is a map that holds then properties pj, j = 1 . . . n of document di as tuples of key and value  keyj di , valuej  di  , j = 1 . . . n:  key1 di , value1 di  , . . .,  keyh−1 di , valueh−1 di  : author-related information,  keyh di , valueh di  , . . .,  keyk−1 di , valuek−1 di  : information,  keyk di , valuek di  , . . .,  keym−1 di , valuem−1 di  : formation,  keym di , valuem di  , . . .,  keyn−1 di , valuen−1 di  : formation, and  keyn di , valuen di  : publishing date.  source-related  extrinsic in-  intrinsic in-  Each ﬁeld holds a record with the type of information as key and the value  e.g., key=hometown, value=Vancouver .   110  5 A Cross-Platform Ranking Approach  Step 1: Preprocessing  Each property map originally holds information of diﬀerent types. Such are numeric values such as hits=100 as well as strings such as hometown=Vancouver. The ﬁrst step maps the nonnumerical inform- ation to numerical values. There are several possible solutions how this can be achieved. Finding the best way is a trade-of between in- formation quality and processing eﬃciency. This question should be evaluated separately, and is not part of this thesis. In the following, one possible solution is introduced.  Studies suggest that the more information an author reveals about himself, the more trustworthy he is regarded  Fogg & Tseng, 1999; Fogg et al., 2000, 2001, 2003; Tseng & Fogg, 1999 . Hence, I propose to approximate the users assessment by mapping nonnumerical au- thor related properties such as age, hometown, hobbies, job, and so on, to one numerical value as number of further information given. This can be achieved by summing the additional information given as a weighted or nonweighted sum, without taking its value into account. On the one hand, a disadvantage of this approach is that it does not take into account if the further information given has any reference to the context of the content the author produced. For example, if a social media document is posted within a forum with a medical focus topic it might make a diﬀerence to the reader, if the author claims he is a physician or an undertaker. The approach does not make this distinction. On the other hand, the advantage of the approach is that it is ﬂexible and easily transferable to the variety of author proﬁles of the diﬀerent social media platforms. Also, topic identiﬁcation as well as the mapping of the correspondences between the identiﬁed topic and the author information given is not a trivial task. Furthermore, the proposed approach needs less processing time.  Source related properties do not contain nonnumerical properties. In- trinsic and extrinsic properties are available as numerical values as well. Recency is derived from the publishing date.   5.2 Cross-Platform Compatibility Creates Comparability  111  Step 2: Normalization  For each key the value is normalized with respect to the known max- imum. To do that, a comparison map CM is created that holds all keys and their maxima. Each new document is then compared with CM . If a new document holds a property that is not part of CM , CM is updated and the new property is added along with its value as ﬁrst maximum. If the key is already part of the map, its value is looked up and compared with the new value. If the new value is higher than the prevalent value in CM , the value is reassigned to the key. Next, all the values of the document are normalized with respect to CM . The normalization is based on the achieved maximum of each property. This means that each property is measured in terms of its performance with respect to the global range of this property. This relates the values of the properties of a single user-generated content unit to the values of the properties of other content units. Altern- atively, values could be normalized by the average value instead of the maximum value. The average has to be calculated whereas the maximum can be gained by just comparing a new value to the current maximum. Hence, using the maximum is more eﬃcient.   112  5 A Cross-Platform Ranking Approach  initialize empty map CM ; for all documents di, i=1:m do  for all properties pj, j=1:n ofd i do  if CM contains keyj di  then  if value CM.keyj  < valuej di  then set value CM.keyj  = valuej di   end  else  end  end  add pj to CM  end for all documents di, i=1:m do  create empty P  cid:3  di  that will hold the normalized values for di; for all properties pj, j=1:n ofd i do  set key cid:3  set value cid:3   j di  = keyj di ;  j di  = value keyj  di   ÷ value CM.keyj   end  end  Step 3: Aggregation  For each document a new array is created that holds the ﬁve docu- ment scores. The aggregation is based on the average performance of the properties.   5.2 Cross-Platform Compatibility Creates Comparability  113  for all documents i=1:m do  for all properties pj, j=1:h-1 ofd i do  calculate the average of author related properties pj di   end for all properties pj, j=h:k-1 of di do  calculate the average of source related properties pj di   end for all properties pj, j=k:m-1 of di do  calculate the average of intrinsic properties pj di   end for all properties pj, j=m:n-1 ofd i do  calculate the average of extrinsic properties pj di   calculate recency by the reciprocal of the time diﬀerence between publishing time of di and processing time  end for j=n do  end  end  Step 4: Reduction to one score  For each document the ﬁve scores can now be mapped to one score. A simple approach is to calculate the length of the vector weighing all ﬁve scores equally. Alternatively, the euclidean norm could be used, which requires fewer resources for its calculation.  Separability of the Dataset to be Ranked and the Normalization  The proposed approach can be applied to large sets of user-generated content as well as to small subsets. The values for the map CM that are used to normalize measures are proposed to be gathered from the set of content units for which the scores are calculated. Altern- atively, the values in map CM used to normalize measures can also be gathered from a diﬀerent, larger set than the set for which the   114  5 A Cross-Platform Ranking Approach  scores are calculated. For example, if resources are limited, the set of user-generated content units that are ranked can be limited but still be measured in relation to values gained from a larger set of content units. The map CM could even contain manually researched maximum values.  5.3 An Example Case for Forums and Media  Sharing Platforms  The following example calculation shall illustrate the method de- scribed in the previous section for user-generated content units from diﬀerent social media categories. The content units are randomly se- lected from three diﬀerent forums, and two diﬀerent media sharing sites. The categories were chosen to demonstrate the range of con- tent units and their metadata. The examples chosen diﬀer in type and number of metadata. Furthermore, they diﬀer in the type of con- tent they contain. User-generated content units from forums contain text, whereas user-generated content units from media sharing sites contain photos or videos.  Table 5.1 shows the metadata for user-generated content units from three diﬀerent forums and two diﬀerent media sharing platforms. Ex- ample number 1 is from forum.runnersworld.de,2 example num- ber 2 is from www.laufforum.de,3 example number 3 is from www. apfeltalk.de,4 and example number 4 is from www.apfeltalk.de5 as well, example number 5 is from www.flickr.com,6 example num- ber 6 is also from www.flickr.com,7 example number 7 is from  2http:  forum.runnersworld.de forum trainingsplanung-fuer-marathon   33367-mit-greif-durchs-trainingsjahr.html  3http:  www.laufforum.de immer-noch-kein-speed-87509.html 4http:  www.apfeltalk.de forum macbook-pro-15-a-t410209.html 5http:  www.apfeltalk.de forum showthread.php?t=109921 6http:  www.flickr.com photos 28252015@N00 3199464411  7http:  www.flickr.com photos 36755776@N07 7780251000    5.3 An Example Case for Forums and Media Sharing Platforms 115  www.youtube.com,8 and example number 8 is from www.youtube. com9 as well.  The ﬁrst column of Table 5.1 shows the type of metadata referenced by their labels. The subsequent columns show their values in the diﬀerent examples. The metadata for examples 1–4 diﬀer from the metadata for examples 5–8. For example, the user-generated con- tent units from Flickr and Youtube have  likes, whereas the user- generated content units from the forums do not. Intrinsic measures, that give indications about the quality of the content, derived from the content have been introduced for texts only. Intrinsic measures for multi-media content such as photos and videos are left to further research.  Information about back-links have been gathered from Google. There are also alternative sources for back-links  e.g., Alexa10 .  Some metadata are diﬀerently labeled, but have the same meaning. Some metadata do not have the same but similar meanings. De- pending on the desired precision, it is suitable to map those to one metadatum. In the example at hand, some metadata have been se- mantically mapped. Originally, there are number of replies for a forum’s content unit and number of comments for a media sharing platform’s content unit. It is a matter of choice whether to inter- pret them as expressing the same information or to interpret them as expressing diﬀerent information. If diﬀerently labeled metadata are interpreted to have the same meaning, they can be mapped to one label. If diﬀerently labeled metadata are interpreted to have dif- ferent meanings, diﬀerent labels should be kept. Here, number of replies of a forum’s content unit and number of comments of a media sharing content unit have been both mapped to number of replies. Furthermore, hits from forums and views from media sharing plat- forms have been both mapped to hits. In some cases, it can make  8http:  www.youtube.com watch?v=5HHnDEnsdno 9http:  www.youtube.com watch?v=GEKgYKpEJ3o 10http:  www.alexa.com faqs ?p=91   116  5 A Cross-Platform Ranking Approach  Table

Hits usually indicate that the user-generated content unit has been clicked on, whereas views indicate that the user-generated content unit has been consumed for at least a short time.  Then, the maxima of all metadata are gathered as described in Sec- tion 5.2, page 111. It holds all occurring types of metadata and the current maximum values as Table 5.2 shows. Dates such as member since and publishing date have been mapped to a numerical value. In the example given, the maximum value for member since has been calculated as diﬀerence in days between the oldest membership and a reference date. Alternatively, it would also be feasible to set a bin- ary value, to diﬀerentiate only the new memberships and not new memberships.  The maximum value for publishing date has been calculated as dif- ference in days between the newest publishing date and a reference date. The retrieval date served as reference date.  Table 5.2 shows the results of the calculation. When new documents are added, the map of maxima has to be updated regularly. When it changes, the scores for the content units have to be updated as well.  Then, the values of the metadata are normalized with respect to the maxima. The recency of a user-generated content unit r dk  is calculated as the smallest diﬀerence between a reference date and the publishing date of the user-generated content units di, i = 1 . . . ..8 and the diﬀerence between the publishing date of dk and the reference date: r dk  =  min Δdi  Δdk. The calculation of recency applied here has an exemplary character. Other methods to derive a recency factor from a publishing date can be applied as well. The choice of the method depends on which distribution for recency is desired and the resources that are available for calculation. Table 5.3 shows the results. All numbers are rounded to three digits after the decimal point.  Then the author score, source score, intrinsic score, extrinsic score, and recency are calculated.

Table 5.4 shows the results.  Finally, the resulting scores are calculated. There are several options to map the ﬁve scores to one. The euclidean norm is one option. In the example given, the arithmetic mean is used. Table 5.5 shows the results. The euclidean norm requires the calculation of the square- root of the sum of the square of all ﬁve dimensions, whereas the arithmetic mean only requires the calculation of the sum divided by the number of summands. For large data sets, the arithmetic means might be preferable because it requires less complex calculations. The determination of the optimal solution depends on the application and is left to further research.   5.3 An Example Case for Forums and Media Sharing Platforms 119  Table 5.3: Metadata of examples

Sharing Platforms 121  Figure 5.2 shows screen-shots of the three user-generated content units with the highest scores. The user-generated content unit with the highest score of the eight examples is a video on Youtube by Mum- fordandSons. MumfordandSons is the band who plays in the video of example 7. It is a relatively popular band and it is the band’s own Youtube-account. This is rewarded with the author-related meas- ure realname. MumfordandSons has the highest author score. The second ranked is also a video on Youtube. It is a video of the song Hey Jude by The Beatles. It has been watched 7,542,870 times. This is reﬂected in the highest extrinsic score. The user-generated con- tent unit with the third highest score is a thread in a runner’s forum. The second highest author score receives a thread in a runner’s forum where Chri.S shares his experiences with his training and gives advice to other runners. Chri.S is an experienced runner and an active user of the forum. In six years of membership he wrote 4,734 contributions in the runner’s forum. His high author score reﬂects this. The ex- ample case demonstrates how the proposed approach can be applied to user-generated content units from diﬀerent platforms of diﬀerent social media categories. It shows the ﬁve scoring dimensions and il- lustrates how they can be evaluated separately or as one aggregated score.   122  5 A Cross-Platform Ranking Approach   cid:7    cid:0    cid:2   Figure 5.2: The three user-generated content units of the ex-  ample case with the highest ranks. The video on Youtube by Mumford & Sons scored highest of the eight user-generated content unit in the example. Even though it has lesser views than the second ranked video the overall score is higher because of its high author score. The high author score of the Mumford & Sons video results from that the video has been posted by the band Mumford & Sons themselves.   6 Applications  Looking at interactive software from a radically diﬀerent, user-centered perspective is a necessary step in a rapidly changing networked, socially determined information world that connects increasing numbers of persons in manifold ways.  Horst Oberquelle  2002, p. 405   The query-independent ranking method presented in the previous chapter can be used in a variety of applications. First of all, it can be applied in a discovery engine for user-generated content. Secondly, in combination with a query-dependent ranking it can be applied in a search engine specialized for user-generated content. Thirdly, the proposed ranking approach can be applied to rank any set of user-generated content units. For example it could be used to rank a set of user-generated content units that are part of a social media monitoring tool. Furthermore, the presented approach can be applied to all types of documents, for which metadata is available that allows to determine an author score, a source score, an intrinsic score, an extrinsic score and a recency score. If information that is required for one of the scores is missing, the ranking can be based on the remaining subset of scores. If, for example, there is no information about the source of a set of documents, the ranking can be based on author- related information, intrinsic information, extrinsic information, and recency.

Wyrwoll, Social Media, DOI 10.1007 978-3-658-06984-1_6,   Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden 2014   124  6 Applications  The following chapter presents a concept of a discovery engine for user-generated content in Section 6.1 and a search engine for user- generated content in Section 6.2, as examples for applications of the proposed query-independent ranking approach.  Prior to further processing, content usually needs to be obtained from social media platforms and stored in a database. Figure 6.1 schemat- ically illustrates the main steps.   cid:4  cid:17  cid:8  cid:13  cid:6  cid:14  cid:1  cid:15  cid:10  cid:9  cid:13  cid:6  cid:1   cid:18  cid:14  cid:6  cid:21  cid:11  cid:17  cid:19  cid:15  cid:20    cid:2  cid:6  cid:21  cid:6  cid:1  cid:10  cid:23  cid:21  cid:19  cid:6  cid:8  cid:21  cid:13  cid:17  cid:16    cid:2  cid:6  cid:21  cid:6  cid:7  cid:6  cid:20  cid:10  cid:1  cid:17  cid:11   cid:1    cid:22  cid:20  cid:10  cid:19  cid:1    cid:12  cid:10  cid:16  cid:10  cid:19  cid:6  cid:21  cid:10  cid:9  cid:1   cid:8  cid:17  cid:16  cid:21  cid:10  cid:16  cid:21  cid:1  cid:22  cid:16  cid:13  cid:21  cid:20    cid:5  cid:20  cid:10  cid:19  cid:1  cid:13  cid:16  cid:21  cid:10  cid:19  cid:11  cid:6  cid:8  cid:10    cid:2  cid:6  cid:21  cid:6  cid:7  cid:6  cid:20  cid:10  cid:1  cid:17  cid:11   cid:1    cid:19  cid:10  cid:20  cid:22  cid:14  cid:21  cid:20    cid:3  cid:19  cid:17  cid:8  cid:10  cid:20  cid:20  cid:13  cid:16  cid:12   Figure 6.1: Flowchart of how information is obtained from social  media platforms for availability in a user interface. The data extraction process collects user-generated content units and their metadata from social media platforms and stores them in a database. Then, the content units can be processed  e.g., query-independent ranking . The results are stored and can be delivered for display in a user interface.   6.1 A Discovery Engine for User-Generated Content  125  6.1 A Discovery Engine for User-Generated  Content  The proposed ranking approach allows to rank user-generated content units from diﬀerent platforms independent of a search query. It can be applied in a discovery engine that provides users with the content units that have the highest score of all evaluated content units.   cid:16  cid:25  cid:25  cid:22  cid:5  cid:4  cid:4

example application for the proposed query- independent ranking approach. The main area of the screen shows user-generated content units in the order of their rank. The weight of the ﬁve scores can be adjusted by the user according to his interests and information needs.   126  6 Applications  Figure 6.2 shows a wireframe of the proposed concept. The main area in the center shows user-generated content units from diﬀerent platforms. The user-generated content units are displayed in the order of their rank based on the ﬁve scores. Figure 6.3 speciﬁes in detail the presentation of content units. The more user-generated content units the discovery engine evaluates, the worthier are the results. Ideally, the discovery engine covers all public user-generated content units.  The discovery engine for user-generated content enables exploratory search and is suited for users with feature-related information needs, who do not search for a speciﬁc topic or search term and do not have an exact idea of what they want to ﬁnd. A user who seeks the best scoring content units could explore the content units displayed by the discovery engine in the order of their overall score. Users could use the discovery engine to look for inspiration, for something new, or for what is going on in the world. Users can visit the discovery engine to discover what people share, comment on and like world wide.  Due to the platform comparability users get the results for various platforms. Consequently, they do not longer need to know which platforms are most relevant and they do not need to know beforehand which authors are most active and most recommended.  Additionally, the user could be provided with a possibility to ma- nipulate the weight of the scores according to his interests. In the example shown, the author score is labeled Author, the source score is labeled Source, the intrinsic score is labeled Content, the extrinsic score is labeled Popularity, and the recency score is labeled Recency. The labels have been chosen to indicate the meaning of the scores. For example, if a user is interested in the highest scoring sources, he could set the source score to 100 percent, thus setting all other scores to zero and browse through the results. If he is interested in the most active and most recommended authors, he could set the author score to 100 percent, thus setting all other scores to zero and browse through the results.   6.1 A Discovery Engine for User-Generated Content  127   cid:7  cid:15  cid:24  cid:26  cid:19  cid:25  cid:1  cid:24  cid:13  cid:22  cid:23  cid:15    cid:8  cid:22  cid:26  cid:23  cid:13  cid:15  cid:1  cid:24  cid:13  cid:22  cid:23  cid:15    cid:6  cid:26  cid:12  cid:19  cid:18  cid:24  cid:17  cid:18  cid:21  cid:16  cid:1  cid:14  cid:11  cid:25  cid:15    cid:2  cid:26  cid:25  cid:17  cid:22  cid:23  cid:1  cid:24  cid:13  cid:22  cid:23  cid:15    cid:8  cid:22  cid:26  cid:23  cid:13  cid:15  cid:1  cid:10  cid:7  cid:5   cid:2  cid:26  cid:25  cid:17  cid:22  cid:23   cid:9  cid:18  cid:25  cid:19  cid:15    cid:3  cid:22  cid:21  cid:25  cid:15  cid:21  cid:25    cid:19  cid:44  cid:35  cid:46  cid:1  cid:7  cid:13  cid:4  cid:1  cid:8  cid:6  cid:7  cid:9    cid:24  cid:38  cid:44  cid:41  cid:27  cid:29  cid:5  cid:27  cid:38  cid:36  cid:1  cid:2  cid:6  cid:5  cid:6  cid:7  cid:3   cid:39  cid:44  cid:26  cid:35  cid:33  cid:42  cid:32  cid:29  cid:28  cid:1  cid:26  cid:46  cid:1  cid:16  cid:32  cid:41  cid:33  cid:42  cid:13  cid:6  cid:1  cid:2  cid:6  cid:5  cid:11  cid:12  cid:3   cid:9  cid:14  cid:16  cid:11  cid:17  cid:1  cid:8  cid:15  cid:17  cid:18  cid:13  cid:1  cid:10  cid:14  cid:12  cid:14  cid:16  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:2  cid:5  cid:4  cid:6  cid:7  cid:3   cid:20  cid:38  cid:41  cid:29  cid:36  cid:1  cid:33  cid:39  cid:42  cid:44  cid:36  cid:1  cid:28  cid:38  cid:35  cid:38  cid:41  cid:1  cid:42  cid:33  cid:43  cid:1  cid:25  cid:36  cid:29  cid:43  cid:4  cid:1  cid:27  cid:38  cid:37  cid:42  cid:29  cid:27  cid:43  cid:29  cid:43  cid:44  cid:29  cid:41  cid:1  cid:25  cid:28  cid:33  cid:39  cid:33  cid:42  cid:27  cid:33  cid:37  cid:31  cid:1  cid:29  cid:35  cid:33  cid:43  cid:5  cid:1   cid:15  cid:29  cid:37  cid:29  cid:25  cid:37  cid:1  cid:27  cid:38  cid:36  cid:36  cid:38  cid:28  cid:38  cid:1  cid:35  cid:33  cid:31  cid:44  cid:35  cid:25  cid:1  cid:29  cid:31  cid:29  cid:43  cid:1  cid:28  cid:38  cid:35  cid:38  cid:41  cid:5  cid:1  cid:15  cid:29  cid:37  cid:29  cid:25  cid:37  cid:1  cid:36  cid:25  cid:42  cid:42  cid:25  cid:5  cid:1  cid:16  cid:44  cid:36  cid:1   cid:42  cid:38  cid:27  cid:33  cid:33  cid:42  cid:1  cid:37  cid:25  cid:43  cid:38  cid:40  cid:44  cid:29  cid:1  cid:39  cid:29  cid:37  cid:25  cid:43  cid:33  cid:26  cid:44  cid:42  cid:1  cid:29  cid:43  cid:1  cid:36  cid:25  cid:31  cid:37  cid:33  cid:42  cid:1  cid:28  cid:33  cid:42  cid:1  cid:39  cid:25  cid:41  cid:43  cid:44  cid:41  cid:33  cid:29  cid:37  cid:43  cid:1   cid:36  cid:38  cid:37  cid:43  cid:29  cid:42  cid:4  cid:1  cid:37  cid:25  cid:42  cid:27  cid:29  cid:43  cid:44  cid:41  cid:1  cid:41  cid:33  cid:28  cid:33  cid:27  cid:44  cid:35  cid:44  cid:42  cid:1  cid:36  cid:44  cid:42  cid:5  cid:1  cid:17  cid:38  cid:37  cid:29  cid:27  cid:1  cid:40  cid:44  cid:25  cid:36  cid:1  cid:30  cid:29  cid:35  cid:33  cid:42  cid:4  cid:1   cid:44  cid:35  cid:43  cid:41  cid:33  cid:27  cid:33  cid:29  cid:42  cid:1  cid:37  cid:29  cid:27  cid:4  cid:1  cid:39  cid:29  cid:35  cid:35  cid:29  cid:37  cid:43  cid:29  cid:42  cid:40  cid:44  cid:29  cid:1  cid:29  cid:44  cid:4  cid:1  cid:39  cid:41  cid:29  cid:43  cid:33  cid:44  cid:36  cid:1  cid:40  cid:44  cid:33  cid:42  cid:4  cid:1  cid:42  cid:29  cid:36  cid:5  cid:1  cid:17  cid:38  cid:37  cid:29  cid:27  cid:1   cid:39  cid:29  cid:28  cid:29  cid:1  cid:34  cid:44  cid:42  cid:43  cid:38  cid:4  cid:1  cid:30  cid:41  cid:33  cid:37  cid:31  cid:33  cid:35  cid:35  cid:25  cid:1  cid:45  cid:29  cid:35  cid:4  cid:1  cid:25  cid:35  cid:33  cid:40  cid:44  cid:29  cid:43  cid:1  cid:37  cid:29  cid:27  cid:4  cid:1  cid:45  cid:44  cid:35  cid:39  cid:44  cid:43  cid:25  cid:43  cid:29  cid:1  cid:29  cid:31  cid:29  cid:43  cid:4  cid:1  cid:25  cid:41  cid:27  cid:44  cid:5    cid:4  cid:27  cid:25  cid:23  cid:18  cid:21  cid:24  cid:18  cid:13  cid:1  cid:24  cid:13  cid:22  cid:23  cid:15   cid:4  cid:27  cid:25  cid:23  cid:18  cid:21  cid:24  cid:18  cid:13  cid:1  cid:20  cid:15  cid:11  cid:24  cid:26  cid:23  cid:15  cid:24    cid:22  cid:38  cid:39  cid:44  cid:35  cid:25  cid:41  cid:33  cid:43  cid:46  cid:1  cid:2  cid:6  cid:5  cid:9  cid:13  cid:3   cid:14  cid:4  cid:10  cid:11  cid:12  cid:1  cid:23  cid:29  cid:39  cid:35  cid:33  cid:29  cid:42   cid:7  cid:1  cid:21  cid:33  cid:38  cid:5  cid:1  cid:18  cid:33  cid:43  cid:42   Figure 6.3: Key to ranked user-generated content units.  The content of a content unit is displayed in the central area. At the top, the source URL and its source score is displayed along with the publishing date. Below this, the author and the author score is given. Directly above the content, the title of the contribution is provided. Next to the title the result score is visualized by stars. The result score is also provided in numerical form. At the bottom the extrinsic score is displayed as popularity. Below the extrinsic score, the extrinsic measures that led to the extrinsic score are provided. The triangle next to Popularity indicates that measures can be displayed or hidden as desired.  The features used in the proposed query-independent ranking ap- proach are all language-independent. It is therefore possible to apply it to content units of diﬀerent languages. Provided that content units are separable by language,1 it would also be possible to ﬁlter content units by language and to compare results from diﬀerent languages.  1For example, content could be tagged during the data extraction process.   128  6 Applications   cid:8  cid:22  cid:26  cid:23  cid:13  cid:15  cid:1  cid:24  cid:13  cid:22  cid:23  cid:15    cid:6  cid:26  cid:12  cid:19  cid:18  cid:24  cid:17  cid:18  cid:21  cid:16  cid:1  cid:14  cid:11  cid:25  cid:15    cid:2  cid:26  cid:25  cid:17  cid:22  cid:23  cid:1  cid:24  cid:13  cid:22  cid:23  cid:15    cid:7  cid:15  cid:24  cid:26  cid:19  cid:25  cid:1  cid:24  cid:13  cid:22  cid:23  cid:15    cid:8  cid:22  cid:26  cid:23  cid:13  cid:15  cid:1  cid:10  cid:7  cid:5   cid:2  cid:26  cid:25  cid:17  cid:22  cid:23    cid:22  cid:34  cid:39  cid:38  cid:39  cid:24  cid:27  cid:5  cid:25  cid:34  cid:32  cid:1  cid:2  cid:6  cid:5  cid:15  cid:15  cid:3   cid:35  cid:39  cid:24  cid:31  cid:30  cid:37  cid:29  cid:27  cid:26  cid:1  cid:24  cid:40  cid:1  cid:19  cid:39  cid:32  cid:28  cid:34  cid:36  cid:26  cid:23  cid:33  cid:26  cid:21  cid:34  cid:33  cid:37  cid:1  cid:2  cid:6  cid:5  cid:11  cid:13  cid:3    cid:18  cid:39  cid:33  cid:27  cid:1  cid:7  cid:14  cid:4  cid:1  cid:8  cid:6  cid:6  cid:14    cid:9  cid:18  cid:25  cid:19  cid:15    cid:11  cid:25  cid:19  cid:16  cid:21  cid:22  cid:14  cid:1  cid:2  cid:1  cid:12  cid:21  cid:20  cid:23  cid:1  cid:5  cid:1  cid:10  cid:17  cid:24  cid:24  cid:18  cid:15  cid:1  cid:10  cid:17  cid:21  cid:20  cid:1  cid:11  cid:13  cid:20  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:1  cid:3  cid:7  cid:6  cid:9  cid:8  cid:4    cid:3  cid:22  cid:21  cid:25  cid:15  cid:21  cid:25    cid:4  cid:27  cid:25  cid:23  cid:18  cid:21  cid:24  cid:18  cid:13  cid:1  cid:24  cid:13  cid:22  cid:23  cid:15   cid:4  cid:27  cid:25  cid:23  cid:18  cid:21  cid:24  cid:18  cid:13  cid:1  cid:20  cid:15  cid:11  cid:24  cid:26  cid:23  cid:15  cid:24    cid:20  cid:34  cid:35  cid:39  cid:31  cid:23  cid:36  cid:30  cid:38  cid:40  cid:1  cid:2  cid:6  cid:5  cid:12  cid:8  cid:3    cid:9  cid:4  cid:10  cid:7  cid:12  cid:1  cid:16  cid:34  cid:32  cid:32  cid:27  cid:33  cid:38  cid:37   cid:10  cid:1  cid:19  cid:30  cid:34  cid:5  cid:1  cid:17  cid:30  cid:38  cid:37   cid:7  cid:13  cid:4  cid:9  cid:15  cid:15   cid:9  cid:8  cid:7  cid:1  cid:37  cid:29  cid:23  cid:36  cid:27  cid:37  cid:1   Figure 6.4: Key to ranked user-generated content units using  the example of a Youtube video. The ﬁgure shows the visualization of ranked user-generated content units for a concrete video on Youtube. The values of the measures and scores are taken from the example calcula- tion presented in Section 5.3.  The author score, source score, intrinsic score, extrinsic score, and recency are additional information that support the user to orientate himself. It enhances transparency, because all available metadata can be displayed together. The user does not have to search for additional metadata on other pages anymore  as it is usually the case for author related information and source related information . Furthermore, he does not need to rely on a feeling gained from experience to interpret the metadata. Metadata is already normalized in relation to other user-generated content units’ values and displayed with the content. Figure 6.3 shows how ranked content units could be displayed in the   6.2 A Search Engine for User-Generated Content  129  discovery engine’s interface. Figure 6.4 gives an example for a video. This application provides the user with a source of information that is independent of what is shared in his own, limited social environment.  6.2 A Search Engine for User-Generated Content  Today, for many users search engines are their main entrance to the World Wide Web  Hearst, 2009 .2  Search engines usually welcome their users with a blank page featur- ing the search ﬁeld  e.g., Google,3 Bing,4 search.com,5 WolframAl- pha6 . They do not show content before the user has entered a keyword. These search engines allow nonexploratory search for content-related search needs only. The proposed query-independent ranking approach can be used in combination with a query-dependent ranking approach for a search engine for user-generated content that supports exploratory as well as nonexploratory search.  Figure 6.5 shows a concept of the social media search engine. It allows users to express content-related information needs in addition to feature-related information needs.  The social media search engine illustrated in Figure 6.5 is an extension of the concept presented in the previous section. It is extended by the possibility to search content units by entering a search query in the search ﬁeld. The main part of the interface is the result area, which displays the user-generated content units with the highest scores.  2The results of a Web site ranking indicate that this might change in favor of social media applications. The ﬁrst and the second of the Web sites with the most traﬃc are https:  www.google.com and https:  www.facebook.com by turns  Alexa, 2013 . The calculation of traﬃc is based on a combination of average daily visitors and pageviews over the past month.  3http:  www.google.com 4http:  www.bing.com 5http:  www.search.com 6http:

ranking approach. The main area of the screen shows user-generated content units, ordered by rank. The user can type in search queries to ﬁlter the user-generated content units with regards to a speciﬁc topic for example. The weight of the ﬁve scores can be adjusted according to the user’s interests. Additionally, the user can ﬁlter content by date, by source and by country.  The scores serve as additional information for the user. They help him to orientate himself and to classify the search results.  Furthermore, additional ﬁlter concepts are added. If the information is available in the database, content units can be ﬁltered by speciﬁc dates, sources, or countries. The left hand side of Figure 6.5 indicates further possibilities to integrate ﬁlter concepts. Alternatively, the   6.2 A Search Engine for User-Generated Content  131  user could be oﬀered the possibility to ﬁlter not by source but by social media type.  There are several possibilities to combine query-independent and query-dependent rankings  Craswell et al., 2005 . The search query can be used as ﬁlter to the ranked lists of user-generated content units. The set of user-generated content units is divided into two subsets: one subset containing the content units in which the entered search query occurs and one subset containing the content units in which the entered search query does not occur.  An improved approach calculates a second query-dependent rank that reﬂects the degree of correspondence between the text and the search query. Information retrieval oﬀers a variety of approaches for query- dependent ranking of text documents. The query-dependent rank is combined with the query-independent rank.  Not all user-generated content units consist of text only. This can be a problem for text based ranking approaches. Videos and pictures from media sharing platforms for example, usually contain only a few words. The text can be found in the title or the description of the medium. Some platforms allow to tag pictures or videos with descriptive words  e.g., Flickr . Those can be used for the query- dependent ranking of user-generated content units of this type.   7 Conclusion  This ﬁnal chapter provides a summary of the most important results of this work in Section 7.1 before outlining potentials for further work and research in Section 7.2.  7.1 Summary  This thesis started out with the problem that user-generated content units provide various information in their metadata that could help to evaluate them, but is left unused due to a lack of comparability. Con- sidering the massive amount of user-generated content that is already available and that is continuously produced, users need assistance in their task to ﬁnd and evaluate user-generated content units to tap the full potential of social media.  This thesis provides a framework to compare entities by diﬀerent types and number of measures. This is achieved through the identi- ﬁcation of appropriate levels to which the measures can be aggregated and that are common for all entities.  Speciﬁcally, this thesis provides a query-independent ranking method to compare user-generated content units from diﬀerent social media platforms with each other. It solves the problem of comparability of metadata of diﬀerent quantity and types as it is the case for user- generated content. This is done by providing a model that can be applied to user-generated content with diﬀerent metadata. The ap- proach maps diﬀerent metadata to aspects that are common for all types of user-generated content.  C. Wyrwoll, Social Media, DOI 10.1007 978-3-658-06984-1_7,   Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden 2014   134  7 Conclusion  For each user-generated content unit a score for each aspect is calcu- lated. A user-generated content unit is represented by a vector of its scores. The scores are derived from measures that can be obtained from metadata.  The modeled aspects are: author-related information, source-related information, intrinsic information and extrinsic information and re- cency. For each aspect the related information is normalized with respect to the maximum known value for the information. It thus relates the information for a given user-generated content unit to other user-generated content units. For a single content unit it helps the user to estimate the magnitude of the numbers provided in its metadata.  The ﬁve scores for each document can be mapped to a single score. For a given set of user-generated content units this allows to compare them and establish an order among them. This work also provides a suggestion for an interface and a visualization of the ranked user- generated content units.  The proposed approach is language-independent. Therefore, it can be applied to user-generated content independent of the language of their content.  The proposed query-independent ranking can be combined with query-dependent ranking to built a search engine for user-generated content that accounts for the speciﬁc characteristics of user-generated content.  The application of the approach proposed in this thesis helps users to access the value of social media and to unlock more of its potential.  7.2 Extensions and Further Research  This section suggests further research and work from technical details closely related to the approach presented in this thesis to more com-   7.2 Extensions and Further Research  135  prehensive propositions, the latter also addressing challenges beyond the scope of this work.  Further research might explore solutions to derive intrinsic measures from pictures, audio ﬁles, and videos. A measure that indicates qual- ity for media ﬁles could for example be the ﬁle size, assuming that a larger ﬁle size indicates a higher resolution. But for online content the ﬁle size is often reduced and optimized for fast transfer. Therefore, the ﬁle size is not necessarily suitable as quality indicator.  Further work could extend the author score. Let the connections an author has be his primary connections and the connections of his primary connections be his secondary connections. The author score could be extended from taking only ﬁrst-degree connections into ac- count to including connections of further degrees into the author score. Given that the information is available not only about how many con- nections an author has, but also who he is connected with, the use of this information might be a reasonable extension for the author score. A solution to integrate this information is, to assign a weight to every primary connection depending on the primary connection’s number of primary connections. This way, the number of second- ary connections of an author can be included into her author score. This could be continued with a decreasing impact for further degrees of connections. A simpliﬁed example for Twitter shall illustrate this mechanism. Twitter-author A has 10 followers which have an average of 10 followers, Twitter-author B has 50 followers which have an aver- age of 10 followers and Twitter-author C has also 50 followers which have an average of 100 followers. We could compare them based on their primary connections by the number of their followers. Then, the author scores of Twitter-author B and Twitter-author C would be equal. But, let us assume we have a 50 percent probability that the people who follow Twitter-author B and C share their tweets. Then, a tweet by author B would reach his 50 followers plus half of the followers of his followers, hence 300 people. A tweet by author C would also reach his 50 followers plus half of the followers of his followers, hence 2,550 people. Consequently, it can be reasoned that,   136  7 Conclusion  even though author B has the same number of primary connections as author C, author C’s tweet will probably reach more people than a tweet from B. The implementation of this approach requires more complex data retrieval and storage than the approach presented in this work. Whether the increased complexity is worth the gain in precision is left to further research.  Further work might also investigate possibilities to extend the pro- posed approach to collaboratively created content. The proposed model assumes that a user-generated content unit has one author and one publishing date. Collaboratively created content, such as wiki-articles, can be created by many authors. Wiki-articles are also object to continuous changes that are preserved in their editing his- tory. A considerable amount of work has investigated the possibilities to analyze wiki-content and editing history. It would be interesting to explore possibilities to make results from wiki analysis comparable to other types of content as well.  The object of the ranking proposed in this work is the social me- dia document  cf., Section 3.2  that can be allocated to level 1 in Figure 3.13 on page 73 and to level 1 in Figure 7.1. For speciﬁc plat- forms, there is an additional level above these contributions. This is the case for location sharing and annotation platforms as well as rating and review platforms. For location sharing and annotation platforms the ranked objects are the annotations  cf., level 1 in Fig- ure 7.1  of locations  cf., level 0 in Figure 7.1 . For rating and review platforms the ranked objects are the reviews, which refer to a product or service. The proposed ranking approach ranks the annotations and reviews  cf., level 1 in Figure 7.1 . The object of these contributions— location, product, or service—is allocated on level 0 in Figure 7.1. In contrast to the contributions on level 1, the object of a contribution on level 0 is not a social media document as described in the social media document view in Section 3.4. In the case of location sharing and annotation platforms, the annotations refer to locations. Loca- tions do not have a distinct author and publishing date. In the case of rating and review platforms, ratings and reviews refer to a product or   7.2 Extensions and Further Research  137   cid:11  cid:17  cid:33  cid:17  cid:24  cid:1  cid:6    cid:9  cid:19  cid:19  cid:29  cid:17  cid:19  cid:13  cid:31  cid:17  cid:1  cid:29  cid:13  cid:26  cid:23  cid:21  cid:26  cid:19  cid:30  cid:1  cid:18  cid:29  cid:27  cid:25  cid:1  cid:24  cid:17  cid:33  cid:17  cid:24  cid:1  cid:7    cid:2  cid:24  cid:27  cid:15  cid:13  cid:31  cid:21  cid:27  cid:26  cid:1  cid:30  cid:20  cid:13  cid:29  cid:21  cid:26  cid:19  cid:1  cid:13  cid:26  cid:16  cid:1  cid:13  cid:26  cid:26  cid:27  cid:31  cid:13  cid:31  cid:21  cid:27  cid:26  cid:1  cid:28  cid:24  cid:13  cid:31  cid:18  cid:27  cid:29  cid:25  cid:30  cid:4  cid:1    cid:11  cid:27  cid:15  cid:13  cid:31  cid:21  cid:27  cid:26  cid:4  cid:1  cid:28  cid:29  cid:27  cid:16  cid:32  cid:15  cid:31  cid:4  cid:1  cid:27  cid:29  cid:1  cid:30  cid:17  cid:29  cid:33  cid:21  cid:15  cid:17  cid:5    cid:29  cid:13  cid:31  cid:21  cid:26  cid:19  cid:1  cid:13  cid:26  cid:16  cid:1  cid:29  cid:17  cid:33  cid:21  cid:17  cid:34  cid:1  cid:28  cid:24  cid:13  cid:31  cid:18  cid:27  cid:29  cid:25  cid:30  cid:3    cid:11  cid:17  cid:33  cid:17  cid:24  cid:1  cid:7    cid:12  cid:13  cid:26  cid:23  cid:17  cid:16  cid:1  cid:27  cid:14  cid:22  cid:17  cid:15  cid:31  cid:30    cid:11  cid:28  cid:27  cid:32  cid:30  cid:23  cid:16  cid:33  cid:32  cid:23  cid:28  cid:27    cid:10  cid:27  cid:26  cid:31  cid:29  cid:21  cid:14  cid:32  cid:31  cid:21  cid:27  cid:26    cid:10  cid:27  cid:26  cid:31  cid:29  cid:21  cid:14  cid:32  cid:31  cid:21  cid:27  cid:26    cid:11  cid:17  cid:33  cid:17  cid:24  cid:1  cid:8    cid:11  cid:28  cid:26  cid:26  cid:19  cid:27  cid:32    cid:10  cid:27  cid:25  cid:25  cid:17  cid:26  cid:31    cid:10  cid:27  cid:25  cid:25  cid:17  cid:26  cid:31    cid:5  cid:5  cid:5   Figure 7.1: Additional aggregation level for locations and  products. Location sharing and annotation platforms as well as rat- ing and review platforms have an additional level of content: level 0. Level 0 comprises locations, products, and services, which are objects of contributions. The contributions on level 1 are the objects of the ranking proposed in this work. Future work could investigate ways to aggregate the ranking of user-generated content units on level 1 to a higher refer- ence point on level 0.  service, which do not have a publishing date or author. Nevertheless, the average rating of a product is an indicator for the quality of the product, service, or experience reviewed. Consequently, for platforms of this type, level 0 is also a relevant level of consideration. Further work could investigate possibilities to aggregate the ranking of user- generated content units to a higher reference point, such as products, services, or venues. For a single source this might be straightforward, but the possibilities of integration into a cross-category compatible framework, as it is proposed in this work, needs to be investigated.  Furthermore, future research could evaluate alternative designs to re- ﬁne the concepts proposed in Chapter 6 with regard to usability. The work at hand enables to display information to the user that helps him to evaluate user-generated content. On the one hand, this addi- tional information can be a useful guidance. On the other hand, too   138  7 Conclusion  much information displayed at once could lead to counterproductive complexity of the interface. Chapter 6 provides a suggestion how to display and visualize ranked user-generated content units  cf., Fig- ure 6.3 on page 127 and Figure 6.4 on page 128 . Future research could investigate whether all measures and scores should be provided to the user at once or it is more useful to display a subset, that for example could consist of the scores only. Furthermore, it could be evaluated whether it contributes more to usability to display numer- ical values or to transfer the values into a visualization. The visualiz- ation of the values gives rise to the question on which level of detail the visualization should represent the numerical values. Further work might explore how this additional information should be visualized in a way that it is most compressible and contributes most to usability.  Beyond the scope of this thesis, there are adjacent areas that can be further developed to eﬃciently apply the proposed query-independent ranking approach to large sets of user-generated content. This con- cerns the data extraction process from the social media platforms and the data base design for example. The amount of user-generated content produced per time unit is enormous and a real-time applica- tion with the proposed features is a challenge for which strategies for eﬃcient data processing still need to be developed.   Appendix: Collection of User-Generated Content Metadata  This appendix presents a full collection of metadata available for each of the evaluated categories.

The increasing amount of user-generated content available on social media platforms requires new methods to find, evaluate, and to compare. To this day, existing ranking approaches to user-generated content do not allow for evaluation across platforms by exploiting its metadata. User-generated content, such as blog postings, forum discussions, shared videos etc. does however contain information that can be used for its evaluation independent of specific search interests. Claudia Wyrwoll presents a query- and language-independent ranking approach that allows for global evaluation of user-generated content across different platforms. Building on an insightful introduction into social media fundamentals, she proposes new models describing phenomena associated with social media, laying the foundation for further research and development.
