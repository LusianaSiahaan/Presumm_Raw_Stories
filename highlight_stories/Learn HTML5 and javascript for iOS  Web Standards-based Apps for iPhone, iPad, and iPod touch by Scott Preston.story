You are building your first web application for your iOS device  iPhone, iPad, or iPod  Touch  using HTML5 and JavaScript.   You might think that you can pick up one of your HTML or JavaScript books from years past and  then just scale it down to the size of your target device and you’ll be good to go. You’d be wrong. A lot  has changed.   In this chapter we lay the groundwork for building a mobile web app. Here we cover things like   getting familiar with your browser, setting up your mobile project, architecting the site, and creating a  site map as well as selecting the tools you’ll use to build it.   All you need is an idea, and I’ll help you take care of the rest.  You purchased this book to get started building a mobile web app. I won’t beat around the bush and   tell you about the history of the Internet or the history of browsers. Instead, let’s just jump in.   Your Browser  Mobile Safari    The browser we’ll focus on is Mobile Safari—a WebKit-based browser engine that does an excellent job  of parsing HTML5 and interpreting JavaScript.     Note  Browsers use different rendering engines. Safari and Google Chrome use WebKit, Opera uses Presto,  Firefox uses Gecko, and Internet Explorer uses Trident. In later chapters we’ll need to use specific features of  WebKit to achieve a more native-looking mobile web application.   Mobile Safari acts and renders in many ways similar to regular Safari, but it has a smaller screen, of   course, and responds to gestures and touches as opposed to clicks. It also has noticeable performance  differences and does not support Adobe Flash.   One of mobile Safari’s most important screens is its Settings screen. You can get to it by clicking on   Settings, and then Safari on the iPhone or iPad home screen. You’ll see a screen like the one shown in  Figure 1-1.   1    CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED      2   Figure 1-1. Safari Settings screen      Many of the settings here are straightforward and familiar to you from your desktop or laptop   browser. Above all, I’d recommend that you set your Advanced ➤ Debug Console to On. This will help in  debugging your app from within your simulator or on your phone. You can see this in Figure 1-2 below.       CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED      Figure 1-2. Debug settings for Safari   Planning Your Project   Before embarking on a mobile project, you need to have certain things in place, which I’ll talk about  next. If you’re a seasoned web developer you probably know all of this stuff and can skip ahead;  otherwise, keep in mind this is just an overview. If you have detailed questions, you can ask me via my  site: http:  www.learnhtml5book.com.    First, I’ll talk about setting up your environment.   Local Environment  Fortunately, OS X comes with Apache built in. To enable Apache to work with your site, go to System  Preferences ➤ Sharing, and then enable Apache by clicking on the Web Sharing box, as shown in Figure 1-3.  You now have an Apache web server serving content from  Users {username} Sites.   3    CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED      Figure 1-3. Enabling Apache in OSX      Remote Environment  Hosting   If you don’t have a web host for your site, you’ll eventually need to get one. You have plenty to choose  from. In the past I’ve had good luck with Host Gator  http:  www.hostgator.com . You can get a site there  starting at around $4 per month for Linux hosting.    Bug and Feature Tracking  Your site will not be perfect at launch, and you’ll want to add features to it over time. For this, I’d  recommend a ticketing and feature-tracking system.   If you want, you can start out with a spreadsheet or a text file, but for more elaborate projects you   can use online sites like:   http:  16bugs.com   http:  www.lighthouseapp.com               Two other options, which even integrate with your version control system, are:   Trac  http:  trac.edgewall.org     4    CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED         Redmine  http:  www.redmine.org     Redmine is my current favorite.   Version Control  Every project needs version control software and there are two main version control systems out there.  Basically, the two version control systems do the same thing—they keep track of your code:       Subversion  SVN  keeps track of all your code in a single repository or server. SVN  has been around a lot longer than Git  the other option , there’s more  documentation, and it’s a little easier to learn and understand. You can find free  online SVN providers including http:  www.beanstalkapp.com and  http:  www.springloops.com.       Git keeps track of everything locally and on a server. Git is newer and faster than   SVN but is a little more difficult to understand. There are also free online providers  like: http:  www.github.com, and http:  www.springloops.com.    If you don’t know either, then pick Git; the investment is well worth it.   Deployments  At some point, you’ll want to push your code to your host. You can do this in one of two ways:      Manually, by uploading via FTP to your host      Automatically, from your version control provider via online tools    Springloops  http:  www.springloops.com  gives you the SVN or Git version control system, and   then, based on schedule or commit, automatically deploys to your host. This will save you a lot of time  and prevent you from overwriting files accidently.   Editor  IDE or Text Editor   The editor is where you do all your work in building your site. You can choose to use either an IDE   integrated development environment  or a text editor.   An IDE  like Xcode, Eclipse, Dreamweaver, PHPStorm, and RubyMine  has the  added benefits of code content assist, version control Integration, and color  coding, all of which make your programming easier and you more productive.   A text editor like TextMate, Vim, or Emacs can have the same features and there  are extensions that allow some to come close to an IDE, but often the learning  curve is a little steeper.   Site Integration  How do you want to integrate with your site? You can do this in one of two ways:    Fully integrate: Everything all together in the same web project including the  database code, your MVC framework, and your mobile site. The benefits of a fully  integrated approach is you have less JavaScript and can build your pages on the fly.               5    CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED                 Service layer integration: You have your mobile site with HTML, CSS, and  JavaScript, and all calls for data and interaction to your MVC framework are done  via Ajax  asynchronous JavaScript and XML .    The benefits of the service layer integration is that you can add different mobile sites optimized for   different browsers without changing your back end. You can also change your back end, for example  from CakePHP to Ruby on Rails, and you won’t need to change your mobile site at all. The last benefit is  that turning your mobile site into a native app will be very easy.    I will use both these approaches for the sample mobile web app and native app. You will see the   benefits of both methods as you progress through the building of your app.    Site Maps  There are two kinds of site maps:    The first is what a web crawler like Google uses to better index a web site.    The second is a high-level block diagram or outline of your site that shows all the  pages and how they link together. That’s the site map you need to create before  you start your project.   You can create a sitemap either in a block diagram or with plain text. Sometimes block diagrams are   better for explaining site structure to customers. A text version might look something like this:   Page 1 Detail 1  get more data from web API       Home      Page 1  get data from web API          Page 1 Detail 2      Detail 2 Info      Page 2     Contact         About       Link to Twitter   Link to Facebook   Wireframes  A wireframe is a rough sketch of a page or screen without any colors or details. For this I recommend  that you just take a blank iPhone or iPad template and start drawing what you want your app to look like.   Figure 1-4 shows a sample wireframe of a simple mobile web app with tabbed navigation at the   bottom.   6       CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED   Figure 1-4. Sample wireframe      I created the above wireframe using a free Firefox plugin called Pencil.  You can find more about The Pencil Project here: http:  pencil.evolus.vn.    Project Tracking and Management  Finally, to put everything together, especially if you’re getting paid by someone to build this mobile web  app, you need a project-tracking and management system. While this isn’t a requirement for any of the  programming in this book, it could aid you in communicating about the development of your  application.   This can be as simple as using a spreadsheet or using a project management software product like   Base Camp  http:  basecamphq.com  .    The other tools I mentioned  Redmine, Trac, Springloops, and Lighthouse  also do a good job of   tracking milestones, and some even come close to becoming full project management systems.   Application Components   Now you’re almost ready to start building your mobile web app. But before we write any code, we need  to put all the major parts of your application on the table to see how they fit together.   This will also form the large buckets for your project plan. This will help you estimate how long your   project will take and at the same time give you a product launch checklist.   Your app will have several parts, each of which is detailed below and in Figure 1-5:   Site core – The HTML pages of your web site         CSS – The style sheets for your site that will determine it’s look and feel      JavaScript – The part of your site that allows it to interact with the APIs and to  dynamically pull content from your site’s database and API   7    CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED                   External libraries – The parts of your site like a mobile framework, jQuery, or  plugins   Template components –The parts of your site that are repeated over and over, like  the header and footer and the navigation   External data –The data your application will use—either on your server or stored  locally on your iOS device   Phone data –The data from your phone like your GPS or accelerometer data   Knowing these large buckets of your app beforehand will help you define and plan your project.   Figure 1-5. The parts of your mobile web app   Now we are ready to start coding.   Organizing Your Files   If you are working with a web project sometimes your files will be organized automatically for you via  the web framework you’ve chosen. I’ve seen two methods for creating mobile sites:      One is to give the mobile site its own subdomain like http:  m.domain.com. This is   the approach I took with the sample application in this book.       The other is to have it run off a subdirectory like http:  www.domain.com mobile.    Subdomain  m.domain.com   Using this structure allows you to create your own stand-alone mobile web application. The files do not  need to mingle with the other files of your app.    8       CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED   Separating your code is important because your mobile web app might be using a different version   of a JavaScript framework like jQuery, and having two versions of the same library on your site isn’t a  habit you want to start.   Subdirectory  m or  mobile  Sometimes you might want to reuse parts of your standard web site within your mobile site, or your  mobile site is so simple that you don’t need to create an entire web application and subdomain. If you  have only a few pages in your mobile site or are experimenting with a few things, then just put your files  in a subdirectory off the main web root.   Using a subdirectory is also more convenient if you want to create a mobile site for iPhone and iPad   but share resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks from the main site.   Files to Organize  For a static web project there are really only four kinds of files to organize: cascading style sheets  CSS ,  JavaScript  JS , images  GIF, PNG, and JPG , and HTML.   To keep things organized I’d create a directory structure like this:                            - for all HTML files    css - for all CSS    js - for all JavaScript    m css - for all CSS    m js - for all JavaScript    m images - for all images.    images - for all images Or, if your application structure is in a subdirectory: m -  for all HTML files   How to link your files  You can use two mechanisms for linking files, relative and absolute linking.      Relative linking uses a reference relative to the current file. For example if you   have an image in  images or  m images and your html is in either   or  m, you can  create the following   tag to reference this file:           Absolute linking creates two different links:       or       From the above example you can see that relative linking is more flexible if you’ll be refactoring the  entire directory structure like all of the .html, .css and .js together, then you wouldn’t need to make any  changes since everything is relative. But absolute linking is easier to work with if your HTML files exist in  multiple subdirectories.    For example, let’s say you have four files:   9    CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED                    index.html   subdir index.html   subdir subdir2 index.html   images someimage.jpg              like this:   to use:        for all three images.   If you wanted image tags for the header and everything was relative, your   tags would look   This is a mess if you want to use a common file for the header or navigation. It would be much easier   What about multiple devices?  This directory structure might work for a single mobile web site, but eventually you may want to manage  multiple devices like an iPhone and an iPad, and you will need a directory structure to facilitate that.   It’s also a little complicated because you need to balance two things code duplication and minimal   regression testing.   Let’s say that you don’t believe in having duplicate copies of code on your site. For example, you’re  using jQuery 1.4 and don’t want to upgrade to a newer version because it’s also used on your main web  site and there’s already a lot of code using it.   So you chug along and build your mobile web site only to find that the mobile framework you’ve   chosen works best only with jQuery 1.6. What do you do?      Option A: You live with two versions of jQuery on your site.     Option B: You replace 1.4 with 1.6 and then retest everything to ensure that      Option C: You replace 1.4 with 1.6 and don’t retest because it shouldn’t break   nothing broke.   anything.             Option A is the path we’ll take for separate devices: an iPhone and an iPad. Option A has a directory   structure that looks like this:     ,  js,  css,  images – for all common assets    iphone,  iphone css,  iphone js,  iphone images – for iPhone-only assets    ipad,  ipad css,  ipad js,  ipad images – for iPad-only assets   This option allows for isolation and prevents large regression tests when working to enhance your  site for a single device. The only thing it adds to the project is a few more files and, if they are needed, a  few additional copies of libraries.   Now that we have a directory structure in mind, let’s see how to make a change to your main web   site’s home page or root directory to point the mobile device to your new mobile web site.   10    CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED      Browser Redirection   When iPhone or iPad users come to your site, you don’t want them to have to search for the mobile site  button and you don’t want to rely on them to know your mobile URL. To address this, you need to  automatically send them there.   You can do this via Apache or JavaScript.   Companion Site Reference   Example 1-1: Follow the link below to run these examples on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter1 redirect.php   Apache Redirection  Apache redirection first looks at the USER_AGENT sent in the HEADER of the request and then looks for a  cookie if the user requests to be taken to the full site and not the mobile site. I’ve added the cookie  because sometimes your mobile web site user might want to visit the normal, non-optimized site.   This method is preferred over JavaScript because it’s done outside of code and you don’t need to   worry about overwriting or breaking it by mistake.   The example below redirects your user to the new domain m.domain.com, unless the nomobile cookie   is set.   RewriteEngine On  RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} "iphoneipodipadgooglebot-mobile" [NC]  RewriteCond %{HTTP_COOKIE} !^.*nomobile=true.*$  RewriteRule ^.*$ https:  m.domain.com [R=301]   The next example redirects your user to the  m directory of your site, unless the nomobile cookie is set.   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^ m .*$  RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} "iphoneipodipadgooglebot-mobile" [NC]  RewriteCond %{HTTP_COOKIE} !^.*nomobile=true.*$  RewriteRule ^ .* $  m  [L,R=301]   JavaScript Redirection  If you don’t have access to the Apache config, or mod_rewrite is not enabled on your server, you can use  client-side redirection, as shown here. Just make sure to place this code in the   of your web page.          var isiPhone = navigator.userAgent.match  iPhone i ;      var isiPod = navigator.userAgent.match  iPod i ;      var isiPad = navigator.userAgent.match  iPad i ;         check for mobile iOS device      if isiPhone  isiPod  isiPad  {          if  !bypassRedirect    {              alert "redirecting user here" ;                 window.location = ' m';   11    CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED              } else {              alert "user bypass message is true" ;          }      } else {          alert "not a mobile device" ;      }        function bypassRedirect   {          return false;             this logic will be added later in Chapter 12.      }      Next, let’s look at some vital tags that we’ll use in our mobile app later in the chapter—and some   that we won’t use in this chapter, but that you may find useful in the future.       Mobile Safari uses a few specific   tags to optimize the mobile browser—things like viewport,  scrolling, and whether or not to hide the address or status bar.   Here’s a short description and the syntax.   apple-mobile-web-app-capable  Sets whether the web application runs in full-screen mode.        Syntax:          Description: When set to yes, the web application runs in full-screen mode   outside of Safari. You also need to have saved this web app on the home screen of  your iOS device.   apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style  Sets the style of the status bar if the web application is run in full screen mode.          Description: Optional values are default, black, and black-translucent.   format-detection  Automatically detects the format of telephone numbers in a web page.       Syntax:       Syntax          Description: This is enabled by default; to disable this, set it to no.      12       CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED   viewport  The viewport is the area in a browser that contains the content of a web page; this area can be larger or  smaller than the visible area. As it contains the contents of the web page, the size of the viewport affects  how the contents are displayed and how text wraps. I’ll show you how to work with the viewport in the  next section.   The viewport meta tag sets the width and scale of the viewport. Normally, the iPhone will try to  format the entire web site on the screen, and you have to zoom and scroll to read it on your mobile  device. Using a combination of the values below, you can change how the site is rendered.                              Syntax       width: The width in pixels. The default is 980.   height: The height in pixels. The default is calculated based on the width.   initial scale: The default is calculated to fit the entire web page in the visible  area.   minimum-scale: The default is .25.   maximum-scale: The default is 1.6.   user-scalable: Determines whether a user can zoom in and out.   device-width & device-height: The width and height of the device in pixels.   Screen Size and Viewport   One thing you’ll note about the different screen sizes and viewports of the iPhone, iPhone4, and iPad is  the DPI. While your iPhone4 with retina display has a higher resolution and DPI, your web site is still  best viewed at 320 cid:1 480. The iPad is optimized for the same working area as an older laptop or PC. I’ll  talk more about scaling for the retina display in Chapter 3.   While you might think you have the entire pixel size to work with, you really don’t because the  address, status, and button bars take up substantial room. In portrait orientation on an iPhone, the  address and status bars take up 80 pixels at the top, and the button bar takes up 44 pixels at the bottom,  so the working area is smaller than the actual screen, as summarized in Table 1-1.   Table 1-1. Example Screen Size Matrix   Device   iPhone    Resolution   320 cid:1 480  portrait    iPhone4   640 cid:1 960  portrait    iPad   1024 cid:1 768  landscape    DPI   163dpi   326dpi   132dpi   Working Area   320 cid:1 356   640 cid:1 712   1024 cid:1 674   The various bars take up slightly less room in landscape orientation, so here’s an example of an   iPhone turned on its side. The actual pixels you have to work with are 480 cid:1 208. That’s 80 pixels for the  address and status bars and 32 pixels for the button bar, as shown in Figure 1-6.   13    Figure 1-6. Landscape screen real estate      Let’s see how this affects a mobile web page: When viewing a web site on the iPhone in full screen   mode  no   viewport is set , you get a screen like the one shown in Figure 1-7.   Companion Site Reference   Example 1-2: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.   http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter1 fullscreen.php   CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED      14       CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED   Figure 1-7. Full screen example  no viewport tag used       The iPhone has a default viewport of 980 pixels. So if the site you are viewing is larger than that, it   will zoom out to fit, as is the case in Figure 1-7. If the site you are viewing is optimized for a smaller  width, then you might need to zoom in to read the site.    This means that a 320-pixel iPhone showing 980 pixels of space has a zoom level of .3.  All of this kind of calculation can give you a headache. Fortunately, there’s a way around this, and   that’s to specify the viewport the device should use.   Because we want to build a site optimized for mobile browsers, we’ll add the following meta tag and   change how the page is viewed and zoomed, with the results shown in Figure 1-8.       15    CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED      Companion Site Reference   Example 1-3: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.   http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter1 viewport.php   Figure 1-8. Same page with viewport   tag      This takes care of auto-sizing your web site. All you need to do now is make sure your images and   styles support this height and width.   16    CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED      The Sample App   This book follows the process of creating a mobile web site and iPhone app for www.grandviewave.com   Grandview Avenue dot com . At the end of each chapter I’ll have a Putting It All Together section where  I’ll discuss my sample app and how to use the knowledge in that chapter to enhance and modify a real- world application.   Grandview is a small community a few miles from downtown Columbus and The Ohio State   University. It has a main drag called Grandview Avenue on which there are 50-plus businesses ranging  from dance studios and movie theaters to coffee shops and bars.   Living just a few blocks away I always wanted to have a way to contact a local restaurant for   reservations, or I’d want to know what band was playing at Grandview Café that evening. But none of the  social apps seemed to have the data all in one place or with sufficient detail to get this information. So I  created www.grandviewave.com and a simple iPhone app called Grandview Ave.   Figure 1-9. The web version of grandviewave.com      17    CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED   I also need to mention that I had a lot of help on the project from a local business on Grandview   Avenue called Iannarino Dexter Creative. Joe helped me spread the word about the site and app, Mike  helped with the logo design, and Kate helped design the site.   Until this year the site was rather basic and just listed names of businesses and had a few features   like Near Me using GPS. But upon deciding to write this book, I thought why not enhance Grandview Ave  and at the same time provide an app and framework for others to use to build their own community  sites. You can see the web version in Figure 1-9.   You can see from the web site it’s rather simple. It has a business directory, events, news, and   specials as well as information about the site and parking. Throughout this book we are going to  enhance this site and reinvent the mobile experience. In fact, we’re going to start from scratch  completely. Table 1-2 shows the various tools I used when creating the mobile web app.   Table 1-2.

It will have a filler image, followed by normal-looking HTML with a  default font.   The only thing applied will be the   viewport discussed earlier in this chapter. It will have no  HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, or anything resembling an iPhone app. Hopefully, this is exactly what you are  starting with since you’re learning how to build an app from scratch.   18       CHAPTER 1    GETTING STARTED   Figure 1-10.

Directory structure of m.grandviewave.com   Since we are going to build the app as we go, this content will gradually change and might grow   rather large, so you won’t see some of the code from the previous sections described too much.

I recommend you open up your   favorite editor and create a simple page that you want to be the base for your new mobile web app.   Summary   this book.   The main thing I want you to take away from this chapter is knowing where to start and creating a very  simple viewported web site using nothing more than an extra   tag and simple HTML.   To save you some time later on, I showed you a few ways to set up your project and organize your files.   Finally, I talked a little bit about a sample application we are going to build through the chapters in   Before moving on to the next chapter, you should know how to do the following:      Configure Mobile Safari for development.     Create a plan for your mobile web app, including a local environment & version control.     Know if you’re going to use a subdomain or subdirectory.     Know how to redirect a user from the main site to your mobile site.     Know how to use the   tags to create a viewport for your iOS device.  I also introduced you to the sample app I’m going to create throughout this book.  Next I’ll give a short overview of HTML5—mainly the parts you’ll want to use to start building your   own web app.   20    C H A P T E R  2               HTML5 in Short   This chapter is not a complete reference on HTML5, but it teaches you enough about HTML5 to be  dangerous.    This chapter also does not go into detail on some of the most popular elements of HTML5 such as    ,  , and  . Those elements require an entire chapter of discussion, which will come  later in this book.   Instead, this chapter provides an overview of some HTML5-based APIs including web workers, web   sockets, and geolocation.    So what do I talk about in this chapter? Mainly three things:      What HTML5 is and isn’t         The new HTML5 structural elements and attributes   The new HTML5 form input types and attributes   Then I show you how I applied those new features to my sample app, Grandview Avenue, to show   you how you would use some of these HTML5 features in a real-world application. Figure 2-1 shows the  official logo of HTML5.   Figure 2-1. Official HTML5 Logo      21    CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT      What Is HTML5?   First and foremost HTML5 is still in DRAFT state. That means that nothing I tell you today is 100%  guaranteed to be in the official specification when it’s released. That being said, all of the current  browsers, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera, are all racing as fast as they can to get as  much of the HTML5 “DRAFT” in their desktop and mobile browsers.   If you ask someone about HTML5 you’ll either hear something about the official specification by  the W3C or you’ll hear about some of the features that are new and cool but not yet finalized, such as  web workers.   I talk about all of the new cool stuff and am not completely strict on what’s in the HTML5   specification. But ironically I think the best way to tell you about HTML5 is to start by telling you what  it’s not.   It’s Not XHTML   This means that it does not need to follow XML validation as the following statements are equivalent.   1:  This is a div     and    2:  This is another div     So although clearly statement 1 would not pass an XML XHTML validation, HTML5 ensures that   both of these statements are rendered in exactly the same way.   It’s Not HTML4 +1  You have to admit the previous versions of HTML and XHTML were a little lofty in their goals. The idea  was a standards body would create a specification for how to mark up a page and all the browser  vendors would follow this standard 100% and we’d all be living in the land of unicorns and rainbows  right? Wrong!   What happened was that you’d end up with one browser that would implement some subset of the  specification, and create its own stuff. Then you’d get another browser to implement a different subset  of the specification and add its own stuff, which basically vetoed the W3C’s specification.   HTML5 needed to start and work differently. So what happened? Basically they started the other  way around. They went to each of the major browser vendors, Microsoft, Mozilla, Google, Apple, and  Opera and asked, “What do you want in the specification? What can you all agree on?” They ended   up with:               A set of new form input types and form attributes   A set of attributes   A set of new APIs   A set of tags   So now you could still have the browser vendors going out doing their own thing, but if they didn’t   agree on the tags attributes APIs it would not go into the specification. That meant that the  specification was now supported by everyone.   22   4      CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT   HTML5 Is Not Just Markup  HTML5 is not just tags but it’s also a set of JavaScript APIs to provide a richer user experience. The APIs  also tried to enhance the core foundations of the browser APIs. So rather than having to use a JavaScript  framework for selector features, the document now has selectors. Now rather than having to access  native custom written APIs for geolocation, the document has functions such as getCurrentPosition.  Here’s a short summary of the new API features you will have with your new HTML5 document.   Selectors  This is document.getElementById on steroids, or all the goodness of jQuery at your fingertips in native  JavaScript. By expanding the criteria in which you can select a document element, you make it much  easier to access the elements in your page either individually or grouped.      var elts1 = document.getElementsByClassName "someclass" ;  var elts2 = document.querySelectorAll "ul li:first-child" ;  var elt1 = document.querySelector "someid" ;      Canvas and Drawing  This gives you the ability to draw in the page. I talk more about this element in Chapter 9. This example  draws a red square.   Companion Site Reference   Example 2-1: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter2 canvas.php          var canvas = document.querySelector 'simplecanvas' ;  var ctx = canvas.getContext '2d' ;  ctx.fillStyle='rgb 255,0,0 ';  ctx.fillRect 0,0,100,100 ;      Media Playback  This gives you greater control over the audio and video playback. I talk more about this in Chapter 10.  This example loads a test video and plays it within the video tag.   23    CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT      Companion Site Reference   Example 2-2: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter2 video.php               var v = document.querySelector 'myvid' ;  v.play  ;      Offline Storage  This does not have a JavaScript component, but it allows images or other assets to be stored offline, for  example, by adding this to the   tag:       your browser receives a manifest file which looks like:   CACHE MANIFEST   css grandview.css   js grandview js   images grandview.png   allowing these files to be retrieved locally in the event that you’re offline. I talk more about this feature in  Chapter 12.   Local and Session Storage  Local and session storage allows you to store items in your web browser as Name–Value pairs versus an  SQL database as in Web SQL Storage. You can think of this as a really powerful client-side cookie.  Local storage stores data forever until you delete it. Session stores it for one session. Both have   methods for setItem and removeItem allowing you to store and retrieve. I talk more about this in  Chapter 12.   Document Editing  Editing elements is now very easy and you do this by just specifying the attribute:    contenteditable="true"   This allows a particular part of the page to be editable but by itself it’s rather limited, so to make use   of it you need to access the element’s edited content.    24       CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT   Companion Site Reference   Example 2-3: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter2 edits.php   So if you’re editing the following markup, all you need to do is click on the content section, then the   “Save” button.    This is some silly text.    Save      function save   {  var content = document.querySelector "test" .innerHTML;  alert content ;    or do something else  }      Document Messaging  Prior to HTML5, web browsers prevented sites from accessing each other if they had different origins or  were on different domains  aka “Cross-Site Scripting” . This was a preventive security measure.  This means that one part of the document that lived on www.domain1.com could not talk to a   document that lived on www.domain2.com. The cross-document messaging API in HTML5 allows this  while also providing security. I talk more about document messaging in Chapter 14.   Web Sockets  Web sockets are amazing. They eliminate the need for polling so that if, for example, you have some data  that are changed on the server, instead of polling the server every few seconds or minutes to look for an  update, your server can send a message to the client with the update  note: link only for example  purposes :   var ws = new WebSocket "ws:  m.grandviewave.com test" ;  ws.send "anything new?" ;   Web sockets will allow your mobile web application and your server to communicate in real time. I   talk more about this in Chapter 14.   Drag and Drop  HTML5 provides the ability to drag and drop elements by adding two attributes, draggable and dropzone.  Unfortunately it’s not supported by Mobile Safari. My guess is that it was difficult to get this to work with  a multitouch interface and it works best with a mouse and buttons.   25    CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT      History Management  Prior to HTML5 the best way to know your history in a rich  Ajax-based  web page was to poll the  location.hash property on a timer.    HTML5 now provides an API that allows you to access the location.hash and in fact gives you a more   robust mechanism for accessing the entire history of a session.   The event fires when the hash has changed as onHashChange. The methods added to the history   object are pushDate   and replaceState   allowing you to put items into and retrieve items from the  history object. I talk more about this in Chapter 14.   Microdata  Microdata are used to give semantic meaning to a web page. For example, how’s the web or a system  supposed to know that the text on a page is an “Event” that takes place at a specific time and place? Well  it can’t, unless you parse through and look for data and times and geolocation data. But then what might  work for one website won’t work for another because the HTML would be in a different format.   Microdata add the following attributes to provide this kind of semantic meaning to the content on a  page: itemscope, itemtype, itemid, itemprop, and itemref. Unfortunately Microdata are not supported in  Safari Mobile at this time.   Geolocation  Geolocation is the ability of your mobile browser to identify its position using a GPS  global positioning  system . The mechanism is basically defined by the following example.   navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition successFunction, errorFunction ;    function successFunction pos  {             do something here with pos  }    function errorFunction err  {             do something with the error  }   I talk extensively about geolocation and interaction with Google Maps in Chapter 7.   File API  HTML5 now provides a mechanism for working with local files. Specifically the specification talks about  the following kinds of local files.                    FileList: This is an array of files in the local system.   Blob: This represents raw binary data.   File: This is read-only and is a collection of information attributes such as name  and date of last modification.   FileReader: Provides methods to read a File or Blob.   FileError: Provides for error conditions that occur when using the File API.   Unfortunately Mobile Safari does not support the File API at this time.   26       CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT   Web Workers  Web workers are used for JavaScript-based threading and running JavaScript in the background. The  worker interface has two methods, terminate   and postMessage  . Let’s say I wanted to load some data  in the background; I might create a worker like this:      var dataWorker = new Worker 'data.js' ;  dataworker.onmessage = function event  {             enable navigation  };      I talk more about web workers in Chapter 14.   HTML5 Support   If you plan on using HTML5 for all mobile browsers, know that all browsers don’t support HTML5 in the  same way as Mobile Safari. Mobile Safari on the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad don’t completely support  everything that’s in HTML5 either. Table 2-1 gives a summary. Although they grade out at over 90% you  might want to keep some of these things in mind when designing your mobile web app.   Table 2-1. HTML5 Features with Limited or No Support in Mobile Safari  Limited   No Support   Audio and Video Codecs  No support for Ogg, WebM   Description   Missing support for certain elements at this time   Missing support for certain input types and related tags   Touch interface not conducive to Drag drop interactions built for mouse   Text Markup   Form Attributes   Drag and Drop   Microdata   3D Canvas   Files API   Webcam   No support at this time   Battery and resource constraints   No support at this time   No support at this time   Web Notifications   No support at this time   For a complete list of how much HTML5 support you have in your browser, go to HTML5 Test    http:  html5test.com , where it will tell you how much of HTML5 tags and APIs are supported.  You can also stay tuned for later versions of iOS as support for many of these features will be   available.   27    CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT   HTML5 Overview   This is a quick-reference guide to how to use HTML5 for your mobile website.   DOCTYPE and UTF-8  To use HTML5 all you need are the following three lines.             Because you can also use   or even  , your   programming style is important for readability and maintainability. So pick a style and stick with it.   New Attributes  These are some new global attributes added to HTML5; you can add these attributes to any element.                       Contenteditable ="truefalse": Allows you to a make an element editable.   contextmenu="menu_id": Associates the element with a menu element.   draggable="truefalseauto": Specifies whether you can drag an element.   dropzone="copymovelink": Specifies what happens when an item is dragged on  this element.   Hidden: Hides an element.   spellcheck="truefalse": Specifies whether an element needs its spelling or  grammar checked.   New Structural Tags  All of these new tags are designed to give more semantic meaning and replace all of the custom CSS  classNames and IDs given to   tags.      This is like a   or   element but can be used for content like a blog entry or in a forum post  to give more semantic meaning.               This is an article.            Article Content...       28       CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT      This is content that is aside from the content in which it’s placed. It should be related to the surrounding  content.               This is content aside from the main part.          This is used to describe the parts or details of a document  not currently supported by Mobile Safari .               All rights reserved.         and    This is an image within a document and its caption.               This is a nice picture!                     This is the footer of a document.              Footer of page.         And this is the header of a document.              Header of page        This is a section of headings grouped together:  ,  , and so on.               Heading1            Heading2          This is text that should be highlighted.    The quick brown  fox  jumped over the lazy dog.    29    CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT         This is the navigation section of a document.              Site navigation         This is an indicator of work in progress  not supported by Mobile Safari .             These are Chinese notes or characters  limited support .      This is what to show browsers instead of the   element.      This is used for explanation of the ruby element.      This is a section of a document such as   or   but more generic.               This is a section.            Section Content...          This is used for defining a time or date  not supported .    Hours of operation are from:  10AM  to  10PM .      This is used for defining a good place for a word break.    The name of the book web site is http:  www. learnhtml5book .com.    Figure 2-2 shows a simple page built from some of these new structural elements. I’ve used the   following bit of CSS to highlight the different elements.      header,nav,footer,article,section {margin:5px;}  header,nav,footer {border:1px solid 000;}  section {border:1px dotted green;}      30          CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT   Companion Site Reference   Example 2-4: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter2 structure.php     Figure 2-2. New Elements with Simple CSS   New Media Tags  Audio and video, along with   and  , get their own chapter later in the book  Chapter  10 , so I don’t say much about them here. I just quickly summarize the files and attributes they support.   31    CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT        and    The   tags support .wav, .mp3, and .acc files, and the attributes autoplay, controls, loop, preload,  and src. iOS supports only MPEG4 and H.264 video codecs, but it supports all these attributes: audio,  autoplay, controls, height, width, loop, poster, preload, and src.      Used in conjunction with either the   or   tags, this child element helps to define the source  of the media. It has the attributes media, src, and type.       This tag defines embedded content such as a .swf file. It has the attributes height, src, type, and width.    New Form Tags  Here’s a list of some of the new form tags available to you in HTML5.      The datalist element defines a list of options. You can think of this as a predefined auto-complete  not  supported .                      This defines a logically grouped set of field elements  limited support .          Form:       Name:        Email:              This generates a public–private key pair.   Encryption:        This defines a measurement within a known range  not supported .    5 of 10    32    CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT         This represents the result of a calculation.   New Form Input Types  There is a whole range of new input types provided by HTML5.   type='tel'  This allows for the input of a phone number. On the iPhone it will also display a phone dial pad for  input.   Tel:     type='search'  This is used for search fields such as Google or site search.   Search:     type='url'  This is used for fields that should contain a URL address.   URL:     type='email'  This is used for fields that should contain an email address.   Email:     type='datetime'  This is used for fields that should contain a date and time.   DateTime:     type='date'  This is used for fields that should contain a date. What’s really nice is that in some of these fields Mobile  Safari will provide you automatic date select widgets, as you can see in Figure 2-3.   Date:     33    CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT      Figure 2-3. Example of Date Input Type      type='month'  This is used for fields that should contain a month.   Month:     type='week'  This is used for fields that should contain a week  no customized user-interface .   Week:     type='time'  This is used for fields that should contain a time.   Time:     34    CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT      type='datetime-local'  This is used for fields that should contain a time in the local time zone of the user.   DateTime:     type='range'  This is a slider used for fields that are within a numerical range.   Range:     type='color'  This is used for fields that should contain a color.   Color:     When you put all these form elements together you get the following sample page. Most of these   fields look like  , however, from Figure 2-3 you can see that there’s sometimes a  custom user-interface designed to allow for easier input.   Sample Form Code  Here’s an example of a form using the new input types. This form will prompt you for valid inputs  such  as a valid URL , but doesn’t do anything with the data.   Companion Site Reference   Example 2-5: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter2 form.php      Number: <input type="number" name="number" placeholder="Enter a number" cid:1    autofocus="autofocus" required>   Email:     URL:     Date:     Week:     Month:     DateTime:     Time:     Range:     Search:     Tel:            35    CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT      Figure 2-4. All form elements      Additional Form Element Attributes  HTML5 provides some useful additional attributes for the input types in your forms  see Figure 2-4 . For  example, this is the markup for an email input type with autofocus and placeholder text:   Email: <input type="email" required="required" placeholder="Enter your email" cid:1    autofocus required>   These new attributes assist in form behavior and form validation.   autocomplete: Specifies that the field should have an autocomplete function   autofocus: Specifies that the field should be focused on    loadform: Specifies one or more forms to which the field belongs   formaction: An override for the action property of the elements form                36       CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT   formenctype: An override for the type property of the elements form   formmethod: An override for the method of the elements form   formnovalidate: An override of the elements form telling it not to validate   formtarget: An override from the elements form specifying a different target    height and width: Used in conjunction with the image input type, specifying its  height and width   list: Used in conjunction with the datalist field, specifying the ID of the datalist    min, max, and step: These are used to specify restrictions to the input types  containing numbers or dates    multiple: Like the select tag, other input types such as input type=file can now  contain multiple values so that multiple files can be uploaded   novalidate: Tells the form not to validate on submission    pattern: A regular expression pattern to be used when validating a particular  input type   placeholder: Placeholder text instead of a blank field   required: Tells the form that the current element is required and must be  validated prior to submission   Removed Tags  I wrap up this quick reference to HTML5 with a list of some of the tags that have been removed from the  HTML specification. To be honest, some of them are tags I’ve never even used!                                                                                                                                                37    CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT   Choosing HTML5 Features to Use in Your Apps  The main thing to remember about HTML5 is that it’s still a draft. Although most of the elements and  APIs surrounding the HTML5 specification are still under review, a vast majority of everything you see  today will be there when it becomes official.    Because browser vendors have the ultimate veto power of what gets in the spec, I would look to   future browser releases and their support of certain HTML5 features as a means of determining whether  you should implement that particular part of the spec.   Putting It All Together   This chapter just focused on structural and form elements, and so that’s what I created in the sample  app to show you how you might use some of these elements in a real-world project.   I left the sample app with a standard viewport HTML page, but there was no DOCTYPE, or HTML5-  based structural elements. The header was:          Sample Header?                       Sample Header?                But now with our new HTML5 tags, that page looks a little different.   This now tells our browser to start rendering the page with HTML5 specific tags. This header   appears in the source code for every example in the book, so I just assume you’ve got it and I won’t  repeat it each time I start a new example.   Adding the New Structural Elements to the Homepage  The only part of the HTML5 spec I currently use in the sample app is the new structural elements;  specifically, I use these new elements in my mobile app:    : For the header of the app.    : For the site navigation. I think I’ll use two kinds of navigation, in-page list  navigation and tabbed navigation  discussed in Chapter 6 .    : For the site footer.    : For the sections of the page.     and  : I use these for the photos on the site of the businesses  or of the events.                    38       CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT   Here is the markup for my sample home page so far, including these new elements.             Sample Header?                      Sample Header?                     Navigation?       Businesses    Near Me    Sales &amp; Specials    Parking    The Avenue Hunt    Audio &amp; Video    About    Contact            Nothing Yet            So although not that impressive, it gives us the hooks we need for styling in the next chapter and   functionality throughout the rest of the book.   and I also want to perform some basic validation.   Next I want to have a way to capture email addresses on the new app. So for that I use the email type   A Sample Contact Form with Validation  The form uses just the email type, but I also use required and placeholder attributes. I could do more  with the form upon validation, but for now I just want to print an alert on the page.      Email:                  var f  = document.querySelector "form" ;          f.onsubmit = function   {   39    CHAPTER 2    HTML5 IN SHORT           if  f.checkValidity    {              alert "form ok" ;          } else {              alert "form not ok" ;          }      };      Chapter Summary   This chapter talked about three major areas of HTML5:               API Overview: These are the new JavaScript APIs available to you including  Geolocation, web workers, web sockets, and so on.   Structural Elements: Items intended to replace CSS IDs and ClassNames, such as   ,  ,  , and so on.   Form Input Type Attributes: These are extensions of the   tag to include a  broader form datatype including date, email, range, and so on.   There are other parts of HTML5 that I only mentioned briefly because I go over those in greater   detail in later chapters. They include:     Geolocation  Chapter 7      Canvas  Chapter 9         Offline apps and local storage  Chapter 12      Web workers and web sockets  Chapter 14    Audio and video  Chapter 10    I also updated the sample app to include the basic HTML5 structural elements, started to sketch out   the home page, and added a form with basic form processing.   Before moving on to the next chapter you should know how to do the following.      Know how make your document an HTML5 document with the DOCTYPE.     Be able to create and use HTML5 structural elements and attributes.     Be able to create and use HTML5 form input types and attributes.     Know enough about the API components to start thinking of how you want to use   these features in your mobile web app.   Next, I discuss how to make your app look like a native iPhone app.         40    C H A P T E R  3               CSS3 and iOS Styling   If you want your mobile site to look like a native app you’ll need to spend some time learning the new  features of CSS3. In particular there are new features that allow your lists to take on a native look and feel  and new features to create awesome buttons as well as novel ways to use backgrounds or create  stunning effects.   One way to create these effects is with query selectors and learning how to optimize your CSS for   Retina Displays or optimizing for orientation. You might even want to be able to save your web  application to the home screen of your iPad or iPhone.   Because CSS3 is a lot different than CSS1 or CSS2 I spend a little bit of time telling you about the   differences. This will allow you to navigate the documentation and specification on the web to find  exactly what you need if you don’t find it here.    What is CSS3?   maintained.   First and foremost CSS stands for cascading stylesheets.    CSS Level 1  or CSS1  was first published in December of 1996. This version of the CSS is no longer   CSS Level 2  or CSS2  was first published in 1998 and is a superset of CSS1; it added features   including positioning and z-index. Again this version of the CSS is no longer maintained.   CSS Level 2 revision 1  or CSS2.1  was first published in 2005. It was only published as a   recommendation on June 7th, 2011.    CSS Level 3  or CSS3  is a little different. It uses CSS2.1 as its core and builds upon this core module   by module rather than an entire set of specifications.   For a complete list of CSS modules you can visit the W3C here:   http:  www.w3.org Style CSS current-work   We are talking about only the following modules for this book.      Media Queries     Backgrounds and Borders                 Overflow   Font  2D 3D Transformations  Transitions and Animations  Text Effects   41    CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING      CSS Basics   Before we talk about anything new there are a few fundamentals we need to take care of, such as how to  place CSS on your site and how to select specific styles for specific devices  iPhone or iPad .   Using Your CSS  Question: Do you embed your CSS in your page or externalize it  put it in a separate .css file ?    Answer: Sometimes for testing I put the CSS in my page where I can have visibility to all the rules  and properties, but this generally isn’t a good idea because it makes CSS rules less reusable and more  difficult to maintain. Inline CSS looks like this:         header,nav,footer,article,section {margin:5px;}  header,nav,footer {border:1px solid 000;}  section {border:1px dotted green;}         When you want to externalize your CSS there are two ways: one is to link your document via the     tag, and the second is to import your document via the @import rule.      As a good practice you externalize your CSS via a   tag. The   tag must be embedded in the    of your document and has the three main attributes:   rel: Specifies the relationship between the linked document and the current one.   type: Specifies the mime type of the linked document.   href: Specifies the URL of the linked document.   media: Specifies on what kind of device the linked document will be displayed.                Companion Site Reference   Example 3-1: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter3 basics1.php   An example of a linked CSS document for all media can be seen below:             As a side note, when documents are linked you can reduce the amount of data your browser will   need to download via minification and gzip compression.   42       CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING     Note  Minification and compression allow you to shrink the content sent to the browser. So rather than sending  a 100k CSS file to your browser the server sends a 3k css.gz  Gzip  file to your browser.    Mobile Safari supports compressed formats for both JavaScript and CSS files. You can search on “apache  mod_deflate” as a means of automatically compressing CSS files.   @import  Another way to externalize your CSS files is to reference other CSS sheets from within a master  stylesheet.   Companion Site Reference   Example 3-2: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter3 basics2.php        @import url "css basic.css"       I would avoid using this if you can, mainly because of performance. It takes longer for the import   method to render than the link tag.   Most of the CSS in the examples in this chapter can be found in the files sample.css and   chapter3.css, except for Example 3-4, where I’ve put all the CSS in the main file so you can see it all side  by side.    The Structure of CSS  CSS always has the following structure.   selector {property: value;}               Selectors are alphanumeric and can be an element ID  ID , an element className   .class , an element name  table , or a combination  h1.title .   Properties identify what rule is being set. The list of properties is large, and  includes things such as border, color, padding, margin, and the like.   Values are assigned to each property. But only certain values are appropriate for  certain elements and properties. So you would not be able to set the color to a  value of 10 px  10 pixels .   CSS Browser Extensions  A lot of times in CSS you’ll see strange prefixes in front of normal selectors; for example, instead of:   border-radius:10px;    43    CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING      you’ll see:   Extension  -ms-   -moz-   -webkit-   -o-   -webkit-border-radius:10px;   These are called browser-specific extensions. The extensions for the browser rendering engines and   their associated browsers are shown in Table 3-1.   Table 3-1. CSS Browser Extensions   Rendering Engine  Trident   Browsers  Internet Explorer   Mozilla   Webkit   Presto   Firefox   Opera   Safari, Mobile Safari, Chrome     Special Extensions for Mobile Safari  There are almost a hundred –webkit extensions for iOS. One that you  might want to use on your iOS device is –webkit-tap-highlight-color. This overrides the highlight color when a user  taps a link or other clickable element.   You can get a complete list of –webkit extensions for iOS at a website called: CSS Infos.  http:  css-infos.net   properties webkit.php    Media Queries and Media Selectors   If you can tell what device or media your site is being viewed on, you can use that information to assign a  customized stylesheet. Back in HTML4 there were the following media types that could be listed as part  of the   tag. So, for instance, you could assign different style rules for displaying your site on a TV  screen versus a handheld device. These media types are still in use and they are:                               all   aural   braille   handheld   projection   print   screen   tty   tv   44       CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING   With HTML5, you can go a step further and specify rules within the media attribute to detect more  specific information such as screen size and orientation. We access this information about the browser  via a media query. The following tags are available.   device-aspect-ratio   width   height   device-width   device-height   orientation    aspect-ratio   color   color-index   monochrome   orientation   resolution   scan   grid                                                 min-device-pixel-ratio   The bold-face query properties in this list are the ones we use when determining whether we’re on   an iPhone, iPhone4  Retina , or an iPad, so we use these later in the book.   orientation  This media query option allows you to link different CSS documents based on the orientation of your  device. The two orientations available are portrait and landscape.   Companion Site Reference   Example 3-3: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.   http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter3 orient.php   For portrait you would use the following media query.             45    CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING      Table 3-2. Display sizes  portrait   Device  iPhone   iPhone4  retina    iPad   * See note on Retina Display   Device W  cid:1  H  320  cid:1  480   640  cid:1  960   768  cid:1  1024   Table 3-3. Display sizes  landscape    Device  iPhone   iPhone4  retina    iPad   * See note for Retina display.   such as the following.   Device W  cid:1  H  480  cid:1  320   960  cid:1  640   1024  cid:1  768   Working W  cid:1  H  320  cid:1  356   320  cid:1  356*   768  cid:1  928   Working W  cid:1  H  480  cid:1  208   480  cid:1  208*   1024  cid:1  672   For landscape you would use the following media query.       So if you would like to change styles based on portrait or landscape, you would use an HTML header           Some Title                            Optionally you could create a single   to a CSS and then modify the CSS to contain the media   query such as   header,nav,footer {border-radius:5px;border:1px solid 000;margin:5px;}  @media  orientation:portrait  {      header {background-color:silver;color:black;}  }  @media  orientation:landscape  {      header {background-color:black;color:silver;}  }   For my own app, the grandviewave mobile site, I’ve decided to use only portrait styles.   46    CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING      or   device-width  Although not mentioned above there are two additional subproperties of device-width. Those are: min- device-width, and max-device-width. The min-device-width for an iPhone is 320 px, because while in  portrait orientation its width is 320 px and when in landscape it’s 480 px.   You might think that an iPhone with Retina Display would show up differently, however, both the   iPhone and iPhone4 give the same value from the media query.   @media screen and   min-device-width: 320px  {…}   But because this query will also work for the iPhone4, you will need to use another media query to   investigate the pixel ratio. This is a -webkit- specific property selector.   -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio  So just as there are special extensions for webkit for CSS properties, there are also extensions for media  queries. These will give you the ability to detect if you’re on an iPhone or iPod Touch with a Retina Display.   <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and  -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:2 " cid:1    href="hires.css">   @media screen and  -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:2 {  ...  }   Now in order to tell if you are on each of the following it gets a little tricky because some of these will   hold true for multiple media devices.    Media Selector Example  The first two media selectors highlight if the device is in portrait or landscape mode.   The third set of css properties sets the display of the   tags to none.  The remaining media queries select for the iPhone4, iPad, and iPhone, respectively.   Companion Site Reference   Example 3-4: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.     http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter3 iosselect.php   If you run this on the companion site, you’ll see text highlighted that will tell you what device you’re   on and what orientation you’re in.                Some Title    47    CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING              @media  orientation:portrait  {          .portrait {display:block;}          .landscape {display:none;}  }   @media  orientation:landscape  {      .landscape {display:block;}          .portrait {display:none;}  }     default display none  .iphone4 {display:none;}  .iphone {display:none;}  .ipad {display:none;}     iphone4  @media screen and  -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:2  {      .iphone4 {display:block;}  }     ipad  @media screen and  min-device-width: 768px {      .ipad {display:block;color:green;}  }     regular i  @media screen and  -webkit-max-device-pixel-ratio : 1.5  and  max-device-width: 480px {      .iphone {display:block;}  }            Landscape    Portrait    iPad    iPhone    iPhone4          Normally you would put these in an external CSS, but I just put everything in one document so you   can see it all together.   NOTE ON THE RETINA DISPLAY   The retina display is a little confusing. The iPhone media selectors still return a max-device-width  of 480  px even though the device has a pixel count of 960 when in landscape mode.  With the Retina Display it’s not the pixels on the screen that matter, it’s the resolution or the DPI of those  pixels. The DPI of the iPhone and iPod Touch is 163. The DPI of the Retina Display is 326. The DPI of the  iPad is 132.   48       CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING   So how do you program this on your web app? Actually it’s very easy. Let’s say you want to display a 300  pixel image on the home page; rather than creating a 300  cid:1  300 pixel image you just create a 600  cid:1  600  pixel image then scale it down to 300  cid:1  300 via the height and width properties of the image or a CSS rule  for that element. Because of the pixel density, your 600  cid:1  600 pixel image will be remarkably clear  compared to the 300 pixel version.  You can view an example of this by going to the following page with your iPhone Retina Display or iPhone  simulator  Retina . This is Example 3-5 on the companion site.   http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter3 retina.html  You can also find out more about the Retina Display on the Apple site.   Next we go over the important parts of CSS3 and iPhone-specific styling to make our app look and   feel like a native app.   Saving to the Home Screen   In order to add your web app to the iOS home screen you will need four things.   Start-Up Splash Image      Home Screen Icon        Metatag for “Full Screen”     Metatag for the style bar color   First we need to add some icons via specialized link and rel attributes.       This icon will need to be 57  cid:1  57 pixels for the iPhone, 114  cid:1  114 for the iPhone  Retina , and 72  cid:1    This tells iOS to use my-icon.png as the icon for the home screen. Next we need to add a start-up   72 for the iPad.   image.       This image will need to be 320  cid:1  460 for the iPhone, 640  cid:1  920 for the iPhone  Retina , and 768  cid:1    1004 for the iPad Portrait, or 1024  cid:1  748 for the iPad Landscape. This is the image that will be displayed  on the start-up splash screen when the web app loads.   Next we need to tell the web app to use the entire screen by removing the address bar and coloring   the status bar.  We talked about these in Chapter 1.        and       There are three options for the content value  default, black, black-translucent .  Now in order to add your app to the home screen you just need to press the bookmark icon in the   center of the Safari, or click the plus sign next to the address bar.   49    CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING      Figure 3-1. Add to Home Screen      A Short Overview of CSS3   Next I provide a short reference to CSS3. Mobile Safari supports most of these attributes natively so  there’s no need for the -webkit- prefix.   Animation  In CSS3 you can create animations without the need for Flash or JavaScript. To use animations you must  use the CSS @keyframes rule, then specify the properties on the element that is doing the animation.   The example below sets the animation to run after two seconds and repeat forever. For example,   @-webkit-keyframes mytest {     from {background: ccc;} to {background: 000;}   }     50    CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING      div {    -webkit-animation-name: mytest;    -webkit-animation-duration: 3s;    -webkit-animation-timing-function: linear;    -webkit-animation-delay: 2s;    -webkit-animation-iteration-count: infinite;    -webkit-animation-direction: alternate;  }   I can see animations being used when creating effects, and what’s really nice is that it does not   require JavaScript or a JavaScript framework like jQuery.   Backgrounds  There are a few changes as to how backgrounds are handled in CSS3 some of which will really help you  when styling your iOS app.   Multiple Backgrounds  You can now specify multiple backgrounds for an element by adding comma-delimited background  images.   background:url 'img1.png' ,url 'img2.png' ;   You might typically use multiple backgrounds when you want a really nice effect or would like to   combine a gradient with an image.   Clipping Backgrounds  This allows you to specify the painted area of the background of the element based on one of three  settings:            border-box  the default : Clipped to the border   padding-box: Clipped to the padding   content-box: Clipped to the content   background-clip: content-boxborder-boxcontent-box ;   You would typically use the clipping property of a background when you need some customization   on the placement of your background from within an element.   Background Origin  This specifies the positioning of the background image.   background-origin: padding-boxborder-boxcontent-box;   placement of your background.   Background Size  This specifies the size of the background images.   As with clipping, you would typically use the origin property when you need to customize the   51   f   CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING      background-size:width height;   In addition, it gives you the ability to resize a background just as you would do with an image.   Webkit Properties  There are also some webkit-based functions that allow you to create backgrounds dynamically,  specifically, -webkit-gradient. For instance:   background: -webkit-linear-gradient left, ccc, 000 ;   This allows you to specify a linear gradient from top to bottom with the colors ccc  gray  to 000    black .   There are other webkit properties you can choose, each with a similar syntax.    Borders  With CSS3 you can add shadows to boxes, use an image as a border, or just round the edges.   Border Shadow  To create a shadow around an element use the following.   box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px ccc;   The first two attributes are required. These are the horizontal and vertical positions of the shadow.   Optionally you can select the blur distance, shadow size, shadow color, and if the shadow is outer or  inner to the element.   Border Image  This allows you to use an image as a border.   border-image:url border_img.png  25 25 round;   Where the source is a url  , the image slice is the inward offset to the image, the width of the image  border, or the outset of the border image beyond the border box, and repeat specifies whether it should  be repeated, stretched, or rounded.   Rounded Borders  You can just simply round out the borders of your elements. You can also specify corners with border- top-left-radius, border-top-right-radius, border-bottom-left-radius, and border-bottom-right- radius.   border-radius:10px;  -webkit-border-radius-top-left:8px;   You would typically use this either by itself or with a custom selector to round part of an element  as   within an iPhone-styled list shown later .   Fonts  Prior to CSS3 websites had to use the installed fonts on the user’s computer. That’s no longer the case;  by creating the font-face rule you can specify the font to download. For example:   52    CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING      @font-face {          font-family: testFont;          src: url 'myFont.ttf' ;  }    .class {          font-family:testFont;  }   Additional font descriptors are:              font-stretch: Normal  default , condensed, ultra-condensed, extra-condensed,  semi-condensed, expanded, semi-expanded, extra-expanded, ultra-expanded   font-style: Normal  default , italic, oblique   font-weight: Normal  default , bold, 100–900   2D 3D Transforms  Now you can move, stretch, rotate, and scale elements via CSS. Some of the methods you can use on  your elements are defined below.   Matrix  This combines all the transform methods into one by using six values that take the form of the top two  rows, mathematically a 3  cid:1  3 matrix.   A matrix of:   a b c  d e f  0 0 1   would take the form:   .class {    transform: matrix  a,b,c,d,e,f ;     transform: matrix3d  a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p ;  }   This gets rather complicated unless you’re a math geek. Rather I move on to a few examples that are   a little more intuitive. For 3D the matrix is 4  cid:1  4 and has 16 values.   Rotate  This rotates an element.   .class {    transform: rotate  45deg ;     transform: rotate3d  30,30,30,30deg ;  }   Here you can rotate 2D by specifying the degrees of rotation, or for 3D you need to specify a unit   vector of x, y, and z, followed by a degree of rotation.   53    CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING      Scale  This scales an element either larger or smaller and takes the form scale  1.5,2  which would increase the  x component by 1.5 times and the y component by 2 times. You can also specify an individual axis with  skewX, skewY, and skewZ. Or all three axes via scale3d x,y,z .   Skew  Skew requires a little more imagination to comprehend. The following method skew 30deg,45deg  will  rotate the element 30 degrees around the x-axis and 45 degrees around the y-axis.   Translate  This essentially moves your element by an x- and y-coordinate. You can either combine them  or call  them separately. An example takes the form:   .myClass {    transform:translate 100px,100px ;    2d    transform:translate3d 100px,100px,100px ;    3d    transform:translateX 100px ;    x coordinate    transform:translateY 100px ;    y coordinate    transform:translate 100px ;    z coordinate  }   Transitions  Transitions allow us to create an effect when transitioning from one style to the next. Let’s say, for  example, you’re wanting to create a :hover effect on an element so that when the mouse is over an  element you may change its color in some cases, or may even change its height or width.    The original element would be, let’s say 50 pixels, but on :hover it might stretch to 100 pixels. Rather  than having this element snap to 100 pixels we create a transition between element and element:hover.   You can either use the transition   property for everything, or you can use the properties   individually.                    transition  property duration timing-function delay    transition-property: The name of the CSS property to which the transition is  applied   transition-duration: The duration of the transition   transition-timing-function: The speed of the transition   transition-delay: The delay before the transition starts   An example of use is:   .class {    width:50px;    transition: width 1s linear 2s;  }  .class:hover {    width:100px;  }   54    CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING      feel.   Text Effects  There are many new text properties with CSS3; the ones we care most about when styling our iOS app  are the text shadow and word wrap properties.   Text Shadow  The text shadow simply adds a shadow to the text with the following format,   text-shadow: horz-shadow vert-shadow blur color;   where the horz-shadow and vert-shadow represent the horizontal and vertical shadows, the blur  represents the blur distance, and the color is the color of the shadow.   h1.title {text-shadow:2px 2px ccc;}   Typically I would use a text shadow for text in a header or a button to give it a more native look and   Word Wrap  This permits you to allow an element that might have unbreakable words broken so that content does  not scroll unintentionally.   Article {word-wrap:break-word;}   There are other text properties defined in CSS3 including: hanging-punctuation, punctuation-trim,   text-align-last, text-emphasis, text-justify, text-outline, text-overflow, text-wrap, and word-break.  This concludes a short reference of what’s new in CSS3. Next we take what we’ve learned from CSS3   and apply it to making our ugly web app look like an iOS app.   Styling for iOS   Making our web app look like a native iPhone or iPad app is critical to its design. The main reason is that  users are used to interacting with these devices in a certain way. Although you could make your  application “work” without any iOS styling whatsoever, your adoption curve will take a serious hit.   What I do over the remainder of the chapter is show you how to perform some basic iOS styling   techniques such as styling a list and button, or making use of the overflow and fixed positioning.   Styling a Header  All you need to do to create a header is add some CSS. I’ve added this to the file   chapter3 css sample.css.   Companion Site Reference   Example 3-6: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.     http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter3 sample_header.php   55    CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING      header {      text-align: center;      height: 50px;      background-image: -webkit-gradient linear, left top, left bottom, from 444 , to 000  ;  }    header h1 {      color: fff;  }   This will add a dark background with a gradient, and center an H1 with a white font.   Styling a List  Take a look at Figure 3-2. How do you make a list go from a plain list  on the left  to an iPhone-styled list   on the right ?   Figure 3-2.

I have added these to   chapter3 css sample.css.    nav ul {    remove list style      list-style:none;      margin:10px;      padding:0;  }  nav ul li a {    give some color and a border      background-color:fff;      border: 1px solid 999;      color:222;      display:block;      font-weight:bold;      margin-bottom:-1px;      padding: 12px 10px;      text-decoration:none;  }  nav ul.num2 li:first-child a {    create a rounded border on top      border-top-left-radius:8px;      border-top-right-radius:8px;  }  nav ul.num2 li:last-child a {    create a rounded border on the bottom      border-bottom-left-radius:8px;   57    Step 3: Add the Chevron  Second we just need to add the chevron to the right of the image. For that I need to create a background  image on the   tag because that’s the element that was positioned. Then I just size the background and  position it.   CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING       border-bottom-right-radius:8px;  }   li.arrow a {      background-image: url chevron_36.png ;      background-size:22px;      background-position: right center;      background-position-x: 98%;      background-position-y: 50%;      background-repeat: no-repeat;      background-repeat-x: no-repeat;      background-repeat-y: no-repeat;  }   That’s it. You can do more with the colors of the list and add transition effects, but we talk about that   later on. Next we create a button.   Creating a Button  Now I show you how to convert a plain button  on the left of Figure 3-3  to an iPhone-styled button  on  the right .   Companion Site Reference   Example 3-9: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.     http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter3 sample_buttons.php   58       CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING   Figure 3-3. Plain button and link  left  iPhone-styled button  right       Step 1: Create the HTML  This is the basic HTML for Figure 3-3. You can see from the CSS below how you go from PLAIN to iOS.       Button    Checkout    Links    Back        Step 2: Size, Color, and Shadow the Buttons  This is the easy part; we just size and color the button and link, then apply a text-shadow to the text.   59    CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING      .button,.back {      font-size:16px;      line-height:18px;      text-shadow: 333 1px 1px 2px;      color:white;      font-weight:bold;      text-decoration:none;      border-width:10px;      padding:5px 10px;  }   Step 3: Add Border Images  Next I use the -webkit-border-image property to apply the round.png image to the border of the entire  element. This means I can now stretch this image over the entire element. For the button, I just take a  round image and stretch it until it fits the entire length of the text within the element. For the back  button I need to do a little modification of the size so that it fits neatly inside the image.   .button {      -webkit-border-image: url "round.png"  0 14 0 14 stretch;  }  .back {      height:30px;      line-height:14px;      font-weight:normal;      font-size:12px;      padding:5px;      color:fff;      -webkit-border-image: url "back.png"  0 14 0 14 stretch;  }   Overflow  iOS5   In versions previous to iOS5 you had to perform a three-finger swipe to activate an area with overflow.  This made it very difficult or impossible to get fixed positioning of elements from within the window of  Mobile Safari but, more important, it was not intuitive.   iPhone Fixed Footer Example  All you need to do now is measure your working area and add the overflow properties to your element.   nav {      height: 250px;      overflow-y: auto;      -webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch;  }    footer {      position: absolute;      top: 300;      border: 1px solid red;   60    CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING          width: 300px;      margin: 10px;      height: 40px;  }   The example above creates an overflow for the navigation and a fixed footer.   iPad Split View Example  Here’s an example on the iPad of how to create a split-view page. This allows you to take the navigation  and put it on the left 30% of the page and then take the main content and display it on the right 70%. You  can even add the overflow and webkit-content-scrolling properties to the   element to give it a  more native look and feel.    In Figure 3-4 I’ve added a border and a few more contact links to show you how it is scrolling on an   iPad. When you touch this part of the screen it actually shows you a scrollbar as you’re moving your finger.   Companion Site Reference   Example 3-10: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter3 ipad.php   Figure 3-4. iPad Split View      61    CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING      Putting It All Together   We left off with the Grandview Web App in a rather ugly state. It was nothing more than some HTML5  mark-up and a few ideas about how we wanted the navigation to work. But now thanks to CSS3 we can  start to make it look like a native iPhone or iPad app.   There are two main things we want to take from this section and apply to your app: device and  orientation selection and how to make our web app act like an app and add it to our home screen.   Device and Orientations  You can have up to six different combinations of devices and orientations for your mobile web app. For  Grandview Ave I just pick two: iPhone Portrait and iPad Landscape. I also add a special selector for  Retina Display devices so that the images and icons that I use can have twice the resolution.   I chose these two after reviewing the log statistics from my site and finding that those two profiles   were responsible for over 90% of my mobile views. Because of this I won’t need to create a separate  stylesheet and I also don’t want to incur the additional network call. I just put everything in a single  stylesheet called grandviewave.css like this:       This means that I need to create the following media selectors.    ** iphone **   @media screen and  -webkit-max-device-pixel-ratio : 1.5  and  max-device-width: 480px {  }   ** iphone 4 **   @media screen and  -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:2  {  }   ** ipad **   @media screen and  min-device-width: 768px {  }   With these media selectors I can have a common area of CSS at the top and the device-specific   selectors down below within the media query sections defined above.   Full Screen Web App  Next because I want to add my app as a full-screen web app I need to add the metatags and images to  my site. I use the   tags to say this is web app capable and then use the   tags in combination  with the media selectors to pick the right images.   <link rel="apple-touch-startup-image"   media=" max-device-width: 480px  and not  -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2 "   href="iphone.png"  >    <link rel="apple-touch-startup-image"   media=" max-device-width: 480px  and  -webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2 "   href="iphone4.png"  >    <link rel="apple-touch-startup-image"   media=" max-device-width: 1024px  and  orientation: portrait "   href="ipad-portrait.png"  >     62    CHAPTER 3    CSS3 AND IOS STYLING   <link rel="apple-touch-startup-image"   media=" max-device-width: 1024px  and  orientation: landscape "   href="ipad-landscape.png"  >   The remaining item I need to finish  in addition to the content and data  is the navigation. I put the   finishing touches on that in Chapter 6.   Chapter Summary   In this chapter I gave you an overview of CSS3 and iPhone- iPad-specific media-kit-based rendering  tricks to make your web app look like a native iPhone or iPad app.   This list is not comprehensive. In fact for Grandview Ave I actually use a Mobile Framework   discussed in Chapter 5, but what you’ve learned in this chapter will allow you to roll your own mobile  framework or modify an existing one.   Before moving on to the next chapter you should know how to do the following.   Externalize your CSS.         Use Media Queries to better customize your CSS for properties such as orientation   or device-width.   Save your iPhone or iPad web app to the home screen.         Use some of the basics of the new features in CSS3.         Style a native-looking list and buttons.   Take advantage of overflow for iOS 5.   Now that we know how to make your web app look good, it’s time to talk about how to make it   functional and get data from our web site. That will involve JavaScript and that’s what I talk about next.                                                63    C H A P T E R  4               JavaScript and APIs   There’s a lot to know about JavaScript and the APIs of HTML5. So much so it’s not really possible to go  over everything. However, there’s a lot we can cover that’s important to mobile development. Many of  the things I talk about can be achieved by using a JavaScript framework such as jQuery, which is  introduced at the end of the chapter, but first you need to know the basics of what’s under the hood so  you can deviate from a framework or fix problems when they come up.   The first thing to look at is the basics of JavaScript: things such as how to include and reference   external JavaScript files as well as some basics for creating JavaScript objects and methods. Next I go into  some of the JavaScript events you’ll use over and over.   Finally I talk about how to roll your own AJAX objects and a little about JSON  JavaScript Object   Notation  for retrieving remote data. We use PHP to handle the remote data in Grandview Ave, but you  could use HTML, Ruby, JSON, Python, .NET, anything really. The important thing is that we’re getting  remote data and bringing them in via AJAX.   Before getting into the APIs and items above, I will stray a little bit into the history of JavaScript   because the structure of the language is vital to everything we want to do and it’s especially important  when comparing JavaScript to a server-side language.   About JavaScript   JavaScript is a unique language. I will give you a little bit of an overview of JavaScript because I think it  goes a long way in understanding the way frameworks and things work in JavaScript as compared to  Objective-C, C, C++, Java, Ruby, PHP, or .C languages. When frameworks break or a problem comes up,  many web developers get stuck because they ignore much of this information.   JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape in 1995, and is an implementation   of the ECMAScript language standard. Other dialects of ECMAScript include Jscript and ActionScript.  The current edition of ECMAScript is 5 and the current JavaScript version is 1.8.5.   JavaScript is a scripting language. Scripting languages control one or more applications. There are   many types of scripting languages. Some are for shells such as bash or batch files. Other languages  including Perl started out as scripting languages but became more powerful. But because scripting  languages by definition control one or more applications, JavaScript controls the web browser application.   JavaScript is dynamic as opposed to static. Dynamic languages are a class of programming   languages that execute at runtime and can change their composition while running. This is more than  just modifying the state of certain variables: dynamic languages can add code and extend objects, all  during the course of program execution making the distinction between code and data difficult.   JavaScript is weakly typed as opposed to strongly typed. Weakly typed languages essentially just  allow you to not specify the type for a variable. So the variable foo can be set to an integer, a string, a  double, or an array and can change during the course of program execution.   65    CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS      JavaScript is object-oriented. This is a style of programming performed with objects or complex data  structures that are composed of variables and methods. Those variables and methods provide an object  with certain behavior.   JavaScript is prototype-based. Prototype-based means that you create objects by cloning other   objects rather than instantiating objects from a class  template .   JavaScript is a functional language. A functional language is one that treats computer programs   similar to mathematical functions. This is a 10-dollar word for a 10-cent concept. Basically it just means  that if you pass a variable to a function, it returns another variable. All states are contained within the  function’s input variables.   JavaScript has first-class functions. A first-class function basically means you can pass in a function   to another function. This can best be seen in the example below.   Companion Site Reference   Example 4-1: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter4 jsfunction.php      normal function  function foo a, b  { return a + b; }     normal function as variable  var foo2 = function a,b  { return a+b; }     function as parameter to another function  function foo3 foo2,a,b  {      return foo2 a,b ;  }     outputs 3,3,3  alert foo 1,2 +","+foo2 1,2 +","+foo3 foo2,1,2  ;   Based on your style of programming and background you may prefer to use an object-oriented   approach or a functional approach. This is known as multiparadigm. Some JavaScript libraries might be  entirely function-based, whereas others will be more object-oriented. Either way there’s a lot to learn  about the language; next I talk about a few useful parts.   Using JavaScript   There’s a lot to talk about in JavaScript. I recommend getting one of the fine Apress books on just  JavaScript by itself to learn all the ins and outs of the language. But in lieu of that I touch on some of the  most useful parts of the language, specifically the parts we need for creating our mobile web app.   Externalizing JavaScript  Just as in Chapter 3 when we externalized, minified, and gzipped CSS, we can do the same with JavaScript.   Inline JavaScript would look like this:      function foo   {...}      66       CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS   Externalized JavaScript would look like this:        It’s important to note that JavaScript executes as soon as it’s loaded, so the order of loading is   important. If you have two JavaScript files and one is dependent on the other, say you have function  foo   in external.js, you can’t call foo before it’s loaded; you’ll get an object not found error.   Creating Objects and Using Namespaces  There are a few ways to design a JavaScript library: one is to create a bunch of global functions, and  another is to create JavaScript objects or namespaces for your custom functions. Take a look at the  following example.   Companion Site Reference   Example 4-2: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter4 objects.php   var a = 0;  function add_a   {           a=a+1;  }  add_a  ;  add_a  ;  alert "a = " + a ;    function something   {           a = "a string";  }  something  ;  alert "a = " + a ;   var b = new Object  ;  b.count = 0;  b.add = function   {   In the example above, the global variable a starts off as an integer, and ends up as a string. Now   imagine if this function or global variable were used inside an external library or rather what if you had  name collisions from two different external libraries? This would get quite difficult to debug. To avoid  this we create objects or use namespaces.     Note  The variable $ is used by many JavaScript frameworks including jQuery. Make sure you don’t use this  variable if you’re using a JavaScript framework.   67    CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS          this.count = this.count+1;  }  b.add  ;  b.add  ;  alert "b = "+b.count ;   increment it by the method add.   In the above example, we just create an object and set a property of count on that object and   Now we can do whatever we want to b and it will just be for b and we don’t need to worry about this  unless b is a global variable used in an external library that we’ve imported. As you can see the method of  creating objects is rather easy; you just need to declare a variable as an object and then add properties to  it, followed by methods  functions .   Events  Events are actions that can be detected such as scrolling your window, clicking a button, or focusing on  an element. I talk about a few below that you’ll want to make use of when building your mobile web app.   The first events I talk about are how to recognize when your page is done being loaded, because   most of the time this is when you’ll want to start doing things.   window.onload and DOMContentLoaded  I have not been able to tell the difference in timing between the two, but don’t use window.onload, even if  you’re just using mobile safari. The reason is that some browsers fire the window.onload event when  everything is loaded just like document.body.onload, but mobile safari seems to fire this event when the  DOM is ready.   The preferred method of checking to see whether the DOM is ready for manipulation is to check to   see if it’s loaded. You can do that via the following event handler function.   document.addEventListener 'DOMContentLoaded', domready   ;   If you are using external JavaScript or waiting for images to load so you can manipulate them, this  event will fire too early. In these cases, you’ll want to use the onload attribute in the   tag instead.   body.onload  The body.onload event fires when all of the items on a page are finished loading. This means all external  files including CSS, JavaScript, and Images.     Note  Be careful when calling third-party APIs. The onload event will not fire until these are done loading,  which could take some time.   The following example demonstrates the difference in timing between body onload and   DOMContentLoaded by printing an alert when each event occurs. Because of the speed of today’s browsers  I’ve used a 10-megabyte image file to slow things down.   68    CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS   Companion Site Reference   Example 4-3: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter4 load.php               document.addEventListener 'DOMContentLoaded', domready   ;  function bodyload   {      alert 'body load' ;  }  function domready   {      alert 'dom ready' ;  }           Note  The iOS is limited to 10-megabyte files for images, CSS, or other resources. Make sure you limit your files  to this size otherwise they will not be downloaded.   window.onhashchange  What’s the hash? Well the hash is the part of your URL after the  sign. So if your URL is  http:  domain.com resource.php123, the location.hash would be 123. This is a useful feature when you  are using the location.hash as a means of maintaining state on your web page and you’re dynamically  loading parts of the page via AJAX.   In the URL Example http:  domain.com business.php123, the 123 could be the primary key in the  database row of businesses. If your user clicked the back button and it was 122, you might want to load  the content again for business 122.   Before JavaScript included this event we had to create a timer that would look for changes in the   location.hash value every few hundred milliseconds.   window.onorientationchange  In Chapter 3 we showed you how to detect your browser’s orientation via a media query in the   tag. But what if you want to do more with your app besides change the style of the web page? Well, you  use this event window.onorientationchange.   69    CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS      Companion Site Reference   Example 4-4: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter4 orient.php   window.onorientationchange = function   {      alert "orientation = " + window.orientation ;  }   The following are the orientation values and position of the iOS device.   0 – Portrait mode   90 – Landscape mode  button on the right    –90 – Landscape mode  button on the left    The orientation does not read upside-down orientations  button on the top .   Dialogs  The following three dialog types work in iOS  see Figure 4.1 .   Companion Site Reference   Example 4-5: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter4 dialog.php   alert string  – This returns a void and allows the user to press OK to  acknowledge the alert. You might use this to display simple confirmation  messages or feedback to your user.   confirm string  – This also displays a message but returns a true if OK is clicked  and a false if Cancel is clicked. You might use this to ask for Boolean feedback,  without the fanciness of an HTML dialog.   prompt string  – This also displays a message but returns a string depending on  what the user has entered. You might use this in place of an HTML form for simple  input.                         70       CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS   Figure 4-1. Different dialogs as displayed on the iPhone   I often use the alert box to show some debugging information, but there’s another way to get even   more detailed information and that’s by using the JavaScript console.      Safari JavaScript Console  First and foremost make sure your debugging console is turned on  see Chapter 1, Figure 1-2.   Next there are four kinds of messages that will appear on your debugging console:   log – General log messages   info –  Informational messages            warning – Warnings that do not cause breakage      error – Errors that could cause the page to break and stop working.   Companion Site Reference   Example 4-6: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter4 console.php   71    CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS      You can see how those messages look in the code below and in Figure 4-2.   console.log "this is a log message" ;  console.info "this is an info message" ;  console.warn "this is a warning message" ;  console.error "this is an error message" ;      Figure 4-2. Console messages   Creating an API    When creating an API it’s important to think how you’re going to use it. For our app, Grandview Ave, I  use it for two things, simplifying application design for multiple devices and to publish data to multiple  web sites and apps. Let’s list these below.         72    CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS      Device-Centric Usage      Mobile iPad site     Mobile iPhone site     Other mobile site  Android and Blackberry      Native iPhone app     Native iPad app     Native Android app   Data-Centric Usage   Publish HTML content to mobile site   Publish business category data   Publish business detail data                   Near Me functionality       Sales and specials   Parking data   The back-end for your API can be anything you want; for my examples I use PHP to create a RESTful   web service or API.     REST  Representation State Transfer   REST basically means that you have a URL where you can GET, PUT,  POST, and DELETE data. The URL defines the data, and the methods define what you want to do with them.   An example could be: http:  domain.com resource.html or  http:  domain.com resource business.php?id=1.    Once you lay out the URLs and files you’re going to use to provide these data to your mobile site or   app, you’ll need a way to get the data, and we do that with AJAX.   Getting Remote Data with AJAX  AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML and it was first implemented by Microsoft in Internet  Explorer 5 as an ActiveX object named XMLHttpRequest. The idea behind this was simple: provide rich  functionality to a browser by requesting XML from a URL and then parsing this XML on the browser with  VBScript or JavaScript to spice up the interface so developers would not need to run ActiveX or Java in  their browsers.   This object was later added to Safari and has the syntax:   var httpReq = new XMLHttpRequest  ;   The XMLHttpRequest object has the following methods.   73    CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS                                                        open method GET  POST , url, true asynchronous   false  synchronous ,  username, password  – Opens the request and makes the request if a GET   send   – Sends the request   abort   – Cancels the current request   getAllResponseHeaders   – Returns all HTTP headers as a string   setRequestHeaders label,value  – Sets the request headers to be sent in the  request   This object also has an event listener called onreadystatechange; this event fires for each of the ready   states below:   0 – Uninitialized.   1 – Opened, but send not called.   2 – Opened, send has been called.   3 – Receiving; this is when response is being downloaded.   4 – Loaded, or finished receiving response.   The object also has the following properties containing the downloaded response.   responseText – Just a string of the response.   responseXML – The response as XML.   responseBody – The response as a binary encoded string.   status – The status code of the response: 200 indicates OK; 404 would be “file not  found”.   statusText – The status text such as “not found” or “ok”.   Here’s a simple AJAX example that makes a call to a local file called simple.txt, and it will alert the   contents of this file to the screen.   Companion Site Reference   Example 4-7: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter4 ajax.php       var req = new XMLHttpRequest  ;      var url = "sample.txt";      req.open "GET", url ;      req.onreadystatechange =  function   {          if  req.readyState == 4  {              }      };      req.send  ;       var txt = req.responseText;      alert txt ;   74    CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS      functions.   Since AJAX was invented there have been other kinds of data in addition to XML that have been sent   back via XMLHttpRequest: Plain Text, HTML, CSV  Comma Separated Values , and JSON  JavaScript  Object Notation .   It’s also important to note that all the major JavaScript frameworks use this object for their AJAX   Response Data Matrix  Table 4-1 shows a few sample data types with pros and cons of each.   Table 4-1. Pros and Cons of Different Response Data   Data Type  Mime Type   Pro   Con   Plain Text   text Plain   Simple, good for simple  messages.   Not readily parsed for complicated  data types.   HTML   text HTML   Good for injecting as dynamic  content.   Not good for data as its markup is  not descriptive.   CSV   text CSV   Good for tables or large lists.   Not well suited for hierarchical  data.   XML   text XML   Can suit flat or hierarchical data,  easily parsed.   Quite verbose and deeply nested  data structures require lots of  syntax to get a single item.   JSON   application JSON   It’s JavaScript, not as verbose as  XML, and can easily map to  existing objects or flat data  structures.   Requires separate decorating  markup, as this is just data and  structure.   I think that each of these return types has its place in a RESTful API, but next we need to understand   a little bit more about JSON.   JSON  JavaScript Object Notation   JSON is basically structured text that transmits data in a form easily digestible and evaluated by  JavaScript using eval   or JSON.parse  . Although most of the time you end up using JSON with  JavaScript, it’s actually a language-independent data format like XML or YML. For a detailed overview of  JSON, Wikipedia has a nice example comparing it to XML: http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki JSON     Note  Although you could use the eval   method for evaluating JSON text, this makes your application vulner- able to injection or kinds of attacks. JSON.parse   is the new JSON object available as a safer alternative to eval.   75    CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS      When thinking about JSON just think of it as a class or an object but without a name. So rather than   creating a class named Person, with properties of id and name, just create the object with those  properties; it can be named whatever you want it to be.   Companion Site Reference   Example 4-8: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter4 json.php   Then to evaluate or parse this object  named JSON  just follow the steps below.   {      "id" : 1,      "name": "Scott"  }       var json = '{"id":1,"name":"Scott"}';      var obj1 = eval " "+json+" " ;      var obj2 = JSON.parse json ;      alert obj1.name + ", id= " + obj2.id ;   JSON has the following basic types.   String         Number     Boolean     Array     Object     Null or Empty      Date     Error     Math     Regular expressions      Function   JSON does not support the following native types.   So although it’s JavaScript, it’s best for representing JavaScript data, and that means you will not   need to parse XML. Now that we can get JSON or HTML data from our API how do we get it on the page?  That’s where DOM manipulation comes into play.   76       CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS   DOM Manipulation  Before HTML5 if you wanted to work with an element you would need to use the trusty getElementById  method.   If you recall in Chapter 2 I talked about some new selectors made possible by HTML5; you could   select this same element or you could select by either a class name or an id, or something else.          var elt = document.getElementById "foo" ;  elt.innerHTML = "this is cool";                 var elt1 = document.getElementsByClassName "someclass" ;  var elt2 = document.querySelector "foo" ;      or modify its contents.      var elt = document.getElementById "foo" ;  elt.innerHTML = "this is cool";  elt.style.color = "red";  elt.className = "newClass";      Now once you have an element you can manipulate it in many ways; usually you’ll change its style   When you combine AJAX, JSON, and DOM manipulation you get an externalized data file in the   form of JSON, retrieved through AJAX  XMLHttpRequest  and populated on the page via DOM  manipulation.   In the example below I have to use placeholder   tags populated from a JSON file requested   through AJAX.   Companion Site Reference   Example 4-9: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter4 combo.php   ID:      Name:              var req = new XMLHttpRequest  ;      var url = "sample.json";      var nameElt = document.getElementById "name" ;      var idElt =  document.getElementById "id" ;      var obj;   77    CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS          req.open "GET", url ;      req.onreadystatechange =  function   {              if  req.readyState == 4  {                  var json = req.responseText;                  obj = JSON.parse json ;                  idElt.innerHTML = obj.id;                  nameElt.innerHTML = obj.name;              }      };      req.send  ;        Note  Keep in mind that safari follows HTTP 1.1 and allows only four concurrent requests at a time, meaning  that if you have five objects on a page, the fifth object will be loaded once the first one is finished from the   first four.   Creating Elements and Adding Events  Another way to inject HTML into a document is just to create it with JavaScript. This has some benefit if  you don’t want to create the HTML from a JSON returned from an AJAX request.    This is an example of creating a red   with an onclick event handler that creates an alert box.   Companion Site Reference   Example 4-10: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter4 creating.php              var elt = document.createElement "div" ;      elt.onclick = function    {alert "new element" };      elt.style.border = "1px solid red";      elt.style.width = "200px";      elt.style.height = "200px";      elt.innerHTML = "click me";      document.body.appendChild elt ;      All of this is done with JavaScript and this kind of functionality will come in very handy later on.   JavaScript Frameworks   Up until now we’ve been doing everything manually: selecting the elements from the DOM we want to  work with, adding our event handlers, creating XMLHttpRequest objects, and looking for their ready state  to fire off events. But there’s another way to do this, which I mentioned back at the start of this chapter.   78    CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS   There are a bunch of great developers doing all this work so you don’t need to! I’m talking about  JavaScript Frameworks.   What’s a JavaScript Framework?  A JavaScript framework is more than just a library that allows you to do Ajax or has UI widgets; it has a  full stack of functionality, for example:   Ajax support      Cross browser support        DOM manipulation and traversal               Animation and effects   Event handling   Selectors   JSON   So you won’t need to code any of this yourself. And in addition, you will find that more developers  know how to create a jQuery Ajax request than know how to create an XMLHttpRequest object and wait  for the result to pass to a function.     Note  The Magic Dollar Sign $: All of the frameworks use a special character or words to denote usage of this  object function. For jQuery, Prototype, and MooTools it’s a dollar sign $, Yahoo! UI uses YAHOO and ExtJS uses Ext.   Some of the most popular JavaScript Frameworks include:                   jQuery – The most popular JavaScript framework and talked about more in  subsequent pages.   Prototype – A very popular framework created by Sam Stephenson in February of  2005.      MooTools – Originally an extension of the Prototype framework created by Valerio   Proietti in September of 2006.   YUI – The Yahoo! user interface library created in 2005 for use in creating user  interface components.   ExtJS – Originally created as an extension to YUI, it also includes interoperability  with jQuery and Prototype.   jQuery  jQuery was first released in January 2006 by John Resig and is the most popular JavaScript framework in  use today. We use this framework throughout the book. jQuery is free and open sourced, and dual  licensed under MIT License and GPL v2.   79    CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS      The current version of jQuery is 1.6.2 and it has a zipped size of 31Kb, and a minified size of 84K.The   web site for learning more about jQuery is http:  jquery.com.   To get jQuery to work all you need to do is download it from the web site and place it on your page   like in the example below.   Companion Site Reference   Example 4-11: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter4 jquery.php          $  .ready function  {      alert "jquery ready" ;   } ;        jQuery uses the syntax $  . This is the selector function to the jQuery library. Inside the    you put a   “selector” where a selector can be a CSS-style selector such as "id" or ".class", or even an entire  element type "a". An empty selector defaults to document so $   is the same as $ document .   After the selector you have methods that range from ready   for determining if the document is   ready, to effects such as hide or show.   Putting It All Together   Previously we figured out how to take a normal HTML page and frame it, style it, and use some HTML5  tags to organize it, but it’s still just a shell. The steps we need to take from this chapter are:      Creating a data API to access server data     Using Ajax to retrieve and populate the pages of our mobile app     Using the jQuery JavaScript framework for all the heavy work   Let’s look again at the data that we want to get from our API. Table 4-2 outlines our API components   along with their data types and URLs. I’ve used PHP to retrieve server-side data for Grandview Ave, but  you can use anything you want in your own apps, even HTML.   Table 4-2. API Overview of GrandviewAve  API Component   Data Type   Resource   Business Categories   List JSON or HTML    api categories.php   Business List   List JSON or HTML    api list.php?catid   Business Details   JSON or HTML    api detail.php?busid   80       CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS   API Component   Data Type   Resource   Business Near Me   List JSON or HTML    api nearme.php?latlong   Sales and Specials   List JSON or HTML    api sales.php   Parking   List JSON or HTML    api parking.php   The Avenue Hunt   Audio and Video   About   Contact   TBD   TBD   HTML   Text   —   —    api about.php    api contact.php   So far my directory structure looks like that shown in Figure 4-3.   Figure 4-3. Current GrandviewAve directory structure      I’ve got HTML files and I’ve put the associated PHP files that will handle the data in the  api   directory. You could put everything in the same location and just have .php files for everything, but I’m  organizing it like this because I will need the data-only parts in Chapter 15 when we convert Grandview   81    CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS      Ave to a native app. Now to bring in the data for an example page, say about.html, I need to add some  code like this.                About Grandview Ave               $  .ready function  {            $ "about" .load ' api about.php' .delay 500 .fadeIn 'slow' ;  } ;                        When you run this page in the ‘Putting It All Together’ section on the companion site, you’ll see I’ve   added a 500-millisecond delay and decided to fade-in the content slowly.   Now if this is not HTML and I want to bring in JSON for the list of categories, I might do something  such as this, with a JSON formatted PHP page returning dynamic data called categories.php. This is the  next example on the companion site.                Categories                   $  .ready function  {         $.getJSON ' api categories.php', function data  {          var items = [];            $.each data, function key, val  {              items.push ' ' + val + ' ' ;          } ;        $ ' ', {          'class': 'my-new-list',          html: items.join "           } .appendTo 'cats' ;          } ;      } ;                  82    CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS             Now iterating through the JSON is a little more complicated than just returning the HTML. You  might find that creating the HTML in JavaScript is a little awkward. If that’s the case then just create  HTML from your API and return it.    Now because I don’t want to have all of my JavaScript on each page I need to externalize it and   create some functions and device detection variables.         Note that I put the grandviewave.js file after jQuery. This is very important because there are   dependencies on jQuery and your page could show errors if reversed. So far my external JavaScript looks  like this.    js grandviewave.js as of Chapter 4   var isiPhone = navigator.userAgent.match  iPhone i ;  var isiPod = navigator.userAgent.match  iPod i ;  var isiPad = navigator.userAgent.match  iPad i ;    window.onhashchange = function   {}  window.onorientationchange = function   {}  function load_content   {      var url = document.location.toString  ;      if  url.match  about i   {          $ "content" .load ' api about.php' ;      }      if  url.match  index i   {          $ "content" .load ' api categories.php' ;      }         .. do for remainder of pages  }       will use this for all load events  $  .ready function  {      load_content  ;  } ;   So far we have placeholders for onHashChange and onOrientationChange as well as some preliminary   loading content steps based on the URL. We can load the contents of each .html page with the  associated API data page  about.php . The page  api about.php will just provide plain HTML derived  from the site’s Content Management System.   Chapter Summary   In this chapter we talked about how to create an API and some basics of JavaScript such as Ajax and  DOM manipulation. Some of the items  including the XMLHttpRequest object or  document.querySelector  you might never use because you’ll be using a JavaScript framework such as  jQuery.   Nevertheless, if you find yourself debugging a framework, or wanting to just experiment, I thought it   would be nice to show you what’s underneath the covers of a powerful framework such as jQuery  because nothing is worse than being dependent on something about which you know little.   Before moving on to the next chapter you should know how to:   83    CHAPTER 4    JAVASCRIPT AND APIS      Create and structure your data API.     Have an idea for what kind of data your API will use: HTML, XML, Plain Text,   JSON, or a combination.      Know how to retrieve these data via AJAX using either XMLHttpRequest or jQuery.     Know how to display these data on your page via DOM manipulation either   manually or via jQuery.      Know where to find some useful information on events, debugging, and dialogs.   But still we don’t have styling or any cool effects and it might take a long time to code them, so   although jQuery is great and saves us a lot of time there’s still a piece missing. This is why we need to talk  about mobile frameworks next.         84    C H A P T E R  5               Mobile Frameworks   Mobile frameworks put together three things.      Common JavaScript APIs and libraries     CSS and themes  natively styled       Effects    So although we did all this work by ourselves in the previous chapters, now we have a mobile   framework that will do most of the work for us. In this chapter I talk about jQuery Mobile. There are  other Mobile Web Frameworks out there such as iUI, Sencha Touch, jQTouch, and iWebKit to name a  few. They all do basically the same thing: give you a CSS and JS framework for making your mobile web  apps look and feel like a native app. Or in some cases provide you the ability to convert your web app to  a native app via a framework such as Phonegap  which I talk about in Chapter 15 .   Although we’re focused on iPhone and iPad apps it’s worth noting that jQuery Mobile supports   Blackberry, Android, Palm, and Windows phones. So should you want to expand your mobile footprint  you won’t need to do much and if you already know jQuery the learning curve is rather small. By the end  of the chapter we’ll be ready to code the home page of our sample web app, Grandview Avenue.   Companion Site Reference   Example 5-1: Follow this link to see an alternative mobile framework in action  iUI .    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter5 iui index.html   Overview of jQuery Mobile   To get a basic jQuery mobile page you will need three things:   Latest copy of jQuery –  http:  jquery.com               Latest copy of jQuery Mobile CSS   Latest copy of jQuery Mobile JS   85    CHAPTER 5    MOBILE FRAMEWORKS        Note  At the time of writing this book the current version of jQuery Mobile is 1.0 beta3.   To use jQuery Mobile on your page, the   of your document should look like the code below.   Companion Site Reference   Example 5-2: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter5 jquerymobile index.html        JQuery Mobile                           Note  You will need to add location prefixes to the href and src attributes, depending on your directory  structure. The example assumes that everything is in the same directory.   In the next sections I talk about the details of jQuery mobile. You can find out more from   http:  jquerymobile.com.    Working with Pages   The first thing to discuss is some of the conventions associated with the page structure. These are the  rules that allow the framework to do things as intended. These rules consist of CSS class names, element  IDs, and structural conventions. So although you might think you can just name some stuff according to  the class names or ID names, if you’re missing the structure, things won’t work.   This is because this mobile framework  actually all mobile frameworks  in order to be efficient uses  nested CSS selectors for layout and CSS element selectors in the JS logic to do certain things. If you don’t  follow a convention rule the framework might not work and therefore your page won’t work.     Note  Convention over Configuration is a design paradigm that allows programmers to stick to a set of rules  rather than making decisions about how their code needs to be configured. jQuery Mobile, like many of today’s  frameworks, uses this design approach.   86    CHAPTER 5    MOBILE FRAMEWORKS                         I  suggest that if you want to modify the convention, that’s fine; just use the convention first, then   tweak and test as you go rather than creating something you want and trying to do it the other way around.   Page Data-Role  The first meta-element attribute you’ll use is data-role. This tells the framework that the contents of the  element should be a page.   What’s a Page?  The term page can be used in these ways:   A file associated with some HTML such as about.html or about.php or a view  generated by a framework like  about.   It can be a screen the user sees.   In most mobile frameworks you have what’s called a multiple-page template. These templates allow   your mobile application’s HTML, PHP, or other files to serve multiple screens as viewed from the  perspective of the user, all being contained within a master page and rendered via Ajax. This gives you  the ability to have nice transitions between user-viewed pages, rather than the refreshes you typically  experience on normal web sites.   More Data-Roles  From within the data-role="page", you have three other data roles.   Data-role="header" – This is the section of the document used as the page header.   Data-role="content" – This is the section of the document used as the page  content area.   Data-role="footer" – This is the section of the document used as the page footer.     Note  These do not correspond to the associated new elements such as  ,  , and   in  HTML5. Rather these are element-level attributes and can be interchanged with the   tags specified on the  demo web site.   When you put these together you end up with the sample page shown in Figure 5-1.   87    CHAPTER 5    MOBILE FRAMEWORKS      Figure 5-1. Sample page      So just as before, this page is rather simple and plain; the markup for this page is as follows.   Companion Site Reference   Example 5-3: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter5 jquerymobile headers.html                        JQuery Mobile    88    CHAPTER 5    MOBILE FRAMEWORKS   Multipage Templates  This is a single page with multiple sections where content is shown. In reality it’s just a hidden element  that gets unhidden and moved around via a CSS transition, but to the user it looks like a new page or  screen.                                                    Page Title                  Page content goes here.                  Page Footer                  Companion Site Reference   Example 5-4: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter5 jquerymobile twopage.html                Page Title                  Page 1         To Page 2                   Page Footer                        Page Title         89    CHAPTER 5    MOBILE FRAMEWORKS                Page 2         To Page 1                   Page Footer            You can see that moving between pages or screens all within the same file is rather easy. By default,  your pages will all have the same  . To avoid this, use an element called data-title, as shown in  the example above.    Linking to Other Pages Files  Normally you would just need to set your page file name in the href attribute of your   tag. But in  jQuery mobile this behavior is overridden or Hijaxed and converted to an Ajax request. So <a  href="newpage.html"> actually makes an Ajax call to retrieve the page, and then it’s loaded into the DOM.   To disable this behavior you can add one of these two attributes to your element:   Rel="external"   or   data-ajax="false"   multipage template.   You would want to use this if you’re linking to a page with multiple internal pages such as a   Moving Back  To move back to a previous page you just need to create a link with the attribute data-rel="back".   We talk more about the back button later when we discuss buttons.   Page Transitions  Unlike traditional page transitions, where your page jumps to a new set of contents, with jQuery Mobile  you have six different page transitions or effects. These are created via the element attribute called data- transition.                      Slide  default  – Causes the new page to slide in from the left   Slideup – Causes new pages to slide in from the top   Slidedown – Causes new pages to slide in from the bottom   Pop – Causes new pages to pop in   Fade – Causes new pages to fade in   Flip – Causes new pages to flip in   You can also change the direction of the page transition by adding the attribute data-  direction="reverse".   90       CHAPTER 5    MOBILE FRAMEWORKS   Dialogs  Sometimes you don’t want to take the user to a new page. You want the context and focus of the user to  be on the current page, but you need to display new information relevant to a user action. For these you  use dialogs.    To use a dialog instead of a page just add the element data-rel="dialog" to your   tag. The same   transitions apply to how the dialog will appear as they do for page transitions.   To close the dialog just use the same data-rel="back" attribute we used for back button links. Again,   we talk about using a nicer close button when we talk about buttons.   Scripting Pages  jQuery Mobile has the following mechanism for prefetching pages.   $.mobile.loadPage pageurl ;     Note  Be careful when continuously appending and adding to the page DOM. This has to do with the memory of  your iOS device and the more pages loaded into memory the slower your mobile app will run.   changeHash – A Boolean to whether you’d like the URL’s hash to be updated on  success   A simple example of an anchor calling JavaScript with a transition either in HTML or called from   For changing pages, use    $.mobile.changePage to, transition, back, changeHash     The arguments are defined as   to – The page to which you want to change   transition – The transition effect you would like   back – A Boolean where true is forward and false is back                JavaScript.    About   - or    About   ...  function toAbout   {    $.mobile.changePage  "about.html", { transition: "pop"}  ;  }   Toolbars and Buttons   Toolbars are used usually in headers and footers of your application. There’s more detail on footer and  navbars in the next chapter but for now we can talk about the basics and how to configure the header.   91    CHAPTER 5    MOBILE FRAMEWORKS      Header Toolbars  The default header is created by the following markup.         Page Title       icon="back", data-rel="back".   To add a few buttons to the header we just use the following convention with three attributes: data-              Back            Header            Save       This gives you a button called “Save” and a functioning “Back Button” for your mobile app.   Figure 5-2. Header bar with buttons      92       CHAPTER 5    MOBILE FRAMEWORKS   Creating Buttons  From the previous example you saw that making a back button and a save button was nothing more  than using the data-icon attribute. See Figure 5-2.   To make a normal   tag a button, use the data-role attribute.   Companion Site Reference   Example 5-5: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter5 jquerymobile buttons.html    button text    Or use normal form elements.    button             Button Icons  Button icons are all derived from an image in the jQuery Mobile download and have names such as  arrow-r, gear, grid, star, and the like. You can review all of these from the jQuery Mobile site.   You can position the icon via the attribute: data-iconpos="righttopbottomnotext". If you don’t   want text on the button you just need to specify notext instead of a position.   If you want your button to be compact just use the data-inline="true" attribute.  If you want to group your buttons, wrap all your buttons in an element with the attribute: data-  role="controlgroup".   You can view a few examples of these attributes in Figure 5-3.   93    CHAPTER 5    MOBILE FRAMEWORKS      Figure 5-3. Button examples      The full code for Figure 5-3 is shown below.          Normal        Compact                  A            B            C                List Views  All lists on jQuery Mobile take the form of the   and   tags with the attribute data-role="listview"  for the   tag.    94       CHAPTER 5    MOBILE FRAMEWORKS   There are several ways to create lists with jQuery Mobile. In some of the examples shown in Figure   5-4 you can include: Basic List, List with Counts, and List with Thumbnails. You need to decide which list  is best for you and it all depends on how much information you want or need to show.   In the mobile app in the Putting It All Together section I use all three list types, but not all of them in   the same context. Be consistent but also try to remain flexible as you design your pages.

A Short Note on Themes  One thing I’ve not mentioned yet are the different themes offered with jQuery Mobile. There are five  themes:                  Theme A  default  – Black and dark grey background and white text    Theme C – Light gray background with black text   Theme E – Yellow background with black text   Theme D – White background with black text   Theme B – Blue background and white text   To use any of these themes just apply the data-theme attribute to pages, toolbars, content, buttons,   and list as in:       96       CHAPTER 5    MOBILE FRAMEWORKS     Note  Soon jQuery Mobile will have a custom theme roller similar to jQuery UI that will allow you to create your  own themes and use them on your mobile site.   Putting It All Together   Now that we have our mobile framework we’re ready to create the home page of GrandviewAve.com  mobile edition.   First we’ll need to add our jQuery mobile JS and CSS files to the header.           Welcome To Grandview Ave.                                         Next we need to load the content from the API for the business categories.               $  .ready function  {          $.mobile.pageLoading  ;          $.get 'api cats.php', function data  {              $ 'cats' .html data ;              $ 'cats ul' .listview  ;              $.mobile.pageLoading true ;          } ;          preload  ;      } ;      function preload   {  <?php  for  $i=0;$i<7;$i++  {  ?>          $.get 'api profiles.php?id= ', function data  {              $ 'list_ ' .html data ;              $ 'cat_ ' .page  ;          } ;      }         Note that I used a little PHP in this file. I did this to build the loop of preloaded profile list   dynamically into the DOM. I could have hard-coded it but my file would be rather large.  Next we create the first mobile “page”. This will be the home page as seen by users.                                     97    CHAPTER 5    MOBILE FRAMEWORKS                                  Finally we create the subsequent pages, again using a little PHP:   <?  for  $i=0;$i<7;$i++  {  ?>   ">                Back                                                      ">                 The API side of this call looks like this:       Business Directory     All         id?>"> name?>           You might notice that we’re not using JSON at this time because that makes the page a little more   complicated and the data set is not that large.   This takes you to a more detailed list of businesses.   Figure 5-5 shows a simple home page made by creating and decorating a list of business categories.   98    CHAPTER 5    MOBILE FRAMEWORKS   99   Figure 5-5. Grandview Ave home page   This is followed by the next page with a smaller logo, back button, and a list with icons  Figure 5-6 .    CHAPTER 5    MOBILE FRAMEWORKS      Figure 5-6. Next page of detailed listings      The site is already taking shape. But notice that although we are using the mobile framework for   controlling our pages and getting the information dynamically, there are still some things that are missing.   Fixed tabbed navigation to navigate between all the pages of the site            No mention of design for the iPad   Touch events such as scrolling and swiping   This chapter talked about using the jQuery Mobile framework rather than creating all the CSS and JS  yourself. We used some of concepts from the previous chapters but due to the conventions and the out- of-the-box functionality we didn’t need to do much.   Before moving on to the next chapter you should know how to:   Summary   100    CHAPTER 5    MOBILE FRAMEWORKS         Create a basic jQuery mobile page.     Create a multipage template.        Create headers and buttons with various themes.   Add dynamic content to your pages via AJAX.   These items above give us a great start to completing our mobile web application, however, there  are still a few pieces missing, mainly revolving around navigation, touch interactions, and how to take  advantage of the extra screen real estate with the iPad. That’s what I talk about next.   101    C H A P T E R  6               Usability, Navigation, and Touch   This is the chapter where I focus on how your user will interact with your mobile site. It’s the glue that  holds everything else together. Because you’re designing for a mobile site and not a native app, you  need to keep in mind the usage paradigm for your users has been affected not by websites, but by  native apps. So this means they’ll want to interact with your mobile site in the same way they do with  their favorite apps.   Another thing you need to decide is whether you want to be orientation sensitive. You need to ask   the question: does your navigation change based on whether you’re in landscape or portrait mode?   Of course this begs a larger question. How do users interact with your mobile site? Or what do you  want the user experience  UX  to be like for your site? How do you want users to navigate, or use touch  interaction?   I talk about a little of everything starting with user experience or usability.   Usability   What’s usability? Basically it’s the ease of use and learnability of a system, in our case a mobile website  built with HTML5 and JavaScript. Much has been done to enhance user experience in the past five years  with technologies such as Ajax, user-centered design, and page-as-an application metaphors. In fact I  would say user experience is probably the best it’s ever been, but that translates differently to the iPhone  and iPad because you have the following additional constraints.   Small screen size   Smaller memory   Slower performance   Slower download   Awkward input                       Sometimes constraints are good because they cause you to focus on the essentials; other times they   make things downright difficult to work. Here are some tips to help you out.   Small Form Factor Tips  The following are some things to think about when programming for 320 pixels versus 1,024 or larger.   Limit Content to the Essential: Because you can focus your target users on exactly  what they need.   103    CHAPTER 6    USABILITY, NAVIGATION, AND TOUCH                                     Limit Navigation Areas: Because you might have less content to navigate to and  from, creating a small flat navigation will allow users to get to the content on your  site fast.   Limit the Physical Size of Content: Because using large images or lots of text  requiring scrolling will make your user’s fingers get tired.   Performance Tips  The following are some things to think about when your user has a slower network connection and  slower processor.      Minify your CSS and JS: Because this will allow your site to download faster and   appear as snappy as a native app. See Chapter 3  mod_deflate .      Optimize away from frameworks or plugins: Because as your app gets more   sophisticated lightening up the script and HTML footprint of your site app has a  surprising effect on performance.   Prefetch and cache content locally: Because this will allow your site to download  everything on first load as opposed to loading it as you go.   Input Tips  Here are some things to think about when users don’t have a keyboard.   Limit forms and text searches because keyboards are a little awkward on touch  devices; having large forms or requiring search is probably not a good thing.      Use custom form widgets from HTML5.     Use custom buttons from jQuery Mobile.      Try to use swipe or other touch gestures for navigation versus having users hunt  for navigation.   Other Tips  Finally, the following are just a few other usability tips you might try as you develop your site.   If you use Ajax or jQuery Mobile to load your pages, make sure to use a loading  image to show that the system is working.   Try to use common places in the header or footer for things such as settings or  home icons.      Don’t try to reinvent the mobile paradigm. Users are accustomed to using mobile  apps in a certain way; if they have to think, then you’re going to make your site less  usable.   Link your images.   Put your app in front of your parents or kids and then ask them to use it without  giving them any instructions.   104    CHAPTER 6    USABILITY, NAVIGATION, AND TOUCH      Site Navigation   A natural byproduct of making your mobile site usable is to make it easy to navigate. So for that I’ll now  talk about some common navigation design patterns.           Tree Drill Down: This is where you take a large collection of data, classify it, and  refine what you’re looking for as you drill down, usually in the form of a list.      Header Menus: This is where you provide tabs, buttons, or tools in the header to   assist in navigation.   Footers and Tab Bars: This is where you provide tabs for your user to move  horizontally across your site rather than having to use the back button to move  back to the home page in order to drill back down to another area of the site.      Overlays and Modals: This is where instead of navigating to a page you just   provide an overlay of information. This is useful when you don’t want the user to  lose context but the information is not sufficient for an entire page.   All of these types of navigation are supported by jQuery Mobile. Let’s look at them in more detail.   Tree Drill-Down and Headers  This kind of navigation works best if you are filtering through information that’s naturally organized and  grouped. To use this kind of navigation, just create a list view and link it.   In Figure 6-1, the right image has a back button which is in the header providing easy navigation to   the previous page.   Companion Site Reference   Examples 6-1 and 6-2: Follow the links below to run these examples on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter6 drill1.php  http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter6 drill2.php   105    CHAPTER 6    USABILITY, NAVIGATION, AND TOUCH      Figure 6-1. Tree Drill-Down   The source code for this example is insanely easy:            Link 1          Link 2           106    CHAPTER 6    USABILITY, NAVIGATION, AND TOUCH      And for the second page, I just added a back button:       Back    Drill Page 2          Drill Down List            More 1          More 2           Tabbed Navigation  You can add tabs to your site in a few ways. Top tabs can be designed very similarly to traditional web  navigation with a top navigation.   Bottom navigation can be a little more complicated in that sometimes you might want to fix the   navigation at the bottom so it looks like a native tab bar. Fortunately with iOS5, you can specify a scroll  size and fix your navigation as opposed to having to do JavaScript to move your navigation as you scroll,  although I’ve not shown that in this chapter.   This kind of navigation works best if you have a limited number of areas you want to take your user,   usually five or less, where you can then apply other navigation styles from within a tab.   In Figure 6-2, I’ve created a two-tab footer navigation. Note the styles and that the buttons are   evenly spaced. This is done automatically by jQuery Mobile, saving you from having to space them or  alternate CSS based on orientation changes.   jQuery also provides image icons for these images to make them appear very close to the iOS tab bar   design pattern.

Tab bar from Native iOS App      Again the code for this is really easy with jQuery Mobile. I just added the following attributes to the   footer, data-role, data-position="fixed", then created another data-role called navbar with some  more list.   The colors and states are maintained through convention via the class names ui-btn-active and   ui-state-persist.                 <a href="drill1.html" class="ui-btn-active ui-state-persist" cid:1       data-transition="fade">one          two              108       CHAPTER 6    USABILITY, NAVIGATION, AND TOUCH   Dialogs and Modals  With jQuery Mobile creating a dialog is as simple as adding the attribute data-rel="dialog" to your    or  . Then when you click the  X  of the dialog you will be taken back to your original page.   Companion Site Reference   Example 6-4: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter6 modals.php   I have some simple content in the screenshot shown in Figure 6-3.   Figure 6-3. Sample Dialog Window      109    CHAPTER 6    USABILITY, NAVIGATION, AND TOUCH   Simple content is the best for dialogs as you don’t want them to be larger than two-thirds of the   screen. Although the example above is plain, usually it’s overlaying a page of information or providing  other functionality to support the underlying page.   Navigating for the iPad   I wanted to talk a little bit about how you would use your current framework with the iPad. In general  you have three options:      Option 1. Modify your current site to be iPad-compatible. This can be little or no   work, but if your site is optimized for a mouse it might not work that well for touch  interaction.      Option 2. Modify your mobile navigation for the iPad. This should work out of the   box, but it will look strange on a larger surface.      Option 3. Create a completely new site just for the iPad. You can have a lot of   additional work and some mobile frameworks are not optimized for tablet  interfaces.   In the example below I’ve hacked together a little jQuery Mobile, and although it works, it’s not as  nice an experience as the native site. Good thing I talked about how to roll your own CSS and JS in the  previous chapters because Option 3 will require you do just that.   Figure 6-4. Sample iPad Navigation using jQuery Mobile   110    CHAPTER 6    USABILITY, NAVIGATION, AND TOUCH      iPad Tips                   jQuery Mobile does not work too well with iPad, so although this mobile  framework works great for your iPod Touch or iPhone, you will find it lacking in  several areas for the iPad.   You have some more area, so your content will need to scale to this area. One way  is to use the navigation metaphor pictured in Figure 6-4 and combine the  landscape mode of your iPhone project for body content on the right.   You can make better use of the toolbar not only because it’s longer but because  you can have more icons and even a menu on the right to drop down and provide  context.      On an OrientationChange event, hide the navigation so that your body content   remains roughly the same size.   You might have better performance on the iPad because most usage will be  without 3G and over WiFi. So think about where users will be using their iPad  when considering performance and content size.   Working with a Larger Body Area  With the iPad you have roughly 65% of 1,024 pixels or just over 650 px of body area. This content size  might roughly equate to the same area you’re using on your normal website.     So rather than starting from your mobile content, I’d suggest that you just use what content you   have on your main site. You can then adapt the content by adding some iPad navigation features.   Creating a Header  The header was very similar to the iPhone version as you can see below.           Home                           <img src=" m images logo.png" alt="welcome to cid:1    grandviewave.com" border="0">                      Creating a Left Nav  The very first thing I did was create a container and float it to the left. Next I changed the navigation a  little so that it was continued by jQuery Mobile and such that I changed the theme to the selected page  to a different theme so that it stood out.     Note  The PHP in the page does nothing more than check for the name of the page so that it can modify the  style. There are many ways to do this but I thought I’d just show you something rather simple and easy to follow.   111    CHAPTER 6    USABILITY, NAVIGATION, AND TOUCH                           Grandview Ave for the iPad             >           <a href="directory.php" data-transition="fade" class= cid:1   "ui-state-persist">Business Directory              >           <a href="sales.php" data-transition="fade" class= cid:1   "ui-state-persist">Sales &amp; Specials              >           <a href="parking.php" data-transition="fade" class= cid:1   "ui-state-persist">Parking              >           <a href="audvid.php" data-transition="fade" class= cid:1   "ui-state-persist">Audio &amp; Video              >           <a href="about.php" data-transition="fade" class= cid:1   "ui-state-persist">About The Avenue              >           <a href="contact.php" data-transition="fade" class= cid:1   "ui-state-persist">Contact               Visit Normal Site               For the right part  or body  of the page I again just wrapped it in a   and floated it right.           Some Title       Creating a Footer  Again, as with the header I was able to create a footer in much the same way as I did with the iPhone.           &copy;2010-2012 CodeGin LLC.       Touch Interactions   So although the constraints presented earlier make programming your site a little more difficult there’s  something you get with iOS devices you don’t readily get from the computer, and that’s touch  interactions. Touch interactions, if done correctly, can really improve the usability of your site.   One-Finger Events  These events just require a single finger and can be used to tap  vs. click , swipe left or right, or scroll up  or down.      Tap: Just like a single click.   112    CHAPTER 6    USABILITY, NAVIGATION, AND TOUCH                                           Double Tap: Just a like a double click.      Swipe  Left, Right, Up, Down : Tap then drag your finger in a certain direction.   Multitouch Events  These events happen when two or more fingers are used to interact with the surface of your iPhone or  iPad.   Pinch: Usually to zoom out in the case of a larger website or Google map   Spread: Usually to zoom in in the case of a nonviewport website or Google map   Rotate: To rotate an object clockwise or counterclockwise   Supported Events by Mobile Safari   TouchStart: Happens every time a finger is placed on the surface.   TouchEnd: Happens every time a finger is removed from the surface.   TouchMove: Happens when a finger is on a surface and is moved.   TouchCancel: Not really a practical event, but this is when the system cancels the  tracking for a touch.   GestureStart: When two or more fingers touch the surface.   GestureEnd: When the gesture ends or just one or no more fingers are touching the  surface.   GestureChange: When both fingers move while touching the surface.   An example of coding your own swipe left or swipe right gesture events would look something like   this.

But you don’t need to work this out yourself: jQuery  Mobile has it built in.   jQuery Mobile Events  Underneath the covers of jQuery Mobile these events encapsulate touch- and click-related events.                          Tap: After a complete touch event.   Taphold: Touching the screen for about a second.   Swipe: Triggers when there’s a drag of more than 30 px within a one-second  duration.   Swipeleft: Triggers when a swipe is done in the left direction.   Swiperight: Triggers when a swipe is done in the right direction.   ScrollStart: Triggers when an item is scrolled up or down.   ScrollStop: Triggers when the scroll stops.   Below I show you how to execute the gestures via some JavaScript. The swipe event will always fire   in the case of swipeleft and swiperight.   The tap event will also be fired if you just touch the screen and will always fire before the taphold   event. So comment out the ones you don’t want to use.   114       CHAPTER 6    USABILITY, NAVIGATION, AND TOUCH   Companion Site Reference   Example 6-6: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter6 events2.php              $ 'body' .live 'swipe', function e  {              alert 'You swiped!' ;              e.stopImmediatePropagation  ;              return false;          } ;          $ 'body' .live 'swipeleft', function e  {              alert 'You swiped left!' ;              e.stopImmediatePropagation  ;              return false;          } ;          $ 'body' .live 'swiperight', function e  {              alert 'You swiped right!' ;              e.stopImmediatePropagation  ;              return false;          } ;          $ 'body' .live 'tap', function e  {              alert 'You tapped!' ;              e.stopImmediatePropagation  ;              return false;          } ;          $ 'body' .live 'taphold', function e  {              alert 'You are touching the screen!' ;              e.stopImmediatePropagation  ;              return false;          } ;        Putting It All Together   So far for GrandviewAve we’ve just built a basic directory structure. Now it’s time to link these files  together into a cohesive navigation. I use a combination of navigation metaphors for the site: drill-down,  a tab bar footer, and a header with some buttons.   The drill-down allows users to navigate the business directory by category and the tabbed footer   allows users to move to different parts of the site without having to go back home.   I didn’t know quite how I wanted to do it, so let me show you some of the options I created during   the design.   115    CHAPTER 6    USABILITY, NAVIGATION, AND TOUCH      Option 1  The first option I thought about was a plain list  Figure 6-5 . This did everything I needed it to do: display  a list of the navigational areas and allow users to drill down to everything all the way to the individual  business.    But this didn’t quite have the kind of usability I wanted because every time I would need to look for   parking or find out sales and specials I’d have to go back or click the top logo.   Figure 6-5. Nav Drill Down  Option 1       Option 2  The second option  Figure 6-6  was a bit closer mainly because of the footer navigation. This navigation  allowed me to jump between businesses and parking.    But like Option 1 it was still a little plain.   116       CHAPTER 6    USABILITY, NAVIGATION, AND TOUCH   Figure 6-6. Footer Tabbed Navigation  Option 2       Option 3  With Option 2 I had all the navigation elements I wanted users to access in the footer, except for the  directory. So I just added the business directory to the home page via a single link and the rest of the  application could now be accessed via the footer.   117    CHAPTER 6    USABILITY, NAVIGATION, AND TOUCH      Figure 6-7. Combined Footer & Drill-down  Final    In Figure 6-7 the left screen is the home page, the middle one is the business directory drill-down,   followed by a business detail page, in this case Iannarino Dexter Creative.   To explain the code for each let’s start with the header. There are two: one for the home page and   the second with the back button and home icon. The class names header1 and header2 just define some  of the parameters such as the background and size of the logo. You can ignore them as they contain no  conventional aspects.      Header 1—Home Page  This is just a plain vanilla header with the attribute data-role=”header”.          <img src="images logo.png" alt="welcome to cid:1    grandviewave.com" border="0">          Header 2—Subsequent Pages  This is slightly different because we have two buttons: one the back button specified by an   tag with  data-add-back-btn, data-rel, and data-icon attributes, and the second with another   tag for the  home icon with the data-iconpos="notext" attribute specifying no text.   118    CHAPTER 6    USABILITY, NAVIGATION, AND TOUCH                  Back       <img src="images logo.png" alt="welcome to cid:1    grandviewave.com" border="0">       Home       The combination of these two headers is used in the entire mobile site and swapped out   dynamically on the pages via some crude PHP:     .   Footer Navigation  The second part of the navigation is what’s in the footer. First it’s sticky to the bottom of the page via the  two attributes data-role="footer" and data-position="fixed".   The colors are added via the class names: ui-btn-activeui-state-persist, and the fade transition is   created via the attribute: data-transition="fade".   I chose the fade transition because it seemed to look a little better on my iPhone than the “slide”  transition that’s there by default. I seemed to get a shrinking flash effect that just seemed a little odd.              <a href=" m index.php" class="ui-btn-active ui-state-persist" cid:1   data-transition="fade">Home     <a href=" m near.php" class=" ui-state-persist" cid:1   data-transition="fade">Near Me     <a href=" m sales.php" class=" ui-state-persist" cid:1   data-transition="fade">Sales     <a href=" m parking.php" class=" ui-state-persist" cid:1   data-transition="fade">Parking     <a href=" m more.php" class=" ui-state-persist" cid:1   data-transition="fade">More     So far I’ve not had the need for any touch effects so I’m not going to add any of those at this time.

GPS gives you as the developer a lot of power to connect the real world to a web site or  mobile app that provides a connection to your user that is far more intimate than technologies such as  user preferences or personalization.   To make things even better, what if you had the entire world that could be viewed through either   road maps or satellite photos and everything could be interfaced via JavaScript? Hey, we have something  for that, and it’s called Google Maps.   The one thing about having both of these at your disposal is you can add incredibly powerful   functionality with very little code.   Getting GPS Coordinates   GPS coordinates are measured with longitude and latitude.   Longitude: The vertical lines on the globe. The longitude of 0.0 is the Prime Meridian  and runs through Greenwich, England. Changes in longitude often correspond to  time zone changes. When you move east, the longitude goes +, or east, and if you go  west of Greenwich, longitude goes –, or west. For example, Columbus, Ohio, would  be -83  or 83 west , and Seattle, Washington, would be -122  or 122 west .    A degree of longitude is approximately 69 miles at the equator, but gradually goes  to zero as you move closer to a pole. So, if you’re on the equator and drive 69 miles  east, you’ll be at longitude 1 degree east.   Latitude: The horizontal lines on the globe. The latitude of 0.0 degrees is the  equator. Changes in latitude would be how far north or how far south of the  equator you move, where 90 is the North Pole and -90 is the South Pole. The  latitude of 39 would be Columbus, Ohio  or 39 north .    A degree of latitude is approximately 69 miles. So, once again, if you’re at the  equator and drive 69 miles north, your latitude would be 1 degree north.  Furthermore, a minute, or 1 60th of a degree, is approximately 1.15 miles, and a  second of latitude is 1 3600th of a degree or just over 100 feet.    The GPS function that’s built into iOS is the navigator.geolocation object. There are two methods   for getting the GPS:   getCurrentPosition: This will get the GPS position once.   watchCurrentPosition: This will get the GPS position on a timed interval.                          121    CHAPTER 7    GPS AND GOOGLE MAPS      Companion Site Reference   Example 7-1: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter7 basics.php.   Both of these methods take as parameters a success function, an error function, and options in the  form of JSON syntax. In the following example, I just create a button that calls the getGPS function that  invokes the navigator.geolocation.getPosition method  see Figure 7-1 .     Note  The enableHighAccuracy option provides you with the highest accuracy. However, this option as well as  watchCurrentPosition will consume a lot of battery life because GPS is a high-power activity.      function getGPS  {      navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition successGPS, errorGPS, cid:1    {enableHighAccuracy : true} ;  }  function successGPS position  {      var lat = position.coords.latitude;      var lon = position.coords.longitude;      var curHTML = $ 'gps_coords' .html   + "lat="+lat + ",lon="+lon+" ";       $ 'gps_coords' .html curHTML ;  }    function errorGPS   {       alert 'GPS Error' ;  }      Get GPS Coordinates    GPS Coords Below        122       CHAPTER 7    GPS AND GOOGLE MAPS   Figure 7-1. Simple GPS app      If you want to poll the GPS coordinates or get continuous feedback, you can use the watchPosition   method. This returns the GPS coordinates to your callback function approximately once per second.   var updateLocation;    function watchGPS   {    updateLocation = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition       successGPS, errorGPS,{enableHighAccuracy : true} ;  }    function clearWatch   {    navigator.geolocation.clearWatch updateLocation ;  }   123    CHAPTER 7    GPS AND GOOGLE MAPS      Using Google Maps   The Google Maps API gives you the ability to interact with road and satellite maps accessible via Google  and use Google Maps on your mobile site; all you need are a few lines of code.   A Simple Map Example  In this simple example, we reference the Google Maps JavaScript file from Google and then create an  initialize   function. This function name is just arbitrary; it can be anything you want. It either can be  initialized via body.onload or via jQuery in $  .ready or can be initialized manually via some button click  or other kind of event.    The first thing you do is create a LatLng object with a latitude and longitude in the constructor   followed by some options, specifically:             zoom: This is the zoom scale of the map you are displaying.   center: This is a LatLng object that centers your map.   mapTypeId: This is whether you are displaying a ROADMAP, HYBRID, SATELLITE, or  TERRAIN.   Finally, you just create a Map object, assigned to a variable for reference, with a constructor of an   element from which it needs to reside. Based on the width and height of this element, the Google map  will autosize and center.

CHAPTER 7    GPS AND GOOGLE MAPS   Figure 7-2. Simple Google Maps usage      Geocoding and Markers  Sometimes you don’t have a longitude and latitude, so what do you do? Well, here’s where something  called geocoding comes into play. Geocoding is the process of finding a longitude and latitude via such  data as street address and ZIP or postal codes.   The Google Geocoder class takes a GeocoderRequest object  JSON Address object  and returns a   LatLng object.   To use this instead of the LatLng variable, just create the GeoCoder object, pass in a valid   GeocoderRequest, and pass the resultant LatLng object to the initialize function.   It is also helpful to show the LatLng you’re centering on. You do that with Google Maps via a Marker.   The Marker object takes as part of its constructor MarkerOptions  more JSON , and in the following   example I’ve added two properties:       position: The LatLng coordinate of the marker   125    CHAPTER 7    GPS AND GOOGLE MAPS          map: The Map object you’re applying the marker   The following example shows you how to use both geocoding and a marker with a basic Google   map.

Simple geocoding example      Static Maps  Sometimes you just need a picture of a map and might want to place markers on it. You can do this with  Google Maps API v3, but you will have a lot of JavaScript, and it’s performance-intensive for a phone,  even if it’s a dual- or quad-core iOS device.   For this Google has given you the ability to create a map via a URL that you can place as an image   source.

Simple static maps example      Interacting with Google Maps via GPS  So, you’ve been able to get GPS coordinates from your phone, and you’ve been able to create a few basic  Google maps, but how do you connect the two?   First, you will be moving on a map, so you’ll need a way to update your position on a map. Next, you   will want to identify where you want to go. To designate those two places, use two markers.   The first marker will be a blue dot that will represent your current location. For the second marker   you’ll just use a standard red pin. For the blue dot, I’ve used a custom MarkerImage  blue_dot.png file . In  Chapter 8, I’ll use pure CSS.   After you create the markers, create the initialize function to take the coordinates of your position    a LatLng object  and place that marker created earlier to the position on your Google map.   When the page loads  implemented by JQuery $.ready , you can call watchPosition, which invokes  the successGPS function. The successGPS function in turn creates a new marker with this location, which  will show you your current location relative to your goal location  the red pin marker . If this occurs each  second, you’ll get a lot of markers if you don’t reuse the variable name.    129    CHAPTER 7    GPS AND GOOGLE MAPS   Companion Site Reference   Example 7-5: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    www.learnhtml5book.com chapter7 currentlocation.php.   <script type="text javascript" src="http:  maps.googleapis.com maps  cid:1  api js?sensor=false">       Current Location           var map;      var bluedot = new google.maps.MarkerImage 'blue_dot.png',              new google.maps.Size 38, 38 ,              new google.maps.Point 0, 0 ,              new google.maps.Point 19, 19                ;       function initialize location  {          var myOptions = {              zoom: 17,              center: location,              mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP          }           map = new google.maps.Map document.getElementById "basic_map" , myOptions ;           var marker = new google.maps.Marker {              position: location,              map: map,  } ;      }      $  .ready function   {          var geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder  ;          geocoder.geocode { 'address': '1373 grandview ave. columbus ohio 43212'}, cid:1    function results, status  {              initialize results[0].geometry.location ;          } ;          updateLocation = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition successGPS, errorGPS, cid:1    {enableHighAccuracy : true} ;      } ;      function successGPS position  {          var latlng = new google.maps.LatLng position.coords.latitude, cid:1    position.coords.longitude ;          var myLocation = new google.maps.Marker {              position: latlng,              map: map,   130    CHAPTER 7    GPS AND GOOGLE MAPS                  icon: bluedot,              title:"Me"          } ;      }      function errorGPS   {          alert 'GPS Error' ;      }              When I run this example in my own location, I get the screen shown in Figure 7-5. However, if you   use this code example directly, your goal will be a long way from your current position  unless you  happen to be near Grandview Avenue! , so update the geocoder to a location near you to try this for  yourself.   Figure 7-5. Combining Google  GPS       131    CHAPTER 7    GPS AND GOOGLE MAPS      Now you’ve combined everything with one simple example, including using geolocation, using   geocoding, and putting two markers on a dynamic Google map. Now let’s apply it to the example web  app, Grandview Avenue.   Putting It All Together   So far, for our mobile Grandview Ave site we’ve started putting things together. We have navigation, we  have a business directory, but we don’t have features like near-me, parking, or the actual location of a  business on the avenue. Now we are ready to do that.   Parking  Grandview Avenue has very few parking spaces for the number of businesses, and all the off-street  parking might be difficult to find for new visitors to the area. So, one of the things I wanted on the site  was to show people the different places to park. I visited the six largest off-street parking spots near the  avenue and tagged their GPS locations with my iPhone.   For this I had two options. Option 1 was to just show a static map. It was easy and fast  since it was   only an image being served from Google , and it would also keep things simple.   Option 1: Static Map  Let’s create a static map by constructing a URL with six markers, all representing parking locations. Let’s  keep it simple by reusing objects we already know, LatLng, and just using those objects to create a string.   function loadParking   {    var p1 = new google.maps.LatLng 39.98376667, -83.04541944 ;  var p2 = new google.maps.LatLng 39.98540278, -83.04531944 ;  var p3 = new google.maps.LatLng 39.98600278, -83.04510000 ;  var p4 = new google.maps.LatLng 39.98670000, -83.04495833 ;  var p5 = new google.maps.LatLng 39.98721389, -83.0455 ;  var p6 = new google.maps.LatLng 39.98236111, -83.04553056 ;    var marker = '&markers=color:redlabel:P'+ p1.lat   + ',' + p1.lng  ;  marker += "&markers=color:redlabel:P" + p2.lat   + "," + p2.lng  ;  marker += "&markers=color:redlabel:P" + p3.lat   + "," + p3.lng  ;  marker += "&markers=color:redlabel:P" + p4.lat   + "," + p4.lng  ;  marker += "&markers=color:redlabel:P" + p5.lat   + "," + p5.lng  ;  marker += "&markers=color:redlabel:P" + p6.lat   + "," + p6.lng  ;    var url = http:  maps.google.com maps api staticmap?zoom=16&size= cid:1   310x415&maptype=roadmap&sensor=true  +marker;  document.getElementById 'map' .setAttribute 'src',url ;    }   132       CHAPTER 7    GPS AND GOOGLE MAPS   Option 2: Dynamic Map  This option combines the dynamic map created earlier with adding multiple markers. Not only did it  allow me to show where the user was relative to the nearest parking location, but users could zoom in  and out relative to their current location.   This example is similar to the previous “Interacting with Google Maps via GPS” example, except   now it has multiple markers set via GPS location versus the one marker that just used geocoding.     Note  This might not work unless you’re near Grandview Avenue. I suggest you update the following markers  with a single one near your current location.   <script          type="text javascript"          src="http:  maps.google.com maps api js?sensor=false">            var map;      var bluedot = new google.maps.MarkerImage ' m images blue_dot.png',              new google.maps.Size 38, 38 ,              new google.maps.Point 0, 0 ,              new google.maps.Point 19, 19                ;        function loadParking   {          var latlng = new google.maps.LatLng 39.98574444, -83.04474722 ;            var myOptions = {              zoom : 16,              center : latlng,              draggable: true,              mapTypeId : google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP          };            map = new google.maps.Map document.getElementById "map_canvas" , myOptions ;          addMarker new google.maps.LatLng 39.98376667, -83.04541944  ;          addMarker new google.maps.LatLng 39.98540278, -83.04531944  ;          addMarker new google.maps.LatLng 39.98600278, -83.04510000  ;          addMarker new google.maps.LatLng 39.98670000, -83.04495833  ;          addMarker new google.maps.LatLng 39.98721389, -83.04514444  ;          addMarker new google.maps.LatLng 39.98236111, -83.04553056  ;          updateLocation = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition successGPS, errorGPS, cid:1    {enableHighAccuracy : true} ;          $ "more a" .css "display","none" ;      }        function successGPS position  {          var latlng = new google.maps.LatLng position.coords.latitude, cid:1    position.coords.longitude ;   133    CHAPTER 7    GPS AND GOOGLE MAPS              var myLocation = new google.maps.Marker {              position: latlng,              map: map,              icon: bluedot,              title:"Me"          } ;      }        function errorGPS   {          alert 'GPS Error' ;      }        var markerCount = 1;        function addMarker latlon  {          var marker = new google.maps.Marker {              position : latlon,              map : map,              icon : "http:  www.google.com mapfiles markerP.png",              title : "Parking "          } ;          markerCount++;      }        $ document .ready function $  {          loadParking  ;      } ;              <div id="map_canvas" style="width:320px;height:410px;margin-left:-15px; cid:1   margin-top:-10px;">       You can see the blue dot in Figure 7-6 at the intersection of Grandview Avenue and 3rd Avenue.   134       CHAPTER 7    GPS AND GOOGLE MAPS   Figure 7-6. GrandviewAve.com parking example      Near Me  The near-me functionality is a little more difficult; here what I wanted to do was pass in the longitude  and latitude, calculate the distance of each of the businesses in the database, and then sort them by  closest distance.   For performance reasons I’ve decided to implement the near-me functionality on the server.   Basically this function takes two parameters, the latitude and longitude of your current location, and  then returns a result set of businesses sorted by distance.    The first variables, $lat and $lon, represent the request variables of longitude and latitude.  The function getDistance takes as parameters two GPS coordinates and then does some   mathematical calculations to return the distance in meters.   The function getFeet   converts the meters returned in getDistance to feet.  The loop sorts through the entire list of business profiles creating two arrays and then sorts the   distance array by shortest number of feet.    Because the profile Array has the same index  profile_id  as the distance array, I can then print the   profile information from the same key as indexed via the distance array.   135    CHAPTER 7    GPS AND GOOGLE MAPS      Because the JavaScript will know the GPS and the server will know how to calculate, I just changed   the location to the new URL once the position was known, to have a semi-interactive page. To update this  near-me functionality, you can set a timeout on the page or just click Near Me again in the navigation.   $lat = $_GET "lat" ;  $lon = $_GET "lon" ;  if  $lat == ""  {  ?>         $  .ready function   {          updateLocation = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition successGPS, errorGPS, cid:1    {enableHighAccuracy : true} ;      } ;      function successGPS position  {          var url = "near.php?lat="+ position.coords.latitude + "&lon=" + cid:1    position.coords.longitude;          location.href=url;      }        function errorGPS   {          alert 'GPS Error' ;      }       <?  } else {  function getDistance $lat1,$lon1,$lat2,$lon2  {      $dlat =  $lat2-$lat1 *pi     180;      $dlon =  $lon2-$lon1 *pi     180;      $a= sin $dlat 2 *sin $dlat 2 +cos $lat1 * pi   180  * cos $lat2 *pi   180  * cid:1    sin $dlon 2  * sin  $dlon 2 ;      $c=2 * atan2 sqrt $a ,sqrt 1-$a  ;      $meters = 6378140 * $c;    in meters      return $meters;  }    function getFeet $lat1,$lon1,$lat2,$lon2  {      $feet = getDistance $lat1,$lon1,$lat2,$lon2  * 3.28;      return round $feet,0 ;  }    foreach  $profiles as $profile  {      if  floatval $profile->gps_lat  != 0 && floatval $profile->gps_long  != 0  {          $distance = getFeet $lat,$lon,$profile->gps_lat,$profile->gps_long ;          $distanceData[$profile->id] = $distance;          $profileData[$profile->id] = $profile;      }  }  asort $distanceData ;       <?      foreach  $distanceData as $id => $dist  {          $tmpProfile = $profileData[$id];   136       CHAPTER 7    GPS AND GOOGLE MAPS           $name = htmlentities  $tmpProfile->name,ENT_QUOTES ;          if  $dist > 500  {              $dist = $dist 5280;              $dist = round $dist,1  .

Grandview Ave. Near Me      137    CHAPTER 7    GPS AND GOOGLE MAPS      Business Markers  The final thing to add on the site are business markers or some way to identify a business via Google Maps.   To make this work, I needed to do the following:   1.  Go to each business and tag the GPS location. This was much more accurate   than geocoding.   2.   I also needed a dynamic Google map with marker capability.   For this you can copy the code from the previous example using the dynamic map.   <script type="text javascript" src="http:  maps.googleapis.com maps  cid:1   api js?sensor=false">            function initialize   {          var latlng = new google.maps.LatLng  gps_lat?>, cid:1     gps_long?> ;          var myOptions = {              zoom: 16,              center: latlng,              mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP          };          var map = new google.maps.Map document.getElementById "basic_map" ,                  myOptions ;          addMarker latlng,map ;      }      $  .ready function   {          initialize  ;      } ;        function addMarker latlon,map  {        var marker = new google.maps.Marker  {          position : latlon,          map : map,          icon : "http:  www.google.com mapfiles marker.png",          title : "Location "        } ;      }          Figure 7-8 is a view of the business profile page towards the bottom. It shows the location of the   business on the map, and you can scroll and zoom this map just like you can with a native app.   138       CHAPTER 7    GPS AND GOOGLE MAPS   Figure 7-8. Business profile marker example      Chapter Summary   This concludes the chapter on GPS and Google Maps. There’s a lot more to Google Maps than the few  areas I’ve touched on in this chapter. You can find out more from the official Google API web site:  http:  code.google.com apis maps .    Before you move on to the next chapter, you should now know how to do the following:      Capture a longitude and latitude from your iOS device     Create a basic Google  road  map     Geocode your location      Add a marker or two via GPS and geocoding to your basic Google map      139    CHAPTER 7    GPS AND GOOGLE MAPS   In the next chapter, I break away a little from building GrandviewAve.com and focus on some of the   newer features in CSS3 and JavaScript that have to do with animation and effects.   These things will add some coolness to the existing part of the mobile site we’ve been building and   show you how to create some exciting things with your mobile app you probably didn’t think were  possible.   140    C H A P T E R  8               Animation and Effects   Animations, transitions, transforms, effects: they are all really about the same thing. They get stuff to  move on your screen without JavaScript.   Transitions are the transition from one CSS rule to another. So a CSS can specify position, color, size   of elements; the transition or movement from one color or position to another can be done purely in  CSS without the need for JavaScript to manage the values.   Transforms perform 2D and 3D rotation or movement of an element in the space of the browser’s   window. These are especially powerful when combined with transitions because you can get simple  effects such as rotating a box or more complicated transitions in 3D.   Animations, notably key frame animations are specially designed CSS meta elements that   encapsulate the entity of a transition and with specific frames and specific start and stop times. These  allow for custom starting and stopping of transitions and allow for greater control with more elements.  The term effects is a broad term for anything fancy you might want to do with the UI some of which  you could only use with images, or in the case of jQuery might involve some fadeIn   or fadeOut   type  of action, causing an element to fade into or out of view.   CSS Tricks   There are a few CSS tricks we’ll want to use in our iOS app because they save us from having to create  images, save in number of downloads, and get us closer to a native app. To give you a taste of some of  the things you can do I’ll show you how to create linear and radial gradients as well as how to create a  reflection of some text. You can see all of these examples in Figure 8-1.   Companion Site Reference   Example 8-1: Follow the link below to run these examples on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter8 tricks.php   Linear Gradients  Linear gradients allow you to specify the gradual changing of one color to the next without the need for  an image. In the example below I create a gradient from a color of gray  999  to white  fff . This is done  inside a 50 × 50 pixel box with a solid black border.   141    CHAPTER 8    ANIMATION AND EFFECTS             .grad1 {          background: -webkit-linear-gradient top, 999, fff ;      }      .demobox {          height: 50px;          width: 50px;          border: 1px solid 000;      }      Linear Gradients        Radial Gradients  Radial gradients are similar to linear in that they save you from having to create an image, but the syntax  can get tricky. Refer to the following site for a detailed explanation: http:  dev.w3.org csswg css3- images ltradial-gradient .   In the example below I create a 100-pixel DIV with a radius of 50 px. This makes a blue colored   sphere.          .big_sphere {          width: 100px;          height: 100px;          border-radius: 50px;          background: -webkit-radial-gradient silver, 0066cc, 000066 ;      }      Radial Grandients        Reflections  Reflections can be done with images or text. In the example below I apply a linear gradient to the  reflection, causing it to fade out the farther away it gets from the top of the screen.          .reflect1 {          -webkit-box-reflect: below 0px -webkit-linear-gradient transparent, cid:1    transparent 10%, silver 90% ;;      }      Reflections    Reflection of Text    142       CHAPTER 8    ANIMATION AND EFFECTS      Figure 8-1. CSS Tricks   CSS Transitions   CSS transitions are the most basic kind of animation. They transition the change of state from one CSS  rule to another, so if that rule is a position rule, such as top:0px to top:100px, then the transition will  move the element from 0 px to 100 px without the need for JavaScript.   To use a transition you need to use the css property -webkit-transition. You can either use   shorthand  in the example below  or you can specify each of the properties.           -webkit-transition-property: This specifies the name of the property that is  transitioning, such as top or left or background.   -webkit-transition-duration: This is the amount of time in seconds the  transition takes.   143    CHAPTER 8    ANIMATION AND EFFECTS              -webkit-transition-timing-function: This specifies how the transition is timed: it  can move at the same rate, it can accelerate towards the end, or slow down  towards the end. Examples are: linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, and  cubic-bezier n,n,n,n .   -webkit-transition-delay: The delay in seconds before the transition starts.   The thing you need to remember about transitions is that they can only occur on a CSS change, so   something needs to force the className property of an element to change. Let’s see how this works in the  examples below.   Companion Site Reference   Example 8-2: Follow the link below to run these examples on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter8 transitions.php   Simple Hover Transition  The first transition is to replace the typical :hover selector over an   tag. The first class demo1a, just does  a standard hover. The second one demo1b, performs a transition to the new color over a one-second period.          .demo1a, .demo1b {          color: red;      }      .demo1a:hover {          color: blue;      }      .demo1b {          -webkit-transition: color 1s ease-in;      }      .demo1b:hover {          color: blue;      }      Transition Demo 1           Link Hover        Link Transition       Simple Animation via Transition  The second transition I show moves this image from its start position at 0,0 to a new position 300,300  within the demo2 box  Figure 8-2 .   In the following transition I use the blue dot created via CSS previously versus an image. Also, rather   than using JavaScript to set the new CSS className, I just use the :hover property.   144       CHAPTER 8    ANIMATION AND EFFECTS     Note  This will not work on the iOS device because there’s no concept of a mouse hover. To get this to work  with iOS you need to use JavaScript to change the className.      demo2 {          width: 300px;          height: 300px;          border: 1px solid 000;      }      demo2 img {          position: relative;          top: 0px;          left: 0px;          -webkit-transition: top 2s ease-in, left 2s ease-in;      }      demo2:hover img {          top: 280px;          left: 280px;      }      .bluedot {          width: 10px;          height: 10px;          border-radius: 5px;          background: -webkit-radial-gradient silver, 0066cc, 000066 ;  }        Transition Demo 2         145    CHAPTER 8    ANIMATION AND EFFECTS      Figure 8-2. CSS Transition Example      So although this example is simple it requires no JavaScript.     Note  CSS animations are faster than JavaScript animations because the CSS extensions are native to your  browser and they don’t have to be interpreted by your browser via JavaScript.   Flashing Image  Because we can’t use the :hover property for iOS I’ll actually add a single line of JavaScript to create a  pulsating blue dot. For this example I just toggle the blue dot’s opacity between 0 and 1 and because of  the –webkit-transition property applied, this pulsates between visible and invisible every half a second.         .bluedot {          width: 10px;   146       CHAPTER 8    ANIMATION AND EFFECTS           height: 10px;          border-radius: 5px;          background: -webkit-radial-gradient silver, 0066cc, 000066 ;          opacity:1;          -webkit-transition-property: opacity;          -webkit-transition-duration: .5s;      }            var bit = 0;      setInterval function   {document.querySelector ".bluedot" .style.opacity= cid:1   bit%2;bit++},1100 ;      Transition Demo 3                  CSS Transforms   The next kind of thing we do with our HTML elements is transform them from their normal position to a  new one. There are two kinds of transforms we do: 2D and 3D.   CSS transforms are all about math, specifically co-ordinate systems. The 2D co-ordinate systems   consist of X- and Y-co-ordinates with the X-axis running along the top of an element to the right and the  Y-axis running down from the top left of the element.   For the 3D co-ordinate system we just add a third axis coming out from the page. You can think of   this like the z-index CSS property where the higher the z-index, the farther out from the page an  element resides.   Companion Site Reference   Example 8-3: Follow the link below to run these examples on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter8 transforms.php   Simple 2D Rotation  In the example below I just take a normal box and rotate it 45 degrees. See Figure 8-3. To build on  transitions from the previous section, I rotate it to 0 degrees when I hover over the element.         .demobox {          height: 100px;          width: 100px;          border: 1px solid 000;          float: left;          margin: 40px;      }      .rot45 {          -webkit-transform: rotate 45deg ;          -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 1s ease-in;   147    CHAPTER 8    ANIMATION AND EFFECTS          }      .rot45:hover {          -webkit-transform: rotate 0deg ;      }      2D Transforms - Rotation        45    Figure 8-3. Simple 2D Transform w Transition      3D Transforms  3D transforms are just as easy as 2D but you need to be cognizant of your co-ordinate system and what  you want to accomplish. If you’re not careful, the effect you are trying to achieve will look strange until  you get your bearings.   Next you take an image and rotate it in the 3D space, specifically 80 degrees around both the x- and   the y-axes and then straighten it again on the transition out. See Figure 8-4.   148    CHAPTER 8    ANIMATION AND EFFECTS         .rotate {          height: 200px;          width: 300px;          border: 1px solid 000;          padding: 0px;      }      .rotate img {          -webkit-transform: perspective 500px  rotate3d 1, 1, 0, 80deg ;          -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 3s;      }      .rotate img:hover {          -webkit-transform: rotate3d 1, 1, 0, 0deg ;      }      3D Transforms - Rotating         Figure 8-4. 3D Rotate Example      149    CHAPTER 8    ANIMATION AND EFFECTS   When you mouse over the image in Figure 8-4, the image moves in 3D. Although it might be difficult   to visualize, remember you can go to the companion site to see the effect in action.   3D Flipping  The final thing we’re going to do is create the “flip” effect using a transition and a transform. I’ve added  the additional CSS properties -webkit-perspective which creates the vantage point of viewing the 3D  transform.   So by rotating an element around the Y-axis  moving top and bottom on the page  an element will   appear to be flipping from front to back around its center.          .flip,.flipped {          height: 210px;          width: 310px;          border: 1px solid 000;          padding: 5px;          background: red;          -webkit-perspective: 800;          -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 1s;      }      .flipped {          background: blue;          -webkit-transform: rotateY 180deg ;      }      3D Flip        Key Frame Animations    Key frame animations allow for finer control of transitions into multiple steps and allow you to call  transitions by name versus having to specify them by individual CSS classNames. To use these CSS  declarations you use the following syntax.   @-webkit-keyframes THE-NAME-OF-YOUR-ANIMATION {      0% or from {css rules}      100% or to {css rules}  }   Then inside your CSS use the following property.   elementid {-webkit-animation: THE-NAME-OF-YOUR-ANIMATION }   Now try a few examples such as changing background colors and moving elements, both of which I   did earlier with a transition.   Companion Site Reference   Example 8-4: Follow the link below to run these examples on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter8 animations.php   150       CHAPTER 8    ANIMATION AND EFFECTS   Changing a Background  The following example creates an animation named bgchange, and applies to the demo1,change1 box and  is set to start one second after the page loads.      demo1 {height:100px;width:100px;border:1px solid ccc;}  @-webkit-keyframes bgchange {    from {background: fff;}    to {background: 999;}  }  demo1.change1 {      -webkit-animation-name: bgchange;      -webkit-animation-duration:2s;      -webkit-animation-timing-function:ease;      -webkit-animation-delay:1s;      -webkit-animation-iteration-count:5;            Animation Demo 1        Moving a Blue Dot  This example has five different keyframes, the start and final followed by three stops in between.  Specifically, this animation takes the blue dot and follows the perimeter of the square and does it five  times in four seconds.      .demobox {height:100px;width:100px;border:1px solid ccc;}  @-webkit-keyframes outside {    0% {top: 0px;left:0px;}    25% {top:0px;left:100px;}    50% {top:100px;left:100px;}    75% {top:100px;left:0px;}    100% {top:0px;left:0px;}  }  .bluedot {      width: 10px;      height: 10px;      border-radius: 5px;      background: -webkit-radial-gradient silver, 0066cc, 000066 ;      position:relative;      -webkit-animation-name: outside;      -webkit-animation-duration:4s;      -webkit-animation-timing-function:ease;      -webkit-animation-delay:1s;      -webkit-animation-iteration-count:5;      -webkit-animation-direction:normal;  }      Animation Demo 4       151    CHAPTER 8    ANIMATION AND EFFECTS                  Adding a Little JavaScript   Because the hover CSS selector does not work in iOS, in order to be effective with using our animations  we need to use a little JavaScript. Specifically we can use JavaScript and its events such as tap or swipe to  initiate a className change, which can start an animation.    Companion Site Reference   Example 8-5. Follow the link below to run these examples on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter8 addingjs.php   Zooming  The first thing I want to test is zooming into an element when I tap it. This can be extremely useful given  the size of an iOS device when it comes to viewing high-resolution images.   The example below sets two classNames, scaledimg is the default class name and scaledimg2 is the   image when it’s zoomed.   pixelate when zoomed.   For this example I’ve created a double resolution image to be scaled; this way the image does not   The JavaScript just uses a bit variable to toggle back and forth. In the final site I’d probably just use   the jQuery toggleClass function, but the code below uses pure JavaScript.          .zoom {          width: 300px;          height: 200px;          border: 1px solid 000;          overflow: hidden;      }      .scaledimg {          -webkit-transform: scale 1 ;          -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 1s ease-in;      }      .scaledimg2 {          -webkit-transform: scale 3 ;          -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 1s ease-in;            var zoombit = 0;      function zoom   {          if  zoombit == 0  {              document.querySelector "zoomimg" .className = "scaledimg2";              document.querySelector "zoombutton" .innerHTML = "Zoom Out";              zoombit = 1;   152       CHAPTER 8    ANIMATION AND EFFECTS           } else {              document.querySelector "zoomimg" .className = "scaledimg";              document.querySelector "zoombutton" .innerHTML = "Zoom In";              zoombit = 0;          }        }      Zooming w JS    Zoom In         Transforming  Rotating   The second use of JavaScript is to rotate an image 360 degrees. For that you can just dynamically add the  transform to the element each time you click the button Start. Also note that the added transition tells  this to occur in two seconds.    You can change the number of times you want it to rotate by changing the angle size and change the   speed of the rotation by changing the transition duration.          .demobox {          height: 100px;          width: 100px;          border: 1px solid 000;          margin: 40px;          -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 2s;      }            var angle = 0;      function rotateme   {          angle = angle + 360;          var box1 = document.querySelector "box1" ;          var asize = "rotate " + angle + "deg ";          box1.style.webkitTransform = asize;      }      2D Transforms w JS    Start          Note  To know when your transition or animation is over add the event listeners called webkitAnimationEnd  and webkitTransitionEnd. These can be added to an element or the document.   153    CHAPTER 8    ANIMATION AND EFFECTS      Effects with jQuery   Both jQuery and jQuery Mobile have effects and animations. All of these take the form of what’s been  previously described, but if you already have these frameworks on your site, it might be easier to use  them rather than crafting your own transitions, transforms, and keyframe animations.   A Few jQuery Effects  These are just a few jQuery effects I’ve used on the present site.    .animate  : A mapping of CSS properties towards which an animation will move.  You combine these properties with the animation’s duration, ease and what to do  when it’s complete.   .fadeIn   : Fades the opacity of an element to one.   .fadeOut  : Fades the opacity of an element to zero.   .hide  : Sets the display property of an element to “none”.   .show  : Sets the display property of an element to “block”.   .slideDown  : Sets the element to slide down out of view.   .slideUp  : Sets the element of the page to slide up into view.   There are also many plugins available that provide other animated functionalities you may want to   use on your mobile site. Check them out at jQuery.com.   jQuery Mobile Effects  We borrowed the effects for jQuery Mobile from jQtouch with minor modifications. To invoke these tran-  sitions on a link or button just add the attribute data-transition=”value”. Those transitions are as follows.   slide: Slides to the left.   slideup: Slides up into view.   slidedown: Slides down out of view.   pop: Pops into view.   fade: Fades out of view.   flip: Flips into view.                                             You can also change the direction of these by adding the attribute data-direction="reverse".   Putting It All Together   For the Grandview.Com mobile site most of the functionality for effects is going to be provided by jQuery  and jQuery Mobile. I won’t write much in the way of custom animations for the site currently except for  zooming of business profile images.   Right now the initial photo of a specific business is just the view of the business as it is on the street.   But sometimes these images can overlap, especially if these businesses are close together.   154       CHAPTER 8    ANIMATION AND EFFECTS   Take, for example, Mohr Wealth Management. It’s in a building shared by three other businesses, so   to highlight this business I thought adding a zoom feature by tapping the photo would be a nice way to  make this business stand out. For that I added the same zoom feature discussed earlier in the chapter; in  fact it’s the same code but with the image from the business versus the static image in the previous  snippet. On the left of Figure 8-5 you see the standard picture, and on the right you see the image zoomed.   Figure 8-5. Zoom Feature Added to Profile   Chapter Summary      In this chapter I talked about all of the stuff generally classified as animation and effects. This is mostly  CSS3 with a few JavaScript hooks allowing things to happen from specific events that occur inside the  user interface of your mobile site.   Before moving on to the next chapter you should know how to do the following.      Use some CSS tricks to make your site faster and slicker without using images.     Create CSS transitions to change properties of your page elements.   155    CHAPTER 8    ANIMATION AND EFFECTS      Use CSS transforms to rotate or move page elements in 2D or 3D space.     Combine multiple transitions with keyframe animations.     Hook these together with some JavaScript.   You should also be familiar with some predefined effects from jQuery and jQuery Mobile.  Of course moving predefined or fake images  via CSS tricks  can be a lot of fun. We’ve only scratched  the surface of what you can do with HTML5. Next I’m going to talk about taking graphics to a whole new  level by exploring the  .         156    C H A P T E R  9               Canvas   Think of canvas as an image you can write on with shapes, lines, text, or other images. But not only can  you write on it, but you can position, transform, manipulate, rotate, and do many other kinds of things,  all with JavaScript. The   tag itself is only a container for graphics, the way a   or   is  a container for text for structural or textual elements on a web page.   The   HTML element supports all the global attributes including ID and class, but adds two   other attributes: width and height. These attributes take pixels as the type so a tag <canvas id="can"  width="300" height="300"> , will produce a canvas of 300  cid:1  300 pixels.   In this chapter I talk about how to do the following.      Draw shapes and text.     Work with images by performing real-time image processing.         Update the GrandviewAve.com mobile site with a 2D Game for Sales & Specials   Animate those images to create the foundations for a 2D Game.   and provide for a better footer navigation.   The   element itself is very powerful, but let’s start with something basic.   Canvas Basics   First in Chapter 2 I created a simple canvas element and drew a rectangle and as long as your DOCTYPE  was HTML5 you were able to paste this code into any HTML page and your browser would show you a  red square.          var canvas = document.querySelector 'simplecanvas' ;  var ctx = canvas.getContext '2d' ;  ctx.fillStyle='rgb 255,0,0 ';  ctx.fillRect 0,0,100,100 ;      You can see from this example you need two basic objects, the canvas and the context.   157    CHAPTER 9    CANVAS      Canvas Object  This object is a standard HTML element. You can reference it via document.getElementById or  document.querySelector ELEMENT_ID . This object has two properties outside the global attributes called  height and width. It has three methods:   toDataURL  : Returns string data representing the image in the canvas.   toBlob  : Returns a blob object representing the image in the canvas.   getContext  : Returns the drawing context, currently either 2D or Experimental- WebGL  3D .   2D Context Object  This is the drawing context. It contains all the methods used to draw, rotate, and otherwise manipulate  the drawing space. Some of the method categories are:   State: Methods like save   and restore   change the state of the context; this is  useful when transforming or clearing the context.   Transformations: Methods like scale  , rotate  , translate  , transform  , and  setTransform   all allow you to transform the objects in the context. Much as CSS  transitions allow you to move objects on the screen, these allow you to move  around the stuff you’ve drawn.   Rectangles: Methods like clearRect  , fillRect  , and strokeRect   allow you to  work with rectangles in the context.   Paths: Methods like beginPath  , moveTo  , arc  , fill  , and so on are all  designed to allow you to draw on your context from pixel to pixel.    Images: Methods like drawImage  , createImageData  , and getImageData   allow  you to get images from the browser or a URL, put them into your context at  specific positions, and work with and manipulate them.   There are a slew of other methods and properties; for a more detailed explanation of those I’d   recommend you check them out from the W3C.   http:  www.w3.org TR html5 the-canvas-element.html                                 Now on to some examples.   Drawing Examples   The first set of examples focuses on some basic drawing. We create a few different canvas elements on  the page for the different things we want to draw: rectangle, triangle, circle, and text.   Next we want to draw these when the page is done loading, and for that we specify a function in the   window.onload event, but to start we need to add a little CSS and some HTML markup for the different  example   elements.        158       CHAPTER 9    CANVAS   Companion Site Reference   Example 9-1: Follow the link below to run these examples on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter9 drawing.php          .workarea {border: 1px solid 000;}      Rectangle        Triangle        Circle        Text              window.onload = function   {          drawRectangle  ;          drawTriangle  ;          drawCircle 75, 75, 50 ;          drawText  ;      }        Drawing a Rectangle  The first function draws a rectangle via the drawRectangle   function. This creates the canvas object  from the document.querySelector and creates a context object which it derives from the canvas. Add this  function between the   tags in your markup.   Once we have a context, specify the fillStyle which lets you set the color of the context, in this case   red. Next you can call fillRect xStart, yStart, xEnd, yEnd  with the parameters of the co-ordinates  starting at the top left and ending at the bottom right. In the example below it creates a red square  starting at 25,25, and ending at 100,100    co-ordinates are measured from top-left . You can see  the results in Figure 9-1, along with the next example.   function drawRectangle   {      var canvas = document.querySelector 'rectangle' ;      var ctx = canvas.getContext '2d' ;      ctx.fillStyle = 'rgb 255,0,0 ';      ctx.fillRect 25, 25, 100, 100 ;  }   159    CHAPTER 9    CANVAS   Figure 9-1. Drawing a Rectangle and Lines   Drawing with Lines  Let’s draw the triangle next. Note there’s no “draw shape” method available as in drawRectangle above;  here we actually need to draw three lines.   As with the rectangle we need to grab the canvas object from the DOM and derive a context object.  Next, set the color of the strokes with the strokeStyle method, in this case green. We start the path with  beginPath, then move it to our first co-ordinate. This is followed by lineTo our second and third co- ordinates. Finally we close the path with closePath then stroke the line to create the triangle in Figure 9-1.   function drawTriangle   {          var canvas = document.querySelector 'triangle' ;          var ctx = canvas.getContext '2d' ;          ctx.strokeStyle = 'rgb 0,255,0 ';          ctx.beginPath  ;          ctx.moveTo 25, 125 ;          ctx.lineTo 75, 25 ;   160   w              ctx.lineTo 125, 125 ;          ctx.closePath  ;          ctx.stroke  ;      }   CHAPTER 9    CANVAS   Drawing Circles  Drawing a circle is a little bit of a combination of the two techniques we’ve just used. You have a method  called arc which lets you specify the center in x–y co-ordinates, a radius and size of the arc in radians, as  well as whether it should be filled or stroked. I’ve created a drawCircle method to shorten the amount of  ceremony required to create a circle by eliminating most of it and just passing the x–y and radius  parameters to a single function. You can also specify a lineWidth, and strokeStyle with additional  parameters or constant values.    In the example below I just specify a blue circle with a line width of three pixels.   function drawCircle x, y, radius  {      var canvas = document.querySelector 'circle' ;      var ctx = canvas.getContext "2d" ;      ctx.beginPath  ;      ctx.arc x, y, radius, 0, Math.PI * 2, false ;      ctx.lineWidth = 3;      ctx.strokeStyle = "rgb 0,0,255 ";      ctx.stroke  ;      ctx.closePath  ;  }   Drawing Text  To draw text on the screen is very easy. It’s so easy you might even consider this as opposed to creating  images or using Flash for text. It will dramatically improve the speed of your mobile web app while  maintaining the fonts you want to show.   In the example below I specify the font with the font method on the context. The text alignment and   color are set using textAlign and fillStyle. The final method fillText   is where you put the text you  want to draw followed by its position.    Because the example has text alignment of center, just place the text in the middle of the     plus a little buffer of 10 pixels.  You can remove this by using the textBaseline property.  You can see the  result in Figure 9-2.   function drawText   {      var canvas = document.querySelector 'txt' ;      var ctx = canvas.getContext '2d' ;      ctx.font = "30px Arial";      ctx.textAlign = "center";      ctx.fillStyle = "blue";      ctx.fillText "This is text.", canvas.width   2,  canvas.height   2   + 10 ;  }   161    CHAPTER 9    CANVAS                     162   Figure 9-2. Drawing Circles and Text      Interaction Example   The next example uses a little bit from Chapter 6. Here we track a touch event and calculate a swipe  event all from within the   300  cid:1  300 pixel element. The effect is a page that paints dots on the  screen and erases them with a swipe. You can see this in Figure 9-3 or try the interaction for yourself on  the companion site.        CHAPTER 9    CANVAS   Companion Site Reference   Example 9-2: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter9 interact.php   First, we need to set up the  .          .workarea {border: 1px solid 000; }      Touch Canvas    Touch to make a dot. Swipe left to clear.                var canvas = document.querySelector "touch_canvas" ;      var ctx = canvas.getContext "2d" ;      var curX,curY;        var startX = 0;      var startY = 0;      var endX = 0;      var endY = 0;        Next we add two events ontouchstart and ontouchend, which modify some page variables called   startX, startY, endX, and endY. These variables are used to calculate whether a swipe motion was  detected.      Note  I’m using 40 pixels to be sensitive to the swipe event. You might try adjusting this based on your own  testing and type of interaction you prefer.   If a swipe motion is detected from within the ontouchend function, then it will clear the canvas.   Otherwise the example will place a circle. You can easily adjust this to draw lines or change pen sizes  and colors. The way this works is just by measuring the distance captured between touchStart and  touchEnd events.   canvas.ontouchstart = function evt  {      startX = evt.pageX;      startY = evt.pageY;      touchXY evt ;  }    canvas.ontouchend = function evt  {      endX = evt.pageX;   163    The helper function touchXY   allows us to update the curX and curY co-ordinates, then calls the   drawCircle   function to place the circle on the canvas, Whereas drawCircle   performs the same  function as the earlier example but without the radius parameter.   CHAPTER 9    CANVAS          endY = evt.pageY;      if   startX - endX  < -40  {          clearCanvas        }  }       function touchXY e  {          curX = e.pageX - canvas.offsetLeft;          curY = e.pageY - canvas.offsetTop;          drawCircle curX, curY ;      }    function drawCircle x, y  {          ctx.beginPath  ;          ctx.arc x, y, 10, 0, Math.PI * 2, false ;          ctx.lineWidth = 3;          ctx.strokeStyle = "rgb 0,0,255 ";          ctx.fillStyle = "rgb 0,0,255 ";          ctx.stroke  ;          ctx.closePath  ;          ctx.fill  ;      }   To clear the canvas I just need to call clearRect from the 0,0  top-left  to the canvas width and  canvas height  bottom-right , then pop this state to the top of the canvas with the restore method.   function clearCanvas   {      ctx.clearRect 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height ;      ctx.restore  ;  }   164       CHAPTER 9    CANVAS   Figure 9-3. Interaction Example      Image Manipulation Example   var img = new Image  ;  img.src = " images some.png";   JavaScript always had the ability to work with images as objects via the Image   object, like this:    Using the same mechanism you can grab an image and set it to a specific location within your   In the following example I’ll show you how you can do more with the   elements and   images than just draw things. I’ll show you how to do some basic image manipulation with JavaScript, so  you can manipulate images without using offline or server side logic or Flash.     .        165    CHAPTER 9    CANVAS      Companion Site Reference   Example 9-3: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter9 images.php   The first part of this example sets everything up. First create the original image called the-cangle- lab.jpg. Add a couple of buttons: clear which will clear the canvas and gray which will cause the entire  source image to be converted to grayscale.    To make things a little more interactive we can create a slider which will allow us to view certain   colors of gray with a range from 0 to 255.    Original Image       Processed Image    Clear    Grayscale          Threshold <input type="range" min="0" max="255" onchange= cid:1   "threshhold this.value " id="slider" ><span          id="thresh">                Some Set-Up Stuff  Once the basics are set up we need to do a little housekeeping on the JavaScript and create a few global  variables such as the img, canvas, and ctx.    Next, so that we populate the slider value onload we specify the innerHTML of the     tag.           var img = new Image  ;      img.src = "images the-candle-lab.jpg";      var canvas = document.querySelector "processor" ;      var ctx = canvas.getContext "2d" ;        window.onload = function   {          document.querySelector "thresh" .innerHTML = document.querySelector "slider" .value;      }        Next, let’s create a method called gray   to create the gray effect. This method just calls the   threshold function because that’s where we put all the logic for making an image gray.    function gray   {      threshhold 0 ;  }   166       CHAPTER 9    CANVAS   In addition to clearing the canvas we also want to reset the value of the slider text and reset the   slider to halfway.   function clearCanvas   {      document.querySelector "slider" .value = 128;      document.querySelector "thresh" .innerHTML = 128;      ctx.clearRect 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height ;      ctx.restore  ;  }   Grayscale and Thresholding  Before getting into how to grayscale an image I want to talk a little bit about the color components of  images.   First, the images we use on the web are RGB images. RGB stands for red-green-blue and it’s the   combination of these three colors that gives us all the colors we see. Images that have less green and less  red are more blue, but images that have equal amounts of all three colors appear to be gray.   Just as in CSS3 you can create a color of a class by specifying green to be a rgb 0,255,0  value. You   can also grab each pixel of an image and by specifying the x- and y-co-ordinates of the image you can get  its component colors if you know how to look.   In addition, by knowing how to get each of these color values you can perform basic image   processing such as converting an image to grayscale or creating a threshold filter. Converting the  grayscale images might be trivial, however, you use the same kinds of logic if you’re writing face  recognition or augmented reality applications.   To create a threshold filter you just need to take a value of a color and say that you’re going to do   something with anything above or below this value. In the example below I first take the gray value. This  is the average of the red, green, and blue components of a single pixel.  Then I compare this value to a  number called a threshold. Based on the numerical comparison I just convert that pixel to white or leave  it alone.   The process I use below is first to grab the image data via the getImageData method, then to create a  new imageData object via createImageData. Next I get these data as an array and loop through them. The  array contains all the RGB information in this order.      Data[i] = red color     Data[i+1] = green color     Data[i+2] = blue color     Data[i+3] = alpha color  opacity channel    To get the gray value I just add the RGB colors together, and then average them to get the gray value.  Finally to show the converted image, I just need to place these data into the newData array followed   by the invoking putImageData method on the context.   function threshhold val  {        document.querySelector "thresh" .innerHTML = val;        document.querySelector "slider" .value = val;        ctx.drawImage img, 0, 0 ;        var imageData = ctx.getImageData 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height ;        var newImageData = ctx.createImageData 300, 200 ;        var data = imageData.data;        var newData = newImageData.data;        for  var i = 0; i < data.length; i += 4  {            var red = data[i];    red   167    CHAPTER 9    CANVAS                var green = data[i + 1];    green            var blue = data[i + 2];    blue            var alpha = data[i + 3];            var gray =  red + green + blue    3            if  gray < val  {                gray = 255;    white            }            newData[i] = gray;            newData[i + 1] = gray;            newData[i + 2] = gray;            newData[i + 3] = alpha;    not used        }        ctx.putImageData newImageData, 0, 0 ;    }   In Figure-9-4 I slid the threshold to 88 and you can see the effect this value has on the original image   above it.   Figure 9-4. Working with Images      168    CHAPTER 9    CANVAS      Animation Example   Next we try animating a few images. Specifically, I want to create a “slot-machine” effect for three  images. This example just shows one image moving, but I complete the effect for three images in  “Putting It All Together.”   Companion Site Reference   Example 9-4: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter9 animation.php   For this example we have a button that tells the spin animation to start. The   is a 300  cid:1  80  pixel canvas on which we place three images an equal distance apart. We can place the three images on  the page initially via the window.onload event.   To set up for the spin effect we need to create a few global variables: y for the dynamic position of   the moving image, counter to determine how many times around the canvas my image travels, and  spacing which determines how many pixels the image travels per interval.          .workarea {border: 1px solid 000;}      Slot Machine Example    Spin                 var canvas = document.querySelector "slot_canvas" ;      var ctx = canvas.getContext "2d" ;      var delay = 1000   30;    30 FPS        var img1 = new Image  ;      img1.src = "images grandview-cafe_thumb.jpg";        var img2 = new Image  ;      img2.src = "images the-candle-lab_thumb.jpg";        var img3 = new Image  ;      img3.src = "images staufs_thumb.jpg";        window.onload = function   {          ctx.drawImage img1, 10, 10 ;          ctx.drawImage img2, 110, 10 ;          ctx.drawImage img3, 210, 10 ;      }        function clearCanvas   {          ctx.clearRect 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height ;          ctx.restore  ;   169    CHAPTER 9    CANVAS       }       var y,counter,spacing;      function callSpin   {          y = 10;          counter = 0;          spacing = 10;          spin  ;      }      Spinning the Images  First let’s simplify some terms. The slot machine has three wheels that spin with different images. We  call those w1, w2, and w3. Each wheel has the same number of images, i1, i2, and i3. Each wheel has all  the images.   Spinning the wheels is nothing more than changing the position of the images i1 to i3 as time   increases. To move the wheels around we just need to call the setTimeout function once. It then calls  itself on every delay  which in our case is 30 frames per second or about 33 milliseconds .    Because on each call to the timeOut it increases y by 10, the images i1–i3 look as if they are moving   around and around on a wheel.   In Figure 9-5 the first wheel is halfway between i1 and i2.   function spin   {          clearCanvas  ;             slot 1          ctx.drawImage img1, 10, y ;          ctx.drawImage img2, 10, y - 80 ;          ctx.drawImage img3, 10, y - 160 ;          ctx.drawImage img1, 10, y - 240 ;             slots 2&3          ctx.drawImage img2, 110, 10 ;          ctx.drawImage img3, 210, 10 ;             slot 1          if  y > 240  {              y = 0;              counter ++;          }else{          y = y + spacing;          }          if  counter < 2  setTimeout 'spin  ', delay ;      }   170       CHAPTER 9    CANVAS      Figure 9-5. Slot Machine Example   Putting It All Together   So far Grandview Avenue is coming along rather nicely but it’s missing something fun: it’s missing a  game. I had to think a little bit on what I wanted to do for a game because I’ve not gone and asked any of  the businesses if they wanted to participate. I had ideas such as “The Avenue Hunt” which would  combine with GPS in a virtual scavenger hunt. I had even thought about doing something with  augmented reality, but given that it’s almost winter in Ohio, I decided against spending long hours  outside for testing.   So I started looking at the functionality and content that I already had on the site that needed a little   spicing up and the first thing that came to mind was Sales & Specials. Currently I had nothing to make this  page stand out and get noticed. It was just a plain old list with some information, but it did not have the  coolness factor. So that was it, I needed to add the slot machine game created earlier with Sales & Specials.   The structure of the game is like this.       Three wheels and three canvases: each slot is either a Grandview Avenue icon, or  an image from one of the businesses offering a Sale & Special.   171    CHAPTER 9    CANVAS                   The default icon for each of the wheels is the Grandview Ave Icon.   There is a button that says spin at the bottom.   Spinning causes each slot to display a random set of icons until they all stop.   They always hit a business selected at random and “win” the Sale & Special.   One way to create these wheels is with a little Ajax to retrieve all Sales & Specials from the server and  a Random   function. I’ve encapsulated the Sales & Specials information inside a JavaScript object called  SalesSpecial.           var ss = [];       function SalesSpecial id, img  {           this.id = id;           this.img = img;       }         $  .ready function   {           $.getJSON ' api sales.php', function data  {               $.each data, function id, img  {                   ss.push new SalesSpecial id, img  ;               } ;           } ;       } ;         function getRandom   {           return Math.floor Math.random   * ss.length + 1 ;       }         var winner = getRandom  ;       var i1 = new Image  .src = ss[getRandom  ];       var i2 = new Image  .src = ss[getRandom  ];       var i3 = new Image  .src = ss[getRandom  ];         172       CHAPTER 9    CANVAS   Figure 9-6. Sales & Specials Game using Canvas      Figure 9-6 shows the finished game. To get the code for the game, go to the mobile site at   http:  www.grandviewave.com m, click on Sales and view the page source.   Chapter Summary   The goal of this chapter was to introduce you to the   element I’ve used to draw on and even for  controlled animation via a simple slot machine game.    Before moving on to the next chapter you should know how to do the following.      Draw lines, rectangles, circles, and images with the canvas element.     Be able to use the canvas as a way to interact with the touch interface.     Be able to animate with the canvas.   173    CHAPTER 9    CANVAS            Optionally you might be interested in knowing how to inspect an image for colors   or be able to perform image processing.   The final piece of interactive code you need to make your mobile application complete is audio and   video, and that’s what I talk about next.   174   1   C H A P T E R  10               Audio and Video   This is perhaps the simplest of all the chapters so far; the information here will enable you to program  your HTML5 web application to render audio and video without Adobe Flash or other custom code, by  using the   and   tags and their elements.    The examples in this section are short and to the point, but the features provided by these new tags   will allow you to combine a little bit of GPS to create an interactive tour for the Grandview Avenue  sample app.   First I’ll provide you with a short overview of these new tags.   Overview of the Audio and Video Tags   Let’s take a look at the elements and attributes of the new  ,  ,   and    elements.      The   tag supports .wav, .mp3, .m4a and .acc files.    Table 10-1. Attributes of the   tag.  Attribute   Value   Description   autoplay   controls   loop   preload   src   -   -   -   -   Autoplays the audio when the page is ready.   Displays the controls for the player.   Run the audio in a loop.   Loads the audio when the page loads.   url   Identifies the source of the audio to be played.   You’ll see some examples incorporating the   tag in iOS applications later in the chapter.   175    CHAPTER 10    AUDIO AND VIDEO         iOS supports only MPEG4 and H.264 video.   Table 10-2. Attributes of the   tag.  Attribute   Value   Description   audio   autoplay   controls   height   width   loop   poster   preload   src   muted   Mutes the audio portion of the video.   -   -   pixels   pixels   url   -   -   url   Autoplays the video when the page is ready.   Displays the controls for the player.   Specifies the height of the player in pixels.   Specifies the width of the player in pixels.   Runs the video in a loop.   Specifies the URL of an image for the video.   Loads the video when the page loads.   Identifies The source of the video to be played.   The following code snippet is a simple example of how to play an mp4 video file using the     tag. This example also uses the source child element, which we'll look at next.               Attributes like controls don’t have to take values in HTML5, but I've added them for consistency. All  you need to do is enter  , and that’s sufficient for the tag. Remember, this isn’t XHTML.      Used in conjunction with either the   or   tags, this child element helps to defines the  source of the media.   Table 10-3. Attributes of the   tag.  Attribute   Value   Description   CSS Media Query  See  Chapter 3    Specifies what media resource is optimized for giving  multiple media types for different devices.   url   The URL of the media.   Mime Type: video mp4  The Mime type of src.   media   src   type   176       CHAPTER 10    AUDIO AND VIDEO   There are many different types of source media you can use with your audio and video tags.     Note  You may wonder why you need to include the Mime Type. This is so the browser can determine whether  it can play the video without having to download it.      This tag can be used to define other types of embedded content, like a .swf file.   Table 10-4. Attributes of the   tag.  Attribute   Value   Description   height   src   type   width   pixels   url   Specifies the height of the embedded content.   The URL of the embedded content.   Mime Type   The Mime type of src.   Pixels   Specifies the width of the embedded content.   Audio and Video Examples   Before we add the audio and video elements to the Grandview Avenue sample app, here are some simple  examples that will allow you to get started right away.    Using the   Tag  The use of the   tag is very easy.   Companion Site Reference   Example 10-1: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.   http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter10 audio.php   Just specify the following tag in your HTML page and that’s it; you get audio played through your   browser with no plugins or special software. It’s as simple as that!       177    CHAPTER 10    AUDIO AND VIDEO      This tag includes the controls as a parameter. You can see the results in Figure 10-1.   Figure 10-1. The   Tag in Action      An Example Using   and     Video is just as easy as audio, but you have more options for the video player controls and a few more  attributes you can use. You can also see that in this example I used the   tag to specify a little bit  more about the video type used, and I’ve used JavaScript to play it automatically on loading  onload .   Companion Site Reference   Example 10-2: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter10 video.php   178    CHAPTER 10    AUDIO AND VIDEO                  var v = document.querySelector 'myvid' ;  v.play  ;      Figure 10-2 shows the resulting video page. The video is set to autoplay, and the image on the right   is what you will see after touching Done.   Figure 10-2. The   Tag in Action      179    CHAPTER 10    AUDIO AND VIDEO   Putting It All Together   To demonstrate audio and video with the Grandview Avenue app, I’d like to combine GPS with audio  and video to give virtual tours. For this we’ll create a number of tour locations for both audio and video  elements and tag each of them to specific GPS coordinates. When the user reaches a tagged location, the  appropriate tour element will play.   The basic structure of all the tours will go like this:   Tour Overview   Tour Detail  Audio and Video    1.  2.  3.  Tour Map  All Locations with Clickable Markers    Creating the Tour Landing Pages  To create a tour page we’ll need to use a little HTML and list functionality provided from jQuery mobile.  You can see in the Landing Page 1 code that I had to modify the CSS a little bit to get it to look good   shown in bold . You might do the same or just modify the CSS of the site for the page you’re on. In this  section we’ll also write the code that links to a map of the audio or video tour stops.   Landing Page 1  The first page just lays out and separates the audio from the video tours. Again to work around some  jQuery Mobile features, I had to add   tags so the text would show. The links to atours.php and  vtours.php are pages that represent the code in Landing Page 2.    Audio & Video Tours    Click below to take a tour of The cid:1    Avenue.                                Audio Tours        Five audio tours of Grandview  Avenue either sequential  or by nearest cid:1    location.                                     Video Tours        Three video tours of Grandview  Avenue either sequential cid:1   or by nearest location.               You can see the results on the left side in Figure 10-3.   180       CHAPTER 10    AUDIO AND VIDEO   Landing Page 2  The second landing page, once the user has chosen between audio and video tours, links to a map view  of the audio or video detail.             South Avenue    A short description of  Grandview Avenue looking  north cid:1    from First Avenue.        This code displays the page shown on the right side of Figure 10-3.   Figure 10-3. Tour Landing Pages      181    CHAPTER 10    AUDIO AND VIDEO      When you click any link on the second landing page, you’ll be taken to a map view of the page    Figure 10-4 , and it will automatically play the audio file associated with the location clicked.    Tagging the Audio Tour Spots  At the end of this example, you’ll see that playing the associated audio files is a fairly simple step. But  before I discuss that, let’s add a little GPS to identify where these tours will originate. I’m going to show  you how I set up the audio tour spots, but you can see both audio and video tours in action by following  the links on the companion site.   1.  1st Avenue & Grandview Avenue  2.  Staufs Coffee  On Grandview Avenue   3.  3rd Avenue & Grandview Avenue  4.  Caribou Coffee  On Grandview Avenue   5.  5th Avenue & Grandview   Figure 10-4. All Audio Spots on Google Map      182       CHAPTER 10    AUDIO AND VIDEO   To set-up everything to work, I’ll just reuse some of the code I created in Chapter 7  for the parking  markers. All I need to do here is adjust the following addMarker statements to the locations I’ll be talking  about in the audio tour.     Note  If you’re trying this example for yourself, remember to adjust these coordinates to some place close to  you or someplace generic to the center of your map, otherwise unless you’re in Grandview Heights, Ohio, the  example won’t work as intended.   addMarker new google.maps.LatLng 39.98213, -83.0451  ;    South Grandview  addMarker new google.maps.LatLng 39.983769,-83.044948  ;    Staufs Coffee  addMarker new google.maps.LatLng 39.985027,-83.044707  ;    Grandview Cafe  addMarker new google.maps.LatLng 39.986901,-83.044939  ;    Caribou Coffee  addMarker new google.maps.LatLng 39.988613,-83.044334  ;    North Grandview   The next important part is to link the audio files to markers on a Google map. To keep the   programming simple, I’ll just use the same sequence as the location markers just shown to match the file  names I’ll want to load and play. So as a part of the addMarker   function, I’ll bind a click event to the  marker so that when it’s clicked or touched it will play the audio.   var markerCount = 1;  function addMarker latlon  {    var marker = new google.maps.Marker {      position : latlon,      map : map,      icon : "http:  www.google.com mapfiles markerA.png",      title : "Audio Spot",      clickable: true    } ;      google.maps.event.addListener marker, 'click', function   {      playAudio markerCount ;    } ;    markerCount++;   }     function playAudio audioFile  {      var audioControl = document.querySelector "audio_control" ;      audioControl.src = 'media tour_' + audioFile + '.m4a';      audioControl.play  ;    }   Finally, because you will originally navigate to this page via the audio list from Figure 10-4, it will   need to read the location.hash and then correctly load the audio or video file.   $ document .ready function   {    loadMap  ;    playAudio location.hash ;     } ;   183    CHAPTER 10    AUDIO AND VIDEO   Chapter Summary   The goal of this chapter was to introduce you to some new media elements for audio and video.   While using these elements was simpler than the topics covered in previous chapters, in this chapter  I’ve started to show how you can incorporate features covered in previous chapters, like GPS, to provide  some really neat functionality for your mobile web app.   Before moving on to the next chapter you should know how to      Use the   element to load audio.     Use the   element to load video.     Dynamically load and play media based on user input or other information like   GPS.   While you can’t take photos, video, or record voice recordings as of the current versions of iOS and   Mobile Safari, there are some native services you can take advantage of, like making your iPhone beep or  reading the accelerometer, and that’s what I’m going to talk about next.         184    C H A P T E R  11               Integrating with Native Services   In Chapter 7 I talked about interacting with GPS and Google Maps. But did you know in addition to GPS  you can interact with the Compass, Gyroscope, and the Accelerometer on your iOS device?    What about using your web app to interact with twitter or send a text message?   This chapter tells you how to do this. Although you can’t interact with your camera via Mobile   Safari, I show you how to do that with a native app in Chapter 15.   Orientation   The orientation API allows you to interact with the Compass, Gyroscope, and Accelerometer on your iOS  device through Mobile Safari. This makes it possible to interact with the world around you relative to the  direction your device is facing and how it’s moving  rotating or accelerating .   So whether you need to know what direction you’re facing, or something as simple as to whether   your iPhone is facing up, down, or portrait or landscape, the orientation API gives you the ability to  access this information with simple JavaScript.   To access this information you need to capture the event onorientationchange. It is fired each time   the device changes orientation. This is more complicated than the landscape or portrait orientation  defined earlier via CSS3 media selectors. It contains a lot more information.     Note  For pictorial representations of the different axes please refer to the following reference.  http:  dev.w3.org geo api spec-source-orientation.html.    Properties  iOS provides five read-only properties that are passed when the onorientationchange event fires. Some  are intuitive, like compass direction, but others are more complicated relative measurements based on  feedback from the iPhone’s gyroscope as the phone is moved.    webkitCompassHeading  This displays the direction the iOS device is pointing as you are holding it, relative to north.        0 degrees is North,    185    CHAPTER 11    INTEGRATING WITH NATIVE SERVICES                90 degrees is East,    180 degrees is South    270 degrees is West.   webkitCompassAccuracy  This provides the accuracy of the webkitCompassHeading reading. I’ve personally not seen it get any better  than within 10 degrees of the true compass direction.   alpha  z-axis   The alpha property is the rotation of the phone, in degrees, around its z-axis. This is the axis  perpendicular to the screen  where the positive is out of the screen . The alpha property is not a  compass direction; it is a relative measurement, usually based on the phone’s starting position before  the onorientationchange event fired.   beta  x-axis   The beta property works in the same way as the alpha property, but it gives the rotation of the phone  around its x-axis, which is the axis that runs from the left to the right of the screen.   gamma  y-axis   Similarly, the gamma property gives the rotation of the phone around its y-axis, which is the axis running  from the bottom of the screen to the top.    An Example Using Orientation  The following example updates a set of   tags onorientationchange. The properties are read-only  and the event fires very fast.    Companion Site Reference   Example 11-1: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter11 orientation.php    Compass    Current Heading is       Compass Accuracy is       Z-Axis alpha  is       X-Axis beta  is       Y-Axis gamma  is         window.ondeviceorientation = function e  {      var heading = e.webkitCompassHeading;      var accuracy = e.webkitCompassAccuracy;   186    CHAPTER 11    INTEGRATING WITH NATIVE SERVICES             var alpha = e.alpha;      var beta = e.beta;      var gamma = e.gamma;      document.querySelector "heading" .innerHTML = heading;      document.querySelector "accuracy" .innerHTML = accuracy;      document.querySelector "alpha" .innerHTML = alpha;      document.querySelector "beta" .innerHTML = beta;      document.querySelector "gamma" .innerHTML = gamma;  }        Note  I ran this same code on my MacBook Pro and under Google Chrome I was able to receive readings from  the beta and gamma elements. Try it and you can get orientation information from your MacBook Pro, but it does  not work in Safari or the iOS Simulator.   Acceleration   Acceleration defines how fast your iOS device is accelerating through space. From physics, acceleration  is defined as the rate of change of velocity. So even if you’re going very fast this value will not change  unless you’re changing velocity, that is, speeding up or slowing down.   Like onorientationchange, the event ondevicemotion allows for reading the motion of your iOS device.   Properties  iOS provides four read-only properties that are passed when the ondevicemotion event fires. These are as  follows.   acceleration  This object returns data in meters per second squared using the following parameters. The axes are the  same ones we met earlier when looking at the alpha, beta, and gamma rotations.             x: This is positive towards the right of the screen.  y: This is positive towards the top of the screen.  z: This is positive out of the screen.   accelerationIncludingGravity  This works the same way as the acceleration property, except with gravity factored into the result.   Interval  This is the interval in milliseconds since the last motion event.   187    CHAPTER 11    INTEGRATING WITH NATIVE SERVICES      RotationRate  This is the rate of rotation around the three axes. It uses the properties alpha, beta, and gamma like the  orientation event, but measures how fast they are changing, rather than giving an overall change in  degrees.   An Example Using Acceleration   This example measures the acceleration for each axis. I have also created another variable called MaxX  which records the maximum acceleration in the x-direction. Most of the time while you’re holding your  iOS device each of these properties  acceleration.x, acceleration.y, and acceleration.z  will be below one.   Companion Site Reference   Example 11-2: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter11 motion.php    Acceleration    X Acceleration       Y Acceleration       Z Acceleration       Rotation Rate       Max X         var maxX = 0;  window.ondevicemotion = function e  {      var x = e.acceleration.x;      if  x > maxX  maxX = x;      var y = e.acceleration.y;      var z = e.acceleration.z;      var rotationRate = e.rotationRate;      document.querySelector "x" .innerHTML = x;      document.querySelector "y" .innerHTML = y;      document.querySelector "z" .innerHTML = z;      document.querySelector "rotationRate" .innerHTML = rotationRate.alpha + "," + cid:1    rotationRate.beta + "," + rotationRate.gamma;      document.querySelector "maxX" .innerHTML = maxX;  }      Some of the ways you could use this information would be with games or augmented reality mobile  web apps. Although the information above is basic, combining it with some other aspects of interactivity  can be quite powerful.   188    CHAPTER 11    INTEGRATING WITH NATIVE SERVICES      Custom Links   Let’s say that you want to integrate with a native app on your iOS device. What do you do? Custom APIs?  Write a Native App? No. You can use custom URLs.   I show you several examples below on how to integrate with other apps such as mail, Facebook, or  twitter and all you need to do is create a custom URL scheme with a few request parameters. If you’ve  used mailto: then you’re already familiar with these and don’t even know it.     Note  Custom URL schemes are not APIs and can change or be updated at any time. For a complete list of URL  schemes go to http:  handleopenurl.com .    Some of the examples are built in; others you will need to have the associated applications installed   on your iOS device.   Companion Site Reference   Example 11-3: Follow the link below to run these examples on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter11 links.php   Mail  This allows you to send mail from your website via iOS Mail.     mailto:     Additional URL parameters are:   ?cc=asecond@email.com  &subject=subject_of_email  &body=body_of_email   For more information refer to RFC 2368; this is the URL specification guideline for mailto links.   SMS  The following example sends an SMS  text message  to a specific phone number. So by adding this URL  link, your device will open an SMS window ready for you to write a message.     sms:     MMS  The following sends a multimedia message to a specific phone number, so like SMS it opens a window,  except now you have access to your multimedia SMS window.     mms:     189    CHAPTER 11    INTEGRATING WITH NATIVE SERVICES   Telephone  The following allows you to call a phone number.     tel:       Note  iOS will do this automatically if it detects a sequence of numbers resembling a phone number. To turn  this off you must use the following meta tag,  .   Printing  The following line prints a page.     print     Music  The following opens your music library.     Music     Maps  The following opens Google Maps.   YouTube  The following opens a video on YouTube.   iTunes   The following opens an app in iTunes.     maps.google.com       www.youtube.com      <a href="itms:  itunes.apple.com us app grandview-ave id393904245?mt= cid:1  8">iTunes     Facebook  The following opens up your Friends in Facebook.     Facebook     Twitter  The following opens up a specific user in twitter.     Twitter     190    CHAPTER 11    INTEGRATING WITH NATIVE SERVICES      Putting It All Together   I would like to have a little augmented reality  AR  in the Grandview Avenue mobile site, but I don’t quite  have enough data to pull off a full-blown AR app and I can’t really interact with the Camera the way I’d  like to. However, I do have one idea: a hidden feature called an Easter Egg.   The Easter Egg   1.  You are on the home screen and standing in the parking lot of the Grandview   Avenue Carry Out on Third and Grandview Ave.  2.  You point your phone towards Grandview Café.  3.  The page will change to a panoramic photo of Grandview Avenue from the   corner of Third and Grandview Avenue.   The Technical Parts                   I need a few images to create my panoramic shot. Assuming I get a 30-degree view  per image, I need nine images for a complete 360-degree view. I then stitch these  together for a single JPG and make sure that when I connect the first and ninth  image they line up perfectly.   I need to use either CSS or Canvas to move the image based on the direction in  which the phone and camera are pointing  the “heading” .    I need to use the onorientationchange event to move my image and keep it in sync  with the heading of the camera.   To escape you can just use the “back” button.   The AR Code  In the following example I use the heading and tilt around the x-axis  beta  to move my image.   The first part of the code sets up the planner   with a background called pan1.jpg. This is the   image I created: a single panorama background image of 3,072 × 673 pixels. I set the initial background  positions to be 0% and 0%.   As part of the dynamic update of the CSS position I just normalize the headings and the tilt and then   reset the positions using percentages.          body {margin:0;}      panner {          height: 480px;          width: 320px;          background-size: 3072px 673px;          background-repeat: repeat-x;          background-position: 0% 0%;          background-image: url 'images pan1.jpg' ;      }          191    CHAPTER 11    INTEGRATING WITH NATIVE SERVICES      Next I need to create a few variables, one a global variable called heading that I can check on each   GPS location to find the direction in which the phone is pointing. The second, showEgg, is a Boolean that  decides whether to show the Easter Egg.   This is followed by the panImg function which changes the background position of the image as the   orientation changes.   The rest of the JavaScript checks for orientation and GPS location to fire the egg when the user is in   the correct position and pointing his phone towards Grandview Café.      var heading;  var showEgg = false;    function panImg x,y  {      var panElt = document.querySelector "panner" ;      panElt.style.backgroundPosition = x + "% " + y + "%";  }    window.ondeviceorientation = function e  {      heading = Math.round e.webkitCompassHeading ;      if  showEgg  {          var headingAsPercent =  heading 360  * 100;          var beta = Math.round e.beta ;          var betaAsPercent =  Math.abs 90-beta    30  * 100;          panImg headingAsPercent,betaAsPercent ;      }  }    function successGPS position  {      var lat = position.coords.latitude;      var lon = position.coords.longitude;      var isNearEgg = testDistance 39.98600278, -83.04510000, lat, lon ;      if  isNearEgg &  heading > 90 && heading < 180   {          showEgg = true;      }  }    function testDistance lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2  {      var lat = lat1 * 10 ^ 6 - lat2 * 10 ^ 6;    increased size to avoid rounding      var lon = lon1 * 10 ^ 6 - lon2 * 10 ^ 6;    increased size to avoid rounding      if   lat ^ 2 + lon ^ 2  ^ .5 < 100  {    close to area          return true;      }      return false;  }    function errorGPS   {     alert 'GPS Error' ;  }    function watchGPS   {      navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition successGPS, errorGPS, cid:1   {enableHighAccuracy : true} ;   192           setTimeout "watchGPS  ",30000 ;  }        CHAPTER 11    INTEGRATING WITH NATIVE SERVICES     Figure 11-1.

You can view source and get all the code or just cut and paste  what’s above, replacing your co-ordinates with those above. Or if you just want to view the Easter Egg,  you could hard-code the showEgg variable to always return true.   Chapter Summary   In this chapter I was able to show you how to use a few more native features of your iOS device to  capture and use the orientation and acceleration via JavaScript. I also showed you how to integrate with  external apps via URL Schemes.   193    CHAPTER 11    INTEGRATING WITH NATIVE SERVICES   Before moving on to the next chapter you should know how to do the following.      Use the ondeviceorientation event to detect the heading of your iOS device.     Use the ondevicemotion event to detect your iOS device moving through space.     Use a URL scheme to integrate with some native feature or native application on   your device.   Up until now we’ve done everything online and retrieved everything we need from the network. But   sometimes the network is not going to be available or not going to be as fast as we would like it, so  offloading some of the storage to the client might be a good idea, and that’s what I talk about next.         194    C H A P T E R  12               Offline Apps and Storage   There’s a variety of ways to speed up your application by cacheing certain amounts of data on the client.  Before HTML5 you could only store cookies or rely on the browser’s cacheing mechanism. Now you can  implement a variety of ways, by storing long-term data via the localStorage object, session data via the  sessionStorage object, or even an entire application via applicationCache. Depending on the kind of  application you are writing you may use none or all of these features.   The first mechanism I discuss is how to take your entire application offline, or in the case of no  network, a way to make your web app work entirely in offline mode. Some HTML5 books talk about  WebSQL, or the ability to access SQLite via JavaScript. I do not talk about Web SQL because this API is no  longer active. If you want to find out more about this API you can reference it at:  http:  www.w3.org TR webdatabase . Personally I found this a very complicated means for accessing  data on the client when compared to local and session storage options discussed later in the chapter.   The Cache Manifest   This is the name of the file you create when you want your application to be permanently cached or you  want it to run in offline mode. So just as with an HTML, CSS, or JS file, you  need to create a .manifest file  that you can place on your local system. Now this file can either be static or you can “fake” it by just  specifying a MIME type. This way your browser knows how to treat it. Your web server may or may not  have the MIME type installed. If it doesn’t, add this to your apache configuration.   AddType text cache-manifest .appcache   Remember, a manifest file is just plaintext as far as a text editor is concerned, nothing fancy. You  can cut and paste the contents from the companion site right into your own sample application with  minor modifications to file names and paths. Creating a manifest is really easy, just add the manifest  attribute to your   tag such as:  .   This file has three sections: CACHE, FALLBACK, and NETWORK.             The CACHE section is default and all the files under this section will be cached.   The FALLBACK section is a list of optional pages in case a resource is not available.   The NETWORK section is a whitelist of all files that require a network connection.     Note  The page where the manifest is specified is always cached regardless of the .manifest file.   195    CHAPTER 12    OFFLINE APPS AND STORAGE      A Manifest Example  Below I show you a number of example files that allow for local application cacheing. After you’ve  specified your manifest in your   tag you can use the information below to implement it yourself.  The next file is the manifest file, which is specified in the HTML tag of the document. This file tells   the browser which files to cache and is divided into sections.   chapter12.manifest   CACHE MANIFEST   v3 - 2011-11-25   This is a comment.    CACHE:   chapter12 index.php   chapter12 css ch12.css   chapter12 js ch12.js   chapter12 images akada-salon_thumb.jpg   chapter12 images grandview-cafe_thumb.jpg   chapter12 images jenis-ice-cream_thumb.jpg   chapter12 images the-candle-lab_thumb.jpg   chapter12 images the-grandview-theater_thumb.jpg   The problem with this is that in order to force your browser to get a new file, even if it’s a dynamic   page, you need to update your manifest file for each and every request. To do that I modified the  manifest to be a dynamically created PHP file. For this make sure to change the name of your dynamic  file, in my case chapter12.manifest.php. You can see that I’ve done this on the companion site example.  I’m still sending out the MIME type of text cache-manifest, and I’m immediately expiring the file by   setting the expires header to a date in the past; also I’m dynamically creating a comment in the file to  keep it different each and every time.    Now if the user is offline, the next time that a browser tries to access this manifest file the dynamic   update won’t retrieve an update,  and the content application will come exclusively from the cache.     Note  This is the same as the previous file, but I’m using PHP to set update the cache of the manifest file.   chapter12.manifest.php   <?  header "Cache-Control: max-age=0, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" ;  header "Pragma: no-cache" ;  header "Expires: Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT" ;   header 'Content-type: text cache-manifest' ;  ?>  CACHE MANIFEST  comment - date is    CACHE:   chapter12 index.php    chapter12 css ch12.css   chapter12 js ch12.js   chapter12 images akada-salon_thumb.jpg   chapter12 images grandview-cafe_thumb.jpg   chapter12 images jenis-ice-cream_thumb.jpg   196    UNCACHED = 0  IDLE = 1  CHECKING = 2  DOWNLOADING = 3  UPDATEREADY = 4  OBSOLETE = 5                                   Updates   Events                           CHAPTER 12    OFFLINE APPS AND STORAGE    chapter12 images the-candle-lab_thumb.jpg   chapter12 images the-grandview-theater_thumb.jpg   Application Cache  This is the actual DOM object you access programmatically via JavaScript. A brief overview of the API of  this object follows.   Update Statuses  read-only attribute status    update  :Tells browser to invoke application download process.  abort  : Tells browser to stop downloading and cancel updating cache.  swapCache  : Tells browser to check the manifest and swap accordingly.   onchecking: Browser is checking for an update.  onerror: Manifest error, or 404 of manifest file.  onnoupdate:Manifest has not changed.  ondownloading: Found an update and is downloading.  onprogress: Downloading files in manifest.  onupdateready: Files in manifest have been redownloaded.  oncached: All files downloaded and cached.  onobsolete: Manifest no longer exists so cache is being deleted.   An example of how to access and use this API follows. Here I am just setting up an event listener   to the event updateready, and then I prompt the user to see if he would like to load the new cache into  the page.

Figure 12-1. Application Cache View with Google Chrome      198    CHAPTER 12    OFFLINE APPS AND STORAGE   You use this if your application relies heavily on images or might be used frequently in a      nonnetworked mode.   Cookies   In addition to the application cache there are other ways to store information on the client. The oldest  way to do this is with cookies. Cookies allow you to store up to 2,048 bytes of data for a specific domain.  You can set these programmatically via your server side code or via JavaScript.   Companion Site Reference   Example 12-2: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter12 cookies.php   In the example below I set two cookies. Cookie A is going to be a session cookie. Cookie B is going to   be a semi-permanent cookie that expires in 30 days.    Set Cookie A    Set Cookie B          function setCookie name, value, expire_days  {          var expire = new Date  ;          expire.setDate expire.getDate   + expire_days ;          var value = escape value  +   expire_days == null  ? "" : "; expires=" + cid:1    expire.toUTCString   ;          document.cookie = name + "=" + value;      }      Figure 12-2 shows you these two cookies: one with an expiration date and another which is a session   cookie.   Figure 12-2. Cookies with Google Chrome      199    CHAPTER 12    OFFLINE APPS AND STORAGE   Local Storage   A better way of storing content on the client is with the localStorage object. Here instead of 2 k of  information we have up to 5 MB of data we’re allowed to store locally. Also we’re not limited to just  storing strings; we can store objects just as easily.             To put objects into local storage just use localStorage.setItem key,value .   To get objects from localStorage just use getItem key .   To remove objects from localStorage just use removeItem key .   In the example below I’m storing one string and one object, and on loading of that object, I’m   alerting it to the screen.   Companion Site Reference   Example 12-3: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter12 local.php    Set Local A    Set Local B          function TestObject   {          this.id = 1;          this.name = "test object";          this.description = "this is a test object i am going to put into local storage";      }       window.onload = function   {          alert localStorage.getItem 'test1'  ;      }      In Figure 12-3, I show the resource view of the localStorage object, where the key test2 is an object   and the key test1 is just a string.   Figure 12-3. Local Storage with Google Chrome   200    CHAPTER 12    OFFLINE APPS AND STORAGE      Session Storage   To store only items per session, just use sessionStorage instead of localStorage. The methods are the  same: setItem, getItem, removeItem, and the only difference is we store these per user session instead of  over multiple sessions.   In the example below I do the same thing, except this time if you close your browser and come back   you won’t be greeted by the alert message until you’ve set it from within the current session.   Companion Site Reference   Example 12-4: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter12 session.php    Set Session cid:1    A    Set Session cid:1    B          function TestObject   {          this.id = 1;          this.name = "test object";          this.description = "this is a test object i am going to put into local storage";      }        window.onload = function   {          alert sessionStorage.getItem 'test1'  ;      }      Likewise in Figure 12-4 I view session storage from the resources menu from within Google Chrome,   where key test2 is an object and test1 is just a string.   Figure 12-4. Session Storage with Google Chrome      201    CHAPTER 12    OFFLINE APPS AND STORAGE      Putting It All Together   Currently the Grandview Avenue app has relied exclusively on the network for everything and although  the Avenue is in a 3G 4G area it might be a good idea to cache some stuff locally for better performance.    The only really data-intensive part of the application comes at the beginning where I’m getting all   the profiles and associated data. So perhaps if I cache all the information for each of the business  profiles it would speed up rendering of each of the profile pages. This file is perhaps about 120 k but it  makes retrieval of the profile information near instantaneous versus a few seconds per profile.   To solve this problem I like to use sessionStorage over localStorage because the data update often   enough  daily  but not so often that I constantly need to check for updates and maintain synchronization.    Because I’m using jQuery, I just use the $  .ready   function to be consistent in usage versus   window.onload from some of the previous examples. Then it’s just a matter of checking for null to see if  the profile data have been loaded into memory.          var profileData;      if  sessionStorage.getItem 'profileData'  != null  {          profileData = sessionStorage.getItem 'profileData' ;      }        $  .ready function   {          if  sessionStorage.getItem 'profileData'  == null  {              $.getJSON 'api allprofiles.php', function data  {                  sessionStorage.setItem 'profileData' ,data ;              } ;          }      } ;        Note  I’m not able to use JSON in the Example Application because of jQuery Mobile. The framework is  problematic in its current version as it does not like to reapply styles to list from dynamically created elements.  Please note this is a work in progress and should a solution present itself after the publication of this book, I’ll  make sure to note it on the companion website.   Chapter Summary   In this chapter I showed you how to leverage some client-side storage to make your application perform  faster or even work while it’s offline. Before moving on to the next chapter you should know how to:      Create and use the manifest for taking applications offline.     Use the applicationCache object for managing your cached application.     Use localStorage for storing simple data or objects.     Use sessionStorage for storing simple data or objects.   Until now we’ve dived right into building our application and all of it was against my nature because   I’ve not written a single test for any of this code. However, I plan on fixing that in the next chapter by  talking about testing your mobile app. This covers topics such as unit testing with Jasmine and  simulating a slow network through the iOS simulator.   202    C H A P T E R  13               Mobile Testing   A few years back at a conference I heard this analogy between modern software engineers and civil  engineers. The story went something like this: suppose you were building a bridge that had never been  built before and you were using a new architecture on which the previous equations you used to solve  bridge problems did not apply. How would you know if the bridge could support the proposed weight?  One group of people began solving the problem by going about trying to refactor their equations to   solve the problem.   A second group of people solving the problem went about it slightly differently. They built a sample   of the bridge, and they loaded it until it broke. They repeated this over and over until they found the  capacity of the bridge.   In software we like to use the second way too; we like to test. These tests range from unit-testing   custom APIs to testing the performance of your web server and API. This testing provides valuable  insight into your application and you should not launch or even start building your application without  setting up your test.   Before writing this book I debated whether to make this the first chapter in the book because “test- driving code” has been a practice I use to make my code better and myself a better programmer. In this  chapter I talk about the following kinds of testing.   Performance testing with benchmarking, load testing, and simulating a mobile  network   But first I’d like to talk about a few terms: TDD, or test-driven development, and BDD, behavior-     Unit testing with Jasmine      Automated testing with Watir          A B testing   driven development.   Test-Driving Code   Long before the practice of TDD the practice of creating software went something like this.      Write some code.     Write some more code.         If you have time write a test for your code.   If it breaks fix it fast, and push it live.   203    CHAPTER 13    MOBILE TESTING      Developers didn’t write test because code usually worked or they used an excuse such as “they had  if statements” in the code to check for errors. Other reasons for not testing might be “testing would slow  me down” because it would often take less time to fix a bug than to write a comprehensive test for a  piece of code.   But what happens if you can’t have downtime? What happens if you need to refactor a lot of your   code and can’t afford to find out where it breaks because you can’t have downtime?   For these cases you write a test. The practice of writing test-first was introduced as test-driven   development.   TDD or Test-Driven Development  Test-driven development or TDD is the practice of:   1.  Write a test.  2.  Watch it fail.  3.  Fix your code so test will pass.  4.  Refactor your code.  5.  Repeat Step 1.   By writing your test first you truly understand the acceptance criteria or requirements of your   component or application. I use TDD in the example below.   Step 1  The first thing I write is a function assertString  . This takes two parameters: an expected value and an  actual value; it compares the two and returns a true if they are the equal.   Step 2  Next, I write a testHello function and drop it into the onload event.   The first time I run this it fails.   Step 3  Next, I write the hello function with nothing in it, and guess what, it fails again.   Finally, I write the hello function with a string parameter so that it returns hello followed by the   hello string plus the name variable passed in. Now when I run the test or refresh the page the test passes.  This is TDD.   Companion Site Reference   Example 13-1: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter13 tdd.php   204    CHAPTER 13    MOBILE TESTING            step 1      function assertString expected, actual  {          return  expected == actual ;      }       step 2      window.onload = function testHello   {          if  assertString "hello scott", hello "scott"    {              alert "hello works" ;          } else {              alert "hello fails" ;          }      }     step 3      function hello name  {          return "hello " + name;      }      Sometimes these tests are very developer-centric and their meaning can get lost in translation   translation to your business team . To compensate for this, a different type of semantics would be  needed to cross boundaries of developers, quality assurance, and business. Along came behavior-driven  development or BDD.   BDD or Behavior-Driven Development  Behavior-driven development or BDD is very close to TDD except the language and semantics normally  used in TDD are replaced with business- and user-centric terms that make sense to everyone on your  team, not just developers. An example of the previous “hello” example would look like this as a BDD  test case:  Given a user visits a page named "scott",  Then the user should be greeted with an alert called "hello scott".   In order to provide consistency a language was created for this called Gherkin. Gherkin is used in   Cucumber for Ruby, Lettuce for Python, Speclow for .NET, and behat for PHP. All of these are BDD unit- testing frameworks that allow for automated integration and unit testing.   Gherkin consists of the following.   Scenarios that are comprised of steps to test a feature.   Features that describe a single characteristic of a piece of software.               Givens are designed to put the system into a known state and are where your   Steps consisting of Givens, Whens, and Thens.   assumptions are created.      Whens describe key actions such as when I click a button or enter certain text.      Thens describe the outcomes or what to expect.   For more information on Gherkin, view its website at    https:  github.com cucumber cucumber wiki Gherkin   205    CHAPTER 13    MOBILE TESTING      In the previous example I wrote my own assertion and test but it provided no means to actually test   anything. So how do you get from a few English sentences in Gherkin to doing behavior-driven  development? Fortunately there is a JavaScript unit testing framework that provides both kinds of  assertions I want to use for my JavaScript unit test as well as BDD Gherkin interpreters that allow for real  unit tests and that’s called Jasmine.   Unit Testing with Jasmine  Jasmine is a BDD framework for testing JavaScript. You can download and read more about Jasmine at:  http:  pivotal.github.com jasmine . To install just unzip the files and follow the instructions below,  moving the files into the relevant directory for your project.   Companion Site Reference   Example 13-2: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter13 jasmine.php.    To get started I show you a simple example. First the basics: you need to include the jasmine.css,  jasmine.js, and jasmine-html.js files at the top of your test harness. A test harness is just a web page  where you can include the files you’re going to test.               Next I add my function  it’s the same hello   function as before .             the function part  your code       function hello name  {          return "hello " + name;      }      Now I write my spec, short for specification. This has three parts: describe, it, and expect.    The describe part is a way to group different specs together.    The it part is the specification.              The expect is short for expectations. This is for expressing what you expect from  the code.    In the code below we’re expecting the call to hello 'scott'  to return a string "hello scott".              the spec part      describe 'hello  ', function   {          it 'says hello', function   {              expect hello 'scott'  .toEqual "hello scott" ;          } ;   206    CHAPTER 13    MOBILE TESTING          } ;        As before in TDD, our first test should fail, so to implement it in Jasmine, we write some code to   execute our specification defined above. After running it we get the output shown in Figure 13-1.           jasmine.getEnv  .addReporter new jasmine.TrivialReporter   ;      jasmine.getEnv  .execute  ;      Figure 13-1. Showing failing test      Next I add the hello function and get a passing test, shown in Figure 13-2.   207    CHAPTER 13    MOBILE TESTING      Figure 13-2. Showing a passing test      Performance Testing   To use Jasmine with your mobile site, build a suite of test harnesses for all of your custom   JavaScript. We look at using Jasmine with Grandview Ave later, in “Putting It All Together.”   Performance testing or page performance testing is different from load testing in that it measures the  performance of the page load and JavaScript running on the client browser, not the speed at which your  web server can serve text, images, or other media.   Performance testing becomes important because your iOS device will run JavaScript a little to a lot   slower than the MacBook with which you’re developing your website. Before I talk about the test I  actually show you some results; they might surprise you.   First I create a few different kinds of test:   Simple Test: Counting a million times in a loop         Native JavaScript: DOM Traversal   208       CHAPTER 13    MOBILE TESTING       JQuery: DOM Traversal   Second, in Table 13-1 we compare them on the iPad v1, iPhone4, Chrome 15, and Safari 5.1.2. This   will give you relative feel for how they compare against one another.   Table 13-1. Performance Comparison  Test   iPad v1  ms    iPhone4  ms    Chrome v15  ms    Safari 5.1.2  ms    Simple   Native JS   jQuery 1.6.4   13   432   567   19   541   705   2   87   83   2   183   213   The Benchmark Object  Before taking benchmarks, I create a simple JavaScript object to calculate the time between two events,  start and stop. The benchmarking object will need to measure time in milliseconds. The following  example creates a benchmark object with properties startTime and endTime and has the methods, start,  stop, and get.   Companion Site Reference   Example 13-3: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter13 benchmark.php          function Benchmark   {          this.startTime = "";          this.endTime = "";          this.start = function   {              this.startTime = new Date  .getTime  ;          };          this.stop = function   {              this.endTime = new Date  .getTime  ;          };          this.get = function   {              return this.endTime - this.startTime;          };      }      Now I’ll talk about three separate performance tests: one is for a simple loop and the other two   compare native selectors and the jQuery selector as I iterate through and update the DOM.   209    CHAPTER 13    MOBILE TESTING   Simple Loop   This is a simple loop that counts 1 million times and does nothing else.       function test1   {          var foo = new Benchmark  ;          foo.start  ;          for  var i = 0; i < 1000000; i++  {             do nothing          }          foo.stop  ;          alert "1,000,000 loops take " + foo.get   + "ms." ;          location.reload  ;      }      DOM Traverse and Modify  The DOM traversal iterates through 10,000   elements. To set up the DOM Traversal test I create the  following HTML and 10,000   elements using PHP.   First I use the native querySelector to grab all classes then modify all the innerHTML of these   elements. I then alert the time and reload the page so as to avoid any browser caching.        Simple Test    Native Selector    jQuery Selector       " class="foo">           function test2   {          var foo = new Benchmark  ;          foo.start  ;          var divs = document.querySelectorAll ".foo" ;          for  var i = 0; i < divs.length; i++  {              var elt = divs[i].innerHTML = "foo"+i;          }          foo.stop  ;          alert "native selector time is " + foo.get   + "ms" ;          location.reload  ;      }      DOM Traverse and Modify w jQuery  This does the same thing as the previous example and makes use of the .each   function from within  jQuery.      function test3   {          var foo = new Benchmark  ;   210    CHAPTER 13    MOBILE TESTING              foo.start  ;          $ '.foo' .each function index, elt  {              elt.innerHTML = "foo"+index;          } ;            foo.stop  ;          alert "jquery selector time is " + foo.get   + "ms" ;          location.reload  ;      }      A Short Note on Network Throttling  One thing that it will be difficult to test your web app with will be to simulate 3G or slower speeds.   To get around this your Mac has the ipfw command, which is short for IP Firewall. To get your Mac   to slow down the speed at which it accesses a network resource, just open a terminal then enter the  following commands.   sudo ipfw pipe 1 config bw 4KBytes s  sudo ipfw add 1 pipe 1 src-port 80   To remove this restriction enter the following command.   To test this out I created the following large file  ~100 k . This can be any random file name; I used   sudo ipfw delete 1   large.php.   <?php  for  $i=0;$i<100000;$i++  {  echo 'a';  }  ?>   Using this file, try executing the following Ajax Request using jQuery. This test loads a large file via   AJAX  previous file called large.php  and measures the time between starting the download and  document.ready. It verifies that slower download speed when the firewall rules are in place.      function networkTest   {          var bench = new Benchmark  ;          bench.start  ;          $.ajax {              url: "large.php",              success: function   {                  bench.stop  ;                  alert "Time to download is:" + bench.get   ;              }          } ;      }      211    CHAPTER 13    MOBILE TESTING      A Short Note on Load Testing  Load testing is designed to measure the performance of your web server. I would recommend this kind  of testing if you have lots of HTTP requests or are expecting lots of traffic. Some shared hosting providers   mentioned in Chapter 1  will limit the number of HTTP requests per second to their servers to avoid  server crashes, and so on.   There are many tools for this kind of testing but the one we use is already installed on your Mac and   it’s called Apache Bench, or ab. So open a terminal and navigate to the Apache home bin.   Companion Site Reference   Example 13-4: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter13 network.php   A sample command looks like this:   ab -n 100 -c 10 http:  dev.learnhtml5book.com index.php   where –n represents the number of requests, –c represents the number of concurrent connections, and  the last parameter is a URL, in this case my development server for this book’s companion website.

If you are doing a lot of DOM manipulation and performance is a  concern you might want to build your own components using these functions as they are on average  30% faster and don’t require an additional download of the jQuery library.   Table 13-2.

Automated Testing   Testing your application over and over can be quite time consuming. Also as you modify your  application, even though you have a unit test you still want to have eyes on your application to know  that things are still working from end to end. There is a variety of products and tools out there that can  do this but the one I’m most fond of is a library created for the Ruby programming language called Watir   pronounced “water” .   Because Ruby is installed out of the box on your Mac there are just a few things you need to do to   automate testing through Safari.      Note  Although there are some native apps and third-party libraries that allow you to test through the iPhone,  I’ve found that I can do about 90% plus of my testing through my desktop browser.   sudo gem update—system  sudo gem install rb-appscript  sudo gem install safariwatir   213    CHAPTER 13    MOBILE TESTING      Second, you need a page to access and do something for my sample set-up. I use the companion site   and create a simple page with a button I can click. The HTML for this is below.   Companion Site Reference   Example 13-5: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter13 watir.php    Test Button      function test   {      alert "this is a test alert" ;  }        to run type from the command prompt: ruby script.rb  require 'rubygems'  require 'safariwatir'    browser = Watir::Safari.new  browser.goto "http:  dev.learnhtml5book.com"   browser.link :text, "Chapter 13 - Mobile Testing" .click  browser.link :text, "Watir" .click  browser.button :name, "test" .click   Finally, I create a simple test in Ruby that opens Safari, and navigates to this page, and clicks this   button:   That’s it. You can now automate until your heart’s content. To make things even better there’s a   package that allows you to integrate your BDD test mentioned earlier with your automated testing called  Cucumber.   You can find out more about Cucumber at: http:  cukes.info .      Other Testing Tools  This is not the only automated testing tool. There are others like Selenium and Windmill.  Just enter a Google search for “automated web testing,” browser plugins that will record your steps, or stand- alone proxy tools, but none I would recommend at this time just because I always use Watir.   A B Testing   The final kind of testing I discuss in this chapter is going to solve the problem of “What do you do when  you have two or more designs and you want to measure the conversion or click-through rate?” These  AB tests or experiments are often used on websites to measure whether a particular photo or placement  of a button gets users to buy something and increase the value of their purchase, or click through to  another page.   214       CHAPTER 13    MOBILE TESTING   For our AB test I show you how to use a simple cookie to show content dynamically for your mobile  page. First you need to decide what version you want to be represented as A  this is usually your existing  site , and what version you want for B  this is usually your test case .    Companion Site Reference   Example 13-6: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter13 abtest.php   In the example below I just use a CSS to hide both of the   tags.           .abtest {          display: none;      }      Usually this is the original version  Version A .    Usually this is the new version  Version B .    Next, you need a way to get and set cookies:          function getCookie name  {          var result = "";          var start = document.cookie.indexOf name + "=" ;          var end;          if  start != -1  {              start +=  name.length + 1 ;              end = document.cookie.indexOf ";", start ;              if  end == -1                   end = document.cookie.length;              result = unescape document.cookie.substring start, end  ;          }          return result;      }        function setCookie name, value, expire_days  {          var expire = new Date  ;          expire.setDate expire.getDate   + expire_days ;          var value = escape value  +   expire_days == null  ? "" : "; expires=" + cid:1    expire.toUTCString   ;          document.cookie = name + "=" + value;      }      Then you need a way to set a random cookie and then, based on this random cookie, pick which   version to show:      var random = Math.floor Math.random   * 100  + 1;   215    CHAPTER 13    MOBILE TESTING          var abcookie = getCookie "abtest" ;      if  abcookie == ""  {             if greater than 50 set to version 'a' otherwise 'b'           random > 50  ? setCookie "abtest", "a", 30  : setCookie "abtest", "b", 30 ;      }      if  abcookie == "a"  {          document.querySelector "a" .style.display = 'inline';      } else {          document.querySelector "b" .style.display = 'inline';      }      If you don’t want to roll your own, Google even has a tool for this called Website Optimizer, which   you can find out more about at: http:  www.google.com websiteoptimizer.    In addition, you can set these in Google Analytics via custom attributes or append them to your   Apache logs so you can get a good measure of performance of each of these cookies as they relate to your  site. You can’t do that with local storage.   Putting It All Together   I use a lot of GPS in the Grandview Avenue app. One of the common functions I use is to validate GPS  coordinates. So I write a GPS validation function for the area in which my app will be active.   First, Create the Test Harness  This is the HTML that will run your test. It contains the Jasmine zip files you downloaded earlier as well  as the spec JavaScript file of your new code and the library you’ve written.   <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional  EN"          "http:  www.w3.org TR html4 loose.dtd">             Jasmine Test Runner                                                                jasmine.getEnv  .addReporter new jasmine.TrivialReporter   ;      jasmine.getEnv  .execute  ;            After you’ve created this file it does not do much so now we need to write our specification.  You do   this first in TDD.    216    CHAPTER 13    MOBILE TESTING      Second, Create the SPEC   The spec first verifies invalid co-ordinates. Second, it verifies good co-ordinates.   describe 'getCurrentPosition  ', function   {      it 'test for invalid coordinates', function   {          expect validateGPS 0, 0  .toBeFalsy  ;          expect validateGPS 39, 83  .toBeFalsy  ;          expect validateGPS 39, -99  .toBeFalsy  ;          expect validateGPS -100, 100  .toBeFalsy  ;      } ;        it 'returns a set of VALID coordinates', function   {          expect validateGPS 39, -83  .toBeTruthy  ;      } ;  } ;   Because we have a failing test, we can write the implementation.   Third, Create the Validation Function  The validator just checks for valid latitude  lat  and longitude  lon . I want to return only a certain grid so  in this case I just choose a few co-ordinates for latitude  38 and 41  and longitude  –82 and –84  and  validate against those.   function validateGPS lat,lon  {      if  lat == 0  lon == 0  return false;      if  lat   41   return false;      if  lon > -82  lon < -84   return false;      if  !isNaN lat  && !isNaN lon   return true;      return false;  }   Now that you’ve been able to see a passing test, you’re good to go. Just remember as you write your   custom classes and functions in your JavaScript code you create good test coverage. This way if  something changes you can catch yourself.   Chapter Summary   In this chapter I talked about a number of ways to test your mobile web application.          TDD and BDD test for unit testing your custom JavaScript   Performance and load testing to gain a better idea of your application’s  responsiveness even with simulated slower network speeds      Means to automate testing and optimize your web app’s content   Although this chapter on testing is at the end of the book I highly recommend you think about   testing every step of the way. It will make you a better developer and ensure the quality of your code is at  its best.   The next chapter is a catch-all chapter, talking about things such as web workers  threads for   JavaScript  and web sockets and a lot more things you didn’t think you could do with plain old  JavaScript.   217    C H A P T E R  14               Advanced Topics   This chapter is pretty much a catch-all for the HTML5 APIs I didn’t talk about in much detail in Chapter  2  HTML5 in short . It touches on some useful technology, but perhaps not technology you’ll use in the  first version of your mobile web app.   The heart of this chapter is about the communications API of HTML5 with topics including cross-  domain communication, server-sent events, and web sockets. This gives you the ability to send and  receive messages within your web app without the constant polling that’s typically used via  setInterval   or setTimeout  .   I then talk about multithreading via web workers and the additional management of your history   object with some new methods and events.   Cross-Domain Communication   Before HTML5, it was difficult to get a browser to communicate between DOMs on different source  URLs, specifically different domains, because of something called the same origin policy.   The same origin policy was introduced as a security feature as a part of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in   March of 1996. The basic concept ensured that only scripts running on pages from within the same  domain were allowed to access the objects, methods, and properties of other pages within the same  domain. This created a number of problems for web developers trying to add features and create mash- ups, but it was also a good thing because of security. To get around the same origin policy, HTML5  added a document messaging API. Yes, it really did take about 15 years to create a workaround.    Let’s start by looking at the options that were open to developers before HTML5.   Before HTML5  Let’s say your page is http:  www.learnhtml5book.com index.php. How would the URLs in Table 14-1  react to the same origin policy?   Table 14-1. Same Origin Policy Overview   URL   http:  www.learnhtml5book.com index2.php   Same site, same domain   https:  www.learnhtml5book.com index2.php   Different protocol   Reason   Success   Success   Failure   219    CHAPTER 14    ADVANCED TOPICS      URL   http:  www.learnhtml5book.com:8080 page2   http:  www2.learnhtml5book.com index.php   http:  www.grandviewave.com index.php   Success   Failure   Failure   Failure   Reason   Different port   Different subdomain   Different domain   Although the same origin policy proved inconvenient for web developers trying to create something,   it prevented predatory sites from grabbing DOM objects such as your Amazon session cookie and  ordering a bunch of things on your account or grabbing other personal information.    Before document messaging, there were three main ways to get around this:             Subdomains via document.domain   Proxy request via a server-side language   Including third-party scripts   Let’s talk about subdomains first.   document.domain  On both the origin domain and the alternate domain, set the document.domain property on each of these  pages. This allows both DOMs to share data.   document.domain = "learnhtml5book.com";   Using a Proxy  If your site is on another hosted server you can create a proxy to these data by requesting them via a  server-side call from your own domain. Here’s a sample proxy used to access remote resources using PHP.   <?php  $url = "http:  www.grandviewave.com api remote.php";  $remote_page = file_get_contents $url.'&auth_token= cid:1   d0803e5ec8aee58801c548c1c0356a94f4dd4c73' ;  echo $remote_page;  ?>   This page will take the URL specified via the $url variable and output it on your page. So if the   page above was http:  yourdomain.com proxy.php, the actual HTML displayed would be that of the  specified URL.   I’ve used this method when accessing JSON from third-party sites. It also allows me to cache it,   which improves my page’s latency  time to load .   Including Scripts from Other Domains  A lot of third-party APIs rely on allowing third-party script access by including remote scripts on the  origin domain. The example below is the way Google collects analytics information.   220    CHAPTER 14    ADVANCED TOPICS        var _gaq = _gaq  [];    _gaq.push ['_setAccount', 'UA-aaaaaaa-x'] ;    _gaq.push ['_trackPageview'] ;      function   {      var ga = document.createElement 'script' ; ga.type = 'text javascript'; cid:1    ga.async = true;      ga.src =  'https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https:  ssl' : 'http:  www'  + cid:1    '.google-analytics.com ga.js';      var s = document.getElementsByTagName 'script' [0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore ga, cid:1    s ;    }   ;        Note  Because PhoneGap uses local files and the file:   protocol, it’s not subject to the same origin policy. Read  more about this in Chapter 15.   So to get around having to hack your way to a useful web application, HTML5 added the cross-  document messaging API.   Document Messaging  The document messaging API has the following method.   window.postMessage message    The receiver of the message just needs to have an event listener called:   window.onmessage event    Companion Site Reference   Example 14-1: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter14 messaging.php   One way to implement this is to use an   to include the contents of a remote DOM. For this   example I create a simple HTML file on my domain called  http:  www.scottpreston.com messagetest.html. When this page’s onmessage event fires I alert the  contents of the message via the event.data property.    This &lt;iframe&gt; is from scottpreston.com.    Send message!       221    CHAPTER 14    ADVANCED TOPICS          window.onmessage = function e  {          if  e.origin == "http:  dev.learnhtml5book.com"  e.origin == cid:1    "http:  www.learnhtml5book.com"  {              alert e.data ;          }      };      Next on the origin domain’s source file I have a  ,   and a button to initialize the   event. In the postMessage method, I send the contents of the   along with the domain to which  I want to post the message. After clicking the button I get an alert pop-up, executed from the remote  domain. I could even read cookies or anything if I decide to put that logic inside the onmessage function.        Send    <iframe src="http:  www.scottpreston.com messagetest.html" height="100" width="300" cid:1    id="remote_win">          function send   {          var win = document.querySelector "remote_win" .contentWindow;          var elt = document.querySelector "msg_txt" ;          win.postMessage                   elt.value, "http:  www.scottpreston.com"           ;          elt.value = ";      }      You can use any of these methods to assist in cross-domain messaging or to improve performance,  which I’ve done with a proxy. The onmessage event is used throughout this chapter including something  really powerful: server-sent events.    Server-Sent Events   The first kinds of communication we covered in this chapter were from browser to browser across  different domains. The second kind of messages I talk about are server-sent events.    These events occur directly from server to browser  client . Previous to this specification a   JavaScript would need to poll a server on some interval creating a lot of overhead and unneeded traffic.  So rather than polling every one or two seconds for an update you can just open a connection and then  when something updates you can send an event.   To implement this you first need some server-side code that sends an event-stream. This example   just sends the time  $time variable  every five seconds. See Figure 14-1.   <?php  header 'Content-Type: text event-stream' ;  header 'Cache-Control: no-cache' ;  while  true  {      $time = time  ;      echo "data: ". $time . PHP_EOL;      echo PHP_EOL;      ob_flush  ;      flush  ;   222    CHAPTER 14    ADVANCED TOPICS          sleep 5 ;    wait 5 seconds  }  ?>   Next, you need to open a connection in the client to the server and a way to update the page   contents. Again, just as with document messaging, we use the onmessage event.

You can program this to poll a   database or use whatever interval you want.   223    CHAPTER 14    ADVANCED TOPICS         Figure 14-1. Server-Side Events   Web Sockets   Another kind of communication between a server and a browser is a web socket, which is a bidirectional  protocol that travels over a TCP socket. It’s not HTTP, but an entirely different socket-based protocol.  This means you can’t use Apache to send out data without a custom module or proxy to another server.   If you are looking for a way to implement a chat program or other real-time application where   you’re constantly sending and receiving data from a server or other users, you might use web sockets  over traditional http web programming.   For a list of server implementations see the following.   http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Comparison_of_WebSocket_implementations   Now even though I’m not going to implement a server solution here I’d like to invoke a current web   socket at WebSocket.org. Here just like the other message implementations we write an event handler  called onmessage, to take care of the response.   224       CHAPTER 14    ADVANCED TOPICS   To send a message to the web socket, we simply call the method send with our message as the   payload. Additional event handlers  not shown  for a WebSocket include, onopen, onerror, and onclose.

You do this because often times you will  want to do things in the background without wanting to interfere with your user interface.   However, because of thread safety, workers do not have access to:                 The DOM   window object   document object   navigator object   However, a worker can still access the following.   225    CHAPTER 14    ADVANCED TOPICS                   location object   XMLHttpRequest   applicationCache   setTimeout clearTimeout, setInterval clearInterval functions   To use a web worker it’s as simple as creating a new Worker   object with the source of the   JavaScript in the constructor. Then as with the other communication functions mentioned previously,  just add an onmessage event to capture data returned from the worker. But to send data to the worker we  use the postMessage method. The example below sends nothing.   In the worker.js file the role of this function is to loop in a one-second interval and post information   back to the original source file; then after five seconds stop.

History Management   Before HTML5 the only way you could access the history would be to set a timer and monitor the  location.hash property. This constant polling consumes valuable CPU cycles and can be problematic.  The preferred method would be to have an event fire when it changes.   The example below sets a timeout and changes the document.location to change every two seconds;   then based on the firing of the event onhashchange, I change the innerHTML of a   element.   Companion Site Reference   Example 14-5: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter14 history.php    Web Socket Test    This is some content...      var counter = 0;  function changeHash   {      document.location = "history.php"+counter;      if  counter < 5  setTimeout "changeHash  ",2000 ;      counter++;  }    window.onhashchange = function   {      var elt = document.querySelector "something" ;      if  counter == 2  {          elt.innerHTML = "This us something else completely...";      }        if  counter == 4  {          elt.innerHTML = "Yet, something else you might want to read...";      }  }      Other things you can do with this include:          history.length: This returns the number of items in the session history.   history.state: This returns the current state of the history object.   227    CHAPTER 14    ADVANCED TOPICS                     history.go n : This allows you to go in any positive or negative direction in this  history.   history.back  : This goes back one in the history  like the back button .   history.forward  : This goes forward one in the history  like the forward button .   history.pushState state, title, url : This allows you to set a state into the  browser’s history.   history.replaceState state, title, url : This allows you to replace a state in  the browser’s history by the URL.     Note  The state object is just any object you want to put into the history. This object can be any object you  want that is bound to the DOM at the point in history where you happen to be.   Chapter Summary   This chapter was a catch-all chapter that included some details on messaging.   This messaging ranged from how to get around the same origin policy in JavaScript by using the   window.postMessage method and window.onmessage event listener.   But we later found out that the onmessage event listener could also be applied to the EventSource for  web workers for multithreading and for server-side events and web sockets for allowing realtime server- to-browser communication without the need for polling.   If you’re implementing some rather intensive background task or are looking to speed up the   rendering of your interface, then consider using web workers to perform some of these tasks.   If you want to have direct server-to-browser communication such as with a chat client or maybe an   interactive GPS-related app, maybe you can use server-side events or web sockets.   This concludes just about everything you can think of doing with Mobile Safari and JavaScript and  HTML5. But there’s still more to do and that’s to take all you’ve learned and turn it into a Native App via  PhoneGap, and that’s what we talk about next.               228    C H A P T E R  15               Going Native with PhoneGap   You can do a lot with Mobile Safari, but there’s always room for improvement. In particular you might  want native controls or even want to take video or photos using your camera, but you can’t do that with  Mobile Safari. Enter PhoneGap.   PhoneGap was created at an iPhoneDevCamp in San Francisco in 2005.  I started using PhoneGap a few years ago and was amazed at how by just using JavaScript I could   access all the basic functions I needed without knowing Objective-C. Basically PhoneGap renders your  app using what’s called a UIWebView. This allows a native app to basically render local HTML, CSS, and  JavaScript files in a window using Mobile Safari while allowing access to all the native functions you  can’t normally access.   Because you’re going to create a native app you’ll need Xcode. You might find it a larger learning   curve to understand Xcode  Apple’s Integrated Development Environment  than to understand  PhoneGap. Once you build your first app you will be amazed at how simple it is!   For this chapter you probably won’t need your trusty browser or the companion site  unless you just  want to download the sample app . In fact it might be helpful to download it at the beginning so you can  follow along, but first you need to install Xcode and PhoneGap.   Installing PhoneGap   To start using PhoneGap you need an Intel-based Mac with OSX 10.6 or greater.    Next you need to install Xcode from the Apple Developer Portal: http:  developer.apple.com.   Third you need to download and install PhoneGap from http:  phonegap.com. This is a .zip file you  need to open. After you download the file navigate to iOS and double click the .dmg. You should see the  installer shown in Figure 15-1.   229    CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP      230   Figure 15-1. Installing the .dmg   Once you install the disk image you are ready to start with your first PhoneGap application. So just   open Xcode then select a PhoneGap-based application  see Figure 15-2 .       Figure 15-2. Phone Gap Project Type   After your project opens just click run and you should see your PhoneGap application open an  iPhone simulator with an alert message. The output just displays a simple alert letting you know the  event fired  Figure 15-3 .   CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP   231    CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP      Figure 15-3. Plumbing Test App        Note  I had a problem the first time running. It said it could not find the folder www. To fix this make sure you  run PhoneGap at least once and it builds. Then import this project into PhoneGap and ensure you select Copy files.   If you look at the source code for your first app you will see there’s not much to it, just some   formatting for the viewport in the   tag and a custom event listener called "deviceready". That’s it.                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale= cid:1   1.0, user-scalable=no;"  >   232       CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP   meta charset="utf-8">  script type="text javascript" charset="utf-8" src="phonegap-1.2.0.js">          function onBodyLoad  {          document.addEventListener "deviceready", onDeviceReady, false ;      }      function onDeviceReady   {          navigator.notification.alert "PhoneGap is working"       }            Phone Gap Test        Take some time to look around and experiment with your app.   Enhancing Your App   Next you want to enhance your PhoneGap app to do some of the things your mobile app can do and  some of the things it can’t do, such as access your phone’s camera.     Note  You might want to target your iPhone or iPad device when you try these as the simulator might give   you errors.   Geolocation  PhoneGap uses the same objects as Mobile Safari; there’s no need to change any syntax as PhoneGap  just overrides these functions to call native code.   function testGeo         {  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition geoSuccess, allError ;  }    function geoSuccess position  {      alert 'Latitude: ' + position.coords.latitude + '\n' +                'Longitude: ' + position.coords.longitude + '\n' +                'Altitude: ' + position.coords.altitude + '\n' +                'Accuracy: ' + position.coords.accuracy + '\n' +                'Altitude Accuracy: ' + position.coords.altitudeAccuracy + '\n' +                'Heading: ' + position.coords.heading + '\n' +                'Speed: ' + position.coords.speed + '\n' +                'Timestamp: ' + new Date position.timestamp  + '\n' ;      }   233    CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP      Accelerometer  Again as with geolocation you can either use built-in Safari functions discussed in Chapter 11 or you can  use the PhoneGap object. Here are the two examples side by side.     mobile web  window.ondevicemotion = function evt  {      accelSuccess evt.acceleration ;  };       phonegap  function testAccel   {          navigator.accelerometer.getCurrentAcceleration accelSuccess, allError ;  }    function accelSuccess acceleration  {          alert 'Acceleration X: ' + acceleration.x + '\n' +                'Acceleration Y: ' + acceleration.y + '\n' +                'Acceleration Z: ' + acceleration.z + '\n' +                'Timestamp: '      + acceleration.timestamp + '\n' ;  }   Vibrate or Beep  Making the phone vibrate is something you can’t do in Mobile Safari. You can also make your phone beep.   function vibrate   {       navigator.notification.vibrate 2000 ;   milliseconds      navigator.notification.beep 2 ;    numbr of times  }   You can use this to notify a user when a message arrives, for feedback during a game, or maybe even   to provide an audio cue to do something else.   Using the Camera  So finally you can access your camera using JavaScript. Just call the getPicture method and you can  return data in a Base64 encoded string for rendering in the UIWebView of PhoneGap.   function testCamera   {      clearPhoto  ;      navigator.camera.getPicture camSuccess, allError, { quality: 50 } ;   }    function camSuccess imageData  {     var image = document.querySelector 'myImage' ;      image.src = "data:image jpeg;base64," + imageData;  }    function clearPhoto   {      var image = document.querySelector 'myImage' ;      image.src = "";  }   234       CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP   There are a few things you can do with a camera in your application. Although designing a photo- editing application might be a little bit heavy in terms of processing, you could do it with some of the  examples from Chapter 9, “Canvas.”   Augmented reality apps might also be a little heavy in terms of processing but you could create a   game where you tag locations of various things and upload them to a server for further processing.   Or how about interacting with the camera to augment an existing content management system?   Imagine taking pictures for your blog or CMS right from the same device on which you’re entering your  text? That could be your next app!   PhoneGap API Overview   The PhoneGap API is the complete API that’s installed by default after you install PhoneGap. So out of  the box you can do quite a bit, all with a little JavaScript.    I go over a short summary of the API below along with some methods and properties of these   objects as this could give you a taste of what’s possible with a little JavaScript and a powerful native  library  PhoneGap .   Accelerometer  This allows you to capture motion in the x-, y-, and z-directions. You can use the accelerometer object  with PhoneGap or use native Safari.   accelerometer.getCurrentAcceleration   accelerometer.watchAcceleration   accelerometer.clearWatch   Camera  This object gives you the ability to interact with your phone’s camera. There are options to save your  photo to your photo library, or an album. The image is returned as a Base64 encoded string, however,  you can still save locally and then use a method to return a string of the file’s location for future  processing.   To implement just pass a few functions and a set of options to the method.   camera.getPicture    Capture  These give you the ability to capture audio, images, and video from your device.   capture.captureAudio   capture.captureImage   capture.captureVideo   MediaFile.getFormatData   Compass  These allow you to capture compass-related data via the PhoneGap object versus native.   compass.getCurrentHeading                                  235    CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP      compass.watchHeading   compass.clearWatch   compass.watchHeadingFilter   compass.clearWatchFilter   connection.type   Contacts  These provide access to the contacts database.   contacts.create   contacts.find   Connection  This is a property that allows you to test the connection type: either WiFi, 2G, 3G, 4G, or NONE.   Device  This gives you the ability to read information on the device such as name, platform, UUID, and version,  among others.   Events  These give you the ability to interact with other parts of the device.                                                                          deviceready   pause   resume   online   offline   backbutton   batterycritical   batterylow   batterystatus   menubutton   searchbutton   startcallbutton   endcallbutton   volumedownbutton   volumeupbutton   236       File Objects  These give you the ability to interact with the device file system.   CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP                                                                                       DirectoryEntry   DirectoryReader   File   FileEntry   FileError   FileReader   FileSystem   FileTransfer   FileTransferError   FileUploadOptions   FileUploadResult   FileWriter   Flags   LocalFileSystem   Metadata   media.getCurrentPosition   media.getDuration   media.play   media.pause   media.release   media.seekTo   media.startRecord   media.stopRecord   media.stop   Geolocation  These give access to the GPS on your device.   geolocation.getCurrentPosition   geolocation.watchPosition   geolocation.clearWatch   Media  These give the ability to record or play back media on the device.   237    CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP                   notification.alert   notification.confirm   notification.beep   notification.vibrate       openDatabase   Plugins   Notification  These give you the ability to access the native notification mechanism, specifically beep and vibrate.   Storage  This function utilizes WebSQL databases. I’ve not talked about these databases as they are deprecated  and are no longer active.   Outside of the standard APIs discussed above there are a number of third-party plugins to PhoneGap.  These plugins give you the ability to do much more, such as iAds, NativeControls, or Google Analytics.   For a complete list of plugins please visit GitHub:   https:  github.com phonegap phonegap-plugins   A Plugin Example—NativeControls  One of the features you might want to add to your PhoneGap app is native controls for features such as  tabbed navigation. This involves downloading the control from the plugin site and placing the .h and .m  files in the Plugins folder in Xcode, and the .js file in your  www directory.   You also need to ensure that you update your PhoneGap.plist  Figure 15-4  because this tells your   project to which plugins it has access. I added a NativeControls key-value pair.   238       CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP   Figure 15-4. PhoneGap.plist      After adding this all you need to do is clean and build from the Product Menu in Xcode. Just be sure   to include your NativeControls.js file like so:            Your directory structure might look something like Figure 15.5 with your NativeControls.h and   NativeControls.m files in the Plugins directory and your JavaScript file in  www js.   239    CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP      Figure 15-5. X-Code Project Structure        Note  Create your  www directory just as you would your mobile directory; put your CSS, images, and js files in  separate folders for better organization.   To access the functionality of the native controls you just need to call the methods on the   NativeControls object you’ve added.   I create a global variable called nativeControls so I can access and update this object later; then   inside loadTabs   I create the tab bar, then start creating the tabs one by one. Finally, I set the location  and order of the tabs as well as the default-selected tab.   240    CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP     Note  Don’t be confused by the case of the object name; it can be anything you want.   var nativeControls;  function loadTabs   {    nativeControls = new NativeControls  ;    nativeControls.createTabBar  ;     nativeControls.createTabBarItem "tab1","The Ave", "www images city.png", cid:1    {onSelect : function   {}} ;     nativeControls.createTabBarItem "tab2","Near Me", "www images location.png", cid:1    {onSelect : function        {}} ;     nativeControls.createTabBarItem "tab3","Specials", "www images tag.png", cid:1    {onSelect : function   {}} ;     nativeControls.createTabBarItem "tab4","Parking", "www images parking.png", cid:1    {onSelect : function        {}} ;     nativeControls.createTabBarItem "tab5","More", "tabButton:More", {onSelect : cid:1    function   {}} ;     nativeControls.showTabBar "bottom" ;    nativeControls.showTabBarItems "tab1","tab2","tab3","tab4", "tab5" ;    nativeControls.selectTabBarItem "tab1" ;  }   After you compile and build you see the native controls at the bottom of your screen  see Figure 15-6 .   241    CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP               242   Figure 15-6.

Mobile Web App Versus Native App    So far we’ve talked about some of the ways PhoneGap can help you enhance your app, and we’ve seen  some more of PhoneGap’s features in overview. To put all this in context and to sum up why you should  take this final step with your app, I’ve put a little chart together in Table 15-1 to compare and contrast  the mobile web, PhoneGap, and Native apps.     CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP   PhoneGap   Yes   Yes   Better   HTML5   Limited   Yes   Native   Yes   Yes   Best   Full    Yes   Yes   Full 3D GL   Accelerometer, Gyroscope,  Compass, GPS   Accelerometer, Gyroscope,  Compass, GPS, Camera         Table 15-1. App Comparison   Mobile Web   Network Access   Yes   Display Web Content   Yes   Performance   Graphics   Hardware Access   Good   HTML5   Native Controls   File   No   No   Putting It All Together   One last time, let’s see what happens when we put it all together.   We already have a mobile site, but now it’s time to take everything we’ve done and adapt it to a Native  App. The first thing we do is add a splash screen.   In Xcode there is a Resources directory off the main project folder, and two subfolders: icons and  splash. Your icons will be 57  cid:1  57 pixels and 114  cid:1  114 pixels for the icon@2x.png file, and your splash  screens will be 480  cid:1  320 and 960  cid:1  640 for the Default@2x.png. By just overwriting the default files then  cleaning and rebuilding your app, you will get your icon and splash screen set.   243    CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP      Figure 15-7. Grandview Avenue Mobile App Splash      This splash  Figure 15-7  will show for a few seconds then it will take you to your home page    index.html .   The Home Page  The page that’s loaded after the splash will be index.html.   This page is just an HTML page using jQuery Mobile mainly for the effects and styling. The sequence   of loading is the CSS, followed by PhoneGap libraries, PhoneGap plugins, jQuery core, and Mobile,  followed by application-specific code in grandviewave.js.   Next up is some standard jQuery mobile mark-up.                     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, cid:1    244       CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP    maximum-scale=1.0, user-      scalable=no;"  >                                <script type="text javascript" charset="utf-8" src="js jquery cid:1   .mobile-1.0.min.js">                                                                Business Directory                            Note  I’ve also not included every data-role="page" in the code above but the application will have one of  these for each of the pages screens the user will visit.   You can see from the screen capture of the home page in Figure 15-8 that it’s very close to the mobile   site, but rather than using the jQuery Mobile tabs, I have native looking tabs at the bottom of the app.   245    CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP      Figure 15-8. Grandview Avenue—Start Screen      In order to access the data from www.grandviewave.com, I just use AJAX to load the content into page   elements, some of which I preload and cache in sessionStorage when the app starts up.   To see how I preload all the content from my API I have the following function I call onLoad  .  The base_url is my API URL consisting of http:  sitename directory . And because I can update   the content on my server dynamically, I don’t need to publish a new app each time I want to update the  database.   function loadPages   {    $.get base_url + 'cats.php', function data  {    sessionStorage.put "category_data",data ;      $ "cats" .html data ;    } ;    $.get base_url + 'specials.php', function data  {    sessionStorage.put "special_data",data ;      $ 'specials_info' .html data ;    } ;  }   246    CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP      specials tab.    Finally to make my navigation a little more native I use the custom controls such as this for my   nativeControls.createTabBarItem "tab3","Specials", "www images tag.png", {    onSelect : function   {      $.mobile.changePage "specials", "pop" ;    }  } ;   This would cause the tab to change the page to specials  a hidden   with an id="specials"    via the pop transition.   Publishing to the App Store   There are several steps you need to follow to publish an app to the App Store. On a high level, you need  to do the following.    1.  Create a developer account.  2.  Create a certificate signing request .  3.  Download a certificate.  4.  Create a provisioning profile  developer and for distribution on App Store .  5.  Add an AppID  this links your binary file via Info.plist of your app with your   provisioning profile at Apple.   6.  Build your app for distribution.  7.  Submit your app as a Zip file via iTunesConnect.  8.  Wait for approval  up to a week .   For more information on publishing to the App Store please follow the detailed information on the   Apple Developer website. There’s a lot of information there and there are many steps to follow.    https:  developer.apple.com ios manage distribution index.action   If you don’t want to submit via the App Store and would rather just install your app to a handful of   devices you just need to create a developer provisioning profile.   Also, when submitting to the App Store it’s important to keep in mind performance and iOS human   interface guidelines. I’ve personally not had any issues using jQuery mobile and PhoneGap, but please  take some time to review this link:   https:  developer.apple.com appstore guidelines.html   You should also take some screenshots of your app so you can submit it to the App Store. If your app   is a paid app make sure you have the proper banking and financial steps in place; if it’s free you can just  submit the app with nothing to worry about financially.   Finally when submitting your app, be sure to include links to your website and make sure you have   a way for users to contact you in case of any bugs or if they have any questions.   Once your app goes live, make sure to send a link to all your friends so they can download the app   and give it a high rating. This will ensure others will try it out!   247    CHAPTER 15    GOING NATIVE WITH PHONEGAP   Chapter Summary   In this chapter we installed PhoneGap and used it to convert our mobile app to a native app. This allows  us to make use of native controls for a snappier response to user input and better aesthetics.    This concludes all of the work of building a Mobile Web application or iOS app. As you can see there   are many differences between the apps discussed in this and previous chapters and a traditional web  application, but there’s also a lot of overlap. Some parting advice I’d give to anyone creating something:   “Ship First, Refine Second.”   So many times developers “gold-plate”: they get to a point where they think something is done and   they are ready to ship, then a little doubt creeps in and they add a little bit more, then a little bit more,  and then a little bit more. You will have plenty of time to perfect your craft and enhance your product.  Don’t try to be perfect with version 1.

                                      xvii    About the Author     Scott Preston is a software craftsman from Columbus, Ohio. Over the past  decade he has worked for some of the largest companies in the world and worked  on lots of web and mobile sites. When he’s not speaking at conferences, working  on a new web or mobile project, or writing, he’s busy solving hard problems for  his customers at his company CodeGin LLC, which he founded in 2010. You can  find out more about Scott on his blog http:  www.scottpreston.com or follow  him on twitter @scottpreston.   xix         PREFACE   About the Technical Reviewer      Peter Whitmore is a software engineer with over fifteen years in the business.  His experience has mostly been gained through his years with several  manufacturing industry leaders. His development skills range from writing  server side applications using Java to creating front end web applications written  using frameworks and technologies such as spring, JSF, JSR 286 Portlets, dojo,  jquery and standard JavaScript. Peter is also a registered Apple Developer for the  iOS Developer Program.   Peter gained his Master of Science in software engineering at the University of  Liverpool and currently manages a team of developers. He is married with two  grown children and enjoys riding his bike, taking in the fresh air, listening to  music, reading books and watching good dramas on television.             xx       Preface   This book is designed to be used in conjunction with two sites. The first includes live working examples  to accompany every chapter, and the second is a real world application that uses nearly every HTML5 or  JavaScript feature discussed in the book, so you can see how it looks and works in practice.   The Companion Site   www.learnhtml5book.com   This site features a series of examples for every chapter. Look at the site on your desktop, iPad or iPhone  as you read the book. Click “View Source” in your browser or go to the Apress download zip to see the  source code for each e×ample.   Whenever a companion site e×ample is available, you will see a note that looks like this.   Companion Site Reference    Example 4-2: Follow the link below to run this example on the companion site.    http:  www.learnhtml5book.com chapter4 objects.php   You can navigate straight to the actual example on the companion site, view the source or “Save As”   to see exactly what I’m talking about in real time.   If you have an eBook reader, you can click on the example link and go directly to the example on the   companion site.   What you see in the book might only be part of the code needed to demonstrate an idea or concept,  but the companion site has everything you need, like additional JS, or CSS, or rendered HTML. I also use  a bit of PHP to glue together the HTML on the site, but you don't need to worry about that.   The Real World Example Site   www.grandviewave.com m   The Grandview Avenue site was written in 2010 and continues to evolve. It’s a real site designed to give  local businesses an app and mobile site presence.    Each chapter in the book ends with a section called “Putting It All Together”, in which I show you   how I apply the concepts in the chapter to this real world application.   Hopefully you can see how this site works and either build one like it yourself, or do something   completely different.    xxi    Downloading the code  The code for the examples shown in this book is available on the Apress web site, www.apress.com. A link  can be found on the book’s information page  http:  www.apress.com 9781430240389  under the Source  Code Downloads tab.
