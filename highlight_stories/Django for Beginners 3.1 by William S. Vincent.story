In this book you will build five progressively more complex web applications, starting with a simple Hello, World app, progressing to a Pages app, a Message Board app, a Blog app with forms and user accounts, and finally a Newspaper app that uses a custom user model, email integration, foreign keys, authorization, permissions, and more. By the end of this book you will feel confident creating your own Django projects from scratch using current best practices.  Django is a free, open source web framework written in the Python2 programming language. A “web framework” is software that abstracts away many of the common challenges related to building a website, such as connecting to a database, handling security, user accounts, and so on. These days most developers rely on web frameworks rather than trying to build a website truly from scratch. Django in particular was first released in 2005 and has been in continuous development since then. Today, it is one of the most popular web frameworks available, used by the largest websites in the world–Instagram, Pinterest, Bitbucket, Disqus–but also flexible enough to be a good choice for early-stage startups and prototyping personal projects.  This book is regularly updated and features the latest versions of both Django and Python. It also uses Pipenv3 for managing Python packages and virtual environments, though using Pip4 works fine as well. Throughout we’ll be using modern best practices from the Django, Python, and web development communities including the thorough use of testing.  1https:  djangoproject.com 2https:  www.python.org  3https:  pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io en latest  4https:  github.com pypa pip   Introduction  Why Django  2  A web framework is a collection of modular tools that abstracts away much of the difficulty– and repetition–inherent in web development. For example, most websites need the same basic functionality: the ability to connect to a database, set URL routes, display content on a page, handle security properly, and so on. Rather than recreate all of this from scratch, programmers over the years have created web frameworks in all the major programming languages: Django and Flask5 in Python, Rails6 in Ruby, and Express7 in JavaScript among many, many others.  Django inherited Python’s “batteries-included” approach and includes out-of-the box support for common tasks in web development, including:    user authentication    testing    database models, forms, URL routes, and templates    admin interface    security and performance upgrades    support for multiple database backends  This approach allows web developers to focus on what makes a web application unique rather than reinventing the wheel every time for standard, secure web application functionality.  In contrast, several popular frameworks–most notably Flask in Python and Express in JavaScript– adopt a “microframework” approach. They provide only the bare minimum required for a simple web page and leave it up to the developer to install and configure third-party packages to replicate basic website functionality. This approach provides more flexibility to the developer but also yields more opportunities for mistakes.  As of 2019 Django has been under active development for over 14 years which makes it a grizzled veteran in software years. Millions of programmers have already used Django to build their websites, which is undeniably a good thing. Web development is hard. It doesn’t make sense to  5http:  flask.pocoo.org  6http:  rubyonrails.org  7https:  expressjs.com    Introduction  3  repeat the same code–and mistakes–when a large community of brilliant developers has already solved these problems for us.  At the same time, Django remains under active development8 and has a yearly release schedule. The Django community is constantly adding new features and security improvements. And best of all it’s written in the wonderfully readable yet still powerful Python programming language. In short, if you’re building a website from scratch Django is a fantastic choice.  Why This Book  I wrote this book because while Django is extremely well documented9 there is a severe lack of beginner-friendly tutorials available. When I first learned Django years ago, I struggled to even complete the official polls tutorial10. Why was this so hard I remember thinking?  With more experience, I now recognize that the writers of the Django docs faced a difficult choice: they could emphasize Django’s ease-of-use or its depth, but not both. They choose the latter and as a professional developer I appreciate the choice, but as a beginner I found it so…frustrating! My goal with this book is to fill in the gaps and showcase how beginner-friendly Django really can be.  You don’t need previous Python or web development experience to complete this book. It is intentionally written so that even a total beginner can follow along and feel the magic of writing their own web applications from scratch. However if you are serious about a career in web development, you will eventually need to invest the time to properly learn Python, HTML, and CSS. A list of recommended resources for further study is included in the Conclusion.  Book Structure  We start by properly covering how to configure a local development environment in Chapter 1. We’re using bleeding edge tools in this book: the most recent version of Django  3.1 , Python  8https:  www.djangoproject.com download supported-versions 9https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1  10https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 intro tutorial01    Introduction  4   3.8 , and Pipenv11 to manage our virtual environments. We also introduce the command line and discuss how to work with a modern text editor.  In Chapter 2 we build our first project, a minimal Hello, World app that demonstrates how to set up new Django projects. Because establishing good software practices is important, we’ll also save our work with Git and upload a copy to a remote code repository on GitHub12.  In Chapter 3 we make, test, and deploy a Pages app that introduces templates and class-based views. Templates are how Django allows for DRY  Don’t Repeat Yourself  development with HTML and CSS while class-based views are quite powerful yet require a minimal amount of code. We also add our first tests and deploy to Heroku13, which has a free tier we’ll use throughout this book. Using platform-as-a-service providers like Heroku transforms development from a painful, time-consuming process into something that takes just a few mouse clicks.  In Chapter 4 we build our first database-backed project, a Message Board app. Django provides a powerful ORM14 that allows us to write concise Python for our database tables. We’ll explore the built-in admin app which provides a graphical way to interact with our data and can be even used as a Content Management System  CMS  similar to Wordpress. Of course, we also write tests for all our code, store a remote copy on GitHub, and deploy to Heroku.  In Chapters 5-7 we’re ready for our next project: a robust Blog app that implements CRUD  Create-Read-Update-Delete  functionality. By using Django’s generic class-based views we only have to write only a small amount of actual code for this. Then we’ll add forms and integrate Django’s built-in user authentication system for sign up, log in, and log out functionality.  The remainder of the book, Chapters 8-16, is dedicated to building a robust Newspaper site, starting with the introduction to custom user models in Chapter 8, a Django best practice that is rarely addressed in tutorials. Chapter 9 covers user authentication, Chapter 10 adds Bootstrap for styling, and Chapters 11-12 implement password reset and change via email. With Chapters 13-15 we add articles and comments to our project, along with proper permissions and authorizations. We even learn some tricks for customizing the admin to display our growing data. And in Chapter 16, environment variables are introduced alongside proper deployment techniques.  11https:  pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io en latest  12https:  github.com  13https:  www.heroku.com  14https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Object-relational_mapping   Introduction  5  The Conclusion provides an overview of the major concepts introduced in the book and a list of recommended resources for further learning.  While you could pick and choose chapters to read, the book’s structure is deliberate. Each app chapter introduces a new concept and reinforces past teachings. I highly recommend reading the book in order, even if you’re eager to skip ahead. Later chapters won’t cover previous material in the same depth as earlier chapters.  By the end of this book you’ll have a solid understanding of how Django works, the ability to build apps on your own, and the background needed to fully take advantage of additional resources for learning intermediate and advanced Django techniques.  There are many code examples in this book, which are denoted as follows:  For brevity we will use dots ... to denote existing code that remains unchanged, for example, in a function we are updating.  Book Layout  Code   This is Python code print Hello, World   Code  def make_my_website:  ... print "All done!"   We will also use the command line console frequently to execute commands, which take the form of a $ prefix in traditional Unix style.   6  The result of this particular command is the next line will state:  We will typically combine a command and its output. The command will always be prefaced by a $ and the output will not. For example, the command and result above will be represented as follows:  Introduction  Command Line  $ echo "hello, world"  Command Line  "hello, world"  Command Line  $ echo "hello, world" hello, world  Official Source Code  Complete source code for all chapters can be found in the official GitHub repository15. While it’s best to type all the code by hand yourself, if you do find yourself stuck with a coding example or seeing a strange error, make sure to check your code against the official repo. And if you’re still stuck, try copy and pasting the official source code. A common error is subtle white spacing differences that are almost impossible to detect to the naked eye.  Conclusion  Django is an excellent choice for any developer who wants to build modern, robust web applications with a minimal amount of code. It is popular, under active development, and thoroughly battle-tested by the largest websites in the world. In the next chapter we’ll learn how to configure any computer for Django development.  15https:  github.com wsvincent djangoforbeginners   Chapter 1: Initial Set Up  This chapter covers how to properly configure your computer to work on Django projects. We start with an overview of the command line and how to install the latest version of Django and Python. Then we discuss virtual environments, git, and working with a text editor. By the end of this chapter you’ll be ready to create and modify new Django projects in just a few keystrokes.  The Command Line  The command line is a powerful, text-only view of your computer. As developers we will use it extensively throughout this book to install and configure each Django project.  On a Mac, the command line is found in a program called Terminal. To find it, open a new Finder window, open the Applications directory, scroll down to open the Utilities directory, and double- click the application called Terminal.  On Windows machines there are actually two built-in command shells: the Command shell and PowerShell. You should use PowerShell, which is the more powerful of the two.  Going forward when the book refers to the “command line” it means to open a new console on your computer, using either Terminal or PowerShell.  While there are many possible commands we can use, in practice there are six used most frequently in Django development:    cd  change down a directory    cd ..  change up a directory    ls  list files in your current directory on Mac    dir  list files in your current directory on Windows    pwd  print working directory    mkdir  make directory    Chapter 1: Initial Set Up  8    touch  create a new file on Mac   Open your command line and try them out. The dollar sign  $  is our command line prompt: all commands in this book are intended to be typed after the $ prompt.  For example, assuming you’re on a Mac, let’s change into our Desktop directory.  Note that our current location,  cid:24  Desktop, is automatically added before our command line prompt. To confirm we’re in the proper location we can use pwd which will print out the path of our current directory.  Command Line  $ cd ~ Desktop  Command Line  ~ Desktop $ pwd  Users wsv desktop  On my Mac computer this shows that I’m using the user wsv and on the desktop for that account.  Now let’s create a new directory with mkdir, cd into it, and add a new file index.html with the touch command. Note that Windows machines unfortunately do not support a native touch command. In future chapters when instructed to create a new file, do so within your text editor of choice.  Command Line  ~ Desktop $ mkdir new_dir && cd new_dir ~ Desktop new_dir $ touch index.html  Now use ls to list all current files in our directory. You’ll see there’s just the newly created index.html.   9  Chapter 1: Initial Set Up  Command Line ~ Desktop new_dir $ ls index.html  Command Line ~ Desktop new_dir $ cd .. ~ Desktop $ pwd  Users wsv desktop  As a final step, return to the Desktop directory with cd .. and use pwd to confirm the location.  Advanced developers can use their keyboard and command line to navigate through their computer with ease. With practice this approach is much faster than using a mouse.  In this book I’ll give you the exact instructions to run–you don’t need to be an expert on the command line–but over time it’s a good skill for any professional software developer to develop. A good free resource for further study is the Command Line Crash Course16.  Install Python 3  It takes some configuration to properly install Python 3 on a Mac, Windows, Linux, or Chrome- book computer and there are multiple approaches. Many developers–especially beginners– follow the advice on the official Python website17 to download distinct versions of Python directly onto their computer and then adjust the PATH variable18 accordingly.  The problem with this approach is that updating the PATH variable correctly is tricky, by downloading Python directly updates are harder to maintain, and there are now much easier ways to install and start using Python quickly.  I host a dedicated website, InstallPython3.com19, with up-to-date guides for installing Python 3 on Mac, Windows, or Linux computers. Please refer there to install Python correctly on your local machine.  16https:  learnpythonthehardway.org book appendixa.html 17https:  www.python.org downloads  18https:  www.python.org downloads  19https:  installpython3.com   Chapter 1: Initial Set Up  Virtual Environments  10  Virtual environments20 are an indispensable part of Python programming. They are an isolated container containing all the software dependencies for a given project. This is important because by default software like Python and Django is installed in the same directory. This causes a problem when you want to work on multiple projects on the same computer. What if ProjectA uses Django 3.1 but ProjectB from last year is still on Django 2.2? Without virtual environments this becomes very difficult; with virtual environments it’s no problem at all.  There are many areas of software development that are hotly debated, but using virtual environ- ments for Python development is not one. You should use a dedicated virtual environment for each new Python project.  In this book we will use Pipenv21 to manage virtual environments. Pipenv is similar to npm and yarn from the JavaScript Node ecosystem: it creates a Pipfile containing software dependencies and a Pipfile.lock for ensuring deterministic builds. “Determinism” means that each and every time you download the software in a new virtual environment, you will have exactly the same configuration.  Sebastian McKenzie, the creator of Yarn22 which first introduced this concept to JavaScript packaging, has a concise blog post explaining what determinism is and why it matters23. The end result is that we will create a new virtual environment with Pipenv for each new Django Project.  To install Pipenv we can use pip3 which Homebrew automatically installed for us alongside Python 3.  Command Line  $ pip3 install pipenv  20https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Virtual_environment_software 21https:  pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io en latest  22https:  yarnpkg.com en  23https:  yarnpkg.com blog 2017 05 31 determinism    11  To see Pipenv in action, let’s create a new directory and install Django. First, navigate to the Desktop, create a new directory django, and enter it with cd.  Chapter 1: Initial Set Up  Install Django  Command Line  $ cd ~ Desktop $ mkdir django $ cd django  Now use Pipenv to install Django. Note the use of  cid:24 = which will ensure security updates for Django, such as 3.1.1, 3.1.2, and so on.  Command Line  $ pipenv install django~=3.1.0  If you look within our directory, there are now two new files: Pipfile and Pipfile.lock. We have the information we need for a new virtual environment but we have not activated it yet. Let’s do that with pipenv shell.  Command Line  $ pipenv shell  If you are on a Mac you should now see parentheses around the name of your current directory on your command line which indicates the virtual environment is activated. Since we’re in a django directory that means we should see  django  at the beginning of the command line prompt. Windows users will not see the shell prompt. If you can run django-admin startproject in the next section then you know your virtual environment has Django installed properly.   Chapter 1: Initial Set Up  Command Line   django  $  12  This means it’s working! Create a new Django project called config with the following command. Don’t forget that period . at the end.  Command Line   django  $ django-admin startproject config .  It’s worth pausing here to explain why you should add a period  .  to the command. If you just run django-admin startproject config then by default Django will create this directory structure:  Layout  └── config  ├── config │ │ │ │ │ └── manage.py  ├── __init__.py ├── asgi.py ├── settings.py ├── urls.py └── wsgi.py  See how it creates a new directory config and then within it a manage.py file and a config directory? That feels redundant to me since we already created and navigated into a django directory on our Desktop. By running django-admin startproject config . with the period at the end–which says, install in the current directory–the result is instead this:   Chapter 1: Initial Set Up  Layout ├── config │ │ │ │ │ └── manage.py  ├── __init__.py ├── asgi.py ├── settings.py ├── urls.py └── wsgi.py  13  The takeaway is that it doesn’t really matter if you include the period or not at the end of the command, but I prefer to include the period and so that’s how we’ll do it in this book.  As you progress in your journey learning Django, you’ll start to bump up more and more into similar situations where there are different opinions within the Django community on the correct best practice. Django is eminently customizable, which is a great strength, however the tradeoff is that this flexibility comes at the cost of seeming complexity. Generally speaking, it’s a good idea to research any such issues that arise, make a decision, and then stick with it!  Now let’s confirm everything is working by running Django’s local web server.  Command Line  django  $ python manage.py runserver Watching for file changes with StatReloader Performing system checks...  System check identified no issues  0 silenced .  You have 18 unapplied migration s . Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app s : admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions. Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.  August 3, 2020 - 14:52:27 Django version 3.1, using settings 'config.settings' Starting development server at http:  127.0.0.1:8000  Quit the server with CONTROL-C.  Don’t worry about the text in red about “18 unapplied migrations.” We’ll get to that shortly but the   Chapter 1: Initial Set Up  14  important part, for now, is to visit http:  127.0.0.1:8000  and make sure the following image is visible:  Django welcome page  To stop our local server type Control+c. Then exit our virtual environment using the command exit.   15  Chapter 1: Initial Set Up  Command Line  django  $ exit  Install Git  We can always reactivate the virtual environment again using pipenv shell at any time.  We’ll get lots of practice with virtual environments in this book so don’t worry if it’s a little confusing right now. The basic pattern is to install new packages with pipenv, activate them with pipenv shell, and then exit when done.  It’s worth noting that only one virtual environment can be active in a command line tab at a time. In future chapters we will be creating a brand new virtual environment for each new project so either make sure to exit your current environment or open up a new tab for new projects.  Git24 is an indispensable part of modern software development. It is a version control system25 which can be thought of as an extremely powerful version of track changes in Microsoft Word or Google Docs. With git, you can collaborate with other developers, track all your work via commits, and revert to any previous version of your code even if you accidentally delete something important!  On a Mac, because Homebrew is already installed, we can simply type brew install git on the command line:  Command Line $ brew install git  On Windows you should download Git from Git for Windows26. Click the “Download” button and follow the prompts for installation.  Once installed, we need to do a one-time system set up to configure it by declaring the name and email address you want associated with all your Git commits. Within the command line console type the following two lines. Make sure to update them your name and email address.  24https:  Git-scm.com  25https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Version_control 26https:  gitforwindows.org    16  $ git config --global user.name "Your Name" $ git config --global user.email "yourname@email.com"  You can always change these configs later if you desire by retyping the same commands with a new name or email address.  Chapter 1: Initial Set Up  Command Line  Text Editors  The final step is our text editor. While the command line is where we execute commands for our programs, a text editor is where the actual code is written. The computer doesn’t care what text editor you use–the end result is just code–but a good text editor can provide helpful hints and catch typos for you.  Experienced developers often prefer using either Vim27 or Emacs28, both decades-old, text-only editors with loyal followings. However each has a steep learning curve and requires memorizing many different keystroke combinations. I don’t recommend them for newcomers.  Modern text editors combine the same powerful features with an appealing visual interface. My current favorite is Visual Studio Code29 which is free, easy to install, and enjoys widespread popularity. If you’re not already using a text editor, download and install Visual Studio Code30 now.  Conclusion  Phew! Nobody really likes configuring a local development environment but fortunately it’s a one-time pain. We have now learned how to work with virtual environments and installed the latest version of Python and git. Everything is ready for our first Django app.  27https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Vim_ text_editor  28https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Emacs 29https:  code.visualstudio.com  30https:  code.visualstudio.com    Chapter 2: Hello World App  In this chapter we’ll build a Django project that simply says “Hello, World” on the homepage. This is the traditional way31 to start a new programming language or framework. We’ll also work with Git for the first time and deploy our code to GitHub.  If you become stuck at any point, complete source code for this and all future chapters is available online on the official GitHub repo32.  To begin, navigate to a new directory on your computer. For example, we can create a helloworld directory on the Desktop with the following commands.  Initial Set Up  Command Line  $ cd ~ Desktop $ mkdir helloworld && cd helloworld  Make sure you’re not already in an existing virtual environment at this point. If you see text in parentheses    before the dollar sign  $  then you are. To exit it, type exit and hit Return. The parentheses should disappear which means that virtual environment is no longer active.  We’ll use pipenv to create a new virtual environment, install Django, and then activate it.  31https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki %22Hello,_World!%22_program 32https:  github.com wsvincent djangoforbeginners   Chapter 2: Hello World App  18  Command Line  $ pipenv install django~=3.1.0 $ pipenv shell  If you are on a Mac you should see parentheses now at the beginning of your command line prompt in the form  helloworld . If you are on Windows you will not see a visual prompt at this time.  Create a new Django project called config making sure to include the period  .  at the end of the command so that it is installed in our current directory.  Command Line   helloworld  $ django-admin startproject config .  If you use the tree command you can see what our Django project structure now looks like.  Note: If tree doesn’t work for you, install it with Homebrew: brew install tree.   Command Line   helloworld  $ tree . ├── Pipfile ├── Pipfile.lock ├── config │  │ │ │ └── manage.py  ├── __init__.py ├── asgi.py ├── settings.py ├── urls.py └── wsgi.py  1 directory, 8 files  The config settings.py file controls our project’s settings, urls.py tells Django which pages to build in response to a browser or URL request, and wsgi.py, which stands for Web Server Gateway Interface33, helps Django serve our eventual web pages. The manage.py file is used to  33https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Web_Server_Gateway_Interface   Chapter 2: Hello World App  19  execute various Django commands such as running the local web server or creating a new app. Last, but not least, is the asgi.py file, new to Django as of version 3.0 which allows for an optional Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface34 to be run.  Django comes with a built-in web server for local development purposes which we can now start with the runserver command.  Command Line   helloworld  $ python manage.py runserver  If you visit http:  127.0.0.1:8000  you should see the following image:  34https:  asgi.readthedocs.io en latest specs main.html   Chapter 2: Hello World App  20  Django welcome page  Note that the full command line output will contain additional information including a warning about 18 unapplied migrations.   Chapter 2: Hello World App  21  Command Line Watching for file changes with StatReloader Performing system checks...  System check identified no issues  0 silenced .  You have 18 unapplied migration s . Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app s : admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions. Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.  August 3, 2020 - 14:57:42 Django version 3.1, using settings 'config.settings' Starting development server at http:  127.0.0.1:8000  Quit the server with CONTROL-C.  Technically this warning doesn’t matter at this point. Django is complaining that we have not yet “migrated,” or configured, our initial database. Since we won’t actually use a database in this chapter, the warning won’t affect the end result.  However, since warnings are still annoying to see, we can remove it by first stopping the local server with the Control+c command and then running python manage.py migrate.  Command Line $ python manage.py migrate Operations to perform:  Running migrations:  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial...

August 3, 2020 - 15:23:14 Django version 3.1, using settings 'config.settings' Starting development server at http:  127.0.0.1:8000  Quit the server with CONTROL-C.  Create An App  Django uses the concept of projects and apps to keep code clean and readable. A single Django project contains one or more apps within it that all work together to power a web application. This is why the command for a new Django project is startproject.  For example, a real-world Django e-commerce site might have one app for user authentication, another app for payments, and a third app to power item listing details: each focuses on an isolated piece of functionality. That’s three distinct apps that all live within one top-level project.  How and when you split functionality into apps is somewhat subjective, but in general, each app should have a clear function.  Now it’s time to create our first app. From the command line, quit the server with Control+c. Then use the startapp command followed by the name of our app, which will be pages.   Chapter 2: Hello World App  Command Line   helloworld  $ python manage.py startapp pages  23  If you look again inside the directory with the tree command you’ll see Django has created a pages directory with the following files:  Command Line   helloworld  $ tree ├── pages │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │  ├── __init__.py ├── admin.py ├── apps.py ├── migrations │ ├── models.py ├── tests.py └── views.py  └── __init__.py  Let’s review what each new pages app file does:    admin.py is a configuration file for the built-in Django Admin app   apps.py is a configuration file for the app itself   migrations  keeps track of any changes to our models.py file so our database and    models.py is where we define our database models which Django automatically translates  models.py stay in sync  into database tables    tests.py is for our app-specific tests   views.py is where we handle the request response logic for our web app  Even though our new app exists within the Django project, Django doesn’t “know” about it until we explicitly add it. Open the config settings.py file and scroll down to INSTALLED_APPS where you’ll see six built-in Django apps already there. Add our new pages app at the bottom.   24  Chapter 2: Hello World App  Code  config settings.py INSTALLED_APPS = [  'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'pages',  new  ]  Don’t worry if you are confused at this point: it takes practice to internalize how Django projects and apps are structured. Over the course of this book we will build many projects and apps and the patterns will soon become familiar.  URLs, Views, Models, Templates  In Django, at least three  often four  separate files are required to power one single page. Within an app these are the urls.py file, the views.py file, the models.py file, and finally an HTML template such as index.html.  This interaction is fundamental to Django yet very confusing to newcomers so let’s map out the order of a given HTTP request response cycle. When you type in a URL, such as https:  djangoforbeginners.com, the first thing that happens within our Django project is a URLpattern is found that matches the homepage. The URLpattern specifies a view which then determines the content for the page  usually from a database model  and then ultimately a template for styling and basic logic. The end result is sent back to the user as an HTTP response.  The complete flow looks like this:  Django request response cycle URL -> View -> Model  typically  -> Template  Remember how I said it can take three or four files for a given page? That’s because a model is not always needed, in which case three files are enough. But generally speaking four will be used as we’ll see later in this book.   Chapter 2: Hello World App  25  The main takeaway here is that in Django views determine what content is displayed on a given page while URLConfs determine where that content is going. The model contains the content from the database and the template provides styling for it.  When a user requests a specific page, like the homepage, the urls.py file uses a regular expression35 to map that request to the appropriate view function which then returns the correct data. In other words, our view will output the text “Hello, World” while our url will ensure that when the user visits the homepage they are redirected to the correct view.  To see this in action, let’s start by updating the views.py file in our pages app to look as follows:  Code   pages views.py from django.http import HttpResponse  def homePageView request :  return HttpResponse 'Hello, World!'   Basically, we’re saying whenever the view function homePageView is called, return the text “Hello, World!” More specifically, we’ve imported the built-in HttpResponse36 method so we can return a response object to the user. We’ve created a function called homePageView that accepts the request object and returns a response with the string “Hello, World!”  Now we need to configure our urls. Within the pages app, create a new urls.py file which on a Mac can be done with the touch command; Windows users must create the file within a text editor.  Command Line   helloworld  $ touch pages urls.py  Then update it with the following code:  35https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Regular_expression 36https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref request-response django.http.HttpResponse   Chapter 2: Hello World App  26  Code  ]   pages urls.py from django.urls import path from .views import homePageView  urlpatterns = [  path '', homePageView, name='home' ,  On the top line we import path from Django to power our URLpattern and on the next line we import our views. By referring to the views.py file as .views we are telling Django to look within the current directory for a views.py file and import the view homePageView from there.  Our URLpattern has three parts:    a Python regular expression for the empty string ''   a reference to the view called homePageView   an optional named URL pattern37 called 'home'  In other words, if the user requests the homepage represented by the empty string '', Django should use the view called homePageView.  We’re almost done at this point. The last step is to update our config urls.py file. It’s common to have multiple apps within a single Django project, like pages here, and they each need their own dedicated URL path.  37https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics http urls naming-url-patterns   Chapter 2: Hello World App  27  Code  ]   config urls.py from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import path, include  new  urlpatterns = [  path 'admin ', admin.site.urls , path '', include 'pages.urls'  ,  new  We’ve imported include on the second line next to path and then created a new URLpattern for our pages app. Now whenever a user visits the homepage, they will first be routed to the pages app and then to the homePageView view set in the pages urls.py file.  This need for two separate urls.py files is often confusing to beginners. Think of the top-level config urls.py as the gateway to various url patterns distinct to each app.  Hello, World!  We have all the code we need now. To confirm everything works as expected, restart our Django server:  Command Line   helloworld  $ python manage.py runserver  If you refresh the browser for http:  127.0.0.1:8000  it now displays the text “Hello, World!”  Hello World homepage   28  In the previous chapter we also installed Git which is a version control system. Let’s use it here. The first step is to initialize  or add  Git to our repository. Make sure you’ve stopped the local server with Control+c, then run the command git init.  If you then type git status you’ll see a list of changes since the last Git commit. Since this is our first commit, this list is all of our changes so far.  Chapter 2: Hello World App  Git  Command Line   helloworld  $ git init  Command Line   helloworld  $ git status On branch master  No commits yet  Untracked files:  Pipfile Pipfile.lock config  db.sqlite3 manage.py pages    use "git add  ..." to include in what will be committed   nothing added to commit but untracked files present  use "git add" to track   We next want to add all changes by using the command add -A and then commit the changes along with a message,  -m , describing what has changed.   Chapter 2: Hello World App  Command Line   helloworld  $ git add -A  helloworld  $ git commit -m "initial commit"  GitHub  29  It’s a good habit to create a remote repository of your code for each project. This way you have a backup in case anything happens to your computer and more importantly, it allows for collaboration with other software developers. Popular choices include GitHub38, Bitbucket39, and GitLab40. When you’re learning web development, it’s best to stick to private rather than public repositories so you don’t inadvertently post critical information such as passwords online.  We will use GitHub in this book but all three services offer similar functionality for newcomers. Sign up for a free account on GitHub’s homepage and verify your email address. Then navigate to the “Create a new repository” page located at https:  github.com new41.  Enter the repository name hello-world and click on the radio button next to “Private” rather than “Public.” Then click on the button at the bottom for “Create Repository.”  38https:  github.com  39https:  bitbucket.org  40https:  about.gitlab.com  41https:  github.com new   Chapter 2: Hello World App  30  GitHub New Repository  Your first repository is now created! However there is no code in it yet. Scroll down on the page to where it says “…or push an existing repository from the command line.” That’s what we want.   Chapter 2: Hello World App  31  GitHub Hello, World repository  Copy the text immediately under this headline and paste it into your command line. Note that my username is wsvincent here; yours will be different so if you copy my snippet below it won’t work! This syncs the local directory on our computer with the remote repository on the GitHub website.   Chapter 2: Hello World App  32  Command Line  helloworld  $ git remote add origin https:  github.com wsvincent hello-world.git  The last step is to “push” our code to GitHub.  Command Line  helloworld  $ git push -u origin master  Hopefully this command works and you can go back to your GitHub page and refresh it to see your local code now hosted online.  SSH Keys  Unfortunately, there is a good chance that the last command yielded an error if you are a new developer and do not have SSH keys already configured.  Command Line ERROR: Repository not found. fatal: Could not read from remote repository.  Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.  This cryptic message means we need to configure SSH keys. This is a one-time thing but a bit of a hassle to be honest.  SSH is a protocol used to ensure private connections with a remote server. Think of it as an additional layer of privacy on top of username password. The process involves generating unique SSH keys and storing them on your computer so only GitHub can access them.  First, check whether you have existing SSH keys. Github has a guide to this42 that works for Mac, Windows, and Linux. If you don’t have existing public and private keys, you’ll need to generate them. GitHub, again, has a guide on doing this43.  42https:  help.github.com en articles checking-for-existing-ssh-keys 43https:  help.github.com en articles generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent   Chapter 2: Hello World App  33  Once complete you should be able to execute the git push -u origin master command successfully!  It’s normal to feel overwhelmed and frustrated if you become stuck with SSH keys. GitHub has a lot of resources to walk you through it but the reality is its very intimidating the first time. If you’re truly stuck, continue with the book and come back to SSH Keys and GitHub with a full nights sleep. I can’t count the number of times a clear head has helped me process a difficult programming issue.  Assuming success with GitHub, go ahead and exit our virtual environment with the exit command.  Command Line   helloworld  $ exit  Conclusion  You should no longer see parentheses on your command line, indicating the virtual environment is no longer active.  Congratulations! We’ve covered a lot of fundamental concepts in this chapter. We built our first Django application and learned about Django’s project app structure. We started to learn about views, urls, and the internal Django web server. And we worked with Git to track our changes and pushed our code into a private repo on GitHub.  Continue on to Chapter 3: Pages app where we’ll build and deploy a more complex Django application using templates and class-based views.   Chapter 3: Pages App  In this chapter we will build, test, and deploy a Pages app with a homepage and about page. We’ll learn about Django’s class-based views and templates which are the building blocks for the more complex web applications built later on in the book.  Initial Set Up  As in Chapter 2: Hello World App, our initial set up involves the following steps:    create a directory for our code    install Django in a new virtual environment    create a new Django project   create a new pages app   update config settings.py  On the command line make sure you’re not working in an existing virtual environment. If there is text before the dollar sign  $  in parentheses, then you are! Make sure to type exit to leave it.  We will again create a new directory called pages for our project on the Desktop, but, truthfully you can put your code anywhere you like on your computer. It just needs to be in its own directory that is easily accessible.  Within a new command line console start by typing the following:   35  Open your text editor and navigate to the file config settings.py. Add the pages app at the bottom of the INSTALLED_APPS setting:  Chapter 3: Pages App  Command Line  $ cd ~ Desktop $ mkdir pages && cd pages $ pipenv install django~=3.1.0 $ pipenv shell  pages  $ django-admin startproject config .  pages  $ python manage.py startapp pages  Code   config settings.py INSTALLED_APPS = [  'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'pages',  new  ]  Start the local web server with runserver.  Command Line   pages  $ python manage.py runserver  And then navigate to http:  127.0.0.1:8000 .   Chapter 3: Pages App  36  Django welcome page  Templates  Every web framework needs a convenient way to generate HTML files and in Django the approach is to use templates: individual HTML files that can be linked together and also include   Chapter 3: Pages App  basic logic.  37  Recall that in the previous chapter our “Hello, World” site had the phrase hardcoded into a views.py file as a string. That technically works but doesn’t scale well! A better approach is to link a view to a template, thereby separating the information contained in each.  In this chapter we’ll learn how to use templates to more easily create our desired homepage and about page. And in future chapters, the use of templates will support building websites that can support hundreds, thousands, or even millions of webpages with a minimal amount of code.  The first consideration is where to place templates within the structure of a Django project. There are two options. By default, Django’s template loader will look within each app for related templates. However the structure is somewhat confusing: each app needs a new templates directory, another directory with the same name as the app, and then the template file.  Therefore, in our pages app, Django would expect the following layout:  Layout  └── pages  ├── templates ├── pages  ├── home.html  This means we would need to create a new templates directory, a new directory with the name of the app, pages, and finally our template itself which is home.html.  Why this seemingly repetitive approach? The short answer is that the Django template loader wants to be really sure it finds the correct template! What happens if there are home.html files within two separate apps? This structure makes sure there are no such conflicts.  There is, however, another approach which is to instead create a single project-level templates directory and place all templates within there. By making a small tweak to our config settings.py file we can tell Django to also look in this directory for templates. That is the approach we’ll use.  First, quit the running server with the Control+c command. Then create a directory called templates and an HTML file called home.html.   Chapter 3: Pages App  38  Command Line  pages  $ mkdir templates  pages  $ touch templates home.html  Next we need to update config settings.py to tell Django the location of our new templates directory. This is a one-line change to the setting 'DIRS' under TEMPLATES.  Code  config settings.py TEMPLATES = [  {  },  ]  ... 'DIRS': [str BASE_DIR.joinpath 'templates'  ],  new ...  Then we can add a simple headline to our home.html file.  Code    Homepage   Ok, our template is complete! The next step is to configure our URL and view files.  Class-Based Views  Early versions of Django only shipped with function-based views, but developers soon found themselves repeating the same patterns over and over again. Write a view that lists all objects in a model. Write a view that displays only one detailed item from a model. And so on.  Function-based generic views were introduced to abstract these patterns and streamline development of common patterns. However, there was no easy way to extend or customize these views44. As a result, Django introduced class-based generic views that make it easy to use and also extend views covering common use cases.  44https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics class-based-views intro    Chapter 3: Pages App  39  Classes are a fundamental part of Python but a thorough discussion of them is beyond the scope of this book. If you need an introduction or refresher, I suggest reviewing the official Python docs45 which have an excellent tutorial on classes and their usage.  In our view we’ll use the built-in TemplateView46 to display our template. Update the pages views.py file.  Code   pages views.py from django.views.generic import TemplateView  class HomePageView TemplateView :  template_name = 'home.html'  Note that we’ve capitalized our view, HomePageView, since it’s now a Python class. Classes, unlike functions, should always be capitalized47. The TemplateView already contains all the logic needed to display our template, we just need to specify the template’s name.  URLs  The last step is to update our URLConfs. Recall from Chapter 2 that we need to make updates in two locations. First, we update the config urls.py file to point at our pages app and then within pages we match views to URL routes.  Let’s start with the config urls.py file.  45https:  docs.python.org 3.8 tutorial classes.html 46https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref class-based-views base django.views.generic.base.  TemplateView  47https:  www.python.org dev peps pep-0008 class-names   Chapter 3: Pages App  40  The code here should look familiar at this point. We add include on the second line to point the existing URL to the pages app. Next create an app-level urls.py file.  Code  config urls.py from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import path, include  new  urlpatterns = [  path 'admin ', admin.site.urls , path '', include 'pages.urls'  ,  new  ]  ]  Command Line  pages  $ touch pages urls.py  And add the following code.  Code  pages urls.py from django.urls import path from .views import HomePageView  urlpatterns = [  path '', HomePageView.as_view  , name='home' ,  This pattern is almost identical to what we did in Chapter 2 with one major difference: when using Class-Based Views, you always add as_view   at the end of the view name.  And we’re done! Start up the local web server with python manage.py runserver and navigate to http:  127.0.0.1:8000  to see our new homepage.  Homepage   Chapter 3: Pages App  About Page  41  The process for adding an about page is very similar to what we just did. We’ll create a new template file, a new view, and a new url route.  Quit the server with Control+c and create a new template called about.html.  Command Line   pages  $ touch templates about.html  Then populate it with a short HTML headline.     About page   Create a new view for the page.  Code  Code   pages views.py from django.views.generic import TemplateView  class HomePageView TemplateView :  template_name = 'home.html'  class AboutPageView TemplateView :  new  template_name = 'about.html'  And then import the view name and connect it to a URL at about .   Chapter 3: Pages App  42  Code  pages urls.py from django.urls import path from .views import HomePageView, AboutPageView  new  urlpatterns = [  ]  path 'about ', AboutPageView.as_view  , name='about' ,  new path '', HomePageView.as_view  , name='home' ,  Start up the web server with python manage.py runserver. Navigate to http:  127.0.0.1:8000 about and the new About page is visible.  About page  Extending Templates  The real power of templates is their ability to be extended. If you think about most websites, there is content that is repeated on every page  header, footer, etc . Wouldn’t it be nice if we, as developers, could have one canonical place for our header code that would be inherited by all other templates?  Well we can! Let’s create a base.html file containing a header with links to our two pages. We could name this file anything but using base.html is a common convention. Type Control+c and then create the new file.  Command Line  pages  $ touch templates base.html  Django has a minimal templating language for adding links and basic logic in our templates. You can see the full list of built-in template tags here in the official docs48. Template tags take the  48https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref templates builtins built-in-template-tags-and-filters   Chapter 3: Pages App  43  form of {% something %} where the “something” is the template tag itself. You can even create your own custom template tags, though we won’t do that in this book.  To add URL links in our project we can use the built-in url template tag49 which takes the URL pattern name as an argument. Remember how we added optional URL names to our two routes in pages urls.py? This is why. The url tag uses these names to automatically create links for us.  The URL route for our homepage is called home. To configure a link to it we use the following syntax: {% url 'home' %}.  Code        Home    About      {% block content %} {% endblock content %}  At the bottom we’ve added a block tag called content. Blocks can be overwritten by child templates via inheritance. While it’s optional to name our closing endblock–you can just write {% endblock %} if you prefer–doing so helps with readability, especially in larger template files.  Let’s update our home.html and about.html files to extend the base.html template. That means we can reuse the same code from one template in another template. The Django templating language comes with an extends50 method that we can use for this.  49https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref templates builtins url 50https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref templates builtins extends   Chapter 3: Pages App  44    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block content %}  Homepage  {% endblock content %}  Code  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block content %}  About page  {% endblock content %}  Now if you start up the server with python manage.py runserver and open up our webpages again at http:  127.0.0.1:8000  and http:  127.0.0.1:8000 about you’ll see the header is magically included in both locations.  Nice, right?  Homepage with header  About page with header   Chapter 3: Pages App  45  There’s a lot more we can do with templates and in practice you’ll typically create a base.html file and then add additional templates on top of it in a robust Django project. We’ll do this later on in the book.  Tests  Finally, we come to tests. Even in an application this basic, it’s important to add tests and get in the habit of always adding them to our Django projects. In the words of Django co-creator Jacob Kaplan-Moss51, “Code without tests is broken as designed.”  Writing tests is important because it automates the process of confirming that the code works as expected. In an app like this one, we can manually look and see that the home page and about page exist and contain the intended content. But as a Django project grows in size there can be hundreds if not thousands of individual web pages and the idea of manually going through each page is not possible. Further, whenever we make changes to the code–adding new features, updating existing ones, deleting unused areas of the site–we want to be sure that we have not inadvertently broken some other piece of the site. Automated tests let us write one time how we expect a specific piece of our project to behave and then let the computer do the checking for us.  And fortunately, Django comes with built-in testing tools52 for writing and running tests.  If you look within our pages app, Django already provided a tests.py file we can use. Open it and add the following code:  51https:  jacobian.org  52https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics testing overview    46  Chapter 3: Pages App  Code   pages tests.py from django.test import SimpleTestCase  class SimpleTests SimpleTestCase :  def test_home_page_status_code self :  response = self.client.get ' '  self.assertEqual response.status_code, 200   def test_about_page_status_code self :  response = self.client.get ' about '  self.assertEqual response.status_code, 200   We’re using SimpleTestCase53 here since we aren’t using a database. If we were using a database, we’d instead use TestCase54. Then we perform a check if the status code for each page is 200, which is the standard response for a successful HTTP request55. That’s a fancy way of saying it ensures that a given webpage actually exists, but says nothing about the content of said page.  To run the tests quit the server Control+c and type python manage.py test on the command line:   pages  $ python manage.py test System check identified no issues  0 silenced . .. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ran 2 tests in 0.014s  Command Line  OK  Success! We’ll do much more with testing in the future, especially once we start working with databases. For now, it’s important to see how easy it is to add tests each and every time we add new functionality to our Django project.  53https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics testing tools django.test.SimpleTestCase 54https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics testing tools django.test.TestCase 55https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki List_of_HTTP_status_codes   47  Chapter 3: Pages App  Git and GitHub  Command Line  pages  $ git init  It’s time to track our changes with Git and push them up to GitHub. We’ll start by initializing our directory.  Use git status to see all our code changes and then git add -A to add them all. Finally, we’ll add our first commit message.  Command Line  pages  $ git status  pages  $ git add -A  pages  $ git commit -m "initial commit"  Over on GitHub create a new repo56 called pages-app and make sure to select the “Private” radio button. Then click on the “Create repository” button.  On the next page, scroll down to where it says “…or push an existing repository from the command line.” Copy and paste the two commands there into your terminal.  It should look like the below albeit instead of wsvincent as the username it will be your GitHub username.  Command Line  pages  $ git remote add origin https:  github.com wsvincent pages-app.git  pages  $ git push -u origin master  Local vs Production  To make our site available on the Internet where everyone can see it, we need to deploy our code to an external server and database. This is called putting our code into production. Local code lives only on our computer; production code lives on an external server available to everyone.  56https:  github.com new   Chapter 3: Pages App  48  The startproject command creates a new project configured for local development via the file config settings.py. This ease-of-use means when it does come time to push the project into production, a number of settings have to be changed.  One of these is the web server. Django comes with its own basic server, suitable for local usage, but it is not suitable for production. There are two options available: Gunicorn57 and uWSGI58. Gunicorn is the simpler to configure and more than adequate for our projects so that will be what we use.  For our hosting provider we will use Heroku59 because it is free for small projects, widely-used, and has a relatively straightforward deployment process.  Heroku  You can sign up for a free Heroku60 account on their website. After you confirm your email Heroku will redirect you to the dashboard section of the site.  Now we need to install Heroku’s Command Line Interface  CLI  so we can deploy from the command line. Currently, we are operating within a virtual environment for our Pages project but we want Heroku available globally, that is everywhere on our machine. An easy way to do so is open up a new command line tab–Command+t on a Mac, Control+t on Windows–which is not operating in a virtual environment. Anything installed here will be global.  Within this new tab, on a Mac use Homebrew to install Heroku:  Command Line  $ brew install heroku brew heroku  On Windows, see the Heroku CLI page61 to correctly install either the 32-bit or 64-bit version. If you are using Linux there are specific install instructions62 available on the Heroku website.  57http:  gunicorn.org  58https:  uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io en latest  59https:  www.heroku.com  60https:  www.heroku.com  61https:  devcenter.heroku.com articles heroku-clidownload-and-install 62https:  devcenter.heroku.com articles heroku-cli   Chapter 3: Pages App  49  Once installation is complete you can close our new command line tab and return to the initial tab with the pages virtual environment active.  Type the command heroku login and use the email and password for Heroku you just set.  Command Line   pages  $ heroku login Enter your Heroku credentials: Email: will@learndjango.com Password: ********************************* Logged in as will@learndjango.com  Deployment typically requires a number of discrete steps. It is common to have a “checklist” for these since there quickly become too many to remember. At this stage, we are intentionally keeping things basic so there are only two additional steps required, however this list will grow in future projects as we add additional security and performance features.  Here is the deployment checklist:    install Gunicorn   add a Procfile file   update ALLOWED_HOSTS  Gunicorn can be installed using Pipenv.  Command Line   pages  $ pipenv install gunicorn==19.9.0  The Procfile is a Heroku-specific file that can include multiple lines but, in our case, will have just one specifying the use of Gunicorn as the production web server. Create the Procfile now.  Command Line   pages  $ touch Procfile  Open the Procfile with your text editor and add the following line.   Chapter 3: Pages App  Procfile  web: gunicorn config.wsgi --log-file -  50  The ALLOWED_HOSTS63 setting represents which host domain names our Django site can serve. This is a security measure to prevent HTTP Host header attacks, which are possible even under many seemingly-safe web server configurations. For now, we’ll use the wildcard asterisk, *, which means all domains are acceptable. Later in the book we’ll see how to explicitly list the domains that should be allowed.  Within the config settings.py, scroll down to ALLOWED_HOSTS and add a '*' so it looks as follows:  Code   config settings.py ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']  That’s it. Keep in mind we’ve taken a number of security shortcuts here but the goal is to push our project into production in as few steps as possible.  Use git status to check our changes, add the new files, and then commit them:  Command Line   pages  $ git status  pages  $ git add -A  pages  $ git commit -m "New updates for Heroku deployment"  Finally push to GitHub so we have an online backup of our code changes.  Command Line   pages  $ git push -u origin master  63https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref settings allowed-hosts   Chapter 3: Pages App  Deployment  51  The last step is to actually deploy with Heroku. If you’ve ever configured a server yourself in the past, you’ll be amazed at how much simpler the process is with a platform-as-a-service provider like Heroku.  Our process will be as follows:    create a new app on Heroku    disable the collection of static files  we’ll cover this in a later chapter     push the code up to Heroku    start the Heroku server so the app is live    visit the app on Heroku’s provided URL  We can do the first step, creating a new Heroku app, from the command line with heroku create. Heroku will create a random name for our app, in my case fathomless-hamlet-26076. Your name will be different.  Command Line   pages  $ heroku create Creating app... done, ￿ fathomless-hamlet-26076 https:  fathomless-hamlet-26076.herokuapp.com   https:  git.heroku.com fathomless-hamlet-26076.git  We only need to do one set of Heroku configurations at this point, which is to tell Heroku to ignore static files like CSS and JavaScript which Django by default tries to optimize for us. We’ll cover this in later chapters so for now just run the following command:  Command Line   pages  $ heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1  Now we can push our code to Heroku.   Chapter 3: Pages App  52  Command Line   pages  $ git push heroku master  If we had just typed git push origin master, then the code would have been pushed to GitHub, not Heroku. Adding heroku to the command sends the code to Heroku. This is a little confusing the first few times.  Finally, we need to make our Heroku app live. As websites grow in traffic they need additional Heroku services but for our basic example we can use the lowest level, web=1, which also happens to be free! Type the following command:  Command Line   pages  $ heroku ps:scale web=1  Command Line   pages  $ heroku open  We’re done! The last step is to confirm our app is live and online. If you use the command heroku open your web browser will open a new tab with the URL of your app:  Mine is at https:  fathomless-hamlet-26076.herokuapp.com .  Homepage on Heroku  You do not have to log out or exit from your Heroku app. It will continue running at this free tier on its own, though you should type exit to leave the local virtual environment and be ready for the next chapter.   Chapter 3: Pages App  Conclusion  53  Congratulations on building and deploying your second Django project! This time we used templates, class-based views, explored URLConfs more fully, added basic tests, and used Heroku. Next up we’ll move on to our first database-backed project, a Message Board website, and see where Django really shines.   Chapter 4: Message Board App  In this chapter we will use a database for the first time to build a basic Message Board application where users can post and read short messages. We’ll explore Django’s powerful built-in admin interface which provides a visual way to make changes to our data. And after adding tests we will push our code to GitHub and deploy the app on Heroku.  Thanks to the powerful Django ORM  Object-Relational Mapper , there is built-in support for multiple database backends: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, or SQLite. This means that we, as developers, can write the same Python code in a models.py file and it will automatically be translated into each database correctly. The only configuration required is to update the DATABASES64 section of our config settings.py file. This is truly an impressive feature!  For local development, Django defaults to using SQLite65 because it is file-based and therefore far simpler to use than the other database options, which require a dedicated server to be running separate from Django itself.  Initial Set Up  Since we’ve already set up several Django projects at this point in the book, we can quickly run through the standard commands to begin a new one. We need to do the following:    create a new directory for our code on the Desktop called mb   install Django in a new virtual environment   create a new project called config   create a new app call posts   update config settings.py  In a new command line console, enter the following commands:  64https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref databases  65https:  www.sqlite.org    Chapter 4: Message Board App  55  Next we must alert Django to the new app, posts, by adding it to the top of the INSTALLED_APPS section of our config settings.py file.  Command Line  $ cd ~ Desktop $ mkdir mb && cd mb $ pipenv install django~=3.1.0 $ pipenv shell  mb  $ django-admin startproject config .  mb  $ python manage.py startapp posts  Code   config settings.py INSTALLED_APPS = [  'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'posts',  new  ]  Command Line   mb  $ python manage.py migrate  66https:  www.sqlite.org   Then execute the migrate command to create an initial database based on Django’s default settings.  If you look inside our directory with the ls command, you’ll see there’s now a db.sqlite3 file representing our SQLite66 database.   Chapter 4: Message Board App  56  Command Line   mb  $ ls Pipfile  Pipfile.lock  config  db.sqlite3  manage.py  posts  Technically, a db.sqlite3 file is created the first time you run either migrate or runserver, however migrate will sync the database with the current state of any database models con- tained in the project and listed in INSTALLED_APPS. In other words, to make sure the database reflects the current state of your project you’ll need to run migrate  and also makemigrations  each time you update a model. More on this shortly.  To confirm everything works correctly, spin up our local server.  Command Line   mb  $ python manage.py runserver  In your web browser, navigate to http:  127.0.0.1:8000  to see the familiar Django welcome page.   Chapter 4: Message Board App  57  Django welcome page  Create a database model  Our first task is to create a database model where we can store and display posts from our users. Django’s ORM will automatically turn this model into a database table for us. In a real-world   Chapter 4: Message Board App  58  Django project, there are often many complex, interconnected database models but in our simple message board app we only need one.  I won’t cover database design in this book but I have written a short guide which you can find here67 if this is all new to you.  Open the posts models.py file and look at the default code which Django provides:  Django imports a module, models, to help us build new database models, which will “model” the characteristics of the data in our database. We want to create a model to store the textual content of a message board post, which we can do as follows:  Code  posts models.py from django.db import models   Create your models here  Code  posts models.py from django.db import models  class Post models.Model :  text = models.TextField    Note that we’ve created a new database model called Post which has the database field text. We’ve also specified the type of content it will hold, TextField  . Django provides many model fields68 supporting common types of content such as characters, dates, integers, emails, and so on.  Activating models  Now that our new model is created we need to activate it. Going forward, whenever we create or modify an existing model we’ll need to update Django in a two-step process:  67https:  learndjango.com tutorials database-design-tutorial-beginners 68https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref models fields    Chapter 4: Message Board App  59  1. First, we create a migrations file with the makemigrations command. Migration files create a reference of any changes to the database models which means we can track changes–and debug errors as necessary–over time.  2. Second, we build the actual database with the migrate command which executes the  instructions in our migrations file.  Make sure the local server is stopped by typing Control+c on the command line and then run the commands python manage.py makemigrations posts and python manage.py migrate.  Command Line   mb  $ python manage.py makemigrations posts Migrations for 'posts':  posts migrations 0001_initial.py  - Create model Post   mb  $ python manage.py migrate Operations to perform:  Running migrations:  Applying posts.0001_initial... OK  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, posts, sessions  Note that you don’t have to include a name after makemigrations. If you simply run python manage.py makemigrations, a migrations file will be created for all available changes throughout the Django project. That is fine in a small project such as ours with only a single app, but most Django projects have more than one app! Therefore ,if you made model changes in multiple apps the resulting migrations file would include all those changes! This is not ideal. Migrations file should be as small and concise as possible as this makes it easier to debug in the future or even roll back changes as needed. Therefore, as a best practice, adopt the habit of always including the name of an app when executing the makemigrations command!  Django Admin  One of Django’s killer features is its robust built-in admin interface that provides a visual way to interact with data. It came about because Django was originally built69 as a newspaper CMS  69https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 faq general    Chapter 4: Message Board App  60   Content Management System . The idea was that journalists could write and edit their stories in the admin without needing to touch “code.” Over time, the built-in admin app has evolved into a fantastic, out-of-the-box tool for managing all aspects of a Django project.  To use the Django admin, we first need to create a superuser who can log in. In your command line console, type python manage.py createsuperuser and respond to the prompts for a username, email, and password:  Command Line   mb  $ python manage.py createsuperuser Username  leave blank to use 'wsv' : wsv Email: will@learndjango.com Password: Password  again : Superuser created successfully.  When you type your password, it will not appear visible in the command line console for security reasons.  Restart the Django server with python manage.py runserver and in your web browser go to http:  127.0.0.1:8000 admin . You should see the log in screen for the admin:   Chapter 4: Message Board App  61  Admin login page  Log in by entering the username and password you just created. You will see the Django admin homepage next:  Admin homepage  But where is our posts app? It’s not displayed on the main admin page!  Just as we must explicitly add new apps to the INSTALLED_APPS config, so, too, must we update an app’s admin.py file for it to appear in the admin.  In your text editor open up posts admin.py and add the following code so that the Post model   Chapter 4: Message Board App  62  is displayed.  Code   posts admin.py from django.contrib import admin  from .models import Post  admin.site.register Post   Django now knows that it should display our posts app and its database model Post on the admin page. If you refresh your browser you’ll see that it appears:  Admin homepage updated  Let’s create our first message board post for our database. Click on the + Add button opposite Posts and enter your own content in the Text form field.   Chapter 4: Message Board App  63  Admin new entry  Then click the “Save” button, which will redirect you to the main Post page. However if you look closely, there’s a problem: our new entry is called “Post object,” which isn’t very descriptive!  Let’s change that. Within the posts models.py file, add a new function __str__ as follows:  Admin new entry   Chapter 4: Message Board App  64  Code   posts models.py from django.db import models  class Post models.Model :  text = models.TextField    def __str__ self :  return self.text[:50]  This will display the first 50 characters of the text field. If you refresh your Admin page in the browser, you’ll see it’s changed to a much more descriptive and helpful representation of our database entry.  Admin new entry  Much better! It’s a best practice to add str   methods to all of your models to improve their readability.  Views Templates URLs  In order to display our database content on our homepage, we have to wire up our views, templates, and URLConfs. This pattern should start to feel familiar now.   Chapter 4: Message Board App  65  Let’s begin with the view. Earlier in the book we used the built-in generic TemplateView70 to display a template file on our homepage. Now we want to list the contents of our database model. Fortunately this is also a common task in web development and Django comes equipped with the generic class-based ListView71.  In the posts views.py file enter the Python code below:  Code   posts views.py from django.views.generic import ListView from .models import Post  class HomePageView ListView :  model = Post template_name = 'home.html'  On the first line we’re importing ListView and in the second line we import the Post model. In the view, HomePageView, we subclass ListView and specify the correct model and template.  Our view is complete which means we still need to configure our URLs and make our template. Let’s start with the template. Create a new directory called templates and within it a home.html template file.  Command Line   mb  $ mkdir templates  mb  $ touch templates home.html  Then update the DIRS field in our config settings.py file so that Django knows to look in this templates directory.  70https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref class-based-views base django.views.generic.base.  TemplateView  71https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref class-based-views generic-display listview   66  Chapter 4: Message Board App  Code   config settings.py TEMPLATES = [  {  },  ]  ... 'DIRS': [str BASE_DIR.joinpath 'templates'  ],  new ...  ListView automatically returns to us a context variable called object_list that we can loop over via the built-in for72 template tag. We’ll create our own variable called post and can then access the desired field we want displayed, text, as post.text.  Code     Message board homepage     {% for post in object_list %}   {{ post.text }}   {% endfor %}     The name object_list isn’t very friendly, is it? Instead we can provide an explicit name via context_object_name73 attribute. Django is, as ever, eminently customizable.  Back in our posts views.py file add the following:  72https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref templates builtins std:templatetag-for 73https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics class-based-views generic-display making-friendly-  template-contexts   Chapter 4: Message Board App  67  Code   posts views.py from django.views.generic import ListView from .models import Post  class HomePageView ListView :  model = Post template_name = 'home.html' context_object_name = 'all_posts_list'  new  Adding an explicit name in this way makes it easier for other members of a team, for example a designer, to understand and reason about what is available in the template context.  Don’t forget to update our template, too, so that it references all_posts_list rather than object_list.  Code     Message board homepage     {% for post in all_posts_list %}   {{ post.text }}   {% endfor %}     The last step is to set up our URLConfs. Let’s start with the config urls.py file where we include our posts app and add include on the second line.   Chapter 4: Message Board App  68  Code  config urls.py from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import path, include  new  urlpatterns = [  path 'admin ', admin.site.urls , path '', include 'posts.urls'  ,  new  Then create a urls.py file within the posts app.  Command Line  mb  $ touch posts urls.py  And update it like so:  Code  posts urls.py from django.urls import path from .views import HomePageView  ]  ]  urlpatterns = [  path '', HomePageView.as_view  , name='home' ,  Restart the server with python manage.py runserver and navigate to our homepage, which now lists out our message board post.  Homepage with posts  We’re basically done at this point, but let’s create a few more message board posts in the Django admin to confirm that they will display correctly on the homepage.   Chapter 4: Message Board App  Adding New Posts  69  To add new posts to our message board, go back into the Admin and create two more posts. Here’s what mine look like:  If you return to the homepage you’ll see it automatically displays our formatted posts. Woohoo!  Updated admin entries section  Homepage with three entries  Everything works so it’s a good time to initialize our directory, add the new code, and include our first git commit.   Chapter 4: Message Board App  70  Command Line   mb  $ git init  mb  $ git add -A  mb  $ git commit -m "initial commit"  Tests  Previously, we were only testing static pages so we used SimpleTestCase74. But now that our homepage works with a database, we need to use TestCase75, which will let us create a “test” database we can check against. In other words, we don’t need to run tests on our actual database but instead can make a separate test database, fill it with sample data, and then test against that which is a must safer and more performant approach.  Let’s start by adding a sample post to the text database field and then check that it is stored correctly in the database. It’s important that all our test methods start with the phrase test_ so that Django knows to test them! The code will look like this:  Code   posts tests.py from django.test import TestCase from .models import Post  class PostModelTest TestCase :  def setUp self :  Post.objects.create text='just a test'   def test_text_content self :  post=Post.objects.get id=1  expected_object_name = f'{post.text}' self.assertEqual expected_object_name, 'just a test'   74https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics testing tools django.test.SimpleTestCase 75https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics testing tools django.test.TestCase   Chapter 4: Message Board App  71  At the top we imported the TestCase module which lets us create a sample database and our Post model. We created a new class, PostModelTest, and added a setUp method to create a new database that has just one entry: a post with a text field containing the string ‘just a test.’  Then we can run our first test, test_text_content, to check that the database field actually contains just a test. We created a variable called post that represents the first id on our Post model.  Remember that Django automatically sets this id for us. If we created another entry it would have an id of 2, the next one would be 3, and so on.  The next line uses f strings76, a very cool addition to Python 3.6, which let us put variables directly in our strings as long as the variables are surrounded by brackets {}. Here we’re setting expected_object_name to be the string of the value in post.text, which should be just a test.  On the final line we use assertEqual77 to check that our newly created entry does in fact match what we input at the top. Go ahead and run the test on the command line with command python manage.py test.  Command Line   mb  $ python manage.py test Creating test database for alias 'default'... System check identified no issues  0 silenced . . ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ran 1 test in 0.001s  OK Destroying test database for alias 'default'...  It passed! Don’t worry if the previous explanation felt like information overload. That’s natural the first time you start writing tests, but you’ll soon find that most tests you write are actually quite repetitive.  76https:  www.python.org dev peps pep-0498  77https:  docs.python.org 3.8 library unittest.htmlunittest.TestCase.assertEqual   Chapter 4: Message Board App  72  Time for our next group of tests. The first test looked at the model but now we want evaluate the homepage itself:    does it actually exist and return a HTTP 200 response?   does it use HomePageView as the view?   does it use home.html as the template?  We can include all of these tests in a new class called HomePageViewTest. Note that rather than access the view name directly we will instead import reverse78 and refer to the named URL of home. Why do it this way? URL schemes can and do change over the course of a project, but the named URL likely will not so this is a way to future-proof your tests.  We’ll need to add one more import at the top for reverse and a brand new class HomePageViewTest for our test.  Code   posts tests.py from django.test import TestCase from django.urls import reverse  new from .models import Post  class PostModelTest TestCase :  ...  class HomePageViewTest TestCase :  new  def setUp self :  Post.objects.create text='this is another test'   def test_view_url_exists_at_proper_location self :  resp = self.client.get ' '  self.assertEqual resp.status_code, 200   def test_view_url_by_name self :  resp = self.client.get reverse 'home'   self.assertEqual resp.status_code, 200   def test_view_uses_correct_template self :  78https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref urlresolvers reverse   Chapter 4: Message Board App  73  resp = self.client.get reverse 'home'   self.assertEqual resp.status_code, 200  self.assertTemplateUsed resp, 'home.html'   If you run our tests again you should see that they pass.  Command Line  mb  $ python manage.py test Creating test database for alias 'default'... System check identified no issues  0 silenced . . ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ran 4 tests in 0.015s  OK Destroying test database for alias 'default'...  Why does the output say four tests and not six? The answer is that our setUp methods are not actually tests, they are helper functions. Only functions that start with the name test* and exist in a tests.py file will be run as tests when we execute the python manage.py test command.  We’re done adding code for our testing so it’s time to commit the changes to git.  Command Line  mb  $ git add -A  mb  $ git commit -m "added tests"  GitHub  We also need to store our code on GitHub. You should already have a GitHub account from previous chapters so go ahead and create a new repo called mb-app. Select the “Private” radio button.  On the next page scroll down to where it says “â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line.” Copy and paste the two commands there into your terminal, which should look like like the below after replacing wsvincent  my username  with your GitHub username:   Chapter 4: Message Board App  74  Command Line  mb  $ git remote add origin https:  github.com wsvincent mb-app.git  mb  $ git push -u origin master  Heroku Configuration  You should already have a Heroku account set up and installed from Chapter 3. Our deployment checklist contains the same three items:    install Gunicorn   add a Procfile   update ALLOWED_HOSTS  Gunicorn can be installed via Pipenv.  Command Line  mb  $ pipenv install gunicorn==19.9.0  Then create a Procfile with Heroku instructions.  Command Line  mb  $ touch Procfile  Add one line instructing Heroku to use Gunicorn as our production web server.  Procfile web: gunicorn config.wsgi --log-file -  Previously, we set ALLOWED_HOSTS to *, meaning accept all hosts, but that was a dangerous shortcut. We can, and should be, more specific. The two local hosts Django runs on are localhost:8000 and 127.0.0.1:8000. We also know, having deployed on Heroku previously, that any Heroku site will end with .herokuapp.com. We can add all three routes to our config.   Chapter 4: Message Board App  Code   config settings.py ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['.herokuapp.com', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1']  75  We’re all done! Add and commit our new changes to git and then push them up to GitHub.  Command Line   mb  $ git status  mb  $ git add -A  mb  $ git commit -m "New updates for Heroku deployment"  mb  $ git push -u origin master  Make sure you’re logged into your correct Heroku account.  Heroku Deployment  Command Line   mb  $ heroku login  Then run the create command and Heroku will randomly generate an app name.  Command Line   mb  $ heroku create Creating app... done, â¬¢ sleepy-brook-64719 https:  sleepy-brook-64719.herokuapp.com   https:  git.heroku.com sleepy-brook-64719.git  For now, continue to instruct Heroku to ignore static files. We’ll cover them in the next section while deploying our Blog app.   Chapter 4: Message Board App  Command Line   mb  $ heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1  76  Push the code to Heroku and add free scaling so it’s actually running online, otherwise the code is just sitting there!  Command Line   mb  $ git push heroku master  mb  $ heroku ps:scale web=1  You can open the URL of the new project from the command line by typing heroku open which will launch a new browser window. For example, mine can be seen below:  To finish up, exit our virtual environment by typing exit on the command line.  Live site  Conclusion  We’ve now built, tested, and deployed our first database-driven app. While it’s deliberately quite basic, we learned how to create a database model, update it with the admin panel, and then display the contents on a web page. That’s the good news. The bad news is that if you check your Heroku site in a few days, it’s likely whatever posts you’ve added will be deleted! This is related to how Heroku handles SQLite, but really it’s an indication that we should be using a production database like PostgreSQL for deployments, even if we still want to stick with SQLite locally. This is covered in Chapter 16!   Chapter 4: Message Board App  77  In the next section, we’ll learn how to deploy with PostgreSQL and build a Blog application so that users can create, edit, and delete posts on their own. No admin access required! We’ll also add styling via CSS so the site looks better.   Chapter 5: Blog App  In this chapter we willll build a Blog application that allows users to create, edit, and delete posts. The homepage will list all blog posts and there will be a dedicated detail page for each individual blog post. We’ll also introduce CSS for styling and learn how Django works with static files.  Initial Set Up  As covered in previous chapters, our steps for setting up a new Django project are as follows:    create a new directory for our code on the Desktop called blog    install Django in a new virtual environment   create a new Django project called config   create a new app blog    perform a migration to set up the database   update config settings.py  Command Line  $ cd ~ Desktop $ mkdir blog $ cd blog $ pipenv install django~=3.1.0 $ pipenv shell  blog  $ django-admin startproject config .  blog  $ python manage.py startapp blog  blog  $ python manage.py migrate  blog  $ python manage.py runserver  To ensure Django knows about our new app, open your text editor and add the new app to INSTALLED_APPS in our config settings.py file:   79  Chapter 5: Blog App  Code   config settings.py INSTALLED_APPS =  'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'blog',  new  ]  If you navigate to http:  127.0.0.1:8000  in your browser you should see Django welcome page.   Chapter 5: Blog App  80  Ok, initial installation complete! Next we’ll create our database model for blog posts.  Django welcome page   Chapter 5: Blog App  Database Models  81  What are the characteristics of a typical blog application? In our case, let’s keep things simple and assume each post has a title, author, and body. We can turn this into a database model by opening the blog models.py file and entering the code below:  Code   blog models.py from django.db import models  class Post models.Model :  title = models.CharField max_length=200  author = models.ForeignKey   'auth.User', on_delete=models.CASCADE,    body = models.TextField    def __str__ self :  return self.title  At the top, we’re importing the class models and then creating a subclass of models.Model called Post. Using this subclass functionality we automatically have access to everything within django.db.models.Models79 and can add additional fields and methods as desired.  For title we’re limiting the length to 200 characters and for body we’re using a TextField which will automatically expand as needed to fit the user’s text. There are many field types available in Django; you can see the full list here80.  For the author field we’re using a ForeignKey81 which allows for a many-to-one relationship. This means that a given user can be the author of many different blog posts but not the other way around. The reference is to the built-in User model that Django provides for authentication. For all many-to-one relationships such as a ForeignKey we must also specify an on_delete82 option.  79https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics db models  80https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics db models fields 81https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref models fields django.db.models.ForeignKey 82https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref models fields django.db.models.ForeignKey.on_delete   Chapter 5: Blog App  82  Now that our new database model is created we need to create a new migration record for it and migrate the change into our database. Stop the server with Control+c. This two-step process can be completed with the commands below:  Command Line   blog  $ python manage.py makemigrations blog  blog  $ python manage.py migrate blog  Our database is configured! What’s next?  Admin  Command Line   blog  $ python manage.py createsuperuser Username  leave blank to use 'wsv' : wsv Email: Password: Password  again : Superuser created successfully.  We need a way to access our data. Enter the Django admin! First, create a superuser account by typing the command below and following the prompts to set up an email and password. Note that when typing your password, it will not appear on the screen for security reasons.  Now start running the Django server again with the command python manage.py runserver and navigate over to the admin at 127.0.0.1:8000 admin . Log in with your new superuser account.  Oops! Where’s our new Post model?   Chapter 5: Blog App  83  We forgot to update blog admin.py so let’s do that now.  Admin homepage  Code   blog admin.py from django.contrib import admin from .models import Post  admin.site.register Post   If you refresh the page you’ll see the update.  Admin homepage   Chapter 5: Blog App  84  Let’s add two blog posts so we have some sample data to work with. Click on the + Add button next to Posts to create a new entry. Make sure to add an “author” to each post too since by default all model fields are required.  Admin first post   Chapter 5: Blog App  85  Admin second post  If you try to enter a post without an author you will see an error. If we wanted to change this, we could add field options83 to our model to make a given field optional or fill it with a default value.  83https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref models fields field-options   Chapter 5: Blog App  86  Admin homepage with two posts  Now that our database model is complete we need to create the necessary views, URLs, and templates so we can display the information on our web application.  URLs  We want to display our blog posts on the homepage so, as in previous chapters, we’ll first configure our config urls.py file and then our app-level blog urls.py file to achieve this.  On the command line quit the existing server with Control+c and create a new urls.py file within our blog:  Command Line   blog  $ touch blog urls.py  Now update it with the code below.   Chapter 5: Blog App  87  Code  blog urls.py from django.urls import path from .views import BlogListView  urlpatterns = [  path '', BlogListView.as_view  , name='home' ,  We’re importing our soon-to-be-created views at the top. The empty string, '', tells Python to match all values and we make it a named URL, home, which we can refer to in our views later on. While it’s optional to add a named URL84 it’s a best practice you should adopt as it helps keep things organized as your number of URLs grows.  We also should update our config urls.py file so that it knows to forward all requests directly to the blog app.  Code  config urls.py from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import path, include  new  urlpatterns = [  path 'admin ', admin.site.urls , path '', include 'blog.urls'  ,  new  We’ve added include on the second line and a URLpattern using an empty string regular expression, '', indicating that URL requests should be redirected as is to blog’s URLs for further instructions.  ]  ]  Views  We’re going to use class-based views but if you want to see a function-based way to build a blog application, I highly recommend the Django Girls Tutorial85. It is excellent.  84https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics http urls reverse-resolution-of-urls 85https:  tutorial.djangogirls.org en    Chapter 5: Blog App  88  In our views file, add the code below to display the contents of our Post model using ListView.  Code   blog views.py from django.views.generic import ListView from .models import Post  class BlogListView ListView :  model = Post template_name = 'home.html'  On the top two lines we import ListView86 and our database model Post. Then we subclass ListView and add links to our model and template. This saves us a lot of code versus imple- menting it all from scratch.  Templates  With our URLConfs and views now complete, we’re only missing the third piece of the puzzle: templates. As we already saw in Chapter 4, we can inherit from other templates to keep our code clean. Thus we’ll start off with a base.html file and a home.html file that inherits from it. Then later when we add templates for creating and editing blog posts, they too can inherit from base.html.  Start by creating our new templates directory with the two template files.  Command Line   blog  $ mkdir templates  blog  $ touch templates base.html  blog  $ touch templates home.html  Then update config settings.py so Django knows to look there for our templates.  86https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref class-based-views generic-display listview   89  Chapter 5: Blog App  Code   config settings.py TEMPLATES = [  {  },  ]  Code                          ... 'DIRS': [str BASE_DIR.joinpath 'templates'  ],  new ...  Then update the base.html template as follows.        Django blog     Django blog    {% block content %} {% endblock content %}  Note that code between {% block content %} and {% endblock content %} can be filled by other templates. Speaking of which, here is the code for home.html.   Chapter 5: Blog App  90  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block content %}  {% for post in object_list %}       {{ post.title }}    {{ post.body }}      {% endfor %}  {% endblock content %}  At the top, we note that this template extends base.html and then wrap our desired code with content blocks. We use the Django Templating Language to set up a simple for loop for each blog post. Note that object_list comes from ListView and contains all the objects in our view.  If you start the Django server again with python manage.py runserver and refresh the homepage we can see it is working.  Blog homepage with two posts  But it looks terrible. Let’s fix that!  Static Files  We need to add some CSS to our project to improve the styling. CSS, JavaScript, and images are a core piece of any modern web application and within the Django world are referred to as “static   Chapter 5: Blog App  91  files.” Django provides tremendous flexibility around how these files are used, but this can lead to quite a lot of confusion for newcomers.  By default, Django will look within each app for a folder called static. In other words, a folder called blog static . If you recall, this is similar to how templates are treated as well.  As Django projects grow in complexity over time and have multiple apps, it is often simpler to reason about static files if they are stored in a single, project-level directory instead. That is the approach we will take here.  Quit the local server with Control+c and create a new directory called static in the same folder as the manage.py file.  Then we need to tell Django to look for this new folder when loading static files. If you look at the bottom of the config settings.py file, there is already a single line of configuration:  Command Line   blog  $ mkdir static  Code   config settings.py STATIC_URL = ' static '  STATIC_URL87 is the URL location of static files in our project, aka at  static .  By configuring STATICFILES_DIRS88, we can tell Django where to look for static files beyond just app static folder. In your config settings.py file, at the bottom, add the following new line which tells Django to look within our newly-created static folder for static files.  87https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref settings std:setting-STATIC_URL 88https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref settings staticfiles-dirs   92  Chapter 5: Blog App  Code   config settings.py STATIC_URL = ' static ' STATICFILES_DIRS = [str BASE_DIR.joinpath 'static'  ]  new  Next create a css directory within static and add a new base.css file in it.  Command Line   blog  $ mkdir static css  blog  $ touch static css base.css  What should we put in our file? How about changing the title to be red?   * static css base.css *  header h1 a { color: red;  Code  }  Code  Last step now. We need to add the static files to our templates by adding {% load static %} to the top of base.html. Because our other templates inherit from base.html, we only have to add this once. Include a new line at the bottom of the    code that explicitly references our new base.css file.    {% load static %}         ...   Django blog     Phew! That was a bit of a pain but it’s a one-time hassle. Now we can add static files to our static directory and they’ll automatically appear in all our templates.   Chapter 5: Blog App  93  Start up the server again with python manage.py runserver and look at our updated homepage at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 .  Blog homepage with red title  We can do a little better though. How about if we add a custom font and some more CSS? Since this book is not a tutorial on CSS simply insert the following between    tags to add Source Sans Pro89, a free font from Google.  Code    {% load static %}      t">     ...   Django blog  <link href="https:  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:400" rel="styleshee\     Then update our css file by copy and pasting the following code:  89https:  fonts.google.com specimen Source+Sans+Pro   94  Chapter 5: Blog App  Code  * static css base.css *  body {  font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; font-size: 18px;  header {  border-bottom: 1px solid 999; margin-bottom: 2rem; display: flex;  }  }  }  }  }  }  }  }  }  header h1 a { color: red; text-decoration: none;  .nav-left {  margin-right: auto;  .nav-right {  display: flex; padding-top: 2rem;  .post-entry {  margin-bottom: 2rem;  .post-entry h2 {  margin: 0.5rem 0;  .post-entry h2 a, .post-entry h2 a:visited {  color: blue; text-decoration: none;  .post-entry p {  margin: 0; font-weight: 400;   Chapter 5: Blog App  95  .post-entry h2 a:hover {  color: red;  }  Refresh the homepage at http:  127.0.0.1:8000  and you should see the following.  Blog homepage with CSS  Individual Blog Pages  Now we can add the functionality for individual blog pages. How do we do that? We need to create a new view, url, and template. I hope you’re noticing a pattern in development with Django now!  Start with the view. We can use the generic class-based DetailView90 to simplify things. At the top of the file, add DetailView to the list of imports and then create our new view called BlogDetailView.  90https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref class-based-views generic-display django.views.generic.detail.  DetailView   Chapter 5: Blog App  Code   blog views.py from django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView  new from .models import Post  96  class BlogListView ListView :  model = Post template_name = 'home.html'  class BlogDetailView DetailView :  new  model = Post template_name = 'post_detail.html'  In this new view, we define the model we’re using, Post, and the template we want it associated with, post_detail.html. By default, DetailView will provide a context object we can use in our template called either object or the lowercased name of our model, which would be post. Also, DetailView expects either a primary key or a slug passed to it as the identifier. More on this shortly.  Now exit the local server Control+c and create our new template for a post detail as follows:  Command Line   blog  $ touch templates post_detail.html  Then type in the following code:   Chapter 5: Blog App  97  Code   {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block content %}      {{ post.title }}   {{ post.body }}      {% endblock content %}  Code   {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block content %}      {{ object.title }}   {{ object.body }}      {% endblock content %}  At the top we specify that this template inherits from base.html. Then display the title and body from our context object, which DetailView makes accessible as post.  Personally, I found the naming of context objects in generic views extremely confusing when first learning Django. Because our context object from DetailView is either our model name post or object we could also update our template as follows and it would work exactly the same.  If you find using post or object confusing, it’s possible to explicitly name the context object in our view using context_object_name91.  The “magic” naming of the context object is a price you pay for the ease and simplicity of using generic views, which are great if you know what they’re doing but take a little research in the official documentation to customize.  Ok, what’s next? How about adding a new URLConf for our view, which we can do as follows.  91https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics class-based-views generic-display making-friendly-  template-contexts   Chapter 5: Blog App  98  Code  ]   blog urls.py from django.urls import path from .views import BlogListView, BlogDetailView  new  urlpatterns = [  path 'post   ', BlogDetailView.as_view  ,  name='post_detail' ,  new  path '', BlogListView.as_view  , name='home' ,  All blog post entries will start with post . Next is the primary key for our post entry which will be represented as an integer  . What’s the primary key you’re probably asking? Django automatically adds an auto-incrementing primary key92 to our database models. So while we only declared the fields title, author, and body on our Post model, under-the-hood Django also added another field called id, which is our primary key. We can access it as either id or pk.  The pk for our first “Hello, World” post is 1. For the second post, it is 2. And so on. Therefore when we go to the individual entry page for our first post, we can expect that its urlpattern will be post 1 .  Understanding how primary keys work with DetailView is a very common place of confusion for beginners. It’s worth re-reading the previous two paragraphs a few times if it doesn’t click. With practice it will become second nature.  If you now start up the server with python manage.py runserver you’ll see a dedicated page for our first blog post at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 post 1 .  92https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics db models automatic-primary-key-fields   Chapter 5: Blog App  99  Blog post one detail  Woohoo! You can also go to http:  127.0.0.1:8000 post 2  to see the second entry.  To make our life easier, we should update the link on the homepage so we can directly access individual blog posts from there. Currently, in home.html our link is empty:  . Update it to  .  Code   {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block content %}  {% for post in object_list %}      {% endfor %}  {% endblock content %}    {{ post.title }}    {{ post.body }}   We start off by telling our Django template we want to reference a URLConf by using the code {% url ... %}. Which URL? The one named post_detail, which is the name we gave BlogDetailView in our URLConf just a moment ago. If we look at post_detail in our URLConf, we see that it expects to be passed an argument pk representing the primary key for the blog post. Fortunately, Django has already created and included this pk field on our post object. We pass it into the URLConf by adding it in the template as post.pk.  To confirm everything works, refresh the main page at http:  127.0.0.1:8000  and click on the title of each blog post to confirm the new links work.   Chapter 5: Blog App  Tests  100  We need to test our model and views now. We want to ensure that the Post model works as expected, including its str representation. And we want to test both ListView and DetailView.  Here’s what sample tests look like in the blog tests.py file.  Code   blog tests.py from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model from django.test import TestCase from django.urls import reverse  from .models import Post  class BlogTests TestCase :  def setUp self :  self.user = get_user_model  .objects.create_user   username='testuser', email='test@email.com', password='secret'        self.post = Post.objects.create   title='A good title', body='Nice body content', author=self.user,  def test_string_representation self :  post = Post title='A sample title'  self.assertEqual str post , post.title   def test_post_content self :  self.assertEqual f'{self.post.title}', 'A good title'  self.assertEqual f'{self.post.author}', 'testuser'  self.assertEqual f'{self.post.body}', 'Nice body content'   def test_post_list_view self :  response = self.client.get reverse 'home'   self.assertEqual response.status_code, 200    Chapter 5: Blog App  101  self.assertContains response, 'Nice body content'  self.assertTemplateUsed response, 'home.html'   def test_post_detail_view self :  response = self.client.get ' post 1 '  no_response = self.client.get ' post 100000 '  self.assertEqual response.status_code, 200  self.assertEqual no_response.status_code, 404  self.assertContains response, 'A good title'  self.assertTemplateUsed response, 'post_detail.html'   There’s a lot that’s new in these tests so we’ll walk through them slowly. At the top we import both get_user_model93 to reference our active User and TestCase which we’ve seen before.  In our setUp method we add a sample blog post to test and then confirm that both its string representation and content are correct. Then we use test_post_list_view to confirm that our homepage returns a 200 HTTP status code, contains our body text, and uses the correct home.html template. Finally test_post_detail_view tests that our detail page works as expected and that an incorrect page returns a 404. It’s always good to both test that something does exist and that something incorrect doesn’t exist in your tests.  Go ahead and run these tests now. They should all pass.  Command Line   blog  $ python manage.py test  Git  Now is also a good time for our first Git commit. First, initialize our directory.  93https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth customizing django.contrib.auth.get_user_model   102  Then review all the content we’ve added by checking the status. Add all new files. And make our first commit.  Chapter 5: Blog App  Command Line   blog  $ git init  Command Line   blog  $ git status  blog  $ git add -A  blog  $ git commit -m "initial commit"  Conclusion  We’ve now built a basic blog application from scratch! Using the Django admin we can create, edit, or delete the content. And we used DetailView for the first time to create a detailed individual view of each blog post entry.  In the next section, Chapter 6: Blog app with forms, we’ll add forms so we don’t have to use the Django admin at all for these changes.   Chapter 6: Forms  Forms  In this chapter we’ll continue working on our Blog application from Chapter 5 by adding forms so a user can create, edit, or delete any of their blog entries.  Forms are a ubiquitous part of the modern web but they are very complicated to implement correctly. Any time you accept user input there are security concerns  XSS Attacks94 , proper error handling is required, and there are UI considerations around how to alert the user to problems with the form.  Fortunately for us, Django’s built-in Forms95 abstract away much of the difficulty and provide a rich set of tools to handle common use cases working with forms.  To start, update our base template to display a link to a page for entering new blog posts. It will take the form    where post_new is the name for our URL.  Your updated file should look as follows:  94https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Cross-site_scripting 95https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics forms    104  Chapter 6: Forms  Code    {% load static %}        Django blog  <link href="https:  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=\ Source+Sans+Pro:400" rel="stylesheet">      Django blog     + New Blog Post                  {% block content %} {% endblock content %}  Let’s add a new URLConf for post_new now. Import our not-yet-created view called BlogCreateView at the top. And then make the URL which will start with post new  and be named post_new.   blog urls.py from django.urls import path from .views import BlogListView, BlogDetailView, BlogCreateView  new  urlpatterns = [  path 'post new ', BlogCreateView.as_view  , name='post_new' ,  new path 'post   ', BlogDetailView.as_view  , name='post_detail' , path '', BlogListView.as_view  , name='home' ,  Simple, right? It’s the same url, views, template pattern we’ve seen before.                 Code  ]   Chapter 6: Forms  105  Now let’s create our view by importing a new generic class called CreateView at the top and then subclass it to create a new view called BlogCreateView.  Code   blog views.py from django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView  new from .models import Post  class BlogListView ListView :  model = Post template_name = 'home.html'  class BlogDetailView DetailView :  model = Post template_name = 'post_detail.html'  class BlogCreateView CreateView :  new  model = Post template_name = 'post_new.html' fields = ['title', 'author', 'body']  Within BlogCreateView we specify our database model Post, the name of our template post_- new.html. For fields we explicitly set the database fields we want to expose which are title, author, and body.  The last step is to create our template, which we will call post_new.html.  Command Line   blog  $ touch templates post_new.html  And then add the following code:   106  Chapter 6: Forms  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block content %}   New post   {% csrf_token %}  {{ form.as_p }}       {% endblock content %}  Let’s breakdown what we’ve done:    On the top line we inherit from our base template.   Use HTML   tags with the POST method since we’re sending data. If we were  receiving data from a form, for example in a search box, we would use GET.    Add a {% csrf_token %}96 which Django provides to protect our form from cross-site  request forgery. You should use it for all your Django forms.    Then to output our form data we use {{ form.as_p }} which renders it within paragraph    tags.    Finally, specify an input type of submit and assign it the value “Save”.  To view our work, start the server with python manage.py runserver and go to the homepage at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 .  96https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref csrf    Chapter 6: Forms  107  Homepage with new button  Click the “+ New Blog Post” link in the upper righthand corner. It will redirect to web page at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 post new .  Go ahead and try to create a new blog post and submit it.  Blog new page   Chapter 6: Forms  108  Oops! What happened?  Blog new page   Chapter 6: Forms  109  Blog new page  Django’s error message is quite helpful. It’s complaining that we did not specify where to send the user after successfully submitting the form. Let’s send a user to the detail page after success; that way they can see their completed post.  We can follow Django’s suggestion and add a get_absolute_url97 to our model. This is a best practice that you should always do. It sets a canonical URL for an object so even if the structure of your URLs changes in the future, the reference to the specific object is the same. In short, you should add a get_absolute_url   and __str__   method to each model you write.  Open the models.py file. Add an import on the second line for reverse98 and a new get_- absolute_url method.  97https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref models instances django.db.models.Model.get_absolute_url 98https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref urlresolvers reverse   110  Chapter 6: Forms  Code   blog models.py from django.db import models from django.urls import reverse  new  class Post models.Model :  title = models.CharField max_length=200  author = models.ForeignKey   'auth.User', on_delete=models.CASCADE,    body = models.TextField    def __str__ self :  return self.title  def get_absolute_url self :  new  return reverse 'post_detail', args=[str self.id ]   Reverse99 is a very handy utility function Django provides us to reference an object by its URL template name, in this case post_detail. If you recall, our URL pattern is the following:  Code   blog urls.py path 'post   ', BlogDetailView.as_view  , name='post_detail' ,  That means in order for this route to work we must also pass in an argument with the pk  primary key  of the object. Confusingly, pk and id are interchangeable in Django though the Django docs recommend using self.id with get_absolute_url. So we’re telling Django that the ultimate location of a Post entry is its post_detail view which is posts    so the route for the first entry we’ve made will be at posts 1.  Try to create a new blog post again at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 post new .  99https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref urlresolvers reverse   Chapter 6: Forms  111  Blog new page with fourth post  Upon clicking the “Save” button you are now redirected to the detailed view page where the post appears.  Blog individual page  Go over to the homepage at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 100 and you’ll also notice that our earlier blog post is also there. It was successfully sent to the database, but Django didn’t know how to redirect us after that.  100http:  127.0.0.1:8000    Chapter 6: Forms  112  Blog homepage with four posts  While we could go into the Django admin to delete unwanted posts, it’s better if we add forms so a user can update and delete existing posts directly from the site.  Update Form  The process for creating an update form so users can edit blog posts should feel familiar. We’ll again use a built-in Django class-based generic view, UpdateView101, and create the requisite template, url, and view.  To start, let’s add a new link to post_detail.html so that the option to edit a blog post appears on an individual blog page.  101https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref class-based-views generic-editing django.views.generic.edit.  UpdateView   Chapter 6: Forms  113  Code   {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block content %}      {{ post.title }}   {{ post.body }}       + Edit Blog Post   {% endblock content %}  We’ve added a link using  ...  and the Django template engine’s {% url ... %} tag. Within it, we’ve specified the target name of our url, which will be called post_edit and also passed the parameter needed, which is the primary key of the post post.pk.  Next we create the template for our edit page called post_edit.html.  Command Line  blog  $ touch templates post_edit.html  And add the following code:  Code   {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block content %}   Edit post   {% csrf_token %}  {{ form.as_p }}       {% endblock content %}  We again use HTML    tags, Django’s csrf_token for security, form.as_p to display our form fields with paragraph tags, and finally give it the value “Update” on the submit button.  Now to our view. We need to import UpdateView on the second-from-the-top line and then subclass it in our new view BlogUpdateView.   Chapter 6: Forms  Code   blog views.py from django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView, UpdateView  new from .models import Post  114  class BlogListView ListView :  model = Post template_name = 'home.html'  class BlogDetailView DetailView :  model = Post template_name = 'post_detail.html'  class BlogCreateView CreateView :  model = Post template_name = 'post_new.html' fields = ['title', 'author', 'body']  class BlogUpdateView UpdateView :  new  model = Post template_name = 'post_edit.html' fields = ['title', 'body']  Notice that in BlogUpdateView we are explicitly listing the fields we want to use ['title', 'body'] rather than using '__all__'. This is because we assume that the author of the post is not changing; we only want the title and text to be editable.  The final step is to update our urls.py file as follows. Add the BlogUpdateView up top and then the new route at the top of the existing URLpatterns.   115  Chapter 6: Forms  Code   blog urls.py from django.urls import path from .views import    BlogListView, BlogDetailView, BlogCreateView, BlogUpdateView,  new  urlpatterns = [  path 'post   edit ',     ]  BlogUpdateView.as_view  , name='post_edit' ,  new  path 'post new ', BlogCreateView.as_view  , name='post_new' , path 'post   ', BlogDetailView.as_view  , name='post_detail' , path '', BlogListView.as_view  , name='home' ,  At the top we add our view BlogUpdateView to the list of imported views, then created a new url pattern for  post pk edit and given it the name post_edit.  Now if you click on a blog entry you’ll see our new Edit button.  Blog page with edit button  If you click on “+ Edit Blog Post” you’ll be redirected to  post 1 edit  if it is your first blog post, hence the 1 in the URL. Note that the form is pre-filled with our database’s existing data for the post. Let’s make a change…   Chapter 6: Forms  116  Blog edit page  And after clicking the “Update” button we are redirected to the detail view of the post where you can see the change. This is because of our get_absolute_url setting. Navigate to the homepage and you can see the change next to all the other entries.   Chapter 6: Forms  117  Blog homepage with edited post  Delete View  The process for creating a form to delete blog posts is very similar to that for updating a post. We’ll use yet another generic class-based view, DeleteView102, create the necessary view, url, and template.  Let’s start by adding a link to delete blog posts on our individual blog page, post_detail.html.  102https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref class-based-views generic-editing deleteview   Chapter 6: Forms  118  Code   {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block content %}      {{ post.title }}   {{ post.body }}        + Edit Blog Post     + Delete Blog Post    {% endblock content %}  Then create a new file for our delete page template. First, quit the local server Control+c and then type the following command:  Command Line  blog  $ touch templates post_delete.html  And fill it with this code:  Code   {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block content %}   Delete post   {% csrf_token %}   Are you sure you want to delete "{{ post.title }}"?        {% endblock content %}  Note we are using post.title here to display the title of our blog post. We could also just use object.title as it too is provided by DetailView.  Now update the blog views.py file, by importing DeleteView and reverse_lazy at the top, then create a new view that subclasses DeleteView.   Chapter 6: Forms  Code   blog views.py from django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView from django.views.generic.edit import    CreateView, UpdateView, DeleteView     new from django.urls import reverse_lazy  new  119  from .models import Post  class BlogListView ListView :  model = Post template_name = 'home.html'  class BlogDetailView DetailView :  model = Post template_name = 'post_detail.html'  class BlogCreateView CreateView :  model = Post template_name = 'post_new.html' fields = ['title', 'author', 'body']  class BlogUpdateView UpdateView :  model = Post template_name = 'post_edit.html' fields = ['title', 'body']  class BlogDeleteView DeleteView :  new  model = Post template_name = 'post_delete.html' success_url = reverse_lazy 'home'   We use reverse_lazy103 as opposed to just reverse104 so that it won’t execute the URL redirect until our view has finished deleting the blog post.  103https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref urlresolvers reverse-lazy 104https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref urlresolvers reverse   Chapter 6: Forms  120  Finally, create a URL by importing our view BlogDeleteView and adding a new pattern:  Code   blog urls.py from django.urls import path from .views import    BlogListView, BlogDetailView, BlogCreateView, BlogUpdateView, BlogDeleteView,  new  urlpatterns = [     ]  path 'post   delete ',  new  BlogDeleteView.as_view  , name='post_delete' ,  path 'post new ', BlogCreateView.as_view  , name='post_new' , path 'post   ', BlogDetailView.as_view  , name='post_detail' , path 'post   edit ',  BlogUpdateView.as_view  , name='post_edit' ,  path '', BlogListView.as_view  , name='home' ,  If you start the server again with the command python manage.py runserver and refresh any individual post page you’ll see our “Delete Blog Post” link.  Blog delete post   Chapter 6: Forms  121  Clicking on the link takes us to the delete page for the blog post, which displays the name of the blog post.  Blog delete post page  If you click on the “Confirm” button, it redirects you to the homepage where the blog post has been deleted!  So it works!  Homepage with post deleted   Chapter 6: Forms  Tests  122  Time for tests to make sure everything works now–and in the future–as expected. We’ve added a get_absolute_url method to our model and new views for create, update, and delete posts. That means we need four new tests:    def test_get_absolute_url   def test_post_create_view   def test_post_update_view   def test_post_delete_view  Update your existing tests.py file as follows.  Code  blog tests.py from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model from django.test import TestCase from django.urls import reverse  from .models import Post  class BlogTests TestCase :  def setUp self :  self.user = get_user_model  .objects.create_user   username='testuser', email='test@email.com', password='secret'        self.post = Post.objects.create   title='A good title', body='Nice body content', author=self.user,  def test_string_representation self :  post = Post title='A sample title'  self.assertEqual str post , post.title    Chapter 6: Forms  123  def test_get_absolute_url self :  new  self.assertEqual self.post.get_absolute_url  , ' post 1 '   def test_post_content self :  self.assertEqual f'{self.post.title}', 'A good title'  self.assertEqual f'{self.post.author}', 'testuser'  self.assertEqual f'{self.post.body}', 'Nice body content'   def test_post_list_view self :  response = self.client.get reverse 'home'   self.assertEqual response.status_code, 200  self.assertContains response, 'Nice body content'  self.assertTemplateUsed response, 'home.html'   def test_post_detail_view self :  response = self.client.get ' post 1 '  no_response = self.client.get ' post 100000 '  self.assertEqual response.status_code, 200  self.assertEqual no_response.status_code, 404  self.assertContains response, 'A good title'  self.assertTemplateUsed response, 'post_detail.html'   def test_post_create_view self :  new  response = self.client.post reverse 'post_new' , {  'title': 'New title', 'body': 'New text', 'author': self.user.id,  }  self.assertEqual response.status_code, 302  self.assertEqual Post.objects.last  .title, 'New title'  self.assertEqual Post.objects.last  .body, 'New text'   def test_post_update_view self :  new  response = self.client.post reverse 'post_edit', args='1' , {  'title': 'Updated title', 'body': 'Updated text',  }  self.assertEqual response.status_code, 302   def test_post_delete_view self :  new  response = self.client.post   reverse 'post_delete', args='1'    self.assertEqual response.status_code, 302    Chapter 6: Forms  124  We expect the URL of our test to be at post 1  since there’s only one post and the 1 is its primary key Django adds automatically for us. To test create view we make a new response and then ensure that the response goes through  status code 200  and contains our new title and body text. For update view we access the first post–which has a pk of 1 which is passed in as the only argument–and we confirm that it results in a 302 redirect. Finally, we test our delete view by confirming that if we delete a post, the status code is 302, a redirect since the item no longer exists.  There’s always more tests that can be added but this at least has coverage on all our new functionality. Stop the local web server with Control+c and run these tests now. They should all pass.  Command Line   blog  $ python manage.py test Creating test database for alias 'default'... System check identified no issues  0 silenced . ........ ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ran 8 tests in 1.725s  OK Destroying test database for alias 'default'...  Conclusion  With a small amount of code we’ve built a Blog application that allows for creating, reading, up- dating, and deleting blog posts. This core functionality is known by the acronym CRUD: Create- Read-Update-Delete105. While there are multiple ways to achieve this same functionality–we could have used function-based views or written our own class-based views–we’ve demon- strated how little code it takes in Django to make this happen.  Note, however, a potential security concern: currently any user can update or delete blog entries, not just the creator! This is not ideal and indeed Django comes with built-in features to restrict access based on permissions, which we’ll cover in-depth in Chapter 14.  105https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Create,_read,_update_and_delete   Chapter 6: Forms  125  But for now our Blog application is working and in the next chapter we’ll add user accounts so users can sign up, log in, and log out of the web app.   Chapter 7: User Accounts  So far we’ve built a working blog application with forms but we’re missing a major piece of most web applications: user authentication.  Implementing proper user authentication is famously hard; there are many security gotchas along the way so you really don’t want to implement this yourself. Fortunately, Django comes with a powerful, built-in user authentication system106 that we can use and customize as needed.  Whenever you create a new project, by default Django installs the auth app, which provides us with a User object107 containing:    username    password    email    first_name    last_name  Log In  We will use this User object to implement log in, log out, and sign up in our blog application.  Django provides us with a default view for a log in page via LoginView108. All we need to add are a URLpattern for the auth system, a log in template, and a small update to our config settings.py file.  First, update the config urls.py file. We’ll place our log in and log out pages at the accounts  URL. This is a one-line addition on the next-to-last line.  106https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth  107https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref contrib auth django.contrib.auth.models.User 108https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth default django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView   Chapter 7: User Accounts  127  Code  config urls.py from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import path, include  urlpatterns = [  ]  path 'admin ', admin.site.urls , path 'accounts ', include 'django.contrib.auth.urls'  ,  new path '', include 'blog.urls'  ,  As the LoginView109 documentation notes, by default Django will look within a templates directory called registration for a file called login.html for a log in form. So we need to create a new directory called registration and the requisite file within it. From the command line type Control+c to quit our local server. Then enter the following:  Command Line  blog  $ mkdir templates registration  blog  $ touch templates registration login.html  Now type the following template code for our newly-created file.  Code   {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block content %}  Log In     {% csrf_token %} {{ form.as_p }}  Log In     {% endblock content %}  We’re using HTML    tags and specifying the POST method since we’re sending data to the server  we’d use GET if we were requesting data, such as in a search engine form . We add  109https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth default django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView   Chapter 7: User Accounts  128  {% csrf_token %} for security concerns, namely to prevent a XSS Attack. The form’s contents are outputted between paragraph tags thanks to {{ form.as_p }} and then we add a “submit” button.  The final step is we need to specify where to redirect the user upon a successful log in. We can set this with the LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL setting. At the bottom of the config settings.py file add the following:  Code   config settings.py LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'  Now the user will be redirected to the 'home' template which is our homepage. And we’re actually done at this point! If you now start up the Django server again with python manage.py runserver and navigate to our log in page at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 accounts login  you’ll see the following:  Log in page  Upon entering the log in info for our superuser account, we are redirected to the homepage. Notice that we didn’t add any view logic or create a database model because the Django auth system provided both for us automatically. Thanks Django!   Chapter 7: User Accounts  Updated Homepage  129  Let’s update our base.html template so we display a message to users whether they are logged in or not. We can use the is_authenticated110 attribute for this.  For now, we can simply place this code in a prominent position. Later on we can style it more appropriately. Update the base.html file with new code starting beneath the closing   tag.   Django blog  <link href="https:  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:400" rel="stylesh\     Code    {% load static %}       eet">                      Django blog     + New Blog Post       {% if user.is_authenticated %}   Hi {{ user.username }}!   {% else %}   You are not logged in.   Log In   {% endif %}  {% block content %} {% endblock content %}         110https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref contrib auth django.contrib.auth.models.User.is_authenticated   Chapter 7: User Accounts  130  If the user is logged in we say hello to them by name, if not we provide a link to our newly created log in page.  It worked! My superuser name is wsv so that’s what I see on the page.  Homepage logged in  Log Out Link  We added template page logic for logged out users but…how do we log out now? We could go into the Admin panel and do it manually, but there’s a better way. Let’s add a log out link instead that redirects to the homepage. Thanks to the Django auth system, this is dead-simple to achieve.  In our base.html file add a one-line {% url 'logout' %} link for logging out just below our user greeting.   Chapter 7: User Accounts  131  Command Line    ... {% if user.is_authenticated %}   Hi {{ user.username }}!    Log out    {% else %} ...  That’s all we need to do as the necessary view is provided to us by the Django auth app. We do need to specify where to redirect a user upon log out though.  Update config settings.py to provide a redirect link which is called, appropriately, LOGOUT_- REDIRECT_URL. We can add it right next to our log in redirect so the bottom of the file should look as follows:  Code   config settings.py LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'home' LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'  new  If you refresh the homepage you’ll see it now has a “log out” link for logged in users.   Chapter 7: User Accounts  132  And clicking it takes you back to the homepage with a login link.  Homepage log out link  Homepage logged out   Chapter 7: User Accounts  133  Go ahead and try logging in and out several times with your user account.  Sign Up  We need to write our own view for a sign up page to register new users, but Django provides us with a form class, UserCreationForm111, to make things easier. By default it comes with three fields: username, password1, and password2.  There are many ways to organize your code and URL structure for a robust user authentication system. Stop the local server with Control+c and create a dedicated new app, accounts, for our sign up page.  Command Line   blog  $ python manage.py startapp accounts  Add the new app to the INSTALLED_APPS setting in our config settings.py file.  Code   config settings.py INSTALLED_APPS = [  'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'blog', 'accounts',  new  ]  Next add a new URL path in config urls.py pointing to this new app directly below where we include the built-in auth app.  111https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth default django.contrib.auth.forms.UserCreationForm   Chapter 7: User Accounts  134  Code   config urls.py from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import path, include  urlpatterns = [  path 'admin ', admin.site.urls , path 'accounts ', include 'django.contrib.auth.urls'  , path 'accounts ', include 'accounts.urls'  ,  new path '', include 'blog.urls'  ,  The order of our urls matters here because Django reads this file top-to-bottom. Therefore when we request the  accounts signup url, Django will first look in auth, not find it, and then proceed to the accounts app.  Let’s go ahead and create our accounts urls.py file.  Command Line   blog  $ touch accounts urls.py  And add the following code:  Code   accounts urls.py from django.urls import path from .views import SignUpView  urlpatterns = [  path 'signup ', SignUpView.as_view  , name='signup' ,  ]  ]  We’re using a not-yet-created view called SignupView which we already know is class-based since it is capitalized and has the as_view   suffix. Its path is just signup  so the overall URL path will be accounts signup .  Now for the view which uses the built-in UserCreationForm and generic CreateView.   135  Chapter 7: User Accounts  Code   accounts views.py from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm from django.urls import reverse_lazy from django.views import generic  class SignUpView generic.CreateView :  form_class = UserCreationForm success_url = reverse_lazy 'login'  template_name = 'registration signup.html'  We’re subclassing the generic class-based view CreateView in our SignUpView class. We specify the use of the built-in UserCreationForm and the not-yet-created template at signup.html. And we use reverse_lazy to redirect the user to the log in page upon successful registration.  Why use reverse_lazy here instead of reverse? The reason is that for all generic class-based views the URLs are not loaded when the file is imported, so we have to use the lazy form of reverse to load them later when they’re available.  Now let’s add signup.html to the templates registration  directory.  Command Line   blog  $ touch templates registration signup.html  Add then populate it with the code below.   Chapter 7: User Accounts  136  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block content %}  Sign Up     {% csrf_token %} {{ form.as_p }}  Sign Up      {% endblock content %}  This format is very similar to what we’ve done before. We extend our base template at the top, place our logic between    tags, use the csrf_token for security, display the form’s content in paragraph tags with form.as_p, and include a submit button.  We’re now done! To test it out, start up the local server with python manage.py runserver and navigate to http:  127.0.0.1:8000 accounts signup .   Chapter 7: User Accounts  137  Django sign up page  Notice there is a lot of extra text that Django includes by default. We can customize this using something like the built-in messages framework112 but for now try out the form.  I’ve created a new user called “william” and upon submission was redirected to the log in page. Then after logging in successfully with my new user and password, I was redirected to the homepage with our personalized “Hi username” greeting.  112https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref contrib messages    Chapter 7: User Accounts  138  Homepage for user william  Our ultimate flow is therefore: Signup -> Login -> Homepage. And of course we can tweak this however we want. The SignupView redirects to login because we set success_url = reverse_- lazy 'login' . The Login page redirects to the homepage because in our config settings.py file we set LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'.  It can seem overwhelming at first to keep track of all the various parts of a Django project. That’s normal. But I promise with time they’ll start to make more sense.  GitHub  It’s been a while since we made a git commit. Let’s do that and then push a copy of our code onto GitHub. First check all the new work that we’ve done with git status.   139  Chapter 7: User Accounts  Command Line  blog  $ git status  Then add the new content and enter a commit message.  Command Line  blog  $ git add -A  blog  $ git commit -m "forms and user accounts"  Create a new repo113 on GitHub which you can call anything you like. I’ll choose the name blog-app. Therefore, after creating the new repo on the GitHub site ,I can type the following two commands. Make sure to replace my username wsvincent with your own from GitHub.  Command Line  blog  $ git remote add origin https:  github.com wsvincent blog-app.git  blog  $ git push -u origin master  All done!  Static Files  Previously, we configured our static files by creating a dedicated static folder, pointing STATICFILES_DIRS to it in our config settings.py file, and adding {% load static %} to our base.html template. But since Django won’t serve static files in production, we need a few extra steps now.  The first change is to use Django’s collectstatic command which compiles all static files throughout the project into a singe directory suitable for deployment. Second, we must set the STATIC_ROOT114 configuration, which is the absolute location of these collected files, to a folder called staticfiles. And third, we need to set STATICFILES_STORAGE115, which is the file storage engine used by collectstatic.  Here is what the updated config settings.py file should look like:  113https:  github.com new 114https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref settings static-root 115https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref settings staticfiles-storage   Chapter 7: User Accounts  Code   config settings.py STATIC_URL = ' static ' STATICFILES_DIRS = [str BASE_DIR.joinpath 'static'  ] STATIC_ROOT = STATIC_ROOT = str BASE_DIR.joinpath 'staticfiles'    new STATICFILES_STORAGE =  'django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.StaticFilesStorage'  new  140  Now run the command python manage.py collectstatic:  Command Line   blog  $ python manage.py collectstatic  If you look at your project folder now you’ll see there’s a new staticfiles folder that contains admin and css folders. The admin is the built-in admin’s static files, while the css is the one we created. Before each new deployment, the collectstatic command must be run to compile them into this staticfiles folder used in production. Since this is an easy step to forget it is often automated in larger projects though doing so is beyond the scope of our current project.  While there are multiple ways to serve these compiled static files in production, the most common approach–and the one we will use here–is to introduce the WhiteNoise116 package.  To start, install the latest version using Pipenv:  Command Line   blog  $ pipenv install whitenoise==5.1.0  Then in config settings.py there are three updates to make:    add whitenoise to the INSTALLED_APPS above the built-in staticfiles app   under MIDDLEWARE add a new line for WhiteNoiseMiddleware   change STATICFILES_STORAGE to use WhiteNoise  The updated file should look as follows:  116http:  whitenoise.evans.io en stable    141  Chapter 7: User Accounts  Code  config settings.py INSTALLED_APPS = [  'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'whitenoise.runserver_nostatic',  new 'django.contrib.staticfiles',  'blog', 'accounts',  MIDDLEWARE = [  ]  ]  'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware', 'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware', 'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',  new 'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware', ...  STATIC_URL = ' static ' STATICFILES_DIRS = [str BASE_DIR.joinpath 'static'  ] STATIC_ROOT = str BASE_DIR.joinpath 'staticfiles'   STATICFILES_STORAGE =  'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'  new  Since our STATICFILES_STORAGE method has changed, run collectstatic one more time to use whitenoise instead:  Command Line  blog  $ python manage.py collectstatic  There will be a short warning, This will overwrite existing files! Are you sure you want to do this? Type “yes” and hit RETURN. The collected static files are now regenerated in the same staticfiles folder using WhiteNoise.  Static files are quite confusing to newcomers, so as a brief recap here are the steps we’ve executed so far in our Blog site. First, for local development back in Chapter 5, we created   Chapter 7: User Accounts  142  a top-level static folder and updated STATICFILES_DIRS to point to it. In this chapter, we added configurations for STATIC_ROOT and STATICFILES_STORAGE before running collectstatic for the first time, which compiled all our static files across the entire project into a single staticfiles folder. Finally, we installed whitenoise, updated INSTALLED_APPS, MIDDLEWARE, and STATICFILES_STORAGE, and re-ran collectstatic.  Most developers, myself included, have trouble remembering all these steps properly and rely on notes as a friendly reminder!  Now we come to Heroku for our third time deploying a website. Our deployment checklist is as follows:  Heroku Config    install Gunicorn   add a Procfile   update ALLOWED_HOSTS  Create a new Procfile file.  Command Line   blog  $ touch Procfile  Ready? Let’s begin. Install Gunicorn as our production web server:  Command Line   mb  $ pipenv install gunicorn==19.9.0  Within your text editor, add the following line which tells Heroku to use Gunicorn rather than the local server for production.   Chapter 7: User Accounts  143  web: gunicorn config.wsgi --log-file -  Then update the existing ALLOWED_HOSTS in config settings.py.  Procfile  Code   config settings.py ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['.herokuapp.com', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1']  All set. We can commit our changes and push them up to GitHub.  Command Line   blog  $ git status  blog  $ git add -A  blog  $ git commit -m "Heroku config"  blog  $ git push -u origin master  To deploy on Heroku first confirm that you’re logged in to your existing Heroku account.  Heroku Deployment  Command Line   blog  $ heroku login  Then run the create command which tells Heroku to make a new container for our app to live in. If you just run heroku create then Heroku will assign you a random name, however you can specify a custom name but it must be unique on Heroku. In other words, since I’m picking the name dfb-blog you can’t. You need some other combination of letters and numbers.   Chapter 7: User Accounts  144  Command Line   blog  $ heroku create dfb-blog  Heroku runs Django’s collectstatic command automatically, which is why in the previous apps, where we had not configured static files, we told Heroku to disable this step with heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1. But since we have configured static files, we’ll happily let this happen now as part of the deployment process.  The final step is to push our code to Heroku and add a web process so the dyno is running.  Command Line   blog  $ git push heroku master  blog  $ heroku ps:scale web=1  The URL of your new app will be in the command line output or you can run heroku open to find it. Mine is located at https:  dfb-blog.herokuapp.com 117.  117https:  dfb-blog.herokuapp.com   Heroku site   Chapter 7: User Accounts  Conclusion  145  With a minimal amount of code, we have added log in, log out, and sign up to our Blog website. Under-the-hood Django has taken care of the many security gotchas that can crop up if you try to create your own user authentication flow from scratch. We properly configured static files for production and deployed our website, yet again, to Heroku. Good job!  In the next chapter, we’ll embark on the final major project of the book, a Newspaper site which uses a custom user model, advanced user registration flow, enhanced styling via Bootstrap, and email configuration. It also includes proper permissions and authorizations, environment variables, and more security improvements to our deployment process.   Chapter 8: Custom User Model  Django’s built-in User model118 allows us to start working with users right away, as we just did with our Blog app in the previous chapters. However, the official Django documentation119 highly recommends using a custom user model for new projects. The reason is that if you want to make any changes to the User model down the road–-for example adding an age field-–using a custom user model from the beginning makes this quite easy. But if you do not create a custom user model, updating the default User model in an existing Django project is very, very challenging.  So always use a custom user model for all new Django projects. But the approach demonstrated in the official documentation example120 is actually not what many Django experts recommend. It uses the quite complex AbstractBaseUser when if we just use AbstractUser instead things are far simpler and still customizable.  Thus we will use AbstractUser in this chapter where we start a new Newspaper app properly with environment variables and a custom user model. The choice of a newspaper app pays homage to Django’s roots as a web framework built for editors and journalists at the Lawrence Journal- World.  Initial Set Up  The first step is to create a new Django project from the command line. We need to do several things:    create and navigate into a new directory for our code   create a new virtual environment news    install Django  118https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref contrib auth django.contrib.auth.models.User 119https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth customizing using-a-custom-user-model-when-  starting-a-project  120https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth customizing a-full-example   Chapter 8: Custom User Model  147    make a new Django project config   make a new app accounts  Here are the commands to run:  Command Line  $ cd ~ Desktop $ mkdir news $ cd news $ pipenv install django~=3.1.0 $ pipenv shell  news  $ django-admin startproject config .  news  $ python manage.py startapp accounts  news  $ python manage.py runserver  Note that we did not run migrate to configure our database. It’s important to wait until after we’ve created our new custom user model before doing so given how tightly connected the user model is to the rest of Django.  If you navigate to http:  127.0.0.1:8000 you’ll see the familiar Django welcome screen.   Chapter 8: Custom User Model  148  Welcome page  Custom User Model  Creating our custom user model requires four steps:   Chapter 8: Custom User Model  149    update config settings.py   create a new CustomUser model   create new forms for UserCreationForm and UserChangeForm   update accounts admin.py  In config settings.py we’ll add the accounts app to our INSTALLED_APPS. Then at the bottom of the file use the AUTH_USER_MODEL config to tell Django to use our new custom user model in place of the built-in User model. We’ll call our custom user model CustomUser so, since it exists within our accounts app we refer to it as accounts.CustomUser.  Code   config settings.py INSTALLED_APPS = [  'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'accounts',  new  ] ... AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.CustomUser'  new  Now update accounts models.py with a new User model which we’ll call CustomUser that extends the existing AbstractUser. We also include our first custom field, age, here.   Chapter 8: Custom User Model  Code   accounts models.py from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser from django.db import models  class CustomUser AbstractUser :  age = models.PositiveIntegerField null=True, blank=True   150  If you read the official documentation on custom user models121 it recommends using AbstractBaseUser not AbstractUser. This needlessly complicates things in my opinion, especially for beginners.  AbstractBaseUser vs AbstractUser  AbstractBaseUser requires a very fine level of control and customization. We essentially rewrite Django. This can be helpful, but if we just want a custom user model that can be updated with additional fields, the better choice is AbstractUser which subclasses AbstractBaseUser. In other words, we write much less code and have less opportunity to mess things up. It’s the better choice unless you really know what you’re doing with Django!  Note that we use both null122 and blank123 with our age field. These two terms are easy to confuse but quite distinct:    null is database-related. When a field has null=True it can store a database entry as NULL,  meaning no value.    blank is validation-related, if blank=True then a form will allow an empty value, whereas  if blank=False then a value is required.  In practice, null and blank are commonly used together in this fashion so that a form allows an empty value and the database stores that value as NULL.  121https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth customizing specifying-a-custom-user-model 122https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref models fields null 123https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref models fields blank   Chapter 8: Custom User Model  151  A common gotcha to be aware of is that the field type dictates how to use these values. Whenever you have a string-based field like CharField or TextField, setting both null and blank as we’ve done will result in two possible values for “no data” in the database. Which is a bad idea. The Django convention is instead to use the empty string '', not NULL.  Forms  If we step back for a moment, what are the two ways in which we would interact with our new CustomUser model? One case is when a user signs up for a new account on our website. The other is within the admin app which allows us, as superusers, to modify existing users. So we’ll need to update the two built-in forms for this functionality: UserCreationForm124 and UserChangeForm125.  Stop the local server with Control+c and create a new file in the accounts app called forms.py.  Command Line   news  $ touch accounts forms.py  We’ll update it with the following code to extend the existing UserCreationForm and UserChangeForm forms.  Code   accounts forms.py from django import forms from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm, UserChangeForm from .models import CustomUser  class CustomUserCreationForm UserCreationForm :  class Meta UserCreationForm :  model = CustomUser fields = UserCreationForm.Meta.fields +  'age',   124https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth default django.contrib.auth.forms.UserCreationForm 125https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth default django.contrib.auth.forms.UserChangeForm   Chapter 8: Custom User Model  152  class CustomUserChangeForm UserChangeForm :  class Meta:  model = CustomUser fields = UserChangeForm.Meta.fields  For both new forms we are using the Meta class126 to override the default fields by setting the model to our CustomUser and using the default fields via Meta.fields which includes all default fields. To add our custom age field we simply tack it on at the end and it will display automatically on our future sign up page. Pretty slick, no?  The concept of fields on a form can be confusing at first so let’s take a moment to explore it further. Our CustomUser model contains all the fields of the default User model and our additional age field which we set.  But what are these default fields? It turns out there are many127 including username, first_name, last_name, email, password, groups, and more. Yet when a user signs up for a new account on Django the default form only asks for a username, email, and password. This tells us that the default setting for fields on UserCreationForm is just username, email, and password even though there are many more fields available.  This might not click for you since understanding forms and models properly takes some time. In the next chapter we will create our own sign up, log in, and log out pages which will tie together our CustomUser model and forms more clearly. So hang tight!  The only other step we need is to update our admin.py file since Admin is tightly coupled to the default User model. We will extend the existing UserAdmin128 class to use our new CustomUser model.  126https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics forms modelforms overriding-the-default-fields 127https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref contrib auth django.contrib.auth.models.User 128https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth customizing extending-the-existing-user-model   Chapter 8: Custom User Model  Code   accounts admin.py from django.contrib import admin from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin from .forms import CustomUserCreationForm, CustomUserChangeForm from .models import CustomUser  153  class CustomUserAdmin UserAdmin :  add_form = CustomUserCreationForm form = CustomUserChangeForm model = CustomUser  admin.site.register CustomUser, CustomUserAdmin   Ok we’re done! Type Control+c to stop the local server and go ahead and run makemigrations and migrate for the first time to create a new database that uses the custom user model.  Command Line   news  $ python manage.py makemigrations accounts Migrations for 'accounts':  accounts migrations 0001_initial.py  - Create model CustomUser   news  $ python manage.py migrate Operations to perform:  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions, users  Running migrations:  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial...

OK  Superuser  Let’s create a superuser account to confirm that everything is working as expected.  On the command line type the following command and go through the prompts.  Command Line   news  $ python manage.py createsuperuser  The fact that this works is the first proof our custom user model works as expected. Let’s view things in the admin too to be extra sure.  Start up the web server.  Command Line   news  $ python manage.py runserver  Then navigate to the admin at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 admin and log in. If you click on the link for “Users,” you should see your superuser account as well as the default fields of Username, Email Address, First Name, Last Name, and Staff Status.   Chapter 8: Custom User Model  155  Admin one user  To control the fields listed here we use list_display129. However, to actually edit and add new custom fields, like age, we must also add fieldsets130.  Code   accounts admin.py from django.contrib import admin from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin  from .forms import CustomUserCreationForm, CustomUserChangeForm from .models import CustomUser  class CustomUserAdmin UserAdmin :  add_form = CustomUserCreationForm form = CustomUserChangeForm model = CustomUser list_display = ['email', 'username', 'age', 'is_staff', ]  new fieldsets = UserAdmin.fieldsets +    new   None, {'fields':  'age', } ,     admin  129https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref contrib admin django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display 130https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth customizing custom-users-and-django-contrib-   Chapter 8: Custom User Model  156  add_fieldsets = UserAdmin.add_fieldsets +    new   None, {'fields':  'age', } ,     admin.site.register CustomUser, CustomUserAdmin   Refresh the page and you should see the update.  Admin custom list display  Conclusion  With our custom user model complete, we can now focus on building out the rest of our Newspaper website. In the next chapter we will configure and customize sign up, log in, and log out pages.   Chapter 9: User Authentication  Now that we have a working custom user model we can add the functionality every website needs: the ability to sign up, log in, and log out users. Django provides everything we need for log in and log out but we will need to create our own form to sign up new users. We’ll also build a basic homepage with links to all three features so we don’t have to type in the URLs by hand every time.  Templates  By default, the Django template loader looks for templates in a nested structure within each app. The structure accounts templates accounts home.html would be needed for a home.html template within the accounts app. But a single templates directory within config approach is cleaner and scales better so that’s what we’ll use.  Let’s create a new templates directory and within it a registration directory as that’s where Django will look for the log in template.  Command Line   news  $ mkdir templates  news  $ mkdir templates registration  Now we need to tell Django about this new directory by updating the configuration for 'DIRS' in config settings.py. This is a one-line change.   Chapter 9: User Authentication  158   config settings.py TEMPLATES = [  Code  {  }  ]  ... 'DIRS': [str BASE_DIR.joinpath 'templates'  ],  new ...  If you think about what happens when you log in or log out of a site, you are immediately redirected to a subsequent page. We need to tell Django where to send users in each case. The LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL and LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL settings do that. We’ll configure both to redirect to our homepage which will have the named URL of 'home'.  Remember that when we create our URL routes we have the option to add a name to each one. So when we make the homepage URL we’ll make sure to call it 'home'.  Add these two lines at the bottom of the config settings.py file.  Code   config settings.py LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'  new LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = 'home'  new  Now we can create four new templates:  Command Line   news  $ touch templates base.html  news  $ touch templates home.html  news  $ touch templates registration login.html  news  $ touch templates registration signup.html  Here’s the HTML code for each file to use. The base.html will be inherited by every other template in our project. By using a block like {% block content %} we can later override the content just in this place in other templates.   Chapter 9: User Authentication  159     {% block title %}Newspaper App{% endblock title %}   Code           {% block content %} {% endblock content %}                  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block title %}Home{% endblock title %}  {% block content %} {% if user.is_authenticated %}  Hi {{ user.username }}!   Log Out    {% else %}   You are not logged in   Log In    Sign Up   {% endif %} {% endblock content %}   Chapter 9: User Authentication  160  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block title %}Log In{% endblock title %}  {% block content %}  Log In     {% csrf_token %} {{ form.as_p }}  Log In     {% endblock content %}  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block title %}Sign Up{% endblock title %}  {% block content %}  Sign Up     {% csrf_token %} {{ form.as_p }}  Sign Up     {% endblock content %}  Our templates are now all set. Still to go are the related URLs and views.  URLs  Let’s start with the URL routes. In our config urls.py file, we want to have our home.html template appear as the homepage, but we don’t want to build a dedicated pages app just yet. We can use the shortcut of importing TemplateView and setting the template_name right in our url pattern.   Chapter 9: User Authentication  161  Next, we want to “include” both the accounts app and the built-in auth app. The reason is that the built-in auth app already provides views and urls for log in and log out. But for sign up we will need to create our own view and url. To ensure that our URL routes are consistent we place them both at accounts  so the eventual URLS will be  accounts login,  accounts logout, and  accounts signup.  Code   config urls.py from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import path, include  new from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView  new  urlpatterns = [  path 'admin ', admin.site.urls , path 'accounts ', include 'accounts.urls'  ,  new path 'accounts ', include 'django.contrib.auth.urls'  ,  new path '', TemplateView.as_view template_name='home.html' ,  name='home' ,  new  ]  Now create a urls.py file in the accounts app.  Command Line   news  $ touch accounts urls.py  Update accounts urls.py with the following code:   Chapter 9: User Authentication  162  Code  ]  Code   accounts urls.py from django.urls import path from .views import SignUpView  urlpatterns = [  path 'signup ', SignUpView.as_view  , name='signup' ,  The last step is our views.py file which will contain the logic for our sign up form. We’re using Django’s generic CreateView here and telling it to use our CustomUserCreationForm, to redirect to login once a user signs up successfully, and that our template is named signup.html.   accounts views.py from django.urls import reverse_lazy from django.views.generic import CreateView from .forms import CustomUserCreationForm  class SignUpView CreateView :  form_class = CustomUserCreationForm success_url = reverse_lazy 'login'  template_name = 'registration signup.html'  Ok, phew! We’re done. Let’s test things out.  Start up the server with python manage.py runserver and go to the homepage.  Homepage logged in  We logged in to the admin in the previous chapter so you should see a personalized greeting here. Click on the “Log Out” link.   Chapter 9: User Authentication  163  Homepage logged out  Now we’re on the logged out homepage. Go ahead and click on login link and use your superuser credentials.  Log in  Upon successfully logging in you’ll be redirected back to the homepage and see the same personalized greeting. It works! Now use the “Log Out” link to return to the homepage and this time click on the “Sign Up” link. You’ll be redirected to our signup page. See that the age field is included!  Sign up page  Create a new user. Mine is called testuser and I’ve set the age to 25. After successfully submitting the form you’ll be redirected to the log in page. Log in with your new user and you’ll again be   Chapter 9: User Authentication  164  redirected to the homepage with a personalized greeting for the new user. But since we have the new age field, let’s add that to the home.html template. It is a field on the user model, so to display it we only need to use {{ user.age }}.  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block title %}Home{% endblock title %}  {% block content %} {% if user.is_authenticated %}  Hi {{ user.username }}! You are {{ user.age }} years old.   Log Out    {% else %}   You are not logged in   Log In    Sign Up   {% endif %} {% endblock content %}  Save the file and refresh the homepage.  Homepage for testuser  Everything works as expected.  Admin  Let’s also log in to the admin to view our two user accounts. Navigate to http:  127.0.0.1:8000 admin and …   Chapter 9: User Authentication  165  Admin log in wrong  What’s this! Why can’t we log in? Well we’re logged in with our new testuser account not our superuser account. Only a superuser account has the permissions to log in to the admin! So use your superuser account to log in instead.  After you’ve done that you should see the normal admin homepage. Click on Users and you can see our two users: the testuser account we just created and your previous superuser name  mine is wsv .   Chapter 9: User Authentication  166  Users in the Admin  Everything is working but you may notice that there is no “Email address” for our testuser. Why is that? Well, our sign up page has no email field because it was not included in accounts forms.py. This is an important point: just because the user model has a field, it will not be included in our custom sign up form unless it is explicitly added. Let’s do so now.  Currently, in accounts forms.py under fields we’re using Meta.fields, which just displays the default settings of username age password. But we can also explicitly set which fields we want displayed so let’s update it to ask for a username email age password by setting it to  'username', 'email', 'age', . We don’t need to include the password fields because they are required! All the other fields can be configured however we choose.   Chapter 9: User Authentication  167  Code  accounts forms.py from django import forms from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm, UserChangeForm  from .models import CustomUser  class CustomUserCreationForm UserCreationForm :  class Meta UserCreationForm :  model = CustomUser fields =  'username', 'email', 'age',   new  class CustomUserChangeForm UserChangeForm :  class Meta:  model = CustomUser fields =  'username', 'email', 'age',   new  Now if you try http:  127.0.0.1:8000 accounts signup  again you can see the additional “Email address” field is there.  New sign up page  Sign up with a new user account. I’ve named mine testuser2 with an age of 18 and an email address of testuser2@email.com. Continue to log in and you’ll see a personalized greeting on the homepage.   Chapter 9: User Authentication  168  testuser2 homepage greeting  Then switch back to the admin page–log in using our superuser account to do so–and all three users are on display.  Three users in the Admin  Django’s user authentication flow requires a little bit of set up but you should be starting to see that it also provides us incredible flexibility to configure sign up and log in exactly how we want.  Conclusion  So far our Newspaper app has a custom user model and working sign up, log in, and log out pages. But you may have noticed our site doesn’t look very good. In the next chapter we’ll add Bootstrap131 for styling and create a dedicated pages app.  131https:  getbootstrap.com    Chapter 10: Bootstrap  Web development requires a lot of skills. Not only do you have to program the website to work correctly, users expect it to look good, too. When you’re creating everything from scratch, it can be overwhelming to also add all the necessary HTML CSS for a beautiful site.  While it’s possible to hand-code all the required CSS and JavaScript for a modern-looking website, in practice most developers user a framework like Bootstrap132 or TailwindCSS133. For our project, we’ll use Bootstrap which can be extended and customized as needed.  Pages App  In the previous chapter we displayed our homepage by including view logic in our urls.py file. While this approach works, it feels somewhat hackish to me and it certainly doesn’t scale as a website grows over time. It is also probably somewhat confusing to Django newcomers. Instead, we can and should create a dedicated pages app for all our static pages, such as the homepage, a future about page, and so on. This will keep our code nice and organized going forward.  On the command line ,use the startapp command to create our new pages app. If the server is still running you may need to type Control+c first to quit it.  Command Line   news  $ python manage.py startapp pages  Then immediately update our config settings.py file. I often forget to do this so it is a good practice to just think of creating a new app as a two-step process: run the startapp command then update INSTALLED_APPS.  132https:  getbootstrap.com  133https:  tailwindcss.com    170  Chapter 10: Bootstrap  Code   config settings.py INSTALLED_APPS = [  'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'accounts', 'pages',  new  ]  ]  Now we can update our urls.py file inside the config directory by adding the pages app, removing the import of TemplateView, and removing the previous URL path for the older homepage.  Code   config urls.py from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import path, include  urlpatterns = [  path 'admin ', admin.site.urls , path 'accounts ', include 'accounts.urls'  , path 'accounts ', include 'django.contrib.auth.urls'  , path '', include 'pages.urls'  ,  new  It’s time to add our homepage which means Django’s standard urls views templates dance. We’ll start with the pages urls.py file. First create it.  Command Line   news  $ touch pages urls.py  Then import our not-yet-created views, set the route paths, and make sure to name each url, too.   Chapter 10: Bootstrap  171  Code  pages urls.py from django.urls import path from .views import HomePageView  urlpatterns = [  ]  path '', HomePageView.as_view  , name='home' ,  Code  pages views.py from django.views.generic import TemplateView  class HomePageView TemplateView :  template_name = 'home.html'  The views.py code should look familiar at this point. We’re using Django’s TemplateView generic class-based view which means we only need to specify our template_name to use it.  We already have an existing home.html template. Let’s confirm it still works as expected with our new url and view. Start up the local server python manage.py runserver and navigate to the homepage at http:  127.0.0.1:8000  to confirm it remains unchanged.  Homepage logged in  It should show the name of your logged in superuser account which we used at the end of the last chapter. And, interestingly, since we have not added an age field to our superuser, Django defaults to displaying None.  Tests  We’ve added new code and functionality which means it’s time for tests. You can never have enough tests in your projects. Even though they take some upfront time to write, they always   Chapter 10: Bootstrap  172  save you time down the road and give confidence as a project grows in complexity.  There are two ideal times to add tests: either before you write any code  test-driven-develop- ment  or immediately after you’ve added new functionality and it’s clear in your mind.  Currently, our project has four pages:    home    sign up    log in    log out  We only need tests, however, for the first two. Log in and log out are part of Django and rely on internal views, URL routes, templates, and tests. We do not need to re-test core Django functionality. If we made substantial changes to either of them in the future, we would want to add tests for that, but as a general rule, you do not need to add tests for core Django functionality.  Since we have URLs, templates, and views for each of our two new pages we’ll add tests for each. Django’s SimpleTestCase134 will suffice for testing the homepage but the sign up page uses the database so we’ll need to use TestCase135 too.  Here’s what the code should look like in your pages tests.py file.  Code   pages tests.py from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model from django.test import SimpleTestCase, TestCase from django.urls import reverse  class HomePageTests SimpleTestCase :  def test_home_page_status_code self :  response = self.client.get ' '  self.assertEqual response.status_code, 200   def test_view_url_by_name self :  134https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics testing tools simpletestcase 135https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics testing tools testcase   Chapter 10: Bootstrap  173  response = self.client.get reverse 'home'   self.assertEqual response.status_code, 200   def test_view_uses_correct_template self :  response = self.client.get reverse 'home'   self.assertEqual response.status_code, 200  self.assertTemplateUsed response, 'home.html'   class SignupPageTests TestCase :  username = 'newuser' email = 'newuser@email.com'  def test_signup_page_status_code self :  response = self.client.get ' accounts signup '  self.assertEqual response.status_code, 200   def test_view_url_by_name self :  response = self.client.get reverse 'signup'   self.assertEqual response.status_code, 200   def test_view_uses_correct_template self :  response = self.client.get reverse 'signup'   self.assertEqual response.status_code, 200  self.assertTemplateUsed response, 'registration signup.html'   def test_signup_form self :  new_user = get_user_model  .objects.create_user   self.username, self.email   self.assertEqual get_user_model  .objects.all  .count  , 1  self.assertEqual get_user_model  .objects.all    self.assertEqual get_user_model  .objects.all    [0].username, self.username   [0].email, self.email   On the top line we use get_user_model  136 to reference our custom user model. Then for both pages we test three things:    the page exists and returns a HTTP 200 status code    the page uses the correct url name in the view  136https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth customizing django.contrib.auth.get_user_model   Chapter 10: Bootstrap  174    the proper template is being used  Our sign up page also has a form so we should test that, too. In the test test_signup_form we’re verifying that when a username and email address are POSTed  sent to the database , they match what is stored on the CustomUser model.  Note that there are two ways to specify a page: either hardcoded as in test_signup_page_- status_code where we set the response to  accounts signup  or via the URL name of signup which is done for test_view_url_by_name and test_view_uses_correct_template.  Quit the local server with Control+c and then run our tests to confirm everything passes.  Command Line   news  $ python manage.py test Creating test database for alias 'default'...

Bootstrap  If you’ve never used Bootstrap before you’re in for a real treat. Much like Django, it accomplishes so much in so little code.  There are two ways to add Bootstrap to a project: you can download all the files and serve them locally or rely on a Content Delivery Network  CDN . The second approach is simpler to implement provided you have a consistent internet connection so that’s what we’ll use here. You can see the four lines to add on the Bootstrap introduction137 page:    Bootstrap.css   jQuery.js  137https:  getbootstrap.com docs 4.5 getting-started introduction    175  We’ll also need to add a meta name="viewport" line to    for it all to work properly. In general, typing out all code yourself is the recommended approach but adding the Bootstrap CDN is an exception since it is lengthy and easy to miss-type.

Notably, we can use the if else139 tags in the Django templating engine to add some basic logic. We want to show a “log in” and “sign up” button to users who are logged out, but a “log out” and “change password” button to users logged in.  Again, it’s ok to copy paste here since the focus of this book is on learning Django not HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.  Code    ...

If you refresh the homepage at http:  127.0.0.1:8000  our new nav has magically appeared! We’ve also added "container" divs around our content, which is a Bootstrap way of providing automatic side padding to a site.  Homepage with Bootstrap nav logged in  Click on the username in the upper right hand corner–wsv in my case–to see the nice dropdown menu Bootstrap provides.   Chapter 10: Bootstrap  178  Homepage with Bootstrap nav logged in and dropdown  If you click on the “Log Out” the nav bar changes to button links for either “Log In” or “Sign Up.”  Homepage with Bootstrap nav logged out  Better yet, if you shrink the size of your browser window Bootstrap automatically resizes and makes adjustments so it looks good on a mobile device, too. You can even change the width of the web browser to see how the side margins change as the screen size increases and decreases.  If you click on the “Log Out” button and then “Log In” from the top nav you can also see that our log in page http:  127.0.0.1:8000 accounts login looks better too.  Bootstrap login   Chapter 10: Bootstrap  179  The only thing that looks off is our “Login” button. We can use Bootstrap to add some nice styling such as making it green and inviting.  Change the “button” line in templates registration login.html as follows.  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block title %}Log In{% endblock title %}  {% block content %}  Log In       {% endblock content %}  {% csrf_token %} {{ form.as_p }}  Log In   Now refresh the page to see our new button.  Bootstrap log in with new button  Sign Up Form  Our sign up page at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 accounts signup  has Bootstrap stylings but also distracting helper text. For example after “Username” it says “Required. 150 characters or fewer.   Chapter 10: Bootstrap  180  Letters, digits and @ . + - _ only.”  Updated navbar logged out  Where did that text come from, right? Whenever something feels like “magic” in Django rest assured that it is decidedly not. Likely the code came from an internal piece of Django.  The fastest method I’ve found to figure out what’s happening under-the-hood in Django is to simply go to the Django source code on Github140, use the search bar and try to find the specific piece of text.  For example, if you do a search for “150 characters or fewer” you’ll find yourself on the page for django contrib auth models.py. As of this writing, this is the link141 and the specific line is on line 334. The text comes as part of the auth app, on the username field for AbstractUser.  We have three options now:    override the existing help_text  140https:  github.com django django 141https:  github.com django django blob 7af8f4127397279d19ef7c7899e93018274e2f9b django contrib auth   models.py   Chapter 10: Bootstrap    hide the help_text   restyle the help_text  181  We’ll choose the third option since it’s a good way to introduce the excellent 3rd party package django-crispy-forms142.  Working with forms is a challenge and django-crispy-forms makes it easier to write DRY  Don’t- Repeat-Yourself  code.  First, stop the local server with Control+c. Then use Pipenv to install the package in our project.  Command Line  news  $ pipenv install django-crispy-forms==1.9.2  Add the new app to our INSTALLED_APPS list in the config settings.py file. As the number of apps starts to grow, I find it helpful to distinguish between 3rd party apps and local apps I’ve added myself. Here’s what the code looks like now.  Code  config settings.py INSTALLED_APPS = [  'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles',   3rd Party 'crispy_forms',  new   Local 'accounts', 'pages',  ]  Add a new setting for CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK, set to bootstrap4, to the bottom of our config settings.py file.  142https:  github.com django-crispy-forms django-crispy-forms   Chapter 10: Bootstrap  182  Now in our signup.html template we can quickly use crispy forms. First, we load crispy_forms_- tags at the top and then swap out {{ form.as_p }} for {{ formcrispy }}.   config settings.py CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap4'  Code  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %} {% load crispy_forms_tags %} {% block title %}Sign Up{% endblock title%}  {% block content %}  Sign Up     {% csrf_token %} {{ formcrispy }}  Sign Up      {% endblock content %}  If you start up the server again with python manage.py runserver and refresh the sign up page we can see the new changes.   Chapter 10: Bootstrap  183  Crispy sign up page  Much better. Although how about if our “Sign Up” button was a little more inviting? Maybe make it green? Bootstrap has all sorts of button styling options143 we can choose from. Let’s use the “success” one which has a green background and white text.  Update the signup.html file on the line for the sign up button.  143https:  getbootstrap.com docs 4.5 components buttons    184  Chapter 10: Bootstrap  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %} {% load crispy_forms_tags %} {% block title %}Sign Up{% endblock title%}  {% block content %}  Sign Up        {% endblock content %}  {% csrf_token %} {{ formcrispy }}  Sign Up   Refresh the page and you can see our updated work.   Chapter 10: Bootstrap  185  Crispy sign up page green button  Conclusion  Our Newspaper app is starting to look pretty good. The last step of our user auth flow is to configure password change and reset. Here again Django has taken care of the heavy lifting for us so it requires a minimal amount of code on our part.   Chapter 11: Password Change and Reset  In this chapter we will complete the authorization flow of our Newspaper app by adding password change and reset functionality. Users will be able to change their current password or, if they’ve forgotten it, to reset it via email.  Initially we will implement Django’s built-in views and URLs for both password change and password reset before then customizing them with our own Bootstrap-powered templates and email service.  Password Change  Letting users change their passwords is a common feature on many websites. Django provides a default implementation that already works at this stage. To try it out first click on the “Log In” button to make sure you’re logged in. Then navigate to the “Password change” page, which is located at:  http:  127.0.0.1:8000 accounts password_change    Chapter 11: Password Change and Reset  187  Password change  Enter in both your old password and then a new one. Then click the “Change My Password” button. You’ll be redirected to the “Password change successful” page located at:  http:  127.0.0.1:8000 accounts password_change done   Password change done   Chapter 11: Password Change and Reset  188  Customizing Password Change  Let’s customize these two password change pages so that they match the look and feel of our Newspaper site. Because Django already has created the views and URLs for us, we only need to change the templates.  On the command line stop the local server Control+c and create two new template files in the registration directory.  Command Line   news  $ touch templates registration password_change_form.html  news  $ touch templates registration password_change_done.html  Update password_change_form.html with the following code.  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block title %}Password Change{% endblock title %}  {% block content %}   Password change   Please enter your old password, for security's sake, and then enter your new password twice so we can verify you typed it in correctly.      {% csrf_token %} {{ form.as_p }} <input class="btn btn-success" type="submit"  value="Change my password">     {% endblock content %}  At the top we extend base.html and set our page title. Because we used “block” titles in our base.html file we can override them here. The form uses POST since we’re sending data and a csrf_token for security reasons. By using form.as_p we’re simply displaying in paragraphs the   Chapter 11: Password Change and Reset  189  content of the default password reset form. And finally we include a submit button that uses Bootstrap’s btn btn-success styling to make it green.  Go ahead and refresh the page at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 accounts password_change   to see our changes.  New password change form  Next up is the password_change_done template.  Code   {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block title %}Password Change Successful{% endblock title %}  {% block content %}   Password change successful   Your password was changed.   {% endblock content %}  It also extends base.html and includes a new title. However there’s no form on the page, just new text. This updated page is at:   Chapter 11: Password Change and Reset  190  http:  127.0.0.1:8000 accounts password_change done   New password change done  That wasn’t too bad, right? Certainly it was a lot less work than creating everything from scratch, especially all the code around securely updating a user’s password. Next up is the password reset functionality.  Password Reset  Password reset handles the common case of users forgetting their passwords. The steps are very similar to configuring password change, as we just did. Django already provides a default implementation that we will use and then customize the templates so it matches the look and feel of the rest of our site.  The only configuration required is telling Django how to send emails. After all, a user can only reset a password if they have access to the email linked to the account. In production, we’ll use the email service SendGrid144 to actually send the emails but for testing purposes we can rely on Django’s console backend145 setting which outputs the email text to our command line console instead.  At the bottom of the config settings.py file make the following one-line change.  144https:  sendgrid.com  145https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics email console-backend   Chapter 11: Password Change and Reset  191  Code   config settings.py EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'  And we’re all set! Django will take care of all the rest for us. Let’s try it out. Navigate to http:  127.0.0.1:8000 accounts password_reset  to view the default password reset page.  Default password reset page  Make sure the email address you enter matches one of your user accounts. Upon submission you’ll then be redirected to the password reset done page at:  http:  127.0.0.1:8000 accounts password_reset done   Default password reset done page  Which says to check our email. Since we’ve told Django to send emails to the command line console, the email text will now be there. This is what I see in my console.   Chapter 11: Password Change and Reset  192  Command Line  Content-Type: text plain; charset="utf-8" MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit Subject: Password reset on 127.0.0.1:8000 From: webmaster@localhost To: will@learndjango.com Date: Fri, 03 Aug 2020 22:41:00 -0000 Message-ID:    You're receiving this email because you requested a password reset for your user account at 127.0.0.1:8000.  Please go to the following page and choose a new password:  http:  127.0.0.1:8000 accounts reset MQ a7jdoc-d05b03730b\ 6586d76fc80d82c43de5a9   Your username, in case you've forgotten: wsv  Thanks for using our site!  The 127.0.0.1:8000 team  Your email text should be identical except for three lines:    the “To” on the sixth line contains the email address of the user    the URL link contains a secure token that Django randomly generates for us and can be  used only once    Django helpfully reminds us of our username  We will customize all of the email default text shortly but for now focus on finding the link provided and enter it into your web browser and you’ll be redirected to the “change password page”.   Chapter 11: Password Change and Reset  193  Default change password page  Now enter in a new password and click on the “Change my password” button. The final step is you’ll be redirected to the “Password reset complete” page.  Default password reset complete  To confirm everything worked, click on the “Log in” link and use your new password. It should work.  Custom Templates  As with “Password change” we only need to create new templates to customize the look and feel of password reset. Stop the local server with Control+c and then create four new template files.   Chapter 11: Password Change and Reset  194  Command Line   news  $ touch templates registration password_reset_form.html  news  $ touch templates registration password_reset_done.html  news  $ touch templates registration password_reset_confirm.html  news  $ touch templates registration password_reset_complete.html  Start with the password reset form which is password_reset_form.html.  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block title %}Forgot Your Password?{% endblock title %}  {% block content %}  Forgot your password?   Enter your email address below, and we'll email instructions for setting a new one.      {% csrf_token %} {{ form.as_p }} <input class="btn btn-success" type="submit"  value="Send me instructions!">    {% endblock content %}  At the top we extend base.html and set our page title. Because we used “block” titles in our base.html file we can override them here. The form uses POST since we’re sending data and a csrf_token for security reasons. By using form.as_p we’re simply displaying in paragraphs the content of the default password reset form. Finally we include a submit button and use Bootstrap’s btn btn-success styling to make it green.  Start up the server again with python manage.py runserver and navigate to:  http:  127.0.0.1:8000 accounts password_reset   Refresh the page you can see our new page.   Chapter 11: Password Change and Reset  195  New password reset  Now we can update the other three pages. Each takes the same form of extending base.html, a new title, new content text, and for password_reset_confirm.html an updated form as well.  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block title %}Email Sent{% endblock title %}  {% block content %}   Check your inbox.   We've emailed you instructions for setting your password. You should receive the email shortly!   {% endblock content %}  Confirm the changes by going to http:  127.0.0.1:8000 accounts password_reset done .  Next the password reset confirm page.  New reset done   Chapter 11: Password Change and Reset  196  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block title %}Enter new password{% endblock title %}  {% block content %}  Set a new password!       {% endblock content %}  {% csrf_token %} {{ form.as_p }}    In the command line grab the URL link from the email outputted to the console and you’ll see the following.  Finally here is the password reset complete code.  New set password   Chapter 11: Password Change and Reset  197  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block title %}Password reset complete{% endblock title %}  {% block content %}  Password reset complete   Your new password has been set. You can log in now on the  Log In page .  {% endblock content %}  You can view it at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 accounts reset done .  Users can now reset their account password!  New password reset complete  Conclusion  In the next chapter we will connect our Newspaper app to the email service SendGrid146 so our automated emails are actually sent to users as opposed to outputting them in the command line console.  146https:  sendgrid.com    Chapter 12: Email  At this point you may be feeling a little overwhelmed by all the user authentication configuration we’ve done up to this point. That’s normal. After all, we haven’t even created any core Newspaper app features yet! Everything has been about setting up custom user accounts and the rest.  The upside to Django’s approach is that it is incredibly easy to customize any piece of our website. The downside is that Django requires a bit more out-of-the-box code than some competing web frameworks. As you become more and more experienced in web development, the wisdom of Django’s approach will ring true.  Currently, emails are outputted to our command line console, they are not actually sent to users. Let’s change that! First we need to sign up for an account at SendGrid147 and then update our config settings.py files. Django will take care of the rest. Ready?  SendGrid  SendGrid148 is a popular service for sending transactional emails so we’ll use it. Django doesn’t care what service you choose though; you can just as easily use MailGun149 or any other service of your choice.  On the SendGrid homepage, click the “Try for free” button in the upper right corner. Enter in your email address, username, and password to create a free account. Make sure that the email account you use for SendGrid is not the same email account you have for your superuser account on the Newspaper project or weird errors may result. Finally, complete the “Tell Us About Yourself” page. The only tricky part might be the “Company Website” section. I recommend using the URL of a Heroku deployment from a previous chapter here as this setting can later be changed. Then on the bottom of the page click the “Get Started” button.  147https:  sendgrid.com  148https:  sendgrid.com  149https:  www.mailgun.com    Chapter 12: Email  199  SendGrid then presents us with a welcome screen that provides three different ways to send our first email. Select the first option, “Integrate using our Web API or SMTP relay” and click on the “Start” button next to it.  SendGrid welcome screen  Now we have one more choice to make: Web API or SMTP Relay. We’ll use SMTP150 since it is the simplest and works well for our basic needs here. In a large-scale website you likely would want to use the Web API instead but … one thing at a time.  You’ll also note the “Verify My Account” banner on the top of the page. If you want that to go away, log in to the email account you used for the account and confirm your account.  150https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol   Chapter 12: Email  200  Click on the “Choose” button under “SMTP Relay” to proceed.  SendGrid Web API vs SMTP Relay  Ok, one more screen to navigate. Under step 1, “Create an API key,” enter in a name for your first API Key. I’ve chosen the name “Newspaper” here. Then click on the blue “Create Key” button next to it.   Chapter 12: Email  201  SendGrid Integrate  The page will update and generate a custom API key in part 1. SendGrid is really pushing us to use API keys, no? But that’s ok, it will also, under part 2, create a username and password for us that we can use with an SMTP relay. This is what we want.   Chapter 12: Email  202  SendGrid username and password  The username here, apikey, is the same for everyone but the password will be different for each account. Now, time to add the new username and password into our Django project. This won’t take long!  First, in the config settings.py file update the email backend to use SMTP. We already configured this once before; the line should be at the bottom of the file. Instead of outputting emails to the console we want to instead send them for real using SMTP.   Chapter 12: Email  Code  203   config settings.py EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'  new  Then, right below it, add the following six lines of email configuration. The DEFAULT_FROM_- EMAIL151 field is set, by default, to webmaster@localhost. You should update it with your intended email account. Make sure to enter your own SendGrid EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD here; sendgrid_- password is just a placeholder!  Code   config settings.py DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'your_custom_email_account' EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.sendgrid.net' EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'apikey' EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'sendgrid_password' EMAIL_PORT = 587 EMAIL_USE_TLS = True  Also, note that ideally you would store secure information like your password in environment variables, not in plain text. But, to keep things simple, we won’t do that here. However, in a proper production environment you should.  Once complete, we’re ready to confirm everything is working. The local server should be already running at this point but if not, type python manage.py runserver to ensure that it is.  Go back to the SendGrid “Integrate using our Web API or SMTP Relay” page and select the checkbox next to “I’ve updated my settings.” Then click on “Next: Verify Integration.”  151https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref settings default-from-email   Chapter 12: Email  204  SendGrid updated settings  Navigate to the password reset form in your web browser, which should be located at:  http:  127.0.0.1:8000 accounts password_reset   Type in the email address for your superuser account. Do not use the email for your SendGrid account, which should be different. Fill in the form and submit.   Chapter 12: Email  205  SMTPDataError  Ack, what’s this? If you created a free SendGrid account after April 6, 2020, then single sender verification152 is required. Essentially, this is an additional step to help SendGrid comply with anti-spam laws. To fix it, we’ll need to follow SendGrid’s instructions153 to verify an email account. And while previously it was possible to send emails from a free address at services like gmail.com or yahoo.com, that is no longer the case due to the DMARC email authentication protocol154. So to send actual emails now you must use a custom, non-free email account which you can verify ownership of.  After completing this additional step, stop the local web server with Control+c and start it up again with our handy runserver command. Then navigate back to the password reset page and fill out the form again.  Now check your email inbox. You should see a new email there from your DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL email address which was just verified. The text will be exactly the same as that outputted to our command line console previously.  The final step is to return to SendGrid and click on the blue button to “Verify Integration.”  152https:  sendgrid.com docs ui sending-email sender-verification  153https:  sendgrid.com docs ui sending-email sender-verification  154https:  sendgrid.com docs ui sending-email dmarc    Chapter 12: Email  206  The button will turn grey and display “Checking…” for a moment until displaying “It worked!”  SendGrid verify integration   Chapter 12: Email  207  Phew. We’re done! That was a lot of steps but our real-world email integration is now working.  SendGrid it worked  Custom Emails  The current email text isn’t very personal, is it? Let’s change things. At this point I could just show you what steps to take, but I think it’s helpful if I can explain how I figured out how to do this. After all, you want to be able to customize all parts of Django as needed.  In this case, I knew what text Django was using by default but it wasn’t clear where in the Django source code it was written. And since all of Django’s source code is available on Github155 we can can just search it.  155https:  github.com django django   Chapter 12: Email  208  Github Django  Use the Github search bar and enter a few words from the email text. If you type in “You’re receiving this email because” you’ll end up at this Github search page.   Chapter 12: Email  209  Github search  The first result is the one we want. It shows the code is located in the contrib app in a file called password_reset_email.html.  django contrib admin templates registration password_reset_email.html  Here is that default text from the Django source code.   Chapter 12: Email  Code  210  {% load i18n %}{% autoescape off %} {% blocktrans %}You're receiving this email because you requested a password reset for your user account at {{ site_name }}.{% endblocktrans %}  {% trans "Please go to the following page and choose a new password:" %} {% block reset_link %} {{ protocol }}:  {{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %} {% endblock %} {% trans 'Your username, in case you’ve forgotten:' %}  {{ user.get_username }}  {% trans "Thanks for using our site!" %}  {% blocktrans %}The {{ site_name }} team{% endblocktrans %}  {% endautoescape %}  To make changes create a password_reset_email.html file in our registration directory. Stop the server with Control+c and use touch for the new file.  Command Line   news  $ touch templates registration password_reset_email.html  Then copy and paste the code from the Django repo into it. If you want to customize the text, you can.  This code might look a little scary so let’s break it down line-by-line. Up top we load the template tag i18n156 which means this text is eligible to be translated into multiple languages. Django has robust internationalization support157 though covering it is beyond the scope of this book.  We’re greeting the user by name thanks to user.get_username. Then we use the reset_link block to include the custom URL link. You can read more about Django’s password management approach158 in the official docs.  156https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref templates builtins i18n 157https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics i18n  158https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth passwords    Let’s also update the email’s subject title. To do this we’ll create another new file called password_reset_subject.txt.  211  Chapter 12: Email  Command Line   news  $ touch templates registration password_reset_subject.txt  Then add the following line of code to the password_reset_subject.txt file.  password_reset_subject.txt  Please reset your password  And we’re all set. Go ahead and try out our new flow again by entering a new password at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 accounts password_reset . Then check your email and it will have the desired content and updated subject.  Conclusion  We’ve now finished implementing a complete user authentication flow. Users can sign up for a new account, log in, log out, change their password, and reset their password. It’s time to build out our actual Newspaper app.   Chapter 13: Newspaper App  It’s time to build out our Newspaper app. We’ll have an articles page where journalists can post articles, set up permissions so only the author of an article can edit or delete it, and finally add the ability for other users to write comments on each article which will introduce the concept of foreign keys.  Articles App  To start create an articles app and define our database models. There are no hard and fast rules around what to name your apps except that you can’t use the name of a built-in app. If you look at the INSTALLED_APPS section of config settings.py you can see which app names are off-limits: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions, messages, and staticfiles. A general rule of thumb is to use the plural of an app name–posts, payments, users, etc.–unless doing so is obviously wrong as in the common case of blog where the singular makes more sense.  Start by creating our new articles app.  Command Line   news  $ python manage.py startapp articles  Then add it to our INSTALLED_APPS and update the time zone since we’ll be timestamping our articles. You can find your time zone in this Wikipedia list159. For example, I live in Boston, MA which is in the Eastern time zone of the United States. Therefore my entry is America New_York.  159https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki List_of_tz_database_time_zones   213  Chapter 13: Newspaper App  Code   config settings.py INSTALLED_APPS = [  'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles',   3rd Party 'crispy_forms',   Local 'accounts', 'pages', 'articles',  new  ]  TIME_ZONE = 'America New_York'  new  Next up we define our database model which contains four fields: title, body, date, and author. Note that we’re letting Django automatically set the time and date based on our TIME_ZONE set- ting. For the author field we want to reference our custom user model160 'accounts.CustomUser' which we set in the config settings.py file as AUTH_USER_MODEL.  We can do this via get_user_model161. And we also implement the best practices of defining a get_absolute_url from the beginning and a __str__ method for viewing the model in our admin interface.  160https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth customizing django.contrib.auth.get_user_model 161https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth customizing django.contrib.auth.get_user_model   214  Chapter 13: Newspaper App  Code   articles models.py from django.conf import settings from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model from django.db import models from django.urls import reverse  class Article models.Model :  title = models.CharField max_length=255  body = models.TextField   date = models.DateTimeField auto_now_add=True  author = models.ForeignKey   get_user_model  , on_delete=models.CASCADE,     def __str__ self :  return self.title  def get_absolute_url self :  return reverse 'article_detail', args=[str self.id ]   Since we have a brand new app and model, it’s time to make a new migration file and then apply it to the database.  Command Line   news  $ python manage.py makemigrations articles  news  $ python manage.py migrate  At this point I like to jump into the admin to play around with the model before building out the urls views templates needed to actually display the data on the website. But first we need to update articles admin.py so our new app is displayed.   Chapter 13: Newspaper App  215  Code   articles admin.py from django.contrib import admin from .models import Article  admin.site.register Article   Now we start the server.  Command Line   news  $ python manage.py runserver  Navigate to http:  127.0.0.1:8000 admin  and log in.  Admin page  If you click on “+ Add” next to “Articles” at the top of the page we can enter in some sample data. You’ll likely have three users available at this point: your superuser, testuser, and testuser2 accounts. Use your superuser account as the author of all three articles.   Chapter 13: Newspaper App  216  I’ve added three new articles as you can see on the updated Articles page.  Admin articles add page   Chapter 13: Newspaper App  217  Admin three articles  If you click on an individual article you will see that the title, body, and author are displayed but not the date. That’s because the date was automatically added by Django for us and therefore can’t be changed in the admin. We could make the date editable–in more complex apps it’s common to have both a created_at and updated_at field–but to keep things simple we’ll just have the date be set upon creation by Django for us for now. Even though date is not displayed here we will still be able to access it in our templates so it can be displayed on web pages.  URLs and Views  The next step is to configure our URLs and views. Let’s have our articles appear at articles . Add a URL pattern for articles in our config urls.py file.   Chapter 13: Newspaper App  218  Code   config urls.py from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import path, include  urlpatterns = [  path 'admin ', admin.site.urls , path 'accounts ', include 'accounts.urls'  , path 'accounts ', include 'django.contrib.auth.urls'  , path 'articles ', include 'articles.urls'  ,  new path '', include 'pages.urls'  ,  Next we create an articles urls.py file.  Command Line   news  $ touch articles urls.py  Then populate it with our routes. Let’s start with the page to list all articles at articles  which will use the view ArticleListView.  Code   articles urls.py from django.urls import path from .views import ArticleListView  urlpatterns = [  path '', ArticleListView.as_view  , name='article_list' ,  Now create our view using the built-in generic ListView from Django.  ]  ]   Chapter 13: Newspaper App  219  Code   articles views.py from django.views.generic import ListView from .models import Article  class ArticleListView ListView :  model = Article template_name = 'article_list.html'  The only two fields we need to specify are the model Article and our template name which will be article_list.html.  The last step is to create our template. We can make an empty file from the command line.  Command Line   news  $ touch templates article_list.html  Bootstrap has a built-in component called Cards162 that we can customize for our individual articles. Recall that ListView returns an object called object_list which we can iterate over using a for loop.  Within each article we display the title, body, author, and date. We can even provide links to “edit” and “delete” functionality that we haven’t built yet.  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block title %}Articles{% endblock title %}  {% block content %}  {% for article in object_list %}         {{ article.title }}  &middot;  by {{ article.author }}  {{ article.date }}   162https:  getbootstrap.com docs 4.5 components card    Chapter 13: Newspaper App  220       {{ article.body }}       Edit    Delete           {% endfor %}  {% endblock content %}  Spin up the server again with python manage.py runserver and check out our page at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 articles .  Articles page  Not bad eh? If we wanted to get fancy we could create a custom template filter163 so that the  163https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 howto custom-template-tags    Chapter 13: Newspaper App  221  date outputted is shown in seconds, minutes, or days. This can be done with some if else logic and Django’s date options164 but we won’t implement it here.  How do we add edit and delete options? We need new urls, views, and templates. Let’s start with the urls. We can take advantage of the fact that Django automatically adds a primary key to each database. Therefore our first article with a primary key of 1 will be at articles 1 edit  and the delete route will be at articles 1 delete .  Edit Delete  Code   articles urls.py from django.urls import path from .views import   ArticleListView, ArticleUpdateView,  new ArticleDetailView,  new ArticleDeleteView,  new  urlpatterns = [  path '  edit ',  path '  ',  path '  delete ',     ]  ArticleUpdateView.as_view  , name='article_edit' ,  new  ArticleDetailView.as_view  , name='article_detail' ,  new  ArticleDeleteView.as_view  , name='article_delete' ,  new  path '', ArticleListView.as_view  , name='article_list' ,  Now write up our views which will use Django’s generic class-based views for DetailView, UpdateView and DeleteView. We specify which fields can be updated–title and body–and where to redirect the user after deleting an article: article_list.  164https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref templates builtins date   Chapter 13: Newspaper App  Code   articles views.py from django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView  new from django.views.generic.edit import UpdateView, DeleteView  new from django.urls import reverse_lazy  new from .models import Article  222  class ArticleListView ListView :  model = Article template_name = 'article_list.html'  class ArticleDetailView DetailView :  new  model = Article template_name = 'article_detail.html'  class ArticleUpdateView UpdateView :  new  model = Article fields =  'title', 'body',  template_name = 'article_edit.html'  class ArticleDeleteView DeleteView :  new  model = Article template_name = 'article_delete.html' success_url = reverse_lazy 'article_list'   Command Line   news  $ touch templates article_detail.html  news  $ touch templates article_edit.html  news  $ touch templates article_delete.html  Finally we need to add our new templates. Stop the server with Control+c and type the following.  We’ll start with the details page which will display the title, date, body, and author with links to edit and delete. It will also link back to all articles. Recall that the Django templating language’s url tag wants the URL name and then any arguments passed in. The name of our edit route is article_edit and we need to pass in its primary key article.pk. The delete route name is   Chapter 13: Newspaper App  223  article_delete and it also needs a primary key article.pk. Our articles page is a ListView so it does not need any additional arguments passed in.  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block content %}      {{ object.title }}   by {{ object.author }}  {{ object.date }}   {{ object.body }}        Edit     Delete     Back to  All Articles .   {% endblock content %}  For the edit and delete pages we can use Bootstrap’s button styling165 to make the edit button light blue and the delete button red.  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block content %}   Edit   {% csrf_token %}  {{ form.as_p }}  Update      {% endblock content %}  165https:  getbootstrap.com docs 4.5 components buttons    Chapter 13: Newspaper App  224  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block content %}   Delete   {% csrf_token %}   Are you sure you want to delete "{{ article.title }}"?   Confirm      {% endblock content %}  As a final step, in the card-footer section of article_list.html we can swap out the " placeholder a hrefs in place of the actual URL routes, using the url166 template tag, the URL name, and as a parameter the pk of each.    ...     Edit    Delete   Code    ...  Ok, we’re ready to view our work. Start up the server with python manage.py runserver and navigate to articles page at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 articles . Click on the link for “edit” on the first article and you’ll be redirected to http:  127.0.0.1:8000 articles 1 edit .  166https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref templates builtins url   Chapter 13: Newspaper App  225  Edit page  If you update the “title” field by adding “ edited”  at the end and click update you’ll be redirected to the detail page which shows the new change.  If you click on the “Delete” link you’ll be redirected to the delete page.  Detail page   Chapter 13: Newspaper App  226  Delete page  Press the scary red button for “Delete” and you’ll be redirected to the articles page which now only has two entries.  Articles page two entries  Create Page  The final step is a create page for new articles which we can do with Django’s CreateView. Our three steps are to create a view, url, and template. This flow should feel pretty familiar by now.  In our views file add CreateView to the imports at the top and make a new class at the bottom of the file ArticleCreateView that specifies our model, template, and the fields available.   Chapter 13: Newspaper App  227  Code  articles views.py ... from django.views.generic.edit import    UpdateView, DeleteView, CreateView  new    ... class ArticleCreateView CreateView :  new  model = Article template_name = 'article_new.html' fields =  'title', 'body', 'author',   Note that our fields has author since we want to associate a new article with an author, however once an article has been created we do not want a user to be able to change the author which is why ArticleUpdateView only has the fields ['title', 'body',].  Update our urls file with the new route for the view.  Code  articles urls.py from django.urls import path  from .views import   ArticleListView, ArticleUpdateView, ArticleDetailView, ArticleDeleteView, ArticleCreateView,  new     ]  urlpatterns = [  path '  edit ',  path '  ',  path '  delete ',  ArticleUpdateView.as_view  , name='article_edit' ,  ArticleDetailView.as_view  , name='article_detail' ,  ArticleDeleteView.as_view  , name='article_delete' ,  path 'new ', ArticleCreateView.as_view  , name='article_new' ,  new path '', ArticleListView.as_view  , name='article_list' ,  Then quit the server Control+c to create a new template named article_new.html.   Chapter 13: Newspaper App  228  Command Line  news  $ touch templates article_new.html  And update it with the following HTML code.  Code   {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block content %}   New article   {% csrf_token %}  {{ form.as_p }}  Save      {% endblock content %}  Finally, we should add a link to creating new articles in our navbar so it is accessible everywhere on the site to logged-in users.  Code          Newspaper  {% if user.is_authenticated %}         + New         {% endif %} ...  If you need help to make sure your HTML file is accurate now, please refer to the official source code167.  Refresh the articles page and the change is evident in the top navbar:  167https:  github.com wsvincent djangoforbeginners blob master ch13-newspaper-app templates base.html   Chapter 13: Newspaper App  229  Navbar new link  Why not use Bootstrap to improve our original homepage now, too? We can update the template for home.html as follows.  Code    {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block title %}Home{% endblock title %}  {% block content %}        Newspaper app   A Newspaper website built with Django.     <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="{% url 'article_list' %}" role="button">View All Articles        {% endblock content %}  We’re all done. Let’s just confirm everything works as expected. Navigate to our homepage at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 .   Chapter 13: Newspaper App  230  Click on the link for “+ New” in the top navbar and you’ll be redirected to our create page.  Homepage with new link in nav  Create page   Chapter 13: Newspaper App  231  Go ahead and create a new article. Then click on the “Save” button. You will be redirected to the detail page. Why? Because in our models.py file we set the get_absolute_url method to article_detail. This is a good approach because if we later change the url pattern for the detail page to, say, articles details 4 , the redirect will still work. Whatever route is associated with article_detail will be used. There is no hardcoding of the route itself.  Detail page  Note also that the primary key here is 4 in the URL. Even though we’re only displaying three articles right now, Django doesn’t reorder the primary keys just because we deleted one. In practice, most real-world sites don’t actually delete anything; instead they “hide” deleted fields since this makes it easier to maintain the integrity of a database and gives the option to “undelete” later on if needed. With our current approach once something is deleted it’s gone for good!  Click on the link for “All Articles” to see our new  articles page.   Chapter 13: Newspaper App  232  There’s our new article on the bottom as expected.  Updated articles page  Conclusion  We have created a dedicated articles app with CRUD functionality. But there are no permissions or authorizations yet, which means anyone can do anything! A logged-out user can visit all URLs and any logged-in user can make edits or deletes to an existing article, even one that’s not their own! In the next chapter we will add permissions and authorizations to our project to fix this.   Chapter 14: Permissions and Authorization  There are several issues with our current Newspaper website. For one thing we want our newspaper to be financially sustainable. With more time we could add a payments app to charge for access, but for now we will require a user to log in to view any articles. This is known as authorization. It’s common to set different rules around who is authorized to view areas of your site. Note that this is different than authentication which is the process of registering and logging-in users. Authorization restricts access; authentication enables a user sign up and log in flow.  As a mature web framework, Django has built-in functionality for authorization that we can quickly use. In this chapter we’ll limit access to various pages only to logged-in users.  Improved CreateView  At present the author on a new article can be set to any user. Instead it should be automatically set to the current user. The default CreateView provides a lot of functionality for us but in order to set the current user to author we need to customize it. We will remove author from the fields and instead set it automatically via the form_valid method.  Code  ...   articles views.py ... class ArticleCreateView CreateView :  model = Article template_name = 'article_new.html' fields =  'title', 'body'   new  def form_valid self, form :  new  form.instance.author = self.request.user return super  .form_valid form    Chapter 14: Permissions and Authorization  234  How did I know I could update CreateView like this? The answer is I looked at the source code and used Google. Generic class-based views are amazing for starting new projects but when you want to customize them, it is necessary roll up your sleeves and start to understand what’s going on under the hood. The more you use and customize built-in views, the more comfortable you will become making customizations like this.  Now reload the browser and try clicking on the “+ New” link in the top nav. It will redirect to the updated create page where author is no longer a field.  New article link  If you create a new article and then go into the admin you will see it is automatically set to the current logged-in user.  Authorizations  There are multiple issues around the lack of authorizations in our current project. Obviously we would like to restrict access to only users so we have the option of one day charging readers to our newspaper. But beyond that, any random logged-out user who knows the correct URL can   Chapter 14: Permissions and Authorization  235  access any part of the site.  Consider what would happen if a logged-out user tried to create a new article? To try it out, click on your username in the upper right corner of the nav bar, then select “Log out” from the dropdown options. The “+ New” link disappears from the nav bar but what happens if you go to it directly: http:  127.0.0.1:8000 articles new ?  The page is still there.  Now try to create a new article with a title and body. Click on the “Save” button.  Logged out new   Chapter 14: Permissions and Authorization  236  Create page error  An error! This is because our model expects an author field which is linked to the current logged- in user. But since we are not logged in, there’s no author, and therefore the submission fails. What to do?  Mixins  We clearly want to set some authorizations so only logged-in users can access the site. To do this we can use a mixin, which is a special kind of multiple inheritance that Django uses to avoid duplicate code and still allows customization. For example, the built-in generic ListView168 needs a way to return a template. But so does DetailView169 and in fact almost every other view. Rather than repeat the same code in each big generic view, Django breaks out this functionality into a “mixin” known as TemplateResponseMixin170. Both ListView and DetailView use this mixin to render the proper template.  If you read the Django source code, which is freely available on Github171, you’ll see mixins used  168https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref class-based-views generic-display django.views.generic.list.  ListView  169https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref class-based-views generic-display detailview 170https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.‘0‘ ref class-based-views mixins-simple templateresponsemixin 171https:  github.com django django   Chapter 14: Permissions and Authorization  237  all over the place. To restrict view access to only logged in users, Django has a LoginRequired mixin172 that we can use. It’s powerful and extremely concise.  In the articles views.py file, import LoginRequiredMixin at the top and then it add to our ArticleCreateView. Make sure that the mixin is to the left of CreateView so it will be read first. We want the CreateView to already know we intend to restrict access.  And that’s it! We’re done.  Code  articles views.py from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin  new from django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView from django.views.generic.edit import UpdateView, DeleteView, CreateView from django.urls import reverse_lazy  from .models import Article  ...  ...  class ArticleCreateView LoginRequiredMixin, CreateView :  new  Now return to the homepage briefly at http:  127.0.0.1:8000  so we avoid resubmitting the form. Then go to our new message URL directly again at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 articles new . You’ll see the following “Page not found” error:  172https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth default the-loginrequired-mixin  Error page   Chapter 14: Permissions and Authorization  238  What’s happening? Django has automatically redirected users to the log in page, just as we desired!  LoginRequiredMixin  Now we see that restricting view access requires adding LoginRequiredMixin at the beginning of all existing views and specifying the correct login_url. Let’s update the rest of our articles views since we don’t want a user to be able to create, read, update, or delete a message if they aren’t logged in.  The complete views.py file should now look like this:  Code  articles views.py from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin from django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView, UpdateView, DeleteView from django.urls import reverse_lazy from .models import Article  class ArticleListView LoginRequiredMixin, ListView :  new  model = Article template_name = 'article_list.html'  class ArticleDetailView LoginRequiredMixin, DetailView :  new  model = Article template_name = 'article_detail.html'  class ArticleUpdateView LoginRequiredMixin, UpdateView :  new  model = Article fields =  'title', 'body',  template_name = 'article_edit.html'  class ArticleDeleteView LoginRequiredMixin, DeleteView :  new  model = Article template_name = 'article_delete.html' success_url = reverse_lazy 'article_list'    Chapter 14: Permissions and Authorization  239  class ArticleCreateView LoginRequiredMixin, CreateView :  model = Article template_name = 'article_new.html' fields =  'title', 'body',   def form_valid self, form :  form.instance.author = self.request.user return super  .form_valid form   Go ahead and play around with the site to confirm that the log in redirects now work as expected. If you need help recalling what the proper URLs are, log in first and write down the URLs for each of the routes for create, edit, delete, and all articles.  UpdateView and DeleteView  We’re making progress but there’s still the issue of our edit and delete views. Any logged in user can make changes to any article. What we want is to restrict this access so that only the author of an article has this permission.  We could add permissions logic to each view for this but a more elegant solution is to create a dedicated mixin, a class with a particular feature that we want to reuse in our Django code. And better yet, Django ships with a built-in mixin, UserPassesTestMixin173, just for this purpose!  To use UserPassesTestMixin, first import it at the top of the articles views.py file and then add it to both the update and delete views where we want this restriction.  The test_func method is used by UserPassesTestMixin for our logic. We need to override it. In this case we set the variable obj to the current object returned by the view using get_object  . Then we say, if the author on the current object matches the current user on the webpage  whoever is logged in and trying to make the change , then allow it. If false, an error will automatically be thrown.  The code looks like this:  UserPassesTestMixin  173https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics auth default django.contrib.auth.mixins.   Chapter 14: Permissions and Authorization  240   articles views.py from django.contrib.auth.mixins import    LoginRequiredMixin, UserPassesTestMixin  new    from django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView from django.views.generic.edit import UpdateView, DeleteView, CreateView from django.urls import reverse_lazy from .models import Article  Code  ...  class ArticleUpdateView   LoginRequiredMixin, UserPassesTestMixin, UpdateView  :  new  model = Article fields =  'title', 'body',  template_name = 'article_edit.html'  def test_func self :  new obj = self.get_object   return obj.author == self.request.user  class ArticleDeleteView   LoginRequiredMixin, UserPassesTestMixin, DeleteView  :  new  model = Article template_name = 'article_delete.html' success_url = reverse_lazy 'article_list'   def test_func self :  new obj = self.get_object   return obj.author == self.request.user  Now log out of your superuser account and log in with testuser. If the code works, then you should not be able to edit or delete any posts written by your superuser, which is all of them right now. Instead you will see a Permission Denied 403 error page.   Chapter 14: Permissions and Authorization  241  403 error page  Conclusion  Our Newspaper app is almost done. There are further steps we could take at this point, such as only displaying edit and delete links to the appropriate users, which would involve custom template tags174 but overall the app is in good shape. We have our articles properly configured, set permissions and authorizations, and user authentication is in order. The last item needed is the ability for fellow logged-in users to leave comments which we’ll cover in the next chapter.  174https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 howto custom-template-tags    Chapter 15: Comments  There are two ways we could add comments to our Newspaper site. The first is to create a dedicated comments app and link it to articles, however that seems like over-engineering at this point. Instead, we can simply add an additional model called Comment to our articles app and link it to the Article model through a foreign key. We will take the simpler approach since it’s always easy to add more complexity later. By the end of this chapter users will have the ability to leave comments on any other users articles.  To start we can add another table to our existing database called Comment. This model will have a many-to-one foreign key relationship to Article: one article can have many comments, but not the other way around. Traditionally the name of the foreign key field is simply the model it links to, so this field will be called article. The other two fields will be comment and author.  Open up the file articles models.py and underneath the existing code add the following.  Model  Code   articles models.py ...  class Comment models.Model :  new  article = models.ForeignKey Article, on_delete=models.CASCADE  comment = models.CharField max_length=140  author = models.ForeignKey   get_user_model  , on_delete=models.CASCADE,     def __str__ self :  return self.comment   Chapter 15: Comments  243  def get_absolute_url self :  return reverse 'article_list'   Our Comment model also has a __str__ method and a get_absolute_url method that returns to the main articles  page.  Since we’ve updated our models it’s time to make a new migration file and then apply it. Note that by adding articles at the end of the makemigrations command–which is optional–we are specifying we want to use just the articles app here. This is a good habit to use. For example, what if we made changes to models in two different apps? If we did not specify an app, then both apps’ changes would be incorporated in the same migrations file which makes it harder, in the future, to debug errors. Keep each migration as small and contained as possible.  Command Line   news  $ python manage.py makemigrations articles  news  $ python manage.py migrate  After making a new model it’s good to play around with it in the admin app before displaying it on our actual website. Add Comment to our admin.py file so it will be visible.  Admin  Code   articles admin.py from django.contrib import admin from .models import Article, Comment  new  admin.site.register Article  admin.site.register Comment   new  Then start up the server with python manage.py runserver and navigate to our main page http:  127.0.0.1:8000 admin .   Chapter 15: Comments  244  Admin page with Comments  Under our app “Articles” you’ll see our two tables: Comments and Articles. Click on the “+ Add” next to Comments. You’ll see that under Article is a dropdown of existing articles, same thing for Author, and there is a text field next to Comment.  Select an Article, write a comment, and then select an author that is not your superuser, perhaps  Admin Comments   Chapter 15: Comments  245  testuser as I’ve done in the picture. Then click on the “Save” button.  You should next see your comment on the “Comments” page.  Admin testuser comment  Admin Comment One  At this point we could add an additional admin field so we’d see the comment and the article on this page. But wouldn’t it be better to just see all Comment models related to a single Post model? It turns out we can with a Django admin feature called inlines which displays foreign key   Chapter 15: Comments  relationships in a nice, visual way.  246  There are two main inline views used: TabularInline175 and StackedInline176. The only difference between the two is the template for displaying information. In a TabularInline all model fields appear on one line while in a StackedInline each field has its own line. We’ll implement both so you can decide which one you prefer.  Update articles admin.py as follows in your text editor.  Code   articles admin.py from django.contrib import admin from .models import Article, Comment  class CommentInline admin.StackedInline :  new  model = Comment  class ArticleAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :  new  inlines = [  CommentInline,  ]  admin.site.register Article, ArticleAdmin   new admin.site.register Comment   Now go back to the main admin page at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 admin  and click on “Articles.” Select the article which you just added a comment for which was “4th article” in my case.  175https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref contrib admin django.contrib.admin.TabularInline 176https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 ref contrib admin django.contrib.admin.StackedInline   Chapter 15: Comments  247  Admin change page   Chapter 15: Comments  248  Better, right? We can see and modify all our related articles and comments in one place. Note that by default, the Django admin will display 3 empty rows here. You can change the default number that appear with the extra field. So if you wanted no fields by default, the code would look like this:  Personally, though, I prefer using TabularInline as it shows more information in less space. To switch to it we only need to change our CommentInline from admin.StackedInline to admin.TabularInline.   articles admin.py ... class CommentInline admin.StackedInline :  model = Comment extra = 0  new  Code  Code   articles admin.py from django.contrib import admin from .models import Article, Comment  class CommentInline admin.TabularInline :  new  model = Comment  class ArticleAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :  inlines = [  CommentInline,  ]  admin.site.register Article, ArticleAdmin  admin.site.register Comment   Refresh the admin page and you’ll see the new change: all fields for each model are displayed on the same line.   Chapter 15: Comments  249  Much better. Now we need to update our template to display comments.  TabularInline page  Template  Since Comment lives within our existing articles app we only need to update the existing templates for article_list.html and article_detail.html to display our new content. We   Chapter 15: Comments  250  don’t have to create new templates and mess around with URLs and views.  What we want to do is display all comments related to a specific article. This is called a “query” as we’re asking the database for a specific bit of information. In our case, working with a foreign key, we want to follow a relationship backward177: for each Article look up related Comment models.  Django has a built-in syntax for following relationships “backward”178 known as FOO_set where FOO is the lowercased source model name. So for our Article model we can use article_set to access all instances of the model.  But personally I strongly dislike this syntax as I find it confusing and non-intuitive. A better approach is to add a related_name attribute to our model which lets us explicitly set the name of this reverse relationship instead. Let’s do that.  To start, add a related_name attribute to our Comment model. A good default is to name it the plural of the model holding the ForeignKey.  Code  articles models.py ... class Comment models.Model :  article = models.ForeignKey   Article, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='comments',  new    comment = models.CharField max_length=140  author = models.ForeignKey   get_user_model  , on_delete=models.CASCADE,     def __str__ self :  return self.comment  def get_absolute_url self :  return reverse 'article_list'   Since we just made a change to our database model we need to create a migrations file and update  177https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics db queries following-relationships-backward 178https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 topics db queries following-relationships-backward   Chapter 15: Comments  251  the database. Stop the local server with Control+c and execute the following two commands. Then spin up the server again as we will be using it shortly.  Command Line  news  $ python manage.py makemigrations articles Migrations for 'articles':  articles migrations 0003_auto_20200726_1405.py  - Alter field article on comment   news  $ python manage.py migrate Operations to perform:  Running migrations:  Applying articles.0003_auto_20200726_1405... OK   news  $ python manage.py runserver  Apply all migrations: admin, articles, auth, contenttypes, sessions, users  Understanding queries takes some time so don’t be concerned if the idea of reverse relationships is confusing. I’ll show you how to implement the code as desired. And once you’ve mastered these basic cases you can explore how to filter your querysets in great detail so they return exactly the information you want.  In our article_list.html file we can add our comments to the card-footer. Note that I’ve moved our edit and delete links up into card-body. To access each comment we’re calling article.comments.all which means first look at the article model, then comments which is the related name of the entire Comment model, and select all included. It can take a little while to become accustomed to this syntax for referencing foreign key data in a template!  Code   {% extends 'base.html' %}  {% block title %}Articles{% endblock title %}  {% block content %}  {% for article in object_list %}         {{ article.title }}  &middot;  by {{ article.author }}  {{ article.date }}       Chapter 15: Comments  252        {{ article.body }}   Edit    Delete        {% for comment in article.comments.all %}       {{ comment.author }} &middot;    {{ comment }}     {% endfor %}            {% endfor %}  {% endblock content %}  If you refresh the articles page at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 articles  we can see our new comment displayed on the page.   Chapter 15: Comments  253  Articles page with comments  Yoohoo! It works. We can see comments listed underneath the initial message.  With more time we would focus on forms now so a user could write a new article directly on the articles  page, as well as add comments too. But the main focus of this chapter is to demonstrate how foreign key relationships work in Django.  Conclusion  Our Newspaper app is now complete. It has a robust user authentication flow that uses a custom user model and email. Improved styling thanks to Bootstrap. And both articles and comments. We even tipped our toes into permissions and authorizations.  Our remaining task is to deploy it online. Our deployment process has grown in complexity with   Chapter 15: Comments  254  each successive application, but we’re still taking shortcuts around security and performance. In the next chapter, we’ll see how to properly deploy a Django site by using environment variables, PostgreSQL, and additional settings.   Chapter 16: Deployment  Fundamentally, there is a tension between the ease-of-use desired in a local Django development environment and the security and performance necessary in a production environment. Django is designed to make web developers’ lives easier and it therefore defaults to a local configuration when the startproject command is first run.  But as we’ve already seen in our projects, deployment requires additional packages and config- urations. Here is the complete deployment checklist last used for the Blog app back in Chapter 7:    configure static files, install whitenoise, and run collectstatic   update ALLOWED_HOSTS   install Gunicorn as the production web server   create a Procfile    create a new Heroku project and push the code to Heroku   run heroku ps:scale web=1 to start a dyno web process  In truth, though, this list is far from complete. We’ve still been making a number of shortcuts in our deployments that need to be fixed. As the Django deployment checklist179 notes, at the very minimum, a production environment should also have:    DEBUG set to False   SECRET_KEY actually kept secret    a production database, not SQLite  The question is: how do we balance both of these needs? One environment for local development and another for production? Today, the best practice is to use environment variables180, which  179https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 howto deployment checklist  180https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Environment_variable   Chapter 16: Deployment  256  can be loaded into the codebase at runtime yet not stored in the source code. In other words, even if someone had access to your Github repo and all the source code, they couldn’t do much damage because the environment variables representing the most important details would be stored elsewhere!  In this final chapter we will switch over to environment variables and create a deployment checklist suitable for a professional website.  Environment Variables  There are multiple ways to work with environment variables in Python but for this project we’ll use the environs181 package. It allows us to create a dedicated .env file for environment variables as well as load a number of Django-specific additional packages which help with configuration.  On the command line, install environs[django]. Note that you’ll probably need to add single quotes '' around the package if you’re using Zsh as your terminal shell, so run pipenv install 'environs[django]==8.0.0'.  Command Line   news  $ pipenv install 'environs[django]==8.0.0'  Then, in the config settings.py file, there are three lines of imports to add at the top of the file.  Code   config settings.py from environs import Env  new  env = Env    new env.read_env    new  181https:  github.com sloria environs  Next up, create a new file called .env in the same folder that contains .manage.py.   257  Chapter 16: Deployment  Command Line   news  $ touch .env  .gitignore  Any file that starts with a dot, such as .env, is treated as a hidden file182, meaning it won’t be displayed by default during a directory listing. To prove this, try typing the ls command. You’ll see all the files and directories listed, but not the “hidden” .env file.  We’re using Git for source control, but we don’t want it to track every file in our project. For example, the reason we create a dedicated .env file is so that it will be secret, not stored in our source code.  Fortunately, there is a way to identify which files and folders we want Git to ignore. Create a new file called .gitignore file in the same folder that contains .env and manage.py.  Command Line   news  $ touch .gitignore  While we’re at it, there are several other files and folders that are convenient to ignore. This includes the __pycache__ directory, containing .pyc files created automatically whenever Django runs .py files. The db.sqlite3 file, since it’s a bad practice to track our SQLite database as it might accidentally be pushed to production. And as a final step, if you’re on a Mac, there’s no need to track .DS_Store, which stores information about folder settings on MacOS.  Here is what the final .gitignore file should contain:  182https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory   Chapter 16: Deployment  .gitignore .env __pycache__  db.sqlite3 .DS_Store  Mac only  258  If you’re curious, Github maintains an official Python gitignore file183 containing additional configurations.  If you run git status now you’ll see that .env is no longer tracked. That’s the behavior we want!  DEBUG & ALLOWED HOSTS  It’s time to configure our environment variable for DEBUG, which by default is set to True. This is helpful for local development, but a major security issue if deployed into production. For example, if you start up the local server with python manage.py runserver and navigate to a page that does not exist, like http:  127.0.0.1:8000 debug, you’ll see the following:  Page Not Found  This page lists all the URLconfs tried and apps loaded, which is a treasure map for any hacker attempting to break into your site. You’ll even see that on the bottom of the error page, it says that Django will display a standard 404 page if DEBUG=False. Within the config settings.py file, change DEBUG to be False.  183https:  github.com github gitignore blob master Python.gitignore   Chapter 16: Deployment  Code  config settings.py DEBUG = False  259  Oops! If you look at the command line, Django is complaining about a CommandError and has automatically stopped the local server.  Command Line CommandError: You must set settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS if DEBUG is False.  Because DEBUG is set to False, Django assumes we’re trying to push the project into production and comes with a number of warnings like this. ALLOWED_HOSTS should be set to accept both local ports  localhost and 127.0.0.1  as well as .herokuapp.com for its Heroku deployment. We can add all three routes to our config.  Code  config settings.py ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['.herokuapp.com', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1']  Re-run the python manage.py runserver command and refresh the page. The descriptive error message is no longer there! Instead, it has been replaced by a generic “Not Found” message.  Not Found  Our goal is for DEBUG to be True for local development, but set to False in production. The two-step process for adding any environment variable is to first add the it to .env and then to config settings.py.  Within the .env file, add the line export DEBUG=True. This syntax of exporting both the variable name and its value will be used for all environment variables.   260  Then in config settings.py, change the DEBUG setting to read the variable "DEBUG" from the .env file.  It’s easy to be confused here. Our environment variable is named DEBUG, the same as the setting it replaces. But we could have named our environment variable ANYTHING instead. That would have looked like this:  Chapter 16: Deployment  .env  export DEBUG=True  Code   config settings.py DEBUG = env.bool "DEBUG"   export ANYTHING=True  .env  Code   config settings.py DEBUG = env.bool "ANYTHING"   ANYTHING is a variable so it can have almost any name we desire. In practice, however, most developers will name the environment variable to match the name of the setting it replaces. We will do the same so export DEBUG=True. { aside}  One more best practice we will adopt is to set a default value, in this case False, meaning that if an environment variable can’t be found, our production setting will be used. It’s a best practice to default to production settings since they are more secure and if something goes wrong in our code, we won’t default to exposing all our secrets out in the open.  The final config settings.py line therefore looks as follows:   Chapter 16: Deployment  Code   config settings.py DEBUG = env.bool "DEBUG", default=False   261  If you refresh the webpage at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 debug, you’ll see the full error page is back again. Everything is working properly.  SECRET_KEY  The next environment variable to set is our SECRET_KEY, a random 50 character string generated each time startproject is run. Your value will differ from mine below, but not that the enclosing single quotes that make it a string '' should not be included. In other words, here is the config settings.py value of the SECRET_KEY.   config settings.py SECRET_KEY = 'yq@=cjw8z@ssx7_3ukfoi9j3di m-km8=^x9a  p2 3y-24g%*'  And here it is, without single quotes, in the .env file.  Code  .env  export DEBUG=True export SECRET_KEY=yq@=cjw8z@ssx7_3ukfoi9j3di m-km8=^x9a  p2 3y-24g%*  Since we deliberately haven’t made any Git commits yet, this value is “safe” and not stored in source control. If you have made previous Git commits, you’ll need to generate a new SECRET_- KEY for security reasons. One way to do so is by invoking Python’s built-in secrets184 module by running python -c 'import secrets; print secrets.token_urlsafe   ' on the command line. { aside}  Update config settings.py so that SECRET_KEY points to this new environment variable. We won’t set a default value.  184https:  docs.python.org 3 library secrets.html   Chapter 16: Deployment  262  Code   config settings.py SECRET_KEY = env.str "SECRET_KEY"   Now restart the local server with python manage.py runserver and refresh your website. It will work with SECRET_KEY loaded from our .env file.  DATABASES  Our current DATABASES configuration is for SQLite, but we want to be able to switch to PostgreSQL for production on Heroku. When we installed environs[django] earlier, the Django “goodies” included the elegant dj-database-url185 package, which takes all the database configu- rations needed for our database, SQLite or PostgreSQL, and creates a DATABASE_URL environment variable.  Our updated DATABASES configuration uses dj_db_url from environs[django] to help parse DATABASE_URL and looks as follows:   config settings.py DATABASES = {  "default": env.dj_db_url "DATABASE_URL"   Code  }  .env  That’s it! All we need to do now is specify SQL as the local DATABASE_URL value in the .env file.  export DEBUG=True export SECRET_KEY=yq@=cjw8z@ssx7_3ukfoi9j3di m-km8=^x9a  p2 3y-24g%* export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:   db.sqlite3  I hope you’re wondering now: how do we set DATABASE_URL in production on Heroku? It turns out that when Heroku provisions a new PostgreSQL database, it automatically creates a  185https:  github.com jacobian dj-database-url   Chapter 16: Deployment  263  configuration variable for it named … DATABASE_URL. Since the .env file is not committed to production, our Django project on Heroku will instead use this PostgreSQL configuration. Pretty elegant, no?  The last step is to install Psycopg186, a database adapter that lets Python apps talk to PostgreSQL databases. Heroku needs it in deployment so we can just install it now.  Command Line   news  $ pipenv install psycopg2-binary==2.8.5  We can use this approach because Django’s ORM  Object Relational Mapper  translates our models.py code from Python into the database backend of choice. This works almost all the time without error. However, it is possible for weird bugs to creep up and it is recommended to install PostgreSQL locally, too, on professional projects however doing so is beyond the scope of this book.  Static Files  Surprisingly, we actually don’t have any static files in our Newspaper app at this point. We’ve relied entirely on hosted Bootstrap rather than own CSS, JavaScript, or images as we did in the Blog app. That is likely to change as the site grows in the future so we may as well set up static files properly now.  Stop the local server with Control+c and create a new static folder in the same directory as manage.py. Then add folders for css, javascript, and images.  186https:  www.psycopg.org docs    Chapter 16: Deployment  264  Command Line  news  $ mkdir static  news  $ mkdir static css  news  $ mkdir static js  news  $ mkdir static images  We’ll also need to install the WhiteNoise187 package since Django does not support serving static files in production itself.  Command Line  news  $ pipenv install whitenoise==5.1.0  WhiteNoise must be added to config settings.py in the following locations:    whitenoise above django.contrib.staticfiles in INSTALLED_APPS   WhiteNoiseMiddleware above CommonMiddleware   STATICFILES_STORAGE configuration pointing to WhiteNoise  Code  config settings.py INSTALLED_APPS = [  ... 'whitenoise.runserver_nostatic',  new 'django.contrib.staticfiles',  ]  ]  MIDDLEWARE = [  'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware', 'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware', 'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',  new ...  STATIC_URL = ' static ' STATICFILES_DIRS = [str BASE_DIR.joinpath 'static'  ]  new STATIC_ROOT = str BASE_DIR.joinpath 'staticfiles'    new STATICFILES_STORAGE =  'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'  new  187http:  whitenoise.evans.io en stable    Chapter 16: Deployment  265  Run the collectstatic command for the first time to compile all the static file directories and files into one self-contained unit suitable for deployment.  Command Line   news  $ python manage.py collectstatic  As a final step, in order for our templates to display any static files, they must be loaded in so add {% load static %} to the top of the base.html file.  Code    {% load static %}   ...  Deployment Checklist  It’s easy to lose track of all the steps required for readying a Django website for production. There’s one more we must do: install Gunicorn as the production web server.  Command Line   news  $ pipenv install gunicorn==19.9.0  And then tell Heroku to use it via a new Procfile file created in the same folder as manage.py.  Command Line   news  $ touch Procfile  Add the following single line to Procfile.   Chapter 16: Deployment  266  Procfile web: gunicorn config.wsgi --log-file -  Here is a recap of what we’ve done so far:    add environment variables via environs[django]   set DEBUG to False   set ALLOWED_HOSTS   use environment variable for SECRET_KEY   update DATABASES to use SQLite locally and PostgreSQL in production   configure static files   install whitenoise for static file hosting   install gunicorn for production web server  These steps apply to Django deployments on any server or platform; they are not Heroku- specific.  Git & GitHub  Amazingly we haven’t used Git in our project yet. In general, initializing Git and regularly committing work should be a regular part of your work flow even though we haven’t done that so far in this project, in part to avoid the extra step of updating the SECRET_KEY value.  Initialize a new Git repository and commit the code changes we’ve made.  Command Line  news  $ git status  news  $ git add -A  news  $ git commit -m "initial commit"  As a best practice, create a repository on GitHub to store the code as well. Create a new GitHub repo188 called news-app. Make sure to select the “Private” radio button and then click on the  188https:  github.com new   Chapter 16: Deployment  267  “Create repository” button. On the next page, scroll down to where it says “â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line.” Copy and paste the two commands there into your terminal.  It should look like the below albeit instead of wsvincent as the username it will be your GitHub username.  Command Line   news  $ git remote add origin https:  github.com wsvincent news-app.git  news  $ git push -u origin master  All set! Now we can configure Heroku and finally see our Newspaper project live.  Make sure that you are already logged into your Heroku account via the command line.  Heroku Deployment  Command Line   news  $ heroku login  The command heroku create makes a new container for our app to live in and by default, Heroku will assign a random name. You can specify a custom name, as we are doing here, but it must be unique on Heroku. Mine is called dfb-news so that name is already taken; you need another combination of letters and numbers!  Command Line   news  $ heroku create dfb-news  Now configure Git so that when you push to Heroku, it goes to your new app name  replacing dfb-news with your custom name .   Chapter 16: Deployment  Command Line   news  $ heroku git:remote -a dfb-news  268  So far so good. A new step at this point is creating a PostgreSQL database on Heroku itself, which we haven’t done before. Heroku has its own hosted PostgreSQL databases we can use which come in multiple tiers. For a learning project like this, the free hobby-dev tier is more than adequate. Run the following command to create this new database:  Command Line   news  $ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev Creating heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev on â¬¢ dfb-news... free Database has been created and is available ! This database is empty. If upgrading, you can transfer ! data from another database with pg:copy Created postgresql-symmetrical-16853 as DATABASE_URL Use heroku addons:docs heroku-postgresql to view documentation  Did you see that Heroku has created a custom DATABASE_URL to access the database? For mine here, it is postgresql-symmetrical-16853. This is automatically available as a configuration variable within Heroku once we deploy. That’s why we don’t need to set an environment variable for DATABASE_URL in production. We also don’t need to set DEBUG to False because that is the default value in our config settings.py file. The only environment variable to manually add to Heroku is SECRET_KEY, so copy its value from your .env file and run the config:set command, placing the value of the SECRET_KEY itself within single quotes ''.  Command Line   news  $ heroku config:set SECRET_KEY='yq@=cjw8z@ssx7_3ukfoi9j3di m-km8=^x9a  p2 3y-24g%*'  Now it’s time to push our code up to Heroku itself and start a web process so our Heroku dyno is running.   Chapter 16: Deployment  269  Command Line  news  $ git push heroku master  news  $ heroku ps:scale web=1  The URL of your new app will be in the command line output or you can run heroku open to find it.  But if you go to this URL now though you’ll see a 500 Server Error message! That’s because the PostgreSQL database exists but has not been setup yet! Previously we used SQLite in production, which is file-based, and was already configured locally and then pushed up to Heroku. But this PostgreSQL database of ours is brand new! Heroku has all our code but we haven’t configured this production database yet.  The same process used locally of running migrate, creating a superuser account, and entering blog posts in the admin must be followed again. To run a command with Heroku, as opposed to locally, prefix it with heroku run.  Command Line  news  $ heroku run python manage.py migrate  news  $ heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser  You will need to log into the live admin site to add newspaper entries and comments since, again, this is a brand-new database and not related to our local SQLite one.  For larger sites, there are techniques such as using fixtures189 to load data into a local database but doing so is beyond our scope here.  Refresh your live website and it should work correctly. Note that since the production server will run constantly in the background, you do not need to use the runserver command on Heroku.  Conclusion  Phew! We just covered a ton of material so it’s likely you feel overwhelmed right now. That’s normal. There are many steps involved to configure a website for proper deployment. The good  189https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 howto initial-data    Chapter 16: Deployment  270  news is that this same list of production settings will hold true for almost every Django project. Don’t worry about memorizing all the steps.  After you’ve built and deployed several Django websites, these steps will soon feel very familiar. And in fact, we’ve only scratched the surface of additional security measures that can be configured. Django comes with its own deployment checklist190 that can be run via the command line to highlight additional security issues.  Command Line   news  $ heroku run python manage.py check --deploy  The other big stumbling block for newcomers is becoming comfortable with the difference between local and production environments. It’s very likely you will forget at some point to push code changes into production and spend minutes or hours wondering why the change isn’t live on your site. Or even worse, you’ll make changes to your local SQLite database and expect them to magically appear in the production PostgreSQL database. It’s part of the learning process. But Django really does make it much smoother than it otherwise would be. And now you know enough to confidently deploy any Django project online.  190https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 3.1 howto deployment checklist    Conclusion  Congratulations on finishing Django for Beginners! After starting from absolute zero we’ve now built five different web applications from scratch and covered all the major features of Django: templates, views, urls, users, models, security, testing, and deployment. You now have the knowledge to go off and build your own modern websites with Django.  As with any new skill, it’s important to practice and apply what you’ve just learned. The CRUD  Create-Read-Update-Delete  functionality in our Blog and Newspaper sites is common in many, many other web applications. For example, can you make a Todo List web application? A Twitter or Facebook clone? You already have all the tools you need. When you’re starting out I believe the best approach is to build as many small projects as possible and incrementally add complexity and research new things.  Django For Professionals  Web development is a very deep field and there’s always something new to learn. This is especially true for large websites that must handle thousands or millions of visitors at a time. Django itself is more than capable of this. If you’d like to learn more, I’ve written a follow-up book called Django for Professionals191. It tackles many of the challenges around building truly production- ready websites such as using Docker, a production database locally like PostgreSQL, handling payments, advanced user registration, security, performance, and much more.  Django for APIs  In practice, most professional Django developers rarely build full-stack websites from scratch. Instead, they work on teams and focus on the back-end creating web APIs that can be consumed  191https:  djangoforprofessionals.com   Conclusion  272  by mobile apps like iOS and Android or websites that use dedicated JavaScript front-end framework such as Vue192, React193, or Angular194.  Thanks to the power of Django REST Framework195, a third-party app that is tightly coupled with Django itself, it is possible to transform any existing Django website into an API with a minimal amount of code. If you’d like to learn more, I’ve written an entire book on the topic, Django for APIs196.  3rd Party Packages  As we’ve seen in this book, 3rd party packages are a vital part of the Django ecosystem especially when it comes to deployment or improvements around user registration. It’s not uncommon for a professional Django website to rely on literally dozens of such packages.  However, a word of caution is in order. Don’t blindly install and use 3rd party packages just because it saves a small amount of time now. Every additional package introduces another dependency, another risk that its maintainer won’t fix every bug or won’t keep up to date with the latest version of Django. Take the time to understand what it is doing.  If you’d like to view more packages, the Django Packages197 website is a comprehensive resource of all available third party apps. Or, if you find that overwhelming, the awesome-django198 repo contains a curated list of the most popular packages, which are worth a closer look.  As you become more comfortable with Django and web development in general, you’ll find the official Django documentation199 and source code200 increasingly valuable. I refer to both on an  Learning Resources  192https:  vuejs.org  193https:  reactjs.org  194https:  angularjs.org  195https:  www.django-rest-framework.org 196https:  djangoforapis.com 197https:  djangopackages.org  198https:  github.com wsvincent awesome-django 199https:  www.djangoproject.com  200https:  github.com django django   Conclusion  273  almost daily basis. There is also the official Django forum201, a great resource albeit underutilized resource for Django-specific questions.  To continue on your Django journey, a good source of additional tutorials and courses is the website LearnDjango.com202, which I maintain. You might also look at the DjangoX203 and DRFX204 starter projects to speed up the development of new projects.  If you’re interested in a weekly podcast on Django, I co-host Django Chat205, which features interviews with leading developers and topic deep-dives. And I co-write a weekly newsletter, Django News206, filled with news, articles, tutorials, and more all about Django.  Django is, ultimately, just Python so if your Python skills could use improvement there are two books in particular I recommend. For beginners and those new to Python, it doesn’t get much better than Eric Matthes’s Python Crash Course207. For intermediate to advanced developers, Fluent Python208, Effective Python209, and Python Tricks210 are worthy of additional study.  Python Books  Feedback  As a final note, I’d love to hear your thoughts about the book. It is a constant work-in-progress and the detailed feedback from readers helps me continue to improve it. I respond to every email and can be reached at will@learndjango.com211.  If you purchased this book on Amazon, please consider leaving an honest review. These reviews make an enormous impact on book sales.  201https:  forum.djangoproject.com  202https:  learndjango.com 203https:  github.com wsvincent djangox 204https:  github.com wsvincent drfx 205https:  djangochat.com 206https:  django-news.com 207http:  amzn.to 2okggMH 208http:  amzn.to 2ovfgsR 209http:  amzn.to 2nCqivT 210http:  amzn.to 2G4A5S8 211mailto:will@learndjango.com   Conclusion  274  Thank you for reading the book and good luck on your journey with Django!
