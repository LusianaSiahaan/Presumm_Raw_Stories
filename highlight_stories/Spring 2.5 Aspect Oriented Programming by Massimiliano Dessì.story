In the  70s, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie created the language C. It was quite similar  to human language, making it easier and faster to write code, while keeping a  high level of abstraction. This allowed the realization of concepts and ideas, which  was not possible for the previous languages as they were forced to focus on the  processor's language. Later, Smalltalk and C++ permitted the shaping of concepts  and ideas through objects‚ providing a new way to structure applications and write  programs. With the object-oriented languages, any system could be created with  increasing complexity in a more manageable way, thanks to the modeling of   entities in the form of types and the collaboration between them. In some cases,  object-oriented programming introduces or causes inefficiencies, and aspect-oriented  programming helps in filling these gaps. The aim of Aspect-Oriented Programming   AOP  is not to replace Object-Oriented Programming  OOP , but to complement it,  allowing you to create clearer and better structured programs. Gregor Kiczales, one  of the founders of AOP, said  an extract from http:  www.cs.ubc.ca ~gregor  papers kiczales-ECOOP1997-AOP.pdf  "We have found many programming  problems for which neither procedural nor object-oriented programming techniques  are sufficient to clearly capture some of the important design decisions the program  must implement. This forces the implementation of those design decisions to be  scattered throughout the code, resulting in tangled code that is excessively difficult  to develop and maintain." Neither aspect-oriented programming nor object-oriented  programming can make up for a bad design: The first assumption is that a software  system is well-designed. There is no solution for a badly designed system, and also  none for a badly implemented system. There is only one good strategy: to change  it. The difference between a good and a bad design is the capacity to evolve and  adapt to new requirements without being twisted. Object-oriented programming,  supported by aspect-oriented programming, helps designers and developers   in this direction.   Preface  What this book covers Chapter 1 introduces the ideas that led to Aspect-Oriented Programming. An  overview of main concepts of AOP is used to describe components and features  provided by Spring AOP, while a set of concise yet   clear examples lets the reader discover what can actually be done with AOP. Chapter 2 describes in detail the fundamentals of AOP in Spring, presenting  interfaces and classes introduced in early 1.x versions of the framework. This   chapter shows how to use AOP programmatically, to let the reader discover the   basis of Spring AOP and the components that implement Aspect-Oriented  Programming in Spring. Chapter 3 explains how the weaving of AOP components is done using the proxy  pattern and  DK or CGLIB implementations. It describes the purpose of proxies  and how to use them effectively. Some practical examples show how to use the  proxies programmatically, with annotations and with XML; they explain the  ProxyFactoryBean and how to make the programmer's work easier with AutoProxy.   The chapter describes also some smart techniques on target sources. Chapter 4 explains how Spring AOP is supported by AspectJ. Configuration activity  is made simpler, more flexible and more powerful, thanks to annotations and  the syntax of Aspect  on pointcuts  without which those costructs would not be  available . All examples show how to use Aspect  with both annotations and XML.  The chapter contains practical recipes for specific cases, such as the injection of  dependencies on domain objects, the management of aspects' priority, the use of  different life cycles for Aspects and how to use Load Time Weaving. The chapter  ends with some strategies on how to choose different AOP approaches to fulfil  specific requirements. Chapter 5 describes the design alternatives that can be implemented using AOP.  These alternatives are solutions for common requirements: concurrency, caching,  and security. Using AOP, they can be achieved in a very elegant and easy way,   being at the same time totally transparent for the system where they are applied. Chapter 6 introduces Domain-Driven Development as a alternative way to   design applications. The prototype example presented in this chapter is a typical  Three-Layer application, where DDD is used for design and AOP is used to inject   the dependencies on domain objects. iBatis is used for persistence to the database.  [ 2 ]   Preface  Chapter 7 completes the prototype application started in Chapter 6, showing the  application layer and the user interface. The latter is implemented with Spring  MVC using annotations. Integration and unit tests are used to verify the correctness  of the classes; DBUnit is used to test persistence classes, while some Mock classes  are used to test the UI. The chapter contains the configurations for the prototype  infrastructure, including autentication and authorization with Spring Security and  the  Unit 4.5 test suite. Chapter 8 describes the development tools needed to include Spring AOP and  AspectJ in the Eclipse IDE. The reader can find here detailed istructions on how to  configure Eclipse with the plug-ins for Spring and for the AspectJ Development Tool,  and how to install the PostgreSQL database and the Apache Tomcat servlet engine.  All installation procedures are described for the three main operating systems:  Ubuntu Linux, Apple Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows XP.

[ 6 ]   Understanding AOP Concepts  This chapter presents an overview of Aspect-Oriented Programming concepts, and  explains their capabilities and features. Here is a brief outline of the topics covered   in this chapter:           Limits of Object-Oriented Programming The AOP solutions Spring AOP components Spring AOP 2.5  In this chapter we will see what the designing and realization process of an  application or software system consists of.   We have to stop and think about the problems that we will see, beginning from the  designing phase: how to structure the application, what are the problems in the  implementation phase if we use only object-oriented programming, and in which  forms they show themselves. We will also see how aspect-oriented programming  can support object-oriented programming to solve problems in the implementation  phase. We will finally see what Spring provides to allow us to use aspect-oriented  programming with Inversion of Control  IoC . If we use a method such as the Extreme Programming, we iteratively focus hard on  the functionalities and improve them following the clients' feedback.  Therefore, who does what is described so that the functionalities that the system  provides to the user are clear.  After having found these entities, we model them as classes that contain data and  have behavior.   To do this, we use some features of the object-oriented languages, such as  inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and interfaces, to create a model   that helps us solve the domain problem in the simplest way possible.   Understanding AOP concepts  Drawing, structuring, and building software systems in this way is now considered  a common practice. Nevertheless, there are some inefficiencies that emerge at the  moment of realizing the project. In fact, however accurately the design may have  been made with highly cohesive classes and low coupling, there are still some  situations where we have to make compromises.  Limits of object-oriented programming The object-oriented paradigm provided the concepts and the right instruments for  the creation of complex programs and had a great impact on the development of  new disciplines in the domain of software design. In this sense, both engineering  and software design disciplines developed greatly. Particularly important has been  the development of the so-called Design Patterns that allow a certain degree of  systemization of the activity of software design and development.  The concept of a class that includes data and functions that change its values  allows for the realization of cohesive and independent entities  high cohesion, low  coupling . This in turn realizes the required business functionalities through the  exchange of messages.  Using design patterns and object-oriented programming, the development of an  application can be realized by dividing the activities into independent groups of  functionalities. In fact, as soon as the interfaces of every entity of the application  have been defined, their implementation can be realized independently by different  groups of developers.  Another advantage is the reliability offered by the object. If we consider that the  access to an object's data and its modification can happen only by means of the  methods that it exposes through its interface, no user can unpredictably corrupt   this data and make that object's state inconsistent.  Finally, the concept of inheritance allows the definition of new classes that extend  the functionality of the classes from which they derive. In this sense, we obtain the  extendibility and the reuse of software.  After the advantages of the new instruments given by the object-oriented  programming paradigm, we have to consider the limits that occurred in   practical application.   The main problem is to manage to control the complexity. To face it, we will have to  choose modularization: "divide et impera", according to the Latin maxim.  [ 8 ]   Chapter 1  If architects look at the previous projects on which they have worked, they will  notice that a common feature is the constant increase in the systems' complexity.   Separating the functionalities that have to be implemented into simpler and  more manageable modules helps to control the complexity. Software systems are  conceptually complex by their very nature, and increasing their complexity in the  implementation means increasing the expense and the probability of its failure.   The code needed to integrate a complex implementation is expensive. The cost  would be even higher if new features are required. In fact, those features imply   deep changes in several parts of the implementation.   If we didn't take the way of modularization and simplification, we would have a  monolithic system that would be unmanageable to modify.  First of all, we have to single out the modules that will implement the core   business that justifies the design and the implementation of the software. Once   we have completely understood how to implement the core business, we can think  about designing the rest of the application so that the core business supports the  system's users.  We are used to take the best practice of dividing the application into logical layers   presentation layer, business layer, and data layer . But, there are some functionalities  that cross these layers transversally. They are named crosscutting concerns. A crosscutting concern is, therefore, an independent entity that transversally crosses  other functionalities of software. Take a look at the following figure:  S e c u r i t y  T r a n s a c t i o n  L o g g n g  i  E x c e p t i o n   H a n d  l i  n g  C a c h n g  i  C o n c u r r e n c y   c o n t r o  l  P e r f o r m a n c e   m o n i t o r i n g  R e s o u r c e   p o o  l i  n g  Presentation Layer  Business Layer  Resource Layer  [ 9 ]   Understanding AOP concepts  The most common crosscutting concerns are: security, logging, transactions  management, caching, performance checking, concurrency control, and   exception management.  These crosscutting concerns, if implemented only with object-oriented programming,  realize a bad matching between the core business and the modules that implement  its functionalities. We are forced to deal with the implementation of these transversal  functionalities into various modules, moreover, adding other transversal modules  or modifying the existing ones. We are also forced to modify the code in which these  modules are used. This is owing to the undesired, but necessary, matching that the  object-oriented implementation unavoidably brings with it.  The followings graphs  extracts from http:  www.parc.com research projects  aspectj downloads SDWest2002-BetterJavaWithAJ.ppt , show the code of  Servlet Engine Tomcat 4 divided in modules:  In the figure above, XML parsing fits in one module.  [ 10 ]   Chapter 1  In the figure above, the URL pattern matching fits in two modules.  In the figure above, logging is scattered in too many modules.  This figure shows the points where Tomcat classes' logging functionalities are called   underlined in red . As we can see, they are scattered in the points of the modules  where the functionality is required.  [ 11 ]   Understanding AOP concepts  The problem of scattering code derived from the crosscutting concerns in  object-oriented programming arises due to its transversality to the crosscutting  concerns, which is implemented in the classes. More correctly, the crosscutting  concerns should be analysed as a third dimension of the design. Whereas in the  implementation there are two dimensions, as shown in the following figure:  Security  Business logic  Concern space  Security  Transaction  Business logic  Transaction  Implementation space  In these situations, aspect-oriented programming provides support to object-oriented  programming for uncoupling modules that implement crosscutting concerns.  Its purpose is the separation of concerns. In object-oriented programming the basic unit is the Class, whereas in   aspect-oriented programming it's the Aspect. The aspect contains the implementation of a crosscutting concern, which in the   class should coexist with the objects that collaborate with it, for each class that   needs it.  In this way, we can write the object-oriented classes without involving the  crosscutting concerns in the implementation.  So, classes can freely evolve without taking into account this dependency.   The functionalities provided by the crosscutting concerns in the aspects will be  applied to the objects through an aspect weaver or through some proxy classes.   We will deal with this in the later chapters.  Now we will see how the problems we exposed, arise in the code.   [ 12 ]   Chapter 1  Code scattering Code scattering appears when the functionality is scattered because it's implemented  in several modules.  There are two sorts of code scattering:  Blocks of duplicated code  that is, the same code appears in   different modules   Blocks of complementary code, and different modules implementing  complementary parts of the concern  for example, in Access Control, one  module performs authentication and a second performs authorization    Let's see the following code to illustrate the cases in which the code is duplicated in  different modules:  The Info interface is implemented in the same way by two different classes,  ScatteringA and ScatteringB. Therefore, this is a useless duplication of code.  public interface Info {  public String getName  ; public Date getCreationDate  ;  public class ScatteringA implements Info{  public ScatteringA String name, String author {       }  creation = new Date  ; this.name = name; this.autor = author;  public ScatteringA Date creation, String name, String author {       }  this.creation = creation; this.name = name; this.autor = author;  public Date getCreationDate   {   }  return  Date creation.clone  ;  public String getName   {   }  return name;  [ 13 ]            }                                                    }                                                   }  Understanding AOP concepts  public String getAutor   {   }  return autor;  private Date creation; private String name; private String autor;  public class ScatteringB implements Info{  public ScatteringB String name, String address {       }  creation = new Date  ; this.name = name; this.address = address;  public ScatteringB Date creation, String name, String address {       }  this.creation = creation; this.name = name; this.address = address;  public Date getCreationDate   {   }  return  Date creation.clone  ;  public String getName   {   }  return name;  public String getAddress   {   }  return address;  private Date creation; private String name; private String address;  Code tangling Code tangling occurs when a module has to manage several concerns at the same  time such as logging, exception handling, security, caching, and more or when a  module has elements of the implementation of other concerns inside.  [ 14 ]   In order to show what we mean by code tangling, let's look at the following code:  public class TanglingListUserController extends MultiActionController{  public ModelAndView list HttpServletRequest req,    HttpServletResponse res  throws Exception {     Chapter 1    logging log req ;     authorization if req.isUserInRole "admin"  {  String username = req.getRemoteUser  ;  List users ;                   conf.getValue "numberOfUsers"  , username ;    exception handling try {                 cache with authorization users = cache.get Integer.valueOf         users ;       }else{  } catch  Exception e  {   }  users = usersManager.getUsers  ;  return new ModelAndView "usersTemplate", "users",   return new ModelAndView "notAllowed" ;                    }  private void log HttpServletRequest req  {           }  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder "remoteAddress:" ; sb.append req.getRemoteAddr   ; sb.append "username:" ; sb.append req.getRemoteUser   ; log.fine sb.toString   ;                                                      }                             }  …  In this Spring MultiActionController, we can see how many features are  managed: logging, authorisation, exception management, and caching.  [ 15 ]   Understanding AOP concepts  In spite of dealing with just the presentation of a list of users, this controller has  to do many things, and the consequence is that other concerns are heavier in its  implementation. That is code tangling.  The AOP solution We have seen that with an object-oriented system, code tangling and code scattering  can occur. This can cause the system to have duplicate code and functionalities  not being clear and plain. Evident problems with the implementation of further  requirements arise, with modules strongly coupled in the implementation.   In the previous situations, the object-oriented system can't be of any help because the  following effects occur:                        Difficult evolution: A module's implementation is coupled to   other functionalities. Poor quality: In the TanglingListUserController example, if a problem  arises, it's not even clear what  the module's main functionality is. Code not reusable: If the implementation involves several concerns, it won't  be suitable for other scenarios.  Productivity: Scattered implementations move the problem's main focus to  the periphery where the implementations are.  Traceability: Code scattering functionality is implemented at several   points. To have a hold on it, you need to check all the modules in which   the implementation is spread.  Aspect-oriented programming allows:  The modularization of crosscutting concerns by its constructs  The uncoupling of the modules Using aspects, the removal of dependence of a crosscutting concern from the  modules that use it  Now let's see practically what AOP provides to overcome the gaps in object-oriented  programming highlighted so far in the book, and what are its main concepts.   Let's see who are the main actors that enable the aspect-oriented programming,  implement the crosscutting concerns in the aspects, and define with other actors   the points and the classes on which these crosscutting concerns are applied.  [ 16 ]   In the following figure, we see the normal interactions between objects:  Chapter 1  method  method  method  method  Object B  method  Object A  method  method  Object C  In object-oriented programming, classes cooperate by calling mutually public  methods and exchanging messages.   Crosscutting concerns are placed in the implementations of the classes A, B, and  C, and this leads to the problems previously explained such as code tangling, code  scattering, and so on.  The following figure conceptually compares the execution flow of the invocation of a  method in the case of OOP and AOP:   Object A  method  method  Object B  Object-Oriented Programming  Aspect-Oriented Programming  joinpoint =method invocation  poincut = methodB  advice  Aspect  Target Object = Object B  [ 17 ]   Understanding AOP concepts  In the case of object-oriented programming, where the crosscutting concerns are  included into the classes' implementations, Object A in its method A invokes method  B on Object B. This is, apart from exceptions, the normal flow of messages' exchange  between two objects that interact. The cross interactions are called back and used just  in these two methods because there isn't any other way to act.  In the flow with aspect-oriented programming, the crosscutting functionalities are  extracted from the object-oriented implementations and applied as advices where  they are actually useful. This is because they are applied on the flow where they  really have to be carried out, that is by the pointcuts and on the target object.   The whole of the advice, the pointcut, the target object, and the joinpoint, make   an aspect.  Now let's introduce the AOP terms denoting the components that take part in the  implementation, which are partially pictured in the previous figure.                       Aspect: Corresponds to the class in object-oriented programming. It's the  crosscutting functionality. Joinpoint: This is the application point of the aspect. It is a point of the  execution of a program such as the invocation of a constructor or the  execution of a method or the management of an exception  WHEN . Advice: This is the action an aspect performs at a certain joinpoint. Advices can be "around", "before", and "after". Pointcut: This is the expression for the joinpoint's selection, for instance a  method's execution with a certain signature  WHERE . Introduction: This is the declaration of methods or additional fields on the  object to which the aspect will be applied. It allows the introduction of new  interfaces and implementations on the objects. Target object: This is the module  Object  to which the aspect will be applied. Weaving: This is the linking action between the aspect and the objects to  which advices must be applied. This action may be performed at the editing phase using an Aspect  compiler,  or at runtime. If a runtime action is carried out, an AOP Proxy is used to implement the  contracts that the aspect has to respect.  [ 18 ]   Chapter 1  Types of advice:                 Before advice: This is an advice that executes before a joinpoint, but   which does not have the ability to prevent execution flow proceeding   to the joinpoint. After returning advice: An advice to be executed after a joinpoint   completes normally.  Throws advice: This is an advice to be executed if a method exits by  throwing an exception. After  finally  advice: This advice is to be executed regardless of the means  by which a joinpoint exits. Around advice: This advice can perform custom behavior before and after  the method invocation. It is also responsible for choosing whether to proceed  to the joinpoint, or to cut short the advised method execution by returning its  own return value or throwing an exception.  In the case of Aspect-Oriented Programming in the earlier image, taking into account  that the joinpoint is the invocation of methods and that the joinpoint is the method  called methodB, the aspect executes the crosscutting concern included into the  advice when methodB is invoked on the target, Object B. This kind of interception  before methodB is that of a Before Advice.  What Spring provides in terms of AOP The main aim of Spring AOP is to allow the realization of  EE functionalities in the  simplest manner and without being intrusive. With this aim, it allows the use of a  subset of AOP functionalities in a simple and intuitive way  introduced since   version 1.x, and in version 2.x with new integrations with Aspect  .  In order to achieve this aim, since version 1.x, Spring has implemented the  specifications of the AOP alliance. This is a joint effort between representatives  of many open-source AOP projects, including Rod Johnson of Spring, to define a  standard set of interfaces for AOP implementations.  In Spring AOP, an aspect is represented by an instance of a class that implements the  Advisor interface. There are two subinterfaces of Advisor: IntroductionAdvisor  and PointcutAdvisor. The PointcutAdvisor interface is implemented by all  Advisors that use pointcuts to control the applicability of advice to joinpoints.  In Spring, introductions are treated as special kinds of advice. Using the  IntroductionAdvisor interface, you can control those classes to which an  introduction applies.   [ 19 ]   Understanding AOP concepts  The core of Spring AOP is based around proxies. There are two ways of using  proxies: programmatic modality and declarative modality.  The former consists of using a ProxyFactory to create a proxy of the class on which  you want to apply an aspect. After creating the proxy, you use the ProxyFactory to  weave all the aspects you want to use on the object.  The ProxyFactory class controls the weaving and proxy creation process in Spring.  Using the ProxyFactory class, you control which aspects you want to weave into the  proxy. You can weave only an aspect, that is, advice combined with a pointcut.   However, in some cases you want an advice to apply to the invocation of all methods  in a class, not just a selection. For this reason, the ProxyFactory class provides  the addAdvice   method. Internally, addAdvice   wraps the advice you pass it  in an instance of DefaultPointcutAdvisor, and configures it with a pointcut that  includes all methods by default.  Programmatic way This is an example of class that implements the MethodBeforeAdvice to perform a  crosscutting functionality before the method of the target class.  Before advice Before advice is performed before the invocation of the method.  Let us see an example that shows the usage of before advice, with a class that  implements the MethodBeforeAdvice, and has a main method for testing.  package org.springaop.chapter.one; import java.lang.reflect.Method;  import org.springaop.target.Hello; import org.springframework.aop.MethodBeforeAdvice; import org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactory;  public class BeforeAdvice implements MethodBeforeAdvice{  public static void main String[] args  {                           target class Hello target = new Hello  ;     create the proxy ProxyFactory pf = new ProxyFactory  ;  [ 20 ]   Chapter 1     add advice pf.addAdvice new BeforeAdvice   ;     setTarget pf.setTarget target ;  Hello proxy =  Hello  pf.getProxy  ; proxy.greeting  ;  public void before Method method, Object[] args, Object target     throws Throwable {     System.out.println "Good morning" ;  public class Hello {  public void greeting  {   }  System.out.println "reader" ;  The result will be:                }    }                            }        }  After returning advice After returning advice is performed after the invocation of the method.  package org.springaop.chapter.one;  import java.lang.reflect.Method;  import org.springaop.target.Hello; import org.springframework.aop.AfterReturningAdvice; import org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactory;  public class AfterRetuningAdvice implements AfterReturningAdvice {     public static void main String[] args  {  [ 21 ]   Understanding AOP concepts     target class Hello target = new Hello  ;     create the proxy ProxyFactory pf = new ProxyFactory  ;     add advice pf.addAdvice new AfterRetuningAdvice   ;     setTarget pf.setTarget target ;  Hello proxy =  Hello  pf.getProxy  ; proxy.greeting  ;  public void afterReturning Object returnValue, Method method,   Object[] args, Object target  throws Throwable {     System.out.println ",this is a afterReturningAdvice        message" ;    }  public class Hello {  public void greeting  {   }  System.out.println "reader" ;  The result will be:                          }                                  }        }  [ 22 ]   Around advice This is the Hello target class on which we want to apply an around advice. It is  called before the method and controls its invocation.  Chapter 1  public class Hello {  public void greeting  {   }  System.out.println "reader" ;        }  This is the advice that must be applied around the performed method; as we can see  that the invocation of the method occurs with invocation.proceed.  package org.springaop.chapter.one;  import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInterceptor; import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInvocation;  public class MethodDecorator implements MethodInterceptor{  public Object invoke MethodInvocation invocation  throws Throwable      System.out.print "Hello " ;    {           Object retVal = invocation.proceed  ;         System.out.println "this is aop !" ;         return retVal;   }  }  This is the class where, through the ProxyFactory, we give the advice to apply. But,  in the case of the MethodDecorator, it is an around advice.  package org.springaop.chapter.one;   import org.springaop.target.Hello; import org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactory;  public class AroundAdvice {  public static void main String[] args  {                                 target class Hello target = new Hello  ;     create the proxy ProxyFactory pf = new ProxyFactory  ;     add advice  [ 23 ]   pf.addAdvice new MethodDecorator   ;     setTarget pf.setTarget target ;  Hello proxy =  Hello  pf.getProxy  ; proxy.greeting  ;  Understanding AOP concepts              }                }  The result will be:  After throwing advice This advice is performed only if the method on which the advice is applied throws  an exception.  This is a class that intentionally throws an exception in every method; the exceptions  are of different types.  package org.springaop.target;  public class ExceptionTarget {  public void errorMethod   throws Exception {            throw new Exception "Fake exception" ;     }      public void otherErrorMethod   throws IllegalArgumentException {         throw new NullPointerException "Other Fake exception" ;     }  }  This is the code to try it:  package org.springaop.chapter.one;  import java.lang.reflect.Method;  import org.springaop.target.ExceptionTarget; import org.springframework.aop.ThrowsAdvice;  [ 24 ]   import org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactory;  public class ThrowsAdviceClass implements ThrowsAdvice {  public static void main String[] args  {    target class ExceptionTarget errorBean = new ExceptionTarget  ;  Chapter 1  ExceptionTarget proxy =  ExceptionTarget  pf.getProxy  ;     create the proxy ProxyFactory pf = new ProxyFactory  ;     add advice pf.addAdvice new ThrowsAdviceClass   ;     setTarget pf.setTarget errorBean ;  try {   } catch  Exception ignored  {  proxy.errorMethod  ;  try {   } catch  Exception ignored  {  proxy.otherErrorMethod  ;  public void afterThrowing Exception ex  throws Throwable {      System.out.println "+++" ; System.out.println "Exception Capture:"+ex.getClass  .  System.out.println "+++\n" ;       public void afterThrowing Method method, Object[] args,   System.out.println "+++" ; System.out.println "NullPointerException Capture: "+ex.    Object target, NullPointerException ex  throws Throwable {     getClass  .getName   ;        System.out.println "Method: " + method.getName   ; System.out.println "+++\n" ;      }  [ 25 ]                                              }                                                    }  }  }        getName   ;        }   Understanding AOP concepts  The result will be:  The old Spring XML way Here we will see how to use the examples described previously, configuring the  classes as Spring beans declared in XML file and using a ProxyFactoryBean.  <bean id="helloMatch" class="org.springframework.aop.framework.       ProxyFactoryBean">                                                                            <bean id="helloBeforeAdvice" class="org.springaop.advice.    BeforeAdvice" >  <bean id="helloAfterRetuningAdvice" class="org.springaop.advice.    AfterRetuningAdvice" >  In the configuration of the example, we can see how a helloMatch is defined,  which is in fact a ProxyFactoryBean that puts together the target object on which  the crosscutting concern has to be applied, and the list of advice that contains  the crosscutting functionalities. In this case, two of the advices are used in the  programmatic modality and are applied at the target object as a reference in the   list of interceptors that can be applied on the object.  It is an implementation of Spring FactoryBean that allows you to specify a bean to  target and provides a set of advice and advisors for that bean that are eventually  merged into an AOP proxy. Because you can use both advisor and advice with the  ProxyFactoryBean, you can configure not only the advice declaratively, but the  pointcuts as well.  [ 26 ]   Chapter 1  In both modalities Spring uses internally two sorts of proxy:  DK proxy or   CGLIB proxy.  The concept of an Advisor principally concerns Spring 1.x. We will see later how it  can benefit by the syntax of the pointcuts of AspectJ.  From the 2.x version onwards, there is a closer integration or configuration based  on Aspect  and its syntax, either through annotations or through schema-based  configuration. In any case, it's always possible to use AOP in the classic way as in   the 1.x version.  Spring is first of all an IoC Container, and so it allows using the components that  implement the AOP as a simple bean, assembling them and obtaining the result of  the AOP weaver through Proxy classes, as we previously described.  Instead, Aspect  provides a static implementation of AOP that is produced  at compile time. Spring provides a dynamic implementation of AOP, as it is  implemented through the creation and the use of proxy classes that permit the  implementation of a chain of interceptors.  Obviously, a static implementation provides better performance, but requires greater  knowledge and a compiler, whereas the dynamic implementation is easier to use and  more accessible. It can be disabled from configuration and never requires anything  different from the usual  ava compiler.  Spring permits only method execution to be used as a joinpoint. So we can't use with  Spring AOP all the features of AOP, but we can do so with Aspect  called by Spring.  For example, we must use the support of Aspect  if we want to use as a joinpoint:               The invocations of constructors  Access to the domains of objects with the setter and getter  The initialization of an object  The initialization of an object with a calling  super   The execution inside a class with this    The calling of a method  Therefore, the aspect can be normal  ava classes with the annotation @Aspect, or  configured using configuration XML.  The advices are seen as interceptors that maintain a chain of interceptors around   the joinpoint.  [ 27 ]   Understanding AOP concepts  Pointcuts are performed according to the matching of the Aspect  pointcut  expression language, or according to regular expressions following the rules   present since Spring 1.x.  This introduction clearly shows that Spring has a simplified pattern of the whole set  of AOP features so that AOP can be used with no special editing and alterations to  the bytecode. This would be necessary together with the use of Aspect , if we wanted  all the features of AOP as we will see in the rest of this book.  AOP with IoC in Spring 2.5 Now we will see what Spring 2.5 offers compared to the 1.x version.  AspectJ annotations Now let's see some introductory examples of using the syntax of Aspect  with  annotations; the purpose is to have the same sorts of advice that we saw in the  programmatic examples.  <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans"  xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"   xmlns:aop="http:  www.springframework.org schema aop"  xmlns:p="http:  www.springframework.org schema p"  xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans   http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd  http:  www.springframework.org schema aop   http:  www.springframework.org schema aop spring-aop-2.5.xsd">               ...         In the configuration, if we use a tag  , Spring prepares  autoproxy for the classic mode that uses AspectJ annotations and we define two  beans to check the annotations' behavior.  This is the body of the Target Class that we will use in the examples.  public class Hello {            public void greeting  {   }  System.out.println label ;  private String label = "reader";  [ 28 ]   Chapter 1        }                    public void setLabel String label  {   }  this.label = label;  Before advice  Now we see how to use before advice with the annotations.  package org.springaop.chapter.one.annotation.before;   import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;  import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;   @Aspect  public class BeforeAspect {       @Before "execution * greeting ..

The AOP concepts and terms have been introduced, showing conceptually how and  where they act, which of them Spring supports, and how it does so.  These concepts have then been used in short and simple introductory practical  examples in order to show Spring AOP functionalities both in a programmatic   and declarative manner in version 1.x, and in version 2.5, with annotations and   in a declarative manner with schema-based configuration.  In the next chapters we will look into these topics in detail.  [ 40 ]   Spring AOP Components  This chapter gives an overview of Spring AOP and its components.   A brief outline of the topics covered in this chapter is as follows:         Spring AOP foundations Spring AOP components Spring AOP classic XML configuration, inherited from 1.x versions  Aspect An Aspect represents the functional unit of aspect-oriented programming.  From version 1.x, an aspect was realized as a class that implemented the advisor  interface. An advisor is a class that combines advice and pointcuts, as we will see   in Chapter 3.  Since version 2.x, with the annotations of Aspect , an aspect is a  ava class with the   @Aspect annotation.  Pointcut  A pointcut is an expression for the selection of joinpoints. It can be a collection of  joinpoints used to define an advice that has to be executed. By defining pointcuts   you can have control of the objects composing the application, at the points where  the advices are applied.  As Spring defines method invocation joinpoints, all the methods that can be invoked  on a class will be joinpoints.   Spring AOP Components  These are some examples of pointcuts:  Methods starting with a certain prefix  such as, getter and setter  Methods with a particular package  such as org.springaop.domain.*  Methods that return a certain kind of output  such as public MyClass  get* ...   Any combination of the previous three examples   Pointcut and its components A pointcut is the composition of a ClassFilter and a MethodMatcher. A  ClassFilter narrows the matching of a pointcut or introduction to a given set of  target classes, while a  MethodMatcher checks whether the target method is eligible  for advice.  public interface Pointcut {      public ClassFilter getClassFilter   ;      public MethodMatcher getMethodMatcher  ; }  The getClassFilter method is called first, to check if it can be applied to the   class used.   The ClassFilter interface that filters the classes is composed in this way:  public interface ClassFilter {      public boolean matches Class clazz ;      public static final ClassFilter TRUE = TrueClassFilter.INSTANCE;  Using the constant ClassFilter TRUE, we obtain a match for all classes.  In its implementation, it will return a Boolean value according to whether or not the  input parameter belongs to the wanted type.  Then, the getMethodMatcher method of the Pointcut interface is called. The  MethodMatcher interface is composed in this way:  public interface MethodMatcher {      boolean matches Method m, Class targetClass ;      boolean isRuntime  ;      boolean matches Method m, Class targetClass, Object[] args ;                                          }                          }  [ 42 ]   Chapter 2  The first method that's called is isRuntime  . It tells Spring whether the  MethodMatcher is static or dynamic:   1   2   If the result is false, it's a static MethodMatcher and Spring calls the method  matches Method, Class  once for every method on the target class, caching  the return value for subsequent invocations. If the result is true, it's a dynamic MethodMatcher. Spring does a static   check calling matches Method m, Class targetClass  the first time  to check the applicability. If the result is true, for every invocation the  matches Method m, Class targetClass, Object[] args  is called.  In this way, the checkup is done only the first time, and the subsequent times  the cached value is recovered. From this, we understand that unless we need the  flexibility of having a dynamic MethodMatcher, it's better to use the static one.  Spring provides pointcuts that are ready to use, so normally, there's no need to  implement your pointcut. Pointcuts that are ready to use provided by Spring are:  1.  NameMatchMethodPointcut 2.  RegexpMethodPointcut 3.  StaticMethodMatcherPointcut 4.  DynamicMethodMatcherPointcut  NameMatchMethodPointcut Using the NameMatchMethodPointcut method, you can create a pointcut that  performs simple matching against a list of method names. This class is used for   the programmatic creation of proxies, and for configurations in the Spring factory   with Setter Injection.   The full qualified name of the NameMAtchMethodPointcut class is:  org.springframework.aop.support.NameMatchMethodPointcut   The following methods are available:  1.  NameMatchMethodPointcut addMethodName String methodName    2.  void setMappedName String methodName  3.  void setMappedNames String methodName   [ 43 ]   Spring AOP Components  The two setter methods are used for Setter Injection. The addMethodName method  is used for the addition in a simple way of the names of the necessary methods. To  allow calling addMethodName several times to add all the required method names,  this is returned.  Pointcut pc = new NameMatchMethodPointcut  .addMethodName "setStartDate" .addMethodName  "setEndDate" ;  Let us see an example that explains the usage of NameMatchMethodPointcut.  The target class on which the advice is applied is shown as follows:  package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  public class NameMethodTargetExample {      public void printName  {        }  System.out.println "Max" ;      public void printAction  {      System.out.println "runs" ;    }  public void printSpot  {   }  System.out.println "in Poetto beach" ;        }  The advice that contains the logic to be executed:  package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInterceptor; import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInvocation;  public class AdviceExample implements MethodInterceptor {      public Object invoke MethodInvocation invocation  throws Throwable  {          System.out.println "Invoking " + invocation.getMethod  . getName   ;         Object retVal = invocation.proceed  ;         System.out.println "Job Done" ;         return retVal;     } }  [ 44 ]   The test class:  Chapter 2  public static void main String[] args  {  package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut; import org.springframework.aop.Advisor; import org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactory; import org.springframework.aop.support.DefaultPointcutAdvisor; import org.springframework.aop.support.NameMatchMethodPointcut; public class NameMethodMatcherExample {           NameMethodTargetExample target = new  NameMethodTargetExample  ;         NameMatchMethodPointcut pc = new NameMatchMethodPointcut  ;         pc.addMethodName "printSpot" ;         pc.addMethodName "printAction" ;         Advisor advisor = new DefaultPointcutAdvisor pc, new  AdviceExample   ;         ProxyFactory pf = new ProxyFactory  ;         pf.setTarget target ;         pf.addAdvisor advisor ;         NameMethodTargetExample proxy =  NameMethodTargetExample pf. getProxy  ;          proxy.printName  ;         proxy.printAction  ;         proxy.printSpot  ;     } }  The result will be:  Let's try to see what happened. We defined a target class, an around advice that prints,  before the invocation, the name of the invoked method. Subsequently, the method  invokes on the target class, and after the invocation it prints Job Done. To test NameMethodMatcher, we'll write the NameMethodMatcherExample class   with a main method, then add to NameMatchMethodPointcut only two of the   three methods that could be matched by the pointcut.  [ 45 ]   Spring AOP Components  Then we'll create an advisor that binds pointcut and advice, create a new  ProxyFactory to which we will set advisor and target object, and then   invoke methods.  The result is that only the two added methods  printAction   and printSpot      are intercepted by the pointcut, whereas printName   is not intercepted.  RegexpMethodPointcut To allow pointcuts in a more generic modality than the mere declaration of names,  it's possible to use regular expressions.  For this purpose in Spring 1.x,  akarta ORO  Perl5 regexp  is being used. If we   want to use  DK 1.3; otherwise, we can use the regular expression provided by   java.util.regex if running on  DK 1.4  The full qualified name is:  org.springframework.aop.support.JdkRegexpMethodPointcut   The JdkRexepMethodPointcut allows you to define pointcuts using JDK 1.4 regular  expression support.   org.springframework.aop.support.Perl5RegexpMethodPointcut  The Perl5RegexpMethodPointcut allows you to define pointcuts using Perl 5  regular expression syntax.  For their configuration, we use a single pattern or a list of patterns:  1  patterns: Array of regular expressions for methods that the pointcut    2  pattern: Convenient String property when you have just a single pattern   will match  and don't need an array  In Spring 2.5, we have only the JdkRegexpMethodPointcut, for  DK 1.4 or higher.  <bean id="settersAndHumorousPointcut"     class="org.springframework.aop.support.JdkRegexpMethodPointcut">                                          .*get.*                       .*humorous                         [ 46 ]   Chapter 2  If we use Spring 2.5 or 3.x and a  DK previous to 1.4,  akarta ORO is used in the  background, configuring an advisor in this way:  <bean id="settersAndHumorousAdvisor"  class="org.springframework.aop.support.  RegexpMethodPointcutAdvisor">                 .*set.*   .*humorous           An example of RegexpMethodPointcut use follows:  The target class on which to apply the advice:  package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  public class RegExpTargetExample {      public void printName  {        }  System.out.println "Max" ;      public void printAction  {        }  System.out.println "swims" ;  public void printSpot  {   }  System.out.println "in Poetto beach" ;        }  The advice that contains the logic to be executed:   package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInterceptor; import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInvocation;  public class AdviceExample implements MethodInterceptor {      public Object invoke MethodInvocation invocation  throws Throwable  {  [ 47 ]   Spring AOP Components          System.out.println "Invoking " + invocation.getMethod  . getName   ;         Object retVal = invocation.proceed  ;         System.out.println "Job Done" ;         return retVal;     } }  The test class:  package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  import org.springframework.aop.Advisor; import org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactory; import org.springframework.aop.support.DefaultPointcutAdvisor; import org.springframework.aop.support.JdkRegexpMethodPointcut;  public class RegExpMethodMatcherExample {     public static void main String[] args  {          RegExpTargetExample target = new RegExpTargetExample  ;          JdkRegexpMethodPointcut pc = new JdkRegexpMethodPointcut  ;         String[] patterns = {".*Spot.*",".*Action.*"};         pc.setPatterns patterns ; pc.setPatterns patterns ;         Advisor advisor = new DefaultPointcutAdvisor pc, new  AdviceExample   ;          ProxyFactory pf = new ProxyFactory  ;         pf.setTarget target ;         pf.addAdvisor advisor ;         RegExpTargetExample proxy =  RegExpTargetExample pf. getProxy  ;          proxy.printName  ;         proxy.printAction  ;         proxy.printSpot  ;     }  }  [ 48 ]   The result will be:  Chapter 2  Let's see what we have done. We defined a target class and an around advice that  prints, before the invocation, the name of the invoked method. Subsequently, the  method invokes on the target class, and after the invocation it prints Job Done. To  test JdkRegexpMethodPointcut we wrote the RegExpMethodMatcherExample class  with a main method. We set a string array with the patterns of regular expressions   to JdkRegexpMethodPointcut.  We created an advisor that bound pointcut and advice, created a new ProxyFactory  to which we set the advisor and target object. Then, we invoked methods.  The result was that only methods that contain the regular expressions in their name  were intercepted by the pointcut.  StaticMethodMatcherPointcut The StaticMethodMatcherPointcut abstract class is intended as a base for building  static pointcuts.  The full qualified name of the class is:  org.springframework.aop.StaticMethodMatcherPointcut   We can use it as an anonymous inner class implementing the body of the   method matches:  public static Pointcut exampleStaticPointcut = new  StaticMethodMatcherPointcut   {    public boolean matches Method m, Class targetClass  {              implement custom check   } };  [ 49 ]   Spring AOP Components  Or extending it and implementing its methods:  public class StaticPointcutFooExample extends  StaticMethodMatcherPointcut {      public boolean matches Method method, Class clazz  {         return  "example".equals method.getName    ;     }      public ClassFilter getClassFilter   {         return new ClassFilter   {             public boolean matches Class clazz  {                 return  clazz == MyTarget.class ;             }         };     } }  This is an of example class to which apply advices:  package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  public class PointcutTargetExample {  public void printName  {   }  System.out.println "Max" ;  public void printSpot  {   }  System.out.println "in Poetto beach" ;  This is a second class of example to which apply advices:  package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  public class PointcutTargetExampleTwo {  public void printAction  {   }  System.out.println "swim" ;  public void printSpot   {   }  System.out.println "on Mediterranean Sea" ;               }               }  [ 50 ]   Chapter 2  This is the StaticPointcutMatcher method. It represents the class in which we set  out the matching rules on the type of class and on the method.  package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  import java.lang.reflect.Method; import org.springframework.aop.ClassFilter; import org.springframework.aop.support.StaticMethodMatcherPointcut;  public class StaticPointcutMatcher extends StaticMethodMatcherPointcut  {    public boolean matches Method method, Class cls  {         return  "printSpot".equals method.getName    ;     }      public ClassFilter getClassFilter   {         return new ClassFilter   {             public boolean matches Class cls  {                 return  cls == PointcutTargetExample.class ;             }         };      }                        }  This is the advice. It represents the advice applied according to the  StaticMethodMatcher.  package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInterceptor; import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInvocation;  public class AdviceExample implements MethodInterceptor {      public Object invoke MethodInvocation invocation  throws Throwable  {          System.out.println "Invoking " + invocation.getMethod  . getName   ;         Object retVal = invocation.proceed  ;         System.out.println "Job Done" ;         return retVal;     } }  [ 51 ]   Spring AOP Components  This is the test class:  package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  import org.aopalliance.aop.Advice;  import org.springframework.aop.Advisor; import org.springframework.aop.Pointcut; import org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactory; import org.springframework.aop.support.DefaultPointcutAdvisor;  public class StaticPointcutExample {      public static void main String[] args  {          PointcutTargetExample one = new PointcutTargetExample  ;         PointcutTargetExampleTwo two = new       PointcutTargetExampleTwo  ;          PointcutTargetExample proxyOne;         PointcutTargetExampleTwo proxyTwo;         Pointcut pc = new StaticPointcutMatcher  ;         Advice advice = new AdviceExample  ;         Advisor advisor = new DefaultPointcutAdvisor pc, advice ;          ProxyFactory pf = new ProxyFactory  ;         pf.addAdvisor advisor ;         pf.setTarget one ;         proxyOne =  PointcutTargetExample pf.getProxy  ;          pf = new ProxyFactory  ;         pf.addAdvisor advisor ;         pf.setTarget two ;         proxyTwo =  PointcutTargetExampleTwo pf.getProxy  ;          proxyOne.printName  ;         proxyTwo.printAction  ;          proxyOne.printSpot  ;         proxyTwo.printSpot  ;     }  The result will be:                                          }  [ 52 ]   Chapter 2  Let's try to see what has been done. We defined two target classes,  PointcutTargetExample and PointcutTargetExampleTwo  they print some text ,  and a StaticPointcutMatcher, which is an around advice that prints, before the  invocation, the name of the invoked method. Subsequently, the method invokes on  the target class, and after the invocation it prints Job Done.  To test StaticPointcutMatcher, we wrote the StaticPointcutExample class with  a main method.  Then we create an advisor that bound pointcut and advice, and created a   new ProxyFactory to which we set advisor and target objects. Then, we   invoked methods.  The result was that only the methods of the class that satisfied  StaticPointcutMatcher were intercepted.  DynamicMethodMatcherPointcut DynamicMethodMatcherPointcut is intended as a base class to build   dynamic pointcuts.  The full qualified name is:  org.springframework.aop.support .DynamicMethodMatcherPointcut   The utilization is not so different from that of StaticMethodMatcherPointcut as the  anonymous inner class:  public static Pointcut DynamicPointcutExample = new  DynamicMethodMatcherPointcut   {    public boolean matches Method m, Class targetClass  {                implement custom check   }    public boolean matches Method m, Class targetClass, Object[] args  {                implement custom check   }  }  As explained at the beginning of this chapter, the method matches with two  arguments. It is called like staticMethodMatcher, and if it returns true, the   matches are recalled at every invocation with three arguments.   [ 53 ]   Spring AOP Components  Here is an example of its use:  This is the class to which advices are applied:  package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  public class DynamicPointcutTargetExample {        public void setSpot String spot {   }  this.spot = spot;  public void printSpot  {   }  System.out.println spot ;  private String spot;           }  }  As DynamicMethodMatcher, we use a class that executes the static match   matches Method method, Class cls   on the SetSpot method, and the dynamic  one  matches Method method, Class cls, Object[] args   on parameters ending  with "Ocean".  package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  import org.springframework.aop.ClassFilter; import org.springframework.aop.support.DynamicMethodMatcherPointcut;  public class DynamicMethodMatcher extends DynamicMethodMatcherPointcut  {      public boolean matches Method method, Class cls  {         System.out.println "Static check for " + method.getName   ;         return  "setSpot".equals method.getName    ;     }      public boolean matches Method method, Class cls, Object[] args  {         System.out.println "Dynamic check for " + method.getName   ;         String spot  =   String  args[0] ;         return spot.endsWith "Ocean" ;     }      public ClassFilter getClassFilter   {         return new ClassFilter   {              public boolean matches Class cls  {                 return  cls == DynamicPointcutTargetExample.class ;             }         };     }  [ 54 ]   Chapter 2  As advice we use the same class used in the StaticMethodMatcher's example:  package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInterceptor; import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInvocation;  public class AdviceExample implements MethodInterceptor {      public Object invoke MethodInvocation invocation  throws Throwable  {         System.out.println "Invoking " + invocation.getMethod  . getName   ;         Object retVal = invocation.proceed  ;         System.out.println "Job Done" ;         return retVal;     } }  This is the test class:   package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  import org.springframework.aop.Advisor; import org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactory; import org.springframework.aop.support.DefaultPointcutAdvisor;  public class DynamicPointcutExample {   public static void main String[] args  {         DynamicPointcutTargetExample target = new       DynamicPointcutTargetExample  ;               Advisor advisor = new DefaultPointcutAdvisor                  new DynamicMethodMatcher  , new AdviceExample   ;          ProxyFactory pf = new ProxyFactory  ;         pf.setTarget target ;         pf.addAdvisor advisor ;         DyinamicPointcutTargetExample proxy =             DynamicPointcutTargetExample pf.getProxy  ;          proxy.setSpot "Pacific Ocean" ;         proxy.setSpot "Mediterranean Sea" ;         proxy.setSpot "Atlantic Ocean" ;          proxy.printSpot  ;         proxy.printSpot  ;         proxy.printSpot  ;     }                  }  [ 55 ]   Spring AOP Components  The result will be:  Let's see what has been done. We defined a target class   DynamicPointcutTargetExample , a DynamicPointcutMatcher with the definition  of the class and of the method valid for the match, an around advice that prints the  name of the invoked method before the invocation. Subsequently, the method is  invoked on the target class, and after the invocation, it prints Job Done. To test DynamicPointcutMatcher, we wrote the DynamicPointcutExample class  with a main method.  Then we created an advisor that bound pointcuts and advices. We also created a new  ProxyFactory to which we set advisors and target objects. Then, we invoked methods.  The result was that at the first invocation, a static check was done on methods called  from the proxy  the first four static checks . Then only when the static check was  satisfied, the dynamic check was called to verify if we should apply advice.   Operations on Pointcut  The Pointcut class exposes two methods for the union and intersection of pointcuts.  public static Pointcut union  Pointcut a, Pointcut b  public static Pointcut intersection  Pointcut a, Pointcut b   [ 56 ]   Chapter 2  The union of two pointcuts is the pointcut matching any method matched by either  pointcut  Boolean OR . The intersection matches only methods matched by both  pointcuts  Boolean AND .  Pointcuts can be composed using the static methods in the org.springframework. aop.support.Pointcuts  union and intersection  class, or using the  ComposablePointcut class in the same package.   ComposablePointcut The ComposablePointcut class is used to compose two or more pointcuts together  with operations such as union   and intersection  .  The full qualified name of the class is:  org.springframework.aop.support.ComposablePointcut   By default, ComposablePointcut is created with a ClassFilter that matches all the  classes and a MethodMatcher that matches all the methods.  We can supply our own initial ClassFilter and MethodMatcher if we like:  ComposablePointcut ClassFilter classFilter,  MethodMatcher methodMatcher   The union   and intersection   methods are both overloaded to accept  ClassFilter and MethodMatcher arguments.   Invoking the union   method, the MethodMatcher of ComposablePointcut   is replaced with a UnionMethodMatcher that uses the current MethodMatcher of   the ComposablePointcut and the MethodMatcher passed to the union   method   as arguments.   The UnionMethodMatcher method then returns true for a match if either of its  wrapped MethodMatchers returns true.   This way it is possible to invoke the union   method as many times as we want,  with each call creating a new UnionMethodMatcher that wraps the current  MethodMatcher with the MethodMatcher passed to union  .  Internally, the intersection   method works in a similar way to the union   .   Here is the target class:  package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  import java.util.Date;  public class ComposableTargetExample {  [ 57 ]   Spring AOP Components  startDate = new Date  ;  this.description = description;  startDate = new Date  ; this.description = description;  public ComposableTargetExample   {   } public ComposableTargetExample String description  {     }                    public void setDescription String description  {                     }    } public String getDescription   {   } public Date getStartDate   {   } private Date startDate; private String description;  return  Date  startDate.clone  ;  return description;  Here is the example class:  package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  import java.lang.reflect.Method;  import org.springframework.aop.Advisor; import org.springframework.aop.ClassFilter; import org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactory; import org.springframework.aop.support.ComposablePointcut; import org.springframework.aop.support.DefaultPointcutAdvisor; import org.springframework.aop.support.StaticMethodMatcher;  public class ComposablePointcutExample {     public static void main String[] args  {       ComposableTargetExample  ;   ComposableTargetExample target = new           ComposablePointcut pc = new ComposablePointcut   ClassFilter.TRUE,                 new GetterMethodMatcher   ;          System.out.println "Test GetterMetodMatcher :" ;         ComposableTargetExample proxy = getProxy pc, target ;         testInvoke proxy ;          System.out.println "Test GetterMetodMatcher UNION  SetterMethodMatcher :" ;         pc.union new SetterMethodMatcher   ;  [ 58 ]   Chapter 2          proxy = getProxy pc, target ;         testInvoke proxy ;          System.out.println "Test  GetterMetodMatcher UNION           SetterMethodMatcher  INTERSECT GetStartDateMethodMatcher :" ;         pc.intersection new GetStartDateMethodMatcher   ;         proxy = getProxy pc, target ;         testInvoke proxy ;     }            private static ComposableTargetExample getProxy       ComposablePointcut pc, ComposableTargetExample target  {          Advisor advisor = new DefaultPointcutAdvisor pc,                 new ComposableBeforeAdvice   ;         ProxyFactory pf = new ProxyFactory  ;         pf.setTarget target ;         pf.addAdvisor advisor ;         return  ComposableTargetExample  pf.getProxy  ;     }      private static void testInvoke ComposableTargetExample proxy  {                       proxy.setDescription "New Description" ;     }  proxy.getStartDate  ; proxy.getDescription  ;            private static class GetterMethodMatcher extends  StaticMethodMatcher {          public boolean matches Method method, Class cls  {             return  method.getName  .startsWith "get"  ;         }     }      private static class GetStartDateMethodMatcher extends  StaticMethodMatcher {         public boolean matches Method method, Class cls  {             return "getStartDate".equals method.getName   ;         }     }      private static class SetterMethodMatcher extends  StaticMethodMatcher {          public boolean matches Method method, Class cls  {             return  method.getName  .startsWith "set"  ;         }      } }  [ 59 ]   Spring AOP Components  The result will be:  Let's try to see what has been done. We defined a target class   ComposableTargetExample , a ComposableBeforeAdvice that prints    "ComposableBeforeAdvice".  To test ComposablePointcut we wrote the ComposableTargetExample class with a  main method.   In a getProxy method, we created an advisor that bound pointcuts and advices,  created a new ProxyFactory to which we set advisors and target objects, and  returned the target object.  In the testInvoke method, we invoked two Get methods and one Set method.  In the Main method, we created the pointcut declaring we wanted to use a  GetterMethodMatcher, and we called testInvoke. The result was the application  of the advice to two Get methods. Then we made a union of pointcuts that at the  beginning contained the GetterMethodMatcher with a SetterMethodMatcher,   and then we called the testInvoke method. The result was the application of the  advice three times.  Then we make the intersection with a GetStartDateMethodMatcher, and call the  testInvoke method. The result is the application of advice only on the method that  satisfies the intersection.   ControlFlowPointcut The ControlFlowPointcut is a pointcut that matches all methods within the control  flow of another method—that is, any method that is invoked either directly or  indirectly as the result of another method being invoked.  Control flow pointcuts allow us to apply advices to an object in a selective manner  depending on the context in which it is executed.  [ 60 ]   The full qualified name of the class is:  org.springframework.aop.support.ControlFlowPointcut   However, we have to pay attention to the performance we get when using it. The  Spring documentation indicates that a control flow pointcut is typically five times  slower than other pointcuts on a 1.4  VM, and ten times slower on a 1.3  VM.  Chapter 2        }           }    }  Here is the target class:  package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  public class ControlFlowTargetExample {  public void greeting  {   }  System.out.println "Cheers" ;  This is the before advice:   package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  import java.lang.reflect.Method; import org.springframework.aop.MethodBeforeAdvice;  public class ControlFlowBeforeAdvice implements MethodBeforeAdvice {  public void before Method method, Object[] args, Object target     throws Throwable {     System.out.println "ControlFlow beforeAdvice " ;  Here is the example class:  package org.springaop.chapter.two.pointcut;  import org.springframework.aop.Advisor; import org.springframework.aop.Pointcut; import org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactory; import org.springframework.aop.support.ControlFlowPointcut; import org.springframework.aop.support.DefaultPointcutAdvisor;  public class ControlFlowPointcutExample {    public static void main String[] args  {      ControlFlowPointcutExample ex = new       ControlFlowPointcutExample  ;              ex.run  ;     }  [ 61 ]   Spring AOP Components         public void run   {          ControlFlowTargetExample target = new     ControlFlowTargetExample  ;          Pointcut pc = new ControlFlowPointcut ControlFlowPointcutE    xample.class, "test" ;              Advisor advisor = new DefaultPointcutAdvisor pc,                 new ControlFlowBeforeAdvice   ;                 ProxyFactory pf = new ProxyFactory  ;         pf.setTarget target ;         pf.addAdvisor advisor ;          ControlFlowTargetExample proxy =      ControlFlowTargetExample  pf.getProxy  ;          System.out.println "Trying normal invoke" ;         proxy.greeting  ;         System.out.println "Trying under         ControlFlowPointcutExample.test  " ;              test proxy ;     }      private void test ControlFlowTargetExample bean  {         bean.greeting  ;     }         }  The result will be:  Let's see what has been done. We defined a target class   ControlFlowTargetExample , a ControlFlowBeforeAdvice that   prints ControlFlow beforeAdvice. To test ControlFlowPointcut, we wrote the we wrote the ControlFlowPointcutExample class  with a main method that only calls a run method, where we put the real test body.  We did this to show the effects of the flow of a calling of a method from a given class.  [ 62 ]   Chapter 2  The result was that when the method was called directly by the proxy, the  advice was not applied, whereas when the call came from within another object   ControlFlowPointcutExample in this case , the advice was applied.  Pointcut constants For the common operations, pointcut constants are available in this package:  org.springframework.aop.support.Pointcuts  The constants are:  GETTERS is a constant Pointcut object, matching all bean property getters, in   any class.  SETTERS is a constant Pointcut object matching all bean property setter in any class.  Joinpoint  A joinpoint is a well-defined point during the execution of your application. Typical  examples of joinpoints include a method call, method execution, class initialization,  and object instantiation. Joinpoints are a core concept of AOP and define the points   in your application at which you can insert additional logic using AOP.  Spring AOP only supports one joinpoint type—method invocation. This makes  Spring more accessible. But if we need to advise some code at a joinpoint other   than a method invocation, we can always use Spring and Aspect  together.  Advice An advice specifies what must be done at a joinpoint.   Spring uses a chain of interceptors to wrap the invocation of the method and   apply to it the advices contained into this chain. As said before, Spring is consistent  with the specifications of the AOP Alliance, but provides a slightly different  programming model.  The AOP Alliance defines the MethodInterceptor interface:  public interface org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInterceptor extends  Interceptor {        Object invoke MethodInvocation invocation  throws Throwable; }  [ 63 ]   Spring AOP Components  By implementing this interface and using the invocation.proceed   method, it is  possible to build a chain of interceptors with the same behavior as filter servlets. In  the following figure, we can see this behavior:  Caller object  AOP Proxy  Advisor   Interceptor  Advisor   Interceptor  Target Method  Spring, on the other hand, provides prepared advices that extend the   org.aopalliance.aop.Advice interface.  In the following figure, we can see a diagram of the hierarchy of advices:  Advice   from prg::aopalliance::aop    >  After Advice   >  BeforeAdvice   >  DynamicIntroductionAdvice   >  AfterRetumingAdvice   >  ThrowsAdvice   >  MethodBeforeAdvice   >  IntroductionInterceptor  Advices have been presented with some examples in Chapter 1, but now we will see  them in greater detail.  Let's say that as good practice you have to choose the advice that best meets   your requirements.  Before advice Before advice interposes actions before the joinpoint. Spring provides the   org.springframework.aop.BeforeAdvice interface, and in order to use it we   have to implement an interface that extends it and has the following signature:  [ 64 ]   Chapter 2                           public interface MethodBeforeAdvice extends BeforeAdvice {      void before Method m, Object[] args, Object target  throws  Throwable; }  Our implementation will then be called before the jointpoint. We will put the logic  we want to execute into the body of the before method. This type of advice is  particularly appropriate for pre-test  before  operations.  package org.springaop.chapter.two.advice;  import java.lang.reflect.Method; import java.util.logging.Logger;  import org.springframework.aop.MethodBeforeAdvice;  public class BeforeAdvice implements MethodBeforeAdvice {  logger.fine traceInvocation m, args, target  ;   do something      public void before Method m, Object[] args, Object target  {                 }     private String traceInvocation Method m, Object[] args, Object  target  {   getName   ;                      }  sb.append "with args :" .append args ; sb.append "on object :" .append target ; return sb.toString  ;  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder "Invoked method :" .append m.  After returning advice This executes logic after the method executed at the joinpoint gives back control to  the calling method in a normal way, that is, without throwing any exception.  Spring provides the org.springframework.aop.AfterAdvice interface, whose  extension must be implemented. Its signature is:   public interface org.springframework.aop.AfterReturningAdvice extends  Advice {         void afterReturning Object returnValue, Method m,              Object[] args, Object target              throws Throwable; }  [ 65 ]   Spring AOP Components  This advice can't modify the value returned to the target caller.                                          Example:  package org.springaop.chapter.two.advice;  import java.lang.reflect.Method; import java.util.logging.Logger;  import org.springframework.aop.AfterReturningAdvice;  public class AfterAdvice implements AfterReturningAdvice {       public void afterReturning Object returnValue, Method m, Object[]  args,                            Object target  {  logger.fine traceResultInvocation m, args,         target,returnValue  ;     }  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder "Invoked method :" .  private String traceResultInvocation Method m, Object[] args,        Object target,Object returnValue  {   append m.getName   ;                           }  sb.append "with args :" .append args ; sb.append "on object :" .append target ; sb.append "return value :" .append returnValue ; return sb.toString  ;  After throwing advice This advice is called after an exception has been thrown. It's therefore suitable   for tracing and possibly correcting or signalling actions after an exception of a  particular kind.  The org.springframework.aop.ThrowsAdvice interface is a Tag Interface.  There are no methods, as methods are invoked by reflection. Implementing classes  must implement methods of the form:  void afterThrowing [Method, args, target], ThrowableSubclass ;  [ 66 ]   Chapter 2  This means, as explained in the reference documentation, it can be a method in one  of the following forms:  public void afterThrowing Exception ex ; public void afterThrowing RemoteException ; public void afterThrowing Method method, Object[] args, Object target,  Exception ex ; public void afterThrowing Method method, Object[] args, Object target,  ServletException ex ;  All the parameters  excluding the exception  are used to have further information,  but in fact are optional.  Example:  package org.springaop.chapter.two.advice;  import java.lang.reflect.Method; import java.util.logging.Logger;  import org.springframework.aop.ThrowsAdvice;  public class RuntimeExceptionAdvice implements ThrowsAdvice {      public void afterThrowing Method m, Object[] args, Object target,    RuntimeException ex  { RuntimeException ex  {     logger.fine traceExceptionContext m, args, target, ex  ;         }}  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder «Exception on method   private String traceExceptionContext Method m, Object[] args,        Object target, RuntimeException ex  {   :» .append m.getName   ;                           }  sb.append «with args :» .append args ; sb.append «on object :» .append target ; sb.append «exception msg :» .append ex.getMessage   ; return sb.toString  ;  Advisor The advisor isn't a concept from AOP in general, but is specific to Spring AOP.  The advisor links together pointcuts and advice. So it contains both the action to be  executed  defined in the advice  and the point where it is to be executed  defined in  the pointcut . The advisor's role is to decouple pointcuts and advice, in order to reuse  them independently from each other.  [ 67 ]   Spring AOP Components  The Advisor interface allows support for different types of advice, such as before and  after advice, which need not be implemented using interception.  public interface Advisor {        Advice getAdvice   ;        boolean perInstance  ; }  In the following figure, we can see the diagram of the hierarchy of advisors:   >  Advisor   > IntroductionInfo   >  IntroductionAdvisor   > PointcutAdvisor  When we call addAdvice   on a ProxyFactory:  pf.addAdvice new AfterAdviceExample   ;  the addAdvice delegates to addAdvisor   behind the scenes, creating an instance   of DefaultPointcutAdvisor and configuring it with a pointcut that points to   all methods.  The addAdvisor creates a DefaultPointcutAdvisor, and it applies a pointcut that   targets all the methods. This is the default behavior when Spring uses the canonical  instance Pointcut.TRUE.  The most common implementation to use is provided by Spring:   org.springframework.aop.support.DefaultPointcutAdvisor   It can be used in a programmatic way:   Advisor advisorExample = new DefaultPointcutAdvisor pointcutExample,  adviceExample ;   [ 68 ]   Chapter 2  or in a declarative way:   <bean name ="advisorExample" class="org.springframework.aop.support.DefaultPointcutAdvisor">                    In the earlier section  with various MethodMatchers , we have seen the use of  advisors in programmatic way.  Introductions Introductions are a very strong component of the Spring AOP. They permit us   to dynamically introduce new one-object functionalities as the implementation   of interfaces on existing objects:           To create a mixin, adding to the state held in the object. This is probably the  most important use. To expose additional states associated with a special TargetSource. This is  used within Spring, for example, with scripting support. To expose an object or object graph in a different way—for example, making  an object graph implement the XML DOM interfaces.  Introductions are often mixins that allow one to obtain the effects of multiple  inheritance in  ava.  To allow the implementation of interfaces at runtime rather than more simply at  compile time makes sense in cases where the crosscutting functionalities don't   allow us to easily choose the way at compile time.  In the documentation of Spring 1.x, we had introductions, object locking, and  modification detection as examples of use.  In the case of object locking, to lock an object's internal state we should implement  the Lockable interface. All the objects that we want to have the functionalities  should implement it, duplicating in this way the implementation in all the objects.  Otherwise, we should create a base class that contains the implementation, but the  classes that would modify its state should anyway do a state check.  [ 69 ]   Spring AOP Components  In this situation, we can centralize the implementation on introductions, and have  classes at runtime that implement the Lockable interface. This interface becomes an  instance of Lockable.  The implementation can be controlled by the introduction. In Spring AOP it extends  MethodInterceptor, and thus can intercept the calls before the exception is thrown  if the object is "locked".  This example shows how introductions are suitable to be used in   declarative services.  As we have mentioned, for Spring an introduction is a special type of AroundAdvice.  But we have to be careful because it is applied at the level of Class, and pointcuts  can't be used: This is because an introduction adds the implementation of an  interface, whereas pointcuts choose which method to apply to the advice.   Spring simplifies the use by providing DelegatingIntroductionInterceptor,  an implementation of the IntroductionInterceptor interface, which has to be  extended where we have to implement the interfaces that we want to introduce.  Then, to add the introduction, we use a special Advisor—the IntroductionAdvisor,  of which the implementation DefaultIntroductionAdvisor is used.  We have to pay attention to the fact that whereas a normal advice can be applied  to any object since it has a per-class lifecycle, an introduction has a per-instance  lifecycle. So we must have a different instance for each advised object, and the  ProxyFactory.addAdvice   method mustn't be called because it would throw   an exception.   The interface of introductionAdvisor is as follows:  public interface IntroductionAdvisor extends Advisor, IntroductionInfo  {  ClassFilter getClassFilter  ; void validateInterfaces   throws IllegalArgumentException;  ClassFilter is useful to show the classes on which it must be used.   The ValidateInterfaces method is used internally to determine whether one of  introduced interface can be implemented or not.   The implementation of IntroductionAdvisor has to implement this as well:   public interface IntroductionInfo {  Class[] getInterfaces  ;  }  }  [ 70 ]   Here is an example:  We want to manage to call sets on Object domains just once, and just if the variables  are null, because they haven't been valorised through the default constructor  DomainObjectTarget  :  Chapter 2  package org.springaop.chapter.two.introduction;  public class DomainObjectTarget {  public DomainObjectTarget  {}  return description;  this.description = description;  this.description = description; this.id = id;  public DomainObjectTarget String description, Integer id {     } public String getDescription   {   } public void setDescription String description  {   } public Integer getId   {   } public void setId Integer id  {   } public boolean isNew  {   } private String description; private Integer id = null;  return null == description && null == id;  this.id = id;  return id;  This is the interface to be applied:   package org.springaop.chapter.two.introduction;  public interface IsModifiable {  public boolean isModifiable  ;                                               }    }  [ 71 ]   Spring AOP Components  Here is the advisor:  package org.springaop.chapter.two.introduction;  public class IsModifiableAdvisor extends DefaultIntroductionAdvisor {  public IsModifiableAdvisor  {   }  super new IsModifiableMixin   ;        }  Here is the mixin class:  package org.springaop.chapter.two.introduction;  import java.lang.reflect.Method; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;  import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInvocation; import org.springframework.aop.support.

[ 74 ]   Chapter 2  Summary The aim of this chapter was to show the basic components of Spring AOP, pointcut,  joinpoint, advice, advisor, and introduction.  Each one realizes a component of the AOP functions, using joinpoints that are the  invocations of methods and advisors, specific to Spring.  This chapter describes advices: the results obtained and the most appropriate  application scenarios, and introductions, which are one of the most powerful  components because they allow the application the implementation of interfaces   to any object. In this chapter we saw one example for each of the advices. We will  look at the same components in Chapter 4, but using Aspect  to allow a much easier  and shorter configuration both through annotations and using XML Schema.  [ 75 ]    Spring AOP Proxies  In this chapter, we will discuss how to get started with Spring AOP proxies.   Some of the topics discussed in this chapter are:              DK and CGLIB proxy Creating proxy programmatically ProxyFactoryBean Autoproxies Target sources  Proxy It is proxies that realize AOP in Spring and allow the application of crosscutting  functionalities. We will see the application of proxies both in the classic version of  Spring, and with the support of Aspect  with annotations and XML Schema. We will  also see the possible matching of configuration to adapt proxies to our demands, and  use their advanced features.  Proxy is a structural design pattern that is a part of the 23 design patterns of the   GoF  Gang of Four  composed by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph  ohnson,   and  ohn Vlissides. The idea put into practice by Proxy is to wrap an object and intercept all the calls  made to it and take its place, so that the calling object has the feeling of interacting  with the object rather than the proxy.  caller  proxy  object   Spring AOP Proxies  Since a proxy intercepts all the calls to the object, it can also decide to call some other  application logic before making a call to the object, or to execute some application  logic before giving back the object's answer, or it can even not send the call to the  object. Given these features, the proxy is the ideal point to introduce and execute  chains of actions to be performed before or after the calls to the object.  In our case, the chains of actions are the crosscutting concerns to be applied to  specific joinpoints. To realize this structural behavior pattern of Proxy, we have   two choices: implementing it or using appropriate classes provided by  DK 1.3   and upwards.  The only constraint is that the object must implement one or more interface, and that  only the methods present in the interface s  must be intercepted.  Another way is to use the CGLIB library  CGLIB is a powerful high-performance  code generation library , which doesn't require implementation of an interface.  JDK proxy To realize a dynamic proxy with  DK, we need to implement the interface that  manages invocations.  package java.lang.reflect;  public interface InvocationHandler {  public Object invoke Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args  throws Throwable; }  The method to implement receives the proxy object, the invoked method, and   the input parameters of the target method. An implementation would be made   like this:  package org.springaop.chapter.three.handler;  import java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler; import java.lang.reflect.Method; import java.lang.reflect.Proxy;  public class FooInvocationHandler implements InvocationHandler {  public FooInvocationHandler Object target  {   }  this.target = target;  public Object invoke Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args     throws Throwable {                 [ 78 ]   System.out.println "remove before fly :- " ;  Object result = method.invoke target, args ;  System.out.println result+", mmh it's not rocket science " ; return result;   Chapter 3  public static Object createProxy Object target  {         }  return Proxy.newProxyInstance         target.getClass  .getClassLoader  , target.getClass  .getInterfaces  ,  new FooInvocationHandler target  ;         private Object target;                       }                  }  The constructor receives the target object on which the invocation will be made.  The invoke method performs the invocation of the method on the target object   second argument  using an array of parameters  third argument . The proxy    first argument  is not needed in this case. The createProxy method creates a   new proxy, initializing it with the classloader and interfaces of the target class.   The handler would be used in this way:  package org.springaop.chapter.three.handler;  public static void main String[] args  {   Info info = new DefaultInfo  ;     Info information =  Info  FooInvocationHandler.  information.isJmxEnabled  ;       createProxy info ;   }     The result will be:  [ 79 ]   Spring AOP Proxies  CGLIB proxy In the beginning, the use of the CGLIB library was introduced in Spring 1.1 because  JDK 1.3 proxies weren't really efficient. With versions 1.4 and following, they   have been improved. However, even with  DK 1.5, CGLIB proxies are still three  times faster.   Despite all this, we have to notice that  DK proxies need an interface to do their job,  and only the methods declared in the interface can be used by the proxy. But this is  not always possible, particularly when the code we deal with is written by others.  In this case, it's better to use CGLIB proxies that don't require the presence of  interfaces to implement. CGLIB proxies generate the bytecode for the new class on  the fly for each proxy, reusing in those cases that were already created. This allows  some optimizations.  But we have to be clear that to use CGLIB proxies, we need to have the CGLIB  AR.  Whereas with JDK, any JAR is required.  Moreover, if we deal with final methods,  we cannot do the override, and so we can apply any advice.   The creation of CGLIB  proxies is completely transparent for Spring users, since  it's provided as one of the two implementations of the class used with Spring—the  ProxyFactory and  DK proxy.  Creating proxies programmatically In some situations it could be necessary to create proxies programmatically    for example in test classes , in the classic manner or with classes annotated   with "@Aspect".  ClassicProxy To see a proxy in action, we will use as example class a class that implements a  Command Pattern. A Command Pattern is used when a client class doesn't know   the details about an implementation of the called class that executes some logic.  package org.springaop.chapter.three.proxy;  public interface Command {  public void execute  ;    }  [ 80 ]   Chapter 3  We define an interface that implements the Command Pattern    http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Command_pattern .  package org.springaop.chapter.three.proxy;  public class CommandImpl implements Command{  public void execute  {   }  System.out.println label ;  private final String label = "Goooo !";  We create a class that implements the interface.  package org.springaop.chapter.three.proxy;  public class BeforeAdviceProxyExample implements MethodBeforeAdvice{  public void before Method arg0, Object[] arg1, Object arg2     throws Throwable {     System.out.println "I'm a proxied invocation" ;  We create a MethodBeforeAdvice to execute before the execute method.  package org.springaop.chapter.three.proxy;  public class ProxyFactoryExample {     public static void main String[] args  {           target class       Command target = new CommandImpl  ;     create the proxy ProxyFactory pf = new ProxyFactory  ;    add interface pf.addInterface Command.class ;     add pointcut        NameMatchMethodPointcut pc = new NameMatchMethodPointcut  ;      pc.addMethodName "execute" ;         add advisor     Advisor advisor = new DefaultPointcutAdvisor pc, new       BeforeAdviceProxyExample   ;  [ 81 ]           }             }                       }             Spring AOP Proxies              }                }  pf.addAdvisor advisor ;     setTarget pf.setTarget target ;  Command proxy =  Command  pf.getProxy  ; proxy.execute  ;  In the test class we instantiate the target class CommandImpl, create the  ProxyFactory, to which we add the interface on which the proxy  Command class   has to operate. We create the pointcut to which we append the names of the methods  to intercept.  Then we create the advisor, passing the pointcut and the BeforeAdviceExample. We  add the advisor and the target to the ProxyFactory. Finally, we retrieve the proxy  class that is seen as the Command interface and invoke the method on the proxy.  The result will be:  With the instruction pf.setExposeProxy true , we could have at  our disposal the proxy as ThreadLocal to retrieve it with the class  AopContext; by default it is false to improve performance. Usually, it is used if a class on which an advice is applied has to call  another method on itself, advised too.  If it uses this, the invocation will  not be advised.   AspectJProxy It is also possible to programmatically create Aspect  aspects using the   @Aspect annotation.  The class org.springframework.aop.aspectj.annotation.AspectJProxyFactory  can be used to create a proxy for a target object that is advised by one or more   Aspect  aspects.  [ 82 ]   Chapter 3  package org.springaop.chapter.three.proxy;  import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect; import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before; import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Pointcut; import org.springframework.aop.aspectj.annotation.AspectJProxyFactory;  @Aspect public class BeforeAspectJProxyExample {  @Pointcut "execution * org.springaop.chapter.three.proxy.    CommandImpl.execute ..  "  void beforeExecute  {}    @Before "beforeExecute  "  public void before   {   }  System.out.println "I'm a AspectJ proxied invocation" ;  public static void main String[] args  {  Command target = new CommandImpl  ; AspectJProxyFactory factory = new AspectJProxyFactory target  factory.addAspect BeforeAspectJProxyExample.class ; Command proxy = factory.getProxy  ; proxy.execute  ;                   ;         }             }  The annotation @Aspect marks a class as an aspect.  The annotation @Pointcut marks the method beforeExecute   as a pointcut that  can be used as parameter in the annotation @Before.  These annotations enable the crosscutting functionality in this class, instead of in the  programmatic way that we saw in the previous chapters.  ProxyFactoryBean As we've previously seen, we have at our disposal two kinds of proxies: the ones  provided by  DK, which we can also write as seen in the previous section, and those  provided by the CGLIB, which work in a transparent manner.  In everyday use, we don't directly use either of the two implementations. We rather  rely on a factory that provides the proxy class ready for use. This allows us to focus  our attention and development on crosscutting concerns to apply through the proxy,  rather than focus on the proxy.  [ 83 ]   Spring AOP Proxies  To make our job easier Spring provides the class org.springframework.aop. config.ProxyFactoryBean, and we mostly use it in a declarative way by doing  the "dirty work" that we have seen. It is necessary to create and use proxies in a  programmatic way. ProxyFactoryBean is a central component in SpringAOP  because if proxies act as links among advices, targets, joinpoints, and advisors, the  ProxyFactoryBean performs its tasks in a declarative manner rather than by code   in a programmatic manner.   As a factory bean, it creates beans of the required type by introducing a layer of  indirection and allowing the creation of different types of objects. The intrinsic  advantage that it brings is the use of IoC to use AOP and its components.  The interface of the ProxyFactoryBean is as follows:                   setTarget: Specify the target object you want to proxy. setProxyTargetClass: The default behavior is the following:        If an interface is available, it's used as a  DK proxy. If an interface is not available, it's used as a CGLIB proxy. If we set the value to true, it's used as a CGLIB proxy.  setOptimize: If a CGLIB proxy is used, this instruction tells the proxy to  apply some aggressive optimizations. It doesn't have any effect if the proxy   is a  DK proxy. setFrozen: The default value is false. If a proxy configuration is frozen,  then changes to the configuration are no longer allowed. This is useful as a  slight optimization, and is also useful for those cases where you don't want  callers to be able to manipulate the proxy  via the Advised interface , after  the proxy has been created. setExposeProxy: If a target needs to obtain the proxy and the exposeProxy  property is set to true, the target can use the AopContext.currentProxy  .  The proxy is exposed in a ThreadLocal so that it can be accessed by   the target. setAopProxyFactory: The implementation of AopProxyFactory offers a  way of customizing whether to use dynamic proxies, CGLIB, or any other  proxy strategy.   [ 84 ]                        Parameters that can be passed to the ProxyFactoryBean's constructor:  Chapter 3  proxyInterfaces: These are an array of String interface names. If they aren't  supplied, a CGLIB proxy for the target class will be used. interceptorNames: These are a string array of Advisor, interceptor, or  other advice names to apply. Ordering is significant, on a first-come-first- served basis. That is to say, the first interceptor in the list will be the first to  be able to intercept the invocation. The names are bean names in the current  factory, including those from the ancestor factories. You can't mention  bean references here since doing so would result in the ProxyFactoryBean  ignoring the singleton setting of the advice. You can append an interceptor  name with an asterisk  * . This will result in the application of all advisor  beans with names starting with the part before the asterisk to be applied.  singleton: If true, a singleton pattern is applied  the factory creates a single  instance of the object and returns it at every getObject   invocation .  The default value is true. If you want to use stateful advice, use prototype  advices along with a singleton value of false.  ProxyFactoryBean and proxies Now we will see the strategy with which the ProxyFactoryBean chooses whether to  use a  DK proxy or a CGLIB proxy, and the manner in which it autonomously gets  the presence of interfaces. Scenarios:  If the target class doesn't implement interfaces, a CGLIB proxy is created. In  this case, we simply have to indicate the list of interceptors to introduce as  interceptorNames. If the target class implements one or more interfaces,   the creation of the type of proxy depends on the configuration in detail. If the property proxyTargetClass of the ProxyFactoryBean is true, a  CGLIB proxy is created even if the property proxyInterfaces is set with  one or more interfaces. If the property feature proxyTargetClass isn't set and the feature  proxyInterfaces is set with one or more interfaces, a  DK proxy that  implements these interfaces declared in proxyInterfaces is created. If the property proxyInterfaces is not set, but the target class actually  implements one or more interfaces, the ProxyFactoryBean detects the   fact that the object implements interfaces and creates a  DK proxy.  Unfortunately, with this self-discovery, the proxy implements all the  interfaces of the class—not only those we wish and that are indicated with  the feature proxyInterfaces—if the class implements several interfaces.  [ 85 ]   Spring AOP Proxies  ProxyFactoryBean in action After having seen the main features and strategies on the type of proxy created, we  are going to see how the ProxyFactoryBean must be configured in XML.  In this example we have three "anemic" objects—User, Command, and PersonUser.  The User implementation has two interfaces, while the Command implementation has  only one, and the PersonUser doesn't implement any interface at all. We will see  how to configure the bean factory with some lists of interceptors, and how to choose  which interfaces must be considered by the proxy.  The interfaces:  package org.springaop.chapter.three.domain;  public interface User {  public String getName  ; public String getSurname  ;  package org.springaop.chapter.three.domain;  public interface Address {  public String getAddress  ; public String getNation  ; public String getState  ;  package org.springaop.chapter.three.domain;  public interface Command {  public Object execute  ;  The following class implements the User and Address interfaces:  package org.springaop.chapter.three.domain;  public class UserImpl implements User, Address {  public String getAddress   {   }  return address;  public String getNation   {   }  return nation;  public String getState   {  [ 86 ]      }         }    }                    Chapter 3                                                          }                     }    }  return state;  public String getName   {   }  return name;  public String getSurname   {   }  return surname;  public void setAddress String address  {   }  this.address = address;  public void setNation String nation  {   }  this.nation = nation;  public void setState String state  {   }  this.state = state;  public void setName String name  {   }  this.name = name;  public void setSurname String surname  {   }  this.surname = surname;  private String address, nation, state, name, surname;  The following class contains implementation of the method execute, which  performs the print of a point on a new line in the output on console and file:  package org.springaop.chapter.three.domain;  public class CommandImpl implements Command {  public Object execute   {         }  for  int x = 0; x < 1000; x++  {   } return null;  action  ;  private void action   {   }  System.out.println "\n ." ;  [ 87 ]                          }    {  Spring AOP Proxies  The following class PersonUser doesn't implement any interface:  package org.springaop.chapter.three.domain;  public class PersonUser {  public String getName  {   }  return user.getName  ;  public String getSurname  {   }  return user.getSurname  ;  public void setUser User user  {   }  this.user = user;  private User user;  After the three principal classes, we see the interceptors used in the example.  In the following code, we have the interceptor MethodLoggerInterceptor that logs  the executions of methods and writes to files through log4j, which is an appropriate  library for logging.  The method invoke receives the MethodInvocation that contains all runtime  information about invocation.  package org.springaop.chapter.three;  import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInterceptor; import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInvocation; import org.apache.log4j.Logger; import org.springaop.chapter.three.util.Constants;  public class MethodLoggerInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor {  public Object invoke MethodInvocation invocation  throws Throwable            Logger log = Logger.getLogger Constants.LOG_NAME ; StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder  ; sb.append "\n Method:" .append invocation.getMethod               getClass   .append   "\n with arguments:" .append invocation. getArguments   ;    .append "\n on class:" .append invocation.  log.info sb.toString   ;        [ 88 ]   Chapter 3  Object retVal = invocation.proceed  ; log.info "\n return value:" + retVal ; return retVal;        }          }  The TimeExecutionInterceptor class measures the time before and after the   method's invocation. It uses the class StopWatch, which is a class of Spring, to  measure the milliseconds used for the execution of the method invoked from the  interceptor's interior.   It performs a dump of the invocation, recording through log4j the invoked method,  the class on which it was invoked, the input arguments, and the return value.  package org.springaop.chapter.three;  import java.lang.reflect.Method;  import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInterceptor; import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInvocation; import org.apache.log4j.Logger; import org.springaop.chapter.three.util.Constants; import org.springframework.util.StopWatch;  public class TimeExecutionInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor{    public Object invoke MethodInvocation invocation  throws Throwable{                                                        long timeBeforeMethodExecution = 0; long timeAfterMethodExecution = 0;  Logger log = Logger.getLogger Constants.LOG_NAME ;     Spring util class StopWatch sw = new StopWatch  ;  log.info new StringBuilder "\n Time before execution:"     .append timeBeforeMethodExecution  ;     sw.start invocation.getMethod  .getName   ;  Object returnValue = invocation.proceed  ;  sw.stop  ;       timeAfterMethodExecution = System.currentTimeMillis  ; log.info new StringBuilder "\n Time after execution:"                  .append  timeAfterMethodExecution -             timeBeforeMethodExecution  .append " ms" .append             "\n result:" .append returnValue  ;  [ 89 ]   Spring AOP Proxies                    }         log  {  dumpInfo invocation, sw.getTotalTimeMillis  , log ;  return returnValue;  private void dumpInfo MethodInvocation invocation, long ms, Logger   Method m = invocation.getMethod  ; Object[] args = invocation.getArguments  ;  log.info new StringBuilder "\n Method :" .append m.

Once we've loaded them we do the lookup of three beans, user,  command, and personUser.  The proxy returns the bean user from the target class UserImpl, which implements  two interfaces, of which we want the proxy to use just one. To this bean the  ProxyFactoryBean applies the methodLoggerInterceptor, which logs class,  method, and arguments on the method on which the methods defined in the User  interface are invoked.  [ 94 ]   Chapter 3  The bean command is what the proxy returns from the target class  CommandImpl, which implements just one interface. To this bean, it applies the  timeExecutionInterceptor that logs the time needed for method's invocations.  Bean personUser is the bean the proxy returns from the target class PersonUser,  which doesn't implement any interface. To this the ProxyFactoryBean applies the  methodLoggerInterceptor. It logs class, method, and arguments to the method on  which methods defined on the PersonUser class are invoked.  Output:  [ 95 ]   Spring AOP Proxies  We can organize interceptors so that we don't need to list them all, for example by  giving a prefix to names of the interceptors—for example profile; we can use it in  the interceptorsName list with profile*.        <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans"  xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"  xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd">  …  <bean id="profileMethodLoggerInterceptor"      class="org.springaop.chapter.three.MethodLoggerInterceptor" >  <bean id="profileTimeExecutionInterceptor"      class="org.springaop.chapter.three.TimeExecutionInterceptor" >  <bean id="command"      class="org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean">      <property name="proxyInterfaces" value="org.springaop.chapter. three.domain.Command" >             <  property>                                                      profile*                                        …     In order to simplify the XML necessary for the configuration, we might as well   define an abstract template, for example to define the list of interceptors list, and   declare as the abstract template's parent all the beans that need that particular list   of interceptors list.   The possibility to define a bean abstract and use it as a completion of other beans is  available in any Spring configuration.  A bean can be a parent of just one bean.  Let's see a configuration's example with a bean abstract, and a bean that is a parent  of the abstract one.  <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"  xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd"> …   ProxyFactoryBean" parent="profileInterceptorTemplate">  <bean id="user" class="org.springframework.aop.framework.

It's significant to note that Spring even allows the manipulation of proxies, with the  org.springframework.aop.framework.Advised interface that is implemented by  proxies. The default operations exposed by this interface can be can be done on an  existing proxy.  An exception is constituted by the introductions  introduction advisor , which   can't be applied on the already created proxy.  If necessary, a new proxy instance   is requested.   Advisor[] getAdvisors  ;  This returns the advisor's array contained in the proxy.  void addAdvice Advice advice  throws AopConfigException;  This allows the addition of an advice.  void addAdvice int pos, Advice advice  throws AopConfigException;  This adds an advice at the specified position  the order reflects the order of  application to the target object .  void addAdvisor Advisor advisor  throws AopConfigException;  [ 97 ]   Spring AOP Proxies  This adds an advisor. If that's an interceptor, it is wrapped in a  DefaultPointcutAdvisor, which uses a pointcut that always returns   true, and as an interceptor it returns the passed argument.  void addAdvisor int pos, Advisor advisor  throws AopConfigException;  This adds an advisor at the defined position. If that's an interceptor it is wrapped in a  DefaultPointcutAdvisor, which uses a pointcut that always returns true, and   as an interceptor returns the passed argument.  int indexOf Advisor advisor ;  This returns the index where the advisor is:  boolean removeAdvisor Advisor advisor  throws AopConfigException;  This removes an advisor.  void removeAdvisor int index  throws AopConfigException;  This removes the advisor at the specified position.  boolean replaceAdvisor Advisor a, Advisor b  throws  AopConfigException;  This replaces an advisor with another one.   boolean isFrozen  ;  This signals if it's in the frozen state  already explained in the chapter .  Now let's see an example.  package org.springaop.chapter.three;  import org.springaop.proxies.proxyfactorybean.domain.Command; import org.springframework.aop.Advisor; import org.springframework.aop.framework.Advised; import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext; import org.springframework.context.support.

First of all, a bean  command  that we know is behind a proxy is retrieved.  Another bean is retrieved because it's known to be an advisor containing pointcut  and advice. After that, we obtain pieces of information from command through the  advised interface.  We could even add other advisors at runtime in particular positions by calling the  addAdvisor methods on the advised object, and specifying the positions where we  want to add them.  applicationContext.xml:  <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans"  xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"  xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd">  …  <bean id="commandTarget"       class="org.springaop.chapter.three.domain.CommandImpl" >  …  <bean id="consoleAdvice"       class="org.springaop.chapter.three.ConsoleAdvice" >      <bean id="consoleAdvisor" class="org.springframework.aop.support.

The adoption of freezing the proxy state is advisable. For example, when you're  already managing an aspect concerning security, removing any type of advice or  interceptor would mean revoking the authorization rules.   Autoproxy Spring also allows us to use "autoproxy" bean definitions, which can automatically  proxy selected bean definitions.  [ 100 ]   Chapter 3  Autoproxy with classic Spring In the section about ProxyFactoryBean, we saw how to use AOP in the classic way.  But it's clear that writing seperately for each bean on which we want to apply an  advisor is not a pleasant thing to see, especially if they are many. So let's consider it  as a practicable way only if the beans to be configured in that modality are few.  On the other hand, if the beans to which we have to apply AOP are many, in order   to avoid finding ourselves with very long configuration files, we adopt another   tactic: We use the auto proxy creator system, which allows us to automatically   create proxies for the beans and avoid using ProxyFactoryBean.  There are two classes made available by Spring to allow the autoproxy creator:  BeanNameAutoProxyCreator and DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator.  BeanNameAutoProxyCreator BeanNameAutoProxyCreator just has a list of beans names to which proxies can be  created automatically.  The way in which the autoproxy is created is really simple. It implements the  BeanPostProcessor interface, which in its implementation replaces the bean    target  with a proxy.  Example:  This is the interface describing an animal.  package org.springaop.chapter.three.autoproxy.domain;           }       }  public interface Animal {  public Integer getNumberPaws  ; public Boolean hasTail  ; public boolean hasFur  ; public Boolean hasHotBlood  ;  The interface Bird extends Animal.  package org.springaop.chapter.three.autoproxy.domain;  public interface Bird extends Animal{  public Boolean hasBeak  ; public Boolean hasFeathers  ;  [ 101 ]   Spring AOP Proxies  The class that implements the Animal interface to describe Cat:  package org.springaop.chapter.three.autoproxy.domain;  public class Cat implements Animal{  public boolean hasFur   {   }  return true;  public Integer getNumberPaws   {   }  return 4;  public Boolean hasTail   {   }  return true;  public Boolean hasHotBlood   {   }  return true;  public void setSpecies String species  {   }  this.species = species;  public String getSpecies   {   }  return species;  public String getColour   {   }  return colour;  public void setColour String colour  {   }  this.colour = colour;  private String species, colour;                                                            }         The class that implements Animal and Bird to describe a Seabird:  package org.springaop.chapter.three.autoproxy.domain;  public class Seabird implements Animal,Bird{  public Integer getNumberPaws   {   }  return 2;  [ 102 ]   Chapter 3  public Boolean hasTail   {   }  return false;  public Boolean hasBeak   {   }  return true;  public Boolean hasFeathers   {   }  return true;  public boolean hasFur   {   }  return false;  public Boolean hasHotBlood   {   }  return false;  public String getName   {   }  return name;  public void setName String name  {   }  this.name = name;  private String name;                                                     }  AnimalAdvice containing just the log with the target class, the invoked method, and  the result:  package org.springaop.chapter.three.autoproxy;  import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInterceptor; import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInvocation;  public class AnimalAdvice implements MethodInterceptor {  public Object invoke MethodInvocation invocation  throws Throwable   Logger log = Logger.getLogger Constants.LOG_NAME ; StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder  ; sb.append "Target Class:" .append invocation.getThis   .    {       append "\n" .append                           Object retVal = invocation.proceed  ;  invocation.getMethod   .append "\n" ;  [ 103 ]   Spring AOP Proxies        }          }  sb.append " return value:" .append retVal .append "\n" ; log.info sb.toString   ; return retVal;  The configuration file applicationContext.xml:  <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"  xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd">  <bean id="tiger" class="org.springaop.chapter.three.autoproxy.    domain.Cat">                            <bean id="albatross" class="org.springaop.chapter.three.autoproxy.    domain.Seabird">              <bean id="methodNamePointcut" class="org.springframework.aop.      support.NameMatchMethodPointcut">                                                      has*   get*     <bean id="animalAdvice" class="org.springaop.chapter.three.      autoproxy.AnimalAdvice" >    <bean id="animalAdvisor" class="org.springframework.aop.support.

AutoProxyCreator with metadata This autoproxy option concerns the possibility of employing annotations in the  classes, for example to define transactions.  In order to be able to employ this type of configuration, we have to use  DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator, a CommonsAttributes bean that interprets  source-level metadata, and another bean that employs those attributes.  In order to employ the CommosAttributes bean, we must have in the classpath the   akarta library Commons Attributes  http:  commons.apache.org attributes .  <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"  xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd">  [ 108 ]   Chapter 3  …  <bean id="autoProxyCreator" class="org.springframework.aop.framework. autoproxy.DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator" >  <bean id="advisor" class="org.springframework.transaction.    interceptor.TransactionAttributeSourceAdvisor">   rceptor"  >         <property name="transactionInterceptor" ref="transactionInte  <property name="transactionManager" ref="transactionManager"   <bean id="transactionInterceptor" class="org.springframework.                 transaction.interceptor.TransactionInterceptor">    >     interceptor.AttributesTransactionAttributeSource">   ref="metadataAttributes"  >        <property name="attributes"                           <bean class="org.springframework.transaction.  <bean id="metadataAttributes" class="org.springframework.metadata.    commons.CommonsAttributes"  >  <bean name="transactionManager" class="org.springframework.jdbc.    datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager">                 The autoProxyCreator bean creates proxies according to what advisors in the  application context indicate to it, or the advices to apply and the pointcuts at which  apply them.

Now  we're going to see a short introduction on proxies with Aspect . We will have a full  overview of their use in the chapter AspectJ support. The use of Aspect  can be connected to two typologies: through code annotations or  through XML Schema. Here are the rules that define which beans are excluded from  the autoproxy:     Proxy is not applied to beans that implement the interfaces  BeanPostProcessor or BeanFactoryPostProcessor.  The class AnnotationAwareAspectJAutoProxyCreator implements the  interface BeanPostProcessor, which allows the class to modify the life cycle  of beans on which a proxy must be created and applied.  [ 110 ]   Chapter 3     Classes with annotations @AspectJ and classes that implement or extend any  other AOP component are excluded from the autoproxy. This is because they  aren't target classes, and they perform tasks in Spring AOP infrastructure.  Apart from the beans that belong to these two cases, the others can be subject to  proxy auto-creation. This is so if they are subject to aspects and advisors with the  matching rules defined in pointcuts that are defined in the applicationContext.  Autoproxy with annotation If we use annotations, we will tell Spring that proxies must be created according   to them:  <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"  xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd">     <bean class="org.springframework.aop.aspectj.annotation.    AnnotationAwareAspectJAutoProxyCreator" >      …  AnnotationAwareAspectJAutoProxyCreator must be declared only one time. It's  used by Spring to configure all the classes that have the annotation @Aspect, in order  to create the proxy for the annotated class and return it for the execution of advices  when a pointcut is matched.  Autoproxy with XML Schema If we want automatic generation of proxies, we will use the tag <aop:aspectj- autoproxy > through the AOP namespaces. This tag too must be used one time.  But in case of error, beans' proxies will be created only once, whereas if we declare  AnnotationAwareAspectJAutoProxyCreator at several points in beans, we'll have  the proxies created several times. The effect is anyway identical to the use of the bean  AnnotationAwareAspectJAutoProxyCreator.    <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:aop="http:  www.springframework.org schema aop" xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd http:  www.springframework.org schema aop   [ 111 ]   Spring AOP Proxies  http:  www.springframework.org schema aop spring-aop-2.5.xsd"> …          …  If we want to force the use of CGLIB proxies, we will modify the tag   aspectj-autoproxy in this way:    <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:aop="http:  www.springframework.org schema aop" xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd http:  www.springframework.org schema aop  http:  www.springframework.org schema aop spring-aop-2.5.xsd">           …    Target sources Until now, we have used the word "target" to define the object that receives the calls  from a caller object, where a proxy was interposed to add logic contained in advices.   In this interposition mechanism, Spring puts at our disposal the interface org. springframework.aop.TargetSource, which returns the object target.  public interface TargetSource {  Class getTargetClass  ;  boolean isStatic  ;  Object getTarget   throws Exception;  void releaseTarget Object target  throws Exception; }  This interface is interesting as it permits target pooling and hot swapping.  [ 112 ]   Chapter 3  Without specifying the targetSource, the default implementation that   wraps the local object is returned and also the target is returned for all the   following invocations.  Hot swappable target sources The target source org.springframework.aop.target.HotSwappableTargetSource  allows a proxy's target object to be replaced in a ThreadSafe way with immediate  effect, and the caller doesn't lose the reference.   To make the change, the method swap   is called.  Example interface:  package org.springaop.chapter.three.autoproxy.domain;  public interface Animal {  public Integer getNumberPaws  ;  Implementing class:  package org.springaop.chapter.three.autoproxy.domain;  public class AnimalImpl implements Animal{  public Integer getNumberPaws   {   }  return paws;  public void setPaws Integer paws  {   }  this.paws = paws;  private Integer paws;  ApplicationContext.xml, which contains three AnimalImpl, one swappable bean,  and one ProxyFactoryBean:  <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"  xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd">  <bean id="animal1" class="org.springaop.chapter.three.autoproxy.    domain.AnimalImpl">             [ 113 ]       }                              }         Spring AOP Proxies  <bean id="animal2" class="org.springaop.chapter.three.autoproxy. domain.AnimalImpl">             <bean id="animal3" class="org.springaop.chapter.three.autoproxy. domain.AnimalImpl">              HotSwappableTargetSource">      <bean id="swapper" class="org.springframework.aop.target.            <bean id="swappable" class="org.springframework.aop.framework.    <              ProxyFactoryBean">   property>             The test class:  package org.springaop.chapter.three.targetsource.swap;  import org.springaop.targetsources.domain.Animal; import org.springframework.aop.target.HotSwappableTargetSource; import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext; import org.springframework.context.support.

But the target object must be prototype, and this is because  the PoolingTargetSource creates a new instance of the target object every time   it's necessary.  If we need it, we can have information about the pool and can tell Spring to cast the  pool objects with org.springframework.aop.target.PoolingConfig.  Example:  <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"  xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd">  <bean id="animalTarget" class="org.springaop.chapter.three.autoproxy. domain.AnimalImpl" scope="prototype">            [ 115 ]   <bean id="poolTargetSource" class="org.springframework.aop.target.       <bean id="animal" class="org.springframework.aop.framework.

We have to consider the fact that if the creation of new objects is not  wasteful, then the wiring of every object in the applicationContext could   be wasteful.  Unless we have particular needs, this type of targetSource is inadvisable.  <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"  xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd">  <bean id="animalTargetObject" class="org.springaop.chapter.three. autoproxy.domain.AnimalImpl" scope="prototype" >             <bean id="animalObject" class="org.springframework.aop.framework.  <property name="targetSource" ref="prototypeAnimalTargetSour    ProxyFactoryBean">     ce" >       <bean id="prototypeAnimalTargetSource" class="org.springframework.       aop.target.PrototypeTargetSource">     …         [ 116 ]   Chapter 3  ThreadLocal target source A ThreadLocal target source is indicated when we need to have an object for each  request  that is, per thread . The concept of a ThreadLocal provides a  DK-wide  facility to transparently store resources alongside a thread.   With this type of targetSource we have to pay attention to problems that can arise,  such as memory leaks. It would be appropriate to wrap the ThreadLocal and never  use it directly, and to set and remove resources properly from the thread. Spring  provides support for the ThreadLocal, and its use should be favored.  …  <bean id="animalTargetThreadObject" class="org.springaop.chapter.  <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"  xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd">       three.autoproxy.domain.AnimalImpl" scope="prototype">                    target.ThreadLocalTargetSource">   ect" >   …      <bean id="threadlocalTargetSource" class="org.springframework.aop.  <property name="targetBeanName" value="animalTargetThreadObj        Summary In this chapter we have seen the important role of proxies on which all Spring AOP  is based. We have seen how to use proxies in a programmatic way and with several  implementations   DK and CGLIB . We have seen how ProxyFactoryBean simplifies  and masks the work of proxies' creation and preparation. Then we saw how to  reduce the configuration with the features provided by Spring for the automatic  creation of beans with three types of autoproxy. Towards the end of the chapter   we glanced at how Spring allows us to act on advised objects and target sources,   to enable us to do advanced operations in our code.  [ 117 ]    AspectJ Support  In this chapter, we will see how Aspect  facilitates Spring AOP. We will particularly  focus on syntax for pointcuts and the possibility of using IoC on domain objects:  either the definition is applied to the hierarchies of objects  context bindings , or  pointcuts are applied on the names of Spring beans. We will see how aspects are set  up in complex contexts to avoid conflicts, and which advanced functionalities are  allowed  annotations on annotations . The possibility of using Aspect  syntax means  that we can define the rules on which aspects can be applied through pointcuts in a  better way. There are two modalities to use Aspect 's features with Spring: by means  of annotations and XML configuration.   AspectJ annotations The annotations introduced in  ava 5 allow us to add features in a very simple way.  In our context, they allow us to define aspects and other AOP components already  seen in this book, by means of annotations.  The power of this functionality lies in allowing the definition of aspect, pointcut,  and advice directly on  ava classes with features provided by Aspect . One doesn't  have to put up with inconveniences such as the alteration of bytecode required by a  solution based only on Aspect .  To put the AOP components together, a proxy is created  autoproxy  on the beans on  which annotations have been defined.   In SpringAOP, an aspect can't be a target of another aspect.   AspectJ Support  Annotation: To use Aspect  as shown below, there must be the two  ARs in the  classpath: aspectjweaver.jar and aspectjrt.jar. They are available in the lib aspectj folder in the distribution   Spring-with-dependencies, or in the lib folder of the installation of  Aspect   1.5.x or upwards .  Aspect An aspect is a normal  ava class with the annotation @Aspect, and also a   Spring bean.  import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;  @Aspect public class AspectJAnnotatedExample { … }  Like any other class, it can have methods and fields, and can contain pointcuts,  advices, and introductions.  To tell Spring that it must create autoproxies for the classes that are noted in the  configuration, we have to write:    <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"  xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd">   <bean class="org.springframework.aop.aspectj.annotation. AnnotationAwareAspectJAutoProxyCreator" > ...    If we want to use AOP namespaces, we have to write:    <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:aop="http:  www.springframework.org schema aop" xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd  [ 120 ]   http:  www.springframework.org schema aop  http:  www.springframework.org schema aop spring-aop-2.5.xsd">  Chapter 4        Pointcut In the previous chapters, we said that Spring AOP uses the execution of the methods  on Spring beans as a pointcut.  The declaration of a pointcut is composed of two parts: a signature with parameters,  and the expression that determines exactly the method execution that must be  intercepted by the pointcut.  By annotating methods, it's possible to indicate at which points of the execution flow   in the Aspect class  the advices must be applied with their additional logic.   package org.springaop.chapter.four.pointcut;  import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect; import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;  @Aspect public class AspectJAnnotatedExample {    …  @Before "execution * insert ..  "  public void fooMethod  {  }  As I have said several times, Spring AOP provides fewer pointcuts compared  to Aspect  in order to simplify the use of Aspect-Oriented Programming. The  expressions that can be defined in methods that function as advice, as in the case of  the before method in the example, are the expressions to designate pointcuts. They  are indicated as Pointcut Designators  PCD . With Spring AOP, PCD that acts with the execution of methods as joinpoints are  available. They are:  execution  within   this  [ 121 ]         …  }          AspectJ Support                 target args @target @args @within @annotation  bean  Moreover, we have the possibility of indicating a Spring bean that acts at instance  level, and is available only with Spring AOP and not with Aspect .  target and args are more commonly used in the binding form. @target, @within,   @annotation and @args can also be used in the binding form.  We will explain the binding form later in this chapter.  The wildcard characters that can be used in the definition of pointcut designators are:    *, &&  AND ,   OR , !  negated , and +, which indicates the hierarchy of the object  to which it is applied.  Let's see the role of each PCD.  execution This PCD is used to define the execution of methods as joinpoints. This is the main  pointcut designator used.  within  This limits the matching of joinpoints to the execution from within some types   of classes.  this This limits matching to joinpoints where the bean reference  Spring AOP proxy  is an  instance of the given type.  target This limits matching to joinpoints where the target object  application object being  proxied  is an instance of the given type.  [ 122 ]   Chapter 4  args This limits matching to joinpoints  the execution of methods when using Spring  AOP  where the arguments are instances of the given types.   @target This limits matching to joinpoints where the class of the executing object has an  annotation of the given type.  @args This limits matching to joinpoints where the runtime type of the actual arguments  passed has annotations of the given type s .  @ within  This limits matching to joinpoints within types that have the given annotation  the  execution of methods declared in types with the given annotation when using   Spring AOP .  @ annotation This limits matching to joinpoints where the subject of the joinpoint has the   given annotation.  bean  The form to define the execution of a bean is bean idOrNameOfBean . This pointcut  designator acts only at instance level, rather than at type level, since Spring 2.5.  This pointcut is only supported in XML-based Spring AOP configurations, and not in  Aspect  annotations.  The following of Aspect 's PCD are not available in Spring: their use causes an  IllegalArgumentException:             call  get  set  preinitialization  staticinitialization   [ 123 ]   AspectJ Support                     initialization handler  adviceexecution  withincode  cflow  cflowbelow  if  @this  @withincode  The advantage of defining a poincut rather than the type of advice in methods'  annotation is having the possibility of reusing pointcuts in the aspects and  combining them to compose more complex rules.  If the pointcut used in the aspect is not located in the same class, you have  to include the package name also.  Now let's declare them:  package org.springaop.chapter.four.pointcut;  import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect; import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Pointcut;  @Aspect public class ApplicationPointcutsAspect {  @Pointcut "execution  public * * ..  "  public void allPublicMethod  {}  @Pointcut "within org.springaop.web..* "  public void inWebLayer  {}  @Pointcut "within org.springaop.service..* "  public void inServiceLayer  {}  @Pointcut "within org.springaop.dao..* "  public void inResourceLayer  {}                        "    }  [ 124 ]  @Pointcut "inWebLayer   && inServiceLayer   && inResourceLayer     public void inAllLayers  {}   Chapter 4  The @Pointcut must be declared within a class annotated with @Aspect.  In the method allPublicMethod, the matching is declared on the execution of   public methods.  Its body is empty. This method is in fact not called, but is used just to define   a pointcut.  Once pointcuts have been defined, it is possible to use them in the annotations   with advices.  package org.springaop.chapter.four.pointcut;  import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect; import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;  @Aspect public class FooAspect {  @Before  "org.springaop.chapter.four.pointcut.    ApplicationPointcutsAspect.inResourceLayer  "       public void beforeFooMethods  {            do something      }  }    }  In class FooAspect, a pointcut defined in class ApplicationPointcutsAspect was  used with a before advice.  Let's see the formal syntax of a pointcut execution as an example:  execution modifiers-pattern? ret-type-pattern declaring-type-pattern?  name-pattern param-pattern  throws-pattern?  All the fields apart from ret-type-pattern, that is the return-type pattern,   name-pattern  method name , and param-pattern  name and type of parameters   are optional  indicated with the "?"   Usable patterns include the wildcard characters as well.  The asterisk  *  indicates any type, and can be used as a wildcard even in a fully  qualified type name.  Empty brackets    indicate a method without parameters, whereas brackets  containing two dots  ..  indicate any number of parameters  even no parameters .  [ 125 ]   An asterisk between brackets  *  means just a parameter of any type.  AspectJ Support  Let's see some examples.  execution public * * ..    In this case, the modifiers-pattern is public, and therefore it refers to   public methods.  The "*"  asterisk  means "any value": applied to the method's return type and name   declaring-type-pattern  it matches with a public method with any return type  and with any name. For the name-pattern there is an *, which matches a method  with any name, and the  param-pattern  is  ..  so any number of parameters   is allowed.  In this example, this pointcut designator will match any public method in   any package.  execution * set* ..    This pointcut intercepts the execution of any type of method  public, protected ,  whose name starts with "set" and accepts any number and type of parameters.  execution * org.springaop.service.Example.* ..    This pointcut intercepts the execution of methods with any visibility  public ,  protected, private, default  that are contained in the Example class in the   org.springaop.service package and accept any type and number of parameters.   execution * org.springaop.service.*.* ..    This pointcut intercepts the execution of methods with any visibility  public,  protected  and name that are contained in the package org.springaop.service   and accept any type and number of parameters.   execution * org.springaop.service..*.* ..    This pointcut intercepts the execution of methods with any visibility  public,  protected, private, default  and name that are contained in the package   org.springaop.service or in its subpackages and accept any type and number   of parameters.  within org.springaop.service..*   This pointcut intercepts the execution of any method into the package or  subpackages of org.springaop.service.  within org.springaop.service.*   [ 126 ]   This pointcut intercepts the execution of any method into the package   org.springaop.service.  Chapter 4  Pointcuts equivalent: execution *org.springaop.service.ExampleService.* ..   within org.springaop.service.ExampleService   this org.springaop.service.ExampleService   This pointcut intercepts any method where the proxy implements the  ExampleService interface.  target org.springaop.service.ExampleService   This pointcut intercepts the execution of any method where the target object  implements the ExampleService interface.  args java.lang.String   This pointcut intercepts the execution of any method where at runtime a parameter  is String type.  args *, java.lang.String   This pointcut intercepts the execution of any method where at runtime the first  parameter is of any type, and the second parameter is String type.  The difference between args java.lang.String   and execution * *  java.lang.String   is that in the first case we consider the String type argument a runtime,  whereas the second one is String type in the method's declaration.  @target org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional   This pointcut intercepts the execution of any method where the target object has the  @Transactional annotation.  @args org.company.Classified   [ 127 ]   AspectJ Support  This pointcut intercepts the execution of any method where, at runtime, a parameter  has the @Classified annotation.  This pointcut intercepts any joinpoint on the bean called magicbox.ehCache.  bean magicbox.ehCache   bean magicbox.*   This pointcut intercepts any joinpoint on the beans with a name starting   with magicbox.  execution public * * ..   throws java.lang.IOException  This pointcut intercepts the execution of public methods with any name, which   return anything, accept any number and type of parameters, and have throws java. lang.IOException in the declaration.  within org.company.domain.Example+   This pointcut intercepts methods coming from examples or classes belonging to its  own hierarchy, that is, of the same type.  After looking at these short introductory examples, we can logically collect the types  of pointcut designators on the strength of general groupings.               Selection on methods' names  Selection on types of argument Selection on types of return Selection on declared exceptions Selection on hierarchy Selection on annotations  Selection on methods' names Using wildcards, it is possible to compose pointcuts using the names of methods.  @Aspect public class ApplicationPointcutsAspect { ... @Pointcut "execution * swim* ..    execution * play* ..     execution * run ..  "    … }  public void goodTimesOnTheBeach   {}  [ 128 ]   In this case, we are joining with logical OR the executions of methods whose name  starts with swim, play, or run. The result is that the advice intercepts the execution   of each of the three methods.  Chapter 4  Selection on types of argument We can compose several pointcuts using the arguments of the declarations of  methods  opposite to args, which uses the values of arguments at runtime .  Let's see some pointcuts with names that explain their function:  package org.springaop.chapter.four.pointcut; ... @Aspect public class ApplicationPointcutsAspect { ...  @Pointcut "execution * *   "  public void allMethodsWithoutArguments   {}  @Pointcut "execution * * ..  "  public void allMethodsWithOneOrMoreArgumentRegarlessOfType   {}  @Pointcut "execution * * java.lang.Integer, java.lang.String  "  public void allMethodsWithTwoArgumentFirstIntegerSecondString   {}  @Pointcut "execution * * java.lang.Integer,..  "  public void  allMethodsWithFirstArgumentOfTypeIntegerAndZeroOrMoreOtherArguments    {}  public void     @Pointcut "execution * * *,java.lang.Integer,..  "    allMethodsWithSecondArgumentOfTypeIntegerAndZeroOrMoreOtherArguments     {}  @Pointcut "args java.util.Hashtable "  public void allMethodsWithHashtableInsteadOfMap   {}                           ... }  [ 129 ]   AspectJ Support  Selection on type of return Let's see some pointcuts with names that explain their functions:  package org.springaop.chapter.four.pointcut;  @Aspect public class ApplicationPointcutsAspect { ...            @Pointcut "execution  * get* ..  "  public void methodsWithAllReturnType   {}  @Pointcut "execution  java.lang.Integer get* ..  "  public void getterMethodsWithIntegerReturnType   {}  @Pointcut "execution  void set* ..  "  public void setterMethods   {}                      ... }  Selection on declared exceptions Declared exceptions are supposed to be CheckedException.  Let's see some pointcuts with names that explain their function:  package org.springaop.chapter.four.pointcut;  @Aspect public class ApplicationPointcutsAspect { ...      @Pointcut "execution  * * ..  throws java.lang.IOException "  public void methodsThatThrowsIoExceptions   {}  @Pointcut "execution  * * ..  throws  java.lang. IllegalThreadStateException "  public void  methodsThatThrowsIllegalThreadStateException   {} ... }  Selection on hierarchy In this case, it is necessary to select the classes of a hierarchy  subtype pattern .  execution * com.company.Product+.* ..    or:   within com.company.Product+   [ 130 ]   Chapter 4  Selection on annotations Let's define an annotation:   package org.springaop.chapter.four.pointcut.annotation;  import java.lang.annotation.Retention; import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;  @Retention RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME  public @interface SensitiveOperation {  }  Then we can use it:  package org.springaop.chapter.four.pointcut.annotation;  public class OnLineBanking {  @SensitiveOperation public boolean addMoney Integer amount {   }          } package org.springaop.chapter.four.pointcut;  …  @Aspect public class ApplicationPointcutsAspect { ...   annotation.SensitiveOperation "    … }  It is now possible to use it in an advice like this:  @Pointcut "@annotation  org.springaop.chapter.four.pointcut.  public void methodsWithSensitiveOperationAnnotation  {}  @Before "org.springaop.chapter.four.pointcut. ApplicationPointcutsAspect.methodsWithSensitiveOperationAnnotation    "  public void methodsWithSensitiveOperationAnnotation   {}  or:  @Pointcut "@within org.springaop.chapter.four.pointcut.annotation. SensitiveOperation "  public void methodsWithSensitiveOperationAnnotation   {}  [ 131 ]   AspectJ Support  Binding advice arguments We can add arguments to advice methods and bind any argument value, exception,  return value, or annotation.   JoinPoint Advices can use a joinpoint implementation that contains information about the  entering arguments  getArgs   , about the method on which the advice must be  applied  being advised   getSignature   , about the proxy object  getThis   ,  or about the target object  getTarget   . In around advices, the joinpoint's  implementation is the ProceedingJoinPoint.  In advices, JoinPoint  if present  must be the first argument passed.  Binding arguments While using joinpoints, it may be necessary to read and to use arguments' methods  with before advices, above all in order to limit the matching of methods that can be  invoked simply with the execution.   Arguments can be obtained through JoinPoint, recovering them from the array of  objects that is passed, and casting it.  @Before "execution * set* ..  "    public void foo JoinPoint jp {          }  Object[] args = jp.getArgs  ;  or even defining args on the static match that is made with the execution.  In this way, Spring AOP binds a method's parameters, which must match.   @Before "execution * set* ..   && args param,.. "   public void foo String param {   }  ...  Parameters' binding in invocations is based on names contained in joinpoints, but  not with reflection. SpringAOP uses the following strategy.  [ 132 ]   Chapter 4  If the arguments' names are present, they are used:  @Before "execution * set* ..  && args name, surname  "  public void foo String name, String surname {   }    do something  If JoinPoint is present too, both of them are used. But it's convenient to use  JoinPoint if there is no other information available.  If there aren't arguments' names, Spring AOP recovers the information from the  debug information, that can have been set at the time of compilation if the flag  '-g: vars'  has been set.   If the latter has NOT been set, Spring tries to deduce the binding matching variable  with the parameter. If there were ambiguities that Spring could not resolve, an  AmbiguousBindingException would be thrown.  If none of the previous points work, an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.  When declaring an independent pointcut that exposes parameters, you  have to include it in the argument list of the pointcut method as well.  Binding of return values Binding of return values can be useful with AfterReturning advices; you can assign  a name to the return value  with returning  that is the name of the argument to be  used in the advice.  @AfterReturning value = "execution com.company.service.*Service     get ..  ", returning = "output"         public void interceptOutputParam String output  {   }  ...  Exception binding  Exception binding is used with an AfterThrowing advice; the throwing property  specifies the argument name to be used in the advice.  @AfterThrowing value = "execution * startMatch ..  throws java.lang. IOException ", throwing = "ioex"  public void interceptIOException IOException ioex  {   }  ..   [ 133 ]   AspectJ Support Annotation binding  Annotations that compose the compiled class can be used to bind information they  contain. Two cases are possible: annotation on methods or on classes.  If we define an annotation that has a value, this value can be bound.  package org.springaop.chapter.four.pointcut.annotation;  import java.lang.annotation.Retention; import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;  @Retention RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME  public @interface SensitiveOperation {  String value   default "secret";    }  In this way, the value given in the annotation-sensitive operation can be bound and  passed to the method on which the pointcut is defined.  @Pointcut "@annotation operation "     public void methodsForAccounting SensitiveOperation operation {}  In case of annotation on class:  @SensitiveOperation value="superSecret"  public class OnLineBanking {…}  the pointcut uses within, which works in a static manner at the level of class, using  information obtained from the method's signature at the time of proxy creation.  @Pointcut "@within operation "     public void bankingMethods SensitiveOperation operation  {}  Advice An advice is the logic part that is executed when a joinpoint's matching is done.  It's simply the action at the point indicated by the joinpoint during the execution of   the application.  In the previous paragraph, we saw with several examples all the ways to define a  pointcut. In the first two chapters, we saw the classic part of Spring AOP present  since 1.x version, where advices were defined at the level of interfaces to   be implemented.  [ 134 ]   Chapter 4  In this section, we will see how advices are defined by normal methods. The  difference is in annotations that declare for which use and in which context those  methods must be used inside a class. This is also annotated too so that it is treated   as aspect.  Advices must always be defined with annotations within a class annotated with   @Aspect. So, we will have a regular  ava class with the annotation @Aspect above   the definition of the class, and public methods with annotations indicated in the  following list. This indicates that those methods are eligible to be used as advice and  can be applied according to the rules present and points indicated in the annotation.   An aspect can contain any number of advices.  package org.springaop.chapter.four;  import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect; import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;  @Aspect public class AspectAdvicesExamples {  public void controlAccessCheck  {      @Before "execution  org.springaop.service.AccessOperation.* ..  "              } … }  ...  Advices must be defined within a class annotated with @Aspect.  As we said in earlier chapters, advices can be of different types, but in this case they  are formed with the annotations:  @Before @AfterReturning @AfterThrowing @After  After Finally  @Around  [ 135 ]   AspectJ Support  Let's describe them in detail:  @Before Before advice allows us to perform actions before the proxy does the call on the  target object  thus, before the joinpoint's execution . The annotated method returns  nothing, so the signature will be public void.   In the before annotation, we will have to indicate the pointcut that tells Spring where  to apply it  bean, package class, and so on .  This advice doesn't forestall the continuation of processing, unless an exception   is thrown.  package org.springaop.chapter.four;  @Aspect public class AspectAdvicesExamples {  ... @Before "execution * org.springaop.service.AccessOperation.* ..  "              }  public void controlAccessCheck  {  ...  ... }  In this case, we are declaring that we want the content of method  ControlAccessCheck to be executed when any method is called on the  AccessOperation class; or, even better, using pointcut designators:  package org.springaop.chapter.four;  @Aspect public class AspectAdvicesExamples {  public void controlAccessCheck  {  ... @Before "execution * org.springaop.app.services.*.* ..  "              } ... }  ...  [ 136 ]   @AfterReturning The after returning advice is executed once the method on which we are applying  the advice has finished its execution normally  no exception thrown .  Even in this case, a public method must be annotated within a class that is annotated   as @Aspect.  Chapter 4  package org.springaop.chapter.four;  @Aspect public class AspectAdvicesExamples {  public void logOperationCommited  {  ...        @AfterReturning "execution * org.springaop.service.*.* ..  "              } ... }  If we want to have the return value of the method to use in the advice, we have to  bind it. So we will write :  package org.springaop.chapter.four;  @Aspect public class AspectAdvicesExamples {  ...     public void logOperationPerformed Object returningValue {    @AfterReturning pointcut="execution  * org.springaop.service.*.* ..  ", returning="returningValue"              } ... }  …  The type of value for which the bind is done is given in the advice. Putting object as  the type of the return, we are sure that any type of object will fit. Naturally, it's not  possible to return another object different from the one returned by the method on  which the advice is applied.  [ 137 ]   AspectJ Support @AfterThrowing The after throwing advice is applied when a method's execution ends with the  throwing of an exception.  It is defined by declaring the annotation @AfterThrowing on a method within a class  annotated with @Aspect:  package org.springaop.chapter.four;  @Aspect public class AspectAdvicesExamples { … @AfterThrowing "execution * org.springaop.service.*.* ..  "        ... } }  public void doRecoveryActionsOnDataAccessException  {  Or using the pointcut designators, you can make the exception object available to   the advice.  package org.springaop.chapter.four;  @Aspect public class AspectAdvicesExamples {      @AfterThrowing pointcut="execution  * org.springaop.service.*.* ..  ", throwing="ex"      public void doRecoveryActionsOnDataAccessException DataAccessExce ption ex { … }  …  }  As usual, the name used in the annotation's throwing has to be the same as the  advice's parameter one.  The advice's parameter narrows down the type of exception that can be thrown.      @After The after  finally  advice is executed after the execution of the method on which the  pointcut's matching is performed. The advice is executed in any case, that is whether  an exception is thrown or not.   [ 138 ]   Chapter 4  It is defined by the annotation @After on a method within a class annotated   with @Aspect.   This advice wasn't present in Spring 1.x and in the configurations we  called "classic".  package org.springaop.chapter.four;  @Aspect public class AspectAdvicesExamples {      @After "execution  * org.springaop.service.*.* ..  "      public void releaseResource  {  In this type of advice we don't have any type of specific binding, except for the one  that we could have using a pointcut designator with argNames.  @Around The around advice presents some peculiarities compared with the ones we've  previously seen, and it is the most complicated to use as well because it wasn't  designed for a specific action. Before using it, it is recommended to verify if the  requirements can be satisfied by another type of advice which is less powerful   than this one.   This advice has full control over the method to be called, both before and after the  invocation, and it can even decide not to invoke it.   The aim with which it is most often used is sharing state in a thread-safe manner  before and after the invocation of the method.  The advice has a return value, unlike the others, which return void. The advice has as first type of parameter org.aspectj.lang. ProceedingJoinPoint. The advice declares in the signature throws Throwable.      } }          …  package org.springaop.chapter.four;  @Aspect public class AspectAdvicesExamples {      @Around "execution * startMatch ..  "   [ 139 ]   AspectJ Support      public Object doTimeProfiling ProceedingJoinPoint pjp  throws  Throwable{                             } … }     start stopwatch Object retVal = pjp.proceed  ;    stop stopwatch return retVal;  The first parameter has to be an object of the type ProceedingJoinPoint.  ProceedingJoinPoint contains parameters in an array of objects, the target object,  the proxy object, and all the other pieces of information of the execution context.  In order to invoke the method on the target object, you need to call the method  proceed   on ProceedingJoinPoint .  Depending on requirements the method proceed   can be invoked one or   more times or not be invoked at all.  Introduction An introduction is defined by the annotation @DeclareParents, and indicates  that the type of class used for the matching has a new parent that will be the  implementation of a new interface. Below it is used to declare the Matter and  GeometricForm interfaces.  package org.springaop.chapter.four.introduction;    import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;  import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.DeclareParents;    @Aspect  public class ParallelepipedIntroduction {        @DeclareParents value = "org.springaop.chapter.four.introduction. Box",               defaultImpl = Titanium.class       public Matter matter;   [ 140 ]   Chapter 4      @DeclareParents value = "org.springaop.chapter.four.introduction. Box",               defaultImpl = Cube.class       public GeometricForm geometricForm;     }  In this way, we have a chance to define interfaces  Matter and GeometricForm  and  provide implementations  Titanium and Cube  to apply them on the target classes  detected by joinpoints.  The test class:  package org.springaop.chapter.four.introduction;  import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext; import org.springframework.context.support. ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;   * run with jvm argument: -javaagent:  spring-agent.jar *  public class TestIntroduction {     public static void main String[] args  {           String[] paths = {"org springaop chapter four introduction  applicationContext.xml"};           ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext  paths ;            Box bean =  Box ctx.getBean "box" ;           System.out.println bean.getName   ;            Matter beanMatter =  Matter  bean;           System.out.println beanMatter.getType   ;            GeometricForm geoMetricBean =  GeometricForm  bean;           System.out.println geoMetricBean.getShape   ;    } }  [ 141 ]   AspectJ Support  The configuration in eclipse for spring-agent.jar:  The output will be:  [ 142 ]   Chapter 4  XML Schema-based configuration Now we are going to see SpringAOP configuration using XML configuration.   The choice to use XML instead of annotations, beyond personal preferences, is the  only practicable one in contexts where we use JDK previous to 1.5; it is the first JDK  version in which annotations have been introduced.  Therefore, if you want to use Spring with  DK 1.3 or 1.4, the use of schema-based  configuration is mandatory.  The only supported instantiation model for XML-defined aspects is the   Singleton model.  In order to use XML tags and namespaces instead of annotations, we have to import:    <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:aop="http:  www.springframework.org schema aop" xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd http:  www.springframework.org schema aop  http:  www.springframework.org schema aop spring-aop-2.5.xsd"> …     While using annotations, the class annotated with @Aspect acts as a container of  advices and pointcuts; with XML configuration advices and pointcuts are declared  inside the tag:  An aspect equivalent to a class annotated with @Aspect is indicated with:         An advisor is configured with:     A pointcut is configured with:     [ 143 ]  It enables the link between an Aspect  pointcut and a classic SpringAOP   advice object.   AspectJ Support  The tag   heavily uses the Spring autoproxy  mechanism. Therefore, there could be some problems if Spring  was configured to explicitly use per this autoproxying with the  BeanNameAutoProxyCreator.  Aspect An aspect in the case of XML schema configuration can be any other bean defined in  the application context.    <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:aop="http:  www.springframework.org schema aop" xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd http:  www.springframework.org schema aop  http:  www.springframework.org schema aop spring-aop-2.5.xsd">      <bean id="exampleBean class="org.springaop.schemabased.

That is, you can't use a pointcut in an  annotation identified by its ID in the XML file.   An action you can perform is defining the pointcut directly inside the tag    , with the advantage of the chance of the binding of parameters   as we have seen with annotations.    <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:aop="http:  www.springframework.org schema aop" xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd http:  www.springframework.org schema aop  http:  www.springframework.org schema aop spring-aop-2.5.xsd">  [ 145 ]   AspectJ Support         <aop:pointcut expression="execution * org.springaop.pointcuts.*.* ..   && this service " id="pointcutServices" >           Of course, the advice has to declare to receive the pieces of information from the  joinpoint's context:  public void foo Object fooService  { ... }  In situations where more expressions must be combined, the symbols OR     ,  AND   &&  , and NEGATION   !   can be substituted by or, and, and not.  Advice The advices that were used in the annotations can be used here as well.  Before advice The function is the same as when using annotations—executing some logic before  the target class.  With XML, you declare it in this manner:     <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans"  xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"  xmlns:aop="http:  www.springframework.org schema aop"  xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans   http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd"  http:  www.springframework.org schema aop   http:  www.springframework.org schema aop spring-aop-2.5.xsd>                      <aop:pointcut expression="execution * org.springaop. pointcuts.*.* ..  && this service " id="pointcutServices" >                                  <aop:before pointcut-ref="pointcutServices"   [ 146 ]   Chapter 4  method="foo" >                          The pointcut's syntax declares the type, in this case before, of the pointcut to which  we should refer for the matching rules, and the name of the method containing the  advice's body, or defining inline the matching rule.     <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans"  xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"  xmlns:aop="http:  www.springframework.org schema aop"  xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans   http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd  http:  www.springframework.org schema aop   http:  www.springframework.org schema aop spring-aop-2.5.xsd">                                            <aop:before method="trace"                   pointcut="execution  * org.springaop.chapter.four. schema.*.* ..

Introduction As I said before in this chapter, introductions allow declaring that a target object  implements interfaces, providing the implementation.  [ 151 ]   AspectJ Support  To allow the building of introductions, we declare the tag    within the tag    aop:aspect> using the same example code as for annotations:     <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans"  xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans   http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd  http:  www.springframework.org schema aop   http:  www.springframework.org schema aop spring-aop-2.5.xsd">                                  <aop:declare-parents                   types-matching= "org.springaop.chapter.four.schema.introduction."*                  implement-interface= "org.springaop.chapter.four.schema.introduction.CounterTracker"                   default-impl= "org.springaop.chapter.four.schema.introduction.CounterTrackerImpl" >                <aop:after pointcut="execution * org.springaop.chapter. four.schema.introduction.*.* ..   and this counter "                  method="increase"  >                          <bean id="counterIntroduction" class="org.springaop.chapter.four. schema.introduction.CounterIntroduction"  >        <bean id="cube" class="org.springaop.chapter.four.schema. introduction.Cube"  >        <bean id=titanium class="org.springaop.chapter.four.schema. introduction.Titanium"  >     types-matching is the usual pattern for matching with Aspect . implement- interface indicates the interface to be implemented, and default-impl indicates  the implementation of the interface to be used.  The class of bean counterIntroduction will contain the call to the method  increaseCounter, defined in interface CounterTracker.  public class CounterIntroduction {        public void increase CounterTracker counter {           counter.increaseCounter  ;    } }  [ 152 ]   Chapter 4  Advisors As I explained, in the classic part of Spring AOP, advisors are useful for joining  together the aspect and advice. They are a typical construction of Spring, not   of Aspect .  Using annotations advisors aren't present, whereas with XML schema they can be  used with the tag  . The most common use is with the advice for  transactions  .    <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:aop="http:  www.springframework.org schema aop" xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd http:  www.springframework.org schema aop  http:  www.springframework.org schema aop spring-aop-2.5.xsd">     ...  <aop:pointcut id="pointcutServices" expression="execution *   <aop:advisor pointcut-ref="pointcutServices"                     org.springaop.pointcuts.*.* ..  && this service " >   order="1" advice-ref="tx-advice" >                                              Recipes Let's see some recipes on how to use AOP with the domain object to solve the  concurrency of aspects and the mixin of configurations.  Dependency injection in domain objects  Spring instantiates and configures beans contained in application context  configuration files. If you use Domain-Driven Design, you can ask a bean factory   to configure your domain object.  [ 153 ]   AspectJ Support  The spring-aspects.jar contains an annotation-driven aspect that exploits  this capability to allow dependency injection of any object with @Configurable  annotation, and with AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect behind the scenes. In this  way, you can apply dependency injection with objects created outside the control of  any IoC container using the new operator.  An example of a domain class:  package org.springaop.chapter.four.configurable;    import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;  import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Configurable;    @Configurable    public class User {        public String getName  {          return name;      }        @Autowired      public void setName String name  {          this.name = name;      }        private String name;  }  To enable the @Configurable aspect, add   in the  configuration file and configure the bean with scope=prototype.     <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans"  xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"   xmlns:context=http:  www.springframework.org schema context  xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans   http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd  http:  www.springframework.org schema context   http:  www.springframework.org schema context spring-context-2.5.xsd">                        <bean scope="prototype" class="org.springaop.chapter.four. configurable.User">                       [ 154 ]   Chapter 4  To use the Spring aspect, you have to include the spring-aspects.jar  file  located in the dist weaving directory of the Spring distribution  in  your classpath.  Advice ordering A situation that could occur in the execution of logic contained in advices is a conflict  in their execution. This is because some pointcuts could be defined so that they are  executed concurrently during a method's execution.   To solve this problem, we can specify a priority order of advices and aspects,  implementing the interface contained in the package org.springframework.core.  public interface Ordered { int getOrder  ; }  These are the cases that we can have:           The aspect classes that don't implement this interface are executed after those  that implement it.  The aspect classes that implement it are executed according to the value: the  lower the value, the higher is the priority. Classes that have the same order are not executed in a predefined sequence;  however, they are executed before any class with lower order and after those  with higher order.   With annotations, we put @Order value , whereas with XML schema we use   the tag   on the bean or implement the  Ordered interface.  Configuration mixin The two types of configuration can be easily used simultaneously. They indicate   to Spring to use the annotations with the autoproxying tag and the XML   based scheme.  Aspect instantiation model The default instantiation model of Aspect is Singleton model. Therefore, there will  be a single instance of each aspect within the application context.  [ 155 ]   AspectJ Support  It is possible to define aspects with alternative lifecycles:   Aspect 's perthis and pertarget instantiation models  percflow, percflowbelow,  and pertypewithin  are not supported in Spring 2.5.  Here is an example of a perthis aspect:  import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect; import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;  @Aspect "perthis org.springaop.app.Manager.execute   "  public class AspectPerThis {  @Before "execution org.springaop.app.Manager.execute   "  public void controlExecuteCheck  {                }  }    …  The effect of the perthis is that one aspect instance will be created for each unique  Manager object executing an execute method  each unique object bound to this at  joinpoints matched by the pointcut expression .   The aspect instance is created the first time the method execute is invoked on the  Manager object. The aspect goes out of scope when the Manager object goes out of  scope.  The pertarget instantiation model works in exactly the same way as perthis, but  creates one aspect instance for each unique target object at matched joinpoints.  Here is an example of a pertarget aspect:    import org.aspectj.lang.JoinPoint; import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect; import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;  @Aspect "pertarget @annotation javax.annotation.security.RolesAllowed    " +     public class AspectPerTarget {  "@annotation javax.annotation.security.PermitAll   " + "@annotation javax.annotation.security.DenyAll  "        @Before "@annotation javax.annotation.security.DenyAll "  public void deny JoinPoint jp  throws Throwable {   }  throw new SecurityException  ;           }  [ 156 ]   Chapter 4  AspectJ weaving in Spring AspectJ is a language with a full compiler and support for weaving binary class files  either offline or at runtime, as classes are loaded into the virtual machine. Let's see  how we can use load-time weaving  LTW  with Spring. The Spring AOP framework only supports limited types of Aspect  pointcuts   method invocation . If you want use the complete set of Aspect  pointcuts, you must  use Aspect  load-time weaver to enable the Aspect  framework.  This is an example of a class with call pointcut:  package org.springaop.aspectj.aspects;  public aspect AspectJAspectExample {  before  : call * relax ..   {    System.out.println "relax   method is about to be       executed!" ;   }  }  Aspect  load-time weaving happens when the target classes are loaded into  VM by  a class loader. For a class to be woven, a special class loader is required to enhance  the bytecode of the target class. The configuration of the AspectJ framework is done  through a file named aop.xml in the META-INF directory in the classpath root.      <!DOCTYPE aspectj PUBLIC "-  AspectJ  DTD  EN" "http:  www.eclipse. org aspectj dtd aspectj.dtd">             AspectJAspectExample"  >                 name="org.springaop.aspectj.aspects.     <aspect   In this AspectJ configuration file, you have to specify the aspects and the  classes into which you want your aspects woven. Here we specify weaving  AspectJAspectExample into all the classes in the org.springaop.aspectj. aspects package.  [ 157 ]   AspectJ Support  Load-time weaving with Spring You may enable Spring's support for LTW in any  ava application  standalone  as well as application server based  through the use of the Spring-provided  instrumentation agent.  To do so, start the VM by specifying the -javaagent:path to spring-agent.jar  option. But Spring offers a more simple choice. You only need to declare the empty  XML element  .    <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:aop="http:  www.springframework.org schema aop" xmlns:context="http:  www.springframework.org schema context" xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd http:  www.springframework.org schema aop  http:  www.springframework.org schema aop spring-aop-2.5.xsd http:  www.springframework.org schema context http:  www.springframework.org schema context spring-context-2.5.xsd">    …    From the command line:  java -javaagent:  spring-framework-X.X dist weaving  spring-agent.jar   . .Main  Load-time weaving with AspectJ Aspect  provides a load-time weaving agent. You only need to add a VM argument   to the command line. Then your classes will get woven when they are loaded into  the  VM.  From the command line:  java -javaagent:  spring-framework-X.X lib aspectj  aspectjweaver.jar   . .Main  [ 158 ]   AOP strategy considerations In this chapter we have seen several configuration strategies. XML, annotations,  autoproxy and Load-Time Weaving. These strategies can be reduced to three  approaches: Spring AOP proxy, Spring with Aspect  weaver, or simply Aspect .  Now think about the conditions that best fit the following prerequisites.   Spring AOP proxy:  Chapter 4  There are no domain objects with crosscutting functionality. Full features of Aspect  are not required. The IDE must support A DT. You don't want to use Aspect  compiler.  You don't want to change the deploy configuration.                           Spring with Aspect  Weaver:  Domain objects have crosscutting functionalities. LTW can be enabled at deploy time. Long load time at LTW is not an issue.  Aspect :  Full joinpoints are required. The build system can use Aspect . Long compile time is not an issue.  Summary In this chapter, we gave a general view of the integration between Aspect  and   Spring using the powerful syntax of joinpont definition, both through annotations  and XML configuration.  We saw how AspectJ, through annotations, makes the work of defining the  application of advices easier. We have much shorter configuration files, since we  don't have to configure each AOP component in the classic way.  The other option is the configuration with AspectJ through XML file, which is far  simpler compared to the classic version and becomes nearly compulsory if we use   a  DK previous to 1.5, which is the one that supports annotations.  In the last part, I gave some advice to solve conflicts in the priorities of execution,  and about the possible uses of the different configuration methods.   [ 159 ]    Design with AOP  In this chapter, we're going to examine some design decisions that are important for  building better applications. In these design decisions, the AOP plays a significant  role because it provides smart solutions to common crosscutting problems.   We will look at the following AOP design solutions:         Concurrency with AOP Transparent caching with AOP Security with AOP  Designing and implementing an enterprise  ava application means not only dealing  with the application core business and architecture, but also with some typical  enterprise requirements.  We have to define how the application manages concurrency so that the application  is robust and does not suffer too badly from an increase in the number of requests.  We have to define the caching strategies for the application because we don't want  CPU- or data-intensive operations to be executed over and over.  We have to define roles and profiles, applying security policies and restricting access  to application parts, because different kinds of users will probably have different  rights and permissions. All these issues require writing additional code that clutters  our application business code and reduces its modularity and maintainability.  But we have a choice. We can design our enterprise  ava application keeping AOP in  mind. This will help us to concentrate on our actual business code, taking away all  the infrastructure issues that can otherwise be expressed as crosscutting concerns.  This chapter will introduce such issues, and will show how to design and implement  solutions to them with Spring 2.5 AOP support.   Design with AOP  Concurrency with AOP For many developers, concurrency remains a mystery. Concurrency is the system's ability to act with several requests simultaneously, such  a way that threads don't corrupt the state of objects when they gain access at the  same time.  A number of good books have been written on this subject, such as Concurrent  Programming in Java and Java Concurrency in Practice. They deserve much attention,  since concurrency is an aspect that's hard to understand, and not immediately visible  to developers. Problems in the area of concurrency are hard to reproduce. However,  it's important to keep concurrency in mind to assure that the application is robust  regardless of the number of users it will serve.  If we don't take into account concurrency and document when and how the  problems of concurrency are considered, we will build an application taking some  risks by supposing that the CPU will never simultaneously schedule processes on  parts of our application that are not thread-safe.   To ensure the building of robust and scalable systems, we use proper patterns. There  are  DK packages just for concurrency. They are in the java.util.concurrent  package, a result of  SR-166. One of these patterns is the read-write lock pattern, which consists of is the interface  java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock and some implementations, one of   which is ReentrantReadWriteLock.  The goal of ReadWriteLock is to allow the reading of an object from a virtually  endless number of threads, while only one thread at a time can modify it. In this  way, the state of the object can never be corrupted because threads reading the  object's state will always read up-to-date data, and the thread modifying the state  of the object in question will be able to act without the possibility of the object's  state being corrupted. Another necessary feature is that the result of a thread's  action can be visible to the other threads. The behavior is the same as we could have  achieved using synchronized, but when using a read-write lock we are explicitly  synchronizing the actions, whereas with synchronized synchronization is implicit.  Now let's see an example of ReadWriteLock on the BankAccountThreadSafe object.  Before the read operation that needs to be safe, we set the read lock. After the read  operation, we release the read lock.  [ 162 ]   Before the write operation that needs to be safe, we set the write lock. After a state  modification, we release the write lock.  Chapter 5  package org.springaop.chapter.five.concurrent;  import java.util.Date; import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock; import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock; import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;  public final class BankAccountThreadSafe {     public BankAccountThreadSafe Integer id  {       this.id = id;       balance = new Float 0 ;       startDate = new Date  ;    }     public BankAccountThreadSafe Integer id, Float balance  {       this.id = id;       this.balance = balance;       startDate = new Date  ;    }     public BankAccountThreadSafe Integer id, Float balance, Date start   {       this.id = id;       this.balance = balance;       this.startDate = start;    }     public boolean debitOperation Float debit  {        wLock.lock  ;       try {           float balance = getBalance  ;           if  balance < debit  {              return false;           } else {              setBalance balance - debit ;              return true;          }       } finally {  [ 163 ]   Design with AOP           wLock.unlock  ;       }    }     public void creditOperation Float credit  {        wLock.lock  ;       try {          setBalance getBalance   + credit ;     private void setBalance Float balance  {        } finally {           wLock.unlock  ;       }    }        wLock.lock  ;       try {          balance = balance;        } finally {           wLock.unlock  ;       }    }     public Float getBalance   {        rLock.lock  ;        try {          return balance;         } finally {           rLock.unlock  ;       }    }     public Integer getId   {       return id;    }     public Date getStartDate   {        return  Date  startDate.clone  ;    }     …  [ 164 ]   Chapter 5     private Float balance;    private final Integer id;    private final Date startDate;    private final ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock  ;    private final Lock rLock = lock.readLock  ;    private final Lock wLock = lock.writeLock  ; }  BankAccountThreadSafe is a class that doesn't allow a bank account to be  overdrawn  that is, have a negative balance , and it's an example of a thread-safe  class. The final fields are set in the constructors, hence implicitly thread-safe.  The balance field, on the other hand, is managed in a thread-safe way by the  setBalance, getBalance, creditOperation, and debitOperation methods.  In other words, this class is correctly programmed, concurrency-wise. The problem is  that wherever we would like to have those characteristics, we have to write the same  code  especially the finally block containing the lock's release .   We can solve that by writing an aspect that carries out that task for us.        A state modification is execution void                               com.mycompany.BankAccount.set* *   A safe read is execution * com.mycompany.BankAccount.getBalance     package org.springaop.chapter.five.concurrent;  import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock; import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock; import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;  import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.After; import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect; import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before; import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Pointcut;  @Aspect public class BankAccountAspect {      *pointcuts*      @Pointcut  "execution * org.springaop.chapter.five.concurrent.BankAccount. getBalance   "   [ 165 ]   Design with AOP     public void safeRead  {}     @Pointcut  "execution * org.springaop.chapter.five.concurrent.BankAccount. set* *  "     public void stateModification  {}     @Pointcut   "execution * org.springaop.chapter.five.concurrent.BankAccount. getId   "     public void getId  {}  @Pointcut "execution * org.springaop.chapter.five.concurrent. BankAccount.getStartDate        public void getStartDate  {}      *advices*      @Before "safeRead  "     public void beforeSafeRead   {        rLock.lock  ;    }     @After "safeRead  "     public void afterSafeRead   {        rLock.unlock  ;    }     @Before "stateModification  "     public void beforeSafeWrite   {        wLock.lock  ;    }     @After "stateModification  "     public void afterSafeWrite   {        wLock.unlock  ;    }     private final ReadWriteLock lock = new  ReentrantReadWriteLock  ;    private final Lock rLock = lock.readLock  ;    private final Lock wLock = lock.writeLock  ; }  [ 166 ]   Chapter 5  The BankAccountAspect class applies the crosscutting functionality. In this case,  the functionality is calling the lock and unlock methods on the ReadLock and the  WriteLock. The before methods apply the locks with the @Before annotation,   while the after methods release the locks as if they were in the final block, with   the @After annotation that is always executed  an after-finally advice .  In this way the BankAccount class can become much easier, clearer, and briefer.   It doesn't need any indication that it can be executed in a thread-safe manner.  package org.springaop.chapter.five.concurrent;   import java.util.Date;  public class BankAccount {     public BankAccount Integer id  {       this.id = id;       this.balance = new Float 0 ;       this.startDate = new Date  ;    }     public BankAccount Integer id, Float balance  {       this.id = id;       this.balance = balance;       this.startDate = new Date  ;    }     public BankAccount Integer id, Float balance, Date start  {       this.id = id;       this.balance = balance;       this.startDate = start;    }     public boolean debitOperation Float debit  {        float balance = getBalance  ;        if  balance < debit  {           setBalance balance - debit ;           return false;        } else {           return true;       }    }     public void creditOperation Float credit  {        setBalance getBalance   + credit ;  [ 167 ]   Design with AOP     }     private void setBalance Float balance  {        this.balance = balance;    }     public Float getBalance   {        return balance;    }     public Integer getId   {        return id;    }     public Date getStartDate   {        return  Date  startDate.clone  ;    }     private Float balance;    private final Integer id;    private final Date startDate;  }  Another good design choice, together with the use of ReadWriteLock when  necessary, is using objects that once built are immutable, and therefore, not  corruptible and can be easily shared between threads.  Transparent caching with AOP Often, the objects that compose applications perform the same operations with the  same arguments and obtain the same results. Sometimes, these operations are costly  in terms of CPU usage, or may be there is a lot of I O going on while executing   those operations.  To get better results in terms of speed and resources used, it's suggested to use a  cache. We can store in it the results corresponding to the methods' invocations  as key-value pairs: method and arguments as key and return object as value.    Once you decide to use a cache you're just halfway. In fact, you must decide which  part of the application is going to use the cache. Let's think about a web application  backed by a database. Such a web application usually involves Data Access Objects   DAOs , which access the relational database. Such objects are usually a bottleneck   in the application as there is a lot of I O going on. In other words, a cache can be  used there.  [ 168 ]   Chapter 5  The cache can also be used by the business layer that has already aggregated and  elaborated data retrieved from repositories, or it can be used by the presentation  layer putting formatted presentation templates in the cache, or even by the  authentication system that keeps roles according to an authenticated username.  There are almost no limits as to how you can optimize an application and make it  faster. The only price you pay is having RAM to dedicate the objects that are to be  kept in memory, besides paying attention to the rules on how to manage the life of  the objects in cache.  After these preliminary remarks, using a cache could seem common and obvious. A  cache essentially acts as a hash into which key-value pairs are put. The keys are used  to retrieve objects from the cache. Caching usually has configuration parameters that  allow you to change its behavior. Now let's have a look at an example with ehcache  http:  ehcache.sourceforge. net . First of all let's configure it with the name methodCache so that we have at the  most 1000 objects. The objects are inactive for a maximum of five minutes, with a  maximum life of 10 minutes. If the objects count is over 1000, ehcache saves them   on the filesystem, in java.io.tmpdir.       …         ….     <defaultCache         maxElementsInMemory="10000"       eternal="false"       timeToIdleSeconds="120"       timeToLiveSeconds="120"       overflowToDisk="true"       diskPersistent="false"       diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds="120"       >        …    <cache    name="methodCache"          maxElementsInMemory="1000"          eternal="false"          overflowToDisk="false"          timeToIdleSeconds="300"          timeToLiveSeconds="600"     >    [ 169 ]   Design with AOP  Now let's create a CacheAspect. Let's define the cacheObject to which the  ProceedingJoinPoint is passed. Let's recover an unambiguous key from the  ProceedingJoinPoint with the method getCacheKey. We will use this key to   put the objects into the cache and to recover them.  Once we have obtained the key, we ask to cache the Element with the instruction  cache.get cacheKey . The Element has to be evaluated because it may be null if   the cache didn't find an Element with the passed cacheKey.  If the Element is null, advice invokes the method proceed  , and puts in the cache  the Element with the key corresponding to the invocation. Otherwise, if the Element  recovered from the cache is not null, the method isn't invoked on the target class,  and the value taken from the cache is returned to the caller.  package org.springaop.chapter.five.cache;   import it.springaop.utils.Constants; import net.sf.ehcache.Cache; import net.sf.ehcache.Element;  import org.apache.log4j.Logger; import org.aspectj.lang.ProceedingJoinPoint;  public class CacheAspect {     public Object cacheObject ProceedingJoinPoint pjp  throws Throwable  {        Object result;       String cacheKey = getCacheKey pjp ;        Element element =  Element  cache.get cacheKey ;       logger.info new StringBuilder "CacheAspect invoke:" .append "\n  get:"              .append cacheKey .append " value:" .append element . toString   ;        if  element == null  {              result = pjp.proceed  ;           element = new Element cacheKey, result ;           cache.put element ;           logger.info new StringBuilder "\n put:" .append cacheKey . append                 " value:" .append result .toString   ;       }  [ 170 ]   Chapter 5        return element.getValue  ;    }  public void flush   {       cache.flush  ;    }     private String getCacheKey ProceedingJoinPoint pjp  {        String targetName = pjp.getTarget  .getClass  .getSimpleName  ;       String methodName = pjp.getSignature  .getName  ;       Object[] arguments = pjp.getArgs  ;        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder  ;       sb.append targetName .append "." .append methodName ;       if   arguments != null  &&  arguments.length != 0   {          for  int i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++  {             sb.append "." .append arguments[i] ;          }       }       return sb.toString  ;    }     public void setCache Cache cache  {       this.cache = cache;    }     private Cache cache;    private Logger logger = Logger.getLogger Constants.LOG_NAME ; }  Here is applicationContext.xml:  <beans xmlns=»http:  www.springframework.org schema beans» xmlns:xsi=»http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance»  xmlns:aop=»http:  www.springframework.org schema aop» xsi:schemaLocation=»http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd http:  www.springframework.org schema aop  http:  www.springframework.org schema aop spring-aop-2.5.xsd»>      …        <bean id="rockerCacheAspect"  class="org.springaop.chapter.five. cache.CacheAspect" >                                       [ 171 ]   Design with AOP                          <bean id="cache" abstract="true"    class="org.springframework.cache.ehcache.EhCacheFactoryBean">         <bean id="cacheManager" class="org.springframework.cache.ehcache.

Employing an around advice, we can use the cache to make the method invocations  return the cached result of a previous invocation of the same method in a totally  transparent way. In fact, to the methods of the classes defined in the interception rules  in pointcuts will be given back the return values drawn from the cache or, if these are  not present, they will be invoked and inserted in the cache. In this way, the classes and  methods don't have any knowledge of obtaining values retrieved from the cache.  Let's define the pointcut that intercepts the methods of the class DummyClass.  <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"  xmlns:aop="http:  www.springframework.org schema aop" xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd http:  www.springframework.org schema aop  http:  www.springframework.org schema aop spring-aop-2.5.xsd">    …       <aop:pointcut id="readOperation" expression= "execution * org.springaop.chapter.five.cache.DummyClass.get* ..

The dummy bean, used to test the cache's working. 2.  The readOperation and exitOperation pointcuts. 3.  The dummyCacheAspect aspect, with around and after advices. 4.  The rockerCacheAspect, which is the implementation of the aspect class   that contains the logic of recovery from and insertion into the cache.  5.  The cache bean, which is an EhCacheFactoryBean. 6.  The cacheManager bean, which is an EhCacheManagerFactoryBean.  Here is the test class:  package org.springaop.chapter.five.cache;  import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext; import org.springframework.context.support. ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;  public class CacheTest {     public static void main String[] args {        String[] paths = { "org springaop chapter five cache  applicationContext.xml" };        ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext   paths ;        DummyClass dummy =  DummyClass  ctx.getBean "dummy" ;       dummy.getFooFighters  ;       dummy.getHives "2004" ;       dummy.getDandyWarhols  ;        dummy.getFooFighters  ;       dummy.getHives "2004" ;       dummy.getDandyWarhols  ;  dummy.exit  ;    } }  [ 175 ]   Design with AOP  The result will be:  As we can see from the log, the first invocations of methods are always followed by  put because the cache didn't contain the results of invocations.   On the second calls, the values are instead recovered by the cache with key  className.method.arguments. The number of hits, the date of creation, and   the last access are shown as well.  Security with AOP Security is one of the most important elements of an application. The word "security"  covers two concepts:        Authentication is the verification's process of a principal's identity; a  principal is typically a user. A principal in order to be authenticated  provides a credential that is the password. Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of granting authorities,  which are usually roles, to an authenticated user.  Once a user is authenticated and has roles, he or she can work on the application and   perform the actions permitted by an access control list, which according to the user's  roles allows certain operations.  [ 176 ]   Chapter 5  Before Spring Security, the rules of who can do what were usually implemented  using custom code and an in-house framework, or using JAAS. Usually, the first   type of implementation was a consequence of the second type's difficulty.  Unfortunately, though custom-type security fits its purposes, it lacks in its main  aim. This is because it's safer to employ a much-used framework that is constantly  updated and corrects security problems, rather than having an in-house framework  that might be barely tested. Beside these considerations, which should be carefully  take into account, defining and applying security rules without AOP means causing  code tangling and code scattering.  In fact, AOP applied to security solves most of the common practical problems  concerning security. In order to solve them we use Spring Security 2.0.x   formerly  Acegi Security System for Spring , configuring it properly to carry out most of the  work according to the application's needs. We will see its configuration in Chapter 7.  Now let's look just at some parts where AOP intervenes in its configuration.  For now, we will not deal with the authentications and roles attribution. Instead,  we will start from the point at which the decision is taken to authorize a user and to  provide him or her with roles to access a certain resource. Taking an actual decision  whether or not to allow the user  based on its roles  gain access to the secure resource  is the responsibility of the access decision manager.  An access decision manager implements the AccessDecisionManager interface,  and in order to carry out his or her job, the manager needs a group of voters which  implement the AccessDecisionVoter interface.  The AccessDecisionManagers provided by Spring are:  AffirmativeBased: At least one voter votes to grant access ConsensusBased: A consensus of voters votes to grant access UnanimousBased: All voters vote to abstain or grant access   If none of them is specified, we employ AffirmativeBased with two voters,  RoleVoter and AuthenticatedVoter. A voter can vote to grant, deny, or abstain.  RoleVoter: This bases its vote on role. If the user has the required role by the  required resource, it votes ACCESS_GRANTED. But if the resource doesn't have  a specified role, it votes ACCESS_ABSTAIN. If the resource has a role the user  doesn't have, then it votes ACCESS_DENIED. AuthenticatedVoter: This votes on the strength of the user's authentication.  A user can be authenticated with:  IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY  IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED                     [ 177 ]   Design with AOP       IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY AuthenticatedVoter votes ACCESS_GRANTED if the  authentication level is higher than the level requested by the  resource. The highest one is IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY.  In the following XML, we see the declaration of the access decision manager:  <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance"  xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema security" xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans  http:  www.springframework.org schema security http:  www.springframework.org schema security spring-security- 2.0.4.xsd http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd"> …   <bean id="accessDecisionManager" class="org.springframework. security.vote.AffirmativeBased">                                   <bean class="org.springframework.security.vote.AuthenticatedVoter"   >                                   Once we have defined the AccessDecisionManager, we can use AOP to decide the  roles that are necessary to call the several beans' methods.  We can employ three strategies:  1.  Securing methods with security interceptors. 2.  Securing methods with pointcuts. 3.  Securing methods with annotations.  In order to employ interceptors, the aspectjrt.jar and  aspectjweaver.jar  ARs must be in the classpath. For the annotations,  there must be the  AR spring-security-core-tiger-2.0.x.jar.  [ 178 ]   Securing methods with security interceptors With security interceptors we can define the roles necessary to execute methods on  the bean.  Chapter 5  Let's have the interface:  public interface FooService {     public Integer getBalance Integer idAccount ;    public void setBalanceAccount Integer id, Integer balance ;    public boolean suspendAccount Integer id ;  }  FooService is implemented by FooServiceImpl, that is configured as follows :  <beans xmlns="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:security="http:  www.springframework.org schema security" xsi:schemaLocation="http:  www.springframework.org schema beans http:  www.springframework.org schema beans spring-beans-2.5.xsd http:  www.springframework.org schema security http:  www.springframework.org schema security spring-security- 2.0.4.xsd"> …       <bean id="accessDecisionManager" class="org.springframework. security.vote.AffirmativeBased">                                      <bean class="org.springframework.security.vote.RoleVoter"   >     <bean class="org.springframework.security.vote.AuthenticatedVoter"   >                               …          <security:intercept-methods          access-decision-manager-ref="accessDecisionManager">          <security:protect method="org.springaop.chapter.five. security.FooService.getBalance"             access="ROLE_USER"  >          <security:protect  [ 179 ]   Design with AOP              method="org.springaop.chapter.five.security.FooService. setBalanceAccount"              access="ROLE_ACCOUNTING,ROLE_ADMIN"  >          <security:protect method="org.springaop.chapter.five. security.FooService.suspendAccount"             access="ROLE_ADMIN"  >              …    We have defined some roles  separated by a comma  that can execute those method  we want to be executed by a user that has a particular role. This choice permits us to  define roles on methods directly on beans, but makes the configuration files too long.   Securing methods with pointcuts With this strategy, it's possible to define the roles required for the different pointcuts  with AspectJ syntax that we define with the tag global-method-security.  We use the same rules on the same methods of the interface FooService.    <global-method-security           access-decision-manager-ref="accessDecisionManager">        <protect-pointcut          expression="execution * org.springaop.chapter.five.security. FooService.getBalance ..  "          access="ROLE_USER"  >       <protect-pointcut          expression="execution * org.springaop.chapter.five.security. FooService.set* ..  "          access="ROLE_ACCOUNTING,ROLE_ADMIN"  >       <protect-pointcut          expression="execution * org.springaop.chapter.five.security.  org.springaop.chapter.five.security. org.springaop.chapter.five.security. FooService.suspendAccount ..  "          access="ROLE_ADMIN"  >       When using pointcuts, we don't have to use interceptors if they can be in conflict  with the execution of methods that we have defined in the configuration. This  modality of configuration is consistent with AspectJ syntax for the definition of  pointcuts, making the modality of configuration of aspects homogeneous.  Compared to interceptors, the configuration is less prolix and dispersive as it  concentrates the methods that can be invoked with the different roles at one point.  [ 180 ]   Chapter 5  Securing methods with annotations We can use annotations to define which roles can be executed by the methods of our  classes. We will use the same rules on the same methods of the interface  We will use the same rules on the same methods of the interface FooService.  package org.springaop.chapter.five.security;  import org.springframework.security.annotation.Secured;  public class FooServiceImplWithAnnotations implements FooService{      @Secured "ROLE_USER"      public Integer getBalance Integer idAccount  {         Integer result = 0;            do something         return result;     }      @Secured  { "ROLE_ACCOUNTING", "ROLE_ADMIN" }      public void setBalanceAccount Integer id, Integer balance  {            do something     }      @Secured "ROLE_ADMIN"      public boolean suspendAccount Integer id  {         boolean result = false;            do something         return result;     } }  With this strategy, we define the roles within the class, needed for the execution  of methods. With this choice we don't have to configure any XML, but we lose the  possibility of seeing the roles for the methods present defined in a single place.   Summary In this chapter we've seen how to implement crosscutting functionalities, such  as concurrency control, the employment of a cache, and security management.  Without AOP those functionalities would be scattered across the application, with  the same code duplicated in different modules. With AOP we can have cleaner  code, much more concise and easier to maintain and debug. We've seen how it is  possible to implement these functionalities without having tangled or scattered code,  implementing functionalities with aspects and advices.  Other important functionalities are transactions management, application logging,  exception management, layout, and others. They will be illustrated in the next two  chapters in a complete and working application.   [ 181 ]    Three-tier Spring Application,  Domain-Driven Design  This chapter presents an overview of the Domain-Driven Design  DDD  concept  and explains its capabilities and features. Here is a brief outline of the topics covered  in this chapter:         Domain-Driven Design  The Domain layer of the sample application The Infrastructure layer of the sample application  Domain-Driven Design DDD is not a technology or methodology. It is a way of thinking and a set of  priorities aimed at accelerating software projects that have to deal with complicated  domains   http:  www.domaindrivendesign.org  . For many years, designing and realizing  EE application has meant moving Data  Transfer Objects  DTO  and Value Objects  VO  between layers and writing  procedural code to allow Enterprise JavaBeans  EJB  to do their work. This led to the use of classes that were defined as anemic by Martin Fowler    http:  martinfowler.com bliki AnemicDomainModel.html , that's to say,  classes where the business logic is completely separate from the domain objects;  usually it is in a service layer, which uses the domain classes as classes of data.  The business logic is contained in services using anemic domain models. But as we  have seen, the application works in a procedural way, and is not object-oriented. The  objects are mere carriers of data realized as DTO or VO, with only the methods get  and set. They have no behavior.   Three-tier Spring Application, Domain-Driven Design  As well as being an anti-pattern, this is a misuse of the Object-Oriented  Programming  OOP  paradigm. OOP provides concepts and constructs that   simplify and rationalize the design of application model and business logic.   DDD proposes a lot of little domain classes, instead of the big service classes,   that generate anemic domain models. We have indeed gone back to the origins of   OOP, when the objects had states and behaviors as models of the entities of a  particular domain.  DDD uses all of the OOP concepts to define the business logic in the domain   classes, making it easier to modify the application as requirements change and   where needed.   The application is extendable, modular, and easy to change. Also, the testability is  improved, and the customer and the development team use a common language   ubiquitous language .  Using anemic classes, a fat service layer is created where we have façade classes to  move anemic objects that are used only as data containers.  For details about façade  pattern http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Facade_pattern.    This leads to the same problems for which we apply AOP with the OOP: duplicated  code that is scattered in several classes, façade classes in this case.  In the rest of the chapter, we will see how AOP and Dependency Injection support  the design obtained with DDD and make class testing easier.   Roles and responsibilities In this section we are going to see a generic organization to define the roles and  responsibilities of objects with DDD. This organization should be considered open.  If we need to act in a different way, we are free to do so.  Entities These are objects that have their own identity and almost always correspond to real  concepts. They are the core of the domain model, and are realized as Plain Old Java  Objects  POJO .  Aggregates The domain model can be composed of several associated entities. If aggregated,  they can be considered as a unique entity that must be accessible from a unique point  to preserve the integrity of the objects contained. An aggregation is accessible only  through the root, that is, an entity.  [ 184 ]   Chapter 6  The root internally keeps the references to all the objects that compose the  aggregation, which in some cases have an identity only as parts of the aggregation.   If we have to act on the aggregation, it's the root that makes the modifications in a  controlled way. As the entities inside the aggregation can't be accessed from outside,  their state can't be corrupted.  If we need to pass data to the external code, a copy  and not the reference  is passed  just to make the aggregation impenetrable to external modifications. Everything has  to pass through the root. If the root is removed, all the objects of the aggregation are  removed. The root guarantees the maintenance of invariance.  Modules When the application gets bigger, the model grows consequently. To manage   the organization and complexity, the domain model is divided into modules that   are interrelated.  Value objects These are objects defined only by the value of their attributes and have no behavior  and identity.  They are often unchangeable, and since they are defined only by the value of their  attributes, they are interchangeable.   Factories These define methods to create entities that may need many operations to be built.  Above all, in this case, it would be necessary to build a complex graph of objects.  The factory becomes responsible for the encapsulation of the logic behind the  creation of object graphs that are linked and work together to perform necessary  business logic.  This encapsulation enables the caller class to have the entities needed to perform   its work.  Repositories The repository classes manage the entity collections and read write update   delete methods.  [ 185 ]   Three-tier Spring Application, Domain-Driven Design  The exposed methods are declared in the interface, which masks the implementation,  which uses the framework for persistence.  Defining the operations through the interface in terms of domain objects eliminates  the need to focus on the details of persistence.   Services Services are objects that have responsibilities that can't be contained in a class   of a single domain model, and so act on several objects, nearly always in a   transactional way.  A service has three characteristics:          The operation is related to a domain concept that is not a natural part of an  entity or VO The interface is defined in terms of other elements of the domain model The operation is stateless  Architecture After seeing the division of responsibilities, we will see the conceptual architecture.  User interface  This is the presentation layer. Its task is presenting information from the application  to the user, and acquiring commands from the user to the application.   Application layer The application layer's task is to coordinate the application's activities. It doesn't  contain any business logic or object status, but rather maintains the progress status of  the application tasks such as navigation in the User Interface  UI  and validation of  the fields received by the application.  Domain layer This layer contains the business domain and the status of the business objects, which  contain the status and behavior of business entities, and the business rules.  If it is necessary to execute several steps to perform a business use case, it maintains  information about status among the steps.  [ 186 ]   Chapter 6  In addition to domain objects, it also contains services that implement logic that can't  be contained in a single domain object.  The objects contained in this layer do not depend on any framework employed in  other layers because it must be completely isolated from the other layers.  In this layer we find entities, VO, services, and factories.  All the concepts of OOP have been used in the implementation of this layer:  interfaces, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Entities have status   attributes  and behavior  methods that act on the state  because they have to   model concepts of the real world.   However, by using all the features of OOP we fall again into the problems explained  in the first chapter, such as code scattering and tangling.  In order to support the domain layer, AOP and Dependency Injection are employed.  Infrastructure layer  This layer provides support to the other layers, such as persistence, support for the  UI, and allowing communication between layers. This layer contains the repositories.  Sample application The application we are going to prototype creates an online wholesale fresh-fruit  shop, a market where in the evening goods that will be delivered to customers the  next morning are traded. In this way, goods are not collected and handled until there  is actually a buyer. The buyer buys goods that are actually available and will collect  them the next morning to sell at a retail market.  Farmers inform about the availability of a certain quantity of fruit they offer,  pointing out the main features that qualify the product.  Certified customers buy a certain quantity of different kinds of fruits.  At the time of ordering, the system ensures the full availability of goods  orders take  place in real time . The order will be put in ACCEPTED status and the customer will be  immediately notified. The customer can pay by credit card and get the goods early  the next morning.  [ 187 ]   Three-tier Spring Application, Domain-Driven Design  The following image contains an overview of the application:  [ 188 ]   Chapter 6  Design The first step in the use of DDD is the location of entities.   Let's define a method that is shared between all the entities to identify   them univocally.  package it.freshfruits.domain.entity;  public interface BaseEntity {     public Integer getId  ; }  Let's identify the customer in the domain, since the sale of the produce is the first  reason for the application's existence.  package it.freshfruits.domain.entity;  public interface NamedEntity extends BaseEntity{     public String getName  ; }  NamedEntity adds a getName to BaseEntity:  package it.freshfruits.domain.entity;  import it.freshfruits.domain.vo.Address; import it.freshfruits.domain.vo.ContactInformation;  import java.util.List;  public interface Customer extends NamedEntity{     public Address getAddress  ;     public ContactInformation getContact  ;     public void modifyContactInformation ContactInformation contact ;     public void modifyAddress Address address ;     public Boolean saveCustomer  ;     public Boolean createOrder  ;     public Boolean saveOrder  ;     public Order getOrder  ;     public List  getOrders  ; }  [ 189 ]   Three-tier Spring Application, Domain-Driven Design  Customer interface define the customer's behaviors.  The entity Customer uses internally VO Address and VO ContactInformation.  Let's identify the fruit type in the domain. It may seem a VO, but it represents the  type of object bought by the customer; vice versa, the real VO is the item in the order.  package it.freshfruits.domain.entity;  import java.math.BigDecimal;  public interface FruitType extends NamedEntity{     public String getLocation  ;     public String getColor  ;     public String getFlavour  ;     public BigDecimal getPrice  ; }  The entity FruitType represents a type of fruit with its characteristics.  The following Order class represents an order from a customer.  package it.freshfruits.domain.entity;  import it.freshfruits.domain.vo.OrderItem;  import java.math.BigDecimal; import java.util.Date; import java.util.Set;  public interface Order extends BaseEntity{     public String getStatus  ;     public String getIdCustomer  ;     public Set  getOrderItems  ;     public Integer getNumberItems  ;     public void addOrderItem OrderItem item ;     public void saveOrder  ;     public BigDecimal getOrderAmount  ;     public Date getDateOrder  ;     public Boolean removeOrderItem String idItem ; }   [ 190 ]   Chapter 6  The entity Order contains a Set of VO OrderItem . Any OrderItem contains the  information about the quantity and amount of a certain FruitType.  Each OrderItem contains a FruitType different from others. An Order can't contain  two instances of OrderItem with the same FruitType.  The OrderItem represents one of the elements that compose the Order of   a Customer.  package it.freshfruits.domain.vo;  import java.math.BigDecimal;  import it.freshfruits.domain.entity.FruitType;  public interface OrderItem {     public FruitType getFruitType  ;     public Integer getQuantity  ;     public Integer getIdOrder  ;     public BigDecimal getAmountItem  ; }  An Address object acts as a VO object that contains address information.  The Address represents the address of a Customer.  package it.freshfruits.domain.vo;  ContactInformation represents contact information about the Customer.  public interface Address {     public String getStreet  ;     public String getCity  ;      public String getState  ; }   package it.freshfruits.domain.vo;  public interface ContactInformation {     public String getPhoneNumber  ;     public String getMobilePhoneNumber  ;     public String getFaxNumber  ;     public String getEmail  ; }  [ 191 ]   Three-tier Spring Application, Domain-Driven Design  It is important to underline that, apart from being an entity, Customer is  also an aggregate that performs the work of root towards Address and  ContactInformation. In fact, the interfaces of Address and ContactInformation  provide only accessors method to avoid compromising their internal state.  Let's see the implementations of Customer and the VO that it contains    Address and ContactInformation .   package it.freshfruits.domain.entity;    import it.freshfruits.application.repository.CustomerRepository;  import it.freshfruits.application.repository.OrderRepository;  import it.freshfruits.domain.vo.Address;  import it.freshfruits.domain.vo.AddressImpl;  import it.freshfruits.domain.vo.ContactInformation;  import it.freshfruits.domain.vo.ContactInformationImpl;  import it.freshfruits.util.Constants;    import java.io.Serializable;  import java.util.Date;  import java.util.List;    import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowire;  import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;  import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Configurable;  import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier;    @Configurable dependencyCheck = true, autowire = Autowire.BY_TYPE   public class CustomerImpl implements Customer, Serializable {        public Boolean createOrder   {          Boolean result = false;          if  order == null  {              order = new OrderImpl.Builder Constants.ID_NEW, new  Date  , id.toString   .build  ;              result = true;          }          return result;      }        public Boolean saveCustomer   {          return customerRepository.saveCustomer this ;      }        public Address getAddress   {          return address;      }        public ContactInformation getContact   {  [ 192 ]   Chapter 6          return contactInformation;      }        public Integer getId   {          return id;      }        public String getName   {          return name;      }        public void modifyContactInformation ContactInformation contact  {          contactInformation = contact;      }        public void modifyAddress Address address  {          this.address = address;      }        public List  getOrders   {          return orderRepository.getOrders id.toString   ;      }        public Order getOrder   {          return order;      }        public Boolean saveOrder   {          return orderRepository.saveOrder order ;      }        public String toString   {          return new StringBuilder  .append "\nid:" .append id . append "\nname:" .append name .append "\n " . append address .append "\n " .append   contactInformation                   .toString  ;      }        public static class Builder {             Required parameters          private String name = "";          private Integer id = 0;               Optional parameters          private Address address;          private ContactInformation contactInformation;          private OrderRepository orderRepository;          private CustomerRepository customerRepository;   [ 193 ]   Three-tier Spring Application, Domain-Driven Design          public Builder String name, String id  {              this.name = name;              this.id = Integer.valueOf id ;          }            public Builder String name, String id, Address address,  ContactInformation contact  {              this.name = name;              this.id = Integer.valueOf id ;              this.address = address;              this.contactInformation = contact;          }            public Builder address String street, String city, String  state  {              address = new AddressImpl.Builder street, city, state . build  ;              return this;          }            public Builder contactInfo String phoneNumber, String  mobilePhoneNumber, String faxNumber, String email  {              contactInformation = new ContactInformationImpl.

To let it  perform  its work, the dependencies are injected at the moment of the creation of  the Customer through the annotation @Configurable dependencyCheck = true,  autowire=Autowire.BY_TYPE   It does not have public constructors and new instances are built using a Builder.  It interacts with two repositories to perform operations: the OrderRepository and  the CustomerRepository. It allows placing a new order and saving the customer's  address. Using the order provided by customer, it is possible to perform all the  operations defined by the Order interface.  The AddressImpl class implements the VO interface Address.  package it.freshfruits.domain.vo;  import it.freshfruits.util.ValidationUtils;  public final class AddressImpl implements Address {     public static class Builder {       private String street = "";       private String city = "";       private String state = "";  [ 195 ]   Three-tier Spring Application, Domain-Driven Design        public Builder String street, String city, String state  {          ValidationUtils.validateStreet street ;           ValidationUtils.validateCity city ;          ValidationUtils.validateState state ;          this.street = street;          this.city = city;          this.state = state;       }     public String toString   {       return new StringBuilder  .append "\nstreet:" .append street . append              "\ncity:" .append city .append "\nstate:" .append state              .toString  ;    }        public AddressImpl build   {          return new AddressImpl this ;       }    }     public String getStreet   {       return street;    }     public String getCity   {       return city;    }     public String getState   {       return state;    }     private AddressImpl Builder builder  {       city = builder.city;       state = builder.state;       street = builder.street;    }     private String street = "";    private String city = "";    private String state = ""; }  [ 196 ]   ContactInformationImpl implements the VO interface ContactInformation.  Chapter 6  package it.freshfruits.domain.vo;  import it.freshfruits.util.ValidationUtils;  public final class ContactInformationImpl implements  ContactInformation {     public static class Builder {       private String phoneNumber = "";       private String mobilePhoneNumber = "";       private String faxNumber = "";       private String email = "";        public Builder String phoneNumber, String mobilePhoneNumber,             String faxNumber, String email  {    ValidationUtils.validatePhoneNumber phoneNumber ;       ValidationUtils.validateMobilePhoneNumber mobilePhoneNumber ;          ValidationUtils.validateFaxNumber faxNumber ;          ValidationUtils.validateEmail email ;          this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;          this.mobilePhoneNumber = mobilePhoneNumber;          this.faxNumber = faxNumber;          this.email = email;       }        public ContactInformationImpl build   {          return new ContactInformationImpl this ;       }    }     public String getPhoneNumber   {       return phoneNumber;    }     public String getMobilePhoneNumber   {       return mobilePhoneNumber;    }     public String getFaxNumber   {       return faxNumber;    }     public String getEmail   {       return email;    }  [ 197 ]   Three-tier Spring Application, Domain-Driven Design     public String toString   {       return new StringBuilder  .append "\nphoneNumber:" . append phoneNumber      .append "\nmobilePhoneNumber:" .append mobilePhoneNumber      .append "\nfaxNumber:" .append faxNumber .append "\nemail:"              .append email .toString  ;    }     private ContactInformationImpl Builder builder  {       this.email = builder.email;       this.faxNumber = builder.faxNumber;       this.mobilePhoneNumber = builder.mobilePhoneNumber;       this.phoneNumber = builder.phoneNumber;    }     private String phoneNumber = "";    private String mobilePhoneNumber = "";    private String faxNumber = "";    private String email = ""; }  These implementations  CustomerImpl, AddressImpl, ContactInformationImpl   don't have public constructors, but internal builders and validators.  Even though AddressImpl and ContactInformationImpl are simple VO, they  contain minimal validation rules to ensure building with values that make sense for  the application. In fact, the fields are either empty or have a minimal pre-established  length. The validation on the UI will then decide if they must have values or not  and if the type is correct  numeric or text . In any case, the validation on the UI is  made both on the builder and mutator methods. The class is final to prevent the  possibility of the creation of subclasses. In the class, the override of toString is done  to allow a communicative visualization when it's needed.   AddressImpl and ContactInformationImpl are the implementations of the VO that  are used in the interface Customer.

An Order contains some OrderItem that contains information about the type of  product and the amount bought.  Services There are important domain operations that can't find a natural home in an ENTITY  or VO. Some of these are intrinsically activities or actions.  The name service explains the relationship with other objects.  Our SupplyService provides an availability check and reservation service.  package it.freshfruits.domain.service;  import it.freshfruits.domain.vo.OrderItem; import it.freshfruits.domain.vo.QuantityAndItemVO;  import java.util.List; import java.util.Map;  public interface SupplyService {      public Boolean isAvailable OrderItem item ;      public Boolean retainItem OrderItem item ;      public Boolean release String idOrder, String idItem ;      public Map  getItemsAvailable  ;      public void init  ;      public Map > getReservedItems  ; }  [ 205 ]   Three-tier Spring Application, Domain-Driven Design  This is the SupplyService implementation:  package it.freshfruits.domain.service;  import it.freshfruits.domain.entity.FruitType; import it.freshfruits.domain.entity.FruitTypeImpl; import it.freshfruits.domain.vo.OrderItem; import it.freshfruits.domain.vo.OrderItemImpl; import it.freshfruits.domain.vo.QuantityAndItemVO;  import java.math.BigDecimal; import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.List; import java.util.Map;  public class SupplyServiceImpl implements SupplyService {     public SupplyServiceImpl  {       this.availableItems = new HashMap   ;         this.reservedItems = new HashMap >  ;    }      public void init   {   test purpose only         FruitType fruit = new FruitTypeImpl.Builder "orange", new  Integer 2 , new BigDecimal "0.20"  .build  ;         OrderItem item = new OrderItemImpl.Builder fruit, 400, "1" . build  ;         availableItems.put item.getFruitType  .getId  .toString  , new  QuantityAndItemVO item  ;         FruitType fruitTwo = new FruitTypeImpl.Builder "lemon", new  Integer 3 , new BigDecimal "0.15"  .build  ;         OrderItem itemTwo = new OrderItemImpl.Builder fruitTwo, 350,  "1" .build  ;         availableItems.put itemTwo.getFruitType  .getId  .toString  ,  new QuantityAndItemVO itemTwo  ;     }      public Map  getItemsAvailable   {         return availableItems;     }      public Map > getReservedItems   {         return reservedItems;     }      public Boolean isAvailable OrderItem item  {  [ 206 ]   Chapter 6          return availableItems.containsKey item.getFruitType  .getId  . toString   ;     }      public Boolean release String idOrder, String idItem  {         Boolean result = false;          List  listItems = reservedItems.get idOrder ;          if  listItems != null && listItems.size   > 0  {              for  int index = 0; index < listItems.size  ; index++  {                  OrderItem item = listItems.get index ;                 if  item.getFruitType  .getId  .toString  . equals idItem   {                    listItems.remove item ;                     QuantityAndItemVO qat = availableItems. get idItem ;                     qat.add item.getQuantity   ;                     availableItems.put idItem, qat ;                     reservedItems.put idOrder, listItems ;                     result = true;                 }             }         }         return result;     }      public Boolean retainItem OrderItem item  {          Boolean result = false;          QuantityAndItemVO qat = availableItems.get item. getFruitType  .getId  .toString   ;          if  qat != null  {              if  qat.getQuantity   >= item.getQuantity    {                  List  items = reservedItems.get item. getIdOrder  .toString   ;                 if  items == null  {                    items = new ArrayList   ;                 }                 items.add item ;                 reservedItems.put item.getIdOrder  .toString  ,  items ;  [ 207 ]   Three-tier Spring Application, Domain-Driven Design                  qat.setQuantity qat.getQuantity   - item. getQuantity   ;                 availableItems.put qat.getItem  .getFruitType  . getId  .toString  , qat ;                 result = true;             }         }         return result;     }      private Map  availableItems;     private Map > reservedItems; }  Factories In the interaction of the user with the application layer, the domain object must be  available because its creation instantiation may involve several objects. Therefore,  factory objects are used.  package it.freshfruits.domain.factories;  public interface CustomerFactory {     public Customer getCustomer String idCustomer ;     public Customer getCurrentCustomer  ; }  package it.freshfruits.domain.factory;  import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;  import it.freshfruits.application.repository.CustomerRepository; import it.freshfruits.domain.entity.Customer; import it.freshfruits.security.SecurityUtils;     good candidate for customerCache @Component "customerFactory"  public class CustomerFactoryImpl implements CustomerFactory {      public Customer getCurrentCustomer   {         return customerRepository.selectCustomer SecurityUtils. getIdCustomer   ;     }      public Customer getCustomer String idCustomer  {  [ 208 ]   Chapter 6          return customerRepository.selectCustomer idCustomer ;     }      @Autowired     private CustomerRepository customerRepository; }  As we can see from the implementation of CustomerFactory, we could recover  it during the interactions with the UI. But after the creation, it is better to keep it  in cache instead of recovering it every time from the database. In fact, this is an  excellent class for a cache that is transparent with AOP.  In this way, the result we obtain is that the Customer object remains alive and  available in the cache. When the Customer object is persisted, it will be eliminated  from the cache.  A good strategy is to retrieve the Customer after the login and to put it in the cache.  A Spring handler interceptor makes this Customer available as a request attribute to  the UI to provide its functionality to the application's users.  At the end of the session, a session listener removes the customer from the cache.  In the next chapter, we will see these operations of insertion and elimination from  the AOP cache.  Repositories Repositories are the classes that deal with persistence and are used by the domain  classes. In the implementation of Customer, we have seen that two repositories   are used: OrderRepository, which persists the order of a Customer and its  OrderItems, or populates an order with the different items from the database;   and CustomerRepository:  package it.freshfruits.application.repository;  import it.freshfruits.domain.entity.Customer;  import java.util.List;  public interface CustomerRepository {     public String getIdCustomer String username ;     public Boolean saveCustomer Customer customer ;     public String insertCustomer Customer customer ;     public Boolean updateCustomer Customer customer ;  [ 209 ]   Three-tier Spring Application, Domain-Driven Design     public Boolean disableCustomer String id ;        public Boolean deleteCustomer String id ;        public Customer selectCustomer String id ;        public List  selectCustomers  ;        public List  selectDisabledCustomers  ;        public Boolean isPresent String name ; }  The following CustomerRepositoryImpl is the implementation of the  CustomerRepository. This implementation uses Apache iBATIS  http:  ibatis. apache.org , a data mapper, to perform the storage on database.  package it.freshfruits.application.repository;  import it.freshfruits.domain.entity.Customer; import it.freshfruits.domain.entity.CustomerImpl; import it.freshfruits.util.Constants;  import java.util.List;  import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier; import org.springframework.orm.ibatis.SqlMapClientTemplate; import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;  import com.ibatis.sqlmap.client.SqlMapClient;  @Repository "customerRepository"  public class CustomerRepositoryImpl extends SqlMapClientTemplate  implements CustomerRepository {     public Boolean saveCustomer Customer customer  {        if  customer.getId  .toString  .equals Constants.ID_NEW   {           return !insertCustomer customer .equals null  ?

Its configuration files  customer.xml, order.xml  follow. In them we can see the  order fields that correspond to orderItems populated with selectOrderItems,   and fruit populated with selectFruitType  present in another file .  iBatis maps the row of the resultset with an object.  In the following file, we see an alias  typeAlias tag  of the Customer class with the  name customer.  In the tag resultMap we see the effective mapping between the column of the table  in the database and the properties available through set* and get* methods of the  object  Customer in this case . This mapping has the name resultCustomer.  After this mapping, we see the query in the database and the resultMap to map the  row during the select and the insert update delete operations.

We have seen how to use the annotation @Configurable to use IoC in domain  objects that aren't Spring bean, and how provide persistence to the entities with  Apache iBATIS.  In the next chapter, we will see the other parts of the sample application.  [ 219 ]    Three-tier Spring Application,  Tests and AOP  This chapter continues the sample application described in Chapter 6.   Here is a brief outline of the topics that will be covered in this chapter:         Application layer and user interface  Tests AOP  Application layer and user interface To be used by the users, the Domain Classes have to be used by the controllers that  form the application layer. This layer coordinates and interprets the commands given  on the User Interface  UI , which is the HTML pages seen by the final user. Now we will see some controllers that are part of the UI.  CustomerController lets the customer interact with the store. The names of the  methods of the Controller are:               Create: To perform creation of a new order  save: To save the order show: To show the customer details order: To show the content of the order items: To show the items contained in the order remove: To remove an item from the order   Three-tier Spring Application, Tests and AOP  The controller is built through Spring MVC annotation. The class is marked as  controller with the @Controller annotation with the name customerController.  Each method is marked with @RequestMapping to assign the HTTP URL used to call  the method on the controller.  Every method returns a ModelAndView object that contains the logical template name  and the name and value of the objects to show in the template.  To perform actions on the Customer object, every method uses UiUtils to obtain the  customer object corresponding to user logged in.  package it.freshfruits.ui;  import it.freshfruits.domain.entity.Order; import it.freshfruits.ui.util.UiUtils;  import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;  import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam; import org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView;  @Controller "customerController"  public class CustomerController{     @RequestMapping " customer.create.page"     public ModelAndView create HttpServletRequest req  {       return new ModelAndView "customer create", "result", UiUtils. getCustomer req .createOrder   ;    }     @RequestMapping " customer.save.page"     public ModelAndView save HttpServletRequest req  {       return new ModelAndView "customer save", "result", UiUtils. getCustomer req .saveOrder   ;    }     @RequestMapping " customer.show.page"     public ModelAndView show HttpServletRequest req  {       return new ModelAndView "customer show", "customer", UiUtils. getCustomer req  ;    }     @RequestMapping " customer.order.page"     public ModelAndView order HttpServletRequest req  {       return new ModelAndView "customer order", "order", UiUtils. getOrder req  ;  [ 222 ]   Chapter 7     }     @RequestMapping " customer.items.page"     public ModelAndView items HttpServletRequest req  {       return new ModelAndView "customer items", "items", UiUtils. getOrder req .getOrderItems   ;    }     @RequestMapping " customer.remove.page"     public ModelAndView remove @RequestParam "id"  String id,  HttpServletRequest req           throws Exception {        Order order = UiUtils.getOrder req ;       return order.removeOrderItem order.getId  .toString  , id  ?              new ModelAndView "customer items", "items", order. getOrderItems   :             new ModelAndView "customer remove", "result", false ;    } }  To support the controller in its task, the CustomerInterceptor adds the Customer  object to the request before the work of the controller  CustomerInterceptor acts   as a servlet filter .  In this way, the controller code is cleaner and has only one responsibility.  The intercepor contains the method preHandle, which is executed before   the controller. The interceptor sets the Customer object as an attribute of   the HttpServletRequest.

As a testing framework we use  Unit 4.5 with the use of annotations and for   the preparation of repositories before and after tests we employ DbUnit.  For   details about  Unit see: http:  www.junit.org, for details about DbUnit see:   http:  dbunit.sourceforge.net.   The main class is AllTests, marked with @RunWith Suite.class  to act   as TestSuite.  In the @SuiteClasses annotation, we put the classes that contain the tests.  The annotated setup method with @BeforeClass contains the initialization of Spring  applicationContext; the annotated tearDown method with   @AfterClass destroys  the ApplicationContext and closes the DbUnit connection.   The folders that contain the tests have packages identical to the classes. This is to  have access to the classes that have visibility only for the package, so that the test  classes can test their targets.  We have three main classes to perform the tests: first, the unit tests; second, the  integration tests where Spring and the application context are used; and a third   suite that performs all the tests together.

We've seen what DDD is and what its philosophy is, and how it can be applied using  AOP and Spring to use IoC on domain objects instantiated outside Spring using  Aspect 's weaver.  We've seen how to adopt Aspects to improve implementation by centralizing the  logic of crosscutting functionalities among classes.   We've improved the application's speed, avoiding calls to the database in a  transparent way, which without AOP would have been unavoidable for the  application layer.  We've also employed AOP for the authorization part with Spring Security.  As an exercise, the reader will be able to apply the other aspects described in   the previous chapters as well, which we left out for the sake of brevity in this   partial application.  We've used  Unit, DbUnit, Spring, and SpringIDE A DT in Eclipse.  In the next chapter will see in detail how to install the whole development  environment on Ubuntu Linux, on apple MacOSX, and on Windows XP, and   how to make the best use of these tools during development.  [ 271 ]    Develop with AOP Tools   To create a working environment for Spring AOP development on Canonical  Ubuntu Linux 8.10, Apple MacOSX 10.5.6, or Windows XP, we need to:            Download and install the Integrated Development Environment  IDE   Eclipse, Spring IDE, and A DT plug-ins  Download and install the Apache Tomcat servlet container Download and install the PostgreSQL database Download the Spring full distribution  In this chapter we will see how to install the whole development environment on  Canonical Ubuntu Linux 8.10, Apple MacOSX 10.5.6, and Windows XP, including  the  ava Development Kit, the IDE  Eclipse, the Eclipse plug-ins Spring IDE, and  AJDT, which allow Checking the Spring and AOP configurations.  We're also going to see how to install the database PostgreSQL 8.3, create the  application's database, and install the servlet engine Tomcat 6.0.x.  Our aim is to have a development environment, and not a production one. Therefore,  we won't deal with the permissions that must be correctly set in a production.  At the end of the chapter, we'll have an environment ready to employ and modify  the example application of Chapter 6.  Java Development Kit A prerequisite is to have  ava Development Kit 1.5 or upward on your PC Mac.    Develop with AOP Tools  Spring Go to http:  www.springsource.org  and click on the entry "Downloads", and  download the latest version of Spring  Spring 2.5.6 at the time of writing this book ,  choose the "with dependencies" package that contains the  ARs of all the projects  supported by Spring.  This distribution also contains the  ARs of the third-party software that we will use  in all the examples of the book.  Source code for the examples described in the book is available online.  For each chapter there is a folder where you can find the file which_jars.txt that  lists the JAR files from the Spring distribution you have to include in each project to  make it run. For 3rd-party libraries not included in the Spring with-dependencies  distribution, you can find instructions to get them on the Web.  Eclipse After downloading Eclipse  3.4.1 or upward  unpack and run it. You must install  some plug-ins.  In this section we will see which plug-ins should be installed, and how to install and   use them.  [ 274 ]   Chapter 8  Eclipse plug-ins  Linux, MacOSX, and  Windows   The Eclipse plug-ins provide rich features such as code autocompletion of Spring  beans, a visual explorer for bean dependencies, management of resources and  automatic syntax checking for configuration files.  We're going to see two plug-ins: SpringIDE and A DT  Aspect  Development Tool .  SpringIDE SpringIDE provides an autocompletion of the beans in the XML files, and checks if  the classes exist and if the XML is well-formed. A "red signal" on the wrong XML line  appears if an error is found.  SpringIDE provides a visual graph to see the dependencies between your beans.  To install the SpringIDE in your eclipse installation, go to http:  springide.org  blog, and copy the link to the latest version of the plug-in.  The current link is http:  springide.org updatesite . Copy this link in   your clipboard.  Now, to install the plug-in, let's go in Eclipse to Help  Software Update Add site  and copy the link http:  springide.org updatesite .      [ 275 ]   Develop with AOP Tools  After reading the remote site, Eclipse shows the available options provided by   the plug-in.  We select the visible entries and we confirm the choice.  [ 276 ]   Once the installation is complete, we have a Spring tab in Eclipse, always reachable  with Window  Show view  Spring explorer.  Chapter 8  To enable the plug-in on the current project, add the Spring nature command.     [ 277 ]   Develop with AOP Tools  Go to the project name and right-click the mouse. You can see a Spring tool label  that has an arrow with some label. Click Add Spring nature, a small blue S appears  near the project name.  Now a folder with project name and Spring symbols appears inside Spring explorer.  If you click on the folder a menu appears. Now you can choose the type of work you  want SpringIDE do for you after you add the configuration files to the project.       SpringIDE enables bean searching and is useful when you have a large number of  beans, or if you find pointcuts in the XML configuration. You can find all the SpringIDE features in Window  Customize perspective, and in  the voice Shortcuts and Commands in the label that starts with Spring.   [ 278 ]      Chapter 8  AJDT AspectJ Development Tool  AJDT  allows us to check whether the pointcuts are  correctly written, indicating on which methods they act. This is shown by arrows  beside of the methods.   A DT checks both annotations and XML, using different arrow icons to indicate the  target of an advice.  This is indicated by small arrows with different orientation to indicate the type of  advice  before, after, and around . This is very helpful to understand whether a  pointcut is well-formed or not.  Another feature is an AOP trace view that shows how Aspect  performs. Now to install the plug-in, let's go in Eclipse to Help  Software Update    Available Software. In the following image, Eclipse shows the selectable items; choose the AspectJ  Development Tools items.  [ 279 ]   Develop with AOP Tools  Check and install.   In the Spring explorer window, A DT adds the arrows to indicate "advised" when the  pointcut advises some classes, and on the Spring beans to tell "advised by" pointcut.  In the following image AJDT is in action in the Spring config files:  In the following image, A DT acts on annotated classes:     [ 280 ]      Chapter 8  The arrows enabled by A DT indicate the type of advice.  A DT doesn't work on aspects declared in META-INF aop.xml.  Apache Tomcat Apache Tomcat is a Servlet container and allows deployment of web applications,  based on the servlet application model.  Spring MVC, used in Chapter 7, is based on Spring DispatcherServlet.  Now we'll see how to download, install, and configure Tomcat on Linux, MacOSX,  and Microsoft Windows.  Ubuntu Linux Go to the Tomcat site at http:  tomcat.apache.org .   [ 281 ]   Develop with AOP Tools  The Apache Tomcat home page shows the Tomcat version, according to the Servlet  and JSP specification version.  We choose the latest version  6.0.18 at the time of writing the book  from   apache-tomcat-6.0.18.tar.gz and download it, as shown in the following image:  Before unpacking and running Tomcat, we must create a Tomcat user with limited  privileges to execute it.  Create the Tomcat user with the following shell command:  sudo adduser tomcat  [ 282 ]   In the following image we see the result of the adduser command, like adding the  new group tomcat, and setting the password for this new user.  Chapter 8  After creating the Tomcat user, we unpack the Tomcat distribution with this  command  the sudo command requires administration privileges  :  sudo tar –xvzf apache-tomcat-6.0.18.tar.gz   [ 283 ]   Develop with AOP Tools  In the following image we see the unpacked folders inside Tomcat:  Now we move the output directory apache-tomcat-6.0.18 and rename it for  convenience as tomcat-6.0.18  renaming it is an optional step .  sudo mv . apache-tomcat-6.0.18  usr local tomcat-6.0.18 Now we move to the new Tomcat location with this command:  cd  usr local Then we change the folder's owner with the command:  sudo chown –R tomcat . tomcat-6.0.18   [ 284 ]   Now we can log in as a Tomcat user with:  su tomcat and start Tomcat with the command:  sh . startup.sh In the following image we see all these commands and their output:  Chapter 8  [ 285 ]   Develop with AOP Tools  To see if Tomcat is up and verify that everything is fine, let's open a web browser at  http:  localhost:8080:  MacOSX Now we see the installation of Apache Tomcat on MacOSX. The steps are less, but it  is more insecure, and is suggested only for a development machine.  To get Apache Tomcat, go to http:  tomcat.apache.org  and then under   download, click on the Tomcat 6.x build  6.0.18 at the time of writing the book    apache-tomcat-6.0.18.tar.gz and download it.  Create a folder in the filesystem tomcat_home   Users max developer   tomcat_home in the example  and unpack it inside.  [ 286 ]   In the shell, go to the folder bin and launch startup.sh with the command:  sh startup.sh &  Chapter 8  To see if Tomcat is up, let's open a web browser at http:  localhost:8080 to  verify that everything is fine.  Microsoft Windows Now we shall see the installation of Apache Tomcat on Microsoft Windows   XP, the steps are fewer, but it is more unsecure, and suggested only for a  development machine. To download Tomcat go to http:  tomcat.apache.org , click on the Download   Tomcat 6.x item, choose apache-tomcat-6.0.18.zip and download it. Now, create  a directory tomcat_home and extract the ZIP file in this folder.  [ 287 ]   Develop with AOP Tools  The following image shows the Tomcat folder content.  Execute the startup.bat script in the bin\ folder.  To see if Tomcat is up, let's open a web browser at URL http:  localhost:8080 to  verify that everything was fine.  Common steps for Linux, MacOSX,   and Windows Now we will see how to deploy the prototype application freshfruitstore shown  in Chapters 6 and 7.  Create, in   conf, the folder Catalina and localhost inside it, so that  you will have conf\Catalina\localhost where you will copy the file sffs.xml  contained in the tomcat folder of the SpringFreshFruitStore application.  [ 288 ]   In SpringFreshFruitStore, you can find the structure and the files as shown in the  following image:  Chapter 8  In the tomcat 6.0.x bin folder you can find a readme with instructions to enable   MX support in Tomcat.  In the conf Catalina localhost folder you can find the sffs.xml deployment file.  You only need to put the path in the filesystem in the   and change  username password url if needed, according to your installation after putting   the sffs.xml inside  Tomcat conf Catalina localhost.  The tag   is a class that has the same effect as javaagent:   spring-agent.jar in the test classes. In other words, it is responsible for the   Load-Time Weaver in Tomcat.    SpringFreshFruitsStore www " debug="0">  <Loader loaderClass="org.springframework.instrument.classloading. tomcat.TomcatInstrumentableClassLoader"    useSystemClassLoaderAsParent="false" >  <Resource name="jdbc sffs" auth="Container" type="javax.sql.

PostgreSQL PostgreSQL is an open-source object-relational database system.  We use PostgreSQL to store the information used by the SpringFreshfruitStore  application and to run the tests.   We will see how to download and install PostgreSQL on Linux MacOSX, and   Microsoft Windows.  Ubuntu Linux  Let's see how to install PostgreSQL as a service on Linux with Ubuntu   Package Manager.  [ 290 ]   Open the Synaptic Package Manager and search for PostgreSQL.  We check PostgreSQL.  Chapter 8     [ 291 ]   Develop with AOP Tools  We look for the entry pgadmin and check it.  We install it.  [ 292 ]   Chapter 8  Now we have to set a password on postgres. In the shell we write: sudo su postgres -c psql template1 postgres=  will appear. We key in ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'postgres';—in this way  we have set the password postgres to the user postgres; postgres= will appear.  Finally again we key in \q to end. In the following image we see the command in the shell:  To start, we go to System Tools  pgAdmin III.   [ 293 ]   Develop with AOP Tools  MacOSX Let's see how to download and install PostgreSQL as a service on MacOSX.   Go to http:  www.postgresql.org download macosx and you will reach the link.  Download it, then unpack it and click twice on postgresql-8.3.x-osx.app to start   the installation.  [ 294 ]   Chapter 8  The installation path is the first choice.   The installation is now ready to begin.  [ 295 ]   Develop with AOP Tools  We disable Launch Stack Builder.  When the installation is finished, we will have the entry PostgreSQL 8.3 in the  Applications folder.   Microsoft Windows Let's see how to download and install PostgreSQL as a service on   Microsoft Windows.  [ 296 ]   Go to http:  www.postgresql.org ftp binary v8.3.3 win32 and you will  reach the link:   Chapter 8  Download postgresql-8.3.3-2.zip, unpack it, and double-click on   postgresql-8.3.msi to start the installation.  [ 297 ]      Develop with AOP Tools  The setup wizard lets you select the installation language, installation path,   and options.  We will be asked if we want to install it as a service, and a user for the service is  created  we could subsequently disable it .         [ 298 ]   We choose the encoding UTF-8 and the password for the user administrator.  Chapter 8  We choose to install PL pgsql.      [ 299 ]   Develop with AOP Tools  We enable adminpack.  The installation is now ready to begin.         [ 300 ]   We disable Launch Stack Builder.  Chapter 8  When the installation is finished, we will have the entry PostgreSQL Database  Server 8.3 in the services, as shown in the image:         and pgAadmin III in Programs:     [ 301 ]   Develop with AOP Tools  Common steps for Linux, Apple MacOSX, and  Microsoft Windows Connect to the database with the administration password and create the user sffs  with your preferred password  such as sffs    [ 302 ]   Create the database with name sffs.  Chapter 8  Open the SQL window and insert the text contained in dump.sql  in the db folder of  the SpringFreshFruitsStore example application .  [ 303 ]   Develop with AOP Tools  If you already have a PostgreSQL installation and you only create  the database, check if you have to install pl pgsql. In accordance,  uncomment or comment the instructions: CREATE PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE plpgsql; ALTER PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE plpgsql OWNER TO postgres; in the SQL script. Launch the query and wait for the end of the operation.  JDBC Driver To connect the application to the database or to run the tests, the PostgreSQL  DBC  driver JAR file is necessary.  [ 304 ]   To download it let's go to the web site http:  jdbc.postgresql.org.  Chapter 8  Choose the appropriate driver version for the PostgreSQL version installed.   After choosing the JAR version and downloading the file, copy postgresql-8.3-603. jdbc3.jar in   lib and in libExt in the SpringFreshFruits folder.  [ 305 ]   Develop with AOP Tools  Summary In this chapter, we saw how to set up the development environment on Ubuntu  Linux, Apple MaxOSX, and Microsoft Windows XP. The tools needed are the  DK,  Eclipse IDE with SpringIDE and A DT plug-ins, SpringFramework, Apache Tomcat,  and PostgreSQL to make our AOP application persistent and available on the Web.   It's now time to act in the world of Aspect-Oriented Programming, where we have  been introduced by SpringAOP.  Have fun with Spring and AOP!

Developing powerful web applications with clean, manageable code makes the maintenance process much easier. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is the easiest and quickest way to achieve such results. Spring is the only Java framework to offer AOP features. The combined power of Spring and AOP gives a powerful and flexible platform to develop and maintain feature-rich web applications quickly. This book will help you to write clean, manageable code for your Java applications quickly, utilizing the combined power of Spring and AOP. You will master the concepts of AOP by developing several real-life AOP-based applications with the Spring Framework, implementing the basic components of Spring AOP: Advice, Joinpoint, Pointcut, and Advisor. This book will teach you everything you need to know to use AOP with Spring. It starts by explaining the AOP features of Spring and then moves ahead with configuring Spring AOP and using its core classes, with lot of examples. It moves on to explain the AspectJ support in Spring. Then you will develop a three-layered example web application designed with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and built with Test-Driven Development methodology using the full potential of AOP for security, concurrency, caching, and transactions.
